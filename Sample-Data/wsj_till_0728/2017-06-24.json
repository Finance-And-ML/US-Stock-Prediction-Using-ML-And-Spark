[{"content": "BUENOS AIRES\u2014Former President       Cristina Kirchner       filed papers on Saturday to run for Argentina\u2019s Senate, launching a campaign that could, if elected, give her congressional immunity from federal prosecution for alleged money laundering and racketeering during her presidency.The candidacy thrusts Mrs. Kirchner back into the spotlight of Argentine politics, which she dominated as president from 2008 through 2015. It also promises to challenge President       Mauricio Macri       and further fragment a deeply divided Peronist political movement, which she once led, as it struggles to regroup after a historic defeat in Argentina\u2019s 2015 election.The Senate race would be considered a referendum both on her legacy and the performance of her successor, Mr. Macri. A market-friendly former businessman who has reversed Mrs. Kirchner\u2019s populist policies, Mr. Macri could benefit if her campaign forces voters to choose between his promises of economic modernization and her legacy of corruption scandals.\u201cHer candidacy will help crystalize the conversation Argentina is having about the past and the future, and allow Macri\u2019s Pro party to present itself as the future,\u201d said       Juan Cruz D\u00edaz,        managing director of Cefeidas, a risk advisory firm.\u201cIt will polarize the election the way       Marine Le Pen       polarized France,\u201d Mr. Cruz D\u00edaz said.But the campaign also poses risks for Mr. Macri as he invites foreign investors to bet on Argentina. Mrs. Kirchner\u2019s policies, including price caps, currency controls and years of double-digit inflation, were deeply unpopular with investors. Many executives say they want proof that Mr. Macri\u2019s pro-business policies will last before they open their wallets.On June 20, the MSCI Emerging Markets Index postponed a decision to include Argentina--which is now considered a \u201cfrontier\u201d market--in its emerging-market stock index. The MSCI based its decision on concerns that Mr. Macri\u2019s policies may not be durable. Argentine stocks tanked on the news.The campaign could also become rough. Mrs. Kirchner faces multiple criminal investigations and she has been indicted in three separate federal cases.In one case, a judge ruled that Mrs. Kirchner ran a criminal \u201cgang\u201d aimed at profiting from the illegal disbursal of government funds for infrastructure projects. In another case, she was indicted over accusations she ordered Argentina\u2019s central bank to illegally trade derivatives, costing the country about $5.5 billion.Officials in Mr. Macri\u2019s Pro party plan to refer frequently to these cases during the campaign, hoping this will favor the party\u2019s chances of gaining congressional seats.Mrs. Kirchner has denied the allegations and accused Mr. Macri, judges and the media of conspiring to distract attention from his own economic record. She says that poverty has risen sharply since Mr. Macri took office.\u201cI\u2019m not afraid of going to jail,\u201d Mrs. Kirchner said last year.If Mrs. Kirchner wins in October, she would be eligible to run for the presidency again in 2019, when Mr. Macri finishes his first four-year term.Pollsters say she has a solid base of support in Argentina\u2019s largest province, Buenos Aires, where she is campaigning. Mr. Macri\u2019s chief pollster,       Jaime Duran Barba,        has said she would be a formidable candidate and get at least 25% of the vote in the province. In an election in which the Peronist movement--named after late Argentine strongman       Juan Domingo Per\u00f3n      --is split among various candidates, that would likely be enough to win.A year-and-a-half after leaving office, however, Mrs. Kirchner is deeply unpopular elsewhere in Argentina. Many once-loyal supporters have distanced themselves. Key Peronists such as Salta Province Gov.       Juan Manuel Urtubey       have supported Macri.Mrs. Kirchner\u2019s approval rating was 32.8% in late May, according to pollster Management & Fit. Her disapproval rating was 47.5%, the highest since early 2015, when a federal prosecutor accused her of conspiring with Iran to cover up a 1994 terrorist bombing in Buenos Aires.Mrs. Kirchner denied that allegation and two courts later dismissed the case, saying no crime had been committed. The prosecutor,       Alberto Nisman,        was found dead, with a bullet in his head, hours before he was to present his case in Congress. The circumstances surrounding his death were never clarified.Mariel Fornoni, who oversaw the Management & Fit poll, said Mrs. Kirchner would be a good senate candidate because her base of support\u2014a third of the electorate\u2014is rock solid. But the rest of the electorate \u201cdestests\u201d her, Mrs. Fornoni said, limiting Mrs. Kirchner\u2019s presidential potential.\u201cShe would be a very bad presidential candidate in 2019,\u201d Mrs. Fornoni said.Still, Mrs. Kirchner\u2019s supporters are elated she is running. The former president ramped up spending on social programs during her tenure, winning support among the poor.At a recent rally, Mrs. Kirchner surrounded herself with women and minorities, who she said were struggling under Mr. Macri. The rally, attended by tens of thousands of people, underscored her supporters\u2019 loyalty.\u201cMacri hasn\u2019t kept his campaign promises,\u201d said Ana Moreno, a 62-year-old psychologist, who was at the event. \u201cElderly people don\u2019t have enough money to get by, and this government cares only about the rich. We need Cristina to be president again.\u201d\u2014       Alberto Messer       contributed to this article.Write to Taos Turner at taos.turner@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-24 22:11:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/cristina-kirchner-files-candidacy-papers-for-argentinas-senate-1498356702", "news_title": "Cristina Kirchner Files Candidacy Papers for Argentina\u2019s Senate", "keywords": "argentine politics, corruption allegations, kirchner indictments,peronists, senate candidate, senate race,Cristina Kirchner,Mauricio Macri,political,general news,corruption,crime,legal action,money laundering,financial crime,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,elections,national,presidential elections,upper house"}, {"content": "In the fight against Type 1 diabetes, drugmakers are pursuing a new line of attack: creating cells that help the body beat the condition.In Type 1 diabetes, the immune system attacks pancreas cells that make insulin, a hormone that helps cells absorb sugar. Some 1.25 million Americans have the condition, which raises the risk of heart disease, nerve damage, kidney failure and other illnesses. Patients typically tackle the disease with diligent glucose testing and insulin therapy, used to control blood sugar or glucose.In the past few years, scientists have made significant progress in their efforts to free patients from insulin therapy. Researchers have learned more about how to generate insulin-producing cells in a laboratory and place them into patients, while protecting the cells from the immune system, which would ordinarily reject them. Some are reprogramming the patient\u2019s own cells to retrain them to fight the disease.\u201cIt is [in] no way an easy life trying to manage blood glucose,\u201d says Julia Greenstein, vice president, discovery research, for JDRF, a nonprofit that funds research into Type 1 diabetes.Currently, a pancreas transplant is the gold standard for freeing patients from insulin therapy because it enables the highest percentage of patients to remain independent of the treatment over the long term, says Peter Stock, a professor of surgery at the University of California, San Francisco, and co-director of the Pancreatic Islet Cell Transplant program at UCSF Medical Center.But a pancreas transplant is a major surgery, and not every patient has a heart healthy enough to tolerate the procedure. Transplants also require immune-suppressing drugs, which increase the risk of infection and certain cancers. And the procedure requires donor pancreases, which are scarce.A less invasive option, which has been around since the 1980s, is transplanting islets, or clusters of pancreas cells that include insulin-making beta cells. Patients receive them through a direct injection into the vein that leads to the liver. Some islet-transplant recipients can forgo insulin therapy for several years.Yet islet transplants carry some of the same downsides as full organ transplants. A pancreas must be removed from a deceased donor to obtain the islets, even though the organ isn\u2019t actually being transplanted. And the treatment requires immune-suppressing medication to prevent the patient\u2019s body from rejecting donated cells. So, like organ transplants, islet procedures are reserved for a small minority of patients.The cures under study now would remove the need for a donor pancreas. In the first method, cells that could free patients from insulin therapy are generated in a laboratory and then transplanted into a patient.\u201cEveryone\u2019s waiting for the next generation of beta-cell replacement that hopefully will change the whole way in which we treat diabetes,\u201d says Gordon Weir, a Harvard Medical School professor and diabetes researcher at the Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston. \u201cIn spite of the excitement and extraordinary things that have happened in the last 10 years, there are still a lot of challenges.\u201dBiotechnology companies ViaCyte Inc. and Semma Therapeutics Inc. hope to solve the donor-shortage problem by coaxing stem cells to mature eventually into other cells that make insulin and other hormones.In 2014 ViaCyte, of San Diego, began clinical trials of progenitor cells\u2014which turn into pancreas cells\u2014housed in a device that protected them from the immune system. Company scientists hoped a network of blood vessels would grow on the device implanted under the skin. Then oxygen, glucose and other nutrients could diffuse through its tiny pores, allowing cells inside to thrive and function. Meanwhile, insulin and other hormones would diffuse out.But in the study, certain immune cells interfered with the creation of this blood-vessel network. ViaCyte is hoping to improve the device to prevent this response, and resume clinical studies within 24 months.Meanwhile, it is starting new studies of a device with larger pores that let blood vessels enter and nourish the progenitors directly. Since this approach wouldn\u2019t protect the cells inside the device from the immune system, patients would need immune-suppressing drugs. But the treatment could make cures more accessible to patients at high risk for life-threatening diabetes complications who would also be islet-transplant candidates, according to Chief Executive       Paul Laikind.Semma, meanwhile, formed in 2014 around research from the Harvard Stem Cell Institute that led to a means of generating billions of insulin-making beta cells in the lab. Similar to ViaCyte, the cells would be placed in a device that is implanted in the body and protects the cells from the immune system.Semma, of Cambridge, Mass., hasn\u2019t said when human studies will begin. \u201cWe want to create hope but not hype,\u201d says CEO       Robert Millman.Other companies are taking a different approach to working with cells. Instead of replacing those that make insulin,             Caladrius Biosciences Inc.       and Parvus Therapeutics Inc. seek to salvage and restore function to cells that are damaged.Parvus drugs reprogram immune cells that harm the body\u2019s own pancreas cells into \u201cregulatory T cells\u201d that suppress diabetes. This is \u201creprogramming a killer to [be] a peacemaker,\u201d says Parvus Chief Scientific Officer Pere Santamaria. Parvus, based in Calgary, Alberta, has licensed rights to this Navacim technology in Type 1 diabetes to         Novartis AG      .Caladrius is harvesting the patient\u2019s own regulatory T cells, which aren\u2019t functioning normally, says Douglas Losordo, senior vice president, clinical, medical and regulatory affairs, and chief medical officer of Caladrius. Caladrius then increases the number of these cells, repairs them and returns them to the patient in a bid to restore balance to the immune system. Caladrius, of Basking Ridge, N.J., is testing the treatment in clinical trials.Patients are following curative research efforts closely. Dara Melnick, of Woodbury, N.Y., was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes when she was 8 years old and is now 36. She said she tests her blood sugar 20 times a day but remains concerned about future diabetes-related health risks.\u201cA cure would be the sweetest thing I could ever taste,\u201d Ms. Melnick says.Mr. Gormley is a special writer for The Wall Street Journal in Boston.

Oracle demonstrated improved speed after losing all four races last weekend, evidence that five days of practice and round-the-clock work by the shore crew had paid off.Oracle\u2019s victory came after the U.S. team lost the first race, making a series of mistakes that included its second too-early start of the Cup.The U.S. now needs six more victories to retain the trophy in this year\u2019s format, in which the first team to get seven points\u2014with one point per race\u2014wins. New Zealand needs three.During the last Cup in 2013, the U.S. was within one race of elimination before storming back to win eight straight races in what many consider one of the greatest comeback in sports.\u201cThe important thing is the boat\u2019s faster,\u201d said Oracle skipper Jimmy Spithill.Spithill last week said his team knew how to recover from a deficit and would use every hour of the five-day break in the series to practice and improve the boat. Saturday, it showed. Oracle took an early lead in the day\u2019s second heat, which ended up being the tightest race so far.Oracle surged ahead decisively near the end, in position to accelerate through the penultimate turn while the Kiwis were forced to slow. That gave Oracle an edge the team didn\u2019t relinquish on the way to an 11-second victory.\u201cIt was great to see a bit of fight out of these boys,\u201d said Peter Burling, New Zealand\u2019s helmsman, in a joint press conference.\u201cIt\u2019s only just beginning, mate,\u201d replied Spithill, an Australian.Oracle\u2019s improved speed was evident from the first race of the day, though errors doomed the team\u2019s chances of winning that heat. The U.S. team crossed the starting line early, requiring the sailors to slow down and allow New Zealand to zip ahead. The U.S. soon recovered, catching a favorable shift in the wind to pass the Kiwis as the two boats zigzagged back and forth. Later, the U.S. earned another penalty for failing to sufficiently keep clear of the Kiwis on another crossing.Spithill later said he disagreed with the call, but Oracle also botched a maneuver, allowing the Kiwis to extend the lead. Despite the U.S.\u2019s speed gains, New Zealand won by about two minutes, the biggest gap of the regatta.Some sailors said the large difference between the two teams\u2019 speeds had closed during the week\u2019s break. Oracle took steps to lighten the boat, including scrapping a pair of bicycle stations. The U.S. team had added them after New Zealand arrived with a boat that used bikes in place of the hand-cranked winches typically used to power the Cup boats\u2019 hydraulic-control systems.\u201cIt\u2019s a boat race now,\u201d said Nathan Outteridge, helmsman for the Swedish Artemis Racing team that lost to the Kiwis in the qualifying finals. \u201cBoth teams looked very comparable.\u201dFor New Zealand, a win off Bermuda would ease the pain of the 2013 defeat and return the Cup to a nation that prides itself on sailing prowess but last won in 2000.Ellison\u2019s team is trying to extend its winning streak to three.Losing would deal a major blow to the Silicon Valley tycoon, who has spent hundreds of millions on his sailing efforts over the years and came into the 2017 Cup enjoying the defending champion\u2019s privilege of setting the terms of the regatta.Oracle headed back onto the water immediately after Saturday\u2019s news conference to keep training in advance of Sunday\u2019s heats.\u201cGetting that first victory was important today, but I believe there is more speed in the tank,\u201d Spithill said.Corrections & AmplificationsOracle\u2019s win came in the second of two races on Saturday.

The exterior facade is suspected of having contributed to the quick spread of the fire that incinerated west London\u2019s Grenfell Tower on June 14, killing at least 79.Authorities are now testing the fire resistance of cladding used in high-rises across the country, Mr. Javid said. All samples examined so far have failed the combustibility test, he said, adding it was very important that landlords provide samples for testing \u201cas a matter of urgency.\u201d\u201cWe are now rapidly identifying buildings of concern: samples are being tested very quickly; fire inspectors are checking the safety of the buildings as a whole,\u201d he said.The laboratory handling the samples is able to test 100 of them daily, and further capacity can be provided, he said.The announcement comes after some 650 homes in north London social-housing buildings were evacuated Friday night, following a discovery that the cladding wasn\u2019t fire retardant.More than 3,000 people were being temporarily relocated, said a spokesman for the north London local authority handling the evacuation of the four residential towers.The decision was made due to concerns that, combined with inadequate fire-safety arrangements inside the buildings, the cladding posed too much of a fire risk.A significant number of residents were staying with friends and family, with others being housed in two community centers and checked into hotels, the spokesman said.A failure in testing of the cladding doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that a building will have to be evacuated, Mr. Javid said. A spokesman for Mr. Javid\u2019s department said he had no knowledge of any further planned evacuations.Cladding is often used to make a building more energy efficient or improve its outward appearance. In Grenfell Tower, it was installed as part of an \u00a38.6 million ($11 million) refurbishment last year.U.K. officials have said the cladding on the 24-story Grenfell Tower didn\u2019t meet building standards for high-rises taller than 18 meters, or about 59 feet. But British building industry experts and the British company that supplied the material to Grenfell Tower contractors said it complied with current building codes.The deadly blaze had started in a refrigerator-freezer before it rapidly spread across the tower block, police said Friday, and the external cladding tested in the aftermath failed fire-safety tests.Authorities are considering a range of potential charges, including manslaughter, in connection with the fire, Detective Superintendent Fiona McCormack said Friday.Write to Wiktor Szary at Wiktor.Szary@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-24 18:50:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-k-high-rise-fire-triggers-countrywide-safety-checks-evacuations-1498303850", "news_title": "High-Rises Across England Fail Safety Checks After London Fire", "keywords": "apartment building fire,britian,cladding, evacuations, fire,fire safety, grenfell tower,housing,london,london fire,u.k. department for communities and local government ,united kingdom,affordable housing,political,general news,society,community,disasters,accidents,building fires,explosions,collapses,man-made disasters,politics,international relations,domestic politics,social issues,welfare,social services"}, {"content": "Egyptian President       Abdel Fattah Al Sisi       ratified a disputed 2016 agreement under which his country would transfer control of two strategic Red Sea islands to Saudi Arabia, following through on his assertion this week that the matter was closed.The surrender of the islands, which the Egyptian government insists have always been Saudi, had prompted street protests.\u201cThis matter has been closed and I am only bringing it up again because we have nothing to hide,\u201d Mr. Sisi said in televised comments this week. \u201cYou have entrusted me with this nation and for this I will be held accountable not just before you but also before God.\u201dParliament approved the agreement on June 14 amid chaotic scenes of shouting matches by lawmakers arguing over the deal, whose announcement during an April 2016 visit by Saudi King Salman sparked the largest street protests since Mr. Sisi took office in 2014. Parliament\u2019s approval of the deal sparked a series of small protests this month, but they were swiftly broken up by security forces.Authorities have meanwhile arrested at least 120 people who voiced opposition or took to the streets to protest the agreement. Most of them have since been freed.News of Mr. Sisi\u2019s ratification of the maritime border-demarcation agreement with Saudi Arabia came in a cabinet statement that was issued shortly before sunset, when most were at or heading home to eat iftar\u2014the meal with which Muslims break their fasts during their holy month of Ramadan.A lunar month, Ramadan ends on Saturday and the three-day Muslim Eid al-Fitr holiday begins on Sunday, with many Egyptians planning to take the whole week off to recover from grueling days of 16-hour fasts in sweltering summer heat.The government maintains that the Saudis placed the two islands under Egypt\u2019s protection in the 1950s amid Arab-Israeli tension. Critics say the islands were transferred in exchange for billions of dollars of Saudi aid. The government denies the claim, insisting it would never cede Egyptian territory to anyone.Parliament\u2019s approval of the agreement was secured in defiance of two court rulings in June 2016 and January this year that reaffirmed Egypt\u2019s ownership of the islands.However, the Supreme Constitutional Court on Wednesday annulled those two rulings as well as another two in support of the agreement. It said its decision was made upon a government request and that former tribunals may have infringed upon the prerogatives of the government\u2019s legislative and executive branches.The islands of Tiran and Sanafir are at the mouth of the Gulf of Aqaba.

The New Jersey hospital where the 71-year-old pediatrician was practicing informed him that doctors age 72 and older would have to take a test to assess their physical and mental health\u2014or risk losing their privileges.\u201cWho are they to tell me I can\u2019t practice medicine?\u201d he thought. He was going to fire off an angry response\u2014then took a deep breath. Instead, he did some soul-searching about his abilities, while considering the new policy at Cooper University Health Care in Camden. What was physician competence, Dr. Brown wondered, and how could it be measured?Testing older physicians for mental and physical ability is growing more common. Nearly a fourth of physicians in America are 65 or older, and 40% of these are actively involved in patient care, according to the American Medical Association. Experts at the AMA have suggested that they be screened lest they pose a risk to patients. An AMA working group is considering guidelines.Concern over older physicians\u2019 mental states\u2014and whether it is safe for them to care for patients\u2014has prompted a number of institutions, from Stanford Health Care in Palo Alto, Calif., to Driscoll Children\u2019s Hospital in Corpus Christi, Texas, to the University of Virginia Health System, to adopt age-related physician policies in recent years. The goal is to spot problems, in particular signs of cognitive decline or dementia.Now, as more institutions like Cooper embrace the measures, they are roiling some older doctors and raising questions of fairness, scientific validity\u2014and ageism.\u201cIt is not for the faint of heart, this policy,\u201d said       Ann Weinacker,        66, the former chief of staff at the hospital and professor of medicine at Stanford University who has overseen the controversial efforts to implement age-related screening at Stanford hospital.A group of doctors has been battling Stanford\u2019s age-based physician policies for the past five years, contending they are demeaning and discriminatory. The older doctors got the medical staff to scrap a mental-competency exam aimed at testing for cognitive impairment. Most, like       Frank Stockdale,        an 81-year-old breast-cancer specialist, refused to take it.Stanford hasn\u2019t budged and indeed strengthened one aspect of what it calls the Late Career Practitioner Policy, which involves getting several peer reviews of physicians ages 75 and over by people with whom they work. Dr. Stockdale, who organized the doctors opposing the policies, asks why Stanford can\u2019t apply the policy it to all doctors, not simply the older ones?He noted that the physicians in his group of dissidents have made major contributions to medicine. One helped find a cure for a form of cancer; another is a pioneer in genetic engineering. More than 50 years ago,       Saul Rosenberg,        an 89-year-old oncologist, along with a Stanford radiologist, developed the cure for Hodgkin lymphoma, a cancer of the lymph nodes that had been 100% fatal.\u201cI am quite elderly, and I know what I know and I know what I don\u2019t know,\u201d said Dr. Rosenberg, who still sees patients. \u201cIt is very upsetting that they make it difficult for me to get my hospital privileges.\u201dHe noted that among younger colleagues, there are \u201cphysicians who are alcoholics or drug addicts.\u201d Yet his institution targets older physicians for special screening.Dr. Weinacker acknowledges, \u201cwe have some of the most amazing physicians in the world. But none of us is immune to the effects of aging, and as we age, lots of us function less well, including in some of us the ability to think critically and solve complex problems.\u201dShe said there were policies to screen younger physicians \u201cwhen we have concerns that someone is impaired.\u201d The idea of screening all physicians, she added, is not practical.Older physicians who have mild cognitive dysfunction typically don\u2019t realize it, she said, and their colleagues don\u2019t report them. In a paper published last year in the Journal of Continuing Education in the Health Professions, a group of authors led by an AMA vice president cited studies showing how \u201cincreasing years in practice is associated with decreasing knowledge; lower adherence to evidence-based standards of care for diagnosis, prevention and treatment; and worse patient outcomes.\u201dStudies have found that, on average, knowledge declines over time, but it varies significantly among individual physicians, the AMA says.Meanwhile, a study published in May in the British Medical Journal that looked at the outcomes of hospitalists\u2014doctors who work at inpatient hospital units\u2014found that patients treated by older hospitalists, over 60, have higher mortality than patients cared for by hospitalists under 40 except for physicians with high patient volumes, where there were no age-related differences in mortality.Yet even the study\u2019s senior author,       Anupam Jena,        a 38-year-old associate professor of health-care policy at Harvard Medical School, calls age a \u201ccrude\u201d measure of performance. He argues that hospitals should be analyzing outcomes of all doctors.Dr. Jena also questions the emphasis on mental competence. Poor outcomes are due to outdated skills, he said, not dementia: \u201cThey need to focus on older doctors not because of cognitive impairment but because of their relative lack of familiarity with current treatments.\u201dMartin Makary,        a surgeon and health-quality expert at Johns Hopkins Medicine, found that older physicians have lower paid-malpractice claims than younger doctors. \u201cLet us not make blanket generalizations about age and quality,\u201d said Dr. Makary, who is 44.Dr. Makary looked at so-called \u201cnever events\u201d\u2014catastrophic mistakes such as operating on the wrong patient or the wrong organ, or leaving behind a foreign object in the patient. In a study published in the April 2013 issue of Surgery, he found that physicians 60 and older had the fewest never-events claims.Hospitals say they are trying to be sensitive. \u201cWe are not making our doctors go through this big elaborate psychological evaluation,\u201d said       Dr. Karl Serrao,        who helped develop a screening program for older doctors at Driscoll Children\u2019s Hospital. Doctors age 70 and over see a physician who both gives them a physical checkup and assesses their \u201cfitness to work.\u201dAt Cooper University Health Care,       Anthony Mazzarelli,        a physician and senior executive vice president, said the new policy requiring the mental and physical exams \u201cwasn\u2019t meant to target physicians to not practice. It was to help them practice longer\u201d by reassuring both the hospital and the doctor.That is exactly what       William Sharrar,        a pediatrician, is hoping. \u201cI am 76 years old, so I could retire, but I don\u2019t want to retire because I really love what I do,\u201d Dr. Sharrar said. He wasn\u2019t particularly worried about the competency test, he said; he looked at it as a challenge, like the puzzles and jumbled-word games he loves.Earlier this month, Dr. Sharrar reported to a neuropsychologist for cognitive exams, which took about three hours, with breaks. Sample question: How are a giraffe and an elephant alike? (They are both animals.) \u201cI am not sure the testing correlates with your ability based on 45, 50 years of experience,\u201d he muses. \u201cHow does it correlate with the practice of medicine?\u201dDavid Libon,        the neuropsychologist who administers the tests at Rowan University\u2019s New Jersey Institute for Successful Aging, counters: \u201cI am not asking the questions physicians take to get licenses.\u201d The test, typically for the aged, assesses cognitive function.Dr. Sharrar\u2019s colleague, Dr. Brown, took a different route. The new policy made him confront some physical realities. Numbness in his hands made it hard for him to examine his patients; he worried about missing a mass, and felt he couldn\u2019t practice medicine safely.Now 72, Dr. Brown chose to retire and not take the competency tests. He still questions their validity. The exams may be useful to assess elderly people \u201cto see if they are failing,\u201d he said, but that is different from figuring out if a physician is competent.Write to Lucette Lagnado at lucette.lagnado@wsj.comCorrections & Amplifications   A photo caption with an earlier version of this article labeled Cooper University Health Care incorrectly as Copper Union Hospital.", "news_time": "2017-06-24 13:46:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/when-are-doctors-too-old-to-practice-1498311380", "news_title": "When Are Doctors Too Old to Practice?", "keywords": "doctors,medical training,mental acuity tests,mental health,old doctors,physicians,physician training,practicing medicine ,testing doctors,age discrimination,political,general news,society,community,discrimination,health,social issues,health care,life sciences,healthcare provision"}, {"content": "BIRMINGHAM, Ala.\u2014Floodwaters from tropical storm Cindy covered timberland and fields across the rural Deep South on Saturday, but the sun peeked out enough to offer hope that the worst was over.Swollen by heavy rains and flowing quickly, the Chickasawhay River was out of its banks near the southeastern Mississippi town of Leakesville and nearly 9 feet above flood level with the water still rising. An abandoned bridge spanning the river collapsed earlier in the week.The National Weather Service said the Mississippi coast received nearly a foot of rain over the four-day period ending Saturday, the most in the region.As much as another 3 inches of rain was forecast around Leakesville, a town of 900 people by Sunday, possibly making flooding conditions worse, said Trent Richardson, emergency management director for Greene County.Storms extended from southern Louisiana to northeastern Georgia, but Mr. Richardson said he was encouraged by occasional sunshine and revised projections that showed the Chickasawhay cresting lower than expected by mid-week.\u201cWe\u2019re good right now, but I\u2019m always edgy,\u201d Mr. Richardson said. \u201cWeather is not an exact science.

Neither bank has been accused of wrongdoing.The unaccounted-for sums include a $500 million loan that should have been spent in cash but now can\u2019t be found, the report said. It also includes roughly $800 million out of some $1.5 billion spent on assets that an assessment by an independent expert found should have cost about $700 million, the report stated.Kroll\u2019s report, paid for by the embassy of Sweden in Mozambique, is critical of the way the state-owned companies\u2014MAM, Ematum and ProIndicus\u2014were managed and operated. The report says the companies have had almost no revenue and accuses their senior management of concealing facts and avoiding the auditors.The chief executive of all three companies is Antonio do Rosario, a senior official in Mozambique\u2019s powerful secret service, known as SISE. He declined to comment.A spokesman for the government of Mozambique declined to comment.The loans\u2019 opaque nature was revealed last year when The Wall Street Journal reported they had been kept secret from the public and from subsequent creditors who continued lending to Mozambique without knowing about the past loans. The Journal previously reported the existence of the audit and of the previously undisclosed loans.\u201cGaps remain in understanding how exactly the USD 2 billion was spent, despite considerable efforts to close this gap,\u201d the Kroll report said.\u201cThe differences between prices of the aforementioned assets and services outlined in the invoices provided to ProIndicus and EMATUM by the Contractor, compared to the prices estimated by the independent expert total approximately USD 713 million,\u201d the reported further stated.Regarding the allegedly missing $500 million, the Kroll report said its auditors hadn\u2019t received satisfactory explanations as to how that money had been spent. The report said the money was added into Mozambique\u2019s state budget without seeking parliamentary clearance.\u201cUntil the inconsistencies are resolved, and satisfactory documentation is provided, at least USD 500 million of expenditure of a potentially sensitive nature remains unaudited and unexplained,\u201d the report concluded.The scandal has plunged Mozambique into a financial crisis, with major international donors suspending all-important aid to the extremely poor southern African nation until the money is tracked and accounted for.The International Monetary Fund has suspended a bailout to Mozambique following the revelations and is in discussions with the government for a new bailout. It has pledged to withhold any aid until questions surrounding the earlier loans are resolved. The IMF said it intends to send a staff mission to Mozambique next month in July to discuss the Kroll audit and \u201cpossible follow-up actions, including working with the authorities to address concerns related to the management of public resources.\u201dPrevious published reports about the loans prompted investigations by regulators in the U.K. and Switzerland, as well as at the Securities and Exchange Commission, on the role Credit Suisse and VTB played, as facilitators of the loans. The banks have denied wrongdoing.The Kroll audit confirmed reports that the banks had carved $200 million in fees out of the $2 billion total\u2014a slice well above what is typical for this market. The banks have said they were paid fees appropriate to the specifics of the deals.Mozambique told creditors in October 2016 that it wouldn\u2019t be able to repay them and initiated a debt restructuring.

At one hospital, the bioengineer saw babies lying on cots next to medical equipment destroyed by dust and humidity. As a researcher and designer of medical devices in a lab, she found the trip shockingly eye-opening: \u201cI went in the hospital one person, and I came out a completely different person,\u201d she says. She saw things, she adds, from two perspectives: as an engineer and as a mother.Now, as a professor in the bioengineering department at Rice University in Houston, Dr. Richards-Kortum, 53, has made it her mission to develop inexpensive, simple technology that makes medical care more accessible in developing countries. Last September, she won a $625,000 John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation \u201cgenius\u201d grant for her work.The more than 30 designs she has patented include a pen-size device to instantly diagnose cervical cancer\u2014especially useful in isolated areas, so that women don\u2019t have to return to a faraway doctor for test results. An inexpensive microendoscope can help identify potential oral cancer. Some of her devices are available commercially, while nonprofits and governments distribute others.Her campus organization, the Rice 360\u00b0 Institute for Global Health, is now a semifinalist for a 100&Change grant worth $100 million from MacArthur. The grant funds a single proposal that would help \u201cin solving a critical problem of our time,\u201d as the MacArthur website puts it. Dr. Richards-Kortum would use the proceeds to address the newborn death rates in sub-Saharan Africa, which accounts for 38% of global neonatal deaths. In 2015, while the infant-mortality rate in the U.S. was 3.6 deaths per 1,000 births, the rate in sub-Saharan Africa was 28.6. Her ultimate goal: to halve the rate of infant mortality in that region within the next decade.So she and her team at Rice have developed a number of low-cost ways to keep babies warm, help them breathe and diagnose and treat various conditions. A device that can identify jaundice with an inexpensive blood test is being tried out in Malawi, as is a syringe pump to deliver liquid medications to newborns and to women giving birth.The Rice team has also developed a continuous positive airway pressure machine to improve airflow into children\u2019s lungs. It is selling for $800 apiece; similar machines in developed countries cost $6,000, Dr. Richards-Kortum says. In one hospital in Tanzania, the use of the machine, combined with staff training, increased the survival rate of babies with respiratory distress to 71% compared with 44% for those treated with nasal oxygen. The machine is now being used in 26 countries.Dr. Richards-Kortum grew up in the Corn Belt city of Grand Island, Neb. As a child, she loved reading science fiction and mystery books and wanted to be a fiction writer. Then, in high school, she discovered math and science. She went on to the University of Nebraska and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where she earned graduate degrees in physics and medical physics.Since 2005, Dr. Richards-Kortum has been at Rice. One of her jobs is to help students come up with new treatment ideas in developing countries. On the checklist: Does the problem affect a lot of people? Are there willing local-clinic collaborators? And does the idea fit within the 360\u00b0 Institute\u2019s area of technical expertise: namely, imaging and diagnostic tests that can be conducted in one visit?Dr. Richards-Kortum lives in Houston with her husband, Philip Kortum, a Rice professor of psychology, and three children (three others have already left the nest). Her two youngest were adopted from Ethiopia. \u201cEvery time I would go [to Africa], I would end up visiting an orphanage and seeing an orphan in the hospital,\u201d she says. When her youngest biological child reached 18, she recalls, \u201cI said to my husband, \u2018I think we have more room at the table.\u2019 \u201d However, \u201cit took a while to convince him,\u201d she adds with a laugh.The scientist says that she \u201cstays sane\u201d by running, whether in the U.S. or Africa, though she often gets lost without GPS in areas without cell service. Lost in an African neighborhood recently, she kept running until she found an area with reception. Then she called a co-worker, who drove around honking the horn so that Dr. Richards-Kortum could listen for the car and guide her colleague to her.Last month, Dr. Richards-Kortum traveled to Nigeria and Tanzania to get feedback on her medical tools. Such trips make her realize how \u201ctruly blessed\u201d Americans are to have access to modern medical technology. At a newborn intensive-care unit, a nurse was carrying a stack of death certificates. During her visit of just a few hours, two babies died.\u201cEvery time I go and visit a place like that,\u201d she says, \u201cI come back feeling just that much more committed trying to change that situation.\u201dCorrections & Amplifications   Dr. Richards-Kortum is a professor in Rice University\u2019s bioengineering department, and her husband is a professor of psychology there.

President       George W. Bush       broke down barriers by championing a 2008 landmark nuclear agreement with New Delhi. President       Barack Obama       called the U.S.-India relationship \u201cone of the defining partnerships of the 21st century\u201d and strategic and defense cooperation between the countries grew under him, fueled by a shared wariness of China.Mr. Trump, in a post-inauguration phone call with Mr. Modi in January, called India a \u201ctrue friend,\u201d the White House said at the time. He sees India as a critical partner for stability and economic growth in the Asia-Pacific region, which is being reshaped by China\u2019s rise, the White House official said.Indian officials said the meeting would be an opportunity for the leaders to get to know each other. Both have promised economic programs rooted in increasing manufacturing in their countries, and have ridden waves of nationalistic sentiment to shake up politics at home.\u201cA lot depends on what sort of rapport they strike,\u201d said Harsh Pant, head of strategic studies at New Delhi-based think tank Observer Research Foundation. \u201cIf they don\u2019t [develop an understanding], irritants that were pushed aside in recent years could just as easily resurface and overwhelm the relationship.\u201dAs a presidential candidate, Mr. Trump assailed the skilled-worker visa program used by hundreds of thousands of Indians employed in the U.S. In office, he has ordered a review, saying the so-called H-1B visas should only be granted to the \u201cmost-skilled and the highest-paid\u201d applicants to avoid crowding out American workers.Indian Foreign Secretary Subrahmanyam Jaishankar in March said H-1B visas help the U.S. economy to be more competitive and that India had conveyed its views on the subject to the Trump administration.The White House official said there was no plan to discuss the visas during Mr. Modi\u2019s visit, but that issues relating to climate change may arise. Mr. Modi backs the Paris climate agreement Mr. Trump is withdrawing from. Earlier this month, Mr. Trump said India made its participation in the deal contingent on receiving billions of dollars from developed nations, something New Delhi refuted.U.S. Trade Representative       Robert Lighthizer       said Wednesday that officials were working with Indian counterparts to address U.S. concerns about India\u2019s intellectual property standards and barriers to foreign direct investment.\u201cWe\u2019re hoping that we end up with deliverables,\u201d he told the Senate Finance Committee.Monday\u2019s talks will have a particular focus on regional security and defense collaboration, Indian officials said. These were engines of growth under Mr. Obama as New Delhi emerged as a leading buyer of U.S. arms, and China began altering the balance of power in Asia. Although India remains opposed to a formal security alliance with the U.S., Mr. Modi, who built a personal rapport with Mr. Obama, embraced Washington more than Indian leaders before him.Trump administration officials said they support this burgeoning partnership. \u201cThe U.S. is interested in leaning forward in providing high technology, the kind of technology that the U.S. provides to its closest allies and partners,\u201d the White House official said.The U.S. is working on a plan to approve India\u2019s purchase of unarmed MQ-9 maritime surveillance drones for the visit, people familiar with the matter said. India has sought the equipment, which is made by General Atomics Aeronautical Systems Inc., for use by its Navy.Among other deals up for discussion is             Lockheed Martin Corp.\u2019s       proposal to move its F-16 aircraft production line to India as part of Mr. Modi\u2019s \u201cMake in India\u201d program if it wins a contract to supply the jet fighters to India\u2019s air force.Lockheed\u2019s U.S. line is switching over to building more-advanced F-35 aircraft. A Lockheed official said the company has briefed the Trump administration on its proposals.\u201cF-16 production in India supports thousands of Lockheed Martin and F-16 supplier jobs in the U.S. and creates new jobs and other opportunities in India,\u201d the official said. The aircraft faces competition from Swedish defense company             Saab                   AB.Increasing collaboration on energy projects in India is also expected to be on the agenda.Mr. Trump is no stranger to India. The Trump Organization has brand-licensing deals involving Indian real-estate development projects.\u201cI don\u2019t know what he\u2019s going to do with India,\u201d said Rep.       Sander Levin,        a Michigan Democrat on the House committee that oversees trade. \u201cI do say his investments cast a cloud over anything he does on trade.\u201dThe White House didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.Mr. Trump has said his companies wouldn\u2019t do new business deals overseas while he is president. He has handed operations of his business assets to his sons and another executive and said he wouldn\u2019t be involved in them, though he still receives the financial benefit of these arrangements.Mr. Modi\u2019s visit comes amid concerns that an inward-looking U.S. is retreating from its global leadership role, ceding space to China. India wants to forestall a unipolar Asia, as it faces territorial disputes with Beijing, China\u2019s growing footprint in the Indian Ocean and its support for India\u2019s rival neighbor Pakistan.India will look to enlist Mr. Trump in its international campaign to put pressure on Pakistan to stop using what New Delhi calls terrorist proxies or allow terrorists to use its soil to attack India, an Indian official said. Pakistan denies it supports anti-India terrorists.\u201cThere are big questions over Trump\u2019s strategic vision for Asia,\u201d said Mr. Pant. \u201cThe future of U.S.-India ties rests on how the answers evolve.\u201d\u2014Paul Sonne in Washington contributed to this article.Write to Niharika Mandhana at niharika.mandhana@wsj.com, Michael C.

As a child, she begged her parents to balance on a log instead of a gymnast beam.At age 10 she was taking log rolling lessons, and by 17 she turned pro. Now 44, she\u2019s a three-time log rolling world champion. She\u2019s won another three world titles in boom running, an offshoot of log rolling where two contestants race across floating logs. Ms. Atkinson is considered a veteran lumberjill, double the age of most of her competition. She believes she would have been in close contention for a few more titles had she not been diagnosed with breast cancer in 2009, eight months after giving birth to her son. She competed throughout treatment and is now cancer-free. \u201cI plan to be log rolling into my 80s,\u201d she says.Ms. Atkinson teaches elementary school in Stillwater, which allows her summers off to compete. The U.S. Log Rolling Association\u2019s professional circuit kicked off June 10 and includes six stops, culminating July 20 to 22 at the Lumberjack World Championships in Hayward, Wis. These days, Ms. Atkinson only competes in log rolling. She trains year round.A log rolling match consists of two people running on the same log at the same time with the objective of outlasting one\u2019s opponent. Whoever\u2019s foot is on the log last wins the fall, the term used for scoring. A match is best three out of five. Women typically start competitions on a 12-foot-long, 14-inch-wide log, and the match progresses onto smaller logs, which sink lower and spin faster. Some matches can last for 30 minutes.\u201cThe sport encompasses all things athletic,\u201d Ms. Atkinson says. \u201cIt\u2019s an aerobic and anaerobic workout utilizing strength, power, agility, balance and endurance.\u201dMs. Atkinson is ranked ninth in the U.S. Log Rolling Association\u2019s elite rankings. She says a podium spot is always the goal, but her motivation these days is to be a role model for newcomers to the sport and her 8-year-old son, Bear, who started log rolling last summer. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing this over 30 years and I still smile every time I step on a log,\u201d she says.During the summer season Ms. Atkinson log rolls for one to two hours, five days a week with other elite-level log rollers or up-and-coming teenagers, usually men. \u201cIf I\u2019m on a log alone, I can stay on all day,\u201d she says. \u201cA second person\u2019s weight and movements contradict what you do and challenge you. It\u2019s the only way to reach the next level.\u201dMs. Atkinson has a cabin with a man-made pond stocked with various types of logs and booms for training. She often does intervals on her logs. \u201cIn competition you have spurts of really fast rolling where your heart rate spikes,\u201d she says. \u201cYou need to be able to calm down after those spurts so you can anticipate your opponent\u2019s next move.\u201dShe complements her training with cycling, weightlifting and yoga. In the off-season, she takes a break and stays fit with alpine and Nordic skiing and plays forward on a hockey team.Ms. Atkinson\u2019s diet focuses on fruits, vegetables, lean protein and complex carbohydrates. \u201cAfter a tournament or hard workout I just listen to what my body craves,\u201d she says. In the morning she often has eggs, an English Muffin topped with peanut butter and homemade jam and tea. A favorite dinner is chicken alfredo with salad. Ms. Atkinson drinks water with lemon throughout the day.With help from sponsors, Ms. Atkinson trains on two full booms. One is 14 logs long, the other nine, and a Key Log, a 65-pound synthetic log ($2,150) that fills with water. \u201cLogs are typically 400 to 500 pounds, which has really held our sport back,\u201d Ms. Atkinson says. \u201cThe Key Log is easy to transport, like a kayak, and has made log rolling much more accessible.\u201d She often trains in soft-soled shoes, like Tevas.\u201cLog rolling is a social sport and I like to practice with music in the background, usually U2 or anything from the \u201880s.\u201dLog rolling might seem like a quirky regional hobby, but according to a 2015 study by the American Council on Exercise, running on a log can actually deliver a great workout.Shana Verstegen, a six-time world-champion log roller and boom runner and personal trainer based in Madison, Wis., says aspects of every pillar of fitness\u2014strength, coordination, balance, aerobic and aerobic conditioning, and mobility\u2014are called into play during log rolling.\u201cA log rolling match can be likened to an interval run,\u201d she says. To be able to move your feet very fast on a piece of wood that is only 12 to 14 inches in diameter and keep your body centered and controlled takes extreme coordination and body awareness, she says.Ms. Verstegen says the ability to move well in the hips and shoulders is key for some of the quick, long strides and far reaches need to control balance. \u201cThrow in the need for absolute concentration and patience and you have yourself one of the most challenging workouts around,\u201d she says.Write to Jen Murphy at workout@wsj.comExercise on Vacation: Essential or Pure Evil?A family holiday often means bad food and slothful habits.

In a statement, SeaWorld said it \u201chas cooperated with these government inquiries and intends to continue to cooperate with any government requests or inquiries.\u201dSeaWorld didn\u2019t disclose Friday the nature of the trading being probed or specific statements made by executives. The Justice Department probe is targeting statements made on or before August 2014, the company said.Shares of SeaWorld declined 2.4% to $15.28 in after-hours trading Friday. The stock had slid 17% so far this year through Friday\u2019s close.The theme-park operator has navigated turbulent waters in recent years, following the release of \u201cBlackfish,\u201d the 2013 documentary that claims orcas, also known as killer whales, suffer in captivity, and the December 2014 ouster of its chief executive as the company launched a restructuring plan.SeaWorld also said Friday board chairman       David D\u2019Alessandro       will step down Dec. 31 after he failed to secure enough votes at a shareholder meeting earlier in June.Blackstone Group        BX 0.78%       LP bought SeaWorld from             Anheuser-Busch InBev                   NV for $2.3 billion in 2009 and slowly pared down its once-controlling stake in the company in the years following SeaWorld\u2019s 2013 initial public offering.

The detention of the couple last year closed a rare window on social unrest in China by putting a key provider of such data out of commission.Mr. Lu\u2019s one-day trial in the southwestern city of Dali concluded at 9 p.m. on Friday, with prosecutors recommending he be sentenced to between three and five years in prison, one of Mr. Lu\u2019s lawyers,       Xiao Yunyang,        told The Wall Street Journal.Prosecutors accused Mr. Lu of spreading rumors. The court is likely to find Mr. Lu guilty and accept the prosecutors\u2019 suggestion despite the activist maintaining his innocence in court, Mr. Xiao said.\u201cThe events he wrote about were all real, none of it was fake. He insisted he wasn\u2019t guilty,\u201d the lawyer said.\u201cPicking quarrels\u201d is a vague legal term that authorities have used to prosecute dozens of activists and political dissidents since Chinese President       Xi Jinping       came to power in late 2012. Many of the accused have been released on China\u2019s equivalent of bail after confessing. Nearly all who declined to confess have been convicted and sentenced to prison.Calls to the Dali prosecutors\u2019 office rang unanswered on Saturday.\u2018Lu Yuyu\u2019s work served as a weather vane on social stability in China.\u2019The government tracks the number of so-called \u201cmass incidents,\u201d but no longer publicizes it. China\u2019s labor ministry discloses regular tallies on labor arbitration and mediation cases, but labor groups and other activists largely relied on Mr. Lu to provide them with the broad picture.Chinese authorities have struggled with how to address workers\u2019 frustration with unpaid wages and the prospect of layoffs\u00a0in a slowing economy. In May, China\u2019s labor ministry announced overhauls of its workplace-dispute resolution regime that will take effect in July, as labor arbitration and mediation courts struggle to deal with a rise in cases.Labor activists meanwhile have faced greater pressure. In September, a Chinese court handed suspended jail sentences to three labor activists detained in a 2015 sweep after they pleaded guilty to disrupting public order. In May, three activists were detained as they investigated a factory that had made shoes for the Ivanka Trump brand.A harsh sentence for Mr. Lu would send a signal to activists and labor groups that the Communist Party doesn\u2019t intend to allow independent advocacy or monitoring of workers\u2019 rights. Mr. Xiao, the lawyer, said it wasn\u2019t clear when the court would hand down its decision.\u201cLu Yuyu\u2019s work served as a weather vane on social stability in China,\u201d said       Wu Qiang,        a former Tsinghua University politics lecturer, who studies social movements. \u201cIn targeting him, the authorities are trying to shut this window into social trends and send a signal to the activist community.\u201dJournalist advocate group Reporters Without Borders and French television station TV5 Monde jointly awarded Mr. Lu and his girlfriend,       Li Tingyu,        a press-freedom prize in November, saying they were \u201cpaying a high price for their commitment to freely and independently reported information in China.\u201dBorn in 1979 in the southern province of Guizhou, Mr. Lu dropped out from university and worked a series of odd jobs before moving to Shanghai in 2009. He started documenting public protests in 2012 by tracking posts on Chinese social-media platform Weibo as well as photos and videos of unrest, his acquaintances say.Mr. Lu eventually made trawling the internet for information about public protests across China a full-time commitment, relying on donations from friends and acquaintances for living expenses. Many know Mr. Lu only by his web moniker, \u201cwickedonna,\u201d and through his blog, \u201cNon News.\u201d Acquaintances describe him as a \u201clone wolf.\u201d Few have ever met Mr. Lu, who carved out a nomadic existence to elude authorities as he published his findings online.In 2013, Mr. Lu was joined by Ms. Li, a university student who later became his girlfriend and sole partner, their acquaintances say. In a blog post published by Ms. Li in July 2013, Mr. Lu said his work \u201cprobably increased the exposure given to grassroots-level protests.\u201d\u201cThe Weibo users who publish original posts about these incidents have very few followers,\u201d Mr. Lu said. \u201cIf I don\u2019t search for them, they either get censored or will never see the light of day.\u201dIn June 2016, authorities detained Mr. Lu and Ms. Li in Dali, a tourist hot spot in Yunnan province, where they had been living since 2014. A couple of days passed before their friends recognized the silence of the pair\u2019s social-media accounts as a sign of trouble.Ms. Li was tried in April and later released without a verdict, according to human-rights group China Human Rights Defenders.Efforts to reach Mr. Lu\u2019s relatives weren\u2019t successful.

The problem is few of them are for sale or even being built.The centerpiece of Fiat Chrysler\u2019s efforts is the new 84-miles-per-gallon hybrid gas-electric Pacifica minivan.\u00a0But for many potential customers, the vehicle has been as hard to find as the flying pigs, blue moons and two-headed dogs featured in ads for the industry\u2019s first hybrid minivan.The auto maker,\u00a0which created the minivan segment in the 1980s, has suspended production of Pacifica hybrids in recent weeks amid a planned recall of the vehicle due to technical glitches, people familiar with the matter said.\u00a0Fiat Chrysler hasn't disclosed the suspension publicly.The delay has irked buyers, who have high hopes for the well-regarded vehicle. Among them is Google\u2019s parent company\u2014the single biggest buyer so far\u2014whose engineers use it to test self-driving systems.The flawed product rollout is a \u201cblack eye,\u201d said       Bill Bernard,        general manager of Chrysler dealership in Fredonia, N.Y. \u201cChrysler does a very poor job of launching new products.\u201dThe setback comes as the company stockpiles the \u201cEcoDiesel\u201d versions of its 2017 Ram pickup trucks and Jeep Grand Cherokee SUVs after the government alleged the company used illegal emissions software, a move that has delayed regulatory certification by months.The glitches cast doubt on the company\u2019s ability to boost its fuel-economy ranking, the second worse after Porsche among global auto makers. It also raises questions about its readiness to meet increasingly stringent emissions standards hitting the American auto industry in coming years.Fiat Chrysler sees the issues as temporary setbacks, and officials say Pacifica hybrid production will resume in time to meet outstanding orders. The EcoDiesels, it says, will be certified by regulators once their concerns are addressed.The company\u2019s lineup now emphasizes horsepower over green as it boosts production of higher profit margin SUVs and pickup trucks. It says current consumer demand for fully electric vehicles doesn\u2019t now warrant greater production and marketing of such autos.Prior to releasing Ecodiesels and\u00a0the\u00a0hybrid\u00a0minivan, the auto maker\u2019s most visible fuel-efficiency play was the Fiat 500e. However, the pricey city car is available in\u00a0only two\u00a0states and the company loses money on each sale.The hybrid Pacifica, built in Windsor, Ontario, made its debut earlier this year but has been plagued by launch delays, including the major recall\u00a0this month\u00a0for a defect that could potentially shut down engines on\u00a0the nearly\u00a02,000 models sold so far.\u201cThe most information I can get is that it is being audited for safety,\u201d said       David Pittman       of Silver Spring, Md., who ordered a hybrid Pacifica in April and is waiting for it to be delivered.The growing backlog of such buyers could weigh on the company\u2019s reputation and bottom line. Fiat Chrysler has handed out $500 pre-paid credit cards or high-speed electric chargers to compensate. Some of its dealers have also lent vehicles to owners who have received the car, as they await the recall to be fixed.Fiat Chrysler hasn\u2019t said when the flaw would be fixed or when production would resume. In a letter to dealers, viewed by The Wall Street Journal, Fiat Chrysler said a sudden loss of power from defective inverter diodes \u201ccould cause a crash without a warning.\u201d\u00a0A recall isn\u2019t expected to begin, however, until the third quarter.\u201cIt\u2019s been radio silence,\u201d said       Chris Filkins,        40 years old, who lives outside of Buffalo, N.Y. and awaits a Pacifica hybrid he ordered in\u00a0March. \u201cIf you have a lease coming due or your car is about to die, I wouldn\u2019t put your eggs in this basket.\u201dA Fiat Chrysler spokesman said the company is required to stop sales of current production vehicles subject to a recall, and that it is following a \u201cregulated process for communicating recalls to customers.\u201dAmong those taking notice was             Alphabet Inc.\u2019s        GOOGL 0.59%       Google car team, which is now named Waymo.\u00a0The Pacifica hybrid is spacious and runs on a high-powered battery with a backup gasoline engine if juice runs out\u2014a combination Google sees as ideal for autonomous-vehicle testing.The Silicon Valley tech giant has about 100 hybrid Pacificas in its fleet and has ordered 500 more.\u00a0Neither Waymo or Fiat Chrysler would say if any of those additional vehicles have been delivered.Dealers are also in a jam.\u201cI need about 20 of them,\u201d said       Brad Davis,        vice president of Glenn E. Thomas Dodge Chrysler Jeep near Long Beach, Calif. \u201cWe sold the only four we received the day they arrived,\u201d he said. The dealership said has a waiting list of more than 30 prospects for the van.The hybrid problem follows Fiat Chrysler\u2019s delayed push into diesels, a technology that is more efficient than gasoline but under scrutiny following             Volkswagen AG\u2019s       emissions-cheating scandal in 2015.The Environmental Protection Agency alleges that Fiat Chrysler may have sought to undermine emissions tests on its diesel versions of the Ram pickup and Jeep Grand Cherokee.

This week the group released its second university rankings, which aim to measure just how well the most elite schools in the nation are faring in that regard.The organization says its members come from across the political spectrum. The largest group (25%) consider themselves moderates, according to an internal poll of their members posted on their website.Harvard University, which has repeatedly been in the crosshairs of free-speech advocates, was 103rd out of 106 schools in the Heterodox ranking.Heterodox, which weighs schools\u2019 regulations as well as the ratings of other first-amendment groups, cited Harvard\u2019s history of censoring outside speakers, a blacklist on private clubs, fraternities and sororities, and a laminated \u201csocial justice\u201d place mat handed out to students before winter break in 2015. The aim of the place mat was to help students prepare \u201cfor holiday discussions on race and justice with loved ones.\u201dStriking the balance between protecting both students and the First Amendment isn\u2019t easy, said Ari Cohn, a director at the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education. He called it \u201cadvanced citizenship.\u201dBut he also condemned university leaders for \u201cwanting to have their cake and eat it too.\u201d He pointed to the commencement address delivered by Harvard President       Drew Gilpin Faust       in May.\u201cIf some words are to be treated as equivalent to physical violence and silenced or even prosecuted, who is to decide which words?\u201d she said.A week later, Mr. Cohn said, the answer became clear: Harvard would decide.The school rescinded admission offers for at least 10 incoming freshmen after they discovered the students had posted offensive messages in a private             Facebook                   chat.\u201cThat\u2019s rank hypocrisy,\u201d Mr. Cohn said. \u201cAnd sort of ridiculous.\u201dA Harvard spokeswoman declined to comment on the ranking. She cited a section of Harvard\u2019s admission policy stating an offer can be rescinded if a student \u201cengages or has engaged in behavior that brings into question their honesty, maturity or moral character.\u201dThe new initiative at Johns Hopkins, an institute funded by the Stavros Niarchos Foundation, hopes to\u00a0\u201cexamine the dynamics of societal, cultural and political polarization and develop ways to improve decision-making and civic discourse,\u201d according to a statement released by the school. The Stavros Niarchos Foundation is a philanthropic organization created to honor the Greek shipping magnate of the same name.Heterodox ranks Johns Hopkins 60 out 106 schools and cites a study finding that among 40 leading U.S. universities, the Baltimore school\u2019s faculty was among the least diverse in terms of voter registration.A spokesman for the school declined to comment.The Heterodox ranking lists Berkeley as 105 out of 106 schools, citing the protests that stopped Mr. Yiannopoulos and Ms. Coulter from speaking as well as a missive from the University of California system urging faculty \u201cnot to criticize affirmative action or to refer to America as a melting pot.\u201dOn Tuesday\u00a0at a Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator Chuck Grassley (R., Iowa) criticized Berkeley for failing to adequately punish violent protesters.\u201cHigher education rests on the free flow of ideas,\u201d he said.A Berkeley spokesman said a misperception has taken root about the school\u2019s tolerance for conservative viewpoints.\u201cWe would resist the notion that this campus has been anything other than welcoming to speakers from across the political spectrum,\u201d spokesman Dan Mogulof said.The Heterodox Academy put Yale University 97th\u00a0out of 106. The ranking noted in 2016 it had earned both the Jefferson Muzzle Award for censorship by students and the Harvey Silvergate Muzzle Award for students demanding the resignation of professors over an email.One of those professors was Nicholas\u00a0Christakis, who was condemned by a group of students in 2015 after he and his wife\u2014who were then faculty-in-residence at one of Yale\u2019s undergraduate colleges\u2014sent a letter telling students it was up to them, and not Yale administrators, to decide what Halloween costumes they wanted to wear.Dr. Christakis is now a member of the Heterodox Academy. He pointed out that most of the schools in the Ivy league fared poorly in the ranking. He called the cultural homogeneity on college campuses a disservice to students.Karen N. Peart, director of external communications at Yale, said in an email, \u201cYale\u2019s commitment to free expression is unsurpassed in higher education.\u201dThe top-ranked school is the University of Chicago. Provost       Daniel Diermeier       said the ideal of viewpoint diversity is central to the university\u2019s mission.\u201cWe believe that the best education we can provide students to prepare them for the world is to hear diverse points of view even if they feel uncomfortable,\u201d Dr. Diermeier said. \u201cWe want to provide them with the tools to find counterarguments.Write to Douglas Belkin at doug.belkin@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-24 08:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/colleges-promise-to-be-less-politically-correct-1498305600", "news_title": "Colleges Pledge Tolerance for Diverse Opinions, But Skeptics Remain", "keywords": "campus politics,conservative movement,first amendment,free speech,higher education,liberal professors,political correctness,political debate,protests,Johns Hopkins University,University of California Berkeley,political,general news,education,university,college"}, {"content": "ISLAMABAD, Pakistan\u2014The death toll from multiple terror attacks across Pakistan on Friday rose to 72 on Saturday, officials said, making it one of the deadliest days in the country so far this year and prompting the government to ramp up security and counterterrorism operations.The number of people killed in three separate attacks in different parts of the country was the highest since February, when 88 perished in a suicide bombing at a Sufi Islamic shrine.The Friday attacks came as people across Muslim-majority Pakistan prepared to celebrate the Eid festival next week that marks the end of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan.\u201cThe purpose of terrorist attacks two days before Eid is to spread uncertainty and chaos, but such cowardly acts can\u2019t harm the nation\u2019s resolve,\u201d Interior Minister Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan said Saturday, and promised to respond with \u201cfull force.\u201dIn the first incident, in the southwestern city of Quetta, a suicide bomber detonated a bomb when his vehicle was stopped by policemen at a checkpoint near the provincial police chief\u2019s office, killing 13 and wounding more than a dozen. The bombing was claimed by Islamic State\u2019s Khorasan chapter, which operates in Afghanistan and Pakistan. A faction of the Pakistani Taliban also separately claimed the bombing.Later on Friday, in the northwestern town of Parachinar near the border with Afghanistan, two bombs tore through a crowded market, killing at least 55 people and injuring hundreds. The attack was claimed in text messages to local journalists by an unnamed spokesman of Lashkar-e-Jhangvi al Alami, a rabidly sectarian Sunni Islamist militant group with links to international groups including al Qaeda.In the third attack late Friday, gunmen shot four policemen dead in Karachi, Pakistan\u2019s largest city.The number of terrorist attacks in Pakistan has declined sharply after the government launched large-scale military operations against groups including the Pakistani Taliban in 2014.

But unless we\u2019re at a rock concert getting our rib cages rattled by the percussion, most of us generally associate listening with the delicate mechanisms in our ears. By the same token, rarely do we engage with a statue or painting with more than our eyes. A bold and engaging show at the Rubin Museum of Art gives us the chance to broaden our understanding and experience of art.The World Is SoundRubin Museum of Art  Through Jan. 8, 2018The museum\u2019s spiral staircase serves as prelude to \u201cThe World Is Sound,\u201d which fills the sixth floor. From a concave disk at the base emanates an orchestration of man-made and natural sounds by       Laetitia Sonami       and       Bob Bielecki.       As we ascend, this interacts with a succession of tracks from Eliane Radigue\u2019s well-known \u201cLabyrinthe Sonore.\u201d Together, they form \u201cLe Corps Sonore\u201d or \u201cSound Body,\u201d which washes over us in waves and, with the persistent gentleness of mist, fills our minds. (If you opt for the elevator, you might stop at each floor and pause by the railing.) By the time we reach the top, Rubin curator Risha Lee\u2019s wall text exhorting us to \u201clisten with your whole body\u201d makes sense.So what has this to do with Himalayan art, the Rubin\u2019s stock-in-trade? The answer is just about everything. Whether the painting of a bodhisattva or the statue of a wrathful deity, most objects in the museum\u2019s collection serve as aids in a religious practice that involves hearing (bells, horns, mantras), smelling (incense, burning ghee), touch (ritual objects). The underlying premise is that it is through all our senses\u2014Hindu and Buddhist scriptures include the mind as a sixth\u2014that we perceive reality. While most shows at the Rubin focus on the visual, this one underscores sound, which by its very nature embodies Buddhist tenets of impermanence and change.Ms. Lee has created a compelling combination of recorded Tibetan rituals, objects from the collection, and contemporary audio and video installations that respond to fundamental themes of creation, infinity, interconnectedness, death. Not coincidentally, many of the contemporary artists appear to take a Buddhist approach to life and spirituality.In one room, we are immersed in a vocal drone using the Rubin\u2019s recording of 10,000 visitors uttering Om or Aum, a powerful Sanskrit \u201cseed syllable\u201d variously believed to contain all forces at work in the universe and to symbolize the union of body, speech and mind. The sound envelops us, its strands weaving an ever-changing fabric. Elsewhere, we step up to, say, a statue or painting and experience it as part of a ritual that includes a chant or mantra. We stand before a display of instruments listening to their voices work together. We recline and hear instructions on how to navigate what Tibetan Buddhists believe are stages, or bardos, we journey through after death. The text is a translation from the \u201cTibetan Book of the Dead,\u201d and its words follow us as we contemplate depictions of colors and deities the deceased encounter.In a few instances, displays bring in yet a third sense. Looking at a small, 19th-century mandala, for example, we listen to a monk and, placing our palm on the wall, feel the vibrations of his voice as our eyes take in red and yellow geometrics and the deity at their center.The Rubin\u2019s head of exhibition design, John Monaco, and his team deserve kudos for orchestrating a show whose principal medium is air. Only occasionally do they resort to headphones; mostly they use curved partitions lined with acoustic panels to create eddies of sound. On one visit, this worked perfectly; on another, the volume was sometimes poorly calibrated, probably to account for visitors\u2019 voices. It may be impossible to achieve perfection, so a word of advice: Go at quiet times or, if there\u2019s too much competing noise, wait it out in one of the other shows. Any sound spilling from the stairwell\u2019s installation will only add to that experience.When I ducked into the fourth-floor Shrine Room, the deep-throated chants of monks interacted with the subtleties of \u201cLe Corps Sonore,\u201d together creating forms as physical as the rows of gleaming statuary filling the altar.\u2014Ms. Lawrence writes about Asian and Islamic art for the Journal.Correction: An earlier version of this story misspelled the name of an artist who created \u201cLabyrinthe Sonore.\u201dAppeared in the June 26, 2017, print edition as 'Come to See the Sound.'", "news_time": "2017-06-24 07:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-world-is-sound-review-listening-to-reality-1498302001", "news_title": "\u2018The World Is Sound\u2019 Review: Listening to Reality", "keywords": "arts in review, buddhism, exhibition, mantra, music, rubin museum of art,the world is sound,art,political,general news,arts,entertainment,music,reviews"}, {"content": "Eighteen months ago, the Rice family was pressured to sell shares in their family gas company at all-time-low prices as the natural gas market tanked.Now the Rice family is selling again. But this time, it is the entire company, and under much more favorable circumstances.On Monday, rival Appalachian gas producer             EQT Corp.        EQT 2.24%       said it would buy             Rice Energy Inc.        RICE 1.63%for $6.7 billion in a deal that is poised to deliver more than $1 billion to the family, whose members make up much of Rice\u2019s management and control roughly 18% of the company\u2019s shares, according to securities filings.The merger, which will create one of country\u2019s largest natural gas producers, shows how the shale boom continues to mint great fortunes even after the bounty of oil and gas around the world depressed energy prices.With gas in particular, timing is everything. Prices for the fuel, which is used in heating and to generate electricity, is prone to wild swings as unpredictable as the weather.In late 2015, the warmest winter on record pulled down gas futures to all-time, inflation-adjusted lows, dragging down Rice\u2019s stock. To avoid a margin call, the family sold a slug of shares they had borrowed against. Had they been able to hang on to those five million shares, the family would now be nearly $100 million richer.Under terms of the EQT deal, Rice shareholders are due $5.30 in cash and about one-third of an EQT share. Based on EQT\u2019s closing stock price the day before the deal was announced, that equates to about $27.05 for every Rice share.Still, the family is likely one of the gas boom\u2019s biggest winners just a decade after       Daniel Rice III       and his sons created the company from scratch. Their expertise in oil and coal helped them scout land in the early days of the shale-gas boom in Pennsylvania.Mr. Rice honed his expertise at             BlackRock Inc.,       where he was a mutual-fund manager specializing in energy when his family started the gas company. One early move was a deal to drill in areas controlled by a coal company that Mr. Rice\u2019s BlackRock fund invested in.After the arrangement was brought to light by The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Rice resigned. Rice executives declined to comment and Mr. Rice, who is now a Rice board member and a portfolio manager for Boston money manager GRT Capital Partners LLC., didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\u201cWhile there were no actual conflicts of interest, BlackRock and I both understand the desire to avoid even the appearance of one,\u201d he said at the time.Although Mr. Rice played a large role in funding and founding the company, he largely left management to three of his sons, who are in their 30s.       Daniel Rice IV       is its chief executive.       Toby       is operations chief, and       Derek       is executive vice president of exploration.Their younger brother       Ryan       works there as a petroleum engineer, according to the company\u2019s proxy. Toby\u2019s wife,       Aileen,        is vice president of land.Toby was the first to move to Pittsburgh while he was still in his 20s. He started the company from a downtown apartment working with a former classmate from Texas A&M University who was an early partner. They sandwiched data-mining sessions and trips to scout oil and gas deeds at local courthouses between rounds of beer and the videogame \u201cCall of Duty,\u201d according to people familiar with the early days of the company.One early success came from the deal with coal miner             Alpha Natural Resources Inc.       Then expansion into Ohio accelerated the company\u2019s growth. Drilling rights it scooped up there turned out to be in the heart of the Utica Shale, another gas-rich formation under the more popular Marcellus.The company did an initial public offering in 2014, debuting with a 4% gain over its IPO price of $21 a share. The family owned a third of the company\u2019s shares at the time, and the offering valued them at $900 million. Those shares ran up another 50% in gains by that summer when Rice announced a historic find.It drilled a Utica well called Bigfoot 9H that by one measure ranks among the most successful in U.S. history. It hit an initial production of 41.7 million cubic feet a day, enough to power every home in Pittsburgh for 36 hours.The brothers commemorated many of the company\u2019s big wells and landmarks with custom-made championship belts from the same craftsman who makes belts for             World Wrestling Entertainment Inc.The Rice brothers developed a reputation as colorful characters even in an oil and gas business known for eccentrics. They have used wrestler Hulk Hogan\u2019s theme song as hold music at the company\u2019s headquarters, and named the company\u2019s wells after monster trucks and comic book characters, including Captain Planet and Gold Digger.The company included on news releases a disclaimer: \u201cDespite their size and strength, our wells are in no manner affiliated with such superheroes or monster trucks.\u201dWhen coal miner Alpha Natural filed for bankruptcy protection and sold some assets at an auction, the Rice brothers showed up wearing Mickey Mouse T-shirts and shorts underneath blazers. It was a classic example of how the brothers challenged an often-staid industry, said       Kevin Crutchfield,        former chief executive at Alpha Natural.\u201cIt was a very millennial outfit,\u201d he said. \u201cThey worked, when needed, insanely hard, but they were also very playful.\u201dWrite to Ryan Dezember at ryan.dezember@wsj.com and Timothy Puko at tim.puko@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-24 07:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-the-rice-brothers-survived-the-gas-bust-to-make-family-a-billion-1498302002", "news_title": "How Four Brothers Survived the Gas Bust to Make Family a Billion ", "keywords": " acquisition, deal,margin call, merger, natural gas,rice energy,EQT,Rice Energy,RICE,Daniel Rice III,Daniel Rice IV,Toby,Derek,Ryan,Aileen,ownership changes,acquisitions,mergers,divestments,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,commodity markets,agricultural commodity markets,commodity,financial market news,grain markets,grains,edible oils markets,rice markets,energy,crude oil,natural gas upstream operations,natural gas,oil exploration"}, {"content": "LOS ANGELES\u2014Record-breaking temperatures across the Southwest are turning up the heat for firefighters battling massive flares, hampering their efforts and presenting a new layer of danger for workers on the fire lines.Around 200 miles east of Phoenix, where temperatures ranged from 112 to 119 degrees Fahrenheit in the past week, more than 800 firefighters fought the 21,000-acre Frye Fire descending Mount Graham.Crews working the fire line can only work up to 30 minutes to an hour at a time before they are forced to retreat to cool off, said       Brian Oliver,        a safety officer for an interagency coalition at Mount Graham.If they don\u2019t take frequent breaks, crew members risk heat exhaustion or heat stroke.

The burned homes were among the 400 homes near the ski town of       Brian Head,        which was evacuated on Thursday, according to state officials. There have been no reported injuries.In Arizona, there were 15 active wildfires as of Friday morning, each of which had burned about 1,000 acres or more, according to federal fire-tracking data.Arizona Gov.       Doug Ducey       on Friday declared a state of emergency as wildfires continue to spread in the high temperatures, and authorized $200,000 in emergency funds.New Mexico has reported 11 wildfires, the largest of which burned 17,000 acres so far. And Nevada has reported seven wildfires, the largest of which burned over 15,000 acres.California has already seen 1,800 fires that burned nearly 20,000 acres since Jan. 1, about three times more acreage burned compared with the same time last year. Parts of the state got a reprieve from extreme temperatures Friday after hitting triple digits earlier in the week.California\u2019s wet winter boosted plant growth, which is now fueling many of the grass fires across the state, said       Scott McLean,        spokesman for Cal Fire, the state\u2019s largest fire authority.Temperatures were still higher than normal in some areas, presenting a challenge to firefighters.More than 1,200 firefighters are battling a\u00a01,500-acre blaze near Big Bear Lake, Calif., where temperatures Friday were expected to hit a high of 83. The temperature becomes much hotter for workers along the fire line trying to contain the fire by digging fuel such as grass and brush out of the ground, he said.On top of that, the fire-resistant uniforms worn by firefighters often have poor air circulation, sometimes trapping more heat.The past week\u2019s heat wave is unusually longer than the usual three-to-four-day waves, according to the National Weather Service.

Dean Heller\u2019s       surprise announcement on Friday that he opposes the Senate health-care bill as written underlines the complex pressures he faces as he heads into a tough re-election bid next year, and it also highlights the challenges confronting Republican Senate leaders.Mr. Heller, standing alongside Nevada\u2019s Republican Gov.       Brian Sandoval       at a press conference in Las Vegas, said he couldn\u2019t lend his support to the GOP bill in its current form because of its far-reaching changes to the Medicaid program.\u201cI cannot support legislation that takes away insurance from millions of Americans and hundreds of thousands of Nevadans,\u201d said Mr. Heller, who is seen by analysts on both sides as the most vulnerable Senate Republican in 2018. \u201cMake no mistake, the Affordable Care Act does need fixing. But the bill in front of us today doesn\u2019t make those fixes.\u201dThe announcement was in part a recognition that the ACA, a law that Mr. Heller has spent years disparaging, has grown more popular in Nevada. The governor\u2014who is by all accounts close to Mr. Heller\u2014became the first Republican to accept the law\u2019s Medicaid expansion, a move that extended health coverage to about 300,000 state residents.ng. The hesitation over the bill reveals *Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s challenge in cobbling together 50 votes needed for passage, when he leads a narrow 52-48 majority.At Friday\u2019s event, Mr. Heller said he couldn\u2019t support the bill\u2019s timetable for a rollback of the Medicaid expansion, which would begin in 2021 and end federal funding for the expansion in 2024. He said he favored a seven-year timetable, also pushed by other centrist Republicans, and even longer if that option were open to him.In a hypothetical scenario, Mr. Heller trailed a Democratic opponent by seven points, according to a recent survey conducted by Public Policy Polling, a liberal-leaning firm. No Democrat has announced a challenge against him to date, though first-term Rep.       Jacky Rosen,        who represents the southern suburbs of Las Vegas, is expected to launch a bid in coming days, according to Democratic officials.Mr. Heller\u2019s office didn\u2019t respond to multiple requests for interviews.Shifting demographics and a strong union presence have made Nevada more favorable terrain for Democrats in recent years.       Hillary Clinton       won the state in 2016, if narrowly, and Democrats won races down the ballot, including flipping both houses of the state legislature, even while Mr. Sandoval remains popular.Since President       Donald Trump\u2019s       election, an energized Democratic base has mobilized against Mr. Heller. Hecklers have disrupted private events and greeted his public appearances. On the airwaves, outside groups including Planned Parenthood Federation of America, AARP, a coalition of hospitals, and the Senate Democrats\u2019 campaign arm have hammered him with millions of dollars in negative advertising focused on health care.Mr. Heller\u2019s decision on Friday, should he stick to it, could blunt those attacks. But they risk inflaming Nevada\u2019s Republican base by arguably standing in the way of a seven-year GOP promise to uproot the 2010 health law.\u201cHe thinks this will endear him to the left, but they hate him anyway. They can\u2019t stand him,\u201d said       Alan Stock,        a conservative talk-show host on Las Vegas\u2019s CBS radio affiliate.Soon after Mr. Heller\u2019s announcement, America First Policies, a nonprofit group launched by Mr. Trump\u2019s allies to bolster the president\u2019s agenda, said it would launch a seven-figure ad campaign against the senator.Mr. Heller had already said he opposed the House-passed version of the health bill in May. But until the Senate bill\u2019s release on Thursday, he had largely avoided voicing his opinion on the pending legislation.\u201cHe was trying to walk this middle line, trying to split a hair: \u2018I\u2019m against Obamacare but for the [Medicaid] expansion,\u2019\u201d said       Eric Herzik,        a professor at the University of Nevada, Reno, and a political commentator.Mr. Heller has at times seemed to wrestle with elements of the health bill. At a town hall event in April, he was confronted by Planned Parenthood activists, some in birth-control costumes, and pledged he would \u201cprotect\u201d the organization from federal funding cuts.But he appeared to walk back that comment during the event, and his spokeswoman clarified later that Mr. Heller opposed \u201cproviding federal funding to any organization that performs abortions.\u201dBefore Mr. Heller\u2019s Friday announcement,       George Allen,        a home-care worker from Las Vegas, met with the senator in Washington to implore him to oppose cuts to Medicaid, which he said pays the long-term care bills of many Nevada residents and keeps him employed.Mr. Allen said Mr. Heller seemed to share his concerns during their meeting. But \u201cI don\u2019t know if I can trust if he\u2019ll really vote against it,\u201d Mr. Allen said at the time.Mr. Heller\u2019s opposition complicates the already tricky Senate math facing Mr. McConnell (R., Ky.). Republicans can risk losing no more than two among their ranks to pass a bill, with Vice President       Mike Pence       casting a tiebreaking vote if necessary.The four conservative senators said Thursday they would oppose the bill without additional measures deregulating the insurance market, which would tilt the overall bill in a more conservative direction. Mr. Heller\u2019s opposition comes from the other end of the ideological spectrum, reflects a broader tug of war within the Republican Party.Bob List,        a former governor of Nevada, said the Senate math could force GOP leaders to pay attention to Mr. Heller\u2019s concerns.\u201cHe\u2019s a good conservative and he looks after the people of Nevada,\u201d Mr. List said. \u201cIf he feels it\u2019s inadequate in that respect, then he has real strength to negotiate something that he feels is an improvement, because in all probability they\u2019re going to need his vote.\u201d\u2014Rebecca Ballhaus contributed to this article.Write to Michelle Hackman at Michelle.Hackman@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-24 07:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/nevada-senators-opposition-to-health-bill-highlights-political-pressures-1498302002", "news_title": "Nevada Senator\u2019s Opposition to Health Bill Highlights Political Pressures", "keywords": "dean heller, gop health bill, medicaid, nevada, obamacare,republican health bill,Dean Heller,political,general news,health,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,elections,upper house,insurance,non-life insurance,medical insurance,financial services"}, {"content": "Google, which has long portrayed itself as one of the world\u2019s best workplaces, faces government accusations that it underpays women and is resisting pressure to turn over salary data to disprove them.The Labor Department sued Google in January after the company refused to submit 19 years of pay data for more than 21,000 employees for a routine audit into its pay practices. The department needs more Google salary data because an initial review of 2015 figures \u201cfound systemic compensation disparities against women pretty much across the entire workforce,\u201d according to testimony from a Labor Department official in April.Google, a unit of             Alphabet Inc.,        GOOGL 0.59%       says its annual salary analyses show no gender pay gap among its 74,000 employees. \u201cSo we were quite surprised\u201d by the Labor Department\u2019s accusations, \u201cwhich came without any supporting data or methodology,\u201d Google said in an April blog post. Google has declined to release the numbers behind its analyses.Google argued the Labor Department\u2019s request was overly broad, a violation of its employees\u2019 privacy, and costly to comply with. An administrative law judge at the Labor Department is expected to rule soon.The department can investigate Google because the company provides advertising and cloud services for the federal government.Generous compensation and perks have made Google one of the world\u2019s top places to work. But the company\u2019s resistance to release more pay data has further ensnared it in a larger debate about whether women and some minorities have the same shot at success in tech as the white and Asian men who dominate the industry.\u201cThey [Google] say, \u2018Trust us, there is no gender pay gap. We\u2019ve got everything under control,\u2019\u201d said Natasha Lamb, managing partner at Arjuna Capital, a boutique investment firm that has pressed tech companies to release salary information. \u201cA trust-us approach is no longer helpful or useful when other companies are disclosing the data. It makes it look like they have something to hide.\u201dAll the major tech companies\u2014Google,             Facebook Inc.,Apple Inc.,Amazon.com Inc.,Microsoft Corp.       and others\u2014are under pressure to balance their workforces. In their struggle to attract more women and underrepresented minorities, many have highlighted that their internal analyses show they pay men and women equally\u2014but many don\u2019t make the data public.Facebook said in an April blog post that \u201cmen and women are paid the same for the same work\u201d and its \u201ccompensation is intentionally formulaic and reflects individual performance.\u201d The company declined to comment beyond the post.The Labor Department sued             Oracle Corp.       in January, accusing the software giant of paying white men more than their counterparts, and favoring Asians for certain technical roles. Oracle declined to comment.Google has fought earlier efforts to lift the veil on pay. In 2015, then-Google engineer Erica Baker said she faced retaliation from her managers for starting a crowdsourced spreadsheet, in which approximately 5% of employees shared their salaries, that showed disparities. Ms. Baker said the spreadsheet helped some employees negotiate improved salaries, but she left Google that year. Google declined to comment.For the past two years, Arjuna Capital has requested that Google disclose the percentage of female pay to male pay. Seven other firms complied last year, including Apple, Amazon and Microsoft.Google abruptly reneged on an agreement with Arjuna last year to reveal the figure if Arjuna withdrew a shareholder proposal requesting the tech firm to do so, according to emails reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. \u201cAfter further consideration, we are not able to agree to the proposal,\u201d a Google executive wrote in April to Ms. Lamb, according to the emails. Google declined to comment on the emails.Facebook didn\u2019t comply to a similar request from Arjuna to release its pay data.Earlier this month at Alphabet\u2019s shareholder meeting, Ms. Lamb again pressed executives for data. A Google human-resources executive answered that in-depth analyses of 52 separate job categories last year showed the company has no gender pay gap. \u201cWe are really committed to this and absolutely confident in our processes,\u201d he said. Google then moved the meeting along.Google said it has already provided the Labor Department with two years of data among 740,000 pages of documents. The department hasn\u2019t filed formal charges of pay discrimination against Google, and it is unclear if it will. The Labor Department didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.Even with the additional data, it isn\u2019t certain if the question of whether Google has a gender pay gap will be put to rest. Experts say a continuing debate over what equal pay looks like has stalled progress on the issue, exacerbated by a paucity of data from employers.It is possible that where employees or regulators see discrimination, the company sees equal pay, experts say.Equal pay is generally regarded as people being paid the same for doing substantially similar work. But levels of responsibility and job titles could vary even as employees are considered to be doing similar work, leading to pay gaps, said Joelle Emerson, chief executive of Paradigm, which advises tech firms on diversity.A pay gap \u201cdoes not always emerge in these blatant ways where Joe and Jane have the exact same job and the exact same title and he is being paid more,\u201d Ms. Emerson said.Employer-review site Glassdoor Inc. said in April that it analyzed pay data shared by 1,967 Google employees since 2006 and found \u201cno statistical gender pay gap.\u201d Glassdoor said it found a 16.3% pay gap when comparing average pay for men to women as a group, but that gap shrank to 1.6% when it added in factors such as job title, experience and education.Write to Jack Nicas at jack.nicas@wsj.com and Yoree Koh at yoree.koh@wsj.comAppeared in the June 26, 2017, print edition as 'Gender Pay Ruling Looms for Google.'", "news_time": "2017-06-24 07:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/googles-trust-us-approach-doesnt-satisfy-pay-gap-skeptics-1498302004", "news_title": "Google\u2019s \u2018Trust Us\u2019 Approach Doesn\u2019t Satisfy Pay Gap Skeptics", "keywords": "google pay data,wage gap,Alphabet Inc.

She can also barely pay rent.Hardy, who was born and raised in Brooklyn and trains at the borough\u2019s famed Gleason\u2019s Gym, is a single parent and supports her 12-year-old daughter, Annie, by the grace of her gloves. Since turning pro in 2012, Hardy has become one of the highest paid females in her sport with sponsorships from Dove and Adidas and the loyalty of established New York promoter Lou DiBella. Still, she averages about $10,000 per fight while men with comparable resumes bring in six figures or more per bout.\u201cIt seemed like nothing was working,\u201d she said. \u201cI needed a backup plan.\u201dOn Saturday, she puts that plan into action at Madison Square Garden in her first mixed-martial arts fight, where the money is greater but the risks are too.Saturday\u2019s showdown against flyweight Alice Yauger (4-5) will be broadcast on Spike TV, the first fight on live TV for Hardy, something she hopes will bring national exposure to women\u2019s boxing. More air time means more money. With money comes freedom for Hardy to move between combat sports as she pleases, not just when the bill are due.But MMA is also in some respects more violent than boxing\u2014one reason for its popularity \u2014and not automatically an easy transition for a 35-year-old making her first appearance in the cage.\u201cIf I get injured, then my boxing career is over too,\u201d Hardy said. \u201cThis is probably the most dangerous back up plan outside of being a hitman.\u201dAfter developing big-name female fighters such as Ronda Rousey, MMA offers more gender-equitable purses than boxing. Though neither Hardy nor DiBella would say what she\u2019ll make from Saturday\u2019s fight, they said it would be more than what she earned in her WBC title-defense victory over Edina Kiss in March. The bout is part of an undercard for the event Bellator NYC, which will feature 14 fights.The matchup is Hardy\u2019s second attempt at an MMA debut, as her first fight in January was cancelled when opponent Brieta Carpenter withdrew at the last minute due to injury.\u201cThey just left her high and dry. She got paid nothing,\u201d said DiBella.Hardy\u2019s situation was aggravated by the New York State assembly\u2019s move last August to revise health insurance regulations for combat sports, making boxing matches for women in New York prohibitively expensive.Hardy says she was on the precipice of poverty before receiving an anonymous check in the mail from someone who sent money to pay for Annie\u2019s Christmas gifts. A second check arrived a month later for rent.\u201cI was pretty much saved by the kindness of strangers,\u201d she said.With an adjustment to the New York law, women\u2019s matches resumed again early this year in mid-January.After two boxing bouts this spring, Hardy says her finances are not as dire. Debts still loom. To prepare for an MMA fight, Hardy must cover the cost of gym time and trainers specializing in jujitsu, wrestling and grappling on top of her regular boxing and conditioning workouts\u2014about $700 per month.Those in her corner say not to bet against her.\u201cShe is like the pioneer in trying things there,\u201d said Devon Cormack, Hardy\u2019s longtime trainer at Gleason\u2019s. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t quit.\u201d", "news_time": "2017-06-24 07:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/undefeated-boxer-and-single-mom-takes-on-a-new-fight-1498302006", "news_title": "Undefeated Boxer (and Single Mom) Takes on a New Fight ", "keywords": "boxing,combat sports,sports,recreation,routine general news"}]
