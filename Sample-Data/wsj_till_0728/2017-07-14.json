[{"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014The Russian-born lobbyist who attended a meeting with       Donald Trump Jr.       in Trump Tower last year is known as a bon vivant representative of Russian interests in Washington whose latest work against sanctions on Moscow has drawn congressional scrutiny and allegations of ties to Russian intelligence.Rinat Akhmetshin,        who confirmed that he attended the meeting with Mr. Trump and two other Russians last year, has lately led an uphill battle against the Magnitsky Act, a raft of legislation that targets Russians suspected of involvement in corruption and human-rights abuses.Mr. Akhmetshin declined to comment for this article but told the Associated Press that reports of his ties to Russian intelligence were part of a \u201csmear campaign.\u201d Though he served in the Soviet army from 1986 to 1988, he was never trained in spycraft, Mr. Akhmetshin said.He has worked as a lobbyist and public-relations consultant in Washington for more than a decade. His early\u00a0clients included Russians who were trying to burnish their image in the U.S. after making a fortune in their own nation\u2019s rough-and-tumble economy.Mr. Akhmetshin was known among journalists for his taste for fine restaurants and clients in high places. He arranged media interviews for       Andrei Vavilov,        a former deputy finance minister, whose car was blown up outside his Moscow office in 1997 and who was buffeted by corruption allegations inside Russia that he denied. Mr. Vavilov is now a deputy in the upper house of Russia\u2019s parliament.Legal wrangles and congressional scrutiny of Mr. Akhmetshin suggest a contentious side to his work. In one case filed in New York, a Russian mining company accused him of being involved in the hacking of its computer systems. The allegations were later withdrawn, according to court documents.Last year, Mr. Akhmetshin appears to have begun devoting more time to working against the Magnitsky Act. In doing so, he\u00a0clashed with U.S.-born fund manager       Bill Browder,        who pushed for the legislation after he was kicked out of Russia and his accountant,       Sergei Magnitsky,        was arrested and died in a Russian prison where he had been denied medical attention.In early 2016, Mr. Akhmetshin helped set up a nonprofit foundation in Delaware, the Human Rights Accountability Global Initiative, to lobby U.S. officials in an effort to strip Mr. Magnitsky\u2019s name from the laws, he told the Associated Press.Mr. Browder said the group is a facade for the Kremlin seeking to repeal the Magnitsky laws.\u00a0Last year the group helped promote the screening of an anti-Magnitsky documentary film at the Newseum in Washington that Mr. Browder and human-rights groups said was rife with factual errors and distortions.In attendance at the screening was       Natalia Veselnitskaya,        the Russian lawyer who met with Donald Trump Jr. around the time the film was screened.The Senate Judiciary Committee will likely look into Mr. Akhmetshin\u2019s work when it holds a hearing in Washington next week to examine possible violations of the Foreign Agents Registration Act. The committee also is investigating a complaint by Mr. Browder that\u00a0Mr. Akhmetshin and other Washington-based lobbyists violated U.S. laws by failing to register with the Department of Justice.Write to Alan Cullison at alan.cullison@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-14 23:20:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/russian-born-lobbyist-draws-scrutiny-over-work-in-u-s-1500088807", "news_title": "Russian-Born Lobbyist Draws Scrutiny Over Work in U.S.  ", "keywords": "russian lobbyist,trump jr.,Donald Trump Jr,Bill Browder,Rinat Akhmetshin,regulation,government policy,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,society,community,human rights,civil liberties"}, {"content": "Insurers are ramping up their opposition to a new amendment in the Senate Republican health bill that would allow them to sell plans that don\u2019t meet Affordable Care Act requirements, an effort that could add to the challenges faced by GOP leaders trying to shepherd the legislation.The provision, backed by Texas Sen.       Ted Cruz,        would authorize insurers to sell coverage that wouldn\u2019t meet ACA standards on the condition that they also sell at least some plans that did. While this setup could offer healthy people less expensive policies, insurers and actuaries say it would likely prove dysfunctional over time, pushing up rates and reducing offerings for people buying the compliant plans.In a letter sent Friday night to the Senate Republican and Democratic leadership, the two major associations representing health insurers, which don\u2019t typically send such missives jointly, said the amendment \u201cis simply unworkable in any form and would undermine protections for those with pre-existing medical conditions, increase premiums and lead to widespread terminations of coverage for people currently enrolled in the individual market.\u201dThe fate of the bill is on a knife-edge. Two Republican Senators have already said they oppose it, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) cannot afford to lose any more Republicans to get the 50-vote majority the legislation needs to pass. Vice President       Mike Pence       would break any tie. No Democrats are expected to support the GOP bill.The letter from America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans and the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association may alarm moderate Republican senators who have pledged to protect coverage for people with pre-existing medical conditions. But on the other side, the provision\u2019s inclusion has been vital in winning over Sen. Cruz, and it is supported by other conservatives, though some feel it doesn\u2019t go far enough to wall off the healthier market from the sicker consumers\u2019 costs.In an interview, Sen. Cruz said the provision is essential to his support of the bill. He said his amendment \u201ctakes nothing away\u201d and would help millions of people by allowing them to buy lower-cost coverage, including with pretax dollars from health savings accounts, which in turn would boost insurance pools overall.The noncompliant plans sold under the Cruz amendment could be more limited than today\u2019s ACA coverage, lacking benefits such as maternity care, and could feature higher out-of-pocket costs and potentially annual or lifetime limits on coverage, said\u00a0      Larry Levitt,        a senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation.Also, insurers could refuse to sell these noncompliant plans to unhealthy people, or they could charge enrollees higher premiums based on their health conditions, according to Mr. Levitt.The upshot, experts say: The noncompliant plans would likely be far less expensive and would draw healthy enrollees away from the compliant plans. That could leave the compliant plans with a sicker customer pool that generates higher medical costs on average, pushing up premiums.\u201cThere are certainly winners and losers with this program,\u201d said       Kurt Wrobel,        a fellow of the Society of Actuaries and chief actuary at Geisinger Health Plan. \u201cIndividuals that were healthier and not getting a subsidy in some respects would be better off, those with pre-existing conditions would be made worse off.\u201dIn their letter, the insurance associations said that if the amendment becomes law, \u201cpremiums will skyrocket for people with pre-existing conditions.\u201d The provision \u201cwill lead to far fewer, if any, coverage options for consumers who purchase their plan in the individual market. As a result, millions of more individuals will become uninsured,\u201d the associations said.The bill contains some mechanisms designed to avoid this outcome. It adds billions of dollars in stabilization funds that could help hold down premiums for those buying ACA-compliant plans. Also, to access federal premium assistance under the Senate bill, consumers would need to purchase the compliant coverage, which could keep lower-income, healthy people in the mix.The insurers\u2019 letter said the funding is \u201cinsufficient and additional funding will not make the provision workable for consumers or taxpayers.\u201dDefenders of the Cruz amendment have noted that it does keep the compliant and noncompliant plans in the same risk pool, meaning that their pricing is supposed to be linked.However, the amendment disables an important mechanism for ensuring that link is meaningful, insurers say. Under the ACA, a program called \u201crisk adjustment\u201d forces insurers that enroll a lot of healthy people to pay out money to competitors with sicker, costlier enrollees. That program won\u2019t include the new noncompliant plans offered under the Cruz amendment.\u201cAll the language that says there is a single risk pool is meaningless,\u201d said       Raj Bal,       \u00a0an insurance-industry consultant. \u201cYou\u2019ll have two pools.\u201dActuaries and insurers say insurance companies would have an incentive to cherry pick\u2014to offer a few expensive, unappealing plans that complied with ACA rules, aiming to attract few enrollees, and to focus instead on the skinny plans that could draw healthy people, which are likely to be more profitable.\u201cIt\u2019s difficult when you\u2019ve got two sets of rules, and you\u2019ve got an uneven playing field where you can\u2019t compete against that cherry picking,\u201d said       Justine Handelman,        a senior vice president at the Blue Cross insurer group. Some insurers \u201cmay be forced to pull out of the market.\u2026You could see widespread terminations.\u201d\u2014Louise Radnofsky contributed to this article.Write to Anna Wilde Mathews at anna.mathews@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-14 23:04:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/insurers-oppose-cruz-amendment-to-republican-health-care-bill-1500087886", "news_title": "Insurers Oppose Cruz Amendment to Republican Health-Care Bill", "keywords": " aca, affordable care act,obamacare, repeal, replace, republican health,Ted Cruz,political,general news,society,community,health,politics,international relations,domestic politics,welfare,social services,insurance,non-life insurance,medical insurance,health care,life sciences,financial services"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014The Russian lawyer whom Donald Trump Jr.,       Jared Kushner       and       Paul Manafort       met last year with the hopes of receiving damaging information about       Hillary Clinton       says she talked with the office of Russia\u2019s top prosecutor while waging a campaign against a U.S. sanctions law and the hedge-fund manager who backed it.Lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya said she wasn\u2019t working for Russian authorities, but she said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal that she was meeting with Russian authorities regularly and shared information about the hedge-fund manager with the Russian prosecutor general\u2019s office, including with Prosecutor General Yuri Chaika, a top official appointed by the Kremlin.\u201cI personally know the general prosecutor,\u201d Ms. Veselnitskaya said. \u201cIn the course of my investigation [about the fund manager], I shared information with him.\u201dMr. Chaika\u2019s office didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment on whether he knows and received information from Ms. Veselnitskaya.President Donald Trump and others have stressed that she wasn\u2019t formally working for the Russian government at the time of the June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower. Mr. Trump said on Thursday at a news conference in Paris that his son\u2019s meeting was brief and uneventful. \u201cHe took a meeting with a Russian lawyer. Not a government lawyer, but a Russian lawyer,\u201d Mr. Trump said.Ms. Veselnitskaya says she was working to spread information about William Browder, the U.S.-born fund manager turned Kremlin critic, who lobbied for passage of a 2012 U.S. law that incensed Moscow. The law, known as the Magnitsky Act, sanctioned Russians accused of defrauding Mr. Browder\u2019s firm in Russia out of $230 million and causing the death of his lawyer, Sergei Magnitsky, who died in Russian custody.Also working on the anti-Magnitsky Act effort was a former Soviet military serviceman turned U.S. lobbyist, Rinat Akhmetshin, who told the Journal that he attended the meeting at Trump Tower. Mr. Akhmetshin\u2019s presence at the meeting wasn\u2019t previously disclosed by       Donald Trump Jr.       or the White House.The multiyear saga between Russia and Mr. Browder has featured accusations of murder and fraud, extensive lobbying efforts on both sides, high-level court proceedings and public statements by Russian President       Vladimir Putin       suggesting Mr. Browder is a criminal. And now, the drama has extended to the Trump White House, which is already facing probes into the campaign\u2019s relationship with Russia.Mr. Browder, who has denied any wrongdoing, and federal prosecutors in the U.S. claim that Russian officials and people linked to Russian officials participated in the fraud against his fund.Ms. Veselnitskaya says she is a former Moscow regional prosecutor turned private attorney, and represents Prevezon Holdings, a Cyprus-based hotel and real-estate group owned by Russian national Denis Katsyv. Mr. Katsyv\u2019s father, Pytor, is a former top Moscow region official and vice president of state-owned Russian Railways. She says she was compiling information about Mr. Browder on behalf of Prevezon and met with the Trump camp to share her findings.In 2014, Preet Bharara, the U.S. attorney in the Southern District of New York, alleged that Prevezon laundered defrauded money from Mr. Browder\u2019s fund into U.S. bank accounts and Manhattan real estate. Earlier this year, U.S. authorities and Prevezon reached a $5.9 million civil settlement. The company didn\u2019t admit wrongdoing as part of the settlement.Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee this week asked Attorney General Jeff Sessions whether the Trump Tower meeting was in any way connected to the settlement, which came two months after President Trump fired Mr. Bharara.A spokeswoman for the Justice Department didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.Ms. Veselnitskaya also said that at the time of the Trump Tower meeting she was representing Aras Agalarov, the Russian-Azerbaijani property developer who organized the 2013 Miss Universe pageant with President Trump in Moscow. However, in email correspondence with Donald Trump Jr., a British publicist presented her as a Russian government lawyer, a description she said was a mischaracterization.Through the publicist, Mr. Agalarov\u2019s pop-star son Emin helped arrange Ms. Veselnitskaya\u2019s meeting with Donald Trump Jr., one of various people she said she petitioned to assist in her effort to have the law repealed and discredit Mr. Browder.Rob Goldstone, the British publicist who worked for the Agalarovs, wrote in an email to the president\u2019s son that the elder Mr. Agalarov had met with Russia\u2019s top prosecutor who offered to provide the Trump campaign incriminating information on Mrs. Clinton. Ms. Veselnitskaya says she asked the elder Mr. Agalarov for help in arranging a meeting with the Trump campaign but denies it was about Mrs. Clinton. Both Ms. Veselnitskaya and Mr. Agalarov deny the meeting was arranged at Mr. Chaika\u2019s request.\u201cNatalia has done some real estate-related legal work for Mr. Agalarov\u2019s company over the years,\u201d said Scott Balber, an attorney representing the Agalarov family. He denied the elder Mr. Agalarov met with Mr. Chaika, the prosecutor general,\u200b as described in the email. Mr. Agalarov, speaking on Russian radio Wednesday, called the content of the correspondence \u201csome kind of fiction.\u201dAsked whether Mr. Chaika requested or participated in arranging Ms. Veselnitskaya\u2019s meeting in New York or met with Mr. Agalarov, the Russian prosecutor general\u2019s office said it \u201cdoes not exchange information and does not conduct any meetings at the international level outside the framework regulated by international legal agreements and Russian procedural legislation.\u201dMs. Veselnitskaya saw the younger Mr. Trump and his colleagues in Trump Tower on June 9 of last year.\u201cBy the time I stepped into the meeting room to talk with Donald Trump Jr., all I knew was that I approached the elder Mr. Agalarov with a request to help,\u201d Ms. Veselnitskaya said. \u201cAnd I knew his son Emin communicated with Donald Trump Jr.\u201dShe said her meeting wasn\u2019t coordinated with official Russian government structures. She did, however, share information similar to what the Russian prosecutor general\u2019s office gave to Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R., Calif.) in a Moscow meeting two months earlier. Namely, she said she wanted to inform the Trump campaign of allegations that an American firm Mr. Browder worked with, Ziff Brothers Investments, had dodged taxes in Russia and later donated to Democrats.A spokesman for Ziff Brothers Investments declined to comment for this article.\u201cBoth during the meeting, while I was talking to Donald Trump Jr., and in the written materials I prepared, I was trying to tell the story that I myself had personally investigated,\u201d Ms. Veselnitskaya said, referring to Mr. Browder.Donald Trump Jr. wasn\u2019t satisfied with the quality of the information she provided. In an interview Tuesday with       Sean Hannity       on Fox News, the younger Mr. Trump said: \u201cIt was this, \u2018Hey, some DNC donors may have done something in Russia and they didn\u2019t pay taxes.\u2019 I was like, \u2018What does this have to do with anything?\u2019\u201dMs. Veselnitskaya said: \u201cMy expectation before the meeting was he read my letter of information, he got interested, and he was going to help me. His expectations were totally different, as I can understand now.\u201dMr. Browder denies the accusations that Ms. Veselnitskaya and the prosecutor general\u2019s office have been leveling against him. He calls them \u201cstale and disproven\u201d and says they\u2019re part of a well-resourced, Moscow-coordinated campaign to undermine him and the Magnitsky Act. The law he helped get passed angered Kremlin authorities in part because it allowed the U.S. to add Russian human-rights violators easily to a U.S. sanctions list, even individuals who had no part in the Magnitsky case.\u201cThey were on a major full-court press on all fronts with Congress, with the press \u2026 with Trump Jr.,\u201d Mr. Browder said, describing Ms. Veselnitskaya as a critical part of the anti-Magnitsky Act effort. \u201cI think that she\u2019s working hand in glove with Chaika, and it\u2019s all part of a coordinated strategy back at headquarters.\u201dThe Russian prosecutor general\u2019s office didn\u2019t respond to a request for further comment.Mr. Putin has called the Magnitsky Act \u201cimperialist behavior\u201d by the U.S. and said Russian authorities believe Mr. Browder himself broke the law. Mr. Putin denied that Russian authorities were criminally negligent in the death of Mr. Magnitsky.\u201cThere was a tragedy,\u201d Mr. Putin said in 2013. \u201cWhat, in American prisons, no one ever dies or something?\u201dMr. Browder filed a complaint with the Justice Department in July 2016 that accused Ms. Veselnitskaya and others of violating U.S. lobbying laws by pushing for a repeal of the Magnitsky Act without registering their activities properly with the Justice Department. He says he hasn\u2019t received a response.The U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee is slated to hold a hearing later this month on violations of the lobbying law, known as the Foreign Agents Registration Act. Mr. Browder is scheduled to testify about the activities of Ms. Veselitskaya and others, the committee announced this week.\u2014Christopher S.

Last month\u2019s Supreme Court\u2019s decision allowed the GOP president to enforce the ban against people with no ties to the U.S., but not against people who have close connections to family or institutions in the U.S.Mr. Trump\u2019s administration took a narrow reading of who qualified for the Supreme Court\u2019s exemption to the ban. But Judge Watson, an appointee of Mr. Trump\u2019s Democratic predecessor,       Barack Obama,        ruled Thursday that the government must admit a broader class of people than it wanted. That includes extended family members like grandparents, aunts and uncles, as well as a wider class of refugees.The judge found that the Trump administration\u2019s restricted view of who counts as close family \u201crepresents the antithesis of common sense.\u201d The administration said its approach was grounded solidly in how close family relationships are defined in portions of federal immigration law.The Supreme Court is already set to give the case full consideration in October. But the Justice Department signaled Friday it wants to block Judge Watson\u2019s ruling before then.The department filed an immediate appeal in a West Coast appeals court and on Friday night also filed new papers with the Supreme Court seeking intervention by the justices, arguing the Hawaii judge\u2019s ruling would severely impair the implementation of the travel ban.\u201cThe Supreme Court has had to correct this lower court once, and we will now reluctantly return directly to the Supreme Court to again vindicate the rule of law and the executive branch\u2019s duty to protect the nation,\u201d Attorney General Jeff Sessions said.The high court is on a three-month summer break, and some justices are traveling. But it is possible the court could act on the Justice Department\u2019s request before it returns for its new term in October.Apart from the court battle, administration officials said the government is considering expanding the ban geographically, setting its sights on countries beyond the six now targeted: Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.In addition to restricting travel, Mr. Trump\u2019s March executive order called for a global review of every country to assess whether each is providing the U.S. with information needed to vet their citizens seeking to travel here.Those that don\u2019t meet the new U.S. standards could be subjected to travel restrictions like those imposed on the six nations singled out in the current order, administration officials said.This week, the Department of Homeland Security sent a report to the White House that included a list of countries that have been preliminarily assessed as not providing adequate information, as well as those at risk of not providing it.A U.S. official said 17 countries were flagged though details about their status weren\u2019t available.Under the new standards under consideration, each country would have to issue electronic passports, or have plans to do so, and regularly report lost and stolen passports to Interpol, an international policing organization, according to administration officials.In addition, every nation would be required to share information with the U.S. about suspected terrorists; share information about their citizens\u2019 criminal backgrounds and histories; and provide information about identity documents they issue to the U.S. to help officials better identify frauds.Nations would also have to assure they aren\u2019t terrorist havens and agree to take back citizens if they are deported from the U.S.Administration officials and other experts said it was clear from the start that many nations would be unable or unwilling to meet these standards, including potentially all six of the countries targeted in the current executive order.A State Department cable outlining the new standards advises embassies to alert foreign governments that noncompliance could mean their citizens won\u2019t be able to travel to the U.S. The cable directs embassy officials to tell their foreign counterparts that the U.S. intention isn\u2019t to ban travel but that failure to make progress on these goals could result in just that.An administration official said that embassies will inform their host countries where they stand in the review and what information, if any, is missing to meet the new requirements.The prospect of a broader travel ban has long been a concern to those challenging Mr. Trump\u2019s travel restrictions in court. Civil-rights groups and advocates for immigrants and refugees have alleged the president was seeking to make good on his support during the presidential campaign for a Muslim ban. Mr. Trump has rejected the allegations, saying his intention is to keep dangerous people off U.S. soil.The implementation of a new, broader ban would likely spark an entirely new round of litigation.\u2014Shane Harris and Felicia Schwartz contributed to this article.Write to Brent Kendall at brent.kendall@wsj.com and Laura Meckler at laura.meckler@wsj.comAppeared in the July 15, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-07-14 22:07:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-appeals-latest-travel-ban-ruling-1500072777", "news_title": "Trump Appeals Latest Travel-Ban Ruling", "keywords": " appeal, derrick watson, donald trump, family members, grandparents, hawaii, homeland security, restrictions, six countries, supreme court,travel ban,Donald Trump,political,general news,national,public security,crime,legal action,politics,international relations,domestic politics,state security measures,policies,government bodies,executive branch,justice department,judicial branch"}, {"content": "PROVIDENCE, R.I.\u2014Governors had a message for foreign officials including Canadian Prime Minister       Justin Trudeau      : They have influence with the federal government when it comes to trade.\u201cYes, they set trade policy\u2014but governors have significant ability to shape that,\u201d Kentucky Gov.

The new program has led to 565 prosecutions.The illegal immigrants are charged with misdemeanors and tried in federal court under Operation Streamline, a 12-year-old initiative in which the migrants are charged, enter pleas and are sentenced within a few minutes in large groups.A recent docket for Operation Streamline, which takes place in Tucson several times a week, shows that 58 immigrants were tried on Thursday. About 35 were first-time offenders who were charged with improper entry. The rest were migrants who have previously been caught at the border and were charged with illegal re-entry.A decline in the number of people crossing the border has freed up resources for the Border Patrol to go after first-time offenders, the agency said.In April, the number of people apprehended on the southwest border trying to enter the U.S. fell to its lowest level in nearly two decades.The program for first-time offenders is already in place in one part of Texas and was previously in effect in Tucson, although it has been several years since it was used.The program \u201cis aimed specifically to deter people from coming to the country illegally in a way that prevents deaths,\u201d Tucson Sector spokesman Daniel Hernandez said. \u201cIt creates consequences in the west desert region where we\u2019re having a lot of people distressed.\u201dThe Tucson Sector has seen a rash of heat deaths and rescues during the past few weeks.\u2014Copyright 2017 the Associated Press", "news_time": "2017-07-14 21:43:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/illegal-immigrants-face-criminal-charges-for-first-offenses-1500072081", "news_title": "Illegal Immigrants Face Criminal Charges for First Offenses", "keywords": "border patrol,illegal immigrants,prosecution,tucson sector,undocumented,political,general news,crime,legal action,illegal immigration,migration,politics,international relations,trafficking,smuggling"}, {"content": "New York City\u2019s medical examiner ruled Friday that the death of a 5-year-old Queens boy in January was a homicide.The child,       Michael Guzman,        died of acute phenobarbital intoxication, said a spokeswoman for the New York City Office of Chief Medical Examiner. Phenobarbital is a barbiturate that depresses the central nervous system and is sometimes used to treat epilepsy, among other medical disorders.No arrests had been made as of Friday afternoon, according to a New York Police Department official.Earlier in the week, the deaths of two toddlers,       Olivia Gee,        2, and       Micah Gee,        3, were also ruled homicides, with each dying from \u201cblunt impact\u201d to the torso, according to the medical examiner\u2019s office. Police are still investigating and no arrests have been made.At the time of Michael Guzman\u2019s death, law-enforcement officials said the child, found in his home, showed no outward signs of physical abuse, though he had been dead for a \u201cprotracted period of time.\u201dThe boy\u2019s home was known to the city\u2019s child welfare investigators as far back as 2008, according to law-enforcement officials familiar with the investigation. Thirteen complaints, mostly for alleged child neglect, were filed against the household from 2008 to 2016, officials said. Six of the complaints were in the last five years, one official said.There were at least five children living in the house at the time of the boy\u2019s death, a law-enforcement official said, adding that there was a complaint filed for domestic violence at the household.At the time of the boy\u2019s death, the city\u2019s Administration for Children\u2019s Services faced increased scrutiny for the deaths of other children, including the September 2016 death of 6-year-old       Zymere Perkins.       Two reports, one from the city and one from the New York State Office of Children and Family Services, showed that the ACS didn\u2019t follow protocols to protect the boy from child abuse.As a result of the report on Zymere Perkins, the state ordered the city to appoint an independent monitor to oversee the agency.After Michael Guzman\u2019s death was ruled a homicide, a spokesperson for ACS said Friday, \u201cWe are deeply saddened by this terrible tragedy, and we continue to investigate along with NYPD.\u201d\u201cOur hearts are broken by this tragedy. Every child in this city matters, which is why we continue to make improvements and implement new reforms at ACS for the safety and well-being of our city\u2019s children,\u201d said Jaclyn Rothenberg, a spokeswoman for Mayor       Bill de Blasio.Write to Melanie Grayce West at melanie.west@wsj.com and Zolan Kanno-Youngs at Zolan.Kanno-Youngs@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-14 20:06:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/death-of-5-year-old-boy-ruled-a-homicide-1500069366", "news_title": "Death of 5-Year-Old Boy Ruled a Homicide ", "keywords": " acs,boy's death, child deaths,New York Police Department,New York State Office of Children and Family Services,New York City Office of Chief Medical Examiner,Michael Guzman,political,general news,crime,legal action,murder,manslaughter"}, {"content": "A congressional investigation into Russia\u2019s attempts to influence the 2016 election is intensifying its focus on whether Trump campaign officials coordinated with Moscow in using social media to spread false news stories and other messages that boosted his prospects.Both House and Senate intelligence committees have been requesting documents, pressing for interviews with Trump campaign officials and, lawmakers say, speaking to social-media companies as part of a broader probe into Russia\u2019s role in the election.Among the ex-campaign officials the committees want to question is       Jared Kushner,        President       Donald Trump\u2019s       son-in-law and now a senior White House adviser.Jamie Gorelick,        a Kushner attorney, has previously said Mr. Kushner will cooperate with the investigations. Abbe Lowell, another Kushner lawyer, declined to comment on Friday about the social-media issue.Brad Parscale, who served as a campaign digital strategist, said on             Twitter                   Friday that he had agreed to meet with House investigators.At issue, lawmakers say, is Russia\u2019s efforts to sway voters in key battleground states. Deploying internet tools, Russian operatives were able to give erroneous news stories more prominence, driving them to the top of people\u2019s social-media feeds, some lawmakers said.\u201cWe want to determine whether there was any effort to coordinate that effort with the data and analytical operation of the Trump campaign,\u201d said Rep. Adam Schiff (D., Calif.), the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say we\u2019ve arrived at any conclusion about whether there was any coordination in the effort, but it is something that needs to be investigated.\u201dSen.

Mr. Trump has said Russia was \u201cprobably\u201d involved in cyberattacks targeting Democrats but added that other countries could have played a part.Both the House and Senate are running investigations with the aim of writing a public report. The Federal Bureau of Investigation, under the supervision of special counsel Robert Mueller, is examining whether any criminal laws were broken.The House panel, which largely meets behind closed doors, is now examining whether there was any Russian connection or interference in the campaign\u2019s political data and analytics operations.On Friday, Mr. Parscale, the digital media director for the Trump campaign, said\u00a0he had\u00a0accepted an invitation to speak to congressional investigators.Mr. Parscale, who worked for the Trump Organization before becoming one of the top digital strategists for the campaign, said in a statement posted on Twitter\u00a0that he\u2019s \u201cunaware of any Russian involvement in the digital and data operations of the 2016 Trump presidential campaign,\u201d\u201cThe only collaboration I am aware of in the Trump digital campaign was with staff provided to the campaign by             Facebook,       Google and Twitter. Those experts in digital marketing worked side-by-side with our teams,\u201d he added.As the campaign unfolded, Mr. Kushner took on important pieces of the operation at his father-in-law\u2019s urging, a person familiar with the matter said. Among them: the campaign\u2019s data operation.Separately, Michael R. Caputo, a former communications adviser on the Trump campaign, testified before the House committee behind closed doors on Friday. Mr. Caputo had done business in Russia before joining the campaign, but his attorney said Mr. Caputo had no \u201cRussian income, Russian contracts, Russian business for several years.\u201d\u201cI spent my time in front of the committee detailing the fact that I had no contact with Russians, that I never heard of any one in the Trump campaign talking with Russians,\u201d Mr. Caputo said after his interview with House members.Mr. Caputo also said given the structure of the Trump campaign, he could understand how the president\u2019s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., son-in-law Jared Kushner and campaign chairman       Paul Manafort       would\u2019ve taken a meeting with a Russian lawyer promising information helpful to the campaign, an encounter that was made public over the past week and has been scrutinized by lawmakers of both parties.\u201cThere was more offered opposition research offered at the Trump campaign than I\u2019ve ever seen in my 30 years in elections,\u201d Mr. Caputo said, adding that most other campaigns would\u2019ve had a robust opposition research team to handle the flow of incoming information. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have that.\u201d\u2014Joshua Jamerson contributed to this article.Write to Byron Tau at byron.tau@wsj.com and Peter Nicholas at peter.nicholas@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-14 19:19:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-campaign-digital-chief-to-meet-with-house-russia-investigators-1500054319", "news_title": "Russia Probe Focuses on Trump Campaign\u2019s Digital Efforts", "keywords": "2016 election,digital media in politics,donald trump,house russia probe,russian meddling,social media,Donald Trump,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,elections,national,presidential elections,online service providers,media,entertainment,social media platforms,tools,technology"}, {"content": "A new milelong stretch of sand formed off North Carolina\u2019s Outer Banks in April, the first new shoal in the 100-mile chain of barrier islands in a generation.\u201cIntroducing the newest member of our family,\u201d the local tourism board said in an aerial tour video posted July 2. Believed to have been created through sand from eroding beaches farther north joining an existing offshore shoal, the sandbar is as wide as two football fields and has been named \u201cShelly Island\u201d by locals for its abundant shells.Visitors must swim or take a kayak or paddleboard to get to the crescent-shaped island off the southernmost tip of Cape Hatteras National Seashore. Shelly Island has no communities, cars or development. It isn\u2019t expected to survive a year, with the same natural forces that helped form it likely to carry the sand elsewhere. But its addition to the narrow chain of barrier islands that North Carolina communities spend millions to maintain illustrates the fluidity of the Atlantic coast from Miami to the Chesapeake Bay.\u201cFor the general public, it\u2019s like land flying down,\u201d said       Paul Liu,        a geological oceanographer with North Carolina State University. But wind, weather and currents are always moving, he said. \u201cThe beautiful part of nature is that it\u2019s changing. This is the perfect example.\u201dBut that changeableness creates complications for beach communities. The Atlantic coastline is especially fragile along the Outer Banks, where the width of islands in some stretches is barely that of a two-lane highway. Some of the area\u2019s most iconic structures have already been moved to prevent their collapse into the ocean.In 1999, the National Park Service moved the black-and-white striped Cape Hatteras lighthouse a half-mile west to prevent its \u201calmost certain destruction.\u201d In 2010, fans of the 2008 Richard Gere-Diane Lane movie \u201cNights in Rodanthe\u201d bought the oceanfront inn featured in the film and moved it to a safer lot a mile away.Shelly Island formed at one of the most dynamic spots on the East Coast. Moving sandbars are so notorious in the region that centuries ago the Outer Banks was dubbed the \u201cGraveyard of the Atlantic\u201d because of all the ships that wrecked on its shoals.The island, located where the warm northbound Gulf Stream current meets the cold southbound Labrador Current, likely grew much larger than a normal sandbar because of the mild winter, Mr. Liu said. Fewer Nor\u2019easter storms along the Carolina coast affected the north-south movement of sand. \u201cSome places lose the sand, some places receive the sand,\u201d Mr. Liu said.While some of its sand would have come from an offshore shoal, coastal geologist       Stanley R. Riggs       said the island also likely comprises sand that migrated from the same eroded beaches a few miles north that are now being replenished with artificially added sand, a process called beach nourishment.Barrier islands like those of the Outer Banks are meant to move with currents and big storms, growing in size during storm surges to protect the mainland, Mr. Riggs said. But pumping sand keeps them artificially in place, as does the grading for roads, bridges and buildings that restrict the islands\u2019 height.\u201cWe\u2019re going to end up destroying what we\u2019ve got out there if we\u2019re not careful,\u201d Mr. Riggs said.Environmentalists say the appearance of an abundance of sand just south of eroded coastline shows the futility of artificially bulking up beaches.\u201cWhat we\u2019re facing in places like the Outer Banks is the expenditure of a tremendous amount of money to try to deal with eroding, disappearing beaches,\u201d said       Derb Carter,        director of the Chapel Hill office for the Southern Environmental Law Center, an advocacy group that has filed lawsuits against the state over environmental issues. \u201cEventually a lot of hard decisions will have to be made about whether that can be sustained.\u201dBut Dare County Commissioner       Danny Couch       said such projects are critical for the $1 billion local tourism business, which accounts for one in three jobs in the county. Local governments in Dare County are spending $50 million to pump sand on 10 miles of eroded beach this year, including a 3-mile stretch in Buxton, just north of Shelly Island.Mr. Couch, a tour guide in the area, supports the investment in sand, which is largely paid for by tourists through a tax on hotel rooms and rental houses.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter whether I agree with it or not,\u201d Mr. Couch said. \u201cUntil we come up with long-term solutions, the only avenue we have to protect what sells this place, our beaches, is beach nourishment.\u201dShelly Island has also raised jurisdictional and safety issues. If the sand eventually migrates to the shore at the park, it would be federal property, according to Cape Hatteras National Seashore staff. For now, the island is located in state waters, and Dare County officials say the local Hatteras Island Rescue Squad has been standing watch. So far, they\u2019ve saved 11 people stranded on or nearby the island. Access to the island was blocked July 14 as U.S. Navy explosive investigators secured a device that washed up on the beach and appeared to be military related.A trip to the new slice of land was tops on       Christy Seaton\u2019s       to-do list during her vacation earlier this month. She and a dozen family members drove an hour south from their rental house in Duck, N.C., to the Cape Hatteras National Seashore, then walked a mile to the park\u2019s southern tip and swam the length of two swimming pools to reach the beach.\u201cIt was my first trip to uncharted territory,\u201d said Ms. Seaton, a cake decorator from Mullens, W.Va. \u201cIt was worth it.\u201dThe Outer Banks Visitors Bureau made the Shelly Island video to celebrate the interaction of the ocean and the barrier islands, part of what director       Lee Nettles       said attracts as many as 5 million visitors annually.\u201cThe shape of the island changes, the inlets take different forms, the shoreline changes,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the fascination people have with the place.\u201dWrite to Valerie Bauerlein at valerie.bauerlein@wsj.comAppeared in the July 15, 2017, print edition as 'From Time and Tides, a New Shoal.'", "news_time": "2017-07-14 19:17:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-new-island-in-north-carolina-points-to-the-challenges-of-changing-coastlines-1500074224", "news_title": "A New Island in North Carolina Points to the Challenges of Changing Coastlines", "keywords": "barrier islands,beach erosion,cape hatteras lighthouse ,chesapeake bay,infrastructure,miami beach,nights in rodanthe,north carolina outer banks,outer banks,sandbanks,shelly island,shoals,smith island,southern environmental law center,political,general news,transport,banking,credit,financial services"}, {"content": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 closed at records, as investors anticipated low interest rates for the foreseeable future.Investors scooped up stocks and bonds Friday after weak data on U.S. retail sales and inflation suggested the Federal Reserve may be slow in raising interest rates and reducing its balance sheet.Stocks that pay out steady dividends rose, with gains by utilities companies and other bond proxies in the S&P 500 offsetting a drop in shares of financial companies that followed a number of bank-earnings reports.The S&P 500 rose 11.44 points, or 0.5%, to 2459.27, notching a weekly gain of 1.4%.

The bill would end the requirement that most people pay a penalty if they don\u2019t have insurance and phase out the enhanced federal funding for Medicaid in 31 states.GOP Sens.       Rand Paul       of Kentucky and       Susan Collins       of Maine have already said they won\u2019t support the measure, which means Mr. McConnell cannot afford to lose a single more Republican in order to get the 50-vote majority the legislation needs to pass. Vice President       Mike Pence       would break any tie. No Democrats are expected to support the GOP bill.The vote is a critical moment in Republicans\u2019 seven-year aim to repeal the Obama administration\u2019s signature health law. Its passage could set the stage for a House vote before the end of August. Mr. McConnell on Thursday released a revamped bill aimed to unite conservatives who want more of the ACA gutted and moderates concerned that Medicaid cuts would leave too many people uninsured.In a controversial move, Senate GOP leaders included a modified version of a proposal from Sen. Ted Cruz (R., Texas) that would allow insurers to sell cheaper plans that don\u2019t meet all the ACA regulations if they also offer ones that do.Insurers have worried that under the Cruz proposal, the health market would be split in two. Healthy and younger people would flock to cheaper, less comprehensive plans, while people with pre-existing conditions who need more comprehensive coverage could have to pay far more. That has alarmed centrist GOP senators who want to maintain protections for people with pre-existing conditions.And although conservatives sought the Cruz measure, its current version has left them divided because of a change in the way the market where people buy insurance when they don\u2019t get coverage on the job would be structured.Mr. Cruz\u2019s proposal initially allowed for two risk pools, one for older people and consumers with expensive medical conditions, and the other for younger and healthier people. But GOP leaders modified it so that the current bill only permits one, a move designed to help the proposal function better in insurance markets.In a single market, younger and healthier people help offset the costs of older and sicker people.Some conservatives, including Sen. Mike Lee (R., Utah), are concerned that having a single risk pool would force insurers to partially shift the costs of sicker customers enrolled in ACA plans onto healthy customers seeking cheaper plans, a central flaw of the ACA in his view that he hoped to subvert with Mr. Cruz\u2019s proposal.\u201cSen. Lee is concerned a single pool would undermine the goal of the consumer freedom act by not ending the cross subsidization\u201d of the two markets, said Conn Carroll, a spokesman for Mr. Lee, who is undecided on the bill.Rep. Mark Meadows (R., N.C.), chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, a group of roughly three dozen conservative House Republicans, has backed Mr. Cruz\u2019s measure but raised concerns over its altered version Friday.\u201cWith a single risk pool, we\u2019re making a government decision, but we\u2019re telling healthy people that they\u2019ve got to subsidize those that are not as healthy,\u201d he said.Mr. Cruz defended the provision Friday, saying that it would help \u201cmillions and millions of people\u201d by making it possible for them to buy lower-cost coverage that favors lower-risk individuals, including with health-savings account pretax dollars, which, in turn, he said, would boost insurance pools overall.\u201cThe central focus of this discussion and the key to uniting Republicans is lowering premiums,\u201d he said.Meanwhile, some centrist Republican senators continue to have misgivings around the revised bill\u2019s deep cuts to Medicaid, a concern also shared by a number of Republican governors who are putting pressure on their senators.\u201cThe Senate bill is still unacceptable,\u201d Republican Ohio Governor John Kasich said Friday in a statement. GOP Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio has said he is still undecided on the revised bill.Pressure is mounting on Sen. Dean Heller (R., Nev.), whose support Mr. McConnell needs to pass the bill. Mr. Heller, who is up for re-election next year, said he would vote no on the bill\u2019s earlier version, which was also opposed by Nevada\u2019s GOP Gov.

After the short seller released its report, the company\u2019s share price plunged, causing billions of dollars in investor losses. One was American billionaire       John Paulson,        whose hedge fund lost about $500 million on the bet.The commission\u2019s decision says the company\u2019s founder, Allen Chan, was the guiding mind behind a series of schemes involving suppliers and other companies to engineer falsified revenue and asset statements. Three Sino-Forest executives\u2014Albert Ip, Alfred Hung and George Ho\u2014participated in the fraud, the regulator said.The securities commission is to hold a hearing next month to consider regulatory sanctions against Mr. Chan and other executives, which could include penalties or bans from senior roles at public companies traded on Canadian exchanges.It\u2019s not clear whether a fine could be collected from the Chinese executives.\u200bThe Ontario Securities Commission says on its website that recoveries of monetary sanctions can be limited, for example, if regulatory targets live outside the province or personal assets are difficult to trace.The regulator said that in one quarter in 2009, Mr. Chan was involved in 450 timber sales and purchases with \u201cno economic substance\u201d that overstated Sino-Forest\u2019s revenue by $30 million.Emily Cole, a lawyer for Mr. Chan, who resides in Hong Kong, said he \u201cis obviously disappointed with the outcome.\u201d She said her client is reviewing his options. A lawyer for Messrs Ip, Hung and Ho declined to comment. The location of the three men is not known.The regulator dismissed fraud allegations against a fifth Sino-Forest executive, Simon Yeung, the former vice president of operations for the defunct company. A lawyer for Mr. Yeung declined to comment.One of the many companies controlled by Mr. Chan, according to the ruling, was a supplier that was asked in emails by a Sino-Forest executive to build a structure with a fixed address so \u201cit looks like a company with substance.\u201d At the time of the email, Sino-Forest had already recorded $179.6 million of contracts with the supplier, the regulator said.Sino-Forest\u2019s sudden downfall was triggered by the scathing report from Muddy Waters in 2011. The firm looks into a variety of global businesses and engages in short selling of companies it believes to be overvalued. Shares of Sino-Forest plunged more than 60% in the following week and by 2012 the company sought bankruptcy protection. Its assets were eventually sold.Sino-Forest disputed the short seller\u2019s report and appointed a committee of independent directors to investigate the allegations. The Ontario Securities Commission said in its ruling that some of the directors traveled to remote corners of China to verify Sino-Forest\u2019s timber holdings, but they were stymied in their investigation after they failed to gain access to detailed maps or reliable government officials.Carson Block, the author of the Muddy Waters report, said in a statement that he \u201capplauded\u201d the regulator\u2019s decision following \u201ca good deal of hostility\u201d from former Sino-Forest officials about his report.Sino-Forest was one of a wave of Chinese companies that secured listings on North American stock exchanges through so-called reverse mergers in the early 2000s. The transaction allowed companies to trade publicly on U.S. and Canadian exchanges without the rigorous regulatory scrutiny that comes with initial public offerings.Write to Jacquie McNish at Jacquie.McNish@wsj.comAppeared in the July 15, 2017, print edition as 'Canadian Agency Flags Fraud At Chinese Timber Company.'", "news_time": "2017-07-14 19:08:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/sino-forest-accused-of-fraud-by-canada-regulator-1500048098", "news_title": "Sino-Forest Executives Committed Fraud in Overstating Value, Canadian Regulator Says   ", "keywords": "sino-forest accusations,sino-forest canada,sino-forest fraud,Ontario Securities Commission,Sino-Forest,Emily Cole,Albert Ip,Allen Chan,George Ho,Alfred Hung,corporate crime,legal action,regulation,government policy,regulatory bodies,bankruptcy,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,corporate financial difficulty,political,general news,crime,fraud,agriculture,forestry,logging"}, {"content": "Canada is working toward cutting a deal with the U.S. to end the latest trade row over lumber before it enters into talks to revamp the North American Free-Trade Agreement, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Friday.His comments in Providence, R.I., while attending a gathering of U.S. governors, suggests Ottawa doesn\u2019t want the lumber dispute to pose a fresh, insurmountable hurdle once Nafta renegotiations begin, as early as mid-August.\u201cThere\u2019s constant back and forth on this issue, and this is certainly one where both sides have indicated that we want to settle before we start on the Nafta negotiations, and we are going to work very hard towards that,\u201d Mr. Trudeau said at a press conference late Friday.This marks the first time Mr. Trudeau or any Canadian official has set a date as to when they would like a resolution to the current incarnation of U.S.-Canada lumber-trade dispute.On the sidelines of the governors\u2019 meeting, Mr. Trudeau met with Vice President       Mike Pence,        in which the two discussed \u201cthe shared importance\u201d of Nafta, according to a summary of the meeting released by Mr. Trudeau\u2019s office.The Trump administration has slapped two sets of duties on Canadian-produced softwood lumber, used mostly in the construction of homes, reaching as high as 30% on some products.The U.S. accuses Canada of unfairly selling its lumber in the U.S. below production costs, and providing subsidies to its domestic producers. The Canadian government has repeatedly said there is no merit in the U.S. accusations.In 2016, the U.S. imported over $5 billion worth of Canadian softwood lumber.Commerce Department Secretary       Wilbur Ross       has said the decadeslong disagreements over softwood lumber illustrate the shortcomings of Nafta.Trade watchers have warned letting the current lumber row drag on threatens to cast a pall over trilateral talks between the U.S., Canadaand Mexico for a revamped Nafta, by introducing a complex issue into negotiations. Lumber trade between the U.S. and Canada isn\u2019t covered under Nafta.The bulk of wood used to produce Canadian softwood lumber comes from forests on publicly owned land. Canada\u2019s provincial governments, which have responsibility over forest management, charge private companies a fee in exchange for the right to harvest. This U.S. government and lumber industry has long complained about this setup, saying the fees charged are significantly lower than they would be in an open-market environment\u2014and hence gives Canadian producers an unfair advantage over their U.S. peers.Mr. Ross and Canadian officials have said the two sides are looking at a resolution, although Canadian Foreign Minister       Chrystia Freeland       previously said the two sides are \u201cfar apart.\u201dIn a report to clients this week, analysts at CIBC World Markets said there was a \u201cgreater than 50% probability\u201d the two sides could come to a deal next month, based on their conversations with forest-industry contacts.In June, Mr. Ross said he was \u201coptimistic\u201d Washington and Ottawa could reach a negotiated solution on lumber. \u201cUntil we do we,\u201d he said, \u201cwe will continue to vigorously apply\u2026laws to stand up for American companies and their workers.\u201dWrite to Paul Vieira at paul.vieira@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-14 19:07:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/canadas-trudeau-eyes-lumber-deal-with-u-s-1500073664", "news_title": "Canada\u2019s Trudeau Eyes Lumber Deal With U.S. ", "keywords": "canada,lumber,nafta,trade,trade deal,trade talks,external payments,physical trade,economic news,political,general news,international relations,politics,domestic politics"}, {"content": "The parent of website Ashley Madison has reached a proposed settlement in a class-action suit related to a data breach which exposed vast amounts of information stolen from the dating site for those looking for extramarital affairs, according to court papers.Ruby Corp., the company behind the Ashley Madison website won\u2019t admit wrongdoing but will pay $11.2 million to compensate any losses of U.S. residents who used the website on or before July 20, 2015, when the company confirmed threats that the real names and personal preferences of the site\u2019s millions of users would be published unless Ashley Madison were shut down, according to the terms of the deal, filed Friday in St. Louis federal court.While the actual number of victims isn\u2019t known, the company estimates a target group of nearly six million people, according to court documents.A hearing on the proposed settlement has been scheduled for July 21.Ruby, as the company has since rebranded itself from Avid Life Media Inc., had previously settled related complaints filed by the Federal Trade Commission and several states.Ruby has said it no longer uses so-called fembots\u2014computer programs that disguise themselves as female customers to lure men to the site\u2014and has improved data security and updated practices regarding personal information of users who are inactive or have deactivated their accounts.The site\u2014which still uses the motto \u201cLife is short.

But hell doesn\u2019t have as many circles of dysfunction, and the root cause is the political misallocation of resources.Hundreds of trains that run through New York City will be delayed or diverted this summer so Amtrak can make long overdue track repairs at Penn Station, the busiest rail hub in North America. Derailments are now common, and New York\u2019s subways are also breaking down. The mess is a mere portent of the misery that commuters will experience when the 107-year-old tunnel under the Hudson River, which was badly damaged by Hurricane Sandy in 2012, undergoes repairs.Liberal politicians extol the virtues of public transit, so why can\u2019t they run a decent public railroad? The answer is that modern progressives prefer doling out transfer payments to voters and public workers rather than make long-term investments in subway cars, tunnels and bridges. And even when they do build something, they pile on the costs to pay off their other political constituencies.Take the Hudson tunnel retrofit, which the Federal Railroad Administration\u2019s (FRA) draft environmental impact statement last week pegged at $13 billion, up from $7.7 billion from just last year. Cost drivers include measures to minimize traffic delays, but also defensive contracting to avoid lawsuits. The FRA proposes blocking ugly views of construction with barricades and fencing that are \u201cclad with aesthetically attractive or artistically enhanced fabric.\u201d Marsh-pennywort plants in the Meadowlands would be transplanted to protected areas.The FRA and New Jersey Transit had to make such concessions to get an alphabet soup of agencies\u201429 participated in the study\u2014to issue the 19 permits required. Tunnel construction is planned to start in 2019 and wrap up by 2026, if you choose to believe.New York\u2019s Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) spent 45 years and $4.5 billion building the two-mile Second Avenue subway, which was first proposed in the 1920s. In 1999 the East Side Access project to bring Long Island Railroad trains into Grand Central was estimated to cost $4.3 billion. The MTA now expects to complete it by 2023 for $10.8 billion.Political demands drive up costs and create delays. New Jersey politicians wanted the World Trade Center Transportation Hub to be an architectural masterpiece. Their counterparts in Staten Island didn\u2019t want to inconvenience ferry riders by temporarily closing the 1 subway line. This is how a train station that serves a mere 46,000 daily commuters\u2014less than 10% of Penn Station\u2019s traffic\u2014wound up costing $4 billion.Then there are labor agreements. The 1931 Davis-Bacon Act requires public projects receiving federal funds to pay prevailing wages typically determined by unions. Work rules stipulate how many and which workers must perform specific tasks. Inefficiency is rewarded with overtime.The Federal Transit Act also requires federal grant recipients to protect workers against a \u201cworsening\u201d of their employment condition. This in effect bars transit agencies from contracting out services, reducing benefits or laying off workers. The Department of Labor looks to unions to certify that agencies are upholding the law, which increases their clout in collective bargaining.Since 2005 the MTA\u2019s labor costs\u2014which account for 60% of expenses\u2014have swelled by 80%. Pension and health costs have doubled. In January the agency bumped pay by an additional 5% over the next two years, threw in a $500 bonus and agreed to hire 100 workers to remodel worker facilities.With all the money that government spends on labor and marsh-pennyworts, it\u2019s no surprise that capital investment has been neglected. The MTA\u2019s rolling stock hasn\u2019t been replaced for 20 to 30 years since Mayors       Ed Koch       and       Rudy Giuliani       prioritized service improvements. The MTA still uses block signals from the 1930s, which explains why so many are malfunctioning and causing delays. While the current capital plan allocates $2.8 billion to modernize the signal system, the upgrade won\u2019t be finished for half a century.Progressives say we don\u2019t spend enough on public works, but dedicated taxes for New York\u2019s MTA have doubled over the last decade. Washington is spending 35% more on public transit than a decade ago. Don\u2019t forget the $11 billion that the Northeast got from Hurricane Sandy relief for transportation, which should have covered the cost for signal repairs. But politicians instead prioritized spending $15.9 billion for \u201ccommunity development\u201d and billions more in pork. As taxes rise most of the money goes to buying votes rather than upgrades that will be finished on some other politician\u2019s watch.The heyday for American public works came before the political dominance of public unions and the welfare state.

BRK.B 0.52%       boss and Mr. Malone, whose             Liberty Broadband Corp.

The talks are at an early stage and may not result in an agreement, the people said, but one possibility would see Berkshire put more than $10 billion into a transaction.Mr. Son, who controls more than 80% of Sprint, has been exploring a deal to help the money-losing company which is saddled with more than $32 billion in debt. In recent months, Sprint has also held merger talks with rival             T-Mobile US Inc.       and discussed a reseller agreement with cable providers, people familiar with the matter have said.Sprint shares gained 4% Friday after The Wall Street Journal reported the discussions, ending the day with a market capitalization of about $34 billion.Since late May, Charter and             Comcast Corp.have been in exclusive talks with Sprint about buying a stake in the wireless carrier or negotiating a favorable wholesale agreement that would allow them to resell wireless service under their own cable brands. The exclusivity window only lasts a few more weeks, people familiar with the matter have said.Mr. Malone has been scouting for a deal that would bolster Charter\u2019s efforts to add wireless service to its cable TV and internet businesses, people familiar with the matter say.Charter and Comcast struck a wireless partnership earlier this year, agreeing to seek the other\u2019s consent on any wireless deal. Charter would need Comcast\u2019s approval to reach any such deal with Sprint or Mr. Buffett, but Mr. Malone\u2019s Liberty Broadband Corp. wouldn\u2019t if it were to act independently.Comcast CEO Brian Roberts has been wary of buying into Sprint, people familiar with the matter have said. Comcast has more diversified holdings in entertainment and theme parks, and views the wireless business as an industry under great price competition. It has instead opted for a more cautious approach, using a reseller deal with             Verizon Communications Inc.       to add wireless to its bundle of services for Comcast customers.Messrs. Buffett and Malone have a history together and both are known for investing in companies that others view as distressed. Sprint, which has been unprofitable since Mr. Son took control of it in 2013 and fallen to No. 4 in terms of U.S. subscribers, fits that bill.Mr. Buffett has invested in some of Mr. Malone\u2019s companies in the past, including Charter and international cable operator             Liberty Global                   PLC. Berkshire Hathaway currently holds 3.5% of Class A shares in Charter and 8.5% of Class A shares in Liberty Global, making it Liberty Global\u2019s largest Class A shareholder.Berkshire held more than $90 billion in cash at the end of the first quarter, and Mr. Buffett has been on the hunt for deals. Berkshire\u2019s utility unit agreed earlier this month to buy bankrupt Energy Future Holdings Corp.\u2019s Oncor for around $18 billion, including debt.Mr. Buffett has traditionally avoided technology companies, though Berkshire owns a stake in             Apple Inc.       and until recently held a large stake in Verizon. One cable industry veteran likened a potential Buffett investment in cable\u2019s wireless efforts as a vote of confidence similar to what cable experienced when             Microsoft Corp.       plunged $1 billion into Comcast in 1997 to juice high-speed broadband deployment.An investment would help Sprint invest in its network and afford price cuts to drive customer growth. But it could complicate merger talks with T-Mobile and its parent company,             Deutsche Telekom AG      . Those talks, which restarted this year, were put on hold while Sprint and its parent company, Japan-based             SoftBank Group Corp.      , agreed to the exclusive talks with Charter and Comcast.\u2014Dana Mattioli and Nicole Friedman contributed to this articleCorrections & Amplifications   An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated Charter Communications Inc.\u2019s name as Charter Communications Corp.Write to Ryan Knutson at ryan.knutson@wsj.com and Shalini Ramachandran at shalini.ramachandran@wsj.comAppeared in the July 15, 2017, print edition as 'Sprint Dials Up Buffett, Malone.'", "news_time": "2017-07-14 18:13:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/sprint-executives-have-engaged-warren-buffett-about-investment-1500055560", "news_title": "Sprint\u2019s Chairman Has Engaged Warren Buffett About Investment ", "keywords": "buffett,investment,Berkshire Hathaway,BRKA,Charter Communications ,CHTR,Liberty Broadband Corp.

We always assumed that it would be somebody like       Carter Page       who\u2019d eventually be discovered to have participated in an ill-advised email chain showing that even Team       Trump       noticed the Hindenburg-size fact of Russian delight in the Trump phenomenon.Now the press has its gotcha, and it\u2019s Donald Trump Jr. Golly.Yet, after the first flush of hysteria, Don Jr. may be only half a rube for not being more sensitive to the Russian connection, which would explode in Hindenburg fashion only with the DNC email hack a few days later.Bloomberg News suggests that Russian lawyer       Natalia Veselnitskaya       wasn\u2019t bringing secrets gleaned from Russia\u2019s \u201ccrown prosecutor,\u201d but news she read in the Russian press. Not the Russians but a Russian was trying to peddle this info to Trump Tower, as a pretext to lobby on behalf of a wealthy Russian client.And it wasn\u2019t any Russian but a tubby British music publicist who babbled fourth-hand, or perhaps was apple polishing all on his own, in claiming \u201cRussian government support\u201d for the Trump effort.The farcical element continues to predominate in Russiagate, including with the mostly ignored Russian influence on FBI chief       James Comey\u2019s       actions.But real trouble can flow even from a farce. Thinkers for whom Russia was just one problem in a world full of problems, who previously did not identify Moscow as the No. 1 enemy, now do so, vociferously, for fear of being lumped in with Mr. Trump as a traitor to America or some such.A mob is a machine for mass-producing cowards and bullies. That\u2019s where we are now. Just turn on cable TV.Even the estimable       Anne Applebaum,        author of a book on the Soviet gulag, fulminates in the Washington Post against every recent president for failing to heed Russia\u2019s \u201cpeculiar dangers.\u201d With all due respect, U.S. presidents are better informed than anybody about the nature of the Russian regime. They read the intelligence.       George W. Bush       looked in Mr. Putin\u2019s eyes and didn\u2019t see his soul. He saw a potential nightmare that would have to be managed somehow. Ditto President       Obama.But neither are U.S. presidents equipped with magical powers to make such facts go away. The world is stuck with Mr. Putin, an authoritarian who cannot afford to modernize, whose quest for survival inevitably drives him down a funnel of deepening hostility toward a superpower where the rule of law prevails.In the U.S. election, what began as Mr. Putin\u2019s vendetta against Hillary morphed into his cynical promotion of Mr. Trump, and now is coming up roses a third time as a way to discredit the U.S. government and its new president.A respected Russian journalist,       Mikhail Zygar,        in the New Yorker, dismisses the idea of some Putin \u201cmaster plan. .\u00a0.\u00a0. There is no plan\u2014it\u2019s chaos.\u201dAnother, Roman Shleinov, apropos of supposed payoffs to Mr. Trump via his real-estate business, explains that it has nothing to do with Trump: \u201cMoney is fleeing Russia in all directions, people are trying to invest anywhere they can, to get their assets out.\u201dIf there was a conspiracy to put a Trump in the White House, let\u2019s face it, Don Jr. would never have been fielding a blind email about it in June 2016 from a       Miss Universe       hanger-on.Here\u2019s another secret: Most U.S. reporters know they are overplaying the Trump-Russia connection, even as they revel in the Don Jr. gotcha moment, even as they play up the circus of legal and political jeopardy the administration has created for itself.That is, except for       John Harwood       of CNBC for whom the Don Jr. revelations on Tuesday explained everything\u2014everything. President Trump\u2019s every word and deed, he argued on-air, must now be understood as payback to Russia for helping him get elected.Uh huh. One lesson voters may have to stick in their back pocket from all this: The U.S. can\u2019t afford a president with as much baggage as Mr. Trump, even if there\u2019s a lot to be said for opening up the elite to fresh, more-lively blood.Another lesson concerns the people who used to be called editors and were played in the movies by       Jason Robards.       If there was ever a need to rein in the supercritical hysteria that the websites of the             New York Times                   and the Washington Post and MSNBC on-air feed when their competitive dander is up, Tuesday showed it.To their credit, all three have since calmed down. Or maybe it\u2019s post-coital lassitude. (Mr. Harwood is probably virtually comatose from it.) Scoops are overrated\u2014the public is not worse for learning the news at 6:30 p.m. instead of 11:30 a.m., especially if somebody with a brain has had a chance to reflect on its presentation. At least scoops are overrated in every way except in the race for clicks, which we\u2019re guessing played a bigger role in this week\u2019s Don Jr. bacchanal than any news organization would be proud to admit.Appeared in the July 15, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-07-14 18:10:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/on-don-jr-the-media-cant-help-itself-1500070224", "news_title": "On Don Jr., the Media Can\u2019t Help Itself", "keywords": " 2016 election, clinton, collusion,don jr, russia, trump, white house,corporate,industrial news,commentaries,opinions"}, {"content": "With one unfortunate exception, The Wall Street Journal has always adhered to co-founder       Charles Dow\u2019s       injunction against endorsing political candidates. The exception came in 1928 with an editorial, ordered up by the dying Dow Jones & Co. president,       C.W. Barron,        that endorsed Republican       Herbert Hoover.       Barron apparently feared that the election of Democratic New York Gov.       Al Smith       would undo the economic achievements of his good friend       Calvin Coolidge.What Barron didn\u2019t seem to realize was that although Hoover was a Republican, he was not cut from the same cloth as Coolidge or       William Howard Taft.       His penchant for market interventions was almost as intense as what would later be displayed by the New Deal Democrats. Having endorsed Hoover, the Journal\u2019s editorials were rather muted in offering criticisms of his performance, a timidity that vindicated Dow\u2019s warning that a good newspaper should never tie itself to a politician of either party.The Journal\u2019s free-market principles were violated when Hoover bowed to heavy lobbying by farmers and industry and signed the notorious Hawley-Smoot Tariff Act of 1930, one of the greatest protective tariff increases in American history. When the nation\u2019s trading partners retaliated in kind, Hawley-Smoot brought about a virtual shutdown in world trade, hitting American farmers, who accounted for a large share of American exports, hardest of all. That, along with the hapless Fed\u2019s inability to arrest deflation, worsened the Depression. A petition signed by 1,028 leading economists urged Hoover to veto the measure, to no avail. Under heavy political pressure from protectionists, he ignored their advice.Republicans were excessively committed to their efforts to \u201chelp\u201d the farmer. A Journal editorial on April 15, 1930, probably written by Frederick Korsmeyer and titled \u201cA Tariff Banquo,\u201d attacked a proposed export subsidy for farmers that Sen.       William Edgar Borah       (R., Idaho) wanted in the Hawley-Smoot bill. The editorial likened the provision to Banquo\u2019s ghost in that it popped up repeatedly in Congress and was hard to banish. The editorial calculated that for cotton alone, the provision would cost the Treasury $80 million a year, and the subsidy would also defeat efforts by the government to curb crop acreage to support prices of farm products. Farmers would respond by increasing their production with the \u201ccertainty of a future collapse making their condition worse than ever.\u201dMore generally, the Journal said on April 1, 1930, that the \u201cpending tariff bill has been constructed on the good old theory that this country can make its own living standards and let the rest of the world roll by.\u201d The editorial challenged the popular idea (still existent today but more dangerous then) that an export surplus, enforced by high tariffs, is a good thing for the economy. It cited a book titled \u201cAmerica Looks Abroad\u201d by banker-economist       Paul Mazur       about the fundamental inconsistency of that view.Said the editorial: \u201cAmerica looks abroad, wrote Mazur, because she can\u2019t help herself. She seeks an answer to the not altogether new question how she may continue to collect $1,000,000,000 of annual interest on foreign loans and still preserve a merchandise export balance of nearly as much. With due conditions and qualifications, Mr. Mazur\u2019s conclusion is that it cannot be done.\u201dThis editorial was not the first and would not be the last time that the Journal would have to point out that the flip side of an export surplus is a foreign investment deficit. Americans in the 1930s frequently grumbled over the failure of our European Allies to pay their World War I debts. Mazur and the Journal were pointing out that high tariffs made it difficult for the Europeans to earn the dollars to make those payments, even with the best of intentions.The damage from Hawley-Smoot, which Hoover signed in June, wasn\u2019t long in coming. A Journal editorial on Dec. 30, 1930, noted that exports of autos and parts for the 10 months ending in October had dropped to $249 million from $488 million in the like period a year earlier. \u201cThis is not an isolated instance but is only one of many of our export trade. When there is a great falling off of foreign demand for the products of labor, whether cotton or machinery, there must be a falling off in employment that reacts upon all industry and trade,\u201d said the Journal.The Journal was notably cool toward Hoover\u2019s 1931 State of the Union address, criticizing him for a lack of leadership in signing Hawley-Smoot. An editorial said the message was \u201cin fact disappointing,\u201d betraying Hoover as \u201ca man whose mental vision is apt to become focused on what he wishes to see.\u201dAs the Depression deepened, the Journal\u2019s support for Hoover waned further, and although it still leaned toward Hoover over       Franklin D. Roosevelt       in the 1932 presidential race, there were no more enthusiastic endorsements. The Journal\u2019s editorial position was equivocal, deeming both parties to be, in effect, antibusiness. Indeed, an editorial on July 1, 1932, favored the Democrat platform plank as being the \u201cmost honest\u201d on the repeal of Prohibition, which, even in the depths of a Depression, it described as the \u201cmost important issue facing the nation.\u201dThe biggest thing we did in the 1970s and \u201980s under editor       Bob Bartley\u2019s       leadership was to provide a springboard for what later came to be called the \u201csupply-side revolution\u201d in economic thought. We didn\u2019t know when we entered into this project that it would be the big deal it proved to be, transforming federal economic policy in a way that made the United States more prosperous and life better for many millions of Americans.The early supply-siders of the 1970s advocated cutting rates in the highest-income tax brackets, in what was then an even more progressive system than now. As a worker\u2019s earnings rose, he paid out ever-higher percentages of additional (marginal) income to the tax collector; thus, the system penalized the most productive and successful taxpayers. I was Bob\u2019s deputy, and initially I was not sure that cutting rates on the highest incomes, as the supply-siders advocated, would create greater incentives to produce. I was concerned that they were simply offering a way to make the rich even richer, an argument that has not gone away even today.But a better understanding of what the supply-siders were driving at revealed the logic of their arguments. Men and women will work harder to improve their status in life if the work effort they expend and the investment risks they take are not burdened with excessive taxation. In other words, supply-side measures were not meant to help the rich, but to foster the work effort and investment of time and money by people who want to become rich, or at least richer. In short, they were advocating measures to promote economic growth, which improves the lot of almost everyone.It made sense to me because of the experience of my own family. Long before I was born, my father owned a farm on the eastern outskirts of Louisville, Ky. It was on the south bank of the mighty Ohio River, and every spring his land was inundated by Ohio\u2019s annual flood. After the danger of flood had passed, my father cleared his land of debris and planted sweet corn. When it matured, he harvested the \u201croasting ears\u201d and hauled them into Louisville to sell at the farmers\u2019 market. It was a profitable business. Eventually, he saved enough money to buy a better farm in central Indiana and enjoy a measure of prosperity of the 1920s.My father, beginning with very little capital, was able to build a profitable business through long hours of hard physical labor. There was no farm program to support him, but on the other hand he wasn\u2019t overburdened with excessive taxes and regulation. He could use what he earned at the Louisville market to support his wife and six children (I was later to be the eighth and last) and still have savings left over for future investment in a better farm that wasn\u2019t flooded every spring. Because of his productivity, he was able to earn a surplus by supplying a marketable commodity to the townspeople of Louisville.Men like my father, questing for a better life and willing to work long, hard hours to achieve that end, supplied the productive energy that built the United States to the powerful engine it had become by the 1920s. The country\u2019s reputation as a land of opportunity, where privileged elites could not keep a good man down, had drawn many millions of ambitious immigrants to America\u2019s shores, and does to this day. There had to be demand in the marketplace for what they produced, of course, but it was their productive labor that drove the economy.My father, along with millions of other Americans, demonstrated the simple principles that formed the foundation for supply-side economics. People produce so as to be able to consume, and they work harder and take more risks if there are few restrictions on their opportunity for gain.Associate editor       Jude Wanniski,        Bob Bartley and I used to amuse ourselves imagining the guesses readers might be making\u2014particularly our adversaries\u2014about the backgrounds of the men who were writing Wall Street Journal editorials. The class-warfare barbs thrown at us by our critics on the left led us to believe that they thought we were pampered sons of New York billionaires. In fact, Bob\u2019s father taught veterinary medicine at Iowa State; I grew up in a farm village in Indiana, the son of a farmer; and Jude was the son of a coal miner and grandson of an ardent Communist.We were a rather proletarian lot to be promoting capitalism, but we were not at all out of step with the special brand of populism that had been made a tradition by our predecessor Journal editorial page writers. \u201cFree people, free markets\u201d was in our veins for the simple reason that those principles allowed upward mobility for individuals with energy and ambition\u2014people like us. Business leaders, when they departed from those principles\u2014as they often did\u2014were as much fair game for our verbal arrows as statist politicians. We were not the \u201cvoice of big business,\u201d as our critics glibly called us, but exponents of free-market capitalism, an economic system that allows any individual to build a business and compete with the big boys.The two things are definitely not the same. We didn\u2019t expect limousine liberals to love us for our proletarian origins. Distrust of self-made men is a fairly common attitude in those circles. A few of us were having lunch with former managing editor       Barney Kilgore       in Cleveland once when he offered what I thought was a particularly trenchant observation about rich liberals: \u201cThey\u2019ve got theirs and they don\u2019t want anyone else to get any.\u201dThe fundamental importance of encouraging production was understood as well by       Ronald Reagan,        a poor boy from the Illinois sticks. Reagan defeated       Jimmy Carter       in 1980, partly because of the hash Carter had made of economic policy. After Reagan took office, tight money forced the nation into a sharp but short-lived recession, which gave rise to some carping, even among some supply-siders, that Reagan had misapplied their principles.Whatever the right policy mix might have been, when the recession ended in 1983, the country came out of it with a dollar rehabilitated to relative soundness and a tax system that had restored incentives to work and invest. On that basis the United States would enjoy steady economic growth, with only two brief exceptions, well into the 21st century.The supply-side formula had been proved correct. Ronald Reagan had pushed aside all the old class-warfare, soak-the-rich populism that had taken hold in the 1930s and had restored the kind of free-enterprise populism that had made the United States great.Mr. Melloan is a former deputy editor of the Journal editorial page and author of \u201cFree People, Free Markets: How the Wall Street Journal Opinion Pages Shaped America,\u201d just out from Encounter, from which this article is adapted.Appeared in the July 15, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-07-14 18:09:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/protectionism-vs-free-market-populism-1500070147", "news_title": "Protectionism vs. Free-Market Populism", "keywords": " dow jones, economic policy, hawley, herbert hoover, protectionism, ronald reagan, smoot, supply side, tariff,the wall street journal, trumpism, wsj,marketing,markets,corporate,industry exports,industrial news,trade,external payments,economic news,political,general news,international relations,politics,domestic politics,tariffs,trade barriers,elections,national,presidential elections,commentaries,opinions"}, {"content": "Two hundred years ago this Tuesday\u2014July 18, 1817\u2014the beloved novelist       Jane Austen       died at 41 in Winchester, England. That her era is not our own is part of the attraction. Hollywood\u2019s Austen adaptations, more than 70 and counting for film and television, beguile with elegance, manners, green countryside, candlelit balls, handsomely dressed ladies and gentlemen\u2014and, of course, romance.Alas, this pleasant vision of Austenworld gets it all wrong, as literary critics insist they have discovered. Far from celebrating the genteel society presented in her novels, Austen was an angry subversive who \u201crepeatedly demonstrates her alienation from the aggressively patriarchal tradition,\u201d according to an influential feminist study from 1979, \u201cThe Madwoman in the Attic.\u201dAnother critic, who wrote a book on Austen\u2019s novel \u201cPersuasion,\u201d exults in an interview that its heroine has \u201cfew options in the repressive society of her time\u201d yet still \u201cescapes from the toxic systems of rank and gender that control her woman\u2019s life.\u201d Curiously, she escapes by marrying a man she has doted on for eight years.An academic journal article from 2015 expands on a humorous exchange about muslin in \u201cNorthanger Abbey,\u201d explaining that Austen \u201cshows dress to be bound up in the larger structures of British imperialism and gender politics\u2014both as a spoil of imperial exploitation and as a trapping of femininity that underscores the commodification of women in the marriage market.\u201dFrom the cloudy heights, academic jargon trickles down to street level. A paperback edition of \u201cSense and Sensibility\u201d touts its \u201cpowerful analysis of the ways in which women\u2019s lives were shaped by the claustrophobic society in which they had to survive.\u201d So much for romance.We might better mark this bicentennial by revisiting Jane Austen in her own time, without nostalgia or reinvention. She grew up in the crowded rectory of a rural village. Never married, she remained close to her many brothers and beloved sister, Cassandra. Her circle otherwise comprised local gentry and a maze of aunts, uncles, in-laws, nieces, nephews and cousins.All fell under her quick observation. In one letter to Cassandra, Austen describes a guest at the ball she attended as having a \u201cbroad face, diamond bandeau, white shoes, pink husband, & fat neck.\u201d In another letter, a local clergyman is said to appear \u201cin such very deep mourning that either his Mother, his Wife, or himself must be dead.\u201dAlthough Austen was a keen reader, she had no intellectual pretensions; she played popular tunes on the piano but lacked strong interest in music or art. After visiting a museum and gallery, she reports that \u201cI had some amusement at each, tho\u2019 my preference for Men & Women always inclines me to attend more to the company than the sight.\u201dRather than betray alienation, her surviving correspondence\u2014mostly to Cassandra\u2014talks of fabrics, caps and pelisses (a type of woman\u2019s cloak); social calls, dinners, and balls; the weather; her mother\u2019s health; and people\u2014often dozens of names. In her 30s, she remarked of a ball: \u201cIt was the same room in which we danced 15 years ago!\u2014I thought it all over\u2014& inspite of the shame of being so much older, felt with Thankfulness that I was quite as happy now as then.\u201dAusten\u2019s assumptions were old-fashioned Tory, her political interests slight. Her novels dramatize not social ills, but individual failings: vanity, greed, pride, selfishness, arrogance, folly. For all her humor and wit, she was a rigorous moralist. Adult life demanded adult behavior: self-awareness, propriety, kindness, good sense. The admirable Colonel Brandon of \u201cSense and Sensibility\u201d is described as \u201cundoubtedly a sensible man, and in his manners perfectly the gentleman.\u201d Listening to the chatter of a fatuous fop, the heroine Elinor \u201cagreed to it all, for she did not think he deserved the compliment of rational opposition.\u201dThough making extended visits to London and living for several years in Bath and Southhampton, Austen, like her character       Marianne Dashwood,        \u201csighed for the air, the liberty, the quiet of the country.\u201d Yet the world she knew\u2014\u201cthree or four Families in a Country Village,\u201d as she puts it in one letter\u2014offered more than enough of human character, high and low, to constitute a moral microcosm. Urged to aim higher, to write a serious historical romance, she replied firmly: \u201cNo\u2014I must keep to my own style & go on in my own way.\u201dThat was enough for Austen, and for 200 years it has been enough for readers. But a book out this past May, \u201cJane Austen, the Secret Radical\u201d reveals that her novels \u201cdeal with slavery, sexual abuse, land enclosure, evolution, and women\u2019s rights.\u201d The evidence? \u201cI offer flashes of an imaginary Jane Austen,\u201d the critic admits, \u201cglimpses of what the authoress might have been thinking.\u201dWhat might she be thinking today of her rebirth as a discontented oracle bristling with progressive opinions? Out of politeness to the literary theorists, she might adapt a line she used on her sister. \u201cI will not say that your Mulberry trees are dead,\u201d she once told Cassandra, \u201cbut I am afraid they are not alive.\u201dMr. Garnett is a professor of English literature at Gettysburg College.Appeared in the July 15, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-07-14 18:08:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-pride-and-prejudice-of-21st-century-literary-critics-1500070094", "news_title": "The Pride and Prejudice of 21st-Century Literary Critics", "keywords": " criticism, feminism,jane austen, literary theory, patriarchy, pride and prejudice, romance, secret radical, sense and sensibility,books,political,general news,arts,entertainment,politics,international relations,domestic politics,commentaries,opinions"}, {"content": "Texas is facing a bathroom emergency. Gov.       Greg Abbott       effectively has been forced to reconvene the state legislature Tuesday for a 30-day special session. What will likely dominate is an issue he has avoided all year: transgender access to public restrooms.The Texas business lobby doesn\u2019t want a repeat of the scene in North Carolina, and Mr. Abbott usually is attuned to its wishes. But he has been outflanked on this point by Lt. Gov.       Dan Patrick,        a conservative former talk-radio host with a knack for setting the state\u2019s agenda.Mr. Patrick has been pushing a bill that would require people in government facilities to use the bathroom corresponding to their biological sex. Like the ill-fated North Carolina law, it would also pre-empt local governments from regulating bathrooms in private facilities. The issue popped up last year when the Fort Worth school district announced a transgender accommodation policy that it later reversed under pressure.It might seem strange that the governor and lieutenant governor would be at loggerheads, but in Texas the two positions are elected separately and often filled by political rivals. Mr. Patrick, whose role includes presiding over the Texas Senate, is arguably the state\u2019s most powerful officeholder.But much of Mr. Patrick\u2019s agenda has been thwarted by the third member of the Texas triumvirate, House Speaker       Joe Straus,        a Republican moderate. Mr. Straus plays the foil to the state\u2019s conservatives, sending most of their bills off to die in committee. This rarely attracts attention beyond the grass roots, since Texas does its legislating in two-month bursts only every other year.Mr. Abbott straddles the two camps: He plays a fire-breather on Fox News but is otherwise cautious. When the bathroom bill arose, the governor was almost certainly counting on Mr. Straus to kill it in committee. But Mr. Patrick has now forced the issue by taking hostage the Texas Medical Board.Under the state\u2019s \u201csunset\u201d rules, agencies face theoretical elimination every few years unless the legislature endorses their work and extends their charters. This is generally a pro forma process: Does Texas really need three licensing boards for physical therapists? Apparently the answer, once again, is yes.Mr. Patrick spotted his opportunity late in the regular session, when, through a series of procedural machinations, the initiative for renewing the Texas Medical Board fell in his lap. He made clear he would refuse unless Mr. Straus put the bathroom bill to a vote. The regular legislative session ended May 29 with the board due to expire.Mr. Abbott was caught in the middle. So he called a special session to begin July 18, attempting to seize the initiative by announcing 20 priorities, among them the medical board and a vague call for bathroom \u201cprivacy.\u201d The others include a measure on tree-trimming ordinances, but these ostensible priorities seem to be little more than foliage.Texas governors have quite limited powers, but one of them is calling special sessions, so Mr. Abbott does have the last word here. His initial agenda covers only the sunset issue. He has said that he will expand it to cover the other 19 items as soon as the Senate renews the medical board. Mr. Patrick, in other words, has to surrender his leverage.Mr. Patrick still will get his day in the spotlight and a chance\u2014without the rush of the normal legislative session to distract\u2014to lament that Texas has a Republican speaker who doesn\u2019t much care for a lot of Republican ideas.Mr. Straus has survived eight years as leader by avoiding the spotlight, and polling shows most Texans have little idea who he is. State media, considering the alternatives, cover for him, rarely mentioning his political orientation or that he came to the speakership in a coup led by Democrats.So far, Mr. Straus appears determined to resist the public pressure.

That is the index\u2019s lowest close since Oct. 5.\u00a0The dollar fell 0.7% against the Japanese yen, 0.6% against\u00a0the euro and 1.2% against the British pound.The dollar, already down 5% this year, was driven lower Friday after disappointing inflation and retail sales\u00a0reports.A Labor Department report showed the consumer-price index, which measures what Americans pay for everything from ice cream to eye-doctor visits, was flat in June from the prior month. Excluding the often-volatile categories of food and energy, so-called core prices rose 0.1%, below the 0.2% gain expected by economists.The data is the latest sign that U.S. inflation remains stubbornly soft, a potential obstacle for the Fed\u2019s plans to continue lifting interest rates.In her semiannual congressional testimony this week, Fed Chairwoman       Janet Yellen       reiterated her view that the inflation slowdown is likely temporary.\u201cIt\u2019s premature to reach the judgment that we\u2019re not on the path to 2% inflation over the next couple of years,\u201d Ms. Yellen told lawmakers Wednesday. \u201cWe\u2019re watching this very closely and stand ready to adjust our policy if it appears that the inflation undershoot will be persistent.\u201dAnalysts at Capital Economics said Friday\u2019s inflation data makes it \u201charder for the Fed to continue claiming that this is a temporary drop off.\u201dU.S. retail sales data released Friday also disappointed.

But a top prosecutor said he couldn\u2019t explain the murders.\u201cI\u2019m not really sure if we could ever answer that question,\u201d Bucks County District Attorney       Matthew Weintraub       said at a news conference Friday.Cosmo Dinardo       is charged with criminal homicide in the killings of all four of the men.       Sean Kratz,        described as Mr. Dinardo\u2019s cousin, is charged in three deaths. Both men also face charges of abusing corpses, robbery and other counts.It wasn\u2019t immediately clear if Mr. Kratz had a lawyer.Mr. Dinardo confessed Thursday to murdering the four in rural Solebury Township north of Philadelphia, according to Mr. Dinardo\u2019s lawyer and prosecutors.In exchange for his confession, prosecutors promised not to seek the death penalty, said Mr. Dinardo\u2019s lawyer,       Paul Lang.       Mr. Weintraub said Friday he made the deal so Mr. Dinardo would lead them to the grave of one of the men, adding that it also yielded key information needed to charge Mr. Kratz.Prosecutors have said Mr. Dinardo has a history of severe mental illness and was once committed to a mental-health facility after firing a shotgun.The deadly shootings began on July 5, according to a police affidavit, when Mr. Dinardo shot 19-year-old       Jimi Patrick       and buried him on the Dinardo family\u2019s farm.Mr. Dinardo told investigators he agreed to sell Mr. Patrick four pounds of marijuana for $8,000, and drove him from his home to the Dinardo family farm, according to the affidavit. But Mr. Patrick didn\u2019t bring enough money so Mr. Dinardo agreed to sell him a shotgun instead. They then walked out to a remote part of the property where Mr. Dinardo killed Mr. Patrick with a .22 caliber rifle, court records say.The affidavit said Mr. Dinardo used a backhoe to dig a hole and bury Mr. Patrick\u2019s body, which authorities said they found late Thursday with information from Mr. Dinardo.Two days later, on July 7, Mr. Dinardo together with Mr. Kratz allegedly killed Dean Finocchiaro, 19;       Thomas Meo,        21; and Mark Sturgis, 22. Their bodies were found Wednesday in a 12 1/2-foot-deep common grave on another part of Dinardo family property, according to the district attorney\u2019s office.Mr. Dinardo told investigators he agreed to sell one-quarter of a pound of marijuana to Mr. Finocchiaro for roughly $700, according to the affidavit. On the way to Mr. Finocchiaro\u2019s home, Mr. Dinardo picked up Mr. Kratz, whom he told authorities was his cousin, and the pair made plans to rob Mr. Finocchiaro, the affidavit said.Back at the Dinardo property, Mr. Kratz shot Mr. Finocchiaro in the head with a .357 handgun belonging to Mr. Dinardo\u2019s mother as they were leaving a barn, the affidavit said, citing Mr. Dinardo\u2019s statement. Mr. Dinardo took the gun and shot the victim a second time as he lay on the ground. Mr. Kratz has a different version of the events and said it was Mr. Dinardo who shot Mr. Finocchiaro, the affidavit said.Later that day, Mr. Dinardo said he met the two other victims at a church parking lot near the farm to carry out a marijuana deal, court records show. The victims, Messrs. Meo and Sturgis, followed Mr. Dinardo to his family\u2019s property in Mr. Meo\u2019s car, and the two then rode in Mr. Dinardo\u2019s truck to an area where Mr. Kratz waited, the affidavit said.After the men got out of the truck, Mr. Dinardo told investigators, he shot Mr. Meo in the back and brought down the fleeing Mr. Sturgis with several gunshots, according to the affidavit.Mr. Dinardo then ran over Mr. Meo with the backhoe that he used to put both bodies inside a metal tank where he had earlier placed Mr. Finocchiaro\u2019s body. Mr. Dinardo then poured gasoline in the tank and set it on fire, according to the affidavit.On July 8, after Messrs. Dinardo and Kratz returned to the area, Mr. Dinardo dug the 12\u00bd-foot-deep hole with the backhoe and buried the tank that held the three corpses, the affidavit said.Write to Scott Calvert at scott.calvert@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-14 18:01:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/two-charged-in-killings-of-four-missing-pennsylvania-men-1500069692", "news_title": "Two Charged in Killings of Four Missing Pennsylvania Men", "keywords": "bucks county,cosmo dinardo,crime,dean finocchiaro,jimi patrick,mark sturgis,matthew weintraub,murder,pennsylvania,sean kratz,thomas meo,Cosmo Dinardo,Jimi Patrick,Paul Lang,Sean Kratz,Thomas Meo,political,general news,legal action,manslaughter"}, {"content": "Could we be approaching the end of the Bernie Sanders era in liberal political thought? The pendulum has been swinging so fast and so far in the direction of radical leftism that even mainstream publications have become comfortable dismissing endorsements of western civilization itself as \u201calt-right\u201d nativism. But a new book from a chaired history professor at Duke University could represent the end of the cycle.In \u201cDemocracy in Chains: The Deep History of the Radical Right\u2019s Stealth Plan for America,\u201d Duke\u2019s Nancy MacLean argues that Nobel Prize-winning economist James Buchanan was not simply a pioneer in \u201cpublic choice\u201d theory, which holds that government officials act out of self-interest just like everyone else. In Ms. MacLean\u2019s view, Buchanan was also the author of a plan to subvert democracy and favor rich white people.Your humble correspondent has not read the book. And some readers of this column will say that a university professor flinging outlandish accusations at a critic of big government is not news. But what is news here is that Ms. MacLean\u2019s book is not finding the public reception she might have expected. Yes, certain far-left pundits have praised the work, but the trade publication Inside Higher Ed writes that the \u201cstory keeps unfolding, with MacLean\u2019s critics alleging inaccuracies and other problems with her book,\u201d and \u201cMacLean in turn alleging a coordinated attack against her by libertarian scholars.\u201dMany libertarian scholars have criticized her book. George Mason law professor David Bernstein is among those who have posted critiques on the Washington Post website.But it\u2019s not just libertarians who cite problems with the MacLean rendering of history. At Vox of all places, two academics who describe themselves as \u201con the center left\u201d have written a piece entitled, \u201cEven the intellectual left is drawn to conspiracy theories about the right. Resist them.\u201d The authors write:The Vox contributors conclude: \u201cMacLean is not only wrong in detail but mistaken in the fundamentals of her account.\u201d Could it be that progressives have been moving left so quickly that the young adults at Vox have already become\u2014at least in relative terms\u2014the moderate elder statesmen of the movement? Perhaps the pendulum is starting to swing back. Regardless, it\u2019s refreshing to see that at least one progressive website intends to help serve as a reality check on Duke\u2019s history department.We\u2019ll leave it to readers to decide whether they want to delve into Professor MacLean\u2019s book.

Morgan                   and             Citigroup Inc.       Shares of Wells Fargo & Co., which also reported second-quarter results Friday, slipped 1.1%.Pittsburgh-based PNC said it continues to expect loans to be up by mid-single digits for the full year. Analysts took that as an encouraging sign, especially amid industrywide questions about whether an election-fueled rally in bank stocks will translate into more bank lending. PNC officials said Friday they expect continued steady growth in U.S. gross domestic product.The bank also announced it would expand corporate-lending offices into new regions. In an interview, PNC\u2019s head of corporate banking,       Terry Begley,        said businesses are creating \u201cdecent\u201d growth in loan demand but are concerned by uncertainty around health care, taxes and other Washington debates. \u201cThey can live with different government policies,\u201d Mr. Begley said, referring to corporate customers, \u201cbut they want to know what it is.\u201dLoans at the bank grew 4% from a year ago to $218 billion, fueled mostly by commercial lending, where PNC focuses most of its business. Part of that was due to the bank\u2019s purchase earlier this year of a portfolio of construction, transportation and other loans.Overall, PNC reported earnings of $1.09 billion, or $2.10 per share, up from $966 million, or $1.82 per share, in the year-earlier quarter. Revenue jumped 7% to $4.06 billion. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had forecast earnings of $2.02 per share on revenue of $3.99 billion.PNC is the first major regional bank to report results this quarter. Its results came on the same day as those of bigger banks including J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. Both of those banks were hurt by weaker trading, a volatile business that doesn\u2019t impact most of the regional banks.PNC also benefited from the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision to raise interest rates three times since December, which allows banks to charge more on loans. PNC\u2019s net interest income grew 9% compared with a year ago. Net interest margin, a key measure of lending profitability, was also higher.Instinet analyst Bill Carcache said PNC results \u201cset a high bar\u201d for the regional banks that will report next week. But       Terry McEvoy,        an analyst at Stephens Inc., noted that the better-than-expected earnings were helped by a lower loan-loss provision, \u201cwhich typically [is] not rewarded by investors.\u201dPNC also announced it would open middle-market offices in Denver, Houston and Nashville next year. It recently expanded into Dallas, Kansas City and Minneapolis as well.But another part of Mr. Demchak\u2019s strategy is to focus more on consumers. He acknowledged that the bank had historically underinvested in consumer lending and noted new consumer products, including a cash-reward credit card. \u201cWe have a lot of work to do,\u201d he said, \u201cand it\u2019s going to take a while.\u201dStill, that doesn\u2019t mean raising deposit rates for consumers any time soon. Like most other banks, PNC has been reluctant to pass those higher rates along to deposit customers.Mr. Demchak said he thinks \u201cwe\u2019re still a couple [Fed] moves away\u201d before banks have to notably increase deposit rates for retail customers. And while some online lenders might be offering much higher rates, he said they represent only a tiny percentage of consumer deposits.PNC previously experimented with higher promotional rates on some deposit products, but pulled away from that strategy to focus, it said, on customers who want a long-term relationship with the bank.Write to Christina Rexrode at christina.rexrode@wsj.com and Imani Moise at imani.moise@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-14 17:46:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/pncs-earnings-rise-on-loan-growth-1500031834", "news_title": "PNC\u2019s Earnings Rise on Loan Growth", "keywords": "bank earnings,bank loans,pnc bank earnings,pnc earnings,pnc profit,PNC Financial Services Group,PNC,financial performance,earnings,corporate,industrial news,banking,commercial banking,credit,financial services,regional banks"}, {"content": "Nevada officials were stunned last month to learn that             Anthem Inc.,       the only insurer selling plans statewide through the insurance exchange, was planning to pull back next year, leaving consumers in most counties with no way to get plans under the Affordable Care Act.\u201cIt felt like a gut punch,\u201d says Heather Korbulic, executive director of Nevada\u2019s insurance exchange, where consumers buy ACA coverage online. When she learned of the situation from insurer filings, she says, she blurted out loud: \u201cHoly shit, what are we going to do?\u201d Nevada officials quickly began pushing to solve the problem.As some insurers announce plans to pull back or exit insurance exchanges, and others seek major rate increases for next year, states are trying to hold together fraying individual insurance markets. State officials say they are caught between insurers nervous that they will face losses on their exchange business and uncertainty at the federal level as Republicans\u2019 efforts to pass a major health overhaul drag on.The states\u2019 challenges highlight the pressure on Republicans in Washington to do something to support the exchanges if the overhaul bill fails to pass, potentially working with Democrats on legislation\u2014a possibility Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has raised.\u201cThere is a general feeling that we\u2019re on the front lines,\u201d says       Julie Mix McPeak,        Tennessee\u2019s insurance commissioner. She worked to convince BlueCross BlueShield of Tennessee to offer plans next year in 16 counties that were at risk of lacking exchange coverage after             Humana Inc.       announced it would leave.The Tennessee insurer has requested a 21% rate increase, which it said was almost all tied to worries that federal officials won\u2019t enforce the ACA\u2019s mandate for insurance coverage and will stop making key payments that help reduce low-income enrollees\u2019 health costs.Officials in Missouri and Washington have landed insurers to fill blank spots on their marketplace maps. But other states confront potentially empty counties, with 20 in Ohio, four in Indiana and 14 in Nevada at risk of lacking exchange plans next year, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.Insurers\u2019 pullbacks have sent state officials scrambling to woo, pressure and cajole reluctant companies, with rounds of phone calls and meetings. At least one state, aiming to ensure coverage, has gone further: In New York, officials have said that to participate in Medicaid contracts, insurers must offer exchange plans in the state.In Iowa, which has one insurer currently enlisted to offer exchange plans statewide next year, officials are pushing for federal approval of an emergency proposal to rework many of the ACA\u2019s rules in the state. Alaska recently won a federal waiver for its effort to bolster its exchange, a reinsurance program to blunt insurers\u2019 costs for unhealthy enrollees.Several other states are eyeing similar requests. \u201cWe\u2019re going to make this work,\u201d says Mike Kreidler, Washington state\u2019s insurance commissioner, who said he is working on potential proposals with insurers and the state\u2019s exchange. And he said he is cooperating with insurers to press federal officials for clarity on cost-sharing payments.Randy Pate, a deputy administrator at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said in a statement the agency \u201ccontinues to work with state departments of insurance and issuers to address bare counties, exploring all options available under current law.\u201dAn agency spokeswoman said the ACA \u201cwas failing well before President Trump took office\u201d and the Trump administration \u201cis still considering its options\u201d about the cost-sharing payments, which she said could be resolved if Congress passed a health bill.A recent Kaiser Family Foundation analysis found insurers\u2019 financial results on exchange plans improved in the first quarter of this year, a sign of potentially emerging stability.Number of insurers participating in ACA exchanges in 2017, by countyCounties at risk of having no insurer in 2018OneThree or moreTwo20 counties at risk", "news_time": "2017-07-14 17:46:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/states-to-health-insurers-please-come-back-1500043372", "news_title": "States to Health Insurers: Please Come Back ", "keywords": "aca ,healthcare overhaul,healthcare reform,health insurance exchanges,individual health insurance,obamacare,what will replace obamacare,Anthem,ANTM,plans,strategy,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,society,community,welfare,social services,insurance,non-life insurance,health,medical insurance,financial services,health maintenance organizations,private health insurance"}, {"content": "An investor in             Arconic Inc.        ARNC 0.96%       is accusing the company of deceiving shareholders by failing to disclose the risks connected to manufacturing aluminum panels that investigators suspect contributed to the spread of a deadly fire last month in a London apartment tower.The lawsuit seeking class-action status and brought by       Michael Brave       accused former Chief Executive       Klaus Kleinfeld       and Chief Financial Officer       Kenneth Giacobbe       of misleading shareholders about the financial risks of investing in the company.The complaint said investors \u201csuffered significant losses and damages\u201d related to the June 14 fire at Grenfell Tower, where at least 80 residents died and at least 70 more were injured.Arconic, which primarily produces metal parts used by the aviation and automotive industry, declined to comment on the lawsuit, which was filed Thursday in U.S. District Court in Manhattan.Robert Willoughby,        a spokesman from Pomerantz LLP, the firm representing Mr. Brave, said the lawsuit is the first shareholder action against Arconic following the fire. He declined to provide details about Mr. Brave, including how many shares he owned.The complaint said Arconic failed to tell investors it supplied its highly flammable panels with polyethylene cores for part of the exterior cladding on buildings such as the 24-story London tower.Arconic on June 26 said it had stopped selling the panels for high-rise building applications. Shares of Arconic closed down 6% on June 26, and fell an additional 9% in the following trading day.Mr. Brave is seeking damages for losses sustained by investors who purchased Arconic shares between Feb. 28 and June 26, the complaint said. Feb. 28 is the date Arconic filed its annual report, which Mr. Brave contends was incomplete.Arconic\u2019s market capitalization dropped $3 billion from Feb. 28, when the stock closed at $28.79, to June 27, indicating the potential vulnerability of investors who bought shares in the months leading up to the June 26 announcement. On Friday, they closed 6 cents lower on the day at $24.39.Arconic, formerly part of Alcoa Inc., was already embattled before its role in the June 14 fire came under scrutiny. Arconic was recovering from a bitter proxy fight with an activist investor earlier this year that led to the resignation of Mr. Kleinfeld.       David Hess       is currently serving as the company\u2019s interim CEO.Arconic has said its panels have been certified for use as a construction product in both the U.K. and U.S. and it sells them with the expectation they will be used in compliance with all building codes and regulations.U.K. officials have said that building standards prohibit the material from being used in buildings as high as Grenfell Tower because of fire-safety concerns. U.K. building-industry experts and the company that supplied the material dispute that usage of the products violated building standards.Arconic has said the same panels wrap a prominent Marriott hotel in Baltimore.             Marriott International                   has said it is working with the building\u2019s owner to determine whether that is the case.Write to Bob Tita at robert.tita@wsj.comAppeared in the July 15, 2017, print edition as 'Arconic Is Sued Over Flammable Panels.'", "news_time": "2017-07-14 17:36:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/investor-sues-arconic-over-flammable-panels-1500055402", "news_title": "Investor Sues Arconic Over Flammable Panels", "keywords": " aluminum cladding,aluminum panels, fire, grenfell tower,investor lawsuit,Arconic,ARNC,Robert Willoughby,Klaus Kleinfeld,Kenneth Giacobbe,Michael Brave,corporate crime,legal action,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,disasters,accidents,building fires,explosions,collapses,man-made disasters,primary metals,legal services,basic materials,resources,business,consumer services"}, {"content": "AT&T Inc.

One would contain AT&T\u2019s wireless business and its DirecTV satellite television business, the other would comprise the Time Warner assets it plans to acquire, including HBO, Warner Bros. and the Turner cable unit that houses CNN, the people said. AT&T last year said it would take control of the entertainment company in a cash-and-stock deal worth about $85 billion.The new structure would keep AT&T Chairman and Chief Executive       Randall Stephenson       atop the company with two top lieutenants, in an organization that would resemble             Comcast Corp.        CMCSA 0.41%      Brian Roberts,        Comcast\u2019s chairman and chief executive, has two segment chiefs: one in charge of the cable business and the other heading NBCUniversal.The Justice Department is conducting an antitrust review of the transaction, although President       Donald Trump\u2019s       pick for antitrust chief, White House deputy counsel Makan Delrahim, is awaiting Senate confirmation. The Senate is locked in a broader political showdown over nominations, and it isn\u2019t clear when Mr. Delrahim might be confirmed.Justice Department staffers have interviewed executives and collected information from the companies and rivals in the industry, but the process is in something of a holding pattern until Mr. Delrahim is in place, according to a person familiar with the matter.Mr. Trump vowed to block the deal when he was still a candidate but hasn\u2019t commented on it since taking office. The combination of two distinct businesses\u2014video and the networks that distribute it\u2014is considered unlikely to face an outright government challenge. But authorities have imposed merger conditions on similar tie-ups, including Comcast\u2019s takeover of NBCUniversal.The administration\u2019s ongoing feud with Time Warner subsidiary CNN adds another wrinkle to the process. White House officials have tangled with several national media outlets, but Mr. Trump has saved extra ire for the cable news network.AT&T has said it would maintain CNN\u2019s independence post-merger and has no plans to spin off the network. The company still expects to complete the transaction later this year.AT&T spokesman       Larry Solomon       said the company is still developing its integration plans and hasn\u2019t completed the new organizational chart.Mr. Stankey, a 30-year AT&T veteran, is currently head of AT&T\u2019s entertainment business, which includes DirecTV and has offices near Los Angeles. He has previously served as the company\u2019s strategy chief and held various executive roles in its traditional telecom business.He would sit atop the existing Time Warner business, but AT&T has indicated it would like to retain some top executives at Time Warner to take advantage of their expertise, according to a person familiar with the matter. Time Warner CEO       Jeffrey Bewkes       has said he will stay on for an interim period to help with the transition.Under the new structure, DirecTV would be combined with the company\u2019s telecom operations, which are run out of AT&T\u2019s Dallas headquarters and include both the wireless and landline business, the people familiar with the matter said. That segment would be run by       John Donovan,        another AT&T veteran who is currently chief strategy officer, one of the people said.News of planned executive changes were earlier reported by Bloomberg News.AT&T has hinted it will be more than just a passive owner of Time Warner\u2019s news and entertainment assets. Mr. Stephenson in May floated some ideas for the combination that included shorter, smartphone-friendly HBO videos and specially targeted advertising.How Time Warner, as part of AT&T, might negotiate with the carrier\u2019s competitors is another potential concern. Mr. Stephenson addressed some of those fears in May by repeating his pledge to keep its most popular content available to all distributors.\u201cYou can\u2019t think about taking \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019 and you\u2019re only going to make it available to AT&T customers,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cThat\u2019s crazy.\u201dAT&T has started toying with special entertainment offers ahead of the deal\u2019s close.

It was a big hindrance to us and our growth.\u201dMr. Granger, who works in Lake Charles, La., had managed more than $100 million in client assets at Wells Fargo, where he had worked for nine years.In its second-quarter earnings Friday, Wells Fargo said its total number of brokers had fallen 1%, or 130, to 14,527 as of June 30 from the previous quarter. Wells Fargo\u2019s broker count had been stagnant since 2014 through early last year. Since the third quarter of last year, when the bank announced its sales-practice settlement, its attrition picked up.From the second quarter in 2014 through the second quarter of last year, Wells Fargo\u2019s overall broker force fell slightly less than 1% to 15,042. But since the third quarter of 2016, its total number of brokers has fallen nearly 4%, by 559 brokers. Because the bank reports net totals each quarter, it wasn\u2019t clear how many brokers left Wells Fargo.A Wells Fargo spokeswoman attributed the declining head count to \u201crecent demographic and regulatory shifts [that] have resulted in some retirements across the industry.\u201d She added Wells Fargo has a strong pipeline of experienced recruits and trainees ready to join the firm.Analysts say the head count decline isn\u2019t surprising. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to market to new clients as you have that [issue] as an overhang,\u201d said       Brian Kleinhanzl,        a banking analyst with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Inc. \u201cit\u2019s going to be a challenge for a time period and it\u2019s hard to say how long that will be.\u201dThe industry is dealing with a graying broker population, with researchers saying the average age of a broker these days is in their mid-50s. Besides that, analysts say the Labor Department\u2019s fiduciary rule requiring brokers to act in the best interest of retirement savers has caused some to retire sooner than they would have.Still, Wells Fargo\u2019s brokerage departures have been outpacing those of rivals. Other brokerage-owning banks haven\u2019t reported second-quarter results yet, but both             Bank of America Corp.\u2019s       Merrill Lynch and             Morgan Stanley                   said broker forces declined by half a percentage point from the third quarter of 2016 through the first quarter this year, while UBS Group AG lost slightly more, with its total number of brokers falling 1.7%.While Wells Fargo\u2019s broker count has fallen since the sales scandal, referrals from the bank\u2019s community-banking arm to the wealth unit jumped 12% from the previous quarter. Two of the months during the quarter had $1 billion in monthly referred investment assets; in the first quarter, Wells Fargo said it had only one month where it reached $1 billion in monthly referred investment assets.Wells Fargo\u2019s chief financial officer,       John Shrewsberry,        said those referrals were the result of \u201ceffective partnering between our bankers and financial advisers.\u201dTotal assets within Wells Fargo\u2019s wealth arm reached $1.8 trillion, up 8% from the year-earlier period on higher market valuations and customers entrusting more cash with the bank\u2019s financial advisers.Wells Fargo is trying to turn around its head count fortunes with more aggressive broker recruiting at a time when many rivals have temporarily stopped. Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley and UBS have all said they would curtail their recruitment efforts at least temporarily to save costs and shift spending elsewhere, such as on broker technology. Wells Fargo, meanwhile, sweetened its pitch in May, saying it would offer some brokers a recruitment bonus as much as three times the annual fees and commissions they generate. The bank has also put more emphasis on attracting younger brokers to its ranks.Chief Executive       Timothy Sloan       told analysts on a conference call Friday that the bank has directed significant resources toward repairing its relations with consumers, and undertook a companywide \u201cculture assessment\u201d in recent months.\u201cWe are processing these results and the goal is to identify both positive attributes and potential weaknesses we can take actions that will strengthen our culture, \u201dMr. Sloan said.Write to Michael Wursthorn at Michael.Wursthorn@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-14 17:16:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/wells-fargo-broker-defections-pick-up-since-cross-sales-scandal-1500062737", "news_title": "Wells Fargo Broker Defections Pick Up Since Cross-Sales Scandal", "keywords": " broker recruitment , brokers, wealth management,wells fargo, wells fargo 2q broker level,wells fargo brokerage, wells fargo broker count, wells fargo broker levels, wells fargo financial advisors, wells fargo wealth management,LPL Financial Holdings,LPLA,Wells Fargo,WFC,WFCL,banking,commercial banking,financial investments,security brokering,dealing,credit,financial services,investing,securities,private banking,wealth management"}, {"content": "Gold prices rose Friday, after weaker-than-expected U.S. inflation data eroded the case for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates in coming months.Gold for August delivery closed up 0.8%, at $1,227.50 a troy ounce, on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange.The consumer-price index was unchanged in June from the prior month, the Labor Department said Friday.

The House defense bill\u2019s budget also surpasses a spending request from President       Donald Trump.       The White House has expressed concern over two dozen provisions of the bill, including its cost.The bill passed 344-81 with 117 Democrats backing it.The National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, lays out 2018\u2019s military policy and suggested budget, greenlights increased pay for troops and calls for more ships, aircraft and military members, among other policy priorities.The House will need to reconcile its version of the NDAA with the Senate\u2019s version of the measure and ensure that a separate appropriation measure eventually includes the $696 billion in military spending required under the House measure.Lawmakers also will have to decide whether to repeal or increase the limit on military spending enacted by the Budget Control Act of 2011, which originally was passed with bipartisan support when Washington, D.C., grappled that year with a potential credit default.\u201cI understand there are several steps to go, and we\u2019ll take them step by step,\u201d said House Armed Services Committee Chairman       Mac Thornberry       (R., Texas).The Senate Armed Services Committee passed its own version of the bill in late June that required $640 billion in military spending, also exceeding the 2011 cap, though the Senate version of the NDAA has yet to hit the Senate floor. Senate leaders said they would take up the issue before next month\u2019s summer recess.House Republicans sidestepped amendments to the NDAA that could have made the measure\u2019s passing more problematic, defeating a contested amendment introduced by Rep.

Excluding food and energy, prices rose 0.1%. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected overall prices to advance 0.1% and core prices to gain 0.2% on the month.The lower-than-expected figures were the latest sign of muted inflation, which is a main threat to government bonds because it erodes the purchasing power of their fixed returns and can lead to higher interest rates from the Fed.The 10-year yield settled at 2.319%, compared with 2.348% Thursday and 2.393% a week earlier. It was the yield\u2019s largest weekly decline since the week ended June 2. Yields fall when bond prices rise.Friday\u2019s data came after testimony before Congress this week from Fed Chairwoman       Janet Yellen,        which also sent yields lower. While Ms. Yellen reiterated her expectation that inflation will rise over the coming years, she also said the central bank would be watching inflation data closely and could reassess its strategy if it continues to disappoint.Investors interpreted Ms. Yellen\u2019s comments as \u201cmodestly dovish\u201d and Friday\u2019s data \u201chelps feed into that view,\u201d said John Canavan, market analyst at Stone and McCarthy Research Associates.Adding to the downward pressure on yields Friday was a report from the Commerce Department that retail sales fell 0.2% in June from the prior month. That was below the 0.1% gain expected by economists.Still, bonds quickly pared gains. After initially falling below 2.3%, the 10-year yield climbed back above that level, reflecting strong forces that are still pushing up on yields, analysts said.Before this week, investors had been selling bonds, driven largely by anxiety that an improving global economy may allow major central banks outside of the U.S. to scale back on stimulus efforts that have helped lift asset prices since the financial crisis.A big reason why bond yields climbed Thursday, some analysts and investors said, was a report from The Wall Street Journal that European Central Bank President       Mario Draghi       is scheduled to address the Federal Reserve\u2019s Jackson Hole conference in August.

NDAQ 0.15%       told lawmakers Friday that systemic risk in the $13.9 trillion U.S. Treasury market would be reduced by requiring trades be guaranteed by clearinghouses.Regulators required more extensive use of central clearing for such financial derivatives as interest-rate swaps after the 2008 financial crisis. But the vast majority of secondary-market trading in U.S. Treasurys doesn\u2019t involve a central clearinghouse, as many electronic trading firms that are major players in the market find it too expensive to pay the margin requirements and fees.\u2018The clearing market structure, in our view, has fallen behind the realities of automated trading\u2019Clearinghouses are funded by their members, generally large banks or brokers, and seek to reduce risk by standing in the middle of each trade insuring trades get executed even if one side defaults.Trades are still cleared, sometimes through other banks or brokers, but the situation has left regulators and trading venues such as Nasdaq\u2019s without a comprehensive view of traders\u2019 exposures to other participants, said       John Shay,        Nasdaq\u2019s global head of fixed income, in testimony prepared for a House Financial Services Committee subpanel.\u201cThe clearing market structure, in our view, has fallen behind the realities of automated trading,\u201d Mr. Shay told the committee. \u201cThis development poses material counterparty risk to the market. The market instead relies on the solvency of the trading venues and an ever-diminishing number of clearing brokers.\u201dThe shortage of central clearing also imposes costs on venues that match buyers and sellers of Treasurys, including one operated by Nasdaq, said Jim Greco, a former trader who founded Direct Match, an electronic platform for trading Treasurys. That\u2019s because the venue is exposed to margin calls from the clearinghouse, known as the Fixed Income Clearing Corp., to guarantee trades by high-speed firms that aren\u2019t members of the clearinghouse but have grown to provide much of the liquidity on the venues.The clearinghouse \u201cis designed for large banks with infinite capital at their disposal,\u201d said Mr. Greco, whose startup closed last year because it couldn\u2019t efficiently access clearing. \u201cThere needs to be a recognition of, hey, this market really has changed. It\u2019s no longer just banks here.\u201dNasdaq, which owns a venue once known as eSpeed, also urged that reporting of Treasury trading be made more transparent. Bond traders this week began reporting secondary trades to a database maintained by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the first time that U.S. regulators have required an inventory of trades in the Treasury market.Regulators required reporting of Treasury trades after the bond market showed signs of instability in an October 15, 2014 episode that became known as the Treasury \u201cflash rally,\u201d when prices surged and yields plummeted before they quickly rebounded.That database isn\u2019t public, however, and can only be seen by regulators. In addition, some market participants that aren\u2019t members of Finra don\u2019t have to report their trades to Finra\u2019s warehouse.Regulators lacked a central repository of Treasury trades when the flash rally occurred, leaving them scrambling to find a complete source of data they could analyze to understand the volatility. It eventually took the U.S. government more than eight months to issue a report, which called for better trade reporting and potentially new oversight of firms involved in the automated market.Write to Dave Michaels at dave.michaels@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-14 16:28:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/nasdaq-urges-central-clearing-of-treasury-trading-1500047715", "news_title": "Nasdaq Urges Central Clearing of Treasury Trading", "keywords": "automated trading,bond market,central clearing , clearinghouse,database,finra,government bonds,nasdaq,oversight, regulation,regulators,systemic risk ,treasurys,treasury trading,u.s. treasury market ,Nasdaq,NDAQ,John Shay,regulation,government policy,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,executive branch,treasury department,equity markets,debt,bond markets,money,currency markets,foreign exchange markets,derivative securities,commodity,financial market news,government debt,national government debt,stock exchanges,swaps,financial investments,securities,commodity exchange activities,financial services,investing"}, {"content": "SAYLORSBURG, Pa.\u2014The reclusive cleric who was accused by Turkish President       Recep Tayyip Erdogan       of planning a coup attempt one year ago from his gated U.S. compound urged in a rare interview that the West stand up to what he called Turkey\u2019s increasingly authoritarian leader.In an ornate conference room in his home in the Pocono Mountains, the cleric Fethullah Gulen repeated his declaration that he has never been involved in any coup-plotting. He decried Mr. Erdogan for launching a purge within Turkey, the brunt of which has fallen on his followers.\u201cI never thought that he could go so bad,\u201d said Mr. Gulen, who said that the Turkish president was unleashing mass hysteria inside the country. \u201cSome parts of Turkish society have lost their ability to think.\u201dSince last July, Turkey has arrested or driven from their jobs tens of thousands of people Turkish authorities accuse of supporting Mr. Gulen. The government has closed hospitals and schools affiliated with his social movement, Hizmet, which translates roughly as \u201cservice.\u201dThe Turkish government said it has seized up to $4 billion in property previously owned by businessmen or foundations alleged to be linked to the movement.\u201cNothing like this has been seen before in Turkey,\u201d Mr. Gulen said. \u201cIt can only be compared with Lenin and Stalin or Saddam in Iraq.\u201dTurkey is now investigating 160,000 people, and 50,000 have been arrested, with 48,000 of them released, according to Turkey\u2019s ambassador to the U.S., Serdar Kilic. There are outstanding arrest warrants for about 8,000 people, he said.In a news conference held Friday to commemorate the first anniversary of the coup attempt, Mr. Kilic supported the country\u2019s extended state of emergency, saying Mr. Gulen\u2019s followers have spent decades in the ranks of government and it would take time to remove them.Mr. Kilic continued to blame Mr. Gulen for organizing last July\u2019s failed plot, and pressed Turkey\u2019s demand for extradition.He said he saw \u201cmore willingness\u201d on the part of the Trump administration to entertain the extradition request, but that the process is \u201cnot moving as fast\u201d as Turkey would like.Wyn Hornbuckle, a Justice Department spokesman, declined to comment Friday, saying the Justice Department doesn\u2019t speak publicly about extradition requests.\u201cI believe that there are certain measures that the U.S. authorities can take,\u201d Mr. Kilic said, \u201cincluding limitations on his activities in the United States. He\u2019s still freely giving interviews to newspapers. This is not freedom of expression, he\u2019s accusing the Turkish government, he\u2019s sending messages to his supporters in Turkey and he is still traveling.\u201dMr. Gulen said that his movement is also coming under pressure outside of Turkey as Ankara tries to persuade countries to shut down his movement\u2019s schools in other countries. Many governments have refused, his aides said, but others have been currying favor with Ankara by shutting down schools and transferring property to the Turkish government.Mr. Gulen described what he called rising chauvinism and racism in Turkey\u2014as well as Europe and the U.S.\u2014but said traditional institutions weren\u2019t addressing them head on. \u201cNATO has a potential, the European Parliament has a potential,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in their current state they don\u2019t seem to be addressing these problems right now.\u201dOn July 15, 2016, mutinous elements of the Turkish military took to the streets, tanks opened fire on civilians and jet fighters bombed parliament as part of the unsuccessful coup attempt, during which commandos also made a botched effort to catch or kill the Turkish president. More than 240 people died in the violence.The Turkish government alleges that Mr. Gulen\u2019s followers in his homeland have been plotting for years to take over the state through powerful positions in the military and judiciary and across the civil service. Authorities in Ankara liken him to a cult leader.Mr. Gulen, who has been a resident of the U.S. since 1999, said he supports a modern and moderate version of Islam that supports democracy, science and tolerance.His presence in the U.S. was an early quandary for President Donald Trump, who sought closer relations with Turkey and whose former national security adviser, Mike Flynn, had performed lobbying work on behalf of the Turkish government.Aides to Mr. Gulen said they think any extradition to Turkey is less likely after the resignation of Mr. Flynn, who had failed to disclose the extent of his contacts with foreign officials.In the interview, Mr. Gulen said that the Turkish president\u2019s authoritarian streak was on display during his visit to Washington earlier this year, when Mr. Erdogan\u2019s personal bodyguards attacked protesters outside the Turkish Embassy. Federal prosecutors in the U.S. later filed charges against at least 10 members of the detail.\u201cThey are not like guards, they are like assassins who are so devoted to their leader that they will not refrain from shooting people,\u201d he said.The Turkish Embassy said at the time that the Erdogan supporters were responding in self-defense to terrorist sympathizers.Mr. Gulen\u2014a powerful orator known as the Hocaefendi, or respected teacher, by his followers\u2014has written numerous books and delivered emotional video speeches.His group, formed at a time when Turks feared religious persecution by a secular government, has often been cagey about its membership, contributing to allegations that he in fact was running a secret cult.Graham Fuller, former vice chairman of the U.S. National Intelligence Council who has defended Mr. Gulen\u2019s movement as a positive force for moderate Islam in today\u2019s world, said the allegation is no longer deserved. \u201cOver the last decade or more it has had a very public face,\u201d he said.In Turkey, Gulenists have spread throughout state institutions such as the courts and the military \u201cto ensure these institutions would not be used against them again,\u201d said Mr. Fuller, who in 2006 wrote a letter to the FBI defending Mr. Gulen against attempts to extradite him.\u2014Felicia Schwartz contributed to this article.Write to Alan Cullison at alan.cullison@wsj.comAppeared in the July 15, 2017, print edition as 'Turkish Cleric Assails President.'", "news_time": "2017-07-14 16:24:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/accused-turkish-cleric-assails-president-on-anniversary-of-coup-attempt-1500063885", "news_title": "Accused Turkish Cleric Assails President on Anniversary of Coup Attempt", "keywords": "gulen,gulenist,hizmet,Recep Tayyip Erdogan,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics"}, {"content": "The price isn\u2019t right for retailers.

The government\u2019s ability to use those tools is expected to run out in early-to-mid-October, according to the Congressional Budget Office.The Treasury Department\u2019s cash balance, however, could drop to very low levels in early September, which this spring prompted warnings about potentially raising the debt limit before the August congressional recess.Without an increase, the government would start missing promised payments, such as interest on the national debt, paychecks for federal workers and benefits for recipients of Social Security and other programs. The administration has urged Congress to act quickly.The debt-limit vote is often challenging for lawmakers. Although the vote merely allows the government to pay the bills stemming from past spending and tax decisions, it can appear to voters and political opponents like a vote for more debt.The upcoming debt-limit vote will be the first once since March 2006 with Republicans in control of the House, Senate and White House. Raising the limit will bring little joy for Republicans, many of whom want to tie spending cuts or other fiscal restraints to the debt limit.As a result, the debt limit is likely to be attached to other must-pass legislation or to something like the veterans bill that is politically popular. The White House is supportive of the strategy, one of the people familiar with the discussions said.House Veterans Affairs Committee Chairman       Phil Roe       (R., Tenn.) said Friday he could see the logic of pairing the veterans bill with raising the debt limit, traditionally a tough vote for many Republicans.\u201cYou know how this place works: You always stick something people love onto something people hate,\u201d Mr. Roe said. \u201cObviously something that has to be done\u2014that\u2019s what we always do to get the debt ceiling\u201d raised, he said.Mr. Roe noted that GOP leaders hadn\u2019t discussed with him the idea of pairing the bills.Congress created the Veterans Choice program in response to long wait times for medical care at VA facilities.President       Donald Trump       signed legislation earlier this year that eliminated an Aug. 7 expiration and extended authorization for the program until it runs out of the $10 billion that Congress put in the program in 2014. That account was down to $821 million in mid-June, Veterans Affairs Secretary       David Shulkin       told a Senate committee.Mr. Shulkin said then that the program will \u201cdry up by mid-August\u201d without the ability to transfer money from one VA account to another. That could create pressure on Congress to act before the August recess.Congressional leaders haven\u2019t announced their plans for the debt limit, though Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) has delayed the chamber\u2019s August recess by two weeks, and said the debt limit was on the legislative agenda for that period. They are expected to seek an increase that is large enough to avoid having another vote before the 2018 election.Orrin Hatch       (R., Utah), the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee \u201cis working with the administration to get more details on what the appropriate time will be for Congress to act to raise the debt ceiling and is continuing to work with his colleagues in Congress to find a viable path forward to achieve this goal,\u201d said his spokeswoman,       Julia Lawless.\u2014Kate Davidson contributed to this article.Write to Richard Rubin at richard.rubin@wsj.com, Nick Timiraos at nick.timiraos@wsj.com and Kristina Peterson at kristina.peterson@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-14 16:15:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/gop-may-tie-debt-limit-increase-to-veterans-bill-1500050835", "news_title": "GOP May Tie Debt-Limit Increase to Veterans Bill ", "keywords": "debt,debt ceiling,debt limit,health care,veteran health,veterans,veterans affairs,House Veterans Affairs Committee,Veterans Affairs,government finance,government budget,taxation,government borrowing,economic news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,executive branch,upper house,veterans affairs department"}, {"content": "Oil prices rose for a fifth straight day Friday, as the U.S. dollar weakened and investors focused on signs of an easing supply overhang.U.S. crude futures settled up 46 cents, or 1%, to $46.54 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent, the global benchmark, rose 49 cents, or 1.01%, to $48.91 on ICE Futures Europe.The dollar tumbled on Friday after U.S. data showed that inflation was flat in June from the prior month.

They have been climbing in recent days as investors have been encouraged by recent data showing large weekly declines in U.S. oil stockpiles. Price rose again Thursday after the International Energy Agency said demand is accelerating.The rally hasn\u2019t put oil anywhere near the $60 mark that many had predicted it would be on its way to by now, but it does show that investors may believe the lows the market hit at $42.53 in June were likely the bottom for the time being.Prices also perked up in earlier trading after             Royal Dutch Shell\u2019s       unit in Nigeria declared a force majeure on Bonny light crude exports from Nigeria, following a pipeline shut down.Rising output in Nigeria and Libya, two members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries exempt from the group\u2019s production cut agreement, has been one of the factors keeping oil prices from climbing higher.But some investors remain focused on the global glut of oil.Gene McGillian, research manager at Tradition Energy, said he expects prices to continue pivoting around the $45 mark unless there are additional drops in U.S. storage inventories or further indications that summer driving season is ramping up.\u201cAt these levels, we find out whether people believe the global supply demand balance is tightening,\u201d he said.In its report, the IEA also noted that OPEC members are slipping in their compliance with an agreement to curtail output. OPEC last year teamed up with 10 other big producers outside the cartel\u2014including Russia\u2014to cut production through March by roughly 1.8 million barrels a day from the record levels reached last October.The market is only \u201ca little bit more balanced,\u201d said       Tom Pugh,        a commodities economist at Capital Economics. \u201cWe have gone from extremely bearish to quite bearish,\u201d he added.The IEA\u2019s more robust demand outlook is supported by China\u2019s endless thirst for foreign crude.

The Pentagon provided no additional details on the operation.Other members of the group, known as ISIS-K, were also killed, which will \u201csignificantly disrupt the terror group\u2019s plans to expand its presence in Afghanistan,\u201d Ms. White said in the statement.The death of Sayed is largely symbolic, since ISIS-K replaces its leaders as soon as they are killed. Sayed is the third such leader in a year, after the previous emir,       Abdul Hasib       was killed in April by U.S. forces. The emir who held the position before him was       Hafiz Sayed Khan,        killed by U.S. forces in July 2016.\u201cAfghan and U.S. forces launched a counter-ISIS-K offensive in early March 2017 to drive fighters from Nangarhar and send a clear message to ISIS that there is no sanctuary for their fighters in Afghanistan,\u201d Ms. White said.The U.S. has been officially fighting Islamic State in Afghanistan since January 2016, after the group began to establish a presence, mostly in Nangarhar province in eastern Afghanistan. Then-President       Barack Obama       provided the authority to the Pentagon to begin fighting the group at the time, when there were as many as 3,000 Islamic State fighters there.That authority has helped curb the group\u2019s activities and now officials estimate the group has fewer than 1,000 fighters inside Afghanistan, according to U.S. officials.In April, Gen.       John Nicholson,        the top commander in Afghanistan, gave orders for U.S. forces to drop the largest nonnuclear bomb in the U.S. arsenal, the GBU-43B Massive Ordnance Air Blast bomb, the so-called Mother of All Bombs, killing dozens of ISIS fighters in caves in Afghanistan.The July 11 operation came as the Trump administration is grappling with the way forward in Afghanistan and the Taliban appears to have the upper hand, controlling a majority of the country. About 10,000 U.S. troops are deployed to Afghanistan. Defense Secretary       Jim Mattis       is considering whether to send up to another 4,000 American troops there.The Trump administration provided Mr. Mattis with the authority to decide on his own how many troops to send to Afghanistan, with a ceiling of 3,900, according to U.S. officials.Mr. Mattis is under pressure from lawmakers and inside the Pentagon to first complete a strategy review of the war.

Forever late and missing trains, he acquired such a taste for Prohibition-era gin that it proved to be his undoing. He would shine bright, recording jazz solos that still bring tears to the eyes of devotees\u2014and empurpled superlatives to the pens of critics. And then he would burn out, dead at 28, his brief life and lasting art the stuff of legend. He, of course, was       Bix Beiderbecke,        and his story continues to fascinate.In \u201cFinding Bix: The Life and Afterlife of a Jazz Legend,\u201d       Brendan Wolfe       draws together the sometimes incomplete facts of Beiderbecke\u2019s biography and the often contentious debates about his significance. Beiderbecke (1903\u201331), one of the first great jazz soloists to have his work preserved on record, was a cornet player who dazzled not with displays of technique or excursions into the high range but with subtlety and understatement. The relaxed quality of his solos often stood out against the more tentative and even stilted playing of his fellow musicians. Achieving success first with the Wolverines (a small group in the Midwest), he would move on to the larger orchestra of Jean Goldkette, and then to the still-larger, and wildly popular, orchestra of Paul Whiteman, who was billed as \u201cThe King of Jazz.\u201dBy Brendan WolfeIowa, 235 pages, $24.95Calling the cornetist \u201cpart       Keats       and part Fitzgerald,\u201d Mr. Wolfe grants that Beiderbecke has often been portrayed as though he were \u201ca nineteenth-century Romantic hero refitted for the Jazz Age.\u201d Ardent fans of Beiderbecke\u2019s work\u2014Bixophiles, they are called\u2014have for decades tripped over one another in an effort to praise its quality. Mr. Wolfe, who grew up in the cornetist\u2019s birthplace (Davenport, Iowa), tries to separate man and myth, but it turns out to be a difficult task. The more he looks, the more he finds: Beiderbecke has been celebrated in tall tales and adoring biographies, in a French graphic novel and a British television series. And yet, the more he finds\u2014much of it inconclusive and contradictory\u2014the further his subject recedes from him. By some accounts Beiderbecke was a \u201cgenius\u201d whose fate was nothing short of \u201ctragic\u201d; by others, a \u201cdrunk\u201d whose inability to negotiate everyday life made him \u201cridiculous.\u201d No summary appears reliable or definitive.Debates about Beiderbecke\u2019s significance in jazz history tend to revolve around the matter of race. Fairly and with delicacy, without himself taking sides, Mr. Wolfe sets out the views of opposing critics, some believing that Beiderbecke\u2019s contributions are underrated because he was white, others maintaining that he and other white musicians co-opted a musical tradition that was not theirs, impoverishing it in the process.Mr. Wolfe is adept at introducing details that serve as promissory notes. Sometimes the details are minor, the payoff small yet satisfying. Early in the book he mentions chancing upon an obituary of the illustrator       James Flora       tucked into the pages of a second-hand biography of Beiderbecke. The significance of Flora, \u201ca father of album cover art,\u201d is revealed much later on, when we are shown a 1947 cover that, in Flora\u2019s artistry, brings to life the important musical and personal relationship between Beiderbecke and his Whiteman bandmate, the saxophonist       Frankie Trumbauer.At other times the details Mr. Wolfe introduces are major. The most striking of these deals with an incident that occurred when Beiderbecke was 18, prompting a police investigation. (He was accused of a \u201clewd & lascivious act\u201d with a 5-year-old girl; the charges were later dropped.) An early chapter ends with policemen \u201c[knocking] on the door and politely [asking] for Mr. and Mrs. Beiderbecke.\u201d We will learn about the incident itself (some of whose facts, Mr. Wolfe acknowledges, \u201care a muddle\u201d) only much later in the book. Mr. Wolfe renders this visit from the police so skillfully that it endows the next hundred pages with a heavy sense of foreboding.One of the book\u2019s strongest chapters tells of a 1929 interview with Beiderbecke appearing in the Davenport Democrat. While calling it \u201cthe only known interview of the jazz legend,\u201d Mr. Wolfe adds that \u201cthere\u2019s always been something a little off\u201d about it, something \u201cthat jazz scholars have struggled to clearly articulate.\u201d After some sleuthing, he discovers that the interview was plagiarized from several sources, borrowing words from music journalists       Henry Osgood,       Abbe Niles       and others. Perhaps Beiderbecke was reticent and the interview came to nothing. Then again, perhaps the temptation to plagiarize was too great for the Davenport reporter to resist. Whatever the case may be, the result is that Mr. Wolfe\u2019s understanding of Beiderbecke \u201cgrows smaller and smaller, until eventually he disappears.\u201dAn engaging book, \u201cFinding Bix\u201d is hampered in places by greater authorial self-indulgence than necessary. Mr. Wolfe, an editor by trade, sometimes resorts to words (\u201cicky,\u201d \u201cwuss\u201d) and formulations (\u201csound geeks,\u201d \u201cinfo-laden charts\u201d) that themselves could have been edited out. His habit of interspersing extremely short chapters\u2014the shortest containing 46 words\u2014among long ones feels writer-conscious. When he addresses the reader directly, the effect can be jarring: \u201cYou want and need Bix talking to you, and . . . you want and need to keep up with him.\u201dA more serious problem resides in Mr. Wolfe\u2019s disinclination to discuss Beiderbecke\u2019s music in any appreciable depth. He has long lived with these solos and absorbed them to their last detail, but his familiarity works against him. He perhaps forgets that many readers don\u2019t know what to listen for. How, for example, does Beiderbecke\u2019s style differ from that of       Louis Armstrong      ? While Mr. Wolfe notes their respective contributions to the history of jazz, he avoids going into specifics. How helpful it would have been to be guided, in a nontechnical way, through a comparison of, say, Beiderbecke\u2019s solo on \u201cI\u2019m Coming Virginia,\u201d recorded in 1927, and Louis Armstrong\u2019s \u201cWest End Blues\u201d from a year later. Through such guidance, listeners of today might come to find Bix in the way that matters most: through the medium of his music.Another way of finding Bix Beiderbecke is in recordings that reflect his influence. In 1941, 10 years after Beiderbecke\u2019s death, the Glenn Miller Orchestra recorded \u201cA String of Pearls.\u201d It would become one of the orchestra\u2019s biggest hits. Two-thirds of the way through, there is a short solo, a minor masterpiece, by the cornetist       Bobby Hackett.       From its relaxed tone and charming understatement to its easy pacing and cogent construction, everything about the solo echoes Beiderbecke\u2019s aesthetic sensibility. It became so famous that it was later lushly harmonized for the entire Miller trumpet section. The harmonization is plainly a tribute to the artistry of Bobby Hackett\u2014but it is more than that. Bixophiles hear in it a tribute to an earlier cornetist whose influence can never be forgotten.\u2014Mr. Check is a professor of music at the University of Central Missouri.", "news_time": "2017-07-14 16:08:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/young-man-with-a-horn-1500062889", "news_title": "Young Man With a Horn", "keywords": "bookcar0715,book review,books,political,general news,arts,entertainment,reviews"}, {"content": "Intercontinental Exchange Inc.             will take over supervision of a key measure of silver prices, adding a new prize to the family of benchmarks run by the New York-based exchange operator.ICE and the London Bullion Market Association said Friday that ICE, beginning in the fall, would start running the daily electronic auctions that determine the LBMA Silver Price.         CME Group Inc.       and         Thomson Reuters Corp.       have jointly run the benchmark since 2014.Formerly known as the silver fix, the benchmark is used by miners, precious-metal refiners and commodity traders as a reference price in physical supply contracts. It is similar to the LBMA Gold Price, the former gold fix, which ICE has run since 2015. The two measures also set the price of some derivatives contracts and exchange-traded funds.Until several years ago, both the gold and silver fixes were set in daily conference calls held by a small number of bullion-trading banks. But the decades-old process was dropped in favor of electronic auctions after it came under regulatory scrutiny.In 2014, U.K. regulators fined         Barclays               PLC \u00a326 million (about $34 million at current exchange rates) for failing to prevent one of its traders from manipulating the gold fix. The Wall Street Journal reported in 2015 that U.S. officials were investigating at least 10 major banks over the possible rigging of precious-metals markets. No charges have been brought, and the current state of the investigation is unclear.Benchmarks set by groups of large banks came under scrutiny after a scandal erupted five years ago over the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, a reference rate that is used to set the price for trillions of dollars of derivatives contracts and borrowings world-wide.Deutsche Bank AG      , UBS Group AG and half a dozen other financial institutions have collectively paid billions of dollars over allegations that they manipulated Libor or related interest-rate benchmarks. Deutsche Bank and UBS both entered guilty pleas over their roles.ICE, the owner of the New York Stock Exchange, has emerged as a main beneficiary of the push to clean up critical benchmarks. In 2014, it replaced the British Bankers\u2019 Association as the administrator of Libor, and it took over another troubled interest-rate benchmark, ISDAfix, now called the ICE Swap Rate.The LBMA is an industry group that represents a variety of bullion-market participants, including central banks and gold miners, and which owns the intellectual-property rights to the gold and silver benchmarks. It had been looking for a new administrator for its silver price since CME and Thomson Reuters said earlier this year that they would quit running it, citing new European rules on benchmark regulation set to take effect in January 2018. The rules require regulated benchmarks to have one administrator, calling into question the two companies\u2019 joint operation of the silver price, two people familiar with the situation said.ICE beat out the London Metal Exchange, owned by         Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Ltd.      , which had also been seeking to run the LBMA\u2019s silver benchmark, a person familiar with the situation said.ICE Benchmark Administration, the unit that will handle the silver price, makes money by collecting a slice of the licensing fees paid by companies using its gold and interest-rate benchmarks for their own products and activities.Write to Alexander Osipovich at alexander.osipovich@dowjones.com", "news_time": "2017-07-14 16:07:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/ice-to-supervise-lbma-silver-price-benchmark-1500055173", "news_title": "ICE to Supervise LBMA Silver-Price Benchmark   ", "keywords": "gold fix,lbma,silver fix,CME Group,CME,Intercontinental Exchange,ICE,Thomson Reuters,TRI.T,London Bullion Market Association,money,currency markets,money markets,commodity markets,metals markets,commodity,financial market news,precious metals markets,silver markets,routine market,financial news,financial investments,securities,commodity exchange activities,digital content services,financial services,online service providers,investing,media,entertainment,technology"}, {"content": "In January 1929, a Bolshevik sympathizer and class-war enthusiast sat down in his study in the lovely English countryside to write one of the 20th century\u2019s most joyful, exuberant tales of childhood derring-do. \u201cSwallows and Amazons,\u201d published the following year, had all but rushed from       Arthur Ransome\u2019s       fingers. \u201cHammering away at his desk, occasionally getting up to chortle and rub his hands, the entire adventure came to him with extraordinary ease,\u201d wrote one of his biographers,       Roland Chambers,        in \u201cThe Last Englishman\u201d (2009). Newly reissued, \u201cSwallows and Amazons\u201d (Godine, 351 pages, $14.95) recounts the piratical and nautical escapades of six children in two sailing dinghies on the wide waters of an inland sea in England\u2019s Lake District.At historical remove some nine decades later, what leaps out from the story is the children\u2019s amazing freedom to go where they like and do what interests them. The four eldest Walker children\u2014John, Susan, Titty and Roger\u2014are spending the holidays at a farm with their mother and baby sister, \u201cfat Vicky.\u201d They\u2019re yearning to sail the vessel Swallow to a tantalizing little island in the lake and live there for the summer. To that end, they\u2019ve written to their father, who is at sea on a navy destroyer, to ask permission.The story opens with his reply, a famous message that is impossible to imagine a parent sending today, and not because the slang has changed: \u201cBETTER DROWNED THAN DUFFERS IF NOT DUFFERS WONT DROWN,\u201d reads the telegram. As John, who is perhaps 13, explains: \u201cIt means that daddy thinks we shall none of us get drowned and that if any of us do get drowned it\u2019s a good riddance.\u201d (Can you imagine?)As the children collect provisions and prepare to ship out, their mother warns them only once to be careful, when she cautions them to keep the walls of their tents outside their waterproof ground-sheets \u201cor if it rains you\u2019ll find yourselves sleeping in a puddle.\u201d She has every confidence in the good sense and resourcefulness of her children and arranges with a farm nearer the island to supply them with fresh milk: Every morning, one of the Swallows must row across for it. They cook and boil water for tea over an open fire. Only Roger, at 7 the youngest mariner, is forbidden to use matches. He is, however, free to mess about in boats as much as he likes and bathe in the lake unsupervised, despite not having yet learned to swim.Meanwhile, Nancy and Peggy Blackett, who live nearby and claim the island as their own, announce themselves to the Swallows by firing real arrows at them. They are the Amazons, named for a boat that flies the black flag of piracy. The adversaries conduct a formal parley, like buccaneers, declare mutual war and everyone has a fabulous time. There is much talk of natives and savages and walking planks, and there are many meals of line-caught fish, scrambled eggs and seed cake, not to mention pemmican (corned beef), molasses (toffee) and grog (lemonade).No one gets an eye put out, no one drowns and no one wears sunscreen. We know from historical accounts and from the occasional yarn from an old-timer that within living memory children could be trusted with matches and clasp knives and were known to look after each other without constant adult intervention or correction. Those days are gone. People are arrested for allowing their children to walk shorter distances by themselves than the Walker and Blacketts sail, at night, without life vests. Along with its swashbuckling vision, \u201cSwallows and Amazons\u201d offers a poignant reminder of what\u2019s been lost.A new BBC film version of the novel opens this weekend in the U.S. It both reflects the current moment and takes liberties with the story, as movies tend to do. The filmmakers have shifted events forward six years, to 1935, putting Europe on the cusp of war and creating an opening for adult intrigue involving the Amazons\u2019 foul-tempered, houseboat-dwelling uncle,       James Turner.       In a neat choice, the actor playing Turner (      Rafe Spall      ), known as \u201cCaptain Flint\u201d to the children, resembles Arthur Ransome as a young man. The screenwriters have also made use of the author\u2019s fondness for the Soviet Union in developing the arc of the cinematic uncle\u2019s back story.The movie is less fanciful than the book (with no talk of natives or savages), and there\u2019s more crying, squabbling and shrieking. For all that, the film is lush and beautiful, capturing the grandness of maritime adventure, the pleasure of make-believe and the sincerity of the Swallows and Amazons in their endeavors.It is incredible that such a jolly book and 11 sequels could have been written by an English sailing enthusiast who embraced the ideological goals of       Vladimir Lenin.       Between 1917 and 1924, Arthur Ransome (1884-1967) was the Russia correspondent for two British newspapers. He reported on the Russian Revolution and on the spasms of violence and political terror that succeeded it with stunning approbation. As a votary, he grew close to many leading Soviet figures; he even married       Leon Trotsky\u2019s       private secretary.In an article published in the United States in 1918, Ransome hailed the dictatorship of the proletariat and the extirpation of the bourgeoisie and predicted that \u201conce the conditions of parasitism, privilege and exploitation have been destroyed, the old divisions of the class struggle will automatically have disappeared.\u201d It\u2019s hard to square such cruel, mechanized thinking with the good humor, brisk pitching-in and humane understanding in Ransome\u2019s novels for children. Indeed, \u201cSwallows and Amazons\u201d would seem to celebrate everything that the Bolsheviks despised and sought to destroy, not least tradition, personal independence and individual imagination.Soviet commissars may no longer trouble us, but the busybody enemies of youthful adventure abound. They will not like reading about young seafarers vying for supremacy and fending for themselves unchaperoned. For those who regret the hemming-in of childhood, though, the Swallows and Amazons are free-range children to gladden the heart.", "news_time": "2017-07-14 16:05:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-book-your-kids-should-read-this-summer-1500062718", "news_title": "The Book Your Kids Should Read This Summer", "keywords": "bookcar0715,book review,books,political,general news,arts,entertainment,reviews"}, {"content": "Tatiana de Rosnay tells us that, at the age of 11, when she first opened a copy of \u201cRebecca,\u201d she \u201chad no idea how important that novel would become in my life.\u201d We may believe her, but its author,       Daphne du Maurier,        might have bridled. Just as       Conan Doyle       came to resent Sherlock Holmes because he overshadowed the historical novels that Doyle valued more highly, so it irritated du Maurier to be known principally for \u201cRebecca,\u201d which was made into what is now a classic film by       Alfred Hitchcock.But Ms. de Rosnay is right to highlight that best-selling 1938 novel. It made du Maurier famous. If other du Maurier novels are still read\u2014for instance, \u201cJamaica Inn\u201d and \u201cMy Cousin Rachel,\u201d if not, alas, \u201cThe Progress of Julius,\u201d a remarkably harsh, chilling unromantic early book\u2014it is because of \u201cRebecca.\u201d It may be derivative, a reworking of \u201cJane Eyre\u201d with a sub-Byronic hero and a fascinating and mysteriously dead first wife replacing a mad one in the attic. It may be full of clich\u00e9s. It doesn\u2019t matter. The novel is still compellingly alive.By Tatiana de RosnaySt. Martin\u2019s, 340 pages, $27.99Daphne du Maurier was born in 1907, in London, into the upper reaches of bohemia. Her grandfather George was an artist and the author of the best-selling novel \u201cTrilby\u201d (known best for the character Svengali). Her father, Gerald, with whom she had an intense, perhaps unhealthily intense, relationship, was a star of the London theater. Her cousins, the Llewelyn-Davies boys, inspired       J.M. Barrie       to write \u201cPeter Pan.\u201dThere was something of Peter in Daphne. As a young girl she wanted to be a boy and invented for herself an alter ego called Eric Avon. The boy never quite died in her.She was educated partly in France, her paternal ancestors\u2019 country. There she fell in love with a schoolmistress who encouraged her writing. Later she would have intense emotional friendships with other women, notably the actress       Gertrude Lawrence       and       Ellen Doubleday,        the wife of her American publisher. In the course of writing to Doubleday, Ms. de Rosnay says, du Maurier \u201cadmits what she thinks she is: a strange hybrid, a woman with the soul of a boy.\u201dHer marriage to an army officer\u2014Tommy Browning, who commanded airborne troops at Arnhem in World War II and later became a member of the royal household as Prince Philip\u2019s comptroller and treasurer\u2014was sometimes difficult and stormy, partly because she was a writer first and a wife second, partly because he suffered from nervous exhaustion after the war and was unfaithful to her. But the marriage endured, with affection\u2014and guilt\u2014on both sides.Du Maurier developed a passion for Cornwall, the westernmost county of England, where she had set \u201cRebecca.\u201d There, she wrote, she found \u201cfreedom to write, to walk, to wander, freedom to climb hills, to pull a boat, to be alone.\u201d She took a house, \u201cMenabilly,\u201d on a long lease: her version, perhaps, of Manderley, the grand house of Rebecca and Max de Winter.As she grew older, she wrote fewer novels and worse ones. The Economist\u2019s reviewer of her last one, \u201cRule, Britannia\u201d (1972), reproached her, in Ms. de Rosnay\u2019s summary, \u201cfor having isolated herself to the extent that she no longer has any idea what the modern world is like.\u201d This is common enough, as other aging novelists may ruefully confess. But it wasn\u2019t that her power of imagination had withered. In her later years, she wrote chilling short stories, such as \u201cDon\u2019t Look Now\u201d\u2014set in a disturbingly sinister Venice and filmed memorably by       Nicolas Roeg      \u2014but she was no longer capable of the sustained creative effort demanded by a novel. Du Maurier died in 1989, in Cornwall, at the age of 81.Ms. de Rosnay identifies herself with her subject to such an extent that she will tell us how Daphne felt and what she thought, often perhaps fancifully: \u201cFrom time to time, she gets up from her desk . . . stretches her numb legs, massages her stiffened fingers. Standing up, leaning against the window, she smokes a cigarette and looks out towards the slim blue line of the sea, lost in her thoughts.\u201dWell, perhaps. \u201cManderley Forever\u201d is written in the historic present, often irritating in a novel, more so in a biography, for it is not always clear how much credence is to be given to the author\u2019s imaginative reconstruction of moods and daily life. Perhaps the historic present works less offensively in the original French (translated here into English by       Sam Taylor      ).As it is, Ms. de Rosnay has written a biography that, despite such annoyances, does justice to its heroine. Daphne du Maurier, as we see, was fortunate in her family and its history, fortunate also to have early found a publisher, Victor Gollancz, who spotted her potential and treated her generously. She was self-centered, though no more than most writers, and more generous than most of them too. Her best novels were possessed of a vitality and conviction that give them an enduring appeal. \u201cRebecca\u201d certainly, a couple of others too, have proved to be that rare thing: a best seller that goes on being read long after its author\u2019s death.\u2014Mr. Massie is the author of many novels, most recently, \u201cEnd Games in Bordeaux.\u201dAppeared in the July 15, 2017, print edition as 'To the Storytelling Manner Born.'", "news_time": "2017-07-14 15:36:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/daphne-du-maurier-in-her-prime-1500060961", "news_title": "Daphne du Maurier in Her Prime", "keywords": "bookcar0715,book review,books,political,general news,arts,entertainment,reviews"}, {"content": "\u2018I fall in love carefully,\u201d says Thandi, the narrator of       Zinzi Clemmons\u2019s       \u201cWhat We Lose\u201d (Viking, 213 pages, $22), and the internal contradictions of the line characterize this debut. You can\u2019t, after all, carefully fall in love any more than you can cautiously leap off a bridge. The best you can try to do is maintain an illusion of control while you plummet.Thandi, who grows up outside Philadelphia, is the child of a black American man and a mixed-race South African woman, and perhaps to compensate for the ambiguities of her complicated heritage\u2014\u201cMy views and my skin made me a lonely little island,\u201d she writes\u2014she has developed a disciplined, analytical way of recounting her experiences. The book\u2019s chapters are succinct, often shorter than a page; the sentences are concise and declarative. Non-fictional material like blog posts and news photos intersperse the story, as if this were an academic study rather than a novel. Thandi, a math tutor, illustrates her emotions with graphs and charts, and when she encounters events that cannot be tamed by logic she explains them to herself using the concept of the asymptote, a line that a curve continuously approaches but cannot reach: \u201cThe idea of a geometrical asymptote is therefore an effort of pure reason, and the possibility of it must be made manifest to the mind, not to the senses.\u201dYet the senses have a way of making themselves known. The turning point in Thandi\u2019s life is her mother\u2019s death from breast cancer, which scrambles any semblance of coherence that she had made of the world: \u201cIt is a sunny day that feels completely gray, and laughter in the midst of sadness. It is utter confusion. It makes no sense.\u201d Nearly as destabilizing is her love affair with a man named Peter, who lives on the other side of the country. When Thandi finds herself pregnant and unsure of how to proceed, the novel\u2019s intellectual poise has been fatally undermined.This makes for anguished but rewarding reading. It\u2019s bracing to find irruptions of passion shoot through the varnished prose like hairline cracks in porcelain. (\u201cSex,\u201d Thandi proclaims, \u201cis kicking death in the ass while singing.\u201d) \u201cWhat We Lose\u201d finds itself when it accepts free fall, morphing from an arid work of assertion into a richly volatile study of grief, wonderment and love.Sally Rooney\u2019s debut, \u201cConversations With Friends\u201d (Hogarth, 309 pages, $26), shares these shape-shifting qualities. The novel centers on two Dublin university students, distant and intellectual Frances and charismatic, \u201cradiantly attractive\u201d Bobbi. The pair were briefly an item\u2014Bobbi is gay, Frances, our narrator, is an \u201comnivore\u201d\u2014but now are best friends who perform as a slam poetry duo. Their act brings them to the attention of a famous essayist named Melissa, and the novel chronicles what happens when the young women enter her rarefied circle, which includes her husband, Nick, a hunky B-list actor.As its leaden title portends, this novel partakes in the inexplicably chic trend epitomized by       Karl Ove Knausgaard\u2019s       \u201cMy Struggle\u201d and       Elif Batuman\u2019s       \u201cThe Idiot\u201d of merely recording everything its characters do or say, like a video feed, with no effort to discriminate between the trivial and the significant. Readers, therefore, have to push through reams of banal small talk and hackneyed dinner-party imagery. (Ms. Rooney is now the millionth writer to poetically describe the glowing tip of a cigarette.)Then things change. At first we assume Frances will play the rational Elinor Dashwood role while Bobbi has an ill-advised fling with Melissa. Yet it turns out to be Frances who\u2019s the home wrecker, falling into a surprise affair with Nick. Suddenly the book takes on the excitement of a romance novel or       Hugh Grant       film about ordinary folk who have relationships with gorgeous celebrities. The writing picks up purpose and intensity. The sex scenes are, well, sexy, which is rarer than you\u2019d think. Ms. Rooney\u2019s trick is to render them largely in dialogue, avoiding awkward anatomy lessons. A breathless page-turner emerges.As the affair goes south, and Frances\u2019s acquired habits of secrecy chip away at her friendship with Bobbi, the book transforms again, taking on a darker, spikier complexion. Nick has a history of depression, we learn, and Frances is diagnosed with a painful chronic disorder. The clandestine thrill of their romance comes to look like destructive co-dependency. \u201cI was like an empty cup, which Nick had emptied out,\u201d Frances thinks after an acrimonious fight, \u201cand now I had to look at what had spilled out of me: all my delusional beliefs about my own value and my pretensions to being a kind of person I wasn\u2019t. While I was full of these things I couldn\u2019t see them. Now that I was nothing, only an empty glass, I could see everything about myself.\u201dThat rings true, and so does Frances\u2019s recovery, in which Bobbi plays a crucial part. A lot of affectation encrusts \u201cConversations With Friends\u201d and the ironic repartee gets old quickly. But even the filler can\u2019t disguise that Ms. Rooney is a natural-born storyteller.In       Rachel Khong\u2019s       first novel, \u201cGoodbye, Vitamin\u201d (Holt, 196 pages, $26), Ruth, a 30-year-old sonographer who was recently dumped by her fianc\u00e9, moves back home to Southern California to help care for her father, a university professor in the early stages of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. It\u2019s material for another grueling exploration of loss, and yet, against all odds, Ms. Khong has produced a book that\u2019s whimsical and funny.This is because the author, like her guiding spirit,       Lorrie Moore,        has a love for the ridiculous in the mundane. In the diary entries that make up the novel, Ruth notes these quotidian curiosities. A man at a party suffers a \u201cniacin flush\u201d after eating too many Wheat Thins. A friend\u2019s baby\u2019s admirable first word is \u201cBlah!\u201d When Ruth reads that \u201ccruciferous vegetables\u201d help with memory loss, she commences stuffing her father with cauliflower and bok choy. \u201cNo more crucified vegetables,\u201d he begs. \u201cBut they died for you, Dad.\u201dAmid the fear and heartache there\u2019s plenty of absurdity, too, in her father\u2019s erratic behavior, though Ms. Khong never descends to mockery. In the main storyline, the professor\u2019s former students invent a fake class for him to teach, to boost his morale. But the charade doesn\u2019t last long. Mostly this sweet-natured novel is about Ruth\u2019s attempts to come to terms with a past her father can no longer remember while still attending to the quirky, fleeting joys of the present. \u201cHere I am, in lieu of you,\u201d she writes, \u201ccollecting the moments.\u201d", "news_time": "2017-07-14 15:31:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/sam-sacks-on-the-best-new-fiction-1500060695", "news_title": "Sam Sacks on the Best New Fiction", "keywords": "bookcar0715,book review,books,political,general news,arts,entertainment,reviews"}, {"content": "Roger Federer       has won and done just about everything in his magical career.Now, after knocking off Tomas Berdych to make his 11th Wimbledon final at 35 years old, he may have rewritten the manual for approaching a pro tennis career from the wrong side of 30.For the second time this year, Federer, who wore down Berdych in a mathematically-tight-but not-actually-very-close 7-6, 7-6, 6-4 win, will play for a grand slam title after doing something none of his top competitors here did ahead of the feature event on the tennis calendar\u2014he took a break from competitive tennis. And don\u2019t think his contemporaries haven\u2019t noticed, especially since Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray hobbled out of the All England Club after enduring the grueling, continent-hopping schedule that tennis demands.\u201cTaking a break is something I will have to consider,\u201d said an exhausted and banged-up Djokovic on Wednesday, after retiring from his quarterfinal match with arm injuries that have been nagging him for 18 months. \u201cProfessional tennis is getting very physical in the last couple years. It\u2019s not easy to play on the highest level throughout an entire season, then be able to do that over and over again every season.\u201dFederer first figured that out last year, when he skipped Roland Garros rather than fight through an aching knee during the inevitably rigorous matches on clay. He had previously played 65 consecutive grand-slam events.After the match on Friday, Federer made it clear he plans to make rest a priority for the remainder of his career. \u201cAs I move forward I will be very cautious of how much I will play,\u201d he said.For tennis, which has struggled to find a replacement for the aging Federer-Djokovic-Nadal-Murray headline act, the new playbook may present some discomfort in the near term. Andy Murray, who is battling a hip problem, said his goal was to still play all the majors but that he would have to meet with his team to decide how much rest and rehabilitation he needed.Federer took the last six months off in 2016 to rehabilitate an injured knee that doctors said required three months of rest, skipping a scramble for the end-of-season Tour Finals. That worked\u2014he won the Australian Open in January. Then rather than force his body through the rigors of clay\u2014his worst surface\u2014he bailed on the dirt season to rest up for Wimbledon.Federer has spent the past two weeks floating across the Centre Court grass and toying with twentysomethings, by all accounts as carefree as he has ever been at a major championship. Tim Henman, the former British pro who occasionally appears on the BBC, said 90 minutes before the Berdych match he saw Federer goofing off in the locker room, playing mini-basketball and watching mindless videos. Martina Navratilova, who made a women\u2019s singles final here when she was 37, has been marveling at the fitness Federer\u2019s rest has produced, as though he had discovered the fountain of youth.\u201cSometimes the body and the mind do need a rest,\u201d Federer said earlier this week. \u201cYou just want to take that decision early enough and anticipate.\u201dFederer is hardly the first aging legend to gain from a prolonged timeout. Swimmer Michael Phelps was mostly off between the last two Olympics. He first attempted retirement, then served a suspension for drunk driving. He returned to the 2016 Games fresh as ever to win five more gold medals. A pretty good basketball player named Michael Jordan spent 18 months playing baseball in his early 30s, then returned to win three more championships.Tennis is uniquely positioned to allow the aging greats to pick their spots, even in the grand slams, rather than punish themselves through its nearly 11-month season. All of the top players have surfaces they love and ones they would be happy to never play on again.\u201cOnce you hit 30 you\u2019ve got to look back and think, \u2018How much tennis have I played? How much rest did I give my body over the years or how much training have I done? Did I do enough? Did I overdo it or not enough?\u2019 It\u2019s always calibrating the whole thing,\u201d Federer said.Federer\u2019s calibrating looks to be as good as his game as he goes for his 19th grand slam. He has not dropped a set here this year. Friday he strutted around Centre Court as though it was his vacation home. He stepped in on Berdych\u2019s power serves and blasted returns. He smacked winners on half-volleys from the baseline, and he picked up aces (13 in all) with lasers down the middle and slice serves out wide. The whole business got taken care of in a crisp two hours, 18 minutes, with Federer bouncing on his toes through the final set.\u201cYou look at the other guys who are 35, 36 on the Tour, clearly you can see the age,\u201d Berdych said. \u201cHe\u2019s doing things the right way.\u201dFederer still stinks at challenging line calls. Rest, after all, can\u2019t do much for aging eyes, and he has always hated the Hawk-Eye system. That appears to be his only weakness as he prepares for Sunday\u2019s final, when he face Croatia\u2019s Marin Cilic. Cilic beat the stubborn American Sam Querrey 6-7, 6-4,7-6, 7-5. Querrey, with his big serve and forehand, gave Cilic plenty of trouble but ultimately didn\u2019t have enough in his arsenal in his first grand slam semifinal.Before Sunday\u2019s final happens, Federer has a day to do something he has gotten very good at\u2014rest.Write to Matthew Futterman at matthew.futterman@wsj.comAppeared in the July 15, 2017, print edition as 'Federer\u2019s New Model for Tennis.'", "news_time": "2017-07-14 15:31:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/federer-makes-it-look-easy-using-new-playbook-1500060713", "news_title": "Federer Makes It Look Easy, Using New Playbook", "keywords": "Roger Federer,sports,tennis,routine general news"}, {"content": "According to Michael Connelly\u2019s powerful procedural \u201cThe Late Show\u201d (Little, Brown, 405 pages, $28), the title phrase is slang for the Los Angeles Police Department\u2019s night shift: a twilight zone of \u201cvampire crimes\u201d and a graveyard for cop careers.

Her consequent demotion to night patrol has not diminished Ballard\u2019s devotion to her job, though, and especially not to \u201cthe sacred bond that existed between homicide victims and the detectives who speak for them.\u201d Ballard and her male partner deal with several murdered citizens, and the victim of a near-fatal beating, during an especially eventful 11-to-7 shift. Despite repeated warnings not to become involved, Ballard covertly works the cases during and in between her official duty stints. The murder victim whom Ballard shepherds through the system is a waitress shot by chance, it seems, during a mass killing in a club where she worked; Ballard traces the discouraging outline of the dead woman\u2019s life. Of equal concern is a transgender person, an apparent prostitute, beaten and tortured: \u201cone of the worst cases she had seen where the victim was still alive.\u201d An irate Ballard is especially eager to find the perpetrator: \u201cThis is big evil out there,\u201d she tells her partner.Mr. Connelly documents his protagonist\u2019s investigations painstakingly.

Smith, a Republican political activist and financier from Chicago who mounted an effort to obtain former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails from Russian hackers, died on May 14 after asphyxiating himself in a hotel room in Rochester, Minn., according to local authorities. He was 81 years old.Mr. Smith\u2019s body was found by a hotel clerk in the Aspen Suites hotel, located across the street from the Mayo Clinic, according to a Rochester Police Department report. An associate of Mr. Smith said that he had recently visited the clinic. A representative for the facility wouldn\u2019t confirm if Mr. Smith was a patient.Capital Journal is WSJ.com\u2019s home for politics, policy and national security news.Mr. Smith died about 10 days after an interview with The Wall Street Journal in which he recounted his attempts to acquire what he believed were thousands of emails stolen from Mrs. Clinton\u2019s private email server. He implied that Lt. Gen.       Michael Flynn,        then serving as the senior national security adviser to presidential candidate       Donald Trump,        was aware of his efforts.Mr. Smith\u2019s attempts to obtain what he believed would be politically damaging emails marked the first potential evidence of coordination between members of the Trump campaign and Russian hackers, a central issue in probes by Congress and the Federal Bureau of Investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election.When the Journal reported on Mr. Smith\u2019s efforts last month, it wasn\u2019t clear how he died. His obituary listed no cause of death, officials in the town where he lived didn\u2019t release information, and messages left at Mr. Smith\u2019s home went unanswered.The police report said Mr. Smith was found by a hotel clerk with a plastic bag around his head attached tightly with black rubber bands. Mr. Smith \u201cleft documentation on why he committed suicide, medical records, his written obituary, and life insurance\u201d on a table in his room, the report said.The hotel clerk who found Mr. Smith told police the security latch on his door was locked from the inside. Hotel staff said they had to break the door open to enter his room.The note Mr. Smith left said \u201cthere was no foul play, no one assisted him, he had a recent bad turn of health and that his life insurance policy would soon expire,\u201d the police report said.The hotel clerk who found Mr. Smith told police two helium tanks were attached to the bag on Mr. Smith\u2019s head with tubes.By the time he died, Mr. Smith had been in the hotel for 10 days. He was due to check out May 13, but asked the hotel to extend his stay for one day. He was found dead the afternoon of May 14 by the clerk, who was checking Mr. Smith\u2019s room after he didn\u2019t check out by the assigned time.In Mr. Smith\u2019s room, police found a receipt from a nearby             Wal-Mart,       dated May 13, that included \u201chelium jumbo\u201d and pliers.The Chicago Tribune first reported Mr. Smith\u2019s cause of death Thursday.In emails and documents meant to recruit others to his efforts to find Mrs. Clinton\u2019s deleted emails, Mr. Smith and an associate identified Mr. Flynn\u2019s company, Flynn Intel Group, and Michael G. Flynn, the general\u2019s son, as allies in the operation.Neither Mr. Flynn nor his son responded to requests for comment around the time of the original article, which was published June 29.A lawyer for Mr. Flynn and a lawyer for his son, Michael G. Flynn, declined to comment for this article.The group Mr. Smith assembled included technical experts, lawyers and a private investigator in Europe who spoke Russian, he said. The group made contacts with five groups of hackers, including two that were Russian, who claimed to have obtained Mrs. Clinton\u2019s emails, Mr. Smith said.

Morgan Chase        JPM 0.14%       & Co. chief       James Dimon,        took some of the shine off otherwise solid financial results Friday from three of the biggest U.S. banks.J.P. Morgan Chase led the way with record profit in the second quarter of $7.03 billion. Even so, executives cut their guidance for lending growth in 2017 as well as for interest income.Shares in the bank and other lenders fell in response, reflecting investor worries that economic growth might not be strong enough to fuel further gains in bank shares given their postelection run-up. The KBW             Nasdaq                   Bank index is up about 28% since last November\u2019s election, nearly double the performance of the S&P 500 during that time.On Friday, shares of J.P. Morgan dropped about 1%, while shares in the other two big banks that reported,             Wells Fargo        WFC 0.26%       & Co. and             Citigroup Inc.,        C -0.28%fell about 1.2% and 0.7%, respectively.Investor excitement over policy changes that could benefit banks has also cooled amid uncertainty around issues such as a tax-code overhaul or infrastructure spending. Frustration on that front was voiced by Mr. Dimon, who challenged Washington to do more to boost the economy.In doing so, he struck a tone more downbeat than the hopeful one many bankers adopted after President Trump\u2019s election. \u201cIt\u2019s just unfortunate, but it\u2019s hurting us, it\u2019s hurting the body politic, it\u2019s hurting the average American,\u201d Mr. Dimon said of Washington inaction. \u201cWe have become one of the most bureaucratic, confusing, litigious societies on the planet. It\u2019s almost an embarrassment to be an American citizen traveling around the world and listening to the stupid shit we have to deal with in this country.\u201cWe have to get our act together,\u201d he added.Mr. Dimon\u2019s remarks came shortly after the bank said it expected to grow its net interest income by $4 billion this year, down from an earlier projection of $4.5 billion. A big driver of the reduction has been persistent low yields on longer-term bonds, which reflects skepticism about long-term prospects for economic growth and inflation.Long-term yields are moribund despite four increases in short-term rates by the Federal Reserve since late 2015. That combination weighs on bank profits because it narrows the difference between short- and long-term rates\u2014a so-called flattening of the yield curve.Despite such factors, second-quarter results from J.P. Morgan, Wells Fargo, Citigroup and             PNC Financial Services Group Inc.beat Wall Street expectations.Write to Emily Glazer at emily.glazer@wsj.com and Peter Rudegeair at Peter.Rudegeair@wsj.comAppeared in the July 15, 2017, print edition as 'Banks\u2019 Results Raise Red Flags.'", "news_time": "2017-07-14 15:16:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/earnings-take-shine-off-bank-stocks-1500059818", "news_title": "Earnings Take Shine Off Bank Stocks ", "keywords": " 2q earnings,bank earnings, citigroup earnings, interest rates, jamie dimon, jp morgan earnings, lending, loan growth, second-quarter earnings, tradng, wells fargo earnings,J.P.

But new government data showed consumers pulled back spending at mid-year even as markets rallied. Households also grew less optimistic about the future and inflation on consumer purchases softened.Taken together, the indicators pointed to an economy that is entering the ninth year of expansion steady and still creating jobs at a healthy clip, but without obvious additional momentum. President       Donald Trump       has set out an agenda to push economic growth well beyond the roughly 2% pace that has prevailed since the recession ended in 2009, but so far there is little sign of a real breakout happening.Rising stocks could point to an upturn down the road, or conversely a risk that investors could soon get tripped up.Modest price pressures are a possible sign of slower underlying economic momentum and a headache for the Federal Reserve, which has struggled to reach its 2% annual inflation goal since the 2007-09 recession.\u201cTo be sure, the data do not suggest an impending recession,\u201d said Richard Curtin, chief economist for the University of Michigan\u2019s consumer-sentiment survey. \u201cRather, the data indicate that hopes for a prolonged period of 3% GDP growth sparked by Trump\u2019s victory have largely vanished, aside from a temporary snapback expected in the second quarter.\u201dThe president has suggested a number of policies to spur growth, including a tax overhaul and major infrastructure spending, but those aren\u2019t yet close to reality.On the positive side, factory output picked up in June, and domestic energy production is rebounding. Overall economic activity appeared to accelerate in the second quarter following a weak start to 2017, when gross domestic product expanded at a 1.4% annual rate during the first quarter.For the recently ended second quarter, forecasting firm Macroeconomic Advisers projected 2.3% growth and the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta\u2019s high-profile GDPNow model predicted a 2.4% growth pace.Reports\u00a0on Friday\u00a0offered fresh insights into the state of the economy, a broadly healthy picture with some downbeat signals headed into the second half of 2017.Retail and food services salesConsumer sentimentConsumer-price inflationIndex, Q1 1966=100Change from a year earlierChange from a year earlier", "news_time": "2017-07-14 15:08:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/optimism-in-financial-markets-fails-to-show-in-real-economy-1500059325", "news_title": "Optimism in Financial Markets Fails to Show in Real Economy", "keywords": " consumer prices, cpi, donald trump,economy, inflation, jobs, markets, retail sales,economic performance,indicators,economic growth,consumer credit,expenditure,savings,economic news"}, {"content": "A softer than expected decline in trading revenue helped             Citigroup Inc.        C -0.28%       defy Wall Street expectations and grow quarterly revenue by 2% from a year ago.After a late-June uptick in trading activity around global interest rates, revenue was $17.901 billion, defying forecasts of a decline from the $17.548 billion posted a year ago. Analysts had anticipated a drop to $17.4 billion.Still, quarterly profit at the New York-based bank was $3.872 billion, down 3% from $3.998 billion a year earlier, thanks in part to the overall trading decline during the quarter and higher costs associated with credit cards.Shares fell about 0.8% Friday as part of a broader bank-stock selloff driven by fears of slower loan growth and a less favorable interest rate outlook.Citigroup\u2019s per-share earnings rose to $1.28 from $1.24 a year ago as the bank continued to buy back shares at a fast pace. Analysts, on average, had expected $1.21 a share.Like its rival             J.P. Morgan Chase                   & Co., which also reported earnings Friday, Citigroup\u2019s trading desk this quarter suffered from continuing low volatility and a lack of new catalysts in the form of unexpected central-bank rate moves or a pickup in economic activity.However, the drop-off wasn\u2019t nearly as sharp as anticipated, or as sharp as J.P. Morgan\u2019s. Citigroup\u2019s second-quarter trading revenue fell 7% to $3.906 billion from $4.208 billion a year ago. Last month, Chief Financial Officer       John Gerspach       predicted trading revenue would be down by 12% to 13% from a year ago.\\Late June saw a jump in trading in G-10 countries\u2019 interest rates after the Federal Reserve\u2019s increase, and after discussions of possible additional stimulus by the U.K. and European central banks, Citigroup said.Fixed-income trading was off by 6% from a year ago, while equities trading fell by 11%. The decline halted momentum in Citigroup\u2019s relatively undersized stock-trading business, in which the bank has been investing heavily to bring it more in-line with rivals.Citigroup, meanwhile, reported a surge in investment-banking revenue as it stole share from rivals in the business of advising companies on mergers and underwriting stock and bond offerings. The unit was up 22% from a year ago to $1.486 billion, the biggest quarterly haul in seven years.The quarter\u2019s trading result is a blip on what is otherwise shaping up into a turnaround year for the New York-based bank. Chief Executive       Michael Corbat,        who is seeking to convince investors that the bank is poised for sustained growth after years of treading water, has delivered on one major promise already\u2014substantially increase capital returns.The bank received permission from the Federal Reserve, following its successful passage of the stress tests, to pay back $19 billion to shareholders over the next year. That was more than analysts were anticipating and a big boost from last year.The bank said Friday that it paid out 63% of its second-quarter income in the form of dividends and share buybacks. That is set to jump to about 130% of income over the next year.This quarter\u2019s results, however, are only a table setter for the bank\u2019s investor day meeting later this month. The meeting will be the bank\u2019s first such gathering in nearly a decade, when it is expected to lay out a series of growth goals for its consumer and investment-banking businesses.Despite the better-than-expected trading result, investors are still closely watching to see whether banks benefit over the longer term from higher interest rates.J.P. Morgan Chase on Friday warned that gains from lending may be lighter than expected this year, in part because such long-term rates as the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield remain historically low.Citigroup didn\u2019t change its forecast, saying it still expects about $2 billion more interest revenue over the course of the year in its core business. Lending across the bank grew 2% from a year ago.Citigroup also benefited from higher short-term interest rates, which are passed on to credit-card borrowers. The bank relies more heavily on card loans than rivals, and it has been expanding its lending with new partnerships, such as with             Costco Wholesale Corp.       Revenue at the consumer unit rose 5% to $8.035 billion from $7.674 billion a year ago.\u201cWe\u2019re not looking at interest rates suddenly increasing across the board,\u201d said CFO John Gerspach. \u201cOur outlook is not rate-dependent.\u201dThe bank did report a small decline in net interest margin, or the difference between the rates it pays to borrow money and what it earns lending it out.Profit in consumer banking fell, as Citigroup continues to increase its credit costs to account for growth in its card portfolio. Net income from global consumer banking fell 12% to $1.125 billion from $1.284 billion a year ago. The bank has said its card investments may turn profitable in the second half of this year.It also raised its forecast for credit losses on cards it manages on behalf of retailers such as             Macy\u2019s Inc.       and             Sears Holding Corp.       The bank said net credit losses may reach 4.6% this year, up from a prior outlook of 4.35%, blaming tougher-than-expected collections of delinquent debts.Quarterly expenses rose 1% to $10.506 billion.In midafternoon trading, Citigroup\u2019s shares slid 0.8% to $66.47, smaller than declines at             Wells Fargo                   & Co. and J.P.

As a result, many commuters have added the subway, the PATH rail system, buses and ferries to their daily commute.New York Gov.

However, he cautioned that he was aware that track and signal problems could strike at any moment.In recent weeks, Mr. Cuomo expressed skepticism that Amtrak was capable of carrying out the repairs on schedule. Asked whether Mr. Cuomo\u2019s opinion had changed in light of the first week\u2019s progress, a spokesman for the governor said: \u201cI would defer to the governor\u2019s previous comments.\u201dWrite to Paul Berger at Paul.Berger@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-14 15:06:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/penn-station-repair-work-ahead-of-schedule-after-first-week-1500059180", "news_title": "Penn Station Repair Work Ahead of Schedule After First Week ", "keywords": "commuters,derailment,long island rail road,metro north,nj transit,penn station,reparis,summer of hell,track work"}, {"content": "The perennial question about company stock in 401(k) and other retirement plans is timely again.On June 15 and 16, shares in             Kroger Co.      , the Cincinnati-based supermarket holding company, fell more than 26%, largely on the news that             Amazon.com Inc.       would expand in the grocery business by acquiring             Whole Foods Market Inc.       With Kroger\u2019s biggest retirement plans holding just under 28% of their assets in the company\u2019s shares, employees lost about 7% of that collective nest egg in two days. It still hasn\u2019t recovered.The loss might not be permanent, of course. \u201cKroger has competed and won against an ever-changing competitive landscape for 134 years,\u201d says spokeswoman       Kristal Howard.Such sharp, shocking losses are a reminder that investing where you work is riskier than it feels.Buying your company\u2019s stock feels safe partly because of what psychologists call the illusion of control: the unrealistic belief that we can make the future conform to our wishes.The idea isn\u2019t new. An employee buying stock where he works \u201cis in a position to know about the business and to watch his investment,\u201d economists       Robert Foerster       and       Else Dietel       wrote in their book \u201cEmployee Stock Ownership in the United States,\u201d published in 1926.The Pittsburgh Coal Co., National Biscuit Co. and Firestone Tire and Rubber Co. began offering stock through profit-sharing plans around the beginning of the 20th century.             Procter & Gamble Co.       launched its plan in the 1880s.In those days, companies often paid cash \u201cbonuses\u201d on shares that employees held for at least one year. Others sold stakes to employees at an alluring discount from the market price.Today, corporations with traditional pension plans can fund them partly with company stock, avoiding the need to contribute cash, although those shares can\u2019t exceed 10% of pension assets. In retirement accounts organized as employee-stock ownership plans, contributions of company stock are partly tax-deductible to the employer.The company stock held by employees in 401(k) and other defined-contribution plans is typically contributed from the boss\u2019s capital. That makes it feel like found money.And everyone has heard stories of workers at             Berkshire Hathaway Inc.       or Google or             Microsoft Corp.       becoming millionaires as their few initial shares burgeoned into a fortune over time.Still, company stock bristles with a uniquely ruinous kind of risk: It\u2019s most likely to plunge in price when your job itself is in jeopardy. Just think of the employees at Enron Corp. and Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. who suddenly found their retirement plans wiped out and themselves on the street at the same time.Letting go isn\u2019t easy.Efren Beltran,        a logistics manager at Procter & Gamble, retired last September, a few months before he turned 62. By the time he was 50, recalls Mr. Beltran, P&G shares\u2014through stock options, the 401(k), the profit-sharing plan and stock he had bought in his personal account with after-tax money\u2014were at least half his net worth, including his house.He began selling company stock shortly after he turned 50 and became eligible to do so in the profit-sharing plan.\u201cP&G is a wonderful company,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I could not personally handle the risk of being that concentrated in one stock. I love P&G, but I love to sleep well even more.\u201dWorking with financial planners at Truepoint Wealth Counsel in Cincinnati, Mr. Beltran sold the last of his P&G shares this February. \u201cI\u2019ve had some emotions, divesting from the company I love, but it\u2019s the right thing to do,\u201d he says.As of June 2016, P&G employees have allocated 87.8% of their net assets in the company\u2019s $11.6 billion profit-sharing plan to its common stock and a class of preferred stock that carries special tax advantages for employees. That\u2019s more than twice the allocation required by the company.Spokeswoman       Jennifer Corso       says P&G \u201ccan\u2019t offer investment advice\u201d but does \u201coffer additional diversification opportunity\u201d in its retirement plans.Remarkably, according to the Plan Sponsor Council of America, fewer than one-third of employer-sponsored retirement plans that offer company stock limit how much employees can invest in it.Many workers probably don\u2019t want them to. In surveys of investors, behavioral economist       Shlomo Benartzi       found that only 16% to 33% felt their own company\u2019s shares were riskier than the stock market as a whole.The belief that your job automatically makes you a corporate insider, with special insight on the future and perhaps even the ability to shape that future, is hard to shake.But more than half of all companies, over the course of their lifetimes as publicly traded stocks, haven\u2019t even outperformed cash.So putting most or all of your money in only one company, no matter how well you think you understand it, is risky. And putting most or all of your money in the company where you work borders on reckless.Write to Jason Zweig at intelligentinvestor@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-14 15:06:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-much-of-your-companys-stock-is-too-much-1500059199", "news_title": "How Much of Your Company\u2019s Stock Is Too Much?

With no training and little education, she worked as a lady\u2019s companion, a chauffeur, and a skipper on a yacht; but she was not much good at any of these jobs. She remembered, though, how a shrewd uncle, when she left Assam, had suggested she start an agency bringing together bored and lonely spinsters trapped at home with the equally lonely bachelor planters, soldiers and civil servants serving in distant outposts of the Empire. As partner, Audrey drew in       Heather Jenner,        a statuesque divorc\u00e9e who was, like herself, in her mid-20s. With almost no money, and in the teeth of considerable disapproval, the two set up shop as the Marriage Bureau, charging a small sum for initial introductions and a larger one in the event of a successful pairing.The timing was good. Young women were beginning to rebel against waiting powerlessly in the hopes of attracting a husband. Before long, there were queues up the stairs. Young ladies languishing in the home counties made the visit, and men on leave from the colonies. But so did milliners and shop assistants, shorthand typists and musicians, aristocratic widows and divorced actresses, along with rat catchers, clerks, clergymen and baronets. There was a blip after war was declared, but soon came growing numbers of soldiers, wishing to find love before leaving, and women not wanting to be left on the shelf.By Penrose HalsonWilliam Morrow, 339 pages, $15.99Heather and Audrey took meticulous details from their clients and matched them to partners who seemed most suitable, in terms of class, background and interests. The two found themselves becoming counsellors to men and women with little experience of intimacy, easing them away from unrealistic expectations and providing shoulders to cry on. An engaging appendix to this book lists the requests that came their way. Women looked for men with dark or wavy hair, tender hearts and accepting natures but objected to false teeth, bigotry, pub crawling or too great a passion for golf. Men seemed to want \u201caverage, plumpish\u201d women who liked poultry farming. One man had no objection to \u201cpainted finger nails or a dowry\u201d; another requested a \u201cgood cook, able to make jam, dress poultry and rabbits.\u201d Many declared that they would not tolerate bossiness, sarcasm or sulkiness.Not everyone, of course, was matched. There is a painful story of a particularly vulnerable young man, astutely matched to an equally self-doubting woman. They fell in love and went to give his parents the happy news. But his snobbish parents took against the working class girl, who was a shop assistant to boot. The young man hanged himself.Jaunty in tone, with a cozy style reminiscent of women\u2019s magazines of the 1950s, \u201cThe Marriage Bureau\u201d is also a work of social commentary, reflecting a society traumatized by war and desperate to counter the grayness of postwar austerity. Heather and Audrey heard many tales of loneliness, betrayal and insecurity, and they did their best to mitigate them. Eventually the client list of the bureau was handed on to the author of this book, herself a one-time visitor to one of many other bureaus set up as imitators. Over the years, Heather and Audrey secured thousands of marriages. But whether the male client requesting \u201cno hysteria, no gold diggers\u201d and a taste for mountaineering, or the woman asking for a member of the \u201cMetropolitan police force\u201d interested in literature, philosophy and psychology, ever found a mate is not recorded.\u2014Ms. Moorehead is the author of the forthcoming \u201cA Bold and Dangerous Family: The Remarkable Story of an Italian Mother, Her Two Sons, and Their Fight Against Fascism.\u201d", "news_time": "2017-07-14 15:03:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/finding-love-in-london-1500058986", "news_title": "Finding Love in London", "keywords": "bookcar0715,book review,recommended books,books,political,general news,society,community,arts,entertainment,reviews"}, {"content": "By       Miranda Carter       (2001)1. An early memory I have of my grandfather is his reaction to the news that Anthony Blunt, his friend, had been a Soviet agent. I was too young to know who or what a \u201cBlunt\u201d might be, but I knew that my grandfather retreated to his study, where he could be heard whispering to himself occasionally, like a mantra, the final answer to every question running through his mind: \u201cA traitor is a traitor, is a traitor, is a traitor . . .\u201d Blunt was a talented art historian, inspiring teacher and prolific Soviet agent. Employed by MI5 during the war, he passed on thousands of classified documents to Moscow. Indeed, he stole so much that his Soviet masters suspected him (wrongly) of being a British plant. Miranda Carter\u2019s excellent account of his life transcends the genre of spy biography. She navigates Blunt\u2019s life with the authority and wit of an insider, which is testament to her skill as an author as much as to her ability to track down the people that mattered to Blunt and persuade them to talk. Crucially, she unravels the great mystery in Blunt\u2019s life: why he chose to betray his country in the first place.By W.       Somerset Maugham       (1928)2. \u2018Ashenden\u2019 was a sensation when published. Somerset Maugham had worked for MI6 during World War I and never before had a former British intelligence officer produced a roman \u00e0 clef about his undercover work. This signaled a new intimacy between the world of real spies and the fictional literature that had grown up around it. For all this, \u201cAshenden\u201d is underwhelming. In some ways, that\u2019s the point. There is the disappointment of the reader hoping to find out how MI6 really worked and the frustration that Maugham experienced himself in the field. \u201cThe work of an agent in the Intelligence Department is on the whole extremely monotonous,\u201d he complained. There are intricately drawn and memorable characters, like the Hairless Mexican, who is off to carry out an assassination, and Sir Herbert Witherspoon, a British diplomat trapped in a desiccated marriage, but the action is all off-stage. \u201cFact is a poor story-teller,\u201d explains Maugham. \u201cIt has no sense of climax and whittles away its dramatic effects in irrelevance.\u201d Yet \u201cAshenden\u201d represented a new kind of spy novel carried by a different type of hero, one whose defining quality is his detachment. \u201cYou don\u2019t seem to have any feeling one way or the other,\u201d one character tells Ashenden. Of course he does, really, but he keeps this to himself, fastidiously so, as would the heroes of countless spy novels that followed.By       Ben Macintyre       (2007)3. Of all the writerly skills at Ben Macintyre\u2019s disposal, and there are many, one that stands out is his ability to spot a great subject. \u201cAgent Zigzag\u201d tells the story of       Eddie Chapman,        an English criminal who, while in German custody in the early 1940s, volunteered to be a Nazi spy, was parachuted into Britain, and then volunteered to be a British spy. The mystery at the heart of this book is, of course, about where Chapman\u2019s loyalties lie. That question becomes interesting only because Mr. Macintyre makes us care about our hero. Chapman may have been a grinning scoundrel who was at his happiest, writes Mr. Macintyre, \u201cspinning a yarn, looking you straight in the eye, and picking your pocket,\u201d yet in Mr. Macintyre\u2019s hands he becomes deeply sympathetic. By the end, we come to understand his tangle of loyalties toward his various spymasters and lovers and how his capacity for betrayal was matched only by his desire to be loyal.By       Charles Cumming       (2008)4. Set initially in Hong Kong in 1997, just as it was transferred to the Chinese, and later in Shanghai, this is perhaps my favorite Charles Cumming novel. At the heart of it is a terrorist cell of Uighur separatists encouraged by the U.S. in the hope of undermining the Chinese government. The plotting is superb. So too is Mr. Cumming\u2019s evocation of place. But what truly distinguishes this book is the endlessly intriguing relationship between our man in Hong Kong, MI6\u2019s       Joe Lennox,        and Miles Coolidge, of the CIA, the id to Lennox\u2019s ego, a man loyal only to his own desires. Where Joe is restrained, Miles lacks inhibition and is \u201ccontemptuous of the moral censure of others.\u201d The ending of the book is hugely satisfying. Even if you soon lose sight of who betrayed whom, and why, it is hard to shake the memory of Miles Coolidge, one of the great villains of modern spy fiction.By John le Carr\u00e9 (1986)5. This book is less about spies than about fathers and sons, specifically John le Carr\u00e9 (born       David Cornwell      ) and his con-man father, who appears here as Rick Pym. Rick is the bridge that his son, Magnus, must cross. At the start of the book, Magnus is holed up in a boarding house as he writes the story of his own life. There follows a mesmerizing portrait of the vortex surrounding Rick, his courtiers and his \u201clovelies\u201d as they tear around the country promising to see everyone right, which they never can do. The most intriguing character is Rick\u2019s MI6 spymaster, Jack Brotherhood, a \u201chandsome English warlord who served sherry on Boxing Day.\u201d Mr. le Carr\u00e9\u2019s inspiration for Brotherhood was       Maxwell Knight      \u2014his boss at MI5. In Mr. le Carr\u00e9\u2019s hands, Knight comes to stand for an older version of Englishness, one in which intellectual ability is often trumped by loyalty and character.", "news_time": "2017-07-14 15:02:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/henry-hemming-1500058926", "news_title": "Henry Hemming", "keywords": "book review,recommended books,books,national,public security,arts,entertainment,reviews"}, {"content": "As highly social animals, human beings need to be able to recognize the individuals in their community. So evolution has engineered into the human brain an intricate face-recognition system. The system is a network of 12 groups of neurons known as face cells, some 200 of which suffice to identify any given face instantly and to generate a memory that can then be maintained for decades. But that\u2019s not the recognition system\u2019s only trick. We also make instantaneous value judgments about the faces\u2019 owners. This first impression takes about 35 thousandths of a second, and it is involuntary, being integrated with the seeing process rather than the product of conscious thought.\u201cFace Value: The Irresistible Influence of First Impressions,\u201d by Princeton psychologist       Alexander Todorov,        raises a compelling and unresolved issue: First impressions are reasonably consistent, meaning that people largely agree on which faces they judge trustworthy or threatening or dominant. Yet these judgments may be far from accurate, leading to great social injustice in myriad daily interactions where the undeserving make a good impression and the more meritorious leave a bad one.The value of first impressions is a contested subject in psychology. During the 19th century, scholars generally accepted the folk wisdom that the face was a window to the soul and provided a reading of the owner\u2019s character. Modern psychologists later repudiated this view, but recent studies have resurrected the notion that some character traits can be read from the face.Mr. Todorov believes that such studies greatly overstate the accuracy of such judgments. Some basic attributes of a person, he acknowledges, can reliably be assessed from faces\u2014such as the owners\u2019 sex, age and ethnicity and whether they are fat or thin. But we habitually try to infer much more than this, namely important character traits such as whether an individual is trustworthy, aggressive or competent.By Alexander TodorovPrinceton, 327 pages, $32.95These first impressions have far-reaching consequences in daily life. Politicians who appear to be more competent get more votes. Capable-looking CEOs are awarded higher salaries. Cadets with a dominant appearance achieve higher military rank. Untrustworthy-looking defendants receive stiffer sentences.So should all first impressions of character be rejected, or do they hold some probability of truth despite their frequent inaccuracy? Mr. Todorov seems inclined to throw out both baby and bathwater.First impressions, he says, are \u201ccompelling yet inaccurate.\u201d True, everyone learns at a young age that first impressions can be misleading and should be held in check until further evidence is at hand. But if they have no validity at all, then why have we evolved so that the mind makes them almost simultaneously with perceiving a face?Surely in earlier eras, when one\u2019s life could depend on judging a stranger\u2019s intentions immediately, a snap judgment that was merely correct more often than not would have been a lot better than nothing. Hence the facial-evaluation system must have some validity, one might suppose. If it didn\u2019t, natural selection would long ago have eliminated its owners from the gene pool.In \u201cThinking, Fast and Slow\u201d (2011),       Daniel Kahneman       related his work with       Amos Tversky       in delineating the mind\u2019s two appraisal systems, one a purveyor of snap judgments about the world and the other more leisurely and analytical. First impressions are evidently generated by the snap-judgment system. Commenting on Mr. Todorov\u2019s research, Mr. Kahneman wrote that \u201cthe accuracy of face reading is far from perfect. . . . Still, even an imperfect ability to assess strangers confers a survival advantage.\u201d This seems a plausible claim.But Mr. Todorov is unimpressed with evolutionary arguments and keeps them at arm\u2019s length. He concedes that facial impressions can be a good guide to the person\u2019s immediate state of mind but denies them any further validity. \u201cWith the help of context, most of the time we can tell how another person is feeling at that particular moment,\u201d he writes. \u201cBut this momentarily accurate inference is a poor guide to what the person is like in general.\u201dMr. Todorov is understandably concerned that people who look untrustworthy should not be unfairly treated by society on the basis of their looks alone. But the reader may fear that this political goal, worthy though it may be, has interfered with the scientific goal of understanding the world as it is. First impressions can be singled out in the laboratory, and Mr. Todorov\u2019s book excels in explaining how he and other researchers have figured out many of the subtle cues that the mind uses in constructing them. But the reader is left eager for an explanation of how first impressions manage sometimes to be so truthful. \u200b\u2014Mr. Wade is the author of \u201cA Troublesome Inheritance: Genes, Race and Human History.\u201d", "news_time": "2017-07-14 14:59:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-dangers-of-first-impressions-1500058775", "news_title": "The Dangers of First Impressions", "keywords": "bookcar0715,book review,books,political,general news,arts,entertainment,reviews"}, {"content": "Twenty years ago       Stephen Asma       opened for the legendary B.B. King and went on tour with       Buddy Guy,        playing weeks of gigs for hundreds of fans every night. His music career was on the brink of taking off. There was only one problem: It was getting in the way of his day job. For a newly hired professor of philosophy, the lack of sleep and constant travel made teaching classes rather difficult. Mr. Asma had to choose: blues guitar or the love of wisdom. In the end, he picked philosophy, but his \u201cThe Evolution of Imagination\u201d makes a compelling case that we should not, and ultimately cannot, leave our creative roots behind.In the course of this slim but ambitious book on the nature of the imagination, Mr. Asma tells his reader that \u201csometimes an artist like       James Brown       will interrupt a long vamp or groove by calling out to the band. \u2018Should we take it to the bridge, fellas?\u2019 \u201d For Mr. Asma the answer has always been \u201cyes.\u201d The bridge is the point at which a melody takes what he calls \u201ca musical left turn,\u201d a moment that initiates artistic improvisation. This is where things get really interesting and, for a philosopher, even more perplexing.By Stephen T. AsmaChicago, 327 pages, $30Musicians experience the mystery of the bridge. Philosophers try to explain it and, in many cases, make the mistake of explaining it away. Mr. Asma takes readers to the bridge, the site of human creativity, gives them a sense of its thrill, and while doing so leads them through a series of questions that have stymied philosophers for millennia: How exactly does human creativity take place? What is the importance and meaning of the imagination? How did humans first become, in Mr. Asma\u2019s words, the \u201cimprovising ape\u201d?The burgeoning literature on creativity and inspiration, Mr. Asma argues, has done little to provide meaningful answers. Most books fall into one of three categories: \u201cpaeans to famous entrepreneurs and successful CEO creatives\u201d; \u201chow-to books that give artists a series of exercises to unblock their creative flow\u201d; and, finally, ironically boring books about the imagination, what Mr. Asma calls \u201cthe impenetrable academic baffler, chock-full of erudite and cryptic references.\u201d Fortunately, Mr. Asma\u2019s book is not one of these. Instead it is something akin to       Jonah Lehrer\u2019s       \u201cImagine: How Creativity Works\u201d (but without its well-publicized problems)\u2014a lively demonstration and accessible explanation of the origins of human improvisation.First the demonstration. Each of the six chapters in Mr. Asma\u2019s book opens with a brief but moving vignette of his time onstage, primarily descriptions of what it\u2019s like to play       Jimmy Van Heusen\u2019s       famous jazz melody \u201cImagination.\u201d Mr. Asma breaks it down and lays it out but somehow doesn\u2019t destroy the experience: \u201cWith the drummer and bassist pulsing the steady rhythmic foundation, the tenor saxophone player tells the main story over the top.\u201d The story builds and breaks into improvisation: \u201cThe horn player signals the readying musicians to jump in again. But this time the guitarist peals a blistering line that seems to run the head melody backward. His eyes squint tighter as he struggles to complete some mysterious phrase that no one can predict.\u201dI am not a music aficionado (not even close), but Mr. Asma\u2019s firsthand accounts inspired me to listen carefully\u2014first to Van Heusen\u2019s \u201cImagination\u201d and then on to       Bo Diddley       and Otis Rush\u2014to music that I will continue to enjoy long after this review is published. In this respect, the effect of \u201cThe Evolution of Imagination\u201d is not unlike that of       Aaron Copland\u2019s       \u201cMusic and Imagination\u201d (1952). Mr. Asma wants a reader to attend to the imagination, not as it is explained but as it is experienced.Once Mr. Asma has the reader\u2019s attention, the philosophical investigation begins, and it\u2019s not always easy going. The imagination, he admits, is notoriously elusive. It\u2019s often invoked as a vague, catchall concept when human abilities outstrip the attempt to explain them. How did       Michelangelo       \u201csee\u201d an angel in a block of stone and proceed to set it free with his chisel? How did       Nikola Tesla       foresee wireless communication in 1893? How did the Fourth Earl of Sandwich invent Britain\u2019s most remarkable culinary masterpiece? The imagination, of course\u2014whatever that means.One of the problems in understanding human creativity, according to Mr. Asma, is that it is frequently regarded as the endpoint or pinnacle of human evolution, embodied by the rare       Mozart       or Newton living in the past 500 years. On this account, the imagination is a novel and relatively new development in the history of the species. Mr. Asma, by contrast, explains that he is \u201creversing the traditional order of things both logically and chronologically. Improvising did not emerge recently as some rarefied elite employment of otherwise pedestrian symbols and behaviors. It was, instead, the driving force in our natural history.\u201dFollowing anthropologist       Steven Mithen,        Mr. Asma holds that \u201ccognitive fluidity,\u201d the capacity to react and adapt to novel and challenging situations in real time, is a ubiquitous feature of human behavior. When one learns a new language, makes a new recipe, parents a newborn for the first time (all by the seat of one\u2019s pants), one employs the same cognitive frameworks that enable Buddy Guy and B.B. King. In the first chapter, Mr. Asma assures us that \u201cyou, dear reader . . . may not be a jazz musician . . . but you are an expert improviser in some domain\u2014conversation, cooking, parallel parking . . . or small business management.\u201dFurthermore, despite what many have argued, improvisation is not originally symbolic or linguistic but rooted in physical manipulation. Mr. Asma contends that \u201cimprovisation skills emerged from earlier mammalian habits that manage resource exploitation and social cohesion, and they were emotionally (affectively) driven.\u201d Creativity is not the function of some hidden muse or invisible captain operating behind the scenes of cognition but rather of the \u201ccreative body\u201d of our primate ancestors.Invoking the research of neuroscientist       Antonio Damasio,        Mr. Asma notes that the \u201cneocortex [what most people think of as \u2018the brain\u2019] mushroomed to its current size less than 1 million years ago\u201d but that \u201cthe human family broke off from the great apes in Africa 7 million years ago.\u201d What this means is that the symbol manipulation and tool wielding that is regarded as singularly human was grafted on the much deeper (and older) limbic system, which controls memory and emotional processes. How do musicians know how to cross \u201cthe bridge\u201d of a particular song? They don\u2019t think about it. They feel it\u2014at the base of their skull, in their throat, chest, groin and toes.The core of \u201cThe Evolution of Imagination\u201d is dedicated to explaining how this creative body can account for our powers of visual improvisation, drawing and language. When it comes to drawing and painting, Mr. Asma is principally concerned with process rather than finished product. He\u2019s interested in explaining how, in artist       Paul Klee\u2019s       words, one \u201ctak[es] a line out for a walk.\u201d Mr. Asma (who also drew illustrations for the book) maintains that the skills involved in two-dimensional line drawing are continuous with sculpting and, in turn, with object manipulation like the millennia-old art of knapping flint to make basic tools.He takes a similar approach in explaining the evolution of language, extending       Charles Darwin\u2019s       basic intuition that \u201clanguage owes its origin to the imitation and modification, aided by signs and gestures, of various natural sounds, the voices of other animals, and man\u2019s own instinctive cries.\u201d At times, Mr. Asma\u2019s argument for the bodily basis of language is brief\u2014maybe even hasty\u2014but a reader concerned with the details will be satisfied by the copious endnotes. In the end, Mr. Asma\u2019s gestures point in the right direction: \u201cEven when mature language does give us a rich symbol system for easy manipulation, those abstract symbols have their semantic roots [their basic meanings] in bodily activity.\u201d It is easy enough to grasp and to see (two bodily metaphors for understanding) what he means.In my very limited exposure to jazz, I have learned one thing: You should listen all the way through. You never know what will happen. Mr. Asma\u2019s penultimate chapter takes an unexpected turn and addresses what jazz musicians call \u201c \u2018blowing\u2019\u2014derived originally from horn puffing, but now used for all instrument soloing.\u201d When a tenor player steps up on the bridge and loses herself or, in Mr. Asma\u2019s words, \u201ctakes flight,\u201d what exactly is happening? Employing contemporary neuroscience, Daoism and Buddhism, Mr. Asma draws a reader into these creative flow states, those that seem to \u201cblow the self away.\u201dIn 1932, the American philosopher       John Dewey,        one of Mr. Asma\u2019s philosophical heroes, delivered a series of lectures at Harvard that would later be published as \u201cArt as Experience.\u201d The lectures are not perfectly fitted, but together they harmonize, making the case that readers in the 20th century should refocus on the artistic and experimental dimensions of human experience. Mr. Asma attempts to bring this argument up to date. The imagination is what makes each of us uniquely human but also what allows us to live cooperatively with others in a wider natural world that is \u201crelentlessly coming at you in high speed.\u201d We neglect the imagination at our own peril.Mr. Asma closes with a Deweyan insight that, in today\u2019s cultural climate, might be expressed as a warning: The imagination can flourish only under certain conditions, in particular social, political and educational contexts. \u201cStubbornness, inflexibility, and dogmatism in a person try our patience, but in a large-scale population, the dangers are dramatic and pronounced. Populations that hold tightly to ideologies have great difficulty adapting to change.\u201d Mr. Asma counsels letting go\u2014so that we can continue to take it to the bridge.\u2014Mr. Kaag is a professor of philosophy at the University of Massachusetts, Lowell, and the author of \u201cAmerican Philosophy: A Love Story.\u201d", "news_time": "2017-07-14 14:58:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-improvisation-happens-1500058717", "news_title": "How Improvisation Happens", "keywords": "bookcar0715,book review,recommended books,books,political,general news,arts,entertainment,reviews"}, {"content": "Sometimes it is hard to grasp how quickly the giant tech companies have come to dominate the world economy. Ten years ago, only one of them,             Microsoft,       was among the biggest companies in the world as measured by market capitalization. These days, the top five usually consists of             Apple,       Alphabet (the parent company of Google),             Amazon,       Microsoft and             Facebook.It has been an astonishingly rapid rise for the tech giants, and it\u2019s far from over. The big question for the future is: How will their ever-expanding control affect other businesses and the labor market?Over the past decade, Google, Facebook and Amazon have wreaked havoc on much of the creative economy\u2014journalists, musicians, authors, filmmakers. In the decade ahead, the tech behemoths will use their dominance in artificial intelligence to overturn much of the service economy as well, including transportation, medicine and retail. With what result? To give just one example,             Goldman Sachs                   recently reported that self-driving cars (a technology that both Google and Apple are developing) could eliminate as many as 300,000 jobs a year in two decades or more.Will we be ready when the flood of unemployment brought about by the artificial-intelligence revolution is upon us? Politicians are dodging the issue, and Treasury Secretary       Steven Mnuchin       recently assured Mike Allen of the news website Axios that any big change wouldn\u2019t arrive for up to a century: \u201cI think that is so far in the future\u2014in terms of artificial intelligence taking over American jobs\u2014I think we\u2019re, like, so far away from that, that [it is] not even on my radar screen.\u201d At the Code Conference in California earlier this summer, the venture capitalist       Marc Andreessen       also rejected this \u201cfallacy.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a recurring panic,\u201d he said. \u201cThis happens every 25 or 50 years. People get all amped up about \u2018machines are going to take all the jobs,\u2019 and it never happens.\u201dLeaving aside which side of this argument is correct, the fact is that we are rushing ahead into the AI universe with almost no political or policy debate about its implications. Digital technology has become critical to the personal and economic well-being of everyone on the planet, but decisions about how it is designed, operated and developed have never been voted on by anyone. Those decisions are largely made by executives and engineers at Google, Facebook, Amazon and other leading tech companies, and imposed on the rest of us with very little regulatory scrutiny. It is time for that to change.Who will win the AI race? The companies that are already in the forefront: Google, Facebook and Amazon. As AI venture capitalist       Kai-Fu Lee      recently wrote in the             New York Times,       \u201cA.I. is an industry in which strength begets strength: The more data you have, the better your product; the better your product, the more data you can collect; the more data you can collect, the more talent you can attract; the more talent you can attract, the better your product.\u201dTech\u2019s big three are already pushing into other sectors of the economy. Amazon made headlines last month by announcing its plan to acquire Whole Foods. Alphabet\u2019s Verily (formerly Google Life Sciences) is producing a range of medical devices, from glucose-monitoring contact lenses for diabetics to robotic surgery systems. Alphabet\u2019s autonomous-car division, Waymo (which originally started at Google), is already working with             Avis                   to manage their forthcoming self-driving car fleet. As for Facebook\u2019s brand-extension plans, it plans to launch original programming such as TV shows later this year.How did we get here? I would date the rise of the digital monopolies to August 2004, when Google raised $1.9 billion in its initial public offering. By the end of that year, Google\u2019s share of the search-engine market was just 35%;             Yahoo\u2019s       was 32%, and MSN\u2019s was 16%. Today, under Alphabet, Google\u2019s market share is 87% in the U.S. and 91% in Europe. In 2004, Amazon had net sales revenue of $6.9 billion. In 2016, its net sales revenue was nearly $136 billion, and it now controls 65% of all online new book sales, whether print or digital. In mobile social networks, Facebook and its subsidiaries (Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger) control 75% of the American market.This shift has brought about a massive reallocation of revenue, with economic value moving from the creators of content to the owners of monopoly platforms. Since 2000, revenues for recorded music in the U.S. have fallen from almost $20 billion a year to less than $8 billion, according to the Recording Industry Association of America. U.S. newspaper ad revenue fell from $65.8 billion in 2000 to $23.6 billion in 2013 (the last year for which data are available). Though book publishing revenues have remained flat, this is mostly because increased children\u2019s book sales have made up for the declining return on adult titles.From 2003 to 2016, Google\u2019s revenue grew from about $1.5 billion to some $90 billion as Alphabet. Today, it is the largest media company in the world, collecting $79.4 billion in ad revenue in 2016, according to Zenith. Facebook is a distant second, with $26.9 billion.\u2018The massive growth in revenue for the digital monopolies has resulted in the massive loss of revenue for the creators of content.\u2019The precipitous decline in revenue for content creators has nothing to do with changing consumer preferences for their content. People are not reading less news, listening to less music, reading fewer books or watching fewer movies and TV shows. The massive growth in revenue for the digital monopolies has resulted in the massive loss of revenue for the creators of content. The two are inextricably linked.In the third quarter of 2016, companies owned by Facebook or Google took 90% of all new digital ad revenue. As the Journal recently reported, \u201cnone of the would-be challengers to the Google-Facebook \u2018duopoly\u2019 even cracks a 3% share of global digital advertising\u201d (with a few exceptions in China).This extraordinary duopoly is responsible in large part for the declining fortunes of journalism and other content creators, and such businesses are finally starting to fight back. In early July, the News Media Alliance, a group representing U.S. and Canadian newspaper publishers (including Dow Jones, publisher of The Wall Street Journal), called on Congress to allow them to negotiate collectively, as an industry, with Google and Facebook on issues of revenue, customer data and news distribution.Advertisers are critical not just of the duopoly itself but of the whole measurement system used by Google and Facebook to get paid. AdNews recently reported that the \u201cviewability scores\u201d for Facebook video ads are as low as 2% when compared with the standard used for TV ads. In other words, scrolling past an ad for as little as two seconds counts as a \u201cview\u201d for which Facebook charges, while for TV the whole 30-second ad must be viewed.Given the superficiality of these exposures\u2014was the sound even on as the user was scrolling through her newsfeed?\u2014it\u2019s a wonder that any agency pays for these ads. But global brands can\u2019t afford to say no to the dominant platforms. They pay a premium for the privilege, even as Facebook and Google resist efforts to have third parties measure their ad systems, which is standard for TV and newspaper advertising.\u2018Facebook likely knows a lot more about the forces behind the fake-news epidemic than it has publicly disclosed.\u2019This lack of transparency can also be seen in the proliferation of \u201cfake news\u201d\u2014the deliberate spread, often with clear political aims, of online disinformation. Facebook likely knows a lot more about the forces behind the fake-news epidemic than it has publicly disclosed. As the Oxford University researchers       Phillip Howard       and       Robert Gorwa      recently wrote in the Washington Post, Facebook \u201chas the metadata to identify precisely which [fake-news] accounts were created, where they operated and what kinds of things those users were up to during the U.S. election. Their data scientists could probably provide some insights that the intelligence services cannot.\u201dAs for Google, its AdSense software, which provided much of the revenue to the Eastern European users who were flooding the web with fake news during the 2016 election, knows both the IP addresses and, in many cases, the bank-account information of the fake-news providers.Privacy is another issue that the revolution ahead will raise as never before. The conventional wisdom is that Americans no longer care about privacy. As       Kevin Kelly,        the founding editor of Wired, wrote in 2014, \u201cIf today\u2019s social media has taught us anything about ourselves as a species, it is that the human impulse to share trumps the human impulse for privacy.\u201dBut will we be ready to accept the new ways that big tech will monitor our lives? Bioethicists worry that the same accelerometer in your smartphone that records the number of stairs you climb can also record the unique tremors of Parkinson\u2019s disease. What is to stop that information from being harvested by health-insurance companies or employers? Indeed, at what point do they progress from offering you an insurance discount if you wear a health-monitor bracelet (like a             Fitbit                  ) to requiring you to wear such a device?Facebook recently announced that it is trying to build \u201coptical neuroimaging systems\u201d that would allow users to direct their digital lives just by thinking. If Facebook succeeds in creating this brain-computer interface, will we really be prepared to welcome such corporate access to our very thoughts?Questions of privacy will soon bleed into the discussion of artificial intelligence. Google has already applied machine learning in its Google Assistant (currently available on Android phones), the Google Home speaker and Android Wear accessories like watches. As we become more dependent on voice-activated \u201cpersonal assistants,\u201d we will be turning over more intimate details of our lives for Google to mine for data. In late June, the company announced that it would stop reading customers\u2019 Gmail as a source of data for personalized advertisements\u2014while conceding that it has enough data on its users from other sources to continue placing highly targeted ads in Gmail.We shouldn\u2019t make too much of the fact that Alphabet dropped Google\u2019s early motto of \u201cDon\u2019t be evil,\u201d but we still need to ask if the barons of Silicon Valley are considering the moral framework of the digital revolution. Too often it seems that the driving principle behind much of big tech\u2019s dominance of the economy is Ayn Rand\u2019s radically libertarian rallying cry, \u201cWho is going to stop me?\u201d\u2018Very few politicians have been willing to grapple with the possibility of mass unemployment caused by artificial intelligence and robotics.\u2019The world beyond Silicon Valley needs to start giving serious attention to these issues. Very few politicians have been willing to grapple with the possibility of mass unemployment caused by AI and robotics, but others see clear policy implications. The AI investor Kai-Fu Lee suggests, for instance, that it is \u201cunavoidable that large chunks of the money created by A.I. will have to be transferred to those whose jobs have been displaced. This seems feasible only through Keynesian policies of increased government spending, presumably raised through taxation on wealthy companies.\u201dThe possibility for such a massive new welfare program seems dim in the current political climate, but we can\u2019t afford to ignore the problem, as Mr. Mnuchin suggests, or assume, like Mr. Andreessen, that millions of new jobs \u201cthat we can\u2019t even imagine\u201d will miraculously appear in the next 10 years. The elections of 2018 and beyond urgently need to address the troubling repercussions of the rise of the great tech monopolies.Part of the answer may be more aggressive antitrust enforcement. By imposing a $2.7 billion fine on Google in late June, the European Union made clear that its aim is to maintain competition in the marketplace. U.S. regulators have applied a less demanding standard, seeing harm to \u201cconsumer welfare\u201d as the only basis for action.The history of Silicon Valley itself offers some guidance here. The astonishing technological revolution of the past half-century would never have occurred without the impetus of three seminal antitrust prosecutions. In 1956,             AT&T                   signed a consent decree that forced it to license all of its Bell Labs patents (for such devices as the transistor, laser, cellular system, satellite and solar cell) to any American firm for free. From these technologies came firms like Fairchild Semiconductor,             Motorola,Texas Instruments,Intel                   and Comsat.In the 1970s, the Justice Department took on another tech giant, suing             IBM                   for its vertical monopoly in the computer business. The government didn\u2019t prevail in the 13-year-long prosecution, but IBM agreed to allow other companies to make the software for its computers. When the PC was being developed, IBM turned the development of its operating system over to two young men from Seattle,       Bill Gates       and       Paul Allen.       IBM still thought the core of its business was hardware, but the rise of Microsoft proved them wrong. The rest is history.And finally, the antitrust case against Microsoft in 1998 centered on the company\u2019s insistence that Windows customers had to use Microsoft\u2019s own Internet Explorer browser. Without the settlement, which meant that Internet Explorer would no longer be the exclusive browser, Google would have never risen to its current dominance.The clear historical lesson, which is waiting to be rediscovered in our own day, is that antitrust action has often served not to constrain innovation but to promote it.Mr. Taplin is the director emeritus of the Annenberg Innovation Lab at the University of Southern California and the author of \u201cMove Fast and Break Things: How Facebook, Google and Amazon Cornered Culture and Undermined Democracy\u201d (Little, Brown and Company).Appeared in the July 15, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-07-14 14:34:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/can-the-tech-giants-be-stopped-1500057243", "news_title": "Can the Tech Giants Be Stopped?", "keywords": "ai,amazon ,antitrust ,artificial intelligence,facebook,google,jonathan taplin,microsoft ,silicon valley,tech giants,Microsoft,MSFT,Google,GOOGL,Facebook,FB,Amazon.com,AMZN,anti-competition issues,labor,personnel,corporate,industrial news,economic news,political,general news,sciences,humanities,computers,consumer electronics,software,applications software,paper mills,retail,wholesale,etailing,internet search engines,basic materials,resources,computing,e-commerce,online service providers,media,entertainment,paper,pulp,social media platforms,tools,technology"}, {"content": "Wells Fargo        WFC 0.26%       & Co. reaped the benefits of higher interest rates in the second quarter, which helped push profit at the nation\u2019s third-largest bank up by 4.5%.The San Francisco-based bank\u2019s shares fell 2% in midday trading, however, as stagnant lending, weaker revenue in areas like mortgage banking and higher costs overshadowed progress on the bottom line.Shares in Wells Fargo and other big banks had been on a tear since the U.S. presidential election as investors wagered that the Trump administration would take a more cordial approach to regulating Wall Street and fostering growth. But with little change to either the economic outlook and policy toward banks, it is unclear when banks\u2019 earnings potential will catch up to their higher valuations.\u201cMuch of [the run-up in stocks] was probably aggressive or not fully warranted,\u201d said       John Shrewsberry,        Wells Fargo\u2019s finance chief, in an interview. \u201cThe realized outcome doesn\u2019t look any different than the realized outcome a year ago. So I think markets have to grapple with what does that actually mean.\u201dWells Fargo reported a profit of $5.81 billion, or $1.07 a share. That compares with $5.56 billion, or $1.01 a share, in the same period of 2016. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected earnings of $1.01 a share.The bank\u2019s results included a $186 million tax benefit during the second quarter, most of which was related to a deal it reached in June to sell its commercial insurance business. That boosted Wells Fargo\u2019s per-share earnings by 4 cents. Excluding this, the company\u2019s earnings would have come in at $1.03.Net interest income at the bank rose 6.4% to $12.48 billion from the same period last year. The rates Wells Fargo charges customers to borrow on credit cards, home equity lines of credit and other loan types vary along with the Federal Reserve\u2019s target, so the central bank\u2019s policy moves in recent months have directly improved banks\u2019 lending income.The bank\u2019s net interest margin, a measure of how profitably it can lend out its customers\u2019 deposits, rose to 2.9% from 2.86% last June, and its return on equity rose to 11.95% from 11.7%. The bank said it exercised discipline in repricing deposits, which helped them capture more of an increase in loan yields.The overall size of Wells Fargo\u2019s loan book stalled at $957 billion. During the quarter, the bank backed off making certain car loans and commercial real estate loans due to higher risk in those segments, executives said on a conference call with analysts.Wells Fargo\u2019s income from fees fell 7% to $9.69 billion, with several of its businesses facing challenges in the quarter. Mortgage-banking fee income fell 19% due in part to tougher competition, and net gains on the bank\u2019s trading activities fell 46% due in part to trading losses.The bank, led by Chief Executive       Timothy Sloan,        had been one of the most consistent big banks at growing earnings and revenue. Shares have underperformed those of other banks after Wells Fargo last year agreed to a $185 million settlement with two regulators and a city official over opening as many as 2.1 million accounts with fictitious or unauthorized information. It also continues to face a spate of state and federal investigations that the bank has said it is cooperating with.About $110 million in additional charges related to remedying Wells Fargo\u2019s operations following the sales-practice scandal contributed to a 5.2% increase in expenses, which totaled $13.54 billion in the quarter. Expenses as a share of revenue in the second quarter were 61.1%, slightly above the new target of 60% to 61% set at an investor presentation in May. That is also higher than the two-year target the bank set last year of 55% to 59%.\u201cThere\u2019s no reason why they can\u2019t manage their expenses better,\u201d said John Hadwen, a Toronto-based portfolio manager at CI Investments Inc. that owns about $315 million in Wells Fargo stock.\u201dThe market believes there\u2019s a lot more they can do there, and we\u2019re becoming impatient.\u201dIn May, the bank announced an initiative to cut an additional $2 billion in costs by the end of 2018.

In addition, cities have raised taxes on the car-sharing industry, but not the ride-hailing business.Avis Co.-owned Zipcar, the largest car-sharing operator, doesn\u2019t appear to be scaling back, but the overall industry in the U.S. is encountering hurdles to growth.\u201cOther shared services may both complement and compete with car sharing,\u201d says Susan Shaheen, co-director of the Transportation Sustainability Research Center at the University of California, Berkeley.Alternatives to traditional car ownership are expanding quickly, but it\u2019s still unclear which alternatives will prevail or how eager Americans are to forgo personal vehicles. In Europe, the biggest car-sharing market, the business continues to expand.There are 1.4 million members of car-sharing services in the U.S., according to the Transportation Sustainability Research Center. That number is expected to grow to 3 million by 2021 as infrastructure improves, cities become denser and policy makers promote multimodal transportation, CAR estimates.Global Market Insights, a market research and consulting firm, says the industry will reach $16.5 billion by 2024. The projections assume that existing companies add members and that new companies enter the market. However, upstarts face high initial expenses of acquiring a fleet, adapting to the needs of different cities and gaining brand recognition, according to CAR.The outlook is better for ride-hailing services such as Uber and Lyft Inc.             Goldman Sachs                   expects the hailing industry to balloon to $285 billion by 2030, from about $36 billion now, overtaking taxis in most global cities. Lyft tripled its rides from 53 million in 2015 to 160 million last year.Fleet management can be a big challenge for car-sharing operators. Unlike conventional car-rental services, with their closely monitored lots of cars for daily use, sharing services offer cars in unmonitored locations that can be secured via a smartphone app and borrowed for hours at a time.Enterprise\u2019s CarShare network recently suffered a lack of vehicle availability in Chicago due to \u201csignificant vandalism, theft and fraud.\u201d The company has decided to end car-sharing in Chicago and other cities, including San Francisco, Salt Lake City, Washington, and Boston, though it characterized the move as a \u201clong-term business decision\u201d that had more to do with weak demand than vandalism. CarShare continues to operate in 21 U.S. cities, the U.K. and Canada.Hertz Global Holdings Inc.       shut down its Hertz 24/7 sharing service in the U.S. in 2015.             Daimler AG\u2019sCar2Go program exited Miami, San Diego, and Minneapolis, although it continues to operate in Austin, Texas, Portland, Ore., New York City and other cities.Leah Jones, a 40-year-old marketing professional in Chicago, was a CarShare member for five years, using it roughly twice a month for grocery runs or doctor appointments.\u201cI don\u2019t have children or a suburban commute,\u201d Ms. Jones says, noting as well the costs of car ownership. Plus, in the city, a car \u201cwon\u2019t stay in good shape.\u201dHowever, after her area CarShare closed resulting in a lack of sharing options near her apartment, she says she may have no choice. \u201cI\u2019ve wondered if it\u2019s finally time to get a car.\u201dUndaunted, auto makers are investing in car sharing, including Volkswagen AG and             General Motors Co.       GM recently launched its Maven operation and is slowly expanding that car-sharing service to new markets.Andrew Daley, vice president of marketing at Zipcar, sees the expansion of transportation options, including new car-sharing services, as good for his business, as people rethink the need for personal cars.\u201cMore entrants are more reasons for people to think about car sharing,\u201d he says.Zipcar, which is 17 years old, counts 1 million members, 75% of whom are in the U.S. The business operates in 30 major metropolitan areas, with demand varying from city to city, Mr. Daley says.He says Zipcar continues to add members both in the U.S. and abroad, but the service expects competition to intensify, with a battle for the limited amount of parking spaces for shared cars potentially denting its performance.Write to Adrienne Roberts at Adrienne.Roberts@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-14 14:33:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/car-sharing-companies-hit-speed-bumps-as-demand-slows-ride-hailing-grows-1500024601", "news_title": "Car-Sharing Companies Hit Speed Bumps as Demand Slows, Ride-Hailing Grows", "keywords": "Enterprise Holdings,Uber Technologies,Zipcar,cars,political,general news,living,lifestyle,retail,wholesale,etailing,rental,leasing services,automobile rental,leasing,business,consumer services,e-commerce,online service providers,technology,sharing economy services"}, {"content": "A federal judge in Hawaii late\u00a0Thursday\u00a0loosened the terms of the temporary travel ban implemented by the       Trump       administration after a Supreme Court ruling last month.\u00a0Here are five takeaways from the latest legal twist:What exactly did the judge do?U.S. District Judge       Derrick Watson       in Honolulu was interpreting a June 26 interim ruling from the Supreme Court that said Mr. Trump could enforce part of his planned ban on travelers from six Muslim-majority counties.\u00a0The high court said the administration could enforce the ban against people who don\u2019t have ties to the U.S., but not against travelers with close connections to people or organizations in the U.S.When the Trump administration began implementing the ban\u00a0three days later, the state of Hawaii went back to Judge Watson\u2019s court\u2014which is where the case started\u2014and argued the White House was imposing a broader ban than the Supreme Court intended.\u00a0The judge agreed.Much of the immediate legal wrangling has been over what types of family relationships ought to make a traveler exempt from the ban.\u00a0The Trump administration said only the very closest family members were exempt, but Judge Watson said other relatives, such as grandparents, aunts and uncles, also should be exempt.Isn\u2019t the case pending with the Supreme Court?\u00a0How can the Hawaii judge get involved now?The Supreme Court last month announced it will give full consideration to the travel ban case in October, after it returns from a three-month break.\u00a0An eventual high-court ruling could resolve big issues about whether Mr. Trump\u2019s ban is on firm legal footing.\u00a0In the interim, the state of Hawaii contested how the Trump administration was applying the Supreme Court\u2019s rules.Judge Watson last week showed initial reluctance to intervene, saying the challengers needed to lodge their complaint directly with the Supreme Court.\u00a0But a day later, a federal appeals court said Judge Watson did have the authority to interpret and enforce what the Supreme Court said.\u00a0With that guidance in hand, Judge Watson issued\u00a0Thursday\u2019s\u00a0ruling that said the Trump administration\u2019s implementation violated the terms imposed by the Supreme Court.How can Judge Watson issue a ruling that affects the whole nation?Federal trial judges typically issue rulings that cover only the districts over which they preside, but in unusual circumstances they do issue orders that can have nationwide reach.\u00a0Judges have opted for that approach when concluding that limiting a ruling only to their specific district would be impracticable.Judge Watson has previously said a court order applying only in Hawaii wouldn\u2019t be workable, given that travelers come through an interconnected transit system and an array of ports of entry into the U.S. The judge originally issued a ruling in March that broadly blocked Mr. Trump\u2019s restrictions. An appeals court and the Supreme Court both found that parts of Judge Watson\u2019s original ruling went too far against the president.What are the Trump administration\u2019s options now?The Justice Department on Friday said it would seek immediate intervention from the Supreme Court on setting interim travel rules. It is possible the justices could move to act on the request even as they are dispersed for the summer.Even after Judge Watson\u2019s ruling, the Trump administration can enforce its ban against travelers and refugees without close connections to the U.S.\u00a0It isn\u2019t clear that there is a sizable pool of extended-family travelers who would be looking to come to the U.S. after the Hawaii judge\u2019s order.What happens when the Supreme Court returns in the fall?The justices could wade into the broader issues in the case, which involve some major questions about presidential power.\u00a0President Trump said his ban was need to keep the country safe from potential terrorist threats, but some lower courts have ruled the president used the ban to disfavor Muslims in a way that was likely unconstitutional.\u00a0Another court ruled that Mr. Trump hadn\u2019t provided adequate justification that the ban was needed.\u00a0The Supreme Court will be reviewing those decisions.It is possible, however, that the landscape could shift again before any high-court ruling. The 90-day ban will expire before the court\u2019s oral arguments in October, and the Trump team has been working on a study of world-wide vetting procedures.\u00a0With that study in hand, Mr. Trump could move to issue new and potentially broader restrictions that supersede the current ban.\u00a0That potentially could moot the Supreme Court case.\u00a0At the very least, it would add a new layer of complexity.Write to Brent Kendall at brent.kendall@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-14 14:26:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/five-takeaways-from-hawaii-judges-ruling-on-trumps-travel-ban-1500053148", "news_title": "Five Takeaways From Hawaii Judge\u2019s Ruling on Trump\u2019s Travel Ban ", "keywords": " hawaii judge, immigrants, muslim ban, muslim countries, supreme court, travel ban,trump travel ban, visas,political,general news,national,public security,crime,legal action,politics,international relations,domestic politics,state security measures,policies,government bodies,executive branch,judicial branch"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014A Hawaii judge late Thursday ordered a nationwide loosening of President Donald Trump\u2019s temporary ban on U.S. entry for some travelers from six Muslim-majority countries, ruling the administration\u2019s strict approach contradicted a recent Supreme Court ruling.The decision is a fresh legal blow for the president just two weeks after a Supreme Court ruling allowed the administration to implement its travel ban against refugees and foreign nationals from six countries who have no connection to the U.S.Capital Journal is WSJ.com\u2019s home for politics, policy and national security news.The justices said Mr. Trump\u2019s administration couldn\u2019t enforce the ban against people with bona fide relationships to people or organizations in the U.S. Days after, the Trump administration adopted a narrow view of what relationships counted for an exemption from the ban.The Justice Department said Friday it would ask the Supreme Court to overturn the judge.\u201cThe Supreme Court has had to correct this lower court once, and we will now reluctantly return directly to the Supreme Court to again vindicate the rule of law and the executive branch\u2019s duty to protect the nation,\u201d Attorney General Jeff Sessions said.Administration officials said visa applicants and refugees with U.S.-based spouses, children, parents and siblings would be allowed in. But those with only lesser ties\u2014such as grandparents, grandchildren, aunts, uncles and cousins\u2014would be subject to the ban.U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson in Hawaii took issue with that interpretation. He issued an order late Thursday, which applies nationwide, that says people with broader family ties are also exempt from the ban.\u201cThe Government\u2019s definition of close familial relationship is not only not compelled by the Supreme Court\u2019s June 26 decision, but contradicts it,\u201d the judge wrote.Mr. Trump\u2019s restrictions sought to impose a 90-day ban on U.S. entry for people from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen, and to suspend temporarily the U.S. program for admitting refugees. Mr. Trump has said the order would help prevent terrorism and allow his administration time to study vetting procedures world-wide.Thursday\u2019s order, like previous decisions in the legal saga, wasn\u2019t a final ruling on the ban, but instead a decision on what rules should be in place while litigation continues over whether Mr. Trump\u2019s restrictions are legal.The Supreme Court will give the case a full airing in October, and it intended its June ruling to strike a balance in the meantime, allowing Mr. Trump to bar some travel, but not for people with close connections to the U.S., such as with family, schools and employers.Judge Watson said the Trump administration\u2019s ban implementation after the high court ruling tilted the scale too far in its favor and against those travelers with U.S. family connections. He ordered that the ban not apply to \u201cgrandparents, grandchildren, brothers-in-law, sisters-in-law, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, and cousins of persons in the United States.\u201d\u201cCommon sense, for instance, dictates that close family members be defined to include grandparents. Indeed, grandparents are the epitome of close family members,\u201d the judge wrote.Judge Watson also loosened some Trump administration restrictions on what type of U.S. relationships qualify to exempt refugees from the ban. The judge said refugees aren\u2019t subject to the ban if they are covered by a formal admissions agreement between the U.S. government and a refugee resettlement agency.Lawyer Neal Katyal, who is representing Hawaii in its challenge to the Trump travel ban, on Twitter called the ruling a sweeping victory.The Justice Department had argued the Trump administration\u2019s implementation of the ban was faithful with the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling. It also argued that only the high court should be able to clarify or modify its ruling.Write to Brent Kendall at brent.kendall@wsj.comAppeared in the July 14, 2017, print edition as 'Judge Exempts Some in Travel Ban.'", "news_time": "2017-07-14 14:24:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/hawaii-judge-orders-loosening-of-trump-travel-ban-1500004506", "news_title": "Hawaii Judge Orders Loosening of Trump Travel Ban ", "keywords": "hawaii judge,travel ban exemptions,travel ban grandparents,trump immigration,trump travel ban,political,general news,national,public security,crime,legal action,migration,politics,international relations,domestic politics,state security measures,policies,government bodies,executive branch,judicial branch,legal services,business,consumer services,immigration,naturalization services"}, {"content": "With the first tank battles and widespread aerial bombings, World War I was the first modern war\u2014and the first modernist war, as members of Europe\u2019s prewar avant-garde traded in their paintbrushes and alienation for bayonets and patriotism. By war\u2019s end, these artists were often leaving behind haunted, harrowing antiwar pictures that have shaped how that conflict has been viewed ever since.As the war\u2019s centenary continues, New York\u2019s Metropolitan Museum of Art has gathered some of the conflict\u2019s vast and varied images in \u201cWorld War I and the Visual Arts.\u201d The show, featuring some 130 works, opens on July 31.The art ranges from pieces by German masters       Max Beckmann       and       Otto Dix      \u2014who both volunteered for war service\u2014to anonymous war-themed trading cards distributed in American cigarette packs. What nearly all these figures have in common is that they expressed themselves on paper. The medium, Met curator       Jennifer Farrell       points out, let artists sketch while they were at the front and was the usual format for war propaganda. Just after the war, she adds, artists made antiwar prints, allowing for a wider public than the gallery crowd who came for paintings.In the first of four chronologically organized galleries, a quasi-religious, patriotic print from 1914 by       Natalia Goncharova,        a doyenne of the Russian avant-garde, shows Russian soldiers being blessed by angels. Early on, many artists viewed the war as having \u201cspiritual potential,\u201d Ms. Farrell says, citing figures like       Wassily Kandinsky,        who thought the war could free society from the strictures of materialism.Otto Dix was a Dresden art student when the war broke out. He eagerly enlisted, saw heavy fighting and eventually received an Iron Cross. In the early weeks, \u201centhusiasm for the war happened among Europe\u2019s artists, but not among the general population,\u201d says       Jay Winter,        Charles J. Stille professor of history emeritus at Yale. The artists, he thinks, \u201cwere people who were marginalized\u201d in their societies, and the war \u201cbrought them into the center...They fell for it\u2014and they were later embarrassed by what they had done.\u201dAfter the war Dix became one of the war\u2019s most ferocious critics when he began to catalog its horrors in retrospect. In the last gallery, the Met will display all 51 prints from \u201cThe War,\u201d Dix\u2019s 1920s series of etchings filled with decomposing bodies and destroyed landscapes.Some of the works in the show were created in the field. Taken from an airplane, an       Edward Steichen       photo shows how Germany\u2019s long-range artillery obliterated a French village. Ms. Farrell says that Steichen, in charge of the American military photography unit, probably didn\u2019t regard the photo as a work of art\u2014but it \u201creveals his skill.\u201dGermany\u2019s       K\u00e4the Kollwitz       is represented with three grief-stricken postwar works. The artist, opposed before the war to Germany\u2019s militarist regime, encouraged her husband to allow their son to speed up his enlistment in 1914, says Prof. Winter. The young man died within weeks. \u201cShe spent 30 years regretting that moment,\u201d Prof. Winter says. Kollwitz\u2019s \u201cThe Parents,\u201d an early 1920s woodcut, shows a couple convulsed in mourning.While the Met show emphasizes European artists, a concurrent exhibition at the New-York Historical Society confines itself to Americans. \u201cWorld War I Beyond the Trenches\u201d features 100 artworks, objects and documents, including John Singer Sargent\u2019s \u201cGassed,\u201d a near life-size 1919 painting showing wounded soldiers making their way toward a field hospital. Meanwhile, the Met will include a 1918 Sargent watercolor, \u201cWheels in Vault,\u201d inspired by his trip with the British army as an official war artist.The Society also has on view an inflammatory 1917 American recruitment poster, reading \u201cDestroy This Mad Brute,\u201d showing a German soldier devolved into what could be called a militarist gorilla. It was created by       Harry Ryle Hopp      s, who went on to become an art director in Hollywood. During the war, \u201cimages of a vicious, racially deformed enemy\u201d became a mainstay on both sides, says Prof. Winter. After the war, German right-wing paramilitary groups repurposed the images as anti-Semitic propaganda, paving the way for the Nazis. The Met also is showing a copy of \u201cBrute.\u201dThe Met has to itself four helmet prototypes created by some of its own.       Bashford Dean,        the museum\u2019s early 20th-century curator of arms and armor, was sought out by the Army after the U.S. entered the war in the spring of 1917. He became a commissioned major and partnered with the museum\u2019s master armorer to develop body armor.None of the helmets saw combat, says       Donald J.

The advantages of this are obvious, but two issues of importance need to be considered. Those elderly individuals most likely to have multiple, complex, chronic illnesses, which would be particularly suited to technological approaches, are often least able to interact with technology advances. They may not have smartphones or use email. Second, neither technology nor artificial intelligence will ever replace the value of a caring physician who knows the patient, listens intently and builds a trusting, healing relationship. This requires time, the missing ingredient in America\u2019s highly dysfunctional health-care-delivery system.Stephen C. Schimpff, M.D.Catonsville, Md.Dr. Topol oversells technological prospects both for containing health-care costs and for correcting perceived deficiencies in the system. He asserts that the answer to the long average wait time to see a primary-care physician is to introduce telemedicine visits. As a busy internist, I can see only a finite number of patients a day regardless of whether that visit takes place electronically or in person. Even so, relying solely on patients with no medical training to accurately obtain and transmit complex medical information is simply too prone to error and will inevitably lead to incorrect diagnoses. I doubt the average trial lawyer will forgive me for using diagnostic information that was incorrectly reported by a patient through an internet connection.Adam Ralko, M.D.Clayton, Mo.My employees face increasing deductibles and copays that force them to shop for medical services, but they are unable to do so because transparency doesn\u2019t exist in the health-care industry. Without cost transparency, there is no competition between hospitals and other health-care providers and therefore no financial incentive for any of them to seek more reasonably priced equipment and drugs for their patients. While Republican congressmen loudly threaten us with a single-payer system if we don\u2019t support their health-care bill, by focusing on the cost of insurance rather than the cost of services, they ignore the fact that the inefficiencies of noncompetitive, government-controlled pricing already are mirrored in our system. Congressmen who suggest bipartisan action should be able to introduce an uncomplicated bill requiring providers to publish their itemized costs of service. The result will be price transparency, the prerequisite of competition in any free market.Richard D. RogovinBlacklick, OhioI don\u2019t share the optimism that technology will cure the ills of our health-care system. None of the technologies described will encourage population health. Show me a device that will get a patient to quit smoking, eat better or exercise more. As for the use of biomarkers to tailor medications for patients, the pharmaceutical companies profit every time a patient fills a prescription, regardless of whether it benefits the patient or causes a side effect. Understandably, they will be reluctant to develop or manufacture drugs if a large number of potential patients won\u2019t be prescribed the medication if their biomarkers don\u2019t make them candidates. And while genomics holds great potential, consider the \u201cdark side\u201d of knowing that you may develop a chronic disease. This type of information would make certain people uninsurable (the ultimate pre-existing condition). Finally, as for the potential to use big data and AI, we physicians already are drowning in a sea of data that we cannot interpret or use. Thanks to PQRS, MIPS, MACRA and the alphabet soup of governmental quality programs doctors must comply with, I now generate a four-page single-spaced document for a patient with an ear infection. So little of the data we collect is clinically meaningful, I cannot imagine if I had to download a month\u2019s worth of a patient\u2019s vital signs and look it over at each visit.Jason Acevedo, M.D.Abilene, TexasOn behalf of the 35 million Americans who live alone, I take issue with the inaccurate fantasy of patients returning home to \u201csleep in their own beds, surrounded by family.\u201d Everyone who can avoid nosocomial infections appreciates doing so; ditto a night uninterrupted by nurses or technicians waking one every hour, not to mention the noise and light that prevent rest, let alone sleep, in most hospitals. But going directly home following surgery or other hospitalization is no picnic. Discharge instructions that require changing dressings and/or a complicated drug regimen are challenging for those who may be squeamish, unskilled, whose organizational skills may be poor or temporarily impaired by illness or injury.The 10 days following discharge from a surgery were among the worst in my life, with unanticipated side effects of new drugs leading to avoidable injuries, and with the community incurring costs related to follow-up care for these injuries: a 911 call, the physician\u2019s services and expensive medical tests. For those of us who aren\u2019t surrounded by family, better solutions are needed.Susan L. GoldenClevelandI agree that we need to adopt the tools of information-age medicine to contain costs and improve results, but our health-care system won\u2019t be fixed without insurance reform. We need both smart medicine and smart insurance reform.

The ratings also ease concerns around the corporate governance of the bank, he added.Set up in January 2016, the AIIB currently has 80 members, among them Canada, Germany and the U.K. Its mandate is to finance and co-finance international infrastructure projects. For that, the bank has around $9 billion at its disposal, plus another $73.6 billion in callable capital at the end of March. A total of 17 projects with funding needs totaling $2.8 billion has been approved.The U.S. hasn\u2019t joined the AIIB.Fitch stated that Thursday\u2019s rating is based on both existing and expected strengths. The AIIB \u201chas been endowed with a substantial capital base which will support the projected rapid expansion in lending,\u201d according to a statement by the rating agency.The AIIB doesn\u2019t have a domestic credit rating in China yet, Mr. Elbech said. The bank is now looking to register its bond and swap documents, to put IT systems in place and to grow the number of employees in its treasury department to 13 from four.It now plans to take the steps required for its first bond issuance. Mr. Elbech said it is too early to say how much the AIIB could raise.The AIIB\u2019s sister bank, the New Development Bank in Shanghai, is also seeking international credit ratings. Both banks, alongside the so-called New Silk Road Fund, are part of a push by the Chinese government to increase its standing in international financial markets\u2014and to challenge Western incumbents like the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.The NDB is\u2014albeit smaller and equipped with less capital\u2014aiming for a similar rating. \u201cWe want to have a solid investment-grade rating,\u201d finance chief Leslie Maasdorp said. \u201cA higher rating allows you to provide big infrastructure loans at a competitive cost.\u201dThe task however appears more challenging, as three of its five founding members\u2014Brazil, Russia and South Africa\u2014have lost their investment grade credit rating.\u201cThis could impact the NDB\u2019s credit rating and require more paid-in capital,\u201d said Horst L\u00f6chel, a professor at the Frankfurt School of Finance & Management.Mr. Maasdorp denies this. \u201cThe fact that the international credit ratings of South Africa, Russia and Brazil have gone down will not have a material impact on the NDB,\u201d he said.He said he was given assurance by international credit credit-rating firms\u2014the names of which he did not to provide\u2014that they would place less emphasis on the credit ratings of the founding members.The NDB currently has paid-in capital of $2.8 billion, a figure that is set to rise to $10 billion within the next five years.

The Clark Art Institute\u2019s current show \u201cOrchestrating Elegance: Alma-Tadema and Design\u201d (through Sept. 4) cogently examines high-Victorian painting and decorative art as well as Classical mythology, British and American social history, collecting, connoisseurship, and even the music surrounding the creation of one of the most opulent private rooms to grace old New York\u2014the music room in the New York mansion of the music-loving financier and noted collector       Henry Marquand       (1819-1902) a founder of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. It was designed by one of Victorian England\u2019s most esteemed painters,       Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema       (1836-1912), and its centerpiece was a Steinway grand piano lavishly ornamented to Alma-Tadema\u2019s specifications.Acquired by the Clark in 1997, the piano is one of the museum\u2019s finest works of decorative art, and the show\u2019s co-curators,       Kathleen M. Morris       (Clark director of collections and exhibitions) and       Alexis Goodin       (curatorial research associate), have exhaustively reassembled many of the elaborate seating and cabinet pieces that originally complemented it, along with a wealth of material that vividly sets the original design project in its artistic and historical context.Dutch-born Alma-Tadema achieved international acclaim for his lush, meticulously researched and detailed genre scenes of ancient Greece and Rome. The show includes several choice Alma-Tadema canvases, exemplifying his elegant, anecdotal imagery and his gift for rendering beautiful skin tones, complex drapery, luminous marble architecture and varied qualities of Mediterranean light. Such vibrant realist paintings subsequently influenced early Hollywood directors like       D.W. Griffith       and       Cecil B. DeMille.       And although the artist was not a professional decorator, the fame of his studio decorations and the detailed archaeological knowledge he poured into his paintings led Marquand to commission Alma-Tadema to design a room for private concerts that would also serve as a sympathetic backdrop to his own collection of artifacts.Alma-Tadema\u2019s Greco-Pompeian designs for Marquand required some three years to complete by the London firm of Johnstone, Norman & Co. They feature carved ebony and cedar with elaborately carved inlays of boxwood, ivory, abalone, coral and mother-of-pearl. Two important Alma-Tadema paintings that hung in the room are included in the show.The piano alone was thought to have cost Marquand the modern equivalent of $1.25 million\u2014price was apparently no object. Shipped by Steinway to London from New York with a plain cherry-veneered case, it was thereafter veneered in ebony and decorated to Alma-Tadema\u2019s designs.The front legs are carved with massive winged lions, a favorite archaeological motif of the artist, inspired by the carved-stone table supports in one of the celebrated ruins in Pompeii. The piano cover is inlaid with polychrome wreath designs encircling the names of Apollo and the nine Muses in Greek characters of ivory and mother-of-pearl. While the music racks of most high-style Victorian pianos were of elaborately carved and pierced wood, this one is fashioned of chased and engraved copper, brass and silver, with a delicate pierce-work surround of brass scrollwork and palmettes.Apart from the liberal use of inlaid marquetry inside and out, and the subtle relief effects of the carved and inlaid botanical motifs, certain features are designed as charming architectural miniatures\u2014the exceptionally heavy piano lid requires two supports when open, both fashioned as complementary Roman columns. The lyre post, holding the pedals, is a miniature Propylaeum\u2014a Greco-Roman temple entrance\u2014its two Doric columns supporting a detailed entablature.For the finishing touch, in 1886 Alma-Tadema enlisted fellow neoclassical painter (and future Royal Academy president) Sir Edward Poynter (1836-1919) to paint the inner surface of the keyboard cover. Poynter called his jewel-like scene of Pompeian dancers and musicians \u201cWandering Minstrels,\u201d possibly a sly allusion to Nanki-Poo\u2019s song in Gilbert and Sullivan\u2019s immensely popular operetta \u201cThe Mikado,\u201d which had its premiere in London in March 1885.Alma-Tadema had the underside of the piano lid fitted with removable parchment sheets on which musical or theatrical lions could sign their names. Among the first to do so were       W.S. Gilbert       and Sir Arthur Sullivan, who signed while the piano was in London prior to shipment to Marquand. Other luminaries followed suit in Marquand\u2019s home, including       Theodore Thomas,        the founding conductor of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra;       Anton Seidl,        the Metropolitan Opera and New York Philharmonic conductor; and       Victor Herbert,        the cellist and composer of \u201cBabes in Toyland.\u201dAfter Marquand\u2019s death in 1902, and the sale and dispersal of his mansion\u2019s contents, the piano eventually spent five decades in New York\u2019s       Martin Beck       (now       Al Hirschfeld      ) Theatre, where it was autographed by several Broadway celebrities, most notably composer       Richard Rodgers       and playwright and producer       Larry Gelbart.       At the Clark exhibition, a gallery invites visitors to listen to recordings of       Liszt       pupil       Arthur Friedheim,        an important concert pianist at the turn of the 20th century, who once played the Marquand piano. A video of recent performances of       Chopin       and Herbert selections on this singular musical instrument proves that its appeal is not just ornamental.\u2014Mr. Scherer writes about music and the fine arts for the Journal.", "news_time": "2017-07-14 13:42:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/ornate-design-that-strikes-an-elegant-note-1500054137", "news_title": "Ornate Design That Strikes an Elegant Note", "keywords": "arts in review, design,greco-roman, henry marquand, lawrence alma-tadema, piano, steinway,Henry Marquand,Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema,art,political,general news,arts,entertainment"}, {"content": "The number of rigs drilling for oil in the U.S. rose by two in the past week to 765, according to oil-field services company             Baker Hughes Inc.The U.S. oil-rig count is typically viewed as a proxy for activity in the sector.

Canada\u2019s Ontario Teachers\u2019 Pension Plan and OMERS Administration Corp. acquired the operator of the 109-kilometer (nearly 68 miles) HS1 rail link in 2010 from the U.K. government in a deal that valued HS1 at \u00a32.1 billion, including debt. The InfraRed-Equitix deal values HS1 at more than \u00a33 billion, including debt, according to a person familiar with the matter.The competitive sale highlights the strong\u2014some say overheating\u2014demand for infrastructure projects as a way for pensions, sovereign-wealth funds and other institutional investors to boost returns and diversify their holdings.It also underlines the greater risk of investors overpaying to beat out bidders for coveted assets.HS1 holds a concession to own and operate the High Speed 1 rail-service link that connects London St. Pancras International railway station located in the heart of London with the Eurostar tunnel, another high-speed rail connection that runs under the English Channel between Britain and continental Europe. Eurostar, which started running passenger trains in 1994, is popular with millions of tourists and business travelers as a way to cut travel times and airport hassle. The HS1 concession expires at the end of 2040.The winning consortium comprises             HICL Infrastructure Co.

That demand helped infrastructure funds raise a record $59 billion last year for a total of $137 billion to invest as of the end of 2016, according to data provider Preqin.More traditional private-equity funds, looking to tap that investor appetite, are also targeting infrastructure. In May,             Blackstone Group                   LP announced plans to raise $40 billion for a new infrastructure fund. Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund is seeding Blackstone\u2019s fund with a $20 billion commitment. U.S. President       Donald Trump       has spoken of plans for $1 trillion of investment to upgrade the nation\u2019s roads, highways and other public works.Still, strong investment demand and the growing pile of cash to invest risks pushing prices higher unless the number of potential targets grows. While the number of infrastructure deals rose about 2% to 1,774 in 2016, total deal value gained almost 16% to $645 billion, according to Preqin.\u201cDespite strong returns in recent years, there are concerns from all players in the infrastructure industry about competition for assets pushing up pricing and eating into eventual returns,\u201d Preqin said in its 2017 global infrastructure report.Write to Ben Dummett at ben.dummett@wsj.comAppeared in the July 15, 2017, print edition as 'U.K. Rail Operator Is Sold for $1.2 Billion.'", "news_time": "2017-07-14 13:24:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/consortium-wins-race-for-britains-high-speed-rail-link-operator-hs1-ltd-1500053074", "news_title": "Consortium Wins Race for Britain\u2019s High-Speed Rail-Link Operator HS1", "keywords": "acquisition,britain,canada,dalmore capital ltd.,equitix investment management ltd.,high-speed rail link,hs1 ltd.,infrared capital partners,infrastructure projects,london st. pancras international railway station,omers administration corp.,ontario teachers' pension plan,pension funds,railway,sale,sovereign wealth funds,u.k.,InfraRed Capital Partners,Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan,HICL Infrastructure,HICL.LN,UK:HICL,Equitix Investment Management,HS1,U.K. government,OMERS Administration,London St. Pancras International,plans,strategy,ownership changes,acquisitions,mergers,shareholdings,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,supply chain,political,general news,personal finance,transport,railroads,trusts,funds,financial vehicles,private equity,alternative investments,financial services,investing,securities,public pension funds,road,rail transport,railroad passenger transport,sovereign wealth fund,transportation,logistics"}, {"content": "No other 19th-century American writer manages to annoy today\u2019s readers like       Henry David Thoreau.

Its author\u2014the self-appointed chanticleer intent on rousing his somnambulant readers\u2014retreated to Walden Pond in the mid-1840s, constructing a small cabin near its sandy shores and, after two years, returning with a simple message: You are wasting your life trying to be like others. In sentences honed to a lacerating edge, Thoreau sliced away at Americans\u2019 faith in technology, their tendency toward distraction, their unthinking materialism. For more than a century and a half, the readers of \u201cWalden\u201d have responded defensively by accusing him of hypocrisy, misanthropy, poor social skills and general loutishness.In her richly rewarding \u201cHenry David Thoreau: A Life,\u201d Laura Dassow Walls rescues Thoreau (whose 200th birthday was on July 12) from the caricatures that have adhered to him since his most famous work was published. Ms. Walls\u2019s Thoreau is less the irascible hermit and sanctimonious scold than a sociable, curious, passionate writer deeply involved in his time and place. We see him planting a garden as a honeymoon present for Nathaniel and Sophia Hawthorne, mourning the death of his beloved older brother, even falling in love. The result is a deeply humane thinker who seems more relevant than ever.By Laura Dassow WallsChicago, 615 pages, $35With few exceptions, Thoreau spent all of his days in Concord, Mass., a village of 4,000 souls whose citizenry included       Ralph Waldo Emerson,        Hawthorne and       Louisa May Alcott.       \u201cNever was a poor, little country village infested with such a variety of queer, strangely dressed, oddly behaved mortals,\u201d Hawthorne remarked of the town\u2019s starry-eyed Transcendentalists, among whom Thoreau counted himself. Some of the most enjoyable portions of Ms. Walls\u2019s biography are its scenes of village life, with the inevitable personal squabbles, political disputes and eccentricities.In \u2018Walden,\u2019 Henry David Thoreau boasted about scrutinizing the farms around his native Concord, Mass., vicariously owning all of them through the power of imagination. The remark reveals the way he used intense observation to stake his claim on the world, inviting readers to do the same. That sensibility rests at the heart of \u201cThoreau\u2019s Animals\u201d (Yale, 256 pages, $30), an assortment of his musings on Concord\u2019s creatures great and small.The possessive in the title points to Thoreau\u2019s proprietary interest in the birds and beetles, bobcats and bees, toads and turtles and voles that came under his gaze. For Thoreau, these wonders of creation weren\u2019t passive presences in his landscape but a living library as intimate as the books on his shelf. He watched wildlife to make it his own.Following a format similar to last year\u2019s \u201cThoreau\u2019s Wildflowers,\u201d which he also produced, editor Geoff Wisner has combed through Thoreau\u2019s two-million-word journal for material. As distilled by Mr. Wisner, some of the selections have the opaque spareness of haiku: \u201cI hear the night-singing bird breaking out as in his dreams, made so from the first for some mysterious reason.\u201d Others are prose equivalents of stroboscopic photographs: \u201cAs I walked through the pasture side of the hill, saw a deer mouse or two glance before me in faint galleries in the grass. They are seldom seen, for these small deer, like the larger, disappear suddenly as if they had exploded before your eyes.\u201d Such entries remind us that Thoreau\u2019s journal was his workshop, a place to record impressions that sometimes seem more like brainstorms than fully realized ideas. But the improvisational quality of \u201cThoreau\u2019s Animals\u201d is also its biggest charm. Thoreau was a self-styled reporter on the natural world, and his prose hums with the urgency of a scribe on deadline. Pencil illustrations by nature artist Debby Cotter Kaspari give a similar sense of immediacy. In her picture of the deer mouse, reproduced above and typical of her style, the strokes register as boldly as a seismograph\u2019s.\u201cThe sound of the crickets even in the spring makes our hearts beat with its awful reproof . . . it seems irretrievably late,\u201d Thoreau wrote in August 1853, less than a decade before his death. \u201cThe year is full of warnings of its shortness, as is life.\u201d In this way, \u201cThoreau\u2019s Animals\u201d celebrates paying attention as humanity\u2019s highest duty\u2014and its deepest source of pleasure.\u2014Mr. Heitman, a columnist for the Advocate in Baton Rouge, is the author of \u201cA Summer of Birds: John James Audubon at Oakley House.\u201dThe town\u2019s most famous inhabitant, Emerson, was either the best or the worst thing that ever happened to Thoreau. A constant supporter of his acolyte\u2019s literary ambitions, Emerson published Thoreau\u2019s early work and allowed him to build his famous cabin on land that he owned near Walden Pond. He also invited Thoreau to live with his family and gave him access to his extensive library. But Emerson was a forceful personality, a cultural icon who tended to eclipse nearly everyone he met. He misguidedly encouraged Thoreau to become a poet and failed to fully grasp the younger man\u2019s talents for natural observation. Thoreau\u2019s life was in many ways a heroic, decadeslong struggle to both honor and escape the influence of his more famous friend.He did that in part by taking his mentor\u2019s suggestions to an extreme. If Emerson began his career with a slim volume titled \u201cNature,\u201d Thoreau devoted four hours a day to exploring the woods and pasture surrounding Concord. One of his gifts was to view this familiar environment as terra incognita, chronicling his daily encounters with nature as though he were       Mungo Park       or       Alexander von Humboldt.       As Ms. Walls tells it, from this habit arose one of Thoreau\u2019s most acute insights: that to know one place exhaustively is to glimpse the cosmos.Today we would say that he acted locally and thought globally. Thoreau kept up with the science of his day and, in his spare time, compiled a dozen or so notebooks devoted to Native American history and lore. He invented a way to improve the production of his family\u2019s pencil business and carefully traced       Charles Darwin\u2019s       journey around the globe as recounted in the naturalist\u2019s \u201cVoyage of the Beagle.\u201d He relived the battles and political debates of the ancient Greek and Roman societies (he could read both languages) and delved into Eastern philosophy and religion, eventually acquiring the most comprehensive library of non-Western thought in the nation.In \u201cWalden,\u201d Thoreau declared with Zen-like serenity that the goal of life was to inhabit the \u201cnick of time,\u201d or that \u201cmeeting of two eternities, the past and future, which is precisely the present moment.\u201d But as Ms. Walls shows, this insistence upon mindfulness was largely a response to his living on the cusp of modernity. Thoreau decamped to Walden Pond just as a major revolution in industry and technology was reshaping American life, eroding a centuries-old agrarian society and ushering in a fast-paced urban world whose contours remain with us today. While Thoreau lived at the pond, a railroad between Concord and Fitchburg was built beside the pond, and its string of freight and passenger cars ruffled the water\u2019s surface several times a day. The wilderness that Thoreau extolled in \u201cWalden\u201d was already a memory by the time he finished the book in 1854.Equally troubling for the author was the condition of the nation\u2019s less fortunate inhabitants. Thoreau was a vocal advocate for the impoverished Irish immigrants who moved to Concord to work on the railroad, and he was an especially ardent abolitionist. He helped his radical mother and sisters shelter runaway slaves, solicited contributions for a variety of antislavery projects, and conversed with many of the leading abolitionist thinkers of the day, including       Charles Sumner,        Lewis Hayden and       Frederick Douglass.These examples suggest why scholars have long divided the author into two distinct personas: the proto-environmentalist who extolled the virtues of the wild and the political dissenter whose \u201cCivil Disobedience\u201d (1849) served as an inspirational text for the civil-rights movement. Ms. Walls attempts to reconcile these two by suggesting that Thoreau believed \u201cthat attention to the natural environment confronted the root of all political evil.\u201d By conceiving all living beings as interconnected, in other words, Thoreau was especially attuned to social injustice. Perhaps. But it is equally possible that, like most of us, he was a bundle of contradictions, a collection of competing impulses that responded to given situations less from philosophical systematizing than from the psychological requirements of the moment.If we tend to see the two years at Walden as the heart of Thoreau\u2019s career, Ms. Walls\u2019s biography reveals a rich and varied life after that experience had been transformed into art. The list of Thoreau\u2019s accomplishments following his experiment in simple living is astonishing and include his becoming a world-class expert on geology and Native American ethnography, a politically engaged speaker who swayed public opinion about the abolitionist       John Brown,        and one of the first authors on either side of the Atlantic to adopt Darwinian ideas.Past scholars have tended to see the period after 1854 as a falling off\u2014the end of Thoreau\u2019s career as a writer. But Ms. Walls convincingly shows that Thoreau\u2019s journals are his second great masterpiece. Here Thoreau finally overcame the influence of Emerson to become a meticulous observer of natural phenomena. He compiled information about more than 100 tree and 60 shrub species, described the height of grasses, the size of red maple leaves in May, the dates during which the \u201cleaves of goldenrod [are] obvious.\u201d He recorded the growth of fir trees and the leafing-out dates ofthe fever bush, waxwork, red cedar, tupelo, red currant and poison sumac. He noted the day on which \u201cchicadees have winter ways.\u201dWhat exactly was he up to? The simple answer is that we don\u2019t entirely know. But the painstaking work he began in the 1850s enabled Thoreau to capture and quantify the process of growth and death in nature and to gradually become a philosopher-scientist who discerned some of nature\u2019s interrelated processes. He made dazzling associative insights, determining before anyone else, for example, why pine trees grew where oak forests had been cut down, and vice versa. More important, and unlike nearly every other thinker of the mid-19th century, he came to believe that people were an intrinsic part of nature\u2014neither separate nor alienated from it. Two hundred years after his birth, Thoreau remains the American author who most anticipates our present understanding of the reciprocal relationship between humans and the natural world.He died at age 44 of tuberculosis, leaving the voluminous project of his journals incomplete. But Emerson, always in the advance, understood their value long before scholars did. Grieving over his friend\u2019s premature death, he compared the ambitious and dazzling intellectual acrobatics in Thoreau\u2019s journals to a gymnast\u2019s \u201cleap, climb & swing.\u201d Thoreau\u2019s insights into the natural world, he wrote, possessed \u201ca force unapproachable.\u201dDespite the naysayers, that force is still with us. While \u201cWalden\u201d continues to inspire any number of contemporary movements, such as \u201csimple living\u201d and \u201cminimalism,\u201d Ms. Walls suggests how the later Thoreau might come to resonate most powerfully in the 21st century. This Thoreau abandoned much of Emerson\u2019s Transcendentalist philosophizing and focused instead on the deep interconnections of nature and culture. He seems to have become increasingly aware that human beings had become a geological force capable of changing the natural environment by denuding forests or converting wetlands to arable property. In recent years, climate scientists have used the meticulous observations of the later journals to determine that spring arrives nearly three weeks earlier in Concord than it did 150 ago. If the Thoreau beyond \u201cWalden\u201d is an author for our time, then Laura Dassow Walls is his biographer.\u2014Mr. Fuller is the Herman Melville Distinguished Professor of 19th-Century American Literature at the University of Kansas.", "news_time": "2017-07-14 13:10:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/thoreau-at-200-1500052255", "news_title": "Thoreau at 200", "keywords": "bookcar0715,book review,recommended books,books,political,general news,society,community,arts,entertainment,forced labor,human rights,civil liberties,poverty,social issues,reviews"}, {"content": "FRANKFURT\u2014As the European Central Bank moves toward phasing out its stimulus, evidence of a robust eurozone economy is emerging to suggest the program has achieved its aim.Two-and-a-half years into the ECB\u2019s controversial bond-buying program, known as quantitative easing, the eurozone economy is the strongest it has been since before the global financial crisis. It has grown by 3.6% since the start of QE and created more than four million jobs, according to the ECB.Data to be released over the coming weeks\u2014including second-quarter growth figures on Aug. 16\u2014are likely to be \u201cremarkable,\u201d said Ken Wattret, an economist with TS Lombard in London.Against that backdrop, the ECB\u2019s aggressive stimulus, comprising subzero interest rates and bond purchases of \u20ac60 billion ($68.5 billion) a month, looks increasingly excessive.\u201cThe news flow will be a strong reinforcement of the case that something needs to be done\u201d by the ECB, Mr. Wattret said.Nevertheless, investors appeared to be caught off-guard when ECB President Mario Draghi signaled last month that the central bank might respond to the improved economic outlook by reducing its monetary stimulus. Critics of such a move stress that the ECB targets not growth but inflation, which remains too weak. The ECB aims to keep inflation at just below 2%, but it was just 1.3% last month.Even on that front, however, the ECB hasn\u2019t done a bad job. Inflation is roughly 2 percentage points higher than when QE was launched in early 2015, and approaching the ECB\u2019s target. Core inflation\u2014excluding volatile food and energy prices\u2014has risen to 1.1%, just off a four-year high. Many economists argue that central banks are bound to be unable to target inflation with a high degree of precision.Crucially, central banks need to move early when the economy is heating up to ensure that inflation doesn\u2019t rise too quickly, because their policies act with a time lag of two or three years. Even if the ECB acts quickly to wind down QE, it is likely to keep adding to its stockpile of bonds until at least the middle of next year.To be sure, policy makers don\u2019t fully understand why inflation hasn\u2019t picked up more. The ECB has repeatedly been forced to cut its inflation forecasts, most recently in June.Economists have suggested a range of reasons for the weakness in global inflation, including poorly understood technological advances, aging populations and globalized supply chains that restrict workers\u2019 ability to press for higher wages.Increasingly, though, major central banks have dismissed the importance of that weakness, and expressed confidence that normal economic relationships would reassert themselves as growth picks up around the world.The global economy is likely to expand by 3.5% this year, up from 3.1% last year, according to the International Monetary Fund. That should spur higher prices for commodities and other products.The U.S. Federal Reserve and the Bank of England both recently signaled that low inflation rates wouldn\u2019t deter them from moving toward higher interest rates.In Portugal last month, Mr. Draghi listed a range of factors holding down eurozone inflation, including external price shocks, a large number of underemployed or discouraged workers, and recent low inflation.\u201cThese effects, however, are on the whole temporary and should not cause inflation to deviate from its trend over the medium term,\u201d Mr. Draghi said.That judgment has found echo elsewhere.\u201cInflation can\u2019t be this way forever,\u201d said       Stefan Gerlach,        deputy governor of Ireland\u2019s central bank until 2015 and now chief economist at EFG Bank in Zurich. \u201cWith economic growth this strong, and global, the balance of evidence suggests this might start feeding into inflation.\u201dFed Chairwoman       Janet Yellen       signaled this week that the U.S. central bank is still anticipating further rate increases despite low inflation, which is also dogging the U.S. economy.Ms. Yellen told Congress on Thursday that a stronger labor market and rising prices of imported goods supported her expectation that a recent downturn in inflation would prove transitory. Still, she said officials were watching inflation data \u201cvery carefully.\u201dThe Fed\u2019s preferred measure of core inflation was just 1.4% in May, and has languished below its 2% target for most of the past five years.", "news_time": "2017-07-14 13:09:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/strong-eurozone-growth-shows-payoff-of-ecb-stimulus-1500052182", "news_title": "Strong Eurozone Growth Shows Payoff of ECB Stimulus ", "keywords": " ecb bond-buying , ecb qe, ecb quantitative easing,ecb stimulus,European Central Bank,monetary policy,central bank intervention,euro zone,currency,economic news"}, {"content": "SINGAPORE\u2014This affluent Asian city-state is known as one of the world\u2019s most orderly places, dominated for decades by a well-educated and accomplished family.Now the clan that made Singapore into a global model of efficiency and control has itself come undone\u2014largely over a century-old bungalow that was the family home.The house, near Singapore\u2019s toniest shopping district, was owned for decades by the city-state\u2019s founding premier, Lee Kuan Yew, who died in 2015.His two youngest children insist Mr. Lee unequivocally wanted it demolished. The eldest\u2014Singapore\u2019s current prime minister\u2014says he as a son wants to honor his father\u2019s wishes, but that Lee Kuan Yew had considered alternatives for the house if the government, acting independently of the premier, decides to preserve it. Their father\u2019s will went through many versions, including two that didn\u2019t call for demolition, though the final one did.The disagreement erupted into a full-fledged public battle in recent weeks, shocking Singaporeans with allegations of abuse of power and secretive revisions to Lee Kuan Yew\u2019s will.One sibling said he will go into exile, after he and his sister posted a statement on Facebook questioning Prime Minister       Lee Hsien Loong\u2019s       \u201ccharacter, conduct, motives and leadership\u201d and suggesting their elder brother wanted to keep the house intact to burnish his political standing.The prime minister blasted the charges as \u201cbaseless,\u201d saying he didn\u2019t abuse power and \u201ctried my best to resolve the issues among us within the family.\u201d He publicly apologized for damage the allegations have caused to Singapore\u2019s reputation, and fielded two days of questioning on the matter in parliament\u2014sessions his younger brother called a \u201cwhitewash.\u201d\u201cIn any other imaginable circumstance than this, I would have sued immediately,\u201d Prime Minister Lee told lawmakers. He and other leaders have previously won defamation cases against opposition politicians and others. But the prime minister said he\u2019s reluctant to take his siblings to court, as it would \u201cbesmirch\u201d his parents\u2019 names and prolong the dispute.A spokeswoman said the prime minister wasn\u2019t available for interviews.Previously undisclosed emails and other correspondence reviewed by The Wall Street Journal show the siblings began fighting in private at least two years ago, eventually communicating only through emails and lawyers, with each accusing the other side of misrepresenting their late father\u2019s wishes.The dispute has prompted many Singaporeans to openly criticize the Lee family on social media and question Singapore\u2019s ruling party, whose success was built in part around the belief that Singapore\u2019s leaders were above reproach.Lee Kuan Yew created a nation built around the notions of \u201cmeritocracy and governance integrity,\u201d said Garry Rodan, a professor at Australia\u2019s Murdoch University who follows Singapore affairs closely. \u201cYet now so many of the claims about meritocratic rule and governance integrity are being challenged from within his family.\u201dA government spokesman dismissed concerns over the feud\u2019s impact, saying Singapore is \u201chighly rated on international assessments of governance.\u201dPrime Minister Lee\u2019s siblings called for a truce in recent days, but threatened to resume public criticism if a settlement isn\u2019t reached. The premier responded by saying he too wants to resolve the dispute privately.That would please many in the political establishment. \u201cStop your family quarrel,\u201d Goh Chok Tong, who served nearly 14 years as prime minister between the two Lees, told parliament this month. \u201cIf that is not immediately possible, at least stop making things worse.\u201dLee Kuan Yew repeatedly said he wanted his house torn down after he died, lest it become a symbol of a personality cult that could retard Singapore\u2019s political development. His two younger children say he referenced the Percy Bysshe Shelley poem, \u201cOzymandias,\u201d about an Egyptian pharaoh whose works crumbled in the desert.Many Singaporeans want to preserve Mr. Lee\u2019s house anyway, like George Washington\u2019s Mount Vernon. In emails between Mr. Lee and his family, reviewed by the Journal, the patriarch acknowledged that Singapore\u2019s government could block his wishes, as it has the power to take over private property in the public interest.Mr. Lee first moved into the home at 38 Oxley Road, built in an area once home to nutmeg plantations and fruit orchards, in 1945.He hosted discussions in the basement dining room that led to the 1954 founding of the People\u2019s Action Party, which has controlled Singapore since it became self-governing in 1959.As prime minister from 1959 to 1990, Mr. Lee combined pro-business policies with zero tolerance for corruption to transform Singapore into one of the world\u2019s richest countries.He also implemented what foreign media described as a paternalistic style of governance, including a ban on the sale of chewing gum, relaxed slightly in 2004. Western critics said his policies stifled political opposition and turned Singapore into a \u201cnanny state.\u201dAt home, he was simply \u201cPapa,\u201d raising a family imbued in his values of thrift, hard work and excellence.Lee Hsien Loong, whose given name means \u201cillustrious dragon,\u201d was born in 1952, followed by sister Lee Wei Ling in 1955 and brother       Lee Hsien Yang       in 1957. Photos and writings of their childhood showed a close-knit family playing chess and spending holidays at Malayan hill stations.Discipline was kept by their mother, sometimes with a cane. The children didn\u2019t have friends over for birthdays and received only books as gifts, Lee Wei Ling recalled in a local newspaper column.Lee Hsien Loong graduated from Cambridge as the top mathematician of his class before returning to Singapore, where he held ministerial portfolios in trade and finance before becoming premier in 2004.\u201cI think he got the best combination of our two DNAs,\u201d Lee Kuan Yew said in an interview published in 2011, referring to Lee Hsien Loong and his parents.Lee Kuan YewKwa Geok Choo(1920\u20132010)(1923\u20132015)Became prime minister in 1959 and oversaw Singapore\u2019s rise from a colonial outpost to one of the world\u2019s wealthiest nations.She practiced law at a firm she cofounded with her husband and brother-in-law.", "news_time": "2017-07-14 12:59:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/first-family-feud-shakes-up-singapore-1500051573", "news_title": "Singapore, a Model of Orderly Rule, Is Jolted by a Bitter Family Feud", "keywords": "38 oxley road,lee kuan yew,singapore politics,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics"}, {"content": "Alexander Klimburg thinks we are not nearly as worried as we should be about internet-borne mayhem in our increasingly interconnected world. His timing couldn\u2019t be better. \u201cThe Internet, a fabulous artifice of human civilization largely perceived today as a domain for advancing freedoms and prosperity,\u201d he writes in the introduction to \u201cThe Darkening Web,\u201d \u201ccould become instead a dark web of subjugation.\u201d He foresees a not too distant future in which cyberspace is primarily \u201ca domain of conflict . . . threatening the overall stability and security not only of the Internet but also of our very societies.\u201dThe cyber attacks in May and June that shut down hospitals in Britain and the United States, ATMs in Ukraine, railways in Germany, and tens of thousands of other targets around the globe were vivid illustrations of a concern that Mr. Klimburg, a cybersecurity researcher and senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, emphasizes throughout: that the United States government, in focusing single-mindedly on developing its own offensive cyber capability, has set off an \u201cinternational arms race in cyber.\u201d The recent attacks in fact used malicious computer code originally developed by the U.S. National Security Agency; the malware fell into the hands of rogue hackers when it was stolen and openly published last year under circumstances that are still unclear.By Alexander KlimburgPenguin Press, 420 pages, $30Like the Stuxnet virus that the NSA, CIA and Israel reportedly employed to sabotage centrifuges in Iran\u2019s nuclear enrichment facility, the weapons used in recent attacks were crafted to penetrate the Windows operating system and exploit security flaws unknown to Microsoft at the time they were developed. Once inside a system, they can be commanded to steal data, monitor communications or engage in more disruptive attacks by disabling key functions.In a world where these kinds of destructive attacks become the norm, Mr. Klimburg argues, it is the U.S. that has the most to lose. Or, as he more sweepingly asserts, the U.S. effort \u201cto achieve total dominance\u201d in offensive cyber capability \u201ccan be safely said to have totally backfired.\u201dMr. Klimburg is particularly dismayed by the two-handed game that the NSA has been playing: outwardly working with technology companies to improve security for all, while secretly withholding knowledge of key weaknesses in the internet and computer software that the agency wants to exploit for its own intelligence or cyber operations. And he warns that the West\u2019s responses to growing cyber threats run the risk of playing right into the \u201cambitions of authoritarian states,\u201d which have long sought to control the flow of information through propaganda and censorship. Another recent front-page story offers a case in point: the discovery that hacking tools sold to the Mexican government by an Israeli security firm\u2014and supposedly restricted to use against terrorists and criminals\u2014had been used by the government instead to harass and spy on domestic critics.Part of the difficulty that Western governments face in responding to these challenges is that a number of very different kinds of threats are lumped together under the catchall terms \u201ccyber attack\u201d or \u201ccyber war.\u201d Broadly speaking, Mr. Klimburg explains, there are at least three types of cyber attacks, each quite distinct.The attacks that most resemble true warfare are those that aim to achieve the results that were once the sole business of bombers or commando teams armed with \u201ckinetic\u201d weapons: taking out an air-defense system or destroying a strategic target such as a power station, dam or command post.A second type of attack is the natural outgrowth of the NSA\u2019s longstanding efforts to penetrate global communications. What in the old days was done by monitoring radio transmissions and codebreaking is today a game of penetrating computers and swiping information at the source\u2014a skill at which the Chinese and Russians have proved as adept as the NSA.And then there is the nebulous but burgeoning field of propaganda and information warfare, alarmingly on display during the 2016 election. An army of Russia-based human and automated attackers (\u201crobo-trolls\u201d) deluged the United States with pro-Trump disinformation, while Russian-government controlled or sponsored groups hacked the Democratic National Committee and other U.S. targets in search of potentially embarrassing or damaging information to influence the outcome.Mr. Klimburg is not the most lucid or engaging guide through the technicalities of the subject. He is overly enamored of poli-sci speak and the jargon of international bureaucracy, devoting pages to discussions of \u201cpath dependency\u201d in the government decision-making process and the nuances of the \u201cmultistakeholder approach.\u201d He offers up the inevitable allusions to Clausewitz and       Tom Friedman,        and never seems to have met an acronym he didn\u2019t like. At crucial moments he retreats into vagueness and platitudes (\u201cthis is not an easy task\u201d).The more disappointing deficiency in \u201cThe Darkening Web\u201d is the failure to engage the inescapable trade-offs that all of these challenges pose. Mr. Klimburg asserts that \u201cto keep the Internet free, we need to keep Internet governance free\u201d and insists that any move toward government regulation falls into a \u201ctrap\u201d that Russia and China will eagerly exploit to clamp down further on their own citizens\u2019 free use of the internet. Yet as the security expert       Bruce Schneier       has argued, only by setting regulatory standards for software security is there now a prayer of keeping up with the threat. Large companies like Apple and Microsoft have done a creditable job deploying quick patches as new threats emerge: Microsoft issued a patch as soon as the NSA hacking tools were published, and the computers affected in recent attacks were ones whose users hadn\u2019t bothered to install the update.But the explosion of the \u201cInternet of Things\u201d\u2014everything from camcorders to cars to thermostats\u2014has led to a deluge of shoddy and vulnerable code from companies too small to afford investing in security updates, or even to care. According to one recent estimate Mr. Klimburg cites, there are already 25 billion devices connected to the internet, more than three for every human being on the planet. This ever-expanding vulnerability, Mr. Schneier has argued, can only be addressed through a regulatory body that deals with security across the entire internet.While insisting that the U.S. ought to devote far more resources to cyber defense and deemphasize what he sees as its no-win pursuit of an offensive dominance that has accelerated the \u201cmilitarization\u201d of cyberspace, Mr. Klimburg acknowledges a fundamental asymmetry at work. The U.S. is especially vulnerable to hackers given its ubiquitous embrace of technology. And the nature of the game virtually ensures that offense will always dominate: it is simply much easier and cheaper to create malicious code than to develop effective counters to it. He quotes       Chris Inglis,        the former NSA deputy director, who wryly observed that if cyber war were soccer, the score would be 462 to 456 after the first 20 minutes. He also quotes two \u201ctruisms\u201d of cyber security: \u201cthat the majority of attacks could be avoided by taking basic defense measures,\u201d notably by updating software immediately, but \u201cthat a dedicated attacker will always get in, no matter what.\u201dIn places, Mr. Klimburg concedes the moral ambiguities of the situation, noting for example that the best hackers make the best security professionals. But he never comes to grips with the fundamental question of whether there is any practical alternative to the U.S. maintaining an overwhelming offensive cyber capability\u2014at least when it comes to deterring state actors from carrying out the most threatening attacks, those aiming to wreak physical havoc on factories, pipelines, electric grids and other vital infrastructure. If \u201ca dedicated attacker will always get in,\u201d the situation is very analogous to nuclear warfare: Only the threat of massive retaliation can deter an attack in the first place. Of course, that assumes that one knows who the attacker is, and the author is skeptical of recent NSA hints that it has solved the problem of \u201cattribution,\u201d tracing an attack to its source.Those charged with walking this tightrope of competing goals more astutely recognize that everything is a matter of degree.       Michael Hayden,        the former NSA director, has suggested that American policy must balance defense and offense on a case-by-case basis and has hinted that the NSA is keeping to itself knowledge of only the small number of software vulnerabilities that it is confident are beyond the means of anyone but the United States government to exploit. In that, the situation is no different from the challenge that NSA cryptologists faced throughout the Cold War, when they struggled to fine-tune the balance between codemaking and codebreaking in the hope that America\u2019s allies would be equipped with codes secure enough to keep everyone in the world from cracking them\u2014except for the NSA.Mr. Klimburg effectively outlines the dangers we face but, when it comes to solutions, offers little more than abstractions about international governance mechanisms. And he does not even mention what Mr. Schneier posits as, ultimately, the only real way out: If we truly wish to keep our devices safe from attackers out to take over what is becoming a single world-wide robot, we need to start unplugging things from the far-too-ubiquitous web.\u2014Mr. Budiansky\u2019s latest book is \u201cCode Warriors: NSA\u2019s Codebreakers and the Secret Intelligence War Against the Soviet Union.\u201d", "news_time": "2017-07-14 12:59:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-coming-war-for-cyberspace-1500051589", "news_title": "The Coming War for Cyberspace", "keywords": "bookcar0715,book review,books,political,general news,crime,legal action,arts,entertainment,reviews"}, {"content": "The simple, clean style of modernist architecture has proved to have staying power.

A potential sale could give investors a slice of some 30 Asian businesses that Warburg Pincus Private Equity XI LP, has backed over the years, one of the people said.Fund XI wrapped up with $11.2 billion in 2013 and at that time was one of the largest funds raised after the 2008 financial crisis. It made venture-capital, growth-equity and private-equity bets in the U.S. and throughout the globe. The portfolio includes Chinese companies such as Beijing Amcare Women\u2019s & Children\u2019s Hospital and trucking company Shanghai ANE Logistics Co.Asia now makes up about half of the fund\u2019s value, said a person familiar with the matter. Fund XI has a roughly $5 billion portfolio of stakes in China, India and other Asia businesses that it has not yet exited.The firm is working with investment bank             Lazard                   to shop a pool of as much as one-fifth of the $5 billion Asian portfolio, in hopes of speeding up the flow of cash to fund investors, four people said.As part of a potential deal, the roughly 20% strip of Asian assets would be shifted into a new fund that secondary firms could invest in, one of the people said. Warburg plans to manage that new pool alongside Fund XI. As with any deal, the firm won\u2019t proceed with the sale, if it can\u2019t get its desired price, two people said.If it closes, the deal would demonstrate how investors can get access to Asian deals without the uncertainty of pledging money to brand new funds.Warburg\u2019s plan tests the waters just as secondhand trades in private-equity stakes in Asia are expected to take off. Buyers of secondhand stakes, impatient to do deals after raising massive funds, are stepping away from their strongholds in the U.S. and Europe and wading into Asia and other new markets.More than 60% of such secondary buyers in a recent survey conducted by WSJ Pro Private Equity said they expect more deal flow this year from Asia, excluding Japan, an increase from 38% of buyers who predicted an increase in a similar survey for the year-earlier period.If the deal goes through, it also would demonstrate how secondary sales are being used by established private-equity managers to accelerate the flow of cash back to investors. Warburg\u2019s 11th fund had returned 1.3 times invested capital as of the end of 2016, according to an investor document.Meanwhile Warburg, which has backed companies such as Chinese bike-sharing giant Beijing Mobike Technology Co. and Indonesia\u2019s motorcycle hailing startup Go-Jek, continues to invest in Asia.

The city is set to levy fines on food sellers that don\u2019t comply beginning Aug. 21.\u201cWe are confident that our updated calorie labeling rules announced this past May will withstand scrutiny,\u201d said a spokesman for the New York City Department of Health & Mental Hygiene. \u201cIt\u2019s just good, common-sense policy that benefits all New Yorkers.\u201dThe Food and Drug Administration had planned to begin enforcing a similar requirement nationally in August but delayed it for a year to consider a more flexible mandate. New York decided to move ahead with its own tougher rule, angering some restaurants that feared other cities might follow suit. That would require them to create different signage for individual cities and states, some chains said.\u201cThat creates a lot of cost and complexity for our business,\u201d said       Sara Burnett,        director of wellness and food policy at         Panera Bread Co.      , which has posted calorie information on menus since 2010.New York City has required chain restaurants to display calorie counts on their menus since 2008.Other cities have enacted similar laws, leading restaurants to push for a national standard.In their injunction, the trade groups said they believe New York City is pre-empting federal law by imposing its own regulation before enforcement of the federal one begins.Ms. Burnett said Panera is frustrated the FDA has delayed enforcement of a nationwide standard. But other chains including             Domino\u2019s Pizza Inc.       lobbied for the delay. Domino\u2019s and other pizza companies support a separate bill that would allow businesses whose food is mostly consumed off-site to post their nutritional information online.\u201cThe original rule didn\u2019t accommodate our business model of remote ordering,\u201d Domino\u2019s spokesman       Tim McIntyre       said. He said Domino\u2019s has listed nutrition information on its website for 14 years and doesn\u2019t want the federal rule repealed.Mr. McIntyre said aspects of the federal rule are unfair, though, including criminal liability and a fine of up to $100,000 per incident for menu items found to contain more calories than listed. He said pizza makers hope the alternate bill they are promoting would act as an addendum to the calorie count regulation.The bill has gained the support of the supermarkets and convenience stores that are increasingly selling more prepared meals that people eat off-site.Write to Julie Jargon at julie.jargon@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-14 12:09:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/food-retailers-file-injunction-to-stop-new-york-menu-rules-1500044724", "news_title": "Food Retailers File Injunction to Stop New York Menu Rules", "keywords": "calorie counts,consumer rights,menu requirements, menu rules, menus,new york city restaurants, new york menus,nutritional information,National Restaurant Association,political,general news,food,drink,health,living,lifestyle,nutrition"}, {"content": "NPD BookScan gathers point-of-sale book data from more than 16,000 locations across the U.S., representing about 85% of the nation\u2019s book sales.

My dream is to see more women playing roles so minor that their characters don\u2019t even merit a proper name.The vast majority of actors today are vying not to play Wonder Woman but to get cast for one-day-stint roles like Chihuahua Owner, Underdeveloped Clone and Mayor\u2019s Sycophantic Assistant. In my 30 years in the business, I\u2019ve played many parts, but I\u2019ll always remember my moment as Woman in Bathroom in the 1997 romantic comedy \u201c\u2019Til There Was You\u201d: I was a stranger who offered       Sarah Jessica Parker       unsolicited dating advice in a restaurant restroom, and the gig put me over the minimum earnings needed to qualify for the actors\u2019 union health-insurance plan.Supporting players don\u2019t have entourages, on-call masseuses or personal assistants. The freelance working actor cobbles together an annual income that is usually in the range of the median for Los Angeles. Sometimes the bit parts are steppingstones to larger roles; sometimes they are relationship-builders with directors or producers; sometimes they are the career. But here\u2019s the thing about those working actors: They\u2019re mostly men.A 2016 study by the USC Annenberg School found that female characters comprised only some 29% of all speaking roles in films. (We fared better in television and best in streaming media, where female roles made up 38% of speaking roles.) Some of these parts pass in a blink. In \u201cZero Dark Thirty,\u201d after the Navy SEALs kill Osama bin Laden, an actor identified in the screenplay only as Commanding Officer barks, \u201cAll stations: target secure, target secure.\u201d Most people in the theater didn\u2019t notice Commanding Officer\u2014but I did, because that\u2019s a gig I would have liked to have had a shot at.The minor parts I most covet, the ones I hope will support me in my rapidly approaching dotage, are what I call \u201cforgettable exposition roles.\u201d These are the ubiquitous craggy faced gentlemen who play scowling cabinet members or stodgy generals and declare, \u201cMr. President, there\u2019s an emergency in sector seven.\u201d Those parts usually go to men\u2014not least because directors are most often male.Put a woman behind the camera, and you\u2019ll see 5.4% more girls and women on the screen, says the USC study. \u201cWonder Woman,\u201d the first superhero blockbuster with a female director, has 72 credited roles listed on IMDB.com, and 41 of them went to women. Of course, the film is set amid World War I, which means that Ms. Jenkins needed to cast a lot of male soldiers.But \u201cTransformers: The Last Knight,\u201d with a male director, has no such justification. Out of its 84 credited roles on IMDb, a whopping 19 went to females. Men played plenty of parts that, according to their IMDb descriptions, were hardly gender-specific: Government Suit, U.K. Prime Minister and four roles for Jet Propulsion Laboratory scientists.That none of the JPL engineers were women didn\u2019t go unnoticed by female scientists.       Carolyn Porco,        the imaging science team leader for the Cassini space mission, told me, \u201cI\u2019ve been working with JPL for decades now, and I can tell you: These days, there are female engineers all over the place.\u201d In \u201cThe Martian,\u201d       Matt Damon\u2019s       character survives, in part, by modifying equipment from the Mars Pathfinder Lander designed by JPL. The movie\u2019s cast includes four bit parts for JPL Pathfinder Team members. All of them were men, even though the real-life Pathfinder team included several female engineers.I hope that we can do better, and soon. For one thing, those day-player roles can make a career. Early on,       Brad Pitt       was cast as Waiter, Boy at Beach and Preppy Kid at Fight. For another, I\u2019m not getting any younger, and judges\u2019 robes are so wonderfully forgiving.

Some swipe their lucky numbers, others their\u00a0birthday or anniversary digits. Athletes go for their jersey numerals. Die-hards want a complete set of\u00a01 through 96.Misappropriating\u00a0an orange-and-white-striped Whataburger\u00a0order number has become a rite of passage\u00a0of sorts in the Lone Star State, where some posit you can\u2019t be truly Texan unless you\u2019ve filched a tent or two\u2026or 10.\u201cI have 8, 80, 88, 89, and I think I have 87,\u201d says 18-year-old Katlynn Kincy of Cypress, Texas, who says she sometimes sits on a table tent to hide it until she can pocket it. She keeps her carryout contraband lined up in a closet and wants to collect all with her favorite number, 8. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely a big Texas thing.\u201dWhataburger\u00a0says its 815 restaurants in 10 states from Arizona to Florida go through\u00a0roughly 1.2 million tents a year, although it doesn\u2019t track how many people carry off. Some locations, particularly near high schools and colleges, lose numbers so fast they\u00a0have to order new ones every month, the company says.In Denton County, Texas, police took notice several months ago after spotting piles of the little tents in cars during traffic stops.       James Edland,        chief of the area\u2019s Northeast Police Department, says officers made the drivers\u2014mostly teens and young adults\u2014return the tents to a local Whataburger in Cross Roads, Texas, 40 miles north of Dallas.\u201cIt\u2019s just a little piece of plastic, but it\u2019s not yours,\u201d Mr. Edland\u00a0says. \u201cDon\u2019t take it.\u201dWhataburger wasn\u2019t involved in the police crackdown but doesn\u2019t encourage the stealing of table tents, says       Rich Scheffler,        Whataburger\u2019s vice president of Marketing and Innovation.The restaurants don\u2019t do much to stop the numbers from walking off, though. \u201cIf those things are disappearing and making their way onto somebody\u2019s shelf or dashboard or wherever it may be, that is advertising that Whataburger would love to pay for,\u201d Mr. Scheffler says. \u201cWe would never want to stop that.\u201dStill, customers delight in the furtive act of filching. Most say they slip the table tents into a pocket or purse, hoping no one notices. The numbers are printed on customers\u2019 receipts, so servers can call out a number if they don\u2019t see it\u2014a loophole some collectors exploit by pretending they never got one.Others say they boldly stare a cashier in the eye as they lift numbers.If a Whataburger employee doesn\u2019t ask for the table tent when delivering an order, it\u2019s as good as gone, says       Marlena Jordan,        a 21-year-old from Denton, Texas, who says she has roughly 80 Whataburger tents at home, some of them gifts from friends.\u201cMost of the time, they just leave\u00a0them on the table, and that\u2019s our sign,\u201d\u00a0says\u00a0Ms. Jordan,\u00a0who started boosting tents in college to see how many she could amass.It wasn\u2019t until 2004, when\u00a0Whataburger\u00a0redesigned its tents to mimic its restaurants\u2019 bright-orange-and-white-striped roofs, that fans started to slip off with them routinely, Mr. Scheffler says. Before that, the chain used blue tents with white numbers and a little W.The chain was surprised that people would find the new numbers so irresistible, he says, but has come to appreciate their passion for the tents, which cost the company about 25 cents each.The tents sometimes end up for sale on             eBay.       A No. 69 is currently listed at the asking price of $2,000.\u00a0Its seller,       Ramy Rabi,        18, says his cache of tents started with his soccer jersey numbers: 26, 17, 7, 9 and 19.Mr. Rabi says he listed the tent several months ago just to see how much a Whataburger fan might pay. He\u2019s gotten several inquiries. The highest offer has been $69.Spotting\u00a0Whataburger\u00a0numbers in the wild is a bit of a tradition itself.\u00a0A television news crew in Houston in March reported catching the table tents\u2014whose orange hue is akin to a traffic cone\u2019s\u2014being used to mark evidence at a murder scene.\u201cIn a pinch, they utilize whatever they can get their hands on,\u201d Houston police spokesman Victor Senties says, noting that using Whataburger tents as evidence flags isn\u2019t best practice because of the contamination risk.The tents disappear so quickly that some Whataburger restaurants are left temporarily numberless and others appear to have taken the most popular numbers out of rotation, some customers report. Whataburger says it can\u2019t confirm those reports.The burger chain started to capitalize on their popularity three years ago, issuing a commemorative table tent for graduating classes. The 2017 version is for sale on Whataburger\u2019s website for $6.99.Mr. Scheffler\u2019s team also fields\u2014and fulfills\u2014numerous polite requests for the standard tents. A few days ago, a man inquired wanting a No. 74 tent to display on the dash of a 1974             Volkswagen                   Karmann Ghia he had painted orange.\u00a0Whataburger says it is shipping him that tent.Die-hard fan       Blake Miller,        23, showed up at a tattoo parlor in San Antonio last year to get a Whataburger-themed tat on his arm. He settled on putting his area code\u2014361 for Corpus Christi, Texas, where Whataburger originated\u2014on the face of a table tent after the tattoo artist pulled him aside to show off a pair of stolen order numbers.\u201cWhataburger\u00a0is just like a hometown tradition,\u201d he says of the meaning behind his tattoo. \u201cIt\u2019s just where we go, like a second home.\u201dMr. Miller says he and his friends have nicked dozens of Whataburger table tents over the years. \u201cI mean, who doesn\u2019t?\u201dWrite to Erin Ailworth at Erin.Ailworth@wsj.comAppeared in the July 15, 2017, print edition as 'When Whataburger Asks Texans To Take a Number, They Oblige.'", "news_time": "2017-07-14 11:35:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/at-whataburger-take-a-number-means-something-entirely-different-1500046507", "news_title": "At Whataburger, \u2018Take a Number\u2019 Means Something Entirely Different ", "keywords": " carryout, number tent, order number, order tent, table tent, takeout,whataburger,political,general news,crime,legal action,food,drink,living,lifestyle,burglary,theft,page-one stories,restaurants,cafes,fast food places"}, {"content": "J.P. Morgan Chase               & Co. posted a record profit for the second quarter as a lending boost in both its consumer and commercial businesses offset weaker trading results.But the bank trimmed its full-year outlook for growth in lending and net interest income. That caused J.P. Morgan\u2019s shares to fall, despite it posting net income of $7.03 billion, up 13% from a year earlier.At the same time, Chief Executive       James Dimon      expressed continued frustration with a failure in the U.S. to enact policy changes in regard to regulation, taxation, infrastructure spending and education, among others.That, he said, was holding back the U.S. economy. \u201cIt\u2019s hurting the average American that we don\u2019t have these right policies,\u201d Mr. Dimon said on a call with analysts. \u201cWe have become one of the most bureaucratic, confusing, litigious societies on the planet. It\u2019s almost an embarrassment to be an American citizen traveling around the world and listening to the stupid shit we have to deal with in this country.\u201cWe have to get our act together,\u201d he added.Despite this, J.P. Morgan continued to grow revenue, which was rose 4.7% from a year ago to $26.41 billion. That topped analyst expectations of $24.96 billion.Return on equity, a measure of profitability, was 12% in the second quarter compared with 10% a year earlier.Earnings per share were $1.82. Those were boosted by a legal benefit of $406 million after taxes related to a settlement involving         Washington Mutual,       which the bank bought during the financial crisis. That helped boost earnings per share by 11 cents. Absent that, the bank would have posted $1.71 a share in earnings. That, though, was still above expectations for $1.58, according to analysts polled by Thomson Reuters.Total loans grew 4.1% from a year earlier to about $908.77 billion. Net interest income rose 7.6% to $12.21 billion.Finance chief       Marianne Lake       trimmed forecasts for growth in both these areas, however. She said that loan growth, previously forecast at 10%, was likely to come in at 8% for the year as a whole. Net interest income is now expected to grow by $4 billion, Ms. Lake said, down from earlier guidance of $4.5 billion.One area of weakness in the bank\u2019s results came from trading, which was hampered by a lack of volatility and customer activity. Trading revenue decreased by 14% to $4.8 billion.The performance was dragged down by 19% decline in fixed-income trading compared with the prior-year period.The results, though, were largely in line with Ms. Lake\u2019s comments at an investor conference in May that trading at that point was down by about 15% from a year ago. She said Friday that it is too early to comment on July trading.While trading was weak, investment-banking activity helped bolster overall results for J.P. Morgan\u2019s corporate and investment banking business. Profit at this unit increased 8.7% from a year ago to $2.71 billion. Advisory revenue rose 7.9%, while equity underwriting revenue jumped 29%.Among J.P. Morgan\u2019s other businesses, the commercial bank earned $902 million, a 30% increase from the year-earlier quarter. The bank\u2019s asset-management unit reported a profit of $624 million, up 20%. Both were record profits for those businesses.Conditions in the consumer bank were more challenging. Profits fell to $2.22 billion in the quarter, down from $2.66 billion a year ago.J.P. Morgan extended $23.9 billion in mortgages in the quarter, a decrease of 4.4% from the $25 billion the bank extended a year earlier. Revenue in the bank\u2019s mortgage division, one of the largest in the U.S. by volume, was $1.43 billion, down 26% from a year ago.Ms. Lake said the mortgage market is smaller and more competitive, and \u201cfewer loans have met our hurdle rate.\u201dOverall, J.P. Morgan set aside $1.22 billion in the second quarter to cover loans that could potentially turn bad in the future. That compares with $1.4 billion in the second quarter of 2016 and $1.32 billion in the first quarter of 2017.The bank lost $1.2 billion to loan defaults, or 0.56% of its overall portfolio, compared with a 0.79% charge-off rate in the first quarter of 2017.The bank\u2019s provision for credit losses fell to $1.22 billion from $1.4 billion a year earlier.Write to Emily Glazer at emily.glazer@wsj.comAppeared in the July 15, 2017, print edition as 'J.P.

They were relatives, and ranged in age from 19 to 29.The two slain police officers weren\u2019t immediately identified, but police said they were members of Israel\u2019s minority Druse community.After the attack, in which one person was also wounded, Israeli police canceled Friday prayers at the mosque, a rare move that drew protests from some Palestinians. Authorities also banned all Palestinians living in the West Bank and holding permits to enter Jerusalem from entering Israel.Palestinian media outlets and Fatah, the political party led by Palestinian Authority President       Mahmoud Abbas,        urged Muslims in Jerusalem to try to pray at the mosque despite the closure.Following assessments from his top security officials, Israeli Prime Minister       Benjamin Netanyahu       ordered beefed up security at the entrances of Temple Mount, his office said. Also, a decision on reopening the site for prayer and visitors won\u2019t occur until a security assessment on Sunday.After Friday\u2019s attack, Israeli security forces entered Temple Mount and checked the area for any further threats, a break with the Israel\u2019s longstanding practice of refraining from operating there to avoid friction. The inspection was necessary to prevent more violence, a senior Israeli official said.Temple Mount, known to Muslims as the Noble Sanctuary, has often been the focus of violence between Palestinians and Israeli security forces.In 2000,       Ariel Sharon,        then head of the Likud party and later Israel\u2019s prime minister, entered the plaza with his supporters, sparking violence that expanded into the second Palestinian uprising, or intifada.A new wave of Temple Mount-related violence broke out in September 2015, amid Palestinian fears that Israel was encroaching on the plaza and was seeking to change the longtime status quo over access to it. The bloodshed left hundreds dead, many of them Palestinian attackers.Temple Mount, in Jerusalem\u2019s Old City, was the location of an ancient Jewish temple. It is bordered on one side by the Western Wall, considered the holiest site in Judaism. Al Aqsa mosque, which sits on the esplanade, is the third holiest site in Islam, after Mecca and Medina in Saudi Arabia.With Israel\u2019s support, Temple Mount is administered by the Waqf, a Muslim religious authority in Jordan. While only Muslims are currently allowed to pray on the Temple Mount, Jews are permitted to visit the area.Since Israel won control of Temple Mount in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, the Israeli government has banned Jews from praying there to prevent violence. The Jewish religious establishment has told Jews to avoid entering the site for fear of desecrating the site where the temple once stood.Jewish extremists have been replaced by activists who say prayer there is a civil-rights issue. Some rabbis have reconsidered the bans. Some right-wing lawmakers see it as a political issue and have promoted legislation to declare Israeli sovereignty on the Temple Mount.Hamas, the Palestinian political and militant group that rules the Gaza Strip, called Friday\u2019s attack \u201ca normal answer to the terror of the [Israeli] occupation and their discrimination at Al Aqsa.\u201d\u2014       Abubakr Bashir       in Gaza City,       Nuha Musleh       in Ramallah and       Margaret Coker       in Istanbul contributed to this article.Appeared in the July 15, 2017, print edition as 'Two Israeli Police Killed in Attack.'", "news_time": "2017-07-14 11:31:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/three-terrorists-shot-dead-in-jerusalem-temple-mount-attack-1500014104", "news_title": "Israeli Police Officers Shot Dead in Jerusalem Temple Mount Attack ", "keywords": "jerusalem, old city, temple mount,political,general news,national,public security,crime,legal action,law enforcement,murder,manslaughter,risk news,military action"}, {"content": "Prominent technology-industry leaders and venture capitalists gathered in the White House\u2019s state dining room last month to discuss tech policy with President       Donald Trump       in an event that Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser, helped organize.Seated at the rectangular table alongside the corporate luminaries, university presidents and senior White House officials was a less-prominent figure:       Zachary Bookman,        the\u00a037-year-old\u00a0CEO of a small startup called OpenGov.Mr. Kushner\u2019s brother, through a venture-capital firm, is a part owner of OpenGov, according to government disclosures and data from Dow Jones VentureSource. Until earlier this year, Mr. Kushner owned stakes in the venture-capital firm that he sold to his brother, according to a person familiar with the matter.\u00a0Mr. Kushner\u2019s connection to OpenGov isn\u2019t widely known.Many senior Trump administration officials hail from the business world, triggering concerns about potential conflicts between their private interests and public duties. The OpenGov situation\u2014in which a top White House official helped organize a prestigious event where one of the participants was financially connected to his family\u2014is an example of how such potential conflicts can play out.Scoring a seat at the summit was a milestone for OpenGov, a Redwood City, Calif. company that aims to make government data more user-friendly and has sought business with the federal government, according to its website. OpenGov\u2019s clients are mostly state and local governments\u2014such as Converse County, Wyo. and California Polytechnic State University\u2014looking to upgrade their technology.Mr. Kushner\u2019s connection to OpenGov is through Thrive Capital, a venture-capital firm run by his brother Joshua Kushner. Thrive is one of four investors that OpenGov lists on its website.A spokesman for Jared Kushner declined to comment.OpenGov\u2019s Mr. Bookman was the only chief executive of a small firm among the 18 tech leaders to get a seat at the table with the president.\u00a0At least one other startup CEO had a second-row seat. OpenGov\u2019s valuation was estimated at $180 million after an October 2015 funding round, according to Dow Jones VentureSource, while the average market capitalization of the 14 publicly traded companies represented at the table\u2014including             Amazon.com Inc.,Apple Inc.,Microsoft Corp.       and             Alphabet Inc.      \u2014is about $250 billion, according to FactSet.At the event, a video of which was made public, Mr. Trump thanked his son-in-law for assembling \u201csuch a spectacular group of people.\u201d Mr. Bookman also praised Mr. Kushner for his work on tech issues. Mr. Trump said the meeting was focused on ways to use technology to make government more efficient.A spokesman for Thrive said the company \u201cdid not play any role in OpenGov\u2019s invitation, and was not aware of its participation in the meeting until after the fact.\u201dMr. Kushner didn\u2019t suggest the invitation to OpenGov, according to       Matt Lira,        who works in his innovation office. \u201cIt was my idea to invite OpenGov to our technology leadership listening session,\u201d Mr. Lira said in a statement. He added that he knew OpenGov from working with them in previous congressional roles.Mr. Bookman said he thinks his company was invited because it is \u201crecognized as an industry leader for our work at the state and local level.\u201d He said the company is mainly focused on winning business from state and local governments, not Washington.Kathleen Clark, a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis, said the OpenGov situation raised ethics issues. \u201cThis seems like a textbook example of cronyism in action,\u201d she said.\u201cWe always advised staff when arranging summits like this to avoid even the appearance of impropriety or preferential treatment,\u201d said       Daniel Jacobson,        who was counsel to the White House\u2019s information-technology and digital strategy offices in the Obama administration. He said he probably would have advised staff \u201cnot to extend the invite or at least to invite other similarly situated companies.\u201dThe White House declined to comment.\u201cIt\u2019s particularly interesting and remarkable, in that OpenGov does not have any federal customers and this is a federal initiative,\u201d said       Kevin Merritt,        founder of Socrata, a Seattle-based rival to OpenGov that works with the federal government and wasn\u2019t invited to the event.Thrive Capital invested in OpenGov in several fundraising rounds dating back to 2013. Jared Kushner was on Thrive\u2019s board at the time, and left in January. OpenGov represents a small part of Thrive\u2019s total investment portfolio, according a person familiar with the matter.\u00a0The Thrive spokesman declined to say what the value of the investment was.Mr. Kushner\u2019s government financial-disclosure form shows he had stakes in Thrive. It didn\u2019t identify OpenGov or other holdings.Ethics rules don\u2019t necessarily require such holdings to be disclosed, but some other senior administration officials, such as Secretary of Education       Betsy DeVos,        have listed companies held by venture funds they own.Mr. Kushner recently filed an amended disclosure form, which is expected to be released publicly soon, according to people close to him. It will disclose assets that Mr. Kushner didn\u2019t report in his original filing in March, including\u00a0up to $250,000 of Israeli government\u00a0bonds he sold earlier this year and an art collection he jointly owns with his wife,       Ivanka Trump,       \u00a0the people said.The revised form also will show Mr. Kushner\u2019s interest in\u00a0a real-estate startup called Cadre, they said. The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this year that Mr. Kushner is retaining a stake in\u00a0Cadre and that he hadn\u2019t identified his stake in\u00a0the company in his initial financial disclosure.Write to Jean Eaglesham at jean.eaglesham@wsj.com and Lisa Schwartz at Lisa.Schwartz@wsj.comAppeared in the July 15, 2017, print edition as 'Trump Tech Invitee Tied to Kushners.'", "news_time": "2017-07-14 11:23:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/startup-that-got-a-seat-at-white-house-roundtable-is-part-owned-by-kushner-family-1500045800", "news_title": "Startup That Got a Seat at White House Roundtable Is Part-Owned by Kushner Family ", "keywords": "conflict of interest,ethics,kushner,opengov,roundtable,thrive,vc industry news,venture capital,white house,OpenGov,Donald Trump,Zachary Bookman,management,corporate,industrial news,senior level management,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,computers,consumer electronics,retail,wholesale,etailing,e-commerce,online service providers,technology"}, {"content": "The most closely watched player in the National Football League this offseason isn\u2019t       Tom Brady,        coming off an improbable Super Bowl comeback. Or Matt Ryan, the reigning MVP whose Falcons let that title slip away. It\u2019s not even Raiders quarterback Derek Carr, who inked a record-setting extension in June.\u201cThat one guy is Kirk Cousins,\u201d says       Ross Tucker,        a former NFL offensive lineman and host of an eponymous podcast.This is of course rather peculiar given the Washington Redskins quarterback has started just two full seasons and won fewer than half of his career starts.The issue is his contract dispute, which could upend the economics of the entire league. It\u2019s even possible that if the two sides don\u2019t reach a resolution by Monday, next year Cousins\u2014who is not one of the best quarterbacks in the league by most standards\u2014could hit the open market as the most valuable free agent the NFL has ever seen.All of this has become thinkable because for the second straight season Washington gave Cousins its franchise tag, which is a one-year contract that prevents a player from hitting free agency but automatically makes him one of the highest-paid players at his given position in the league. Cousins and the Redskins have until next week to either agree to an extension\u2014which they failed to do in the same situation last year\u2014or he will play out the season on the franchise tag.Few players are willing to take the risk Cousins has absorbed. Franchise tags are lucrative but only one-year long. That is daunting in a sport where an injury can torpedo a player\u2019s value on any given snap.That\u2019s why players who receive a franchise tag often agree to an extension before hitting the open market and infrequently play on that one-year guarantee for multiple seasons. And because the tag prevents players from hitting free agency, any extension comes before the opportunity of learning their true value on the open market.That\u2019s where Cousins comes in. He played on the tag last year, trusting he could up his long-term value with a second straight season of solid play. He did exactly that. He completed 67% of his passes and threw 25 touchdowns in 2016, a year after taking Washington from last place to NFC East champions. In the process, he made $20 million.With each consecutive year a team tags a player, the cost escalates\u2014Cousins would be the first quarterback in league history to play on the tag in back-to-back seasons. This year, the deal will pay him $24 million, making him one of the highest paid players in the league, after which he could become one of the best quarterbacks in recent history to hit the open market. Next season, the expected cost for Washington to franchise him a third and final time: $34 million, a figure so exorbitant that it could be prohibitive under the salary cap.By comparison, Carr\u2019s recent extension worth $125 million in total reportedly only includes $40 million fully guaranteed. Cousins, already guaranteed $24 million this season and with a tasty payday potentially looming a year from now, has the leverage to blow that guaranteed figure out of the water.Washington then faces a perverse reality: The better he plays, the more astronomical the cost to resign him. Which means if their quarterback has another strong season, \u201cthe club is going to suffer,\u201d says former NFL general manager Floyd Reese.For prized players, who frequently opt for the security of long-term deals before the chance to test free agency, Cousins could become Exhibit A for how being patient can be hugely lucrative\u2014if you can stomach the obvious injury risks.\u201cHe has the Redskins over a barrel,\u201d said J.I. Halsell, a former salary cap analyst with the Redskins and former agent. \u201cThis Kirk Cousins example will set the precedent for what you could do as a player, or maybe what you should not do from a club perspective.\u201dCorrections & Amplifications   Ross Tucker is a former NFL offensive lineman.

The answer may seem simple at first: a person who looks Chinese.But imagine a young woman born and brought up in the U.S. Her grandmother is from China, and she happens to have inherited many of her grandmother\u2019s physical traits. She doesn\u2019t speak Chinese or identify in any way with Chinese culture, and she thinks of herself as a proud American. When she is called Chinese, she forcefully rejects the label.Or consider my own case. Canadian by birth, with Caucasian physical features, I have lived and worked in China for more than two decades, speak the Chinese language, identify with Chinese culture and am now a permanent resident of China. But almost no one considers me Chinese.Both of these instances point to the difficulty with a view that is deeply ingrained in contemporary China and at least implicitly endorsed elsewhere: That to be Chinese is to belong to a race.I feel welcomed and loved in China. My wife is Chinese, and I\u2019ve done my best to integrate since arriving in 2004. But I can\u2019t fully succeed. My Chinese friends sometimes call me a \u201cChinese son-in-law.\u201d It\u2019s meant as a compliment, but the implication in Chinese is that I\u2019m not fully Chinese.The obstacles are not legal. It is possible to gain citizenship by marrying a Chinese person, but in practice few do. According to the 2010 census, the country\u2019s population of 1.39 billion citizens includes just 1,448 naturalized Chinese. China does not allow dual citizenship, which makes the decision more difficult, but in principle, race is not a barrier to becoming a Chinese citizen.Nor is language the main obstacle to popular acceptance. My Chinese is far from perfect, but I can give academic talks in Chinese, and I can surprise taxi drivers when I call for a ride and they arrive expecting to see a Chinese customer. Millions of poorly educated Chinese citizens speak hardly any Mandarin, and yet nobody questions their Chineseness.It certainly isn\u2019t any lack of commitment on my part to Chinese culture. I\u2019ve been working on Confucian philosophy for many years, and it inspires the way I lead my life. I\u2019m told over and over that my commitment to Chinese culture is more \u201cChinese\u201d than that of many Chinese people. At conferences in China, I often find myself the only person wearing Chinese-style clothing.The real obstacle to popular acceptance is the assumption that Chineseness is a racial category. Stereotypes against outsiders are common in any culture, and China is no exception. Pejorative statements about non-Han Chinese can be found in ancient texts, and there have been tragic outbursts of racism in Chinese history. The Jie people, who were probably of Central Asian stock, established the Later Zhao dynasty but were massacred shortly thereafter, around A.D. 350. The killings were said to be based on their Caucasian looks, and many bearded people were killed just because they were too Jie-looking.But there is a more inspiring current in Chinese history as well. As the historian Yuri Pines of the Hebrew University in Jerusalem has noted, the dominant elite culture in ancient China emphasized cultural belonging, not race or ethnicity, as the most important trait for citizenship. Chinese people were those who adhered to the common ritual norms of the Zhou dynasty (1046-256 B.C.). One could learn to be Chinese.During much of its history, particularly the eras of prosperity and glory, China was an open society that welcomed foreigners. The Tang dynasty (A.D. 618-907) is a classic example. The capital Chang\u2019an was a multicultural urban center with nearly a million residents and drew ambitious migrants from around the world. Its greatest generals were Turks, Koreans and Sogdians (an ancient Iranian civilization). Arab scholars could participate in the imperial examinations. Li Bai, its most famous poet, was perhaps of Central Asian stock.But the open attitude of the Tang dynasty eventually gave way. After the shocking rebellion of An Lushan in the 8th century and the sacking of the capital by Uighurs and Tibetans, Chinese attitudes toward outsiders took a markedly negative turn.This is a recurrent pattern. When China is powerful and secure, foreigners are welcome and considered employable, including at the highest levels of government. When China is weak, foreigners are often viewed with suspicion and even hatred. The most famous modern case is the Boxer Rebellion of 1899-1901, which sought to violently expel the Western and Christian presence in China.Indeed, China\u2019s most insecure period was the \u201ccentury of humiliation\u201d from the 1840s to the 1940s. Chinese elites came to realize that not only was China not the center of the world, it was a weak country unable to stand up for itself. China lost wars to Western countries and Japan, and its territory was carved up by foreign powers.It was in the wake of these events that a race-based conception of Chinese identity took hold. Leading reformers of the day, such as the scholar and political thinker Kang Youwei, traveled the world and came to the pessimistic conclusion that different races were engaged in a deadly struggle for survival. They saw Chinese identity as the legitimate racial basis for a nation-state that could take its place against other similarly constituted nations.That legacy still shapes attitudes today. But China has rebuilt a strong and powerful state, with less to fear from foreign bullying, and it has become a key player in our vast, cosmopolitan world economy. To my mind, China has reached a point in its history when it can return to a more generous conception of identity and embrace those who meet the cultural criteria of Chineseness.There are also pragmatic grounds for such a shift.       Yan Xuetong,        a leading theorist of international relations at Tsinghua University, argues that China should employ more foreigners as public officials and put them on the road to citizenship. Once China passes a necessary threshold of hard power, he says, China should compete for human talent rather than for economic or military superiority.A meritocratic immigration policy open to all, regardless of ethnic or racial background, would also serve China\u2019s economic interests. The now-discarded one-child policy has created a demographic bulge, with the elderly constituting an ever-growing proportion of the population. The country would greatly benefit from the contributions of talented young migrants from around the world.President       Xi Jinping       describes his broad agenda for the country as the \u201cChina dream.\u201d My own China dream is more modest: to be viewed as a Chinese not just in my own mind but in the minds of my fellow Chinese.\u2014 Dr. Bell is dean of the school of political science and public administration at Shandong University and a professor at Tsinghua University.

Morgan\u2019s strong loan growth has stood out in recent quarters, even as lending has slowed nationwide. But in the second quarter its total loans were up just 4% from a year earlier, compared with 6% in the first quarter and 7% for all of last year.Others are feeling the impact even more strongly. Total average loans at Wells Fargo were up just 1% from a year earlier, compared with 4% in the first quarter.Bankers across the country have said that businesses are hesitant to take out big loans, partly due to uncertainty about policy action in Washington. This could help explain why J.P. Morgan Chase chief executive       James Dimon       showed his frustration with the state of public policy in the U.S. by letting out a curse on Friday\u2019s conference call with analysts.While the Federal Reserve\u2019s rate increases help banks earn more on their loans, part of this benefit is lost when long-term rates decline. That is what happened for most of the second quarter. There was some hope in recent weeks as yields jumped on 10-year Treasurys. But that trend reversed Friday morning when the yield fell a sharp five basis points following weak economic data, putting additional pressure on bank shares.The fundamental direction for J.P. Morgan and its peers remains positive. The economy is healthy and they were just granted permission by the Federal Reserve to boost their payouts to investors. If the Fed follows through with plans to keep raising rates and start shrinking its balance sheet later this year, the rate environment will improve further.But bank shares are also no longer cheap. J.P. Morgan, for instance, is trading at 1.4-times book value, compared to just 1-times book a year ago. After a move like that, banks need to justify higher valuations with better growth.

However, because Mr. Levin\u2019s clients are told his firm doesn\u2019t accept any transfer requests over email, he wrote back and said he thought the request was a fake. Almost immediately, he says, he received a return email telling him the request was real.Mr. Levin then called the client, who said she hadn\u2019t made the request and didn\u2019t know about the email. This confirmed his suspicion that the emails were from a hacker who was monitoring the client\u2019s email account in real time.Mr. Levin says his client thinks her email was hacked when she printed a boarding pass from a hotel computer. This prompted Mr. Levin to tell clients to avoid public computers and unsecured Wi-Fi.He also says the experience reinforced his firm\u2019s procedure of always calling clients at their number on record\u2014and not a number that may be listed in an email\u2014to verify any transfer requests. \u201cThere can be no shortcuts,\u201d he says.Financial advisers like Mr. Levin are increasingly warning clients about the threat of cybercrime and identity theft. Cybercrime costs the global economy about $450 billion each year, according to 2016 report by Hamilton Place Strategies, a consulting firm whose clients include large banks. Two particular security risks advisers are concerned about: credit-card skimming and smart home devices.Credit-card skimmers\u2014small devices attached to a credit-card machine or automated-teller machine to steal user information\u2014have been a favorite of thieves for years. And for good reason: People are still getting snared by them.Nathan Mersereau,        a Bloomfield Hills, Mich., financial adviser knows the damage a skimmed credit card can cause\u2014because, he believes, his own credit card and identity were stolen when he was on vacation abroad.The experience cost Mr. Mersereau countless hours fighting fraudulent charges. It also prevented him from getting his tax refund for more than two years because someone, using personal details they had gotten from his stolen information, had claimed his tax refund.\u201cYou want to resolve everything right away, but you\u2019re not in direct control,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was one of the most frustrating experiences of my life.\u201dNow Mr. Mersereau tells clients to be cautious where they use their credit cards and to review all of their credit-card and monthly financial statements and question even small charges as a crook may be testing the account monitoring and charge larger amounts later if no red flags are raised, Mr. Mersereau says.He says it can help to put alerts on your credit card so you\u2019re notified about charges over a certain amount or to track all purchases made with the card.And since he\u2019s had to replace his credit cards three times in each of the past two years, he tells clients to regularly check their credit reports to make sure no accounts have been opened without their knowledge. To challenge an account that\u2019s been opened fraudulently, contact the lender and the credit bureau to file disputes.Hackers have traditionally targeted personal computers, but smart home devices can give hackers the keys to your life, says Lisa Lindsay, executive director at the Private Risk Management Association based in Fall River, Mass.Connected thermostats, lighting systems, smart TVs and security systems may make life easier, she says, but they could give hackers knowledge about a family\u2019s whereabouts and expose the home to theft or vandalism.Silka Gonzalez,        a cybersecurity expert who works with Mr. Mersereau\u2019s clients on emerging threats, says smart home technology is particularly vulnerable to bad actors.Ms. Gonzalez, president of Enterprise Risk Management in Coral Gables, Fla., says a crook could conceivably hack into one device and then exploit that security weakness to hack into other devices such as a home computer that may contain important financial data.As protection, first change the default passwords on smart devices, she says. Use passwords that are a combination of letters, numbers and special characters, if the device allows that, she says. Apply periodic operating system upgrades and disconnect the devices when not in use, Ms. Gonzalez says.She also says to connect smart home devices to one network and then use a separate secure network for any device that stores or accesses their financial data such as bank statements.\u201cHackers are creative and evolve with technology so you need to stay alert,\u201d she says.Write to Veronica Dagher at veronica.dagher@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-14 10:47:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/for-some-advisers-warnings-on-id-theft-hacking-threats-come-from-experience-1500043637", "news_title": "For Some Advisers, Warnings on ID Theft, Hacking Threats Come From Experience", "keywords": "Ross Levin,political,general news,crime,legal action,fraud,cybercrime,hacking,identity theft,banking,credit types,services,credit cards,financial investments,credit,financial services,investing,securities,plastic cards,private banking,wealth management"}, {"content": "When       Donald Trump Jr.       released emails on Tuesday detailing a June 2016 meeting, the news was greeted in many quarters with two words: \u201csmoking gun.\u201d The meeting involved a Russian lawyer with Kremlin ties who promised to supply damaging information about       Hillary Clinton       to boost Donald Trump\u2019s candidacy.That night on MSNBC, for instance,       Chris Matthews      opened his show \u201cHardball\u201d by asking rhetorically, \u201cHow do you say \u2018smoking gun\u2019 in Russian?\u201d Later, Mr. Matthews opined, \u201cThis is as close to a smoking gun as I\u2019ve seen,\u201d while his guest, former Assistant Special Watergate Prosecutor Nick Akerman, went a step further: \u201cLegally, this is a smoking cannon.\u201dPresident Trump defended his son, saying there was nothing wrong with taking the meeting, and has called the media attention paid to possible Russia ties a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201dSince the days of Watergate, \u201csmoking gun\u201d has served as a vivid metaphor for incontrovertible proof of wrongdoing. In this case, the email exchange has been cast as surefire evidence that the Trump campaign was actively colluding with the Russian government to bring down Mrs. Clinton.The image of a freshly discharged weapon as \u201csmoking\u201d has long been common in depictions of crimes both real-life and fictional. In a Sherlock Holmes story published in 1893,       Arthur Conan Doyle       wrote, \u201cthe chaplain stood with a smoking pistol in his hand at his elbow.\u201d In 1936,       Carroll John Daly       published \u201cThe Mystery of the Smoking Gun.\u201dWhen lawyers for Sirhan Sirhan, the man convicted of assassinating       Robert F. Kennedy,        presented an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court in 1972, they conceded that Mr. Sirhan was \u201ccaptured at the scene wielding a still-smoking gun.\u201dSoon thereafter, the \u201csmoking gun\u201d (or \u201cpistol\u201d) moved in a more figurative direction with the Watergate investigations into       Richard Nixon       and his aides. In a July 6, 1974, article, syndicated columnist       Mary McGrory       quoted a member of the House Judiciary Committee complaining that Nixon loyalists would only accept impeachment charges if there were \u201ca smoking pistol with fingerprints on it.\u201dThe following week in the             New York Times,      Roger Wilkins       wrote that \u201cthe big question\u201d being asked by House committee members was, \u201cWhere\u2019s the smoking gun?\u201d The committee would soon have the evidence it needed when, in August 1974, Nixon admitted to withholding the tape of an Oval Office conversation that incriminated him in the Watergate coverup. \u201cI guess we have found the smoking gun, haven\u2019t we?\u201d Republican congressman Barber Conable was quoted as saying.Even after Nixon resigned, the \u201csmoking gun\u201d remained in the political lexicon. In 2002, national security adviser       Condoleezza Rice       famously justified the imminent invasion of Iraq by saying, \u201cWe don\u2019t want the smoking gun to be a mushroom cloud.\u201d Smoking guns, in the form of weapons of mass destruction, were never found.Will Donald Trump Jr.\u2019s emails constitute a \u201csmoking gun\u201d this time around?

Are fakes a big deal for the industry? How do I spot one?A: The leading watch brands enjoy profits, prestige and a particular sort of glamour. Like other purveyors of luxury, however, they pay the unavoidable price of that success: fakes.Faking watches is big business\u2014and yes, also a big deal. While about 30 million real Swiss watches are produced annually, the Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry (FH) estimates that one to two million fake timepieces are seized and destroyed every year.Two types of fake watches exist. The first are cheap fakes, priced anywhere from $50 to the low three figures. You\u2019ll find them on the streets of big cities and on innumerable websites, where they\u2019re often spun oxymoronically as \u201cgenuine replicas.\u201d With these watches, the external parts\u2014case, dial, hands, bracelet\u2014are usually shoddy versions of authentic components and the internal movement is flimsy and unreliable. Cheap fakes look and feel like phonies; sellers rarely try to pass them off as anything else, so at least you know what you are getting.Then there are \u201csuper fakes,\u201d watches intended to fool people into believing they are the real thing. Here, the external parts closely resemble those of authentic timepieces, while the movements are often Chinese or Japanese clones of Swiss movements disguised with engravings and decorations. To finesse the deception, super fakes usually come in near-perfect copies of brand boxes and are accompanied by counterfeit \u201cproof of authenticity\u201d papers. You might think you\u2019d recognize a fake, but these are quite craftily well-done.While super fakes can be produced for a few hundred dollars, sellers hope to unload them for the same four-, five- or even six-figure sum the Real McCoys command. Genuine watches have internal components that fakers cannot cheaply duplicate so the duped buyer often discovers the truth only when the watch is opened up and examined under a loupe. If you think a watch might be a super fake, this is unfortunately the only way to be sure.\u2018Watch counterfeiters often use hazardous materials like lead.\u2019You might ask: What\u2019s the harm in buying one if the price is right? Well, watch-faking is not a victimless crime. Apart from involving stolen intellectual property, fake watches can be physically dangerous. Counterfeiters often use hazardous materials such as lead, cadmium and mercury, which are banned in many consumer products, including watches. And super fakes often function poorly, which can become a life-threatening failure if you\u2019re, say, a scuba diver and your dive watch malfunctions underwater.Most disturbingly, according to a joint report by nine U.S. government agencies published earlier this year, profits from the sale of fake watches (and other counterfeit goods) fund organized crime, drug trafficking and terrorism.If you\u2019re the sort of person who would never buy a cheap fake, the question becomes: How do you avoid mistakenly purchasing a super fake? Regular readers of this column know I recommend buying new watches only from a brand or authorized dealer. While there are other legitimate online sellers, including individuals on sites like eBay, it\u2019s easy to be fooled. Watch out for obvious red flags such as negative or outdated reviews on sites which include reviews. Also suspect are blurry photographs or ones that are clearly stolen from a brand\u2019s website and don\u2019t depict the timepiece that\u2019s actually being sold. If contacting the site is even a little difficult, don\u2019t buy. And while you might be tempted by, say, a Breitling Navitimer for $2,000\u2014much less than the $8,000 to $48,000 a brand-new one usually costs\u2014if a price seems too good to be true, it probably is. For further vigilance, always buy using             PayPal                   or a credit card that offers protection on purchases. You may be able to reclaim some of your money if you\u2019re duped.", "news_time": "2017-07-14 10:13:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-to-avoid-the-craftiest-counterfeit-watches-1500041598", "news_title": "How to Avoid the Craftiest Counterfeit Watches", "keywords": "counterfeit watches,knockoffs,menswear,watches,political,general news,counterfeit,forgery,crime,legal action,fake news phenomenon,fraud"}, {"content": "After serving in the British Army, Michael Sandberg joined Hongkong & Shanghai Banking Corp. in 1948. Life East Asia at the time, he recalled later, was \u201cwas like turning the clock back 50 years to an era of elegance and servants.\u201dBy the time he became chairman of Hongkong Bank in 1977, he realized the future would look very different. He almost immediately began negotiating an agreement leading to Hongkong Bank\u2019s acquisition of Marine Midland Banks Inc. of New York, the first in a series of deals that created today\u2019s global HSBC Holdings PLC.He embraced       Li Ka-shing       and other rising Chinese entrepreneurs who were starting to eclipse the British colonial companies that had dominated Hong Kong. He also spent about $670 million on a futuristic Hong Kong headquarters designed for the bank by Norman Foster.Critics saw the bank headquarters, completed in the mid-1980s, as extravagant, but Mr. Sandberg said the bank needed a \u201ctop-of-the-pops building,\u201d signaling confidence in Hong Kong as China prepared to regain sovereignty over the colony in 1997. The bank also provided him a mansion called Skyhigh in Hong Kong\u2019s Peak district.After retiring from Hongkong Bank in 1986, he served as Lord Sandberg in Britain\u2019s House of Lords.He died July 2 in Hindhead, England. He was 90.Michael Graham Ruddock Sandberg was born on May 31, 1927, in Thames Ditton, a village near London. His father worked at the Bank of England. Young Michael attended St. Edward\u2019s boarding school in Oxford. Dispensing with further education, he joined the Army near the end of World War II and was sent first to India, where he served as an officer in the Sixth Lancers, and later to Palestine and Libya, with the First King\u2019s Dragoon Guards. His regiment occasionally found time to hunt on horseback for jackals.After returning to England, he found his homeland drab. In search of further adventure, he accepted a job at Hongkong Bank in 1948. The bank, founded in 1865 to finance trade with China, employed him briefly in London before dispatching him to Asia. He had assignments in Japan and Singapore before returning to the head office in Hong Kong. During a vacation in Ireland, he met Carmel Donnelly. She turned down his first two proposals, but they were married in 1954.Hongkong Bank was then so powerful in the colony that it was known simply as \u201cthe bank.\u201d It issued most of the Hong Kong dollars in circulation and owned stakes in a shipping company, an airline and a newspaper. Bank officers worked a 5\u00bd day week, ending at noon Saturday, when a cart was wheeled around to dispense pink gin and other refreshments.Mr. Sandberg also served as chairman of the Royal Hong Kong Jockey Club, the operator of a horse-racing track and luxurious refuge for the colony\u2019s Chinese and British elite. Though his schedule was packed with business and social engagements, he made it a priority to get home in time to watch the TV show \u201cGet Smart\u201d once a week with his children.For all the comforts of expatriate life, Hong Kong was often an edgy place, lurching from property boom to bust depending on sentiment about developments in China. Mr. Sandberg wanted to create a \u201cthree-legged stool,\u201d with substantial banking interests in North America and Europe to balance those in Asia. Marine Midland provided a U.S. base, though it suffered losses on loans related to commercial real estate and Latin America in the late 1980s and early 1990s.Hongkong Bank also bought a British stockbroker, James Capel & Co., in the mid-1980s but British regulators blocked Mr. Sandberg from acquiring             Royal Bank of Scotland.       After his retirement, HSBC bought Britain\u2019s Midland Bank PLC.One blot on Mr. Sandberg\u2019s term as chairman was the bank\u2019s heavy lending to the Carrian group, a Hong Kong property company that collapsed amid allegations of fraud in 1983.He stepped down in 1986, saying that nine years as chairman was \u201cabout enough\u201d and that \u201cyou go when you\u2019ve got someone very good to take over.\u201d His successor, William Purves, a Scotsman, was more cautious about frills and global expansion. The bank sold the Skyhigh mansion after Mr. Sandberg retired.Mr. Sandberg\u2019s passions included watching cricket and horse racing. He owned race horses in Hong Kong and England and raised money for the Surrey County Cricket Club, operator of the Oval in London, one of Britain\u2019s hallowed athletic grounds, where he was a regular spectator in recent years.He also collected antique pocket watches. \u201cOnce bitten by the intricacies of the movement in some instances and by the sheer beauty in others, my enthusiasm for old timepieces became immense,\u201d he told The Wall Street Journal in 2001.Mr. Sandberg is survived by his wife of 63 years, their four children, six grandchildren and a great granddaughter.Write to James R.

Spencer Johnson, who gave up a career as a doctor to write children\u2019s books, was at a party in 1980 in San Diego when he met the management consultant and author Kenneth Blanchard and his wife, Margie. \u201cYou two ought to write a children\u2019s book for managers,\u201d Ms. Blanchard blurted.Within two months, that idea became the first draft of \u201cThe One Minute Manager,\u201d one of the best-selling books of the 1980s, whose spinoffs and reprints still sell briskly. Dr. Johnson went on to write another huge hit, a parable about the need to accept and adapt to change called \u201cWho Moved My Cheese?\u201dA critic once described one of Spencer Johnson\u2019s books as a work of \u201cstupefying banality.\u201d Dr. Johnson didn\u2019t need to worry about critics, however. Before handing a book to his publisher, he tested it with hundreds of readers, his target audience. He knew what they wanted. He knew what would sell.His \u201cWho Moved My Cheese\u201d has sold more than 28 million copies globally and has been translated into 44 languages. Like his other books, it can be read in 45 minutes or so.His career as an author showed that the idea behind a book needn\u2019t be original nor profound, so long as readers find it useful and easy to digest. As his family put it in a tribute, he offered \u201csimple truths that lead to fulfillment and success.\u201dDr. Johnson died July 3 in San Diego. He was 78 and had pancreatic cancer.\u201cMost writers write the book they want to write,\u201d he told USA Today in 2003. \u201cYou\u2019re much wiser if you write the book people want to read.\u201dPatrick Spencer Johnson, who was born Nov. 24, 1938, in Watertown, S.D., grew up in Los Angeles. He earned a degree in psychology from the University of Southern California and a medical degree from the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland.He found his work as a physician frustrating. The same patients kept coming back regardless of the treatment. Margret McBride, one of his agents, said Dr. Johnson told her he concluded it would be better to change the way people thought and felt about themselves. \u201cHe wanted to fix them from the inside,\u201d she said.He took a job in communications for             Medtronic,       a maker of medical devices, and discovered a knack for explaining complicated matters in plain English. In collaboration with his first wife, Ann Donegan, he began writing a series of children\u2019s books drawing lessons from the lives of Louis Pasteur, the Wright Brothers, Jackie Robinson and others.After he met Dr. Blanchard, they began giving seminars to business people and selling an early, self-published version of \u201cThe One Minute Manager\u201d for $15 a book. After speaking to the National Restaurant Association, they sold 1,200 copies on the spot, Dr. Blanchard said: \u201cPeople were grabbing them like it was candy.\u201dDr. Johnson and his agent began talking to publishers in New York. Some suggested that such a slim book should be priced at no more than $8 or so. Dr. Johnson was incensed, noting that he already was selling the book for $15 and suggesting that any publisher who couldn\u2019t do as well must be in the \u201clittle leagues.\u201d William Morrow & Co. agreed to publish the book at $15. It was released with a gold star affixed to the cover describing the book as \u201csmall, expensive and invaluable.\u201dWriting parables isn\u2019t as easy as it looks, said Ms. McBride.

Dr. Navarro-Valls was a member of that primarily lay Catholic organization, which teaches that secular work can be a form of devotional religious activity.As Vatican spokesman under St. John Paul II and Pope Benedict XVI, Dr. Navarro-Valls introduced elements of a professional communications apparatus, including regular briefings for reporters and the advance distribution of speeches and writings.More significantly, he provided authoritative interpretations of often opaque papal pronouncements and shaped coverage of the Vatican more successfully than his predecessors or successors.Dr. Navarro-Valls was born Nov. 16, 1936, in Cartagena, Spain. He was one of five children of Joaqu\u00edn Navarro, a lawyer, and Conchita Valls, a homemaker. After attending a German school, he studied medicine at the Universities of Granada and Barcelona, graduating from the latter in 1961.By that time, he had joined Opus Dei as a numerary, a class of membership entailing a commitment to celibacy. While practicing as a psychiatrist, he was asked to serve as Opus Dei\u2019s spokesman in Barcelona. That led to him to study journalism at the organization\u2019s University of Navarre, where he received a degree in 1968.In a 2005 interview with an Italian journalist, Dr. Navarro-Valls said that medicine was his \u201cfirst love,\u201d but that journalism had helped him as a psychiatrist, by showing him the profound influence of the media on human thinking and emotion.In his Vatican role, he became perhaps the world\u2019s best-known member of Opus Dei after its founder, Msgr. Josemar\u00eda Escriv\u00e1, whom Pope John Paul canonized as a saint in 2002. Dr. Navarro-Valls discouraged questions about his membership in the controversial and conservative organization, insisting that it was irrelevant to his role and that the pope had chosen him for his journalism expertise.Starting in 1977, Dr. Navarro-Valls served as a Rome-based foreign correspondent for the Spanish newspaper ABC. He was twice elected, in 1983 and 1984, as president of Italy\u2019s foreign press association. It was that distinction, he said, that brought him to the attention of Pope John Paul, who made him director of the Holy See Press Office in 1984.Dr. Navarro-Valls\u2019 success at the Vatican reflected his journalism experience\u2014he was the first professional reporter and the first layman to serve as Vatican spokesman\u2014but also his extraordinary relationship with Pope John Paul.The elegant Spaniard often spoke directly with the pope and could speak confidently in his name, on and off the record. Dr. Navarro-Valls was one of a handful of people\u2014including the Vatican\u2019s doctrinal chief, Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, the future Pope Benedict\u2014to whom the Polish pope delegated enormous responsibility.Dr. Navarro-Valls acted as a high-level international negotiator when he met with Cuban President Fidel Castro before Pope John Paul\u2019s 1998 visit to the island. He conveyed the pope\u2019s request that the communist regime reinstate Christmas as a national holiday, and Mr. Castro agreed.Pope John Paul sent Dr. Navarro-Valls to several United Nations conferences, and his most prominent role was at the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development in Cairo.The Vatican spokesman\u2019s initiatives before and during the Cairo meeting galvanized a coalition including representatives of Islamic states that obtained an explicit rejection of abortion as a method of family planning.Dr. Navarro-Valls\u2019 closeness to Pope John Paul became clear to millions when he broke down at the podium during a press briefing the day before the pope\u2019s death in 2005. He stayed on in the position for a little more than a year under Pope Benedict, when his access to the papal apartment proved decisive at least one more time.Dr. Navarro-Valls noticed that the German pope\u2019s prepared speech for a May 2006 visit to Auschwitz lacked an instance of the word Shoah, the Hebrew term for the Holocaust. The pope added it on the spokesman\u2019s advice, likely avoiding a public relations contretemps of the kind that repeatedly marked the new pontificate after Dr. Navarro-Valls\u2019 departure.Speaking to The Wall Street Journal in 2015, Dr. Navarro-Valls stressed that easy access to the pope was essential to effective Vatican communications.Dr. Navarro-Valls is survived by three brothers.Write to Francis X.

It happened that some of their earliest customers were doctors and hospitals. That led to a focus on health care.Their timing was good. The drive to lower medical costs and improve care has created growing demand for better ways to manage treatments and manipulate electronic health records over the past several decades. Cerner Corp., the North Kansas City, Mo.-based company where Mr. Patterson served as chief executive for 38 years, now has more than 24,000 employees and a stock market value of about $22 billion.Mr. Patterson, an Ayn Rand devotee who grew up on an Oklahoma wheat farm, became a billionaire and part-owner of Sporting Kansas City, a professional soccer team.In 2001, he survived the embarrassment of a leaked email in which he accused Cerner employees of being slackers who thought they could coast on a 40-hour week. He later said people who knew him well realized he was exaggerating.Mr. Patterson died of cancer July 9 at his home in Loch Lloyd, Mo. He was 67.       Clifford Illig,        another co-founder, is serving as interim CEO.\u201cHe had the ability to look out there and see what the world was going to need in health care,\u201d Mr. Illig said of Mr. Patterson. \u201cHe was quite resolute. Some might call it maniacal.\u201dNeal Lynn Patterson was born Dec. 10, 1949, in Anthony, Kan. His parents were tenant farmers who later bought their own property. He and his brothers helped them plant and harvest wheat along the Oklahoma-Kansas border. His grade school was so small that young Neal was put into first grade a year early so the only other boy in the class would have a companion. He later qualified as an Eagle Scout.He raised livestock to support himself while attending Oklahoma State University, where he earned a master\u2019s degree in business administration in 1972. He then joined Arthur Andersen & Co. as an information systems consultant in Kansas City, Mo.\u201cBasically what we were doing then was companies would buy a computer and they would need software,\u201d Mr. Patterson told Forbes in 2012. \u201cI designed and developed an unbelievable number of applications early in my life.\u201d Seeing huge potential for software, he formed the company that became Cerner with two Andersen colleagues, Mr. Illig and       Paul Gorup.One of the new company\u2019s first big breaks was winning a contract to design a laboratory information system at a large hospital in Tulsa. The system automated such things as ordering tests, scheduling lab work, charting results and sending them to doctors.That led to many more contracts. \u201cWe really jumped on a rocket ship at that point,\u201d Mr. Illig said.In 2001, the company was in a lull after scrambling for years to upgrade computer systems to prevent potential Y2K computer glitches. Noticing that a company parking lot was sparsely occupied early in the morning and after 5 p.m., Mr. Patterson fumed.He typed a ferocious email to managers: \u201cAs managers\u2014you either do not know what your EMPLOYEES are doing; or you do not CARE. You have created expectations on the work effort which allowed this to happen inside Cerner, creating a very unhealthy environment. In either case, you have a problem and you will fix it or I will replace you.\u201dHe added: \u201cYou have two weeks. Tick, tock.\u201dThe email found its way onto a Yahoo website. Cerner\u2019s stock plunged as investors wondered whether the company was in serious trouble.\u2019\u2019I was trying to start a fire,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Patterson told the New York Times. \u2019\u2019I lit a match, and I started a firestorm.\u201dThe leaked rant was \u201ca little disruptive,\u201d Mr. Illig recalled, but only for a month or two.Mr. Patterson got back on message, talking about the potential for better computer systems to improve health care. Patients shouldn\u2019t have to lug shopping bags full of records from one doctor to the next, he said, and better information systems could foster more preventive care.Early last year, Mr. Patterson was diagnosed with soft tissue cancer. Later in the year, he said at a conference: \u201cI made a plan, got a strategy for treatment and then went to execute it. I realized God had a sense of humor: He put me in a place undergoing an EHR (electronic health records) conversion.\u201dMr. Patterson is survived by his wife, Jeanne Lillig-Patterson, four children, four grandchildren and two brothers.At Mr. Patterson\u2019s funeral in Leawood, Kan., on Thursday,       John C. Danforth,        a former U.S. senator from Missouri, described him as a man of action rather than words. \u201cHis words couldn\u2019t keep up with his thoughts,\u201d the Rev. Danforth said. \u201cHe spoke in half sentences, There was a staccato quality.\u201d Talking to Mr. Patterson, one associate said, was like listening to a popcorn machine.Write to James R.

He said in a note to clients he still expects a future rebound in the sales data, \u201cbut our patience is being tested.\u201d Excluding autos, sales were down 0.2% last month; economists had expected a 0.2% gain. Excluding both autos and gasoline, sales fell 0.1% in June, the first decline for the measure in nearly a year.In the second quarter, total retail sales were up just 0.2% from the first three months of the year. Overall retail sales rose 3.9% in the first half of 2017 compared with the same period a year earlier, well outpacing the recent trend for consumer-price inflation.Data on retail sales can be volatile from month to month, aren\u2019t adjusted for price changes and don\u2019t include spending on most services such as housing and health care. June\u2019s 0.2% decline from the prior month came with a 0.5 percentage point margin of error.Consumer spending is the main engine of the U.S. economy, accounting for more than two-thirds of total economic output. Household outlays slowed during the first quarter but appeared to rebound in the spring, despite the recent signs of weakness.\u201cGrowth in household spending, which was weak earlier in the year, has picked up in recent months and continues to be supported by job gains, rising household wealth and favorable consumer sentiment,\u201d Federal Reserve Chairwoman       Janet Yellen      told lawmakers this week. Gasoline-station sales fell 1.3% in June from the prior month and dropped 3.6% in the second quarter from the prior three months, according to the Commerce Department report. Global oil prices have moved lower in recent months, helping drive down the price of gasoline and the dollar value of sales at gas stations.Sales were uneven across other categories last month. Spending fell at grocery stores and restaurants, but rose at auto dealerships and building-material-and-garden-equipment shops.U.S. retail chains have announced thousands of store closures this year, as American shoppers increasingly shift their spending from brick-and-mortar stores to e-commerce platforms like             Amazon.com.Sales at department stores fell 0.7% last month and were down 3.9% from June 2016.

On the coup night tanks closed traffic in Istanbul and crowds of people helped overpower the mutineers, in clashes that left many dead.The display of people power increased optimism the polarized country could start a new chapter of political unity. That feeling quickly fizzled after authorities started jailing tens of thousands of people and firing similar numbers from the civil service on allegations of supporting terror groups.Opponents of the government now accuse it of using the coup as a pretext to roll back civil liberties and suppress their dissent.The main opposition Republican People\u2019s Party, or CHP, whose lawmakers are the second-largest bloc in parliament, said that they hadn\u2019t been formally invited to a special session at parliament planned for early Sunday in which Mr. Erdogan will speak to the nation. Prime Minister       Binali Yildirim       said there is no need for the main opposition party to take offense, as the ruling party also don\u2019t have a formal written invitation.Across Turkey, restaurants are offering free food for families of the 249 people killed in the fighting during the night of the attempted coup.All municipalities are obeying government decrees to decorate streets and public squares with bunting, billboards and other decorations.Yet it is mainly in the AKP strongholds where the most enthusiastic celebrations are being planned and where local officials are organizing extra events beyond the packed official schedule planned for Saturday and Sunday.Official ceremonies in Istanbul will kick off this weekend in the Uskudar neighborhood on the Asian side of the city. Mr. Erdogan will also inaugurate the July 15 Memorial at the mouth of the July 15 Martyrs\u2019 Bridge, formerly known as the Bosporus Bridge, which links the Asian and European sides of the city. Tens of thousands are expected to join a \u201cdemocracy march\u201d across it.The AKP is expecting huge crowds to gather overnight Saturday to Sunday in all-night government-sponsored \u201cdemocracy vigils.\u201d In Taksim Square, the symbolic heart of central Istanbul, a government-sponsored photo exhibition and a newly unveiled statue representing pro-government soldiers killed in the fight with the putschists is already drawing thousands.Ayse Albayrak, an engineering student, said her whole family were planning to return to Taksim on Saturday night. \u201cWe all need to remember when our leader saved us from terrorism,\u201d she said, referring to Mr. Erdogan.In Bakirkoy, a CHP neighborhood on the European side of Istanbul, the municipality said it has encouraged its employees to attend July 15 commemorations. The CHP municipality in Maltepe on the Asian side of the city also is planning a prayer tent, while an official from the CHP-run Besiktas municipality on the European side of Istanbul said it would open its own Democracy Memorial and hold a prayer service for those killed.However, deep political divides remain in various Istanbul neighborhoods.Several residents in Maltepe said they wouldn\u2019t join the democracy vigils. \u201cThose events are for another part of Turkey, not my Turkey,\u201d said       Aydin Yilmaz,        a cafe owner.The government\u2019s weekend events come on the heels of a political opposition rally led by CHP Chairman       Kemal Kilicdaroglu.       He ended a nearly one-month protest march from the capital Ankara to an Istanbul suburb last Sunday at a rally that organizers said drew more than 1 million sympathizers. The Istanbul Governor\u2019s office said that around 175,000 people attended.Mr. Erdogan and the government blame U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen for plotting the botched coup, an accusation he denies.In the continuing state of emergency called in the wake of the coup, the government continues its detentions and arrests.On Thursday, Turkish police detained       Ali Avci,        a producer of a movie called \u201cThe Chief,\u201d a hagiographic biopic about Mr. Erdogan that premiered this year but flopped at the box office. A trailer for his new movie called \u201cAwakening\u201d about the failed coup drew criticism as it appeared to show a dramatic reinterpretation of the coup night in which Mr. Erdogan\u2019s family is shot and an army officer aims a gun at the back of the president\u2019s head as he kneels in prayer.The state-run Anadolu news agency said Mr. Avci was detained on the accusation of being a follower of       Mr. Gulen.       Mr. Avci couldn\u2019t be reached for comment and it is unclear whether he has been granted access to a lawyer.\u2014Margaret Coker contributed to this article.Write to Yeliz Candemir at yeliz.candemir@wsj.comAppeared in the July 15, 2017, print edition as 'Ankara Marks Coup Anniversary.'", "news_time": "2017-07-14 09:36:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/turkey-marks-coup-anniversary-as-divisions-remain-1500039413", "news_title": "Turkey Marks Coup Anniversary as Divisions Remain ", "keywords": "erdogan,turkish coup,Recep Tayyip Erdogan,political,general news,national,public security,armed rebellion,crime,legal action,politics,international relations,domestic politics,risk news,state security measures,policies,terrorism,military action"}, {"content": "When hedge-fund manager       Daniel Loeb       needed help making a $3.5 billion wager on             Nestl\u00e9 SA,       he turned to the man who is behind some of Wall Street\u2019s biggest activist bets:       Gregg Hymowitz.The chief executive of EnTrustPermal in May approved a $650 million investment in Nestl\u00e9 alongside Mr. Loeb\u2019s Third Point LLC, a huge sum for a single investor.Mr. Hymowitz\u2019s willingness to write such large checks on short notice makes the 51-year-old a potent weapon when managers are quietly trying to amass meaningful stakes in companies. The New York investment firm this year has backed Trian Fund Management LP\u2019s $3.3 billion Procter & Gamble Co. stake and Mantle Ridge LP\u2019s $1 billion CSX Corp. investment, among others. The $650 million Nestl\u00e9 investment, which includes money from sovereign-wealth funds and state pensions, is its biggest co-investment to date, giving EnTrustPermal a total of more than $6 billion tied up in such single-bet wagers, or co-investments.EnTrustPermal, which told clients it had $24.5 billion in assets under management at the end of May, is primarily a fund-of-hedge-funds firm; it pools clients\u2019 money and invests in a range of hedge funds, charging a layer of fees on top of the fees charged by hedge-fund managers themselves. Increasingly, EnTrustPermal is focusing on co-investments, including activist campaigns and corporate debt restructurings.Such concentrated wagers can offer clients fatter returns at lower fees, though they also carry more risk and lock up investors\u2019 money for years. Some investors say they don\u2019t try to source these deals themselves because their staffs are already stretched thin.EnTrustPermal\u2019s emphasis on co-investments is intended to help it survive a shakeout among funds-of-hedge-funds firms. Investors have been pulling money from these funds each year since 2007, according to research firm HFR Inc., and their number has slumped 40% over that period to roughly 1,500 at the end of March. The hedge funds they invest in have posted disappointing returns on average, and clients\u2019 willingness to pay an additional layer of fees has shrunk.EnTrustPermal hasn\u2019t been immune to the pressures. Its assets under management through the end of March dropped about 15% since January 2016; the firm\u2019s co-investment funds have fared better than its traditional funds of hedge funds.Clients in its traditional funds of hedge funds also make co-investments through EnTrustPermal, and the co-investments have drawn new clients to the firm, Mr. Hymowitz said.Critics say co-investments require investors to pay extra fees to hold easily accessible stocks, then lock up their money for years. There also are risks to taking concentrated bets. EnTrustPermal lost more than 5% on its co-investment with Corvex Management LP in energy-pipeline operator Williams Cos., after an agreed upon sale to Energy Transfer Equity LP failed last year. EnTrust later backed Corvex\u2019s bet on Yum Brands Inc. and more than recouped the losses, according to people familiar with the matter.Firm executives say some activists stay quiet, and clients can benefit from changes managers make behind the scenes. The firm also joins on less-accessible deals and tries to protect clients by negotiating fees.Mr. Hymowitz hails from Bellmore, on Long Island, and speaks with a New York accent. He and three of his daughters sport \u201cH\u201d tattoos, a nod to their last name, a person familiar with the matter said.Formerly on a team of private managers to the wealthy at             Goldman Sachs Group Inc.,       he and two others left in 1997 to start EnTrust Capital. One partner later retired; Mr. Hymowitz bought out the other.He says he found his business motto when he met the singer Usher in 2012 at a friend\u2019s wedding weekend. Seated at Usher\u2019s table, Mr. Hymowitz says he asked the performer how he made the transition from child artist to adult star. Usher, he recalls, told him his philosophy: \u201cEvolve or evaporate.\u201d\u201cEver since that lunch, I\u2019ve used that,\u201d Mr. Hymowitz said. \u201cYou have to evolve or evaporate with this business.\u201dWhen an activist pitches a new idea, Mr. Hymowitz doesn\u2019t grill him on valuations or specifics, managers said. He leaves the detailed vetting to others at the firm and focuses on the manager and the idea. \u201cHe\u2019s there to smell you,\u201d one activist said.He agreed in 2016 to combine his then-$12 billion firm with             Legg Mason Inc.\u2019s       roughly $17 billion fund-of-hedge-funds business, Permal Group. Legg Mason paid about $400 million for a 65% stake in the combined entity.EnTrust\u2019s recent surge in co-investments coincides with ramped-up activist activity, as the biggest funds go after giant companies. Third Point\u2019s Nestl\u00e9 bet and Trian\u2019s P&G investments are their biggest wagers and rank among the largest-ever activist campaigns.Many of Mr. Hymowitz\u2019s clients are pension funds that oversee money for private and public workers. These investors can balk at the idea of helping Wall Street activists, who often turn to cost-cutting to improve a company\u2019s results.One such client, the $7 billion United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, based in Washington, D.C., said it steers clear of co-investing in activist campaigns targeting food companies because they might result in job losses or pay cuts for some of its members. But the multiemployer pension has co-invested in other activist bets offered by Mr. Hymowitz.\u201cIt helps us juice the returns a little bit without necessarily increasing our risk profile too much,\u201d said UFCW President       Marc Perrone,        which has roughly $100 million with EnTrustPermal.Write to Juliet Chung at juliet.chung@wsj.com and David Benoit at david.benoit@wsj.comAppeared in the July 15, 2017, print edition as 'The Money Man for Activist Investors.'", "news_time": "2017-07-14 09:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-man-behind-activist-investors-biggest-bets-1500037200", "news_title": "The Man Behind Activist Investors\u2019 Biggest Bets ", "keywords": "activist investors,entrustpermal,fund of hedge funds,Mantle Ridge,CSX,Third Point,Nestle,NESN.EB,NESN.VX,Procter & Gamble,PG,Trian Fund Management,Corvex Management,EnTrust Capital,Goldman Sachs Group,GS,Legg Mason,LM,Yum Brands,YUM,Daniel Loeb,Gregg Hymowitz,Marc Perrone,management,shareholder activism,corporate,industrial news,corporate governance,cosmetics,toiletries,food,beverages,tobacco,railroads,trusts,funds,financial vehicles,alternative investments,freight transport,logistics,consumer goods,financial services,food products,hedge funds,investing,securities,personal care products,appliances,road,rail transport,railroad freight,transportation"}, {"content": "AURORA, Ill.\u2014This former factory town outside Chicago is known for its riverboat casino, a painstakingly restored downtown theater\u2014and two guys playing bad guitar in a basement.Twenty-five years after \u201cWayne\u2019s World\u201d hit the movie screen, this town of 200,000 just finished celebrating the pair, but is still trying to figure out what it thinks of them.From February through July, the Chicago suburb held karaoke contests, poster-making, trivia, doughnut tasting, movie screenings, a look-alike contest and air guitar battles to celebrate the film, which starred \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d castmates Mike Myers and Dana Carvey in their recurring roles as hosts of an irreverent, rock \u2019n\u2019 roll public access television show.It all culminated in a July 4 attempt to break the Guinness World Record for the greatest number of people simultaneously headbanging, scored to a live rendition of Queen\u2019s \u201cBohemian Rhapsody\u201d by the Fox Valley Orchestra.\u201cThere was a big cohort of people that were like, \u2018This is great, we\u2019re so excited!

The actress Tia Carrere, who played Wayne\u2019s girlfriend, made an appearance in February.Jennifer Rauch, who moved to Aurora 15 years ago and dreamed up the idea for the celebration, was the same age as the characters when the first film came out.\u201cIt was just one of those timely, topical, when you\u2019re in your mid-20s and you\u2019re still trying to find yourself movies,\u201d said Ms. Rauch, who runs a framing shop and art gallery downtown. \u201cHere\u2019s where I was 25 years ago and here\u2019s where I am now. The hair\u2019s not as big.\u201dBut others were less enthusiastic.\u201cI, quite honestly, am a little bit over it. Just because I haven\u2019t seen the movie and it\u2019s been six months now and I\u2019m like, \u2018OK, can we focus on something else?\u2019\u201d said Kim Granholm, president of Aurora Downtown, the property owners association that helped organize the festivities.Visitors from out of state flocked to the July 4 headbanging, where more than a 1,000 people, many clad in flannel, snaked their way into the designated dance zone, mugging for cellphone videos and shouting \u201cParty on!\u201d to no one in particular.Bobby Dobroski of Des Plaines, Ill., sporting a stringy blonde wig, attended the headbanging with his wife, Emily, to celebrate their first wedding anniversary.\u201cIt\u2019s just a funny movie that you can quote over and over again and it never gets boring,\u201d said Mr. Dobroski, a preschool teacher who plays \u201cBohemian Rhapsody\u201d for his students during their naptime.With a camera-equipped drone flying overhead to capture the historic undertaking, Ms. Sturges took the stage following the final chords of Queen\u2019s anthem to announce that Aurora had indeed shattered the previous headbanging record, tripling the old mark.A fedora-wearing MC in red pants grabbed the microphone and proclaimed: \u201cThis is how you celebrate the birthday of America.\u201dAurora residents who grimaced at the notion of six months of Wayne\u2019s World are sure to be heartened by a decidedly more highbrow event later this month. A hip downtown coffee shop on July 28 will showcase the contemporary abstract works of local artist Maureen Gasek in support of the Kiwanis Shining Bright Literacy Program.But two days later, it is back to the movies as Aurora plays host to a Harry Potter-themed extravaganza set to feature a search for Horcruxes, a Hogwarts Express mini-train attraction, potions classes and a re-creation of Diagon Alley along the town\u2019s Water Street Mall.Ms. Rauch said it is unlikely that the town will organize events to mark the 25th anniversary of Wayne\u2019s World 2, released in December 1993, but there may be another celebration in the works. \u201cI think we\u2019re just going to wait for the 30th [anniversary] for the original.\u201dWrite to Quint Forgey at quint.forgey@wsj.comAppeared in the July 15, 2017, print edition as '\u2018Wayne\u2019s World\u2019 Town Partied On.'", "news_time": "2017-07-14 09:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/despite-reservations-about-wayne-and-garth-aurora-partied-on-1500037203", "news_title": "Despite Reservations About Wayne and Garth, Aurora \u2018Partied On!\u2019    ", "keywords": "aurora,garth,headbanger,headbanging,party on,schwing,wayne,wayne's world,political,general news,arts,entertainment,movies"}, {"content": "A few months ago, the dancer Wendy Whelan gave away all of her ballet leotards. Sitting on the steps outside a Manhattan dance studio, she now says of ballet, \u201cI\u2019m over it.\u201d It\u2019s been a long process: In October 2014, Ms. Whelan, 50, reluctantly retired from the New York City Ballet after 30 years there\u201423 as a principal dancer, the company\u2019s highest rank. Now, she\u2019s reinventing herself as a contemporary dancer.During her time at City Ballet, she performed featured roles in such notable works as \u201cSymphony in Three Movements\u201d and \u201cSwan Lake.\u201d She also inspired more than 40 new dances by choreographers such as Christopher Wheeldon and Alexei Ratmansky. In 2007, Ms. Whelan was nominated for a Laurence Olivier Award for outstanding achievement in dance, and in 2011, she won a Bessie Award for sustained achievement in performance.Ms. Whelan is now the subject of a documentary in theaters, \u201cRestless Creature.\u201d Directed by Linda Saffire and Adam Schlesinger, the film chronicles her last year with City Ballet and her struggle to come to terms with how her age affects her performance. \u201cI feel the ticking clock,\u201d she says in the film, adding, \u201cIf I don\u2019t dance, I\u2019d rather die.\u201d (She later makes fun of her hyperbole.)Ms. Whelan describes the moment she realized it was the beginning of the end. Six years ago, she says, City Ballet artistic director Peter Martins told her that she should no longer perform as the Sugarplum Fairy in \u201cThe Nutcracker,\u201d a role that she had danced for more than 20 years. The conversation \u201cflipped everything on its head,\u201d she says as she leans her wisp-thin frame against a railing. \u201cIt hurt.\u201d City Ballet didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\u2018One day, things didn\u2019t fit anymore in ballet place.\u2019Her body was also starting to wear down. In 2012, she slipped and hurt her hip. The injury continued to get more painful, she recalls, and in 2013, she had hip surgery. She worried that she was getting too old for the demands of ballet, which is difficult on dancers\u2019 hips and joints. Still, her career lasted much longer than average: Many quit professional ballet by their early 30s. \u201cI felt a rigidity coming on in that strictness of the upright\u201d posture in ballet, she says. \u201cOne day, things didn\u2019t fit anymore in ballet place.\u201dWhen she was first approached by the filmmakers, Ms. Whelan hesitated to participate. But after agreeing to be filmed for one day, she realized that documenting the difficult parts of her experience could help her deal with them. In the film, she tears up as she talks about the idea of leaving the company. \u201cI\u2019m not a crying kind of person, so it was just odd to see myself like that,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s part of my ballet-ness,\u201d she adds. \u201cI don\u2019t want to show my vulnerabilities.\u201dThe documentary follows her through her months in physical therapy to recover from the hip surgery. The process took longer than she thought. She realized that she wasn\u2019t likely to return to ballet full-time, so she finally decided to leave the company. Her mother, a former basketball coach and physical education teacher who lives in Louisville, Ky., also appears in the film, as she comes to watch Ms. Whelan\u2019s final performance with City Ballet.Her mother and father, an accountant, first encouraged Ms. Whelan to take up ballet when she was young. \u201cI was apparently a little hyperactive,\u201d she says, and ballet was a way to get her out of the house. Ms. Whelan used to pick on her younger sister, who is now a homicide detective. \u201cI guess she learned to protect herself\u2014and others,\u201d she says with a laugh.At age 13, she won a scholarship for the School of American Ballet\u2019s summer course in New York. The following year, she joined as a full-time student. For the next few decades, Ms. Whelan\u2019s routine was to practice from about 10:30 a.m. to 6 p.m., perform at 8, then do it all again the next day. She had one day off a week, when she would run errands and get a massage.Her schedule left her little time for a family or a social life. \u201cI knew as a kid I didn\u2019t want to have kids,\u201d she says. She lives in New York City with her husband, visual artist David Michalek, whom she married in 2005.Ms. Whelan now focuses on practicing contemporary dance in collaboration with choreographers and other dancers. She appreciates its more fluid style. \u201cI think that it\u2019s good for my body because it asks it to be a little softer,\u201d she says. While she finds contemporary dance just as challenging as ballet, it enables her to make more shapes with her body and \u201cfind more openness within my spine in a different way.\u201d Her goal, she says, \u201cis to find the new channels of movement within.\u201dThese days, she spends her mornings taking a yoga or dance class. She also teaches ballet to advanced high-school students at a Manhattan dance academy. Now that she\u2019s no longer part of a company, she has more control over her schedule. \u201cI can wake up and I can do whatever I want, but I have to decide: Do I want my body to feel good? Or do I want to sit in bed and read?\u201d she says. She\u2019s working on various dance projects, including two performances at the Joyce Theater in New York later this month.Meanwhile, she has been surprised by the number of people outside the world of dance who have responded to the film\u2019s idea of age imposing change. She says, \u201cPeople can relate to the human reality of letting go and losing something, and then re-establishing a part of yourself.\u201dWrite to Alexandra Wolfe at alexandra.wolfe@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-14 08:56:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/dancer-wendy-whelans-next-steps-1500037010", "news_title": "Dancer Wendy Whelan\u2019s Next Steps", "keywords": "aging,ballet,dance,new york city ballet,wendy whelan,political,general news,arts,entertainment"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014Inflation in the U.S. was flat in June.The consumer-price index, which measures what Americans pay for everything from ice cream to eye-doctor visits, was unchanged in June from the prior month, the Labor Department said Friday. Excluding the often-volatile categories of food and energy, so-called core prices rose 0.1%.Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected overall prices to advance 0.1% and core prices to gain 0.2% on the month.From a year earlier, consumer prices climbed only 1.6%, marking the fourth straight month annual gains have eased. Prices were up 1.7% on the year when excluding food and energy.The report is the Federal Reserve\u2019s last peek at a major inflation gauge before officials conclude a two-day policy meeting July 26. The central bank has raised short-term interest rates three times since December but is expected to leave its benchmark unchanged later this month.The Fed is tasked with achieving maximum sustainable employment and stable prices. With unemployment at 4.4% in June, it appears the Fed has closed in on one half of its mandate. Inflation, however, is well shy of its target.The Fed\u2019s preferred inflation gauge, the Commerce Department\u2019s price index for personal-consumption expenditures, poked above the central bank\u2019s 2% goal in February for the first time in nearly five years. It has settled lower each month since. The most recent data, for May, showed a 1.4% year-over-year gain.Low inflation is one reason for the Fed to move cautiously on interest rates, though officials say the phenomenon is likely to fade.\u201dIt\u2019s premature to reach the judgment that we\u2019re not on the path to 2% inflation over the next couple of years,\u201d Chairwoman       Janet Yellen      told lawmakers on Wednesday. \u201cWe\u2019re watching this very closely and stand ready to adjust our policy if it appears that the inflation undershoot will be persistent.\u201dThe consumer-price index tends to run a little bit higher than the personal-consumption index, reflecting different methods for calculating inflation. Both gauges have followed the same pattern, with price gains peaking in February and then easing.In the June CPI report, prices were held in check by falling energy costs. The gasoline index decreased 2.8% from May and was down 0.4% from a year earlier. Food prices held steady last month, and were up 0.9% from a year earlier.Shelter costs\u2014which account for about a third of the overall price index\u2014increased 0.2% on the month and rose 3.3% on the year.A separate Labor Department report showed average weekly earnings for private-sector workers, adjusted for inflation, increased 0.5% in June from the prior month.

The new economy typically refers to those companies that are in the high-technology sector or considered to be environmentally friendly.The bureau didn\u2019t say whether the changes would be reflected in the GDP figures set for release Monday or if they would result in the revision of historical data.Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal expect China\u2019s economy to have grown 6.8% from a year ago in the latest quarter, down slightly from the first quarter\u2019s 6.9% expansion.The NBS said the classification and definitions of certain data sets were also being revised. For example, intellectual property will be broken out as a separate item under nonfinancial assets, while workers\u2019 equity holdings in their employers will be counted as part of their income.The agency said that some of the changes had already been incorporated into its calculations but that others would take more time because of the substantial amount of work required to implement them.The revisions are unlikely to affect next week\u2019s economic data but will probably be reflected over the medium-to-long term, said Yang Zhao, an economist at Nomura Group.\u201cIf, say, under the new framework, it turned out China doesn\u2019t need high growth rates to reach the goal of doubling per capita income by 2020, then it may have some major impacts on policy-making in the future,\u201d he said.\u2014Liyan Qi", "news_time": "2017-07-14 08:34:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-changes-how-it-calculates-gdp-for-first-time-since-2002-1500033669", "news_title": "China Changes How It Calculates GDP for First Time Since 2002 ", "keywords": " change,china, economic data, formula, gdp, revision,regulation,government policy,standards,standardization,corporate,industrial news,economic performance,indicators,economic growth,economic news"}, {"content": "If you are tracking the strength of the U.S. dollar, the bill\u2019s bipolar behavior may be driving you crazy.This month alone, it finished a pessimistic last among major currencies one day, rebounded the next, then slid again Wednesday as investors reacted to testimony by Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen.But short-term variations in the price of the U.S. dollar or other currencies on the foreign exchange market, where participants can buy, sell, exchange or speculate on different currencies, aren\u2019t an indicator of core strength.\u201cLet\u2019s say you have a company like Apple,\u201d said Benjamin Jerry Cohen, a professor of international political economy at the University of California, Santa Barbara. \u201cIts stock market price fluctuates from day to day, but it doesn\u2019t mean the underlying strength of the company is going up and down from day to day.\u201dIt\u2019s the same with the dollar.\u201cTo evaluate the strength of a company, you look at its market share,\u201d Dr. Cohen said. \u201cYou can do the same thing with the dollar. You can look at its market share as an international currency.\u201dAn international currency is a national currency that plays a role in global trade, investments and reserves. In addition to the U.S. dollar, those of consequence are the euro, Japanese yen, British pound, Swiss franc, Australian and Canadian dollars and, increasingly, the Chinese yuan, also known as the renminbi.The currencies\u2019 relative strength can be assessed by examining their shares of global bank reserves, foreign exchange transactions and international debt securities.The U.S. dollar dominates two of the categories and competes with the euro in the third.About 65% of global bank reserves are held in U.S. dollars, according to data collected by the International Monetary Fund, an organization of 189 countries headquartered in Washington, D.C., that facilitates international trade.The next closest is the euro, the official currency of the European Union\u2019s member states, with about 20% of the share. The Japanese yen and British pound trail at 4% or 5%, and the Chinese yuan has a share of about 1%.\u201cIt has been like that for decades,\u201d said Randall Germain, a political economist at Carleton University in Ottawa, Canada. \u201cThe dollar is rock solid.\u201dThe U.S. dollar is also the primary component of foreign exchange transactions, meaning that, globally, it is the most widely used currency, a second measure of underlying strength.Because two currencies are involved in each foreign exchange transaction, the sum of the shares totals 200% instead of 100%.Last year, the U.S. dollar\u2019s share was more than 87% of the 200% total, according to data from the Bank for International Settlements, or BIS, an organization of central banks that is based in Switzerland and whose 60 members represent about 95% of world GDP.The euro was next with 31.4%, followed by the Japanese yen at 21.6%, the British pound at 12.8%, and the Chinese yuan at 4%.\u201cThe dollar is on one side or the other of almost half of all transactions,\u201d Dr. Cohen said, \u201cand its share has not significantly changed over a long period of time.\u201dThe U.S. dollar and the euro together dominate a third category, international debt securities.Around 43% of international bonds, notes and money market instruments were issued in U.S. dollars in the first half of 2015, according to the most recent data available from the BIS. Around 39% were issued in euros, 10% in British pounds and 2% in Japanese yen. Figures for the Chinese yuan weren\u2019t included.By those three measures, the U.S. dollar\u2019s position is solid, but even when its value bounces around in the foreign exchange market, as it has recently, there are winners.Among them are the currency speculators who thrive on such fluctuations.\u201cThe various players, especially financial institutions that do short-term trading, they love this,\u201d said Robert P. Guttmann, an economics professor at Hofstra University on Long Island in New York. \u201cThe worst thing for traders is when the price is stable.\u201dWhen one currency flags, another revives.The U.S. dollar\u2019s recent weakness, Dr. Guttmann said, is a reversal of the Trump bump that followed the U.S. presidential election based on the expectation that a new agenda of tax cuts, deregulation and infrastructure spending would boost the value of the dollar.Instead, the euro gained strength.\u201cThey were looking to get killed, and they actually survived and are doing better,\u201d Dr. Guttmann said of the European Union and its currency, an effecthe attributed in part to the recent election of Emmanuel Macron as president of France.The Trump bump, it appears, was replaced by Macron mania\u2014at least for now.\u201cIn currency markets,\u201d Dr. Guttmann said, \u201cwhat goes up must come down.\u201dWrite to Jo Craven McGinty at Jo.McGinty@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-14 08:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/dollars-gyrations-are-no-cause-for-alarm-1500033600", "news_title": "Dollar\u2019s Gyrations Are No Cause for Alarm ", "keywords": "University of California Santa Barbara,euro zone,currency,economic news,political,general news"}, {"content": "Prospective first-time home buyers are showing more interest in making purchases, despite rising prices and growing anxiety over affordability.Google searches related to buying a first home jumped 11 percentage points to 44% of all home buying-related search activity in 2017 compared with a year earlier, according to a study of Google search data conducted by Chase Home Lending.In all, first-time buyers accounted for 33% of all home sales in May, up from 30% a year earlier, according to the most recent data from the National Association of Realtors.First-time buyers are critical to the market because they bring new demand, allowing homeowners to trade up and stimulating demand for builders to construct new homes.Demand from millennials has been soft because of stagnant wage growth, student loans debt and wariness about the benefits of homeownership.But so far this year, new purchasers accounted for 42% of all buying this year through April, up from 40% in 2016 and 31% during the lowest point during the recent housing cycle in 2011, according to the most recent data from Fannie Mae, which defines first-time buyers as anyone who hasn\u2019t owned a home in the last three years.Some first-time buyers captured by the Fannie Mae data are older, including former spouses who downsize after a divorce or death or people who rented for a period after losing their homes to foreclosure.But by another measure, young people in particular are getting more active in the housing market. Customers under the age of 35 made up 36% of Chase\u2019s mortgage origination volume in 2016, up 16 percentage points from the year before.\u201cI had assumed that we would start to see millennials come in in force in the next two years. They\u2019re already here and buying today,\u201d said       Amy Bonitatibus,        chief marketing officer at Chase Home Lending.Still, affordability, which has been the biggest obstacle to buying a first home for young buyers, remains a critical stumbling block.The number of searches about housing affordability increased 34% in 2016 compared with a year earlier. The top three mortgage-related questions asked on Google were variations on \u201cHow much mortgage can I afford?\u201dThere are indications that while many young people are curious about homeownership they might continue renting for quite some time.

Emmy nominations were released Thursday. Variety writes, \u201cAs Peak TV reaches new heights, it\u2019s only fitting that this year saw a bigger Emmy ballot.\u201d Tied with the most nominations, at 22 each, are NBC\u2019s \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d and HBO\u2019s \u201cWestworld.\u201d Netflix\u2019s huge investment in content appears to be paying off, too: The company notched up 91 nominations in total.The broadcast TV upfront negotiations are mostly wrapped up, and this year, it appears digital\u2019s pains have turned into television\u2019s gains. Analysts estimate prime-time ad commitments are up 3%-4% from last year, as CMO Today supremo Suzanne Vranica reports. The better-than-expected momentum was in part due to some advertisers reallocating their digital spend to TV over concerns about issues such as fraud, viewability and brand safety in the online ad market. And (a more boring reason) advertisers simply decided to make their commitments earlier this year, rather than waiting for the scatter market, when ads are bought closer to the time they air. TV had a part to play, too: There was strong demand for morning news and late-night programming. As always with upfronts numbers, some caveats about what this means for TV ad revenue: 1) Ad buyers and network executives enjoy a bit of spin around the numbers. 2) Advertisers can cancel their commitments. 3) Advertisers with bigger ad commitments may not be increasing their overall spending\u2014they just might be shifting money they usually would have spent later in the year.Roku is expected to launch an IPO before the end of the year, seeking a valuation of around $1 billion, The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Maureen Farrell reports. Roku is in the middle of transforming itself from a business that makes most of its money from manufacturing streaming hardware to one that generates a big proportion of its revenue from ads. Roku says it has 15 million monthly active users and drives about half of over-the-top streaming active usage in any given month in the U.S. It has a couple of elements to its ad business: the ads it sells to promote the apps and content it has on the platform, plus ad-supported channels. Roku\u2019s pitch to investors is likely going to be similar to its pitch to marketers. As more content is made available away from traditional networks and more consumers are cord-cutting, here\u2019s a next-generation TV service that can serve TV-like advertising with more-advanced targeting, ad interactivity and measurement capabilities. Will Wall Street buy it? Blue Apron and Snap have had a rough time on the public markets since their offerings earlier this year, and this could make it tricky to determine the right valuation for Roku, which has significantly fewer users than the likes of Google or Facebook.Speaking of $SNAP, analysts at Stifel have an interesting thesis on why Wall Street is so bearish on its stock, as Markets Insider reports. In a note to clients, Stifel suggested investors are attracted to Twitter because it\u2019s a platform they actually use. But Snapchat, which doesn\u2019t really have a congruous fit with the investor community, is harder for them to understand. Stifel says investors should \u201ctake a step back from their personal preferences and look at the data.\u201d The note points out Snapchat\u2019s numbers are better than some people might think. Downloads in the key advertising demographic are \u201cstable,\u201d and users are spending more than 30 minutes in the app each day, collectively sending more than 3 billion snaps a day. That\u2019s a lot of opportunities for advertising. Fierce rival Instagram appears to be taking notice. Business Insider reports the Facebook-owned photo-sharing app is \u201cluring advertisers onto its platform by giving them free trials and credits.\u201d It\u2019s a strategy digital ad platforms (including Snapchat) have used for a while to incentivize ad buyers to try new products, but one agency source said that this time around, they think it\u2019s a \u201cconscious effort\u201d from Instagram to strike while Snapchat is on the receiving end of negative headlines.There\u2019s a new cohort of \u201cunconventional\u201d strategic investors in digital ad agencies. No, not consultancies\u2014that\u2019s old news. Move on. AdAge reports a large number of brands snapped up agencies in the first half of this year, according to marketing consultancy R3. Some examples from the report: Domino\u2019s bought digital publishing and communications agency IPG Connect for $6 million; Indiegogo acquired innovation shop Agency of Trillions for $10 million; Shiseido spent $11 million on creative agency Dwalk; and Yelp forked out $20 million on Turnstyle Analytics.

Grab launched in 2012 and operates in 65 cities across seven countries.\u201cWe will not be commenting on any market rumors or speculation,\u201d a Grab spokeswoman said. A SoftBank spokesman declined to comment, as did a Didi spokeswoman.Uber has spent billions of dollars to expand to more than 70 countries, fighting competitors with local ties and deep pockets along the way. Last year Uber sold its China unit to Didi in exchange for a 20% Didi stake and the promise of a $1 billion investment, the companies said at the time. On Thursday, Uber said it is combining its operations in Russia with Yandex.Taxi, the country\u2019s most popular ride-hailing firm.Uber faces challenges at home too, with a string of executive departures in the wake of an investigation into sexual harassment and sexism at the company. Last month, co-founder Travis Kalanick relinquished his role as Uber\u2019s chief executive, although he remains a director.Grab, whose previous investors include venture fund GGV Capital and Chinese investment fund Hillhouse Capital Group, most recently announced a funding round last year, when it raised $750 million in a round led by SoftBank.Neither Grab nor Uber discloses user numbers, but Grab\u2019s app is more popular than Uber\u2019s in many Southeast Asian markets, according to mobile-app analytics firm App Annie. Grab offers private-car, taxi, motorcycle, and carpool bookings in more cities throughout Southeast Asia than Uber.In contrast to Uber, which has tangled with regulators and taxi unions globally, Grab has said it works closely with authorities and even has partnerships with local taxi companies. It has recently expanded to offer mobile payments.It isn\u2019t a two-horse race. In Indonesia, Grab and Uber face a fast-growing local startup called GoJek, which specializes in motorcycle taxis and has expanded to include food and package deliveries, cleaning services and more.Southeast Asia\u2019s ride-hailing market could grow to $13.1 billion by 2025\u2014from $2.5 billion in 2015\u2014according to a report last year by             Alphabet Inc.\u2019s       Google and Singapore state-investment firm Temasek Holdings.Write to Liza Lin at Liza.Lin@wsj.com, Julie Steinberg at julie.steinberg@wsj.com and Newley Purnell at newley.purnell @wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-14 07:40:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/uber-rival-grab-in-talks-for-up-to-2-billion-from-softbank-chinas-didi-1500032435", "news_title": "Uber Rival Grab in Talks for Up to $2 Billion from SoftBank, China\u2019s Didi ", "keywords": "corporate funding,fundraising,grab,ride-hailing apps,ride-hailing services,vc new money,venture capital,GrabTaxi Holdings,SoftBank Group,9984.TO,JP:9984,Uber Technologies,Didi Chuxing Technology,corporate,industrial news,private equity,venture funding,retail,wholesale,etailing,diversified holding companies,business,consumer services,e-commerce,online service providers,technology,sharing economy services"}, {"content": "HONG KONG\u2014Four pro-democracy lawmakers were disqualified from office after a court ruled they failed to properly execute their oaths, dealing a heavy blow to the stuttering Hong Kong movement opposed to Beijing\u2019s tightening control over the city.The ousters mean the opposition camp risks losing the number of legislators it needs to veto legislation. The ruling comes as the city\u2019s new leader,       Carrie Lam,        faces pressure from Beijing to propose controversial laws against sedition and to introduce patriotic Chinese education in schools. Previous attempts to push through such legislation were abandoned after mass protests.A total of six legislators have been disqualified by the High Court after their controversial oaths at the swearing-in ceremony in October last year. The disqualifications followed a decision by Beijing to interpret the city\u2019s mini-constitution, requiring elected politicians to solemnly swear allegiance to the city as part of China.The intervention prompted an outcry from opposition leaders who accused Beijing of undermining the city\u2019s rule of law. Judicial independence and freedom of speech are protected in Hong Kong until 2047 under the handover agreement between China and the U.K.City authorities are aggressively using legal action against political dissenters, bringing criminal prosecutions over illegal gatherings and civil cases to disqualify lawmakers. On July 1, China\u2019s President Xi Jinping issued a stern warning against political agitation during a visit to mark 20 years since Hong Kong\u2019s return to Chinese rule from Britain. Mr. Xi called any Hong Kong challenges to central government power \u201cimpermissible\u201d acts that cross a \u201cred line.\u201dAmong those ousted Friday were veteran activist lawmaker       Leung Kwok-hung       and the city\u2019s youngest member of the Legislative Council,       Nathan Law,        who was one of the student leaders of street protests that paralyzed parts of the city for weeks in late 2014.The lawmakers were challenged by the government over their oath-taking on Oct. 12 last year, because some added their own words to the oath, while others read it slowly or spoke in a tone of voice considered derogatory when saying the word China.Justice       Thomas Au       said in his judgment that the lawmakers didn\u2019t show genuine intention to commit to and abide by the obligations of the oath. He also rejected their claims that the proceedings brought by the government were an abuse of process, adding that the assertions that the government was \u201cpolitically motivated\u201d in bringing the case to court was \u201cat best speculative.\u201dMr. Leung, known locally as \u201cLong Hair,\u201d said the court ruling effectively altered the Legislative Council election results last September, giving the pro-establishment camp an upper hand in controlling the parliament. At the elections, the pro-democracy camp won a majority among the 35 geographically based seats, and retained a third of the mostly pro-Beijing chamber\u2019s 70 seats, giving the bloc its veto power.Demosisto, the political party that Mr. Law represents, said Beijing was trying to manipulate Hong Kong\u2019s legislature at the expense of voters who had elected the four lawmakers, but vowed to continue fighting for democracy and universal suffrage.Dozens of people protested outside the court, faced off against lines of police. Another group of pro-Beijing supporters waved the national flags, lambasting the ousted lawmakers and other pro-democracy activists.The four disqualified lawmakers can appeal the ruling. Special elections will need to be held for the vacant seats, likely to prove a litmus test of how strong public support remains for the pro-democracy groups.Correction  The secondary photo accompanying this article was taken March 1.

Divergence is dead, and convergence is in the cards. Such transitions are when things start to get tricky.The turn in the tide at central banks\u2014whether it be the European Central Bank charting a path to reducing bond purchases, the Federal Reserve preparing to rein in its balance sheet, the Bank of Japan\u2019s stealth tapering, the Bank of England talking of a rate rise or the Bank of Canada actually raising rates for the first time in seven years\u2014has led to speculation about coordinated action. The idea that a secret cabal of central bankers have conspired to work together was dismissed recently by ECB executive board member Peter Praet.The more likely explanation is simply that central banks are reacting to a global economy moving in the same direction for the first time in years. After a decade of crisis-fighting policy, there is no obvious crisis to fight. Output gaps are closing, and economic volatility is low. The threat of deflation has faded. Inflation is below target in many countries, with the exception of the U.K. But central bankers are generally making the argument that softness in headline measures is transitory, with growth holding up and labor markets tightening.That shift matters for markets. It tips the balance for future policy actions: economic data would need to deteriorate persistently for a change in tone. And it allows room for central bankers to consider other risks, in particular the steep rise in asset prices that their policies have engendered and which may yet pose a threat to financial stability.The question is whether markets have taken that on board. This week\u2019s action highlights that. First, markets put a dovish spin, perhaps unwarrantedly, on Fed Chairwoman       Janet Yellen\u2019s       testimony Wednesday and the \u201ceverything rally\u201d resumed: prices for stocks, bonds and gold all rose. But to the extent that markets ease financial conditions, they may actually encourage central bankers to tighten policy. Bonds fell back Thursday after The Wall Street Journal reported ECB President Mario Draghi could signal a shift in policy at the Fed\u2019s Jackson Hole conference in August.Clouding the picture, markets could yet do some of the tightening for central banks, particularly when it comes to currencies. For instance, the ECB may have a problem if the euro charges higher, as a 10% rise in the trade-weighted exchange rate could shave 0.5 percentage point off inflation, notes Lombard Street Research. No wonder the Fed and the ECB are eager to talk about how they will move gradually. The risk to markets is that investors get too comfortable with this idea.This push-and-pull seems likely to lead to higher volatility. Central bankers have for a long time been investors\u2019 best friends. Now the relationship is a lot more complicated.Write to Richard Barley at richard.barley@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-14 07:14:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-to-prepare-when-central-banks-all-row-in-the-same-direction-1500030712", "news_title": "How to Prepare When Central Banks All Row in the Same Direction", "keywords": " central banks, inflation, janet yellen,mario draghi, monetary easing, monetary policy,European Central Bank,Federal Reserve,monetary policy,central bank intervention,economic news,commodity,financial market news"}, {"content": "BEIJING\u2014Nearly three decades after a bloody military assault ended student demonstrations in Tiananmen Square, China\u2019s democracy movement faces a new reckoning.The loss of the country\u2019s most prominent dissident, Nobel Peace Prize winner       Liu Xiaobo,        who died of cancer under police guard at a Shenyang hospital on Thursday, leaves China\u2019s fractured activist community at its weakest in a generation as the Communist Party tightens its grip on Chinese society.A steady shrinking of space for political action that began in late 2008, with the arrest of Mr. Liu for helping to draft and promote a pro-democracy manifesto, has intensified significantly under President       Xi Jinping.As Mr. Liu and other activists have disappeared behind bars, lawyers and legal workers who had picked up the torch have faced mass detentions. Some are still in prison. Labor-rights campaigners have been detained, and popular critical voices on China\u2019s social media have been silenced.Two days after the death of Mr. Liu, Chinese political-reform advocates hope to welcome the release from prison of Xu Zhiyong, a legal scholar some consider Mr. Liu\u2019s successor as head of the threadbare movement.The founder of a loosely organized civic group known as the New Citizens Movement was detained in 2013 for organizing protests over corruption and access to education. Even if he is let out on Saturday as scheduled, he is likely to be under watch by security agents and his activities curtailed.\u201cUnder the current circumstances, you can\u2019t assume he\u2019ll be free,\u201d said an associate of Mr. Xu who said police have warned him against talking publicly about the scholar.The Beijing Municipal Bureau of Justice didn\u2019t immediately respond to request for comment about Mr. Xu\u2019s release.China\u2019s government, which rejects Western democracy as unsuited for the country, has depicted human-rights lawyers and activists as tools of foreign governments threatened by China\u2019s rise.The ground has shifted so much since Mr. Xi\u2019s crackdown began that some veteran members of the democracy movement say they don\u2019t know how to move forward.\u201cIt\u2019s been 28 years since the \u201889 democracy movement. That\u2019s an entire generation,\u201d said       Liu Suli,        a Tiananmen participant and founder of an independent bookstore in Beijing who befriended Liu Xiaobo in prison in 1989. Over the years, he said, the Communist Party has grown both more confident on the world stage and more fearful of instability at home.\u201cUnder these conditions, if you play the political game using traditional methods, you\u2019ll lose,\u201d he said.Such attitudes are a far cry from 2010, the year Liu Xiaobo was awarded his Nobel. Chinese activists saw the award as a signal of international support and vindication. Some portrayed Mr. Liu as a Mandela-like figure who would emerge from his 11-year prison sentence to take the reins of a new, multiparty China.Instead, China moved in the opposite direction. Mr. Liu\u2019s name was erased from the internet by government censors and his family members were muzzled. Activists who had been criticized by others in the movement for being too moderate suddenly found themselves in prison.That was the case with Mr. Xu. A former visiting scholar at Yale University, he stopped short of Mr. Liu\u2019s calls for a complete overhaul of China\u2019s political system. Instead, he organized protests and dinner discussions aimed at cultivating a \u201ccitizen consciousness,\u201d which he believed could be used to pressure the Communist Party to abide by China\u2019s constitution, which guarantees freedom of speech and assembly.Mr. Xu and more than a dozen other activists affiliated with the New Citizens Movement were arrested in the first half of 2013 in Mr. Xi\u2019s first major strike against dissent. Lawyers, scholars, writers and women\u2019s-rights activists were detained over the following years, some of them shown confessing to crimes in jailhouse videos broadcast on state TV.\u201cRights defenders under Xi Jinping are regarded as enemies of the state,\u201d says       Eva Pils,        a researcher of China human-rights issues at King\u2019s College London. Where once Chinese officials were more circumspect about punishing critics, she says, now \u201cthey are very open about how they target the people who express dissent.\u201dSome activists in China\u2019s democracy movement blame their predicament partly on withering support from Western countries afraid to confront Beijing over human-rights abuses, given China\u2019s growing economic sway.Several countries urged China to let Mr. Liu seek treatment abroad, but few leaders publicly voiced such requests during his final days.\u201cI think it\u2019s shocking how few heads of state have weighed in on behalf of a Nobel Peace Prize winner,\u201d said Sophie Richardson, China director at Human Rights Watch.The hopes of many Chinese democracy advocates have shifted in recent years to Hong Kong. However, the city has increasingly felt the presence of the Chinese security apparatus, including with the abduction of employees of a Hong Kong store selling books critical of China\u2019s leaders.\u201cIf they think China\u2019s human-rights abuses stay inside China\u2019s borders, they have not been paying attention,\u201d Ms. Richardson said of the silence of foreign leaders.After Mr. Liu\u2019s death, hundreds of people gathered outside the Chinese government\u2019s Liaison Office in Hong Kong. Passersby laid flowers and signed a condolence book underneath a makeshift altar with a large photograph of him.With eyes now on whether Mr. Xu can play a unifying role, the experiences of others in the New Citizens Movement suggest it will be a struggle.Zhang Kun,        an activist who helped Mr. Xu organize dinners, has been jailed multiple times since his first detention in 2014. He has been unreachable since March. Several other supporters of Mr. Xu, including       Wang Gongquan,        a venture capitalist who helped fund the movement, have refrained from political activity after being released from detention.\u201cI hope Zhiyong recovers his health, and enthusiastically sets about creating a new life for himself,\u201d said Mr. Wang, who is currently working on a travel startup.Some activist groups have switched tactics, said       Teng Biao,        a lawyer who along with Mr. Xu helped launch the rights-defense movement among Chinese lawyers.\u201cEveryone has adopted the approach of activities without centralized leadership,\u201d said Mr. Teng, who is now based in New York.Last Sunday marked the second anniversary of one of the Xi administration\u2019s most aggressive moves: a nationwide sweep of human-rights lawyers and their associates in which hundreds were interrogated, jailed and, in some cases, tortured. The only large event to commemorate the date was held in New York, organized by lawyers living in de facto exile in the U.S.\u2014Li Yuan and       Charles Rollet       contributed to this article.Write to Josh Chin at josh.chin@wsj.com and Eva Dou at eva.dou@wsj.comAppeared in the July 15, 2017, print edition as 'Dream of Chinese Democracy Flickers.'", "news_time": "2017-07-14 06:33:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/after-liu-xiaobos-death-chinese-democracy-dream-fights-for-survival-1500028406", "news_title": "After Liu Xiaobo\u2019s Death, Chinese Democracy Dream Fights for Survival", "keywords": " china, democracry, human rights,liu xiaobo, tiananmen, xi jinping,Xi Jinping,Liu Xiaobo,political,general news,society,community,crime,legal action,human rights,civil liberties,politics,international relations,domestic politics,obituaries,routine general news"}, {"content": "Sign up: With one click, get this newsletter delivered to your inbox.DryShips Inc.\u2019s        DRYS -39.84%       most notable achievements lately have come far from the company\u2019s maritime bulk transport business. DryShips has doubled its assets in six months while watching its stock price fall 99.9%, taking what the WSJ\u2019s Spencer Jakab writes is one of the wildest rides in recent stock-market history. The company has executed a series of reverse stock splits, caused half a billion dollars of traders\u2019 money to vanish and, it appears, made two wealthy men wealthier, all while navigating the shipping operation through sharp swings in its business hauling bulk commodities. The maneuvers were launched under arrangements with a British Virgin Islands firm, Kalani Investments Ltd., which has pushed a plan to help companies in the troubled bulk business raise money by buying new shares directly from the companies at a discount. While DryShips chief       George Economou       and Kalani leader Marc Bistricer appear to have profited, and the carrier has funded new investments, the holdings of longstanding shareholders have crumbled in value.China is preparing to take a bigger role in world-wide logistics business. The majority owners of Singapore\u2019s             Global Logistic Properties Ltd.       chose a consortium led by two Chinese investment funds as the preferred bidder for control of one of the world\u2019s largest operators of warehouses. The WSJ\u2019s Jake Maxwell Watts reports the group led by China\u2019s Hillhouse Capital Group and Hopu Investment Management Co. and by GLP\u2019s current chief executive will buy the business in a deal worth $11.6 billion, beating out efforts by U.S. private-equity giants Warburg Pincus LLC and             Blackstone Group                   LP. The purchase comes as China is raising its profile in global supply chains. State-owned Cosco Shipping Holdings Co.\u2019s move this week to buy rival Orient Overseas (International) Ltd. will vault the business into the top three of the world\u2019s container shipping operators. GLP is only about half the size of U.S.-based             Prologis Inc.       in the warehouse market, but it holds properties in key global markets, including a big portfolio in Asia.China\u2019s expanding role in global supply chains comes as the country is pushing goods through distribution channels. The country\u2019s exports and imports both came in higher than expected in June, the WSJ\u2019s Grace Zhu and Liyan Qi report, reflecting resilience in the world\u2019s second-largest economy and strengthening demand from Western markets. China\u2019s exports rose 11.3% in June from a year earlier, the fourth straight month of gains, and a likely signal of accelerating flows into North American and European ports. China\u2019s trade data is closely watched as a barometer of strength in global trade. Although exports have become a less important factor in China\u2019s own growth as Beijing has moved to make the country more reliant on domestic consumption, the outbound flows remain a good signal of global demand for goods. Production appears to be scaling up: the 17.2% growth in imports last month includes the raw materials that feed China\u2019s industrial expansion.Trucker Celadon Group Inc. is swapping leaders in a new bid for financial stability.Paul Svindland, who has specialized in turning businesses around as both a trucking executive and consultant, will replace Chief Executive       Paul Will       this month, as the company tries to get in shape to take advantage of an improving trucking market. Mr. Svindland tells WSJ Logistics Report\u2019s Jennifer Smith that he\u2019ll focus first on bringing more discipline to             Celadon\u2019s       asset-based truckload business.

Respondents also\u00a0could assign probability to someone not on the list.\u00a0The survey results were an average of their responses, although not every economist submitted estimates or comments for the question.Bernard Baumohl of the Economic Outlook Group viewed Ms. Yellen\u2019s chances for reappointment\u00a0as favorable, placing a 40%\u00a0probability on her renomination,\u00a0\u201cbecause her cautious approach to monetary policy has been good for the stock market.\u201dMs. Yellen has said on numerous occasions that she intends to serve out her current term as chairwoman. When asked if she would accept a request from the president to nominate her for another term during testimony Wednesday, Ms. Yellen told the House Financial Services Committee that the matter of a renomination has \u201cnot been something that\u2019s come up,\u201d but she is prepared to discuss it with the president.In separate testimony to the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday, Ms. Yellen said she hasn\u2019t decided whether she would accept renomination if offered it.The economists polled assigned some uncertainty to the overall nomination process in their comments, citing the unpredictable nature of the Trump White House so far.\u201cWho can read President Trump\u2019s mind?,\u201d said       James Smith,        chief economist at Parsec Financial.\u201cSurprise appointments have been Trump\u2019s hallmark,\u201d       Joel Naroff       of Naroff Economic Advisors said.Further down on the list of potential nominees, with an average 6.5% probability of being chosen, was Columbia University Professor       Glenn Hubbard,        who was chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President       George W. Bush.       Fed governor       Jerome Powell       garnered 5.6%, while former Dallas Fed President       Richard Fisher       got 4.8%.The respondents put a 3.9% probability on       Kevin Hassett,        current chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, and at 3.2%.             J.P. Morgan Chase                   & Co. Chief       James Dimon.One wild-card name on the list was Bank of England Gov.       Mark Carney,        a Canadian who previously ran the Bank of Canada. His term as head of the British central bank doesn\u2019t end until June\u00a030, 2019, however, more than a year after Ms. Yellen\u2019s term as chairwoman expires.

GBTZY 0.94%      , in what would be the biggest deal ever recorded in Southeast Asia.The deal will value the Singapore-listed firm at about 16 billion Singapore dollars (US$11.6 billion), excluding debt. It would top a 2008 telecommunications deal in Malaysia that was worth about US$7.9 billion, excluding debt, according to data provider Dealogic.The consortium, which includes GLP\u2019s chief executive as well as Chinese investors Hillhouse Capital Group and Hopu Investment Management Co., will pay 3.38 Singapore dollars a share for the warehousing firm, GLP said in a statement Friday.The group was chosen by GLP\u2019s board over several other potential investors including Warburg Pincus LLC and             Blackstone Group        BX 0.78%       LP, which both sought to bid for GLP.The offer was more than 25% higher than GLP\u2019s last traded price of S$2.70 a share before the stock was halted Thursday morning. GLP shares have risen sharply since the beginning of the year, when its largest shareholder, Singapore sovereign-wealth fund GIC Pte Ltd., said it asked for a strategic review of GLP\u2019s options.GIC, which owns 37% of GLP, has committed to vote in favor of the deal, according to stock-exchange filings, though it has wiggle room to accept a competing offer if one is made.To proceed, the deal must receive approvals both from shareholders and the Singapore courts, which GLP said it would request.In a statement, Global Logistic Properties Chairman Seek Ngee Huat said the company chose the Chinese-backed consortium because it believed the offer was \u201ccompelling and value-enhancing for all shareholders.\u201dChinese regulators in recent months have carefully eyed big purchases abroad and sought to limit capital leaving the country. However, the funding for the deal will come from outside China, which helped enhance the offer, said a person familiar with the matter.The deal will include debt financing of just less than US$5 billion, people familiar with the matter said.             Citigroup Inc.       and             Goldman Sachs Group Inc.       are arranging the debt financing. Citigroup,             Morgan Stanley                   and Goldman Sachs advised the consortium on the deal.GLP, whose customers include             Amazon.com Inc.       and DHL Worldwide Express Inc., is a major player in the booming business of storing and moving goods from suppliers to consumers. It manages nearly US$40 billion in logistics assets\u2014a bit more than half the amount that No. 1 warehouse owner             Prologis Inc.       of the U.S. does.

But this time many of them are buying at home\u2014and on their smartphones.Luxury sales in China have picked up since the beginning of the year, underpinned by easy credit and a booming property market. The weaker yuan has also encouraged the Chinese to spend at home rather than on foreign shopping sprees. Bain & Co. expects luxury sales to grow 6% to 8% in mainland China this year.Luxury brands suffered in late 2015 and 2016, after China\u2019s anticorruption drive and currency devaluation hit sales.       Luca Solca       of Exane BNP Paribas estimates that between 70% and 80% of the sector\u2019s recent rebound in growth has been driven by Chinese spenders.One pocket of success: web-savvy Chinese consumers. According to Deloitte, 13.5% of China\u2019s overall retail sales are online, much higher than global average of 8.6%. Gucci launched an online shop there this month.             Burberry        BURBY -0.09%       and Longchamp have also started selling handbags through WeChat, China\u2019s largest social media platform. Burberry\u2019s online direct sales to consumers in China doubled year over year last quarter, thanks to its marketing campaign on             WeChat.Makers of luxury goods have hesitated to go online, fearing it could cheapen their brands. Fakes in China make the problem worse, a complaint made by many retailers against China\u2019s dominant e-commerce marketplaces run by Alibaba.WeChat, a messenger app and social media portal that allows brands to directly send messages to users who follow them seems an ideal tool for marketing and sales, since the brands maintain control of the sales process. Users buy directly from their online shops without leaving the app. It is still early, but this is an important first step for Tencent, which owns WeChat, to challenge Alibaba\u2019s dominance in China\u2019s e-commerce market.Other incumbents are eyeing the opportunity, too. China\u2019s second-biggest e-commerce firm after Alibaba,             JD.com,       invested $397 million into London-based Farfetch, an online marketplace for luxury goods. Alibaba has also made efforts to reduce fakes on its websites. The number of product listings for \u201cArmani Men,\u201d for example, has dropped 86% on Taobao over the past year, according to consultancy L2\u2014indicating fewer merchants putting up fakes on the site.Alibaba could go further and buy into a specialist platform of its own. The stock price of Milan-listed             Yoox                   Net-a-Porter, the largest online marketplace for luxury, has risen 9% since news of JD.com\u2019s investment, probably exacerbated by a short-squeeze. Paris-listed             LVMH,       the world\u2019s largest luxury group, last month launched its own multibrand website, 24sevres.com.Luxury stocks, such as LVMH, Richemont and Burberry have recovered smartly thanks to China. But they are also getting full credit for the rebound, trading near the top of their historical valuation ranges, above 20 times forecast earnings, according to FactSet.Being big in China is important for luxury brands. But being online in China seems more important at the moment.Write to Jacky Wong at jacky.wong@wsj.com and Stephen Wilmot at stephen.wilmot@wsj.comAppeared in the July 15, 2017, print edition as 'Luxury Goods Are Selling Again, on Chinese Smartphones.'", "news_time": "2017-07-14 05:42:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/luxury-goods-are-selling-again-on-chinese-smartphones-1500025322", "news_title": "Luxury Goods Are Selling Again\u2014On Chinese Smartphones ", "keywords": " alibaba,china, china online, chinese consumers, chinese retail, luxury goods,Burberry,BRBY.LN,Bain,Alibaba Group Holding,BABA,Tencent Holdings,HK:0700,Cie.

It took effect in 2013, and this year it is expected to bring in nearly $30 billion, according to the Tax Policy Center. Republicans in the House of Representatives have voted to repeal the tax, retroactive to\u00a0Jan. 1, but those in the Senate surprised many recently when they\u00a0revealed plans to keep it.This levy was billed as a tax on the richest, and often it is: More than three-quarters of its revenue comes from households earning more than $1 million. In 2017, these households will owe an average of about $37,000 each due to this tax, while those earning between $200,000 and $500,000 will owe an average of about $200 each.The averages conceal wide variations, however. The 3.8% surtax can reach far beyond the wealthy, if taxpayers have an investment windfall. And its reach is expanding, because the trigger points aren\u2019t adjusted for inflation.Often the tax \u201capplies to taxpayers who aren\u2019t expecting it, and who could have lowered it with planning,\u201d says       Ken Rubin,        a certified public accountant with RubinBrown LLP in St. Louis.Here is how the tax works. A flat surtax of 3.8% applies to net investment income of most married couples who have more than $250,000 of adjusted gross income (AGI). For most single filers, the threshold is $200,000.The 3.8% levy applies only to the investment income above the threshold for single/married filers. For example, a single person with $180,000 of income doesn\u2019t owe any surtax\u2014even if all that income is from investments.But say this person then reaps a one-time gain of $100,000 from selling long-held shares\u2014as happened to a client of Mr. Rubin. Then her income jumps to $280,000, and $80,000 of it will be subject to the 3.8% surtax. Total extra tax: $3,040.What counts as investment income? Interest; dividends; most capital gains; certain rental and royalty income; and certain passive investment income, such as from limited partnerships.What\u2019s not investment income?\u00a0In general, income from municipal bonds, and income from investments in partnerships or S corporations, if the recipient \u201cactively\u201d participates as defined by law. There are also exceptions for certain types of rental income and certain capital gains, such as from the sale of a business run by the owner.High earners may not be able to avoid the 3.8% surtax, but others can often minimize it through planning. For those worried about the tax, here are some tips:\u2022Don\u2019t worry about most home sales.\u00a0A tax break allows most couples selling a primary residence to skip tax on up to $500,000 of profit ($250,000 for singles). Few home sellers have gains greater than this. Those that do should take note of the 3.8% tax.\u2022Harvest losses.\u00a0The 3.8% surtax is on\u00a0net\u00a0investment income. One of the tax code\u2019s great benefits is that losses from one investment can offset gains from another.\u2022Minimize AGI. Reducing AGI, the number at the bottom of the front page of the Form 1040, can trim the 3.8% tax.Ways to lower AGI include: making deductible contributions to tax-favored retirement plans, such as 401(k)s or pensions; making charitable contributions from IRA assets, if you\u2019re older than 70\u00bd; taking a capital loss up to $3,000; and deducting moving expenses.\u2022Know how retirement-account income hurts\u2014and helps. Taxable payments from pensions, traditional IRAs and Social Security aren\u2019t themselves subject to the 3.8% surtax\u2014but they can swell income in a way that exposes investment income to it.For example, a couple with $260,000 of income from taxable IRAs, Social Security and pensions wouldn\u2019t owe the 3.8% tax. But if $20,000 of their income is instead from dividends and capital gains, then they would owe the 3.8% surtax on $10,000\u2014because that is the amount of investment income above $250,000.On the other hand, tax-free payouts from Roth IRAs don\u2019t raise taxable income and can help minimize the 3.8% surtax.\u2022Hold until death.\u00a0As with the capital-gains tax, the 3.8% surtax doesn\u2019t apply to profits on investments held until death.Write to Laura Saunders at laura.saunders@wsj.comAppeared in the July 15, 2017, print edition as 'Some Tips to Reduce the Health-Care Surtax.'", "news_time": "2017-07-14 05:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/what-the-senates-3-8-surtax-means-for-american-taxpayers-1500024603", "news_title": "What the Senate\u2019s 3.8% Surtax Means for American Taxpayers ", "keywords": "RubinBrown,Ken Rubin,government finance,government budget,taxation,economic news,political,general news,personal finance,politics,international relations,domestic politics,tax strategies,government bodies,legislative branch,upper house,advice"}, {"content": "CSX Corp.\u2019s        CSX -5.07%       new boss has nixed naptime.Hunter Harrison joined the railway as chief executive in March, promising to quickly jolt the company\u2019s culture and bring on tighter schedules, faster trains and less downtime.One casualty of the new plan: napping breaks, which train conductors and engineers were allowed for up to 45 minutes under a strict protocol when trains were stopped. Now, any on-the-job shut-eye is forbidden.\u201cWe had a rule that said you could take a nap while you worked,\u201d Mr. Harrison said in a recent interview. \u201cWe don\u2019t have that now.\u201dThe change, instituted by the 72-year-old railroad veteran in a half-page bulletin in April, eliminated more than two decades of allowable naps on CSX trains. It also put CSX at odds with its U.S. rivals. BNSF Railway Co., Kansas City Southern Corp.,             Norfolk Southern Corp.       and             Union Pacific Corp.      , allow napping under certain conditions, as do hundreds of other smaller railways.The two other railways that Mr. Harrison ran\u2014Canadian National and             Canadian Pacific                  \u2014don\u2019t allow napping.\u201cWe think it\u2019s pertinent and appropriate in certain circumstances to enable an employee to nap,\u201d said Union Pacific CEO       Lance Fritz.       The railway has allowed naps since 1999 and has even built \u201cnap rooms\u201d at various sites to facilitate rest.The various changes that Mr. Harrison is implementing are meant to give employees less variability in their schedules, allowing them to plan their sleep better, CSX spokesman Rob Doolittle said. CSX believes employees are safer \u201cwhen they are fully engaged in the activity around them at all times when they are on duty,\u201d he said, adding that worker safety hasn\u2019t slipped since the rule changed in April.According to the General Code of Operating Rules, napping is permitted by U.S. freight trains:Frequent delays hauling freight provide plenty of opportunities for napping. On long routes, a train may be shunted to a \u201csiding\u201d to allow another to pass from the opposite direction. With dozens of miles between sidings and long trains chugging along at about 25 miles an hour, such delays can easily last more than an hour. Track repairs, derailments and congestion can also lead to long waits.Fatigue is an issue too in what is a 24/7 operation in which engineers can be called into work in the middle of the night. Federal laws regulate railroad shifts, including a maximum of 12 hours worked in a 24-hour period and 10 hours off before resuming work. Still, the National Transportation Safety Board says nearly 20% of investigations of railway accidents between 2001 and 2012 identified fatigue as a cause or contributing factor.A Union Pacific spokeswoman cited a National Aeronautics and Space Administration study of airline pilots that showed a planned, 40-minute nap taken in-flight made them 34% more aware and 100% more alert.Fatigue is a common issue in other industries\u2014such as aviation and medicine\u2014that are staffed round the clock, and often workers are encouraged to nap to keep alert.             United Parcel Service Inc.,       for one, has 125 sleep rooms at its main hub in Louisville, Ky., where pilots can recharge between flights.\u201cIf there was an opportunity to take a nap, 90% of the time someone in the cab was going to want to do it,\u201d said John Paul Wright, a retired CSX locomotive engineer who currently organizes for Railroad Workers United, a coalition of unions. He recalls spending three hours waiting outside terminals in Nashville, Tenn., without moving. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s 12-noon or 12-midnight, someone is going to kick their feet up and nap for a minute.\u201dJohn Risch, national legislative director for the International Association of Sheet Metal, Air, Rail and Transportation Workers, a union that represents CSX conductors, said that napping is a key way to deal with fatigue. \u201cEliminating napping is a real disappointment and the wrong way to go,\u201d he said.While union contracts govern pay, benefits and other quality-of-life issues, rules on operational procedures\u2014which have a long history in the railroad industry\u2014remain within the purview of railway management.Waiting is anathema to Mr. Harrison, who is busy at CSX implementing an approach he calls precision railroading. The goal is running trains on a tighter schedule and keeping them moving along. Less than four months into his tenure, CSX\u2019s trains are moving 10% faster and spending 7% less time in terminals.Some staff view the nap prohibition as another way for CSX management to put the screws on workers, who are monitored constantly on inward-facing cameras in cabs. \u201cIf you\u2019re sitting in a siding somewhere and you fall asleep out in the middle of nowhere, what\u2019s the issue with that?\u201d a current CSX employee said.CSX says it uses a progressive scale to address noncompliant behavior, \u201cranging from informal coaching to termination.\u201dSection 111 of CSX\u2019s rule book detailed the now-obsolete napping protocol, which prohibited sleep if the train was moving or any crew was on the ground. Only one crew member could nap at any time, while another had to remain at the controls. The maximum nap time was 45 minutes.Norfolk Southern, which like CSX operates in the eastern U.S., continues make allowance for naps in its operating rules. \u201cThe policy has a positive effect on safety and no effect on productivity,\u201d       Susan Terpay,        a spokeswoman, said.Canadian Pacific said it prohibits naps because operating crews always have safety-related duties to perform, and expects employees to rest during their time off. \u201cCP believes fatigue management is a shared responsibility between the railroad and the employee,\u201d said       Martin Cej,        a spokesman for the railway.Railroaders are left with few things to do when trains are delayed. Distractions like smartphones, magazines, books or games aren\u2019t allowed. One thing they can do to pass the time, said Mr. Wright, the retired engineer: \u201cRead the operating rules.\u201d\u2014David George-Cosh contributed to this article.Write to Paul Ziobro at Paul.Ziobro@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-14 05:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/no-more-naps-on-the-railroad-says-new-csx-boss-1500024602", "news_title": "No More Napping on the Railroad, Says New CSX Boss ", "keywords": "BNSF Railway,CSX,United Parcel Service,UPS,Kansas City Southern,Canadian Pacific,CP.T,CP,Norfolk Southern,NSC,Union Pacific,UNP,Mr. Harrison,management,management moves,labor,personnel,corporate,industrial news,labor disputes,heavy construction,railway construction,railroads,freight transport,logistics,construction,real estate,road,rail transport,railroad freight,transportation"}, {"content": "HELSINKI\u2014Russia is planning its biggest military exercise in years, and its neighbor Finland is going underground.A subterranean city beneath Helsinki forms a crucial line of defense for the capital.

The law would also extend to federal police the ability given to the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation to remotely monitor computer networks and devices with a warrant.The country\u2019s police and spy agency can already apply for a warrant to intercept online text and voice messages. But they often have no easy way to read or listen to them if they have been encrypted by a messaging application such as Wickr, Telegram Messenger and             Facebook Inc.\u2019s       WhatsApp. The legislation seeks to update laws enacted before the advent of social media and other platforms but would stop short of ordering companies to install specific technology that would give law-enforcement agencies backdoor access to messages.A spokeswoman for Facebook said the company has a protocol for responding to requests from law enforcement. \u201cWeakening encrypted systems for them would mean weakening it for everyone,\u201d she said.On its website, Facebook said it had produced data for Australian law-enforcement agencies in response to more than 60% of the 657 requests it received in the second half of last year.Apple Inc.       declined to comment on the planned law. On its website the company said that in the second half of 2016, it received more than 2,500 requests from Australian government agencies for details on Apple devices or connections and agreed to provide data in 87% of cases.Tackling encryption has been a plank in Prime Minister       Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s       government\u2019s efforts to cut off terrorism, including establishing a mandatory data-retention program.\u201cWe cannot allow the internet to be used as a place for terrorists and child molesters and people who peddle child pornography and drug traffickers to hide in the dark,\u201d Mr. Turnbull said in a television interview.The government said the spy agency has said that encryption has affected intelligence gathering in at least nine out of every 10 of its priority cases and that the proportion of encrypted internet communications it had intercepted had risen from 3% in 2013 to more than 55% at the start of July. The Australian Federal Police found that encryption had directly affected about 60 terrorism and organized-crime operations it had under way in June alone.At a news conference in Sydney, the prime minister said the government and police need the cooperation from technology companies to provide access to communications to ensure the safety of Australians but conceded that criminals could adopt their own end-to-end encryption systems.\u201cLegislation has not yet kept pace with technology,\u201d said Michael Phelan, acting commissioner of the federal police. He said police now lawfully seize material that can\u2019t be viewed because of encryption technology.Responding to pressure to monitor its network since recent terrorist attacks in Europe, Facebook said last month that it was using experts and artificial intelligence and was cooperating with others to remove terrorism content from its services. With             Microsoft Corp.      ,             Twitter Inc.       and YouTube, it formed in June a Global Internet Forum at countering terrorists and violent extremists.Elaine Pearson,        Australian director at Human Rights Watch, said encrypted apps enable activists and journalists in some parts of the world to work safely and without government interference. \u201cForcing tech companies to weaken encryption will not make us safer,\u201d she said.Write to Robb M.

Smith, a Republican political activist and financier from Chicago who mounted an effort to obtain former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails from Russian hackers, died on May 14 after asphyxiating himself in a hotel room in Rochester, Minn., according to local authorities. He was 81 years old.Mr. Smith\u2019s body was found in the Aspen Suites hotel, located across the street from the Mayo Clinic, according to a medical examiner\u2019s report. An associate of Mr. Smith said that he had recently visited the clinic. A \u00a0representative for the facility wouldn\u2019t confirm if Mr. Smith was a patient.It wasn\u2019t clear who found Mr. Smith\u2019s body.Capital Journal is WSJ.com\u2019s home for politics, policy and national security news.Mr. Smith died about 10 days after an interview with The Wall Street Journal in which he recounted his attempts to acquire what he believed were thousands of emails stolen from Mrs. Clinton\u2019s private email server. He implied that Lt. Gen.       Michael Flynn,        then serving as the senior national security adviser to presidential candidate       Donald Trump,        was aware of his efforts.Mr. Smith\u2019s attempts to obtain what he believed would be politically damaging emails marked the first potential evidence of coordination between members of the Trump campaign and Russian hackers, a central issue in probes by Congress and the Federal Bureau of Investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election.When the Journal reported on Mr. Smith\u2019s efforts last month, it wasn\u2019t clear how he died. His obituary listed no cause of death, officials in the town where he lived didn\u2019t release information, and messages left at Mr. Smith\u2019s home went unanswered.The             Chicago Tribune,       which first reported Mr. Smith\u2019s cause of death on Thursday, said a pile of documents and a statement that police called a suicide note were found with his body. The note said that Mr. Smith had been ill and that he held a life-insurance policy that was due to expire, the Tribune reported.Mr. Smith apologized in the note and said that \u201cno foul play whatsoever\u201d had occurred with his death, according to the Tribune.In emails and documents meant to recruit others to his efforts to find Mrs. Clinton\u2019s deleted emails, Mr. Smith and an associate identified Mr. Flynn\u2019s company, Flynn Intel Group, and Michael G. Flynn, the general\u2019s son, as allies in the operation.Neither Mr. Flynn nor his son responded to requests for comment at the time of the original article.The group Mr. Smith assembled included technical experts, lawyers and a private investigator in Europe who spoke Russian, he said. The group made contacts with five groups of hackers, including two that were Russian, who claimed to have obtained Mrs. Clinton\u2019s emails, Mr. Smith said. He ultimately didn\u2019t acquire the messages because he said he couldn\u2019t verify their authenticity. Instead, he urged the hackers to give the emails to WikiLeaks.Mr. Smith also listed senior members of the Trump campaign, including some who now serve as top aides in the White House, in a recruitment document for his effort.\u00a0The White House officials contacted by the Journal said they were unaware of his efforts and why their names appeared in the document.Write to Shane Harris at shane.harris@wsj.com and Reid J.

The investigation will also look into alleged student \u201csexual conquest rituals\u201d associated with a highly publicized trial in 2015, and allegations of a similar ritual that were reported in local media last month.St. Paul\u2019s said in late June that it had hired an outside investigator to look into the allegations.\u201cProtection of children is a paramount priority for law enforcement,\u201d Mr. MacDonald said in a statement. \u201cI am confident that an institution such as St. Paul\u2019s School will be fully cooperative with this investigation.\u201dThe investigation, which the attorney general said he is conducting with the county attorney and state and local police, will focus initially on whether St. Paul\u2019s engaged in conduct that endangered the welfare of a child, according to the statement.St. Paul\u2019s Rector Mike Hirschfeld said the school has been in close contact with law enforcement and will continue to cooperate fully.\u201cOur goal is always and will be the health, safety, and well-being of our students and we will work tirelessly to meet that goal and strengthen faith in St. Paul\u2019s School,\u201d Mr. Hirschfeld said in a statement Thursday.In May, St. Paul\u2019s, a 161-year-old Episcopal boarding school with around 525 students, released a report disclosing past sexual misconduct by more than a dozen faculty members and staff following a lengthy investigation.St. Paul\u2019s separately drew national attention in 2015 when former student       Owen Labrie      was convicted of misdemeanor sexual assault and sentenced to a year in jail for having sex with a 15-year-old classmate the previous year. Mr. Labrie was 18 at the time and about to graduate.In his trial, Mr. Labrie said his encounter with the girl was part of a \u201csenior salute,\u201d which he described as a campus rite in which graduating seniors pursue younger classmates for trysts that could include sexual intercourse.St. Paul\u2019s denied that the \u201csenior salute\u201d was a long tradition and said the phrase was \u201cnever understood to include the conduct engaged in by Owen Labrie.\u201dThe New Hampshire Coalition Against Domestic and Sexual Violence commended the attorney general for launching an investigation.\u201cElite boarding schools are in many ways exceptional,\u201d a spokeswoman for the organization said in a statement, \u201cbut they are not above the law.\u201dWrite to Jennifer Levitz at jennifer.levitz@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-14 01:25:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-hampshire-opens-sexual-assault-investigation-into-st-pauls-1499994891", "news_title": "New Hampshire Opens Sexual-Assault Investigation Into St. Paul\u2019s", "keywords": "st. paul's attorney general,st. paul's criminal investigation,st. paul's sexual assault,St. Paul's School,political,general news,crime,legal action,education,private education,sex crimes,school"}, {"content": "Senate Republicans unveiled a revised health bill in an effort to shore up its faltering GOP support, but the measure\u2019s future remained precarious.Trump\u2019s budget proposal would shrink federal deficits by nearly a third over the coming decade but not eliminate them, the CBO said.A federal judge ordered a loosening of Trump\u2019s temporary ban on U.S. entry for some travelers from six Muslim-majority countries.Lawmakers will be able to delay steps to address imbalances in the system for federal disability payments due to a decline in Americans receiving such benefits.Trump and Macron met in Paris and touted the growing bond between the U.S. and France, a pointed bid to move past divisions.Brazil\u2019s ex-leader da Silva vowed to overturn his conviction and declared his intent to return as president.The Justice Department said it has charged over 400 people with committing health fraud that generated $1.3 billion in false billings.A GOP activist who mounted an effort to obtain Clinton emails died on May 14 after asphyxiating himself, according to authorities.A federal appeals court vacated the conviction of former New York state Assembly Speaker Silver.Died: Liu Xiaobo, 61, Chinese dissident and Nobel Peace laureate.Appeared in the July 14, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-07-14 00:05:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/whats-news-world-wide-1500005122", "news_title": "What\u2019s News: World-Wide", "keywords": "political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,page-one stories,news digests"}]
