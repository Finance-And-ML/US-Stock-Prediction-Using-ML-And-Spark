[{"content": "The founder of a website that gives betting advice to gamblers is suing the owner of sports website Deadspin for defamation over an article that questioned his honesty and claimed he was profiting at his customers\u2019 expense.RJ Bell,        a Las Vegas oddsmaker who runs Pregame.com, alleges the June 2016 article contains false and libelous statements that have hurt his reputation and cost him business. The lawsuit was filed Thursday in New York state court against Gawker Media\u2019s successor Gizmodo Media Group and the article\u2019s author. Mr. Bell is seeking at least $10 million plus punitive damages.Mr. Bell is being represented by Charles Harder, the same lawyer who represented Hulk Hogan in his lawsuit against Gawker Media over the publication of the professional wrestler\u2019s sex tape. Gawker was ultimately forced into bankruptcy following a $140 million judgment against it in the Hogan case.That lawsuit against Gawker was financed by venture capitalist      Peter Thiel,        who had been angered by an article published nearly a decade earlier that identified him as gay. Deadspin and its sister sites\u2014but not Gawker.com\u2014were ultimately sold following a bankruptcy auction to Univision Communications Inc.Following the auction, Mr. Harder sent a demand letter stating that Mr. Bell would have actionable legal claims against Univision if the story wasn\u2019t taken down. Mr. Harder has also demanded the retraction of at least four other Gawker stories, according to the company.The story at issue in Thursday\u2019s lawsuit, \u201cHow America\u2019s Favorite Sports Betting Expert Turned A Sucker\u2019s Game Into An Industry\u201d was written by Ryan Goldberg, a freelance reporter whose work has appeared in the             New York Times,       ProPublica and more than a dozen other newspapers and magazines. The report was the culmination of Mr. Goldberg\u2019s yearlong investigation of the betting industry.Mr. Bell\u2019s lawsuit claims the Deadspin article contains \u201cnumerous false, fabricated, fictitious, and outright libelous statements\u201d that harmed his personal and professional reputation.A spokesperson for Fusion Media, the division of Univision that is now home to the former Gawker blogs, declined to comment on Friday, saying the company has not been served with the lawsuit. Messrs. Bell, Goldberg and Harder weren\u2019t immediately available for comment.Mr. Bell, however took to             Twitter                   on Friday to explain why he was suing Deadspin.\u201cGamblers want to know that the experts they seek out are giving them honest advice that the experts would stake their own money on,\u201d the lawsuit said. \u201cA claim that an expert is not doing this, and in fact stands to profit when his or her customers lose, strikes at the very heart of this relationship and is absolutely poisonous for anyone in Plaintiffs\u2019 line of work.\u201dIn a letter posted on Gawker before the auction, the company\u2019s former general counsel Heather Dietrick said Mr. Harder has \u201cprovided no ground for a retraction.\u201d Ms. Dietrick has since been hired by The Daily Beast.Thursday\u2019s lawsuit comes as a bankruptcy judge, still wading through Gawker\u2019s chapter 11 case, weighs a request by representatives of the estate to subpoena Messrs. Harder and Thiel. Lawyers for Gawker are seeking information about connections between the two and evidence, if any exists, to build a potential lawsuit against Mr. Thiel.Mr. Thiel wasn\u2019t immediately available for comment. A lawyer for Mr. Thiel has previously said there was no basis for a lawsuit against the billionaire investor.Gawker\u2019s plan for repaying creditors, approved by a bankruptcy judge in December, included liability releases intended to shield reporters who had written stories for Deadspin and the other sites. However, Judge Stuart Bernstein said when he approved the plan that the protection couldn\u2019t guard against allegations of gross negligence or willful misconduct. The lawsuit claims that Mr. Goldberg acted with \u201cactual malice.\u201dCorrections & Amplifications   Ryan Goldberg wrote a 2016 article on Deadspin that is the subject of a lawsuit by RJ Bell.

The charge\u00a0carries a minimum 15-year prison sentence.Three of the four players charged with the most serious crimes in the incident have now been found guilty of at least some of those charges.Prosecutors alleged that Mr. Banks participated in some portions of the rape and encouraged his then-teammates at other times.\u00a0They showed video that the players took during the June 23, 2013, sexual assault, in which the woman is being penetrated by a water bottle and the players are laughing.The defense argued during the four-day trial that Mr. Banks was under duress, had been abused and bullied by his teammates, and had no choice but to participate in the rape. Mr. Banks testified in his own defense on Wednesday.The jury, with\u00a0eight women and four men, deliberated for about 15 hours.Mr. Banks\u2019s former teammate,       Brandon Vandenburg,        had been cast by the other defendants as the ringleader. He was found guilty last June of five counts of aggravated rape and two counts of aggravated sexual battery and sentenced in November to 17 years in prison.Corey Batey       was sentenced last summer to 15 years for his role in the incident. Mr. Vandenburg and Mr. Batey had been found guilty in January 2015, but a mistrial was declared after it was discovered that a juror had been sexually assaulted.The case against Jaborian \u201cTip\u201d McKenzie, who has testified against the other three, is pending.After leaving Vanderbilt, Mr. Banks arrived at Butte College, a community college in Oroville, Calif., in the summer of 2014 for preseason football practice. Administrators there said they didn\u2019t know about the rape and sexual battery charges at the time, according to a Wall Street Journal article about student-athletes who transfer and continue to play after facing serious criminal charges.Mr. Banks left Butte at the request of school officials after they learned about his background, and enrolled at Lane College in Jackson, Tenn., where he was on the roster last fall.\u2014Joseph Barrett contributed to this article.Write to Melissa Korn at melissa.korn@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-23 21:47:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/former-vanderbilt-football-player-found-guilty-in-2013-rape-of-unconscious-woman-1498265673", "news_title": "Former Vanderbilt Football Player Found Guilty in 2013 Rape of Unconscious Woman ", "keywords": " football players accused of rape',vanderbilt dorm room, vanderbilt football players, vanderbilt football program,vanderbilt rape, vanderbilt sex assault,Vanderbilt University,Brandon Banks,american football,political,general news,crime,legal action,sex crimes,sports,recreation,routine general news"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014The State Department will eliminate the post of special envoy on Afghanistan and Pakistan, leaving the       Trump       administration without a policy point person as the U.S. prepares to send thousands of new troops to Afghanistan, current and former U.S. officials said Friday.The official serving as acting special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan,       Laurel Miller,        was set to leave the post on Friday. The decision comes as Defense Secretary       Jim Mattis       heads a broad policy review for the two countries while the U.S. tries to halt Taliban and Islamic State gains that are threatening the region.The move, current and former officials said, downgrades the importance of the issue at a time when the Trump administration is poised to ramp up American involvement in the region. Elimination of the office minimizes the input of civilians with regional expertise, fueling perceptions that the strategy would tilt toward the military.The State Department said Ms. Miller\u2019s departure didn\u2019t signal a reduction in the importance it places on South Asia and indicated that Secretary of State       Rex Tillerson       might still appoint someone to a similar position with less authority. That decision isn\u2019t expected any time soon, which leaves State with no senior official with experience in the region to champion the department\u2019s position in policy debates.Dan Feldman, who served in the post from 2014 to 2015, said the decision \u201cseems remarkably shortsighted and further marginalizes State Department equities, and diplomatic and political interests, at a critical moment when we\u2019re on the verge of surging militarily again.\u201dMr. Mattis is working on a regional strategy and completing plans to send more than 4,000 troops to Afghanistan in an effort to reverse gains made by the Taliban and Islamic State. The U.S. Defense Department hopes to present a regional plan by mid-July that includes broader political and economic pillars of the proposal.While the importance of the office diminished in recent years as the U.S. reduced its military, economic and political footprint in Afghanistan, it was central to the Obama administration\u2019s effort to jump-start peace talks meant to bring the war to an end.\u201cThere\u2019s no clear strategy for the long-term sustainability of Afghanistan without a negotiated political settlement, and this decision means there\u2019s now no one at State charged with the responsibility to implement any diplomatic strategy once decided,\u201d Mr. Feldman said.Kelly Magsamen, a former acting assistance secretary of defense for Asian and Pacific security affairs who oversaw Afghanistan and Pakistan policy at the Pentagon until January, said the State Department has a vital role to play in developing a new strategy.\u201cWe need an effective and focused diplomatic strategy now more than ever to compliment any troop surge,\u201d Ms. Magsamen said. \u201cWho is going to lead that?\u201dNot everyone sees dissolution of the office as a bad idea. A number of former U.S. officials said the office created an unnecessary parallel structure at State and called for its responsibilities to be merged with the regional bureau. The duties of the post, created by President       Barack Obama       when he first took office in 2009, will be folded back into the Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs, which currently has no acting assistant secretary, the officials said. President Donald Trump\u2019s proposed budget would cut spending at the State Department and related Agency for International Development by 32%.Since taking over the State Department in February, Mr. Tillerson has primarily focused on Russia and North Korea, frustrating some officials who see the long-running conflict in Afghanistan getting less attention. Mr. Mattis and other Pentagon leaders are counting on strong support from the State Department to capitalize on military gains and craft regional political solutions.\u201cThe Pentagon isn\u2019t thrilled just sending troops off to Afghanistan to fight forever,\u201d one U.S. official said. \u201cThe Pentagon likes to know what the endgame is when they go off to fight.\u201dThe Afghan-Pakistan post, first held by the late U.S. diplomat       Richard Holbrooke,        has served for years as a key position in driving the U.S. strategy in Afghanistan and Pakistan.\u201cThis effectively guts the institutional memory on Afghanistan and Pakistan at a moment when a new administration would hopefully be drawing from it,\u201d Mr. Feldman said. \u201cThe point of creating this position was to elevate this issue and ensure that the U.S. government exercised political equities which matched its military equities. By eliminating the office and downgrading the position, it will ensure that the perception is that diplomatic interests are subservient to military ones.\u201dWrite to Dion Nissenbaum at dion.nissenbaum@wsj.com, Gordon Lubold at Gordon.Lubold@wsj.com and Felicia Schwartz at Felicia.Schwartz@wsj.comAppeared in the June 24, 2017, print edition as 'U.S. Scraps Envoy Post.'", "news_time": "2017-06-23 21:43:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-state-department-to-eliminate-special-envoy-to-afghanistan-pakistan-1498234280", "news_title": "U.S. State Department to Eliminate Special Envoy to Afghanistan, Pakistan   ", "keywords": "afghanistan,defense department,islamic state,jim mattis,pakistan,president trump,rex tillerson,state department,taliban,Jim Mattis,Rex Tillerson,Laurel Miller,plans,strategy,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,national,public security,crime,legal action,international relations,politics,domestic politics,terrorism,government bodies,executive branch"}, {"content": "People wearing colored jackets in Chicago were shouting at each other about cheese for the final time on Friday.A daily 10-minute auction in Chicago that helps set the national price of cheese will go electronic on Monday, after being held in a traditional open-outcry format for decades.             CME Group Inc.,        CME -0.32%       the exchange operator that oversees the auction, ran it Friday in its old form for the last time.\u201cWe\u2019re all going to miss the yelling and the screaming,\u201d said       Dean Kinnas,        a dairy options trader at the CME-owned Chicago Board of Trade, or CBOT, exchange.The \u201cspot call\u201d cheese auction is among the smaller and more obscure markets in CME\u2019s empire. Until Friday, it was held in a corner of the CBOT trading floor in downtown Chicago each weekday at 10:45 a.m. Central time. There are often only a handful of trades\u2014each representing a \u201ccarload\u201d of 40,000 to 44,000 pounds of cheddar\u2014executed each day by a small group of dairy brokers.CME hopes the electronic platform will boost participation, with companies able to access the auction and monitor prices from anywhere in the world.Earlier this year, CME shifted similar auctions for butter and nonfat dry milk to the new format, and it said participation has increased.Increasing volumes could also bolster confidence in the benchmark cheese price that is determined by the auction. The cheese benchmark has been dogged by allegations of market manipulation over its centurylong history.Last year, around 50 million pounds of cheese were traded in the auction, less than 1% of total U.S. cheese production, dairy-market observers say. Despite the relatively small volumes, the daily spot price from the auction is widely used in the U.S. cheese business.More than 80% of the wholesale cheese transactions in the U.S. are priced off the CME spot cheddar price, said       Dave Kurzawski,        a senior dairy broker at             INTL FCStone Inc.Other types of cheese are typically bought and sold at a premium or discount to cheddar. For instance, a dairy-plant operator might agree to sell mozzarella for 10 cents a pound above the average price of CME spot cheddar from the previous week.\u201cCheddar is kind of the lowest common denominator of cheeses,\u201d Mr. Kurzawski said.The number of open-outcry trading floors has dwindled amid the inexorable shift to electronic markets. In December, CME shut down the trading floor of the New York Mercantile Exchange in Manhattan, the longtime home of pits for oil and gold futures, following a long decline in open-outcry volumes.At the spot cheese auction on Thursday, some 20 brokers barked and haggled, phones pressed to their ears as they relayed orders from customers such as dairy plants and food processors.Factors that could affect the price include demand from food processors for cheese, as well as the cost of milk.Cheese at the auction is traded in both barrels and blocks at different prices. Both have fallen this year. A barrel of cheddar, which is used primarily for processing, rose 2.2% to $1.37 a pound on Friday but was down 14% for the year. A block of cheddar, used for cutting, fell 0.3% to $1.54 a pound, down 7% for the year so far.Pete Turk,        a co-owner of Rice Dairy LLC who has been a broker at the cheese auction since 2005, said that going electronic would deprive the market of the emotional buzz that comes with face-to-face trading. \u201cYou can\u2019t feel a screen,\u201d he said on the sidelines of the auction on Thursday. \u201cPeople like to see and feel that emotion to understand what\u2019s going on.\u201dThe cheese auction traces its history back to the founding of the Wisconsin Cheese Exchange in 1918. Later renamed the National Cheese Exchange, it was based for decades in Green Bay, Wis. In 1997, it closed down, and the market shifted to Chicago.Rumors of market manipulation tarnished the reputation of the National Cheese Exchange, with dairy farmers accusing             Kraft Foods Inc.       and other big food companies of using it to keep prices artificially low. Multiple lawsuits filed by farmers against Kraft in the late 1990s were all eventually thrown out, and regulators never filed charges against the food company, which denied the accusations.Moving the market to Chicago put the cheese auction under CME\u2019s surveillance and regulation, but that didn\u2019t end concerns about possible manipulation. In 2008, the Dairy Farmers of America Inc. and two of its former executives paid $12 million to settle allegations by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission that they had attempted to manipulate the price of milk futures by repeatedly buying cheddar in the auction.

Health-care companies joined the climb, including Thursday when Senate Republicans unveiled their plans to overhaul the Affordable Care Act.The broad S&P 500 index rose 3.8 points, or 0.2%, to 2438.30 on Friday, while the             Nasdaq Co      mposite added 28.56, or 0.5%, to 6265.25.

And it was a reminder that Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies are still effectively under construction, and don\u2019t feature all of the protections that stock and bond investors are used to.Both Ethereum, which started in 2013 and its eight-year-old cousin, bitcoin, have garnered enthusiasm among technology buffs who see the currencies as a way to transact more directly, without middlemen like banks.Speculative investors have jumped onto the currencies, called cryptocurrencies because they incorporate concepts used in cryptography to shield user identities. This year, bitcoin is up 185%, while Ether has skyrocketed from $8 to $340.But this week\u2019s volatility in Ethereum serves as a reminder to investors that these currencies basically trade on a technological Wild West, where undoing or altering trades to smooth out mistakes is discouraged.On Friday, the exchange operator at the center of the issue, Coinbase\u2019s GDAX platform, said it would credit some customers hurt by the volatility, but said it wouldn\u2019t reverse trades.\u201cWe will establish a process to credit customer accounts which experienced a margin call or stop loss order,\u201d the company noted in a blog post late Friday. The credits will come from company funds and \u201callow eligible customers to restore the value of their account,\u201d it added. Customers are expected to be notified next week.Trading in Ethereum has been on the rise since this spring. A surge in activity in the past few days was driven by investor demand for an initial coin offering that overwhelmed several exchanges that trade Ethereum.The offerings, which resemble a crowdfunding effort for digital services, have proliferated in recent months.Some exchanges, unable to process the backlog, simply froze trading, and one, the GDAX platform, saw an actual crash sparked by one large sell order.Tuesday, there were a record 308,000 transactions, according to the research site Etherscan, about 10 times the volume from the start of the year.The surge seems to have caught many exchanges off guard.The flash crash in Ethereum happened\u00a0on Wednesday, at\u00a03:30 p.m.\u00a0EDT, when one \u201cmultimillion-dollar market sell\u201d order was placed on GDAX, according to Coinbase\u2019s       Adam White       in an earlier blog post. That sell order sparked a cascade of about 800 automatic stop-loss orders and margin-funding liquidations, Mr. White noted in the blog post.At the end of that cascading wave, the currency briefly traded at 10 cents. Before the flash crash, it had been trading at about $335.There wasn\u2019t any indication that the trades were caused by any wrongdoing or fraud, Mr. White noted, and the exchange\u2019s matching engine worked as designed, even if the trades were extreme. In other words, the trades were legitimate.\u201cIt is important to note that these trades are final in accordance with our GDAX trading rules,\u201d Mr. White wrote. \u201cHonoring properly executed orders is critical to maintaining the integrity of an exchange.\u201dAfter the 2010 flash crash in the stock market, in which the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by nearly 1,000 points, many of the most extreme trades were reversed.Moreover, the exchanges that trade these assets don\u2019t have trading curbs, or circuit breakers, or even a closing bell. These automated exchanges run 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Some exchanges offer more sophisticated \u201cstop\u201d orders, options and leveraged trading tools for individuals, though critics say some of then essentially amount to layering risky borrowing on top of an already volatile asset.Ethereum is a digital relative of bitcoin, but differs from the latter in important respects.Bitcoin is a protocol designed to support trading of an asset also called bitcoin. Ethereum makes use of the concepts behind bitcoin, but is designed to support online services and apps.Its backers promote it as a \u201cvirtual computer\u201d and it can be thought of as a decentralized internet. Within its network, its native currency is called ether.The flash crash isn\u2019t Ethereum\u2019s first bump along its road.One year ago, a startup called the DAO raised more than $100 million worth of ether but suffered a debilitating hack that allowed a malicious actor to direct some of the funds to a personal account.Etherum\u2019s core founders and developers controversially unwound the DAO\u2019s entire trading history, and the currency essentially split into two, one altered and one left alone.Both Ethereum and bitcoin hit records earlier this month.

Both are on five-week losing streaks, the longest for U.S. oil since 2015.Signs that big producers are abiding by their deal to limit output and weather-related output challenges in the U.S. supported prices. The recent moves higher came after crude plunged into a bear market this week for the first time since last summer, as the oversupply is so far proving immune to the limits set by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its big-producer allies including Russia.\u201cYes, we remain long-term bearish, but traders should be weary of selling down here,\u201d the Chicago brokerage iiTrader told clients in a note Friday. \u201cSentiment is a little too bearish at this moment and ahead of the weekend.\u201dA monitoring committee made up of OPEC members and producers outside the group on Thursday said that compliance to the deal reached 106% in May, the highest since the deal was first clinched late last year.In the U.S., production growth and crude inventories may show a decline next week as inclement weather in the Gulf of Mexico has shut a number of oil rigs and platforms, analysts say. According to JBS Energy, 300,000 barrels a day of production were shut in.Any signs of deceleration in U.S. production would support the market, which is still mired in surplus. But for now, many analysts remain pessimistic about oil\u2019s outlook and dismissive of Friday\u2019s gains.\u201cIt\u2019s noise,\u201d said Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates in Houston. \u201cThe market remains under pressure from increasing production.\u201dIt is doubtful oil\u2019s spiral is over, analysts at             Commerzbank                   said.High global oil inventories are \u201craising market concerns about the efficacy of OPEC market management,\u201d said       Jason Gammel,        analyst at Jefferies. \u201cWe remain of the view that inventories will [decline in the second half of the year], but empirical evidence of this is likely necessary for oil prices to inflect into an upward trend.\u201dGasoline futures eased 0.04 cent, or 0.03%, to $1.4341 a gallon.

Other demands include that Doha must pay reparations and provide information on all groups it has supported but that Saudi Arabia and others oppose.Saudi Arabia and the U.A.E. have led an aggressive campaign this month to isolate Qatar and attempt to force it to comply with regional and foreign policies championed by its larger Gulf Arab neighbors. A U.A.E. official described the list of demands as part of mediation efforts.Qatar\u2019s foreign ministry in a statement late Friday said it has received the list of demands, which Kuwait delivered on Thursday. The brief statement said Qatar is currently studying the demands and will prepare an appropriate response, which it will hand over to Kuwait. It also appreciated Kuwait\u2019s efforts aimed at resolving the crisis.A senior Saudi official said a draft list reviewed by The Wall Street Journal matched the official version, which wasn\u2019t made public.By including Turkey in the list, the demands further complicate the balance for the U.S., which has allies on both sides. President       Donald Trump       has sought to develop the U.S. alliance with Saudi Arabia; the U.S. also has its largest Mideast military base in Qatar, and a counterterrorism alliance with Turkey, a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.The       Trump       administration views the list as the opening gambit in a negotiation, a U.S. official said. The demand that Turkey close its base would depend on other countries moving other bases, and is unlikely to come to fruition, the official said.The U.S., however, would be potentially supportive of calls to shut down Al Jazeera, which the U.S. has viewed as increasingly problematic, the official said.Turkey said it had no plans to reconsider its base deal with Qatar or the countries\u2019 2014 bilateral military agreement. Turkey has around 100 soldiers stationed in Qatar as part of a mission to train Qatari soldiers in defensive tactical skills, according to Turkish military officials. The 10-day deadline coincides with planned joint military exercises.The request for Qatar to end its military agreement with Turkey appeared to be a signal from Riyadh and its partners that they won\u2019t allow their say in their own backyard to be diluted\u2014though Ankara and Doha provide crucial bases for the U.S.-led campaign against Islamic State.The U.S. State Department and Secretary of State       Rex Tillerson       have yet to make a formal statement on the demands.\u201cThe four countries that are part of that\u2014we believe it\u2019s a family issue and that they should work [it] out,\u201d said White House press secretary       Sean Spicer.       \u201cIf we can help facilitate those discussions then so be it. They want to, and should work out for themselves.\u201dIt is unclear how or whether further mediation between Qatar and its neighbors would unfold. Mr. Tillerson and President       Recep Tayyip Erdogan       have been trying to bridge the divide for several days.Qatar\u2019s foreign minister, Sheikh       Mohammed       bin Abdulrahim Al-Thani, said earlier that Doha wouldn\u2019t enter negotiations to resolve the dispute until all economic, diplomatic and travel ties are restored.The breadth of Thursday\u2019s demands suggests that Qatar\u2019s adversaries are preparing for a protracted battle of wills that could lead to the country\u2019s expulsion from the Gulf Cooperation Council, the regional bloc of Sunni Muslim monarchies, an expert on the region said.\u201cThese demands are so draconian that it is hard to imagine that the four countries want anything less than a long, drawn-out break with Qatar that leads to Qatar one day\u2014one way or another\u2014coming their way,\u201d said Andrew Hammond, a researcher at Oxford University\u2019s St. Antony\u2019s College.For Qatar to relent to the Saudi-led demands would amount to a complete rejection of everything its rulers have stood for in the past two decades, said Mr. Hammond, who is the author of a book on Saudi Arabia.Saudi Arabia and its allies broke ties with Qatar earlier this month, accusing Doha of fomenting extremism in the region and meddling in their internal affairs, allegations that Mr. Trump has echoed and Qatar has denied.The countries also severed transport ties to Qatar, disrupting airline traffic, snarling shipping routes and squeezing food supplies to the Gulf nation.The regional diplomatic crisis and Saudi Arabia\u2019s move to bring its fellow Sunni Muslim monarchy into line coincides with a period of deep political change in the kingdom, the region\u2019s richest economy.Saudi Arabia\u2019s       King Salman       this week made his 31-year-old son Mohammed bin Salman next in line to the throne, a sign that Riyadh is gearing up to more vigorously pursue what it sees as its vital interests in the region.Prince Mohammed has overseen far-reaching economic reforms at home and supported a costly war in neighboring Yemen to check what the kingdom sees as the creeping influence of its main regional rival, Iran.The list of demands to Qatar calls on it to reduce diplomatic representation with Iran and expel elements of its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, the elite military arm of the Iranian government that has funded armed groups in the region partly through extensive business dealings.One seed of the crisis appears to have been the posting late last month on the official Qatari news agency of comments, purportedly by Qatar\u2019s emir, that praised Iran. An outraged Saudi Arabia and its allies responded by blocking websites of Qatari news outlets. Doha said the news agency had been hacked and denied the emir had made the comments.In recent years, gas-rich Qatar, a nation of 2.3 million people, has come under criticism for using some of its vast wealth to back political and armed groups that other Sunni Muslim monarchies in the region view as a threat to their rule and their brand of Islam.Qatar has countered that it has served an essential mediating role between other feuding countries and such groups, including Afghanistan\u2019s Taliban insurgency and Hamas, a militant group that rules the Gaza Strip.For Qatar, closing Al Jazeera would mean pulling the plug on a global news network that in recent years has aggressively covered the region\u2019s political and social upheavals and given the tiny nation an international profile and influence far beyond its size.In a video posted on the Al Jazeera English Twitter account, Giles Trendle, acting managing director of Al Jazeera English, denounced the demand for the network\u2019s closure.\u201cI just find it quite incredible\u2014it\u2019s a bit like Germany demanding Britain to close down the BBC. I mean it\u2019s that kind of almost absurdity.\u201d\u2014       Margaret Coker,        Ned Levin and Felicia Schwartz contributed to this article.Write to Nicolas Parasie at nicolas.parasie@wsj.com and Summer Said at summer.said@wsj.comAppeared in the June 24, 2017, print edition as 'Arab States Issue Demands to Qatar.'", "news_time": "2017-06-23 20:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/arab-states-demand-qatar-close-al-jazeera-shutter-turkish-base-1498193557", "news_title": "Arab States Demand Qatar Close Al Jazeera, Shut Turkish Base ", "keywords": " al jazeera, arab states, middle east, muslim brotherhood,qatar, soudi arabia, turkish military base,Muslim Brotherhood,political,general news,international relations,international sanctions,politics,domestic politics,government bodies,executive branch,state department,broadcasting,television broadcasting,satellite broadcasting,media,entertainment,satellite television"}, {"content": "Barely a week after raising short-term interest rates for the second time this year, Federal Reserve officials are increasingly divided on the timing of their next move, with some saying they won\u2019t support another increase until they see a pickup in inflation.Inflation, as measured by the Fed\u2019s preferred gauge, breached its annual 2% goal in February for the first time in nearly five years but has since retreated, sinking to 1.7% in April.Fed officials in their public remarks since their policy meeting last week have disagreed on whether the recent weakening of price pressures is likely transitory or perhaps more persistent.Fed Chairwoman       Janet Yellen,        New York Fed President       William Dudley       and Cleveland Fed chief       Loretta Mester       view the recent sluggishness as probably temporary, driven by some one-time factors such as new, more generous cellphone plans and slower growth in prescription drug prices.Others such as regional Fed bank presidents       Charles Evans       of Chicago,       Neel Kashkari       of Minneapolis,       Robert Kaplan       of Dallas and       James Bullard       of St. Louis have expressed more concern about slower inflation.Mr. Kaplan told reporters this week in San Francisco he would like to see more evidence that weak inflation has passed before raising short-term interest rates again. \u201cI\u2019d like to see now a confirmation in the data that the recent weakness in March, and to some extent April and May, was transitory,\u201d he said.Mr. Evans said in an interview Tuesday he would prefer to\u00a0hold off on raising rates\u00a0until the end of the year to make sure the Fed wasn\u2019t falling further behind on its inflation goal. \u201cI sometimes wonder if there isn\u2019t something more global, more technological that\u2019s taking place that we don\u2019t quite have our arms around very well,\u201dMr. Kashkari voted against the Fed\u2019s decisions to raise rates in March and June, and last week cited low inflation as a reason.The other camp is more confident that inflation will head higher.\u201cInflation is on this gradual upwards path that we\u2019ve been projecting for a while,\u201d Ms. Mester told reporters following a speech in Cleveland\u00a0on Friday. \u201cWe got a couple of weak reports but fundamentally it doesn\u2019t look like demand is falling out.\u201dMr. Dudley also shrugged off the disappointing inflation numbers in an appearance\u00a0Monday. \u201cIf the labor market continues to tighten, wages will gradually pick up, and with that we\u2019ll see inflation get back to 2%,\u201d he said.Ms. Yellen last week played down the recent numbers. \u201cIt\u2019s important not to overreact to a few readings and data on inflation can be noisy,\u201d she said June 14.The divide could threaten the consensus that Ms. Yellen has cultivated in her time at the helm. Fed officials last week penciled in one more rate increase this year, but left open the question of when that might occur. Mr. Evans and Mr. Kaplan, in addition to Mr. Kashkari, hold votes on the Fed\u2019s policy-making committee this year, raising the possibility of more dissents in the coming months.Mr. Bullard isn\u2019t a voter this year and doesn\u2019t support any more rate increases in 2017. \u201cThe U.S. economy remains in a low-growth, low-inflation, low-interest-rate regime,\u201d Mr. Bullard said\u00a0Friday\u00a0in Nashville, Tenn. \u201cThe current level of the U.S. policy rate is likely to be appropriate for this regime over the forecast horizon.\u201dThe disagreements among officials reflect a conundrum that has perplexed economists since the end of the recession. As the unemployment rate has dropped, to 4.3% in May, economic theory would predict higher wages and rising prices. But wage growth has been relatively modest and inflation has undershot expectations, leading some to question whether something has fundamentally changed in the economy to hold down prices and interest rates.Falling oil prices and bond yields could add another wrinkle to the Fed\u2019s ongoing debate over monetary policy.Oil prices dropped to their lowest level in more than 10 months\u00a0Wednesday, leading investors to expect continued sluggish inflation in the months ahead. Yields on the 10-year Treasury note have sunk to their lowest levels of the year in recent days, a sign that investors don\u2019t see a pickup in prices and economic activity in the near term.Investors are roughly evenly split over the odds of another Fed rate increase this year, according to data compiled by             CME Group.Low oil prices will likely push inflation closer to 1% than to 2% over the next six months, according to       Gregory Daco,        head of U.S. Economics at Oxford Economics. That will keep Treasury yields down and force the Fed to postpone its next rate increase, he wrote in a note to clients\u00a0Friday.Write to David Harrison at david.harrison@wsj.comAppeared in the June 24, 2017, print edition as 'Fed Officials Split On Inflation\u2019s Path.'", "news_time": "2017-06-23 19:28:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-officials-split-on-inflations-path-1498260488", "news_title": "Fed Officials Split on Inflation\u2019s Path", "keywords": "Federal Reserve,economic performance,indicators,inflation,prices,monetary policy,interest rates,economic news"}, {"content": "A fifth Republican senator said Friday he couldn\u2019t support the newly released Senate bill to overhaul the nation\u2019s health-care system, putting GOP leaders in an increasingly shaky spot as they seek a vote next week.Dean Heller of Nevada joined four other GOP senators objecting to the current version of the bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare. His opposition further complicated party leaders\u2019 task of cobbling enough votes to pass the marquee legislation under the rapid-fire timetable they set.\u201cI cannot support legislation that takes away insurance from millions of Americans and hundreds of thousands of Nevadans,\u201d said Sen. Heller, who faces a difficult re-election fight next year. \u201cMake no mistake, the Affordable Care Act does need fixing. But the bill in front of us today doesn\u2019t make those fixes.\u201dWith 52 Republicans in the Senate and no Democrats planning to support the bill, the GOP can\u2019t afford to lose more than two votes.The challenge facing GOP leaders is that the first four senators who objected to the bill cited conservative reasons, saying they wanted to see costs lowered, which would likely require more deregulation of the insurance market. It was unclear whether Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) can placate both camps.Mr. McConnell won\u2019t have much time, and the next few days are likely to see a frenzy of activity. Senate leaders hope to begin procedural votes on the bill on Tuesday, which gives them just days to navigate a highly complex political and policy thicket.Adding to the uncertainty, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office is expected to release on Monday its assessment of the bill\u2019s impact on cost and coverage. The CBO\u2019s report could create more obstacles for GOP leaders who want a vote as early as Thursday.Democrats\u2019 ability to slow down or stop the GOP health push is limited, but they plan to use their time on the Senate floor as the bill is debated to frame their arguments and offer amendments that they hope will put Republicans on the spot, aides said.In addition to the five senators who have said they can\u2019t support the bill, a range of other Republican senators have expressed concerns since the bill\u2019s release on Thursday, including Sen.       Susan Collins       of Maine, who is worried about its cuts to Medicaid. She and Sen.       Lisa Murkowski       (R., Alaska) also object to the bill\u2019s limits on funding to Planned Parenthood Federation of America.Senate leaders said they are open to talking about ways to improve the bill, which they have been careful to call a discussion draft.\u201cAre we just putting the bill out there knowing it\u2019s going to fail? The answer to that is no,\u201d said Sen.       John Cornyn       of Texas, the Senate\u2019s second-ranking Republican.Mr. McConnell is trying to nudge conservative GOP senators along, in particular by saying the failure to pass legislation could create an opening for Senate Democrats to craft their own bill cementing the 2010 health law, which was former President       Barack Obama\u2019s       signature legislative achievement.Some conservatives criticize the Senate GOP bill for not doing enough to repeal the law. The Senate bill would retain the law\u2019s structure of tax credits for some low-income consumers, for example, though the credits would be significantly smaller.Other conservatives said the bill wouldn\u2019t do enough to bring down premiums. Sen. Ted Cruz (R., Texas), among others, wants to change the legislation to let insurers offer plans covering fewer benefits. That would allow healthier, lower-risk people to buy cheaper coverage, while those who need the benefits would be able to buy the costlier plans that include them.But some centrist GOP senators said they would be uncomfortable allowing insurers to avoid providing certain types of coverage.\u201cI want states to have more flexibility, but I think coverage for mental illness and substance abuse, for example, and maternity care are essential,\u201d Ms. Collins said.Many conservatives also want provisions to make it easier for insurers to sell their policies across state lines, although such a measure could run afoul of the special procedures Mr. McConnell is using to allow the health bill to pass with a simple majority. And they are opposed to much of the spending in the bill, including billions of dollars to help stabilize the individual insurance market.The centrist Republicans appear equally forceful. Mr. Heller made public his opposition on Friday alongside Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval, also a Republican, at a news conference in Las Vegas, saying he couldn\u2019t lend his support to the current bill because of its far-reaching changes to the Medicaid program.Mr. Heller said he opposed the measure\u2019s timetable for a rollback of the ACA\u2019s expansion of Medicaid. The bill begins phasing out that expansion in 2021 and ends federal funding for it in 2024. Mr. Heller said he favored a seven-year timetable, but would have pushed for even more time if he had the option.Other provisions that some centrists wanted in the bill\u2014including about $45 billion to fight opioid addiction\u2014were omitted. Instead, the legislation offers a $2 billion appropriation in 2018, an amount small enough to imperil the bill\u2019s support from Sens. Rob Portman (R., Ohio) and       Shelley Moore Capito       (R., W.Va.).Ms. Collins and Ms. Murkowski plan to offer an amendment next week removing the measure that defunds Planned Parenthood. It is unclear whether that amendment has enough support to pass, and whether the two senators would vote for the underlying bill if it doesn\u2019t. If it does pass, that in turn could imperil conservative support in the Senate.If Republican leaders do manage to move their health bill through the Senate, it would still have to be reconciled with the version passed by the House, where some conservatives there are already expressing reservations.Rep. Roger Williams (R., Texas) said Friday he would object if the provision defunding Planned Parenthood is removed as Ms. Collins and Ms. Murkowski want.\u201cI don\u2019t want to fund Planned Parenthood,\u201d Mr. Williams said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a federal organization and it can compete for dollars like everybody else.\u201dThe Senate bill also currently does away with the ACA requirement that most people pay a penalty if they don\u2019t have health insurance. Some senators are discussing changes to the bill to encourage people to maintain their coverage, according to people familiar with the talks. Some lawmakers said such a measure would help keep premium costs lower.Beyond this legislative Rubik\u2019s Cube, Mr. McConnell could also be constrained by the Senate parliamentarian, who must determine if the bill meets the specific requirements that allow it to pass with a simple majority vote. Such legislation must be largely limited to provisions that deal with spending or taxes.Rep. Peter Welch (D., Vt.) said GOP leaders\u2019 trouble finding an intraparty compromise on health care reflects a deep fracture among Republicans over how involved the federal government should be in providing health care.\u201cThe Republican party\u2019s divided on that,\u201d Mr. Welch said, adding that GOP senators from states that have expanded Medicaid and those in states hit hard by the opioid epidemic are pitted against those who favor more limited government. \u201cIt\u2019s a political bind over there because of the division.\u201dSenate GOP leaders are expected to work over the weekend with individual lawmakers\u2019 offices to identify their requests and decide which are feasible.\u201cWe will see the leader making backroom deals,\u201d said       Andy Slavitt,        who served as a top official at the Department of Health and Human Services under Mr. Obama. \u201cWe\u2019re going to see a very rushed week of deal-making.\u201d\u2014Louise Radnofsky contributed to this article.Write to Stephanie Armour at stephanie.armour@wsj.com, Michelle Hackman at Michelle.Hackman@wsj.com and Kristina Peterson at kristina.peterson@wsj.comAppeared in the June 24, 2017, print edition as 'Health Vote Gets Tighter For GOP.'", "news_time": "2017-06-23 18:50:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/heller-is-fifth-gop-senator-who-says-he-wont-vote-for-health-bill-in-current-form-1498246118", "news_title": "Heller Is Fifth GOP Senator Who Says He Won\u2019t Vote for Health Bill in Current Form", "keywords": " affordable care act,dean heller, gop, health bill,obamacare, republicans,senate gop health plan, senate health bill,trump,political,general news,society,community,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,upper house,welfare,social services,insurance,non-life insurance,health,medical insurance,financial services"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014The Senate Judiciary Committee is seeking information about alleged interference by former Attorney General       Loretta Lynch       into the FBI\u2019s investigation of       Hillary Clinton\u2019s       handling of classified information on a private email server.Senate Judiciary Chairman       Chuck Grassley       of Iowa and other lawmakers sent letters Friday seeking details about communications in which Ms. Lynch reportedly assured Democratic operatives that she would keep the FBI\u2019s Clinton investigation from \u201cgoing too far.\u201d Mrs. Clinton was running to become the Democratic Party\u2019s presidential candidate at the time.The senators cited stories in the             New York Times                   and the Washington Post about a supposed Russian intelligence document saying Ms. Lynch had given assurances to the Clinton campaign about the investigation.

Residents will be temporarily checked into hotels, and the Camden authorities would work with other local governments in the London area to accommodate them, Ms. Gould said.Prime Minister       Theresa May       said on             Twitter                  : \u201cMy thoughts are with residents being evacuated in Camden while their homes are made safe tonight.\u201d\u201cWe will work with and support the emergency services and relevant authorities to safeguard the public,\u201d Mrs. May said.The U.K. government on Thursday said it had identified about 600 publicly owned residential towers that had installed some form of cladding. Authorities are now testing the cladding on those buildings to determine how many used the same material as Grenfell Tower.A government spokeswoman late Friday raised the number of cladding samples from high-rise public-housing buildings that had failed tests to 14 in nine local government areas in England. Firefighters will conduct further safety checks in the buildings and residents will be relocated if the building are deemed unsafe, she said.Decisions on evacuation are being made on a case-by-case basis based on local circumstances.The department for communities and local government, which oversees the countrywide fire-safety checks, said in a statement the council and fire services were \u201crightly working together to implement their responsibilities\u201d under the emergency review ordered by the government.A spokeswoman for the department said late Friday she was not aware of any other relocations being planned.The Grenfell blaze had started in a refrigerator-freezer before it rapidly spread across the tower block, police said Friday, and the external cladding tested in the aftermath failed fire safety tests.Authorities are considering a range of potential charges, including manslaughter, in connection with the fire, Detective Superintendent Fiona McCormack said.\u201cWe have been told the speed it spread at was unexpected, so importantly we will establish why this happened,\u201d she said. \u201cThis investigation will be exhaustive and, as we learn more, the scope and scale may well grow.\u201dShe said: \u201cWe will identify and investigate any criminal offense and, of course, given the deaths of so many people we are considering manslaughter, as well as criminal offenses and breaches of legislation and regulations.\u201d The fire wasn\u2019t set deliberately, she said.She identified the refrigerator as a Hotpoint FF175BP, which hasn\u2019t been subject to any product recall, and said the manufacturer was carrying out further tests. Whirlpool Corp., the owner of the brand in the Europe and Asia-Pacific regions, said it was working with authorities and was \u201caddressing this as a matter of utmost urgency.\u201dWhirlpool said that 64,000 such appliances were manufactured by Indesit Co. under the Hotpoint brand from 2006 to 2009. It said the model was discontinued in 2009, several years before Whirlpool acquired Indesit in 2014.The U.K. government on Thursday said it had identified about 600 publicly owned residential towers that had installed some form of cladding. Authorities are now testing the cladding on those buildings to determine how many used the same material as Grenfell Tower.The cladding material, called Reynobond PE and made by Arconic Inc., is marketed around the world. In the U.S., its use is generally limited to low-rise buildings because of fire-safety concerns. A spokeswoman for Arconic couldn't be reached for comment.In preliminary examinations, samples combusted soon after fire-safety tests started, Ms. McCormack said. Investigators immediately shared that information with local authorities throughout the country, she said.It wasn\u2019t immediately clear what the tests entailed.U.K. officials have said the material didn\u2019t meet building standards for towers taller than 18 meters, or about 59 feet. But British building industry experts and the British company that supplied the material to Grenfell Tower contractors said it complies with current building codes.The Premier Inn hotel chain told the British Broadcasting Corp. that it had concerns about the cladding used on three of its hotels, though it appeared to be of a less flammable type than that used at Grenfell Tower.The fire investigation might not conclude until the end of the year because of difficult conditions inside the tower\u2019s burned remains. Investigators are still trying to clarify the exact death toll of the fire and some victims may never be identified because of its intensity, Ms. McCormack said.She asked people to come forward if they have information on anyone who may have been in the tower at the time of the fire.Write to Wiktor Szary at Wiktor.Szary@wsj.comAppeared in the June 24, 2017, print edition as 'Fire Fears Trigger London Evacuation.'", "news_time": "2017-06-23 18:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/fire-safety-fears-lead-to-evacuation-of-more-londoners-1498254137", "news_title": "Fire Safety Fears Lead to Evacuation of Some Public Housing in London", "keywords": " cladding,grenfell fire, london fire,Camden borough council,affordable housing,political,general news,society,community,disasters,accidents,building fires,explosions,collapses,man-made disasters,social issues,welfare,social services"}, {"content": "The Supreme Court has made some large missteps on property rights in recent years (see Kelo v. City of New London) and on Friday it did it again. The Justices ruled 5-3 that adjacent parcels of land can be counted as a single piece of property, without any compensation to the owner for the change. Count that as a missed opportunity for the Court to brush back burdensome regulations that often amount to unconstitutional takings.Under the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment, property may not be taken by the government for public use without just compensation. In the 1990s four Murr siblings inherited two pieces of adjacent property that their parents had purchased in the 1960s. Ten years later, when the children sought to sell one of the lots, the sale was blocked by a 1975 zoning ordinance that counted the two properties as a single parcel.The pieces of land had been deeded and taxed separately, but that didn\u2019t sway the majority, written by       Anthony Kennedy       and joined by the four liberal justices. \u201cThe governmental action was a reasonable land-use regulation,\u201d Justice Kennedy wrote, \u201cenacted as part of a coordinated federal, state, and local effort to preserve the river and surrounding land.\u201d (Murr v. Wisconsin)The right to sell a piece of property seems fundamental, but the Court offered an exhausting list of considerations that state courts may consider while deciding whether a landowner should expect two adjacent properties to be treated separately or together. Among those, Justice Kennedy offered, are \u201cthe treatment of the land under state and local law; the physical characteristics of the land; and the prospective value of the regulated land.\u201d Oh, and also the \u201cbackground customs and the whole of our legal tradition.\u201d That really clears things up.In his dissent, joined by Justice       Samuel Alito       and Justice       Clarence Thomas,        Chief Justice       John Roberts       pays lip service to the reality of regulatory takings, noting that governments routinely \u201cinfringe private property interests for public use not only through appropriations, but through regulations as well. If compensation were required for one but not the other, \u2018the natural tendency of human nature\u2019 would be to extend regulations \u2018until at last private property disappears.\u2019\u201dBut Justice Roberts\u2019 dissent, like Justice Kennedy\u2019s opinion, wades more deeply through balancing tests than first principles. In a separate dissent, Justice Thomas gets it right. \u201cI join the Chief Justice\u2019s dissent because it correctly applies this Court\u2019s regulatory takings precedents, which no party has asked us to reconsider,\u201d he writes, \u201cThe Court, however, has never purported to ground those precedents in the Constitution as it was originally understood.\u201dThe Court has interpreted the Takings Clause to cover a \u201cdirect appropriation of property,\u201d Justice Thomas continues, but has fallen short in extending the law to the real loss of value inherent in the web of government regulations. Instead of digging in the weeds, Justice Thomas wrote, it would be good for the Court to \u201ctake a fresh look at our regulatory takings jurisprudence, to see whether it can be grounded in the original public meaning\u201d of the Constitution.

We welcome the riposte because the Blackstone Group founder helps us make the crucial policy distinction.\u201cAt Blackstone, contrary to your view,\u201d Mr. Schwarzman writes, \u201cwe have found that paid family leave isn\u2019t only smart policy, it\u2019s good for business.\u201d He says his company expanded paid maternity leave to 16 weeks from 12, and he says this has reduced turnover and supported a more loyal workforce.Bully for Blackstone, Steve. Employers and workers are free to negotiate compensation, and if Blackstone thinks even six months or a year of leave helps recruit and retain talent, then go for it. In a tight labor market, employers expand benefits to compete for workers, which is why a growing economy is the best antidote to inequality.But our point wasn\u2019t to oppose family leave. The editorial opposed a government plan to create a new spending entitlement through unemployment insurance, as the Trump Administration proposes. This would inevitably require higher payroll taxes or some other tax on business, especially when Democrats triple the leave benefits when they return to power.One irony is that a new entitlement could crimp what has been a decadeslong expansion of benefits by private business. If taxpayers will be subsidizing some minimum leave, many companies with thinner margins than Blackstone may see little point in broadening their own coverage.The left\u2019s reflex is that if something is good then the government ought to provide it, and some conservatives are falling into the left\u2019s political trap. As we\u2019re learning the hard way this year with ObamaCare and Medicaid, once an entitlement is in place it is nearly impossible to repeal.

Congress has tried for decades to fix the national flood insurance program, and the latest worthy attempt is coming from the House.The Financial Services Committee recently passed bills updating the Federal Emergency Management Agency\u2019s (FEMA) flood insurance program, which runs out of money on Sept. 30. The 1968 program insures more than $1 trillion in property, with about five million policies in 2016 for those who live in areas prone to flooding. The program is more than $24 billion in debt.One reason for the hole is that about 20% of policies are directly subsidized. More than 75% of such policies are in counties in the top 30% for home values, according to a Government Accountability Office analysis, and many dot the affluent coasts of Florida, California and Texas. In other words, this is a wealth transfer from low and middle-income families to the folks who own real estate on Nantucket.A 2012 law phased out subsidies when a home is sold to a new owner, among other improvements, though the real-estate lobby staged a meltdown. A Republican Congress repealed the measure in 2014 and instead hit all policy holders with a new surcharge.Financial Services Chairman Jeb Hensarling fought the repeal and is now pushing this rock up the hill again. A House bill from Rep.       Sean Duffy       (R., Wis.) would require 8% annual premium increases for certain policies, and premiums are supposed to be a proxy for liability.The bills force FEMA to raise collection rates for a reserve fund by 1% each year until there\u2019s more cash to weather the next Hurricane Sandy or other big payout, as law requires.The House bills also remove barriers to private competition. This would be great for families on the plains of Kansas, who subsidize policies in more risky areas. More alternatives also help reduce the federal balance sheet. One bill would remove a regulation that forbids a company from selling both government and private insurance instruments, and another would clarify that private insurance can meet standards for mortgages.Another good idea is shutting off the spigot for new subsidies. The House package would bar policies for certain expensive or risky new homes, effective 2021. FEMA would be required to disclose how the agency calculates premiums, and it would have to improve transparency and risk modeling for maps, which are closer to Lewis and       Clark\u2019s       trail guides than Google Earth.If these changes seem modest, they read like       Ayn Rand       compared with ideas in the Senate, where       Marco Rubio       (R., Florida Gold Coast) and       Elizabeth Warren       (D., Cape Cod) have teamed up to protect rich homeowners. Their plan would suspend interest on the program\u2019s debt, among other plugs. An open question is whether any improvement can pass the Senate Banking Committee, where Republicans with a one-vote majority will have to persuade Senator       John Kennedy       of flood-prone Louisiana.Congress will have to pass something by the fall or risk a lapse that disrupts the real-estate market. The best reform would be to convert the program into a private operation, though Members of both parties would pile together like sandbags to block it.

Friday won permission to buy a California mine that is the sole U.S. source of elements needed to make electronic devices.MP Mine Operations LLC, a company put together by Chicago hedge fund JHL Capital Group, New York\u2019s QVT Financial LP and Shenghe, was cleared by a bankruptcy judge to take over the Mountain Pass mine.An open-pit operation, the Mountain Pass mine was idled during the bankruptcy of its former owner, Molycorp Inc., and left behind in bankruptcy, with scant cash and no buyers.Less than a year after the bankruptcy trustee threatened to have Mountain Pass mine\u2019s case dismissed, it is to be sold for $20.5 million, a price that Judge       Christopher Sontchi       at Friday\u2019s court hearing in Wilmington, Del., called \u201can excellent result\u201d for an asset that had proved tough to sell.The mine itself and some equipment has been in the hands of the bankruptcy trustee. However,             Oaktree Capital                   Management, a large creditor that captured most of the Molycorp operation in bankruptcy, owns major equipment at the site. And the mineral rights belong to another company, which is also controlled by JHL.MP Mine is supposed to close the deal within weeks.Rival bidder       Tom Clarke,        a Virginia entrepreneur who has bought coal and iron-ore mines at bankruptcy auctions, didn\u2019t object to the sale. He dropped out of the Mountain Pass auction after the price hit $20 million.Mr. Clarke has been asking lawmakers to pay attention to the involvement of Shenghe, which said in a press release that it has put $50 million into MP Mine Operations.The Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. should review the deal for the mine, Mr. Clarke has said, because it is the only domestic source for rare earths, a crucial raw material largely controlled by China. CFIUS, an interagency federal government committee headed by the Department of the Treasury, looks at deals where foreign players control U.S. business operations that arouse national security or critical infrastructure concerns.At the June 14 auction, MP Mine\u2019s lawyer,       Matthew Clemente,        said the buyout group has a \u201cstrong belief\u201d that \u201cour transaction with our Chinese partner is not\u201d of the type that triggers CFIUS review. He described Shenghe as a minority investor.Mr. Clemente said MP Mine had shared its transaction documents with CFIUS and hadn\u2019t been asked to submit the deal for formal review. \u201cCFIUS is not an issue,\u201d he said, according to a transcript of the auction.Molycorp, which emerged from bankruptcy as the rare-earths processing company Neo Performance Materials, poured more than $1 billion into Mountain Pass at a time when prices for the elements were high.

Instead, courts should consider such factors as \u201cthe treatment of the land under state and local law; the physical characteristics of the land; and the prospective value of the regulated land,\u201d he wrote, joined by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer,       Sonia Sotomayor       and       Elena Kagan.The dispute involved a property along the Wisconsin bank of the St. Croix River, which has long been protected under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act. The question was whether two adjacent lots owned by the same family since the 1960s should be viewed as a single property or separate parcels.State and local law considered the parcels, which together had almost an acre of buildable land, merged since the 1990s, when they passed to four siblings in the Murr family.That became a problem for the Murrs years later, when they sought to sell one of the original parcels, known as Lot E, to pay for improvements on the other, Lot F. Regulations designed to prevent overdevelopment of the scenic area restricted sales of parcels smaller than a certain size. Lot E didn\u2019t qualify, and St. Croix County rejected the Murrs\u2019 application for a variance.The Constitution requires \u201cjust compensation\u201d when private property is \u201ctaken for public use.\u201d Under Supreme Court precedent, that provision can be triggered not only by outright seizures, but also when government regulations largely destroy a property\u2019s economic benefit to the owner.Represented by the Pacific Legal Foundation, a conservative advocacy group, the Murrs argued that the regulations should be viewed as affecting only Lot E\u2014and thereby amounted to a taking, because they left the property with almost no economic value.But that \u201capproach contravenes the court\u2019s case law, which recognizes that reasonable land-use regulations do not work a taking,\u201d Justice Kennedy wrote. \u201cThe governmental action was a reasonable land-use regulation, enacted as part of a coordinated federal, state and local effort to preserve the river and surrounding land.\u201d\u201cThis is an unfortunate decision for the Murrs, and all property owners,\u201d said John Groen, the Pacific Legal lawyer who argued the case. \u201cWe are disappointed that the court did not recognize the fundamental unfairness to the Murrs of having their separate properties combined, simply to avoid the protection of the Takings Clause.\u201dFor       Richard Lazarus,        a Harvard law professor who represented St. Croix County, the ruling marked a long-awaited turnabout. In 1992, he was on the losing side of Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council, when the late Justice Antonin Scalia expanded the concept of regulatory takings to rein in environmental laws.Friday\u2019s ruling was \u201ca clean, big win for government regulators and environmental protection. There\u2019s no nuance there,\u201d Mr. Lazarus said.Mr. Lazarus said the court adopted an approach environmentalists long have championed. \u201cYou don\u2019t just consider how the regulation reduces the economic value, but also how it may increase the property value by environmental protection,\u201d he said. \u201cThe reason these properties were worth as much as they were was because of these restrictions\u201d that prevented landowners from building \u201cin ways that would destroy the scenic vistas.\u201dIt also represented a triumph for Justice Kennedy. He had concurred with the outcome in the Lucas case, but wrote separately to argue that the majority\u2019s approach \u200bcould undercut government\u2019s ability to advance \u201cnew regulatory initiatives\u201d in response to changing conditions.In Friday\u2019s decision, Justice Kennedy repeatedly cited his own 1992 opinion, elevating it from a single-justice concurrence to a majority holding. \u201cCoastal property may present such unique concerns for a fragile land system that the state can go further in regulating its development and use,\u201d he wrote 25 years ago.Chief Justice       John Roberts,        joined by Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito dissented, but he acknowledged that the Murrs\u2019 argument might fail even under the narrower approach he was recommending, which focused primarily on using state-law definitions of parcel boundaries.\u201cThe majority presents a fair case that Murrs can still make good use of both lots, and that the ordinance is a commonplace tool to preserve scenic areas, such as the Lower St. Croix River, for the benefit of landowners and the public alike,\u201d Chief Justice Roberts wrote.Justice       Neil Gorsuch,        who was attending his confirmation hearing when the case was argued in March, did not participate in the decision.Write to Jess Bravin at jess.bravin@wsj.comAppeared in the June 24, 2017, print edition as 'Court Rebuffs Owner In Land-Use Ruling.'", "news_time": "2017-06-23 17:54:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-against-owner-in-land-use-case-1498254870", "news_title": "Supreme Court Rules Against Owner in Land-Use Case ", "keywords": " development issues, environmental land use, high court,land use, supreme court,Anthony Kennedy,political,general news,crime,legal action,natural environment,politics,international relations,domestic politics,regional politics,government bodies,judicial branch"}, {"content": "The Senate health bill\u2019s move to dump the mandate requiring people to have coverage would risk further destabilizing the strained individual-insurance market, insurers say, even though the legislation includes funding elements that the industry has been seeking.Insurers rushed\u00a0Friday\u00a0to assess the potential impact of the bill, which emerged as they are making decisions about their 2018 offerings for the marketplaces created by the Affordable Care Act. Already, several insurers have said they are pulling out of marketplaces for next year, with many others asking for rate increases of 20% or higher.Late\u00a0Thursday, a spokeswoman for Indiana\u2019s insurance regulator said the state appeared poised to have four counties that would lack exchange plans next year, joining an estimated 44 counties across Ohio, Washington and Missouri that are also at risk.Senate Republicans\u2019 bill has several items that have been on insurers\u2019 wish lists. For two years, it locks in the ACA\u2019s federal \u201ccost-sharing\u201d payments to insurers that help reduce health-care costs for low-income enrollees\u2014a move insurers have said is vital. The Trump administration has been threatening to halt those payments.It also promises two new buckets of funding\u2014one that goes to insurers and another to states\u2014that are aimed at steadying insurance markets.But the Senate legislation, like the Republican health bill that earlier passed the House, would effectively end the individual insurance mandate that many insurers say is important in prodding young, healthy people to enroll in plans. Those people help make the individual insurance market function, as they balance out the costs of sicker enrollees and help hold down premiums. Under the Senate bill, insurers would still be banned from refusing to sell people plans based on their health status, as is the case under the ACA.\u201cThe repeal of the individual mandate by itself creates enormous instability and probably leads to a death spiral,\u201d an insurance term describing when a market melts down as more and more healthy people leave and premiums rise, said       Chet Burrell,        chief executive of CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield.He called the funding aimed at bolstering the markets \u201ctoken money\u201d that, once divided among insurers across the country, would fall far short of what is needed to stabilize the markets. The bill includes $50 billion over four years in funding that would go to insurers, and an additional $62 billion over eight years that would go through states. If the Senate bill became law, his company wouldn\u2019t likely change its proposed rate increases for next year, which include a 52% hike in Maryland, he said.Many consumers\u2019 premiums are largely funded by federal subsidies under the ACA, but some people bear the full brunt of premium rises.Bernard J. Tyson,        the CEO of Kaiser Permanente, a major exchange insurer, said the cost-sharing payments and the stabilization funds were helpful moves but not enough to overcome the effect of dropping the insurance mandate. \u201cTaking away the individual mandate without clarity about what is going to replace it is destabilizing,\u201d he said. \u201cYou end up with a very unstable market because you\u2019re only in essence insuring the sick population.\u201dThe Blue Cross Blue Shield Association said it is \u201cencouraged that the draft Senate legislation funds cost-sharing reductions\u201d and approved the stability funding, but \u201cit is also critical that strong incentives for people to keep continuous coverage be included to ensure a balanced market that is affordable for everyone.\u201dAmerica\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, a health-insurance trade group, also approved the cost-sharing payments and stability funds, but a spokeswoman said, \u201cwe do need to address continuous coverage.\u201dOver a few years, the Senate bill would make other changes aimed at drawing younger people into the insurance markets. It would allow insurers to vary premiums according to age by a 5 to 1 ratio, up from 3 to 1, a change many insurers have supported. That would tend to push down costs for young people, while raising them for older people.Starting in 2020, the bill also rejiggers premium subsidies in a way that tends to favor young people. The subsidies would be tied to income and age, and also linked to geography, but within income brackets, older people would generally be required to contribute more than younger people toward their premiums.The bill also allows states to obtain waivers that could do away with a number of the ACA\u2019s requirements, such as covering 10 \u201cessential health benefits\u201d\u2014a shift that could allow for cheaper, less-robust plans.Speaking on the Senate floor Thursday, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Republicans \u201cagree on the need to stabilize the insurance markets\u201d that he said are \u201ccollapsing\u201d under the ACA.It isn\u2019t clear the bill\u2019s changes would truly \u201centice young people in,\u201d said Martin Hickey, chief executive of New Mexico Health Connections, a nonprofit insurer. He favors a coverage mandate like the ACA\u2019s but with a far steeper penalty. Also, he said, the bill\u2019s setup may discourage healthy older people, who could face higher costs, from enrolling.More broadly, insurers said that the long-term impact on the market is hard to gauge, partly because the legislation has so many moving parts, and some of the elements that are important next year will sunset in the future.For instance, subsidies that help lower-income people with costs like deductibles go away under the bill after 2019, and that may cause people to drop coverage, along with the changes to premium subsidies.But insurers said they worried because the stabilization money, which could help them with the cost of expensive, unhealthy enrollees, would ramp down in later years, removing a crutch to the marketplaces. One of the two buckets of money is apportioned over the first four years after the bill passes.The Senate bill \u201cdoes take some steps, but it overall is not likely to stabilize the market in the long term,\u201d said Tom Policelli, chief executive of nonprofit insurer Minuteman Health. \u201cIn the short term, it is trying to stabilize the market with cash.\u201d\u2014Stephanie Armour contributed to this article.Write to Anna Wilde Mathews at anna.mathews@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-23 17:48:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/insurers-fear-destabilized-markets-under-senate-bill-1498250805", "news_title": "Insurers Fear Destabilized Markets Under Senate Bill", "keywords": "regulation,government policy,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,society,community,health,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,upper house,welfare,social services,insurance,non-life insurance,medical insurance,financial services"}, {"content": "If you\u2019ve ever been to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, chances are that you visited the glass pavilion containing the Temple of Dendur. One of only three such temples outside Egypt, it was built by the       Roman emperor Augustus       around 10 B.C. as part of an effort to cultivate the local Nubian population. This month marks its 50th anniversary overlooking Central Park, where it provides an unforgettable glimpse of Egypt\u2019s ancient culture for millions of tourists who will never travel to the Middle East.But more important, at a time when the U.S. is questioning the nature of its longstanding relationships with countries across the world, the temple is a symbol of international cooperation. In the 1960s, 50 nations united to save 22 irreplaceable monuments\u2014including the Temple of Dendur\u2014set to be submerged during the construction of       Lake Nasser.       These countries were motivated not by their own national interests, but by an understanding that mankind has a common interest in protecting historic monuments.With a final investment of $16 million, the U.S. became the largest contributor to the $100 million preservation project. As a demonstration of gratitude, Egyptian President       Gamal Abdel Nasser       gave the Temple of Dendur to the U.S. in 1965. After a competition led by the newly created National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities, President       Lyndon Johnson       decided that the 2,000-year-old temple should go to the Met.The Middle East\u2019s fragile cultural heritage was in the news again this week. On Wednesday Islamic State blew up the historic Grand al-Nuri Mosque in Mosul, obliterating a cultural and religious site that had stood since 1173. Religious fundamentalism, illicit excavation, black-market trade and simple neglect have destroyed historic sites in the Middle East at an alarming rate. Wednesday\u2019s bombing underscores the most urgent problem: ISIS and its affiliates have turned cultural destruction in Iraq and Syria into propaganda, even as they sell looted works of art on the black market to raise money for arms.Why should we worry about a bunch of old monuments when the human cost of the unrest is so high? There are two reasons. First, the Middle East is the cradle of civilization. As our forebears recognized when they acted to save the cultural heritage of Lower Nubia, these monuments are integral to our collective human story. Architectural monuments illuminate the complexity of our common past. So much has already been lost. We have a moral obligation to save what remains.The second reason we should be concerned is simple pragmatism: A focus on history and heritage will be key to the eventual recovery of the Middle East. Cultural sites provide citizens with a sense of their value and self-identity beyond religious dogma. They also provide jobs, income and stability by attracting tourists. Iraq and Syria are home to some of the most significant sites in the history of civilization. It may be hard to conceive of a vacation in Damascus or Baghdad today, but travel to Vietnam would have been equally inconceivable 40 years ago. In 2017, Vietnam projects tourist revenue of $20 billion.Countries with economies tied to tourism are motivated to maintain peace and internal safety. Thus it is in the U.S. national interest to protect Middle Eastern heritage sites.Continuing conflicts across the region make modern preservation efforts more complicated than the drive to save the monuments threatened by Lake Nasser. Over the past year, Britain and France created funds to help protect and restore monuments in Middle Eastern conflict zones. Earlier this spring, the United Nations passed a resolution defining the destruction of historic monuments as a war crime, creating the basis for future intervention and criminal prosecution.This is all laudable and necessary preparation for a time when the region stabilizes. In the short term, local scholars and archaeologists, who often work in grave danger, may be the most effective avenue for aid. In late 2015, staff from the Met convened a conference in Istanbul for colleagues from museums in Syria and Iraq. They told us of their urgent need for basic photography and computer equipment to document collections that are at risk. In response, the Met developed portable documentation kits and sent them to these colleagues via Jordan. While this may sound like a drop in the bucket, it met an urgent need.This process of listening and responding to on-the-ground experts is both scalable and replicable. Governments and foundations should promote\u2014and fund\u2014similar collaborations. The U.S. government could certainly play a more active role than it has so far in this work.As we reflect on the effort that saved the Temple of Dendur, let\u2019s not be deterred by the sheer complexity of present-day challenges. One way or another, Iraq and Syria will have peace once again. For the sake of future generations, let\u2019s play our part in safeguarding the cultural heritage of the Middle East.Mr. Campbell is director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.Appeared in the June 24, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-06-23 17:45:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/islamic-state-wages-war-on-the-middle-easts-cultural-heritage-1498254299", "news_title": "Islamic State Wages War on the Middle East\u2019s Cultural Heritage", "keywords": "egypt,isis,islamic state,museums,temple of dendur,Metropolitan Museum of Art,art,political,general news,cultural heritage,national,public security,society,community,crime,legal action,arts,entertainment,politics,international relations,domestic politics,risk news,military action,commentaries,opinions"}, {"content": "Dreams have been haunting Haydar Butris. From his prison bed in Youngstown, Ohio, the 39-year-old has envisioned the Islamic State hacking his body with knives and beheading him. But waking doesn\u2019t end his nightmare. Barring a legal miracle, Mr. Butris will soon be deported to his native Iraq, a country he hasn\u2019t seen since he was a teenager.On June 11, Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents detained 114 Iraqi nationals. Like Mr. Butris, the vast majority are Chaldean Christians who came to the U.S. legally, then committed a crime that made them eligible for deportation. But if they\u2019re remanded to Iraq, they fear their faith could get them killed.\u201cWe\u2019re sending people back to a country their families fled from, and at all possible times, that\u2019s the worst place to go,\u201d says Mr. Butris\u2019s lawyer,       Clarence Dass,        who also represents 19 other Chaldeans. \u201cThis could be a death sentence.\u201dThe Chaldeans\u2019 plight is a particular challenge for the       Trump       administration, which has positioned itself as a defender of Middle Eastern Christians. But it could also pose a problem for progressives, who have long insisted religion must not be a factor in immigration policy.The administration has depicted the Detroit deportations as a critical safety measure. Immigration officials have said that the \u201coverwhelming majority\u201d of those being sent back to Iraq committed serious crimes, including murder, rape and kidnapping. The Detroit News reported this week that one of them,       Louis Akrawi,        is \u201ca convicted murderer who was known to police as the \u2018Godfather of the Chaldean Mafia,\u2019\u00a0\u201d and two others were his associates.But in many cases, Iraqi Christians committed nonviolent crimes decades ago, in the folly of youth. Mr. Butris was put on probation after delivering seven pounds of weed in 1998. In another case, a mother of three was convicted for misdemeanor fraud 14 years ago. Neither has been charged with a crime since.Until this year, the Iraqi government refused to take back immigrants, buying time for Chaldeans with criminal records. During that period, many have settled down, married their sweethearts, started businesses, and gotten involved in the church.Mr. Butris has two daughters, 12 and 9, and a 3-year-old son. All born in America. \u201cHis kids, they\u2019re devastated,\u201d Mr. Butris\u2019s brother,       Marty Mansor,        says. \u201cThey keep asking when their dad is going to come back. I don\u2019t know what to tell them.\u201dThe harsh truth: Deporting these Detroit Chaldeans to Iraq inherently exposes them to peril and persecution. Last month, Vice President       Mike Pence       accused Islamic State of carrying out genocide against Christians. \u201cOur administration is fully committed in bringing relief and comfort to believers not only across the Middle East but across the world,\u201d Mr. Pence said.And it\u2019s not just ISIS that threatens Iraqi Chaldeans. Last month, a cleric who oversees the government\u2019s Shia endowment fund publicly said Christians must convert to Islam and pay a tax \u201cor else they are killed.\u201d And just before Christmas, gunmen shot up Christian-owned shops in Baghdad, killing several people.A famed Baghdad vicar has since bemoaned that his faith will soon be extinct in his homeland. In 2003, roughly 1.5 million Christians lived in Iraq. Four-fifths of them have fled abroad.Progressives claim the Constitution bars the government from basing immigration and deportation decisions on religion. Yet so far it\u2019s been mainly progressives arguing for a reprieve for Detroit\u2019s Chaldeans, for whom \u201cthe risk is because of their religion,\u201d said       William Swor,        another Michigan attorney representing several Iraqi Christians.But if the Trump administration considers religion a factor for these Iraqi Christians, why shouldn\u2019t it do so for those affected by the so-called travel ban? And in that case, why not give Middle Eastern Christians priority over Muslims who are also seeking refugee status? The potential repercussions grow broad because U.S. law doesn\u2019t allow much discretion when it comes to the deportation of immigrants who have committed crimes.The Iraqi Chaldeans have three basic options: They can apply for relief under the U.N. Convention Against Torture, under which religious persecution can be a consideration; they can seek pardons for their original crimes; or, in some cases, they can ask for a reprieve based on \u201cexceptional and extreme hardship\u201d for their citizen spouses or children.In all three cases, the burden of proof is on the immigrant facing deportation. These near-immutable strictures constitute a harsh irony for Chaldeans, who may soon face persecution for adhering to a faith grounded in redemption.Both the Trump administration and its progressive opponents may find themselves yearning for a legal way to allow mercy to season justice. Otherwise, the case of the Iraqi Chaldeans is likely to have thorny implications, whether they stay or go.Ms. Melchior is Heat Street\u2019s political editor.Appeared in the June 24, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-06-23 17:43:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/detroits-iraqi-christians-could-use-some-mercy-from-washington-1498254204", "news_title": "Detroit\u2019s Iraqi Christians Could Use Some Mercy From Washington", "keywords": "chaldean christians,Immigration and Customs Enforcement,political,general news,national,public security,crime,legal action,migration,politics,international relations,terrorism,commentaries,opinions"}, {"content": "New YorkAngela Lee Duckworth       has just returned from her 25th class reunion at Harvard. \u201cPeople\u2019s lives really do turn out differently,\u201d she observes during an interview in a stylish boardroom. \u201cAnd it certainly can\u2019t be explained by how intelligent you remember them being when they were sitting next to you in organic chemistry class. Some of it is luck, some of it opportunity.\u201d And some of it is \u201cgrit,\u201d as Ms. Duckworth has told the world in articles, lectures and a 2016 bestselling book, \u201cGrit: The Power of Passion and Perseverance.\u201dIt\u2019s no hyperbole to talk about the 47-year-old University of Pennsylvania professor in international terms. More than eight million people have watched her 2013 TED talk on grit. That same year she won the renowned       MacArthur       \u201cGenius\u201d grant. U.S. and foreign government officials, CEOs and ordinary helicopter parents, teachers of every stripe, world-class coaches and award-winning researchers line up outside her office to pick her brain about how to make their employees, students, children or competitive swimmers grittier.She also runs a nonprofit, the Character Lab, with a staff of 12. Our interview took place immediately after the organization\u2019s board meeting\u2014hence the snazzy conference room. After 90 minutes of anecdotes, research citations and quotes\u2014Aristotle,       Nietzsche       and, unexpectedly, US Weekly\u2014my disarmingly laid-back but highly practiced interlocutor shows no signs of flagging.So what is this thing called grit, and why should we believe it is a key to success? \u201cI define grit as the tendency to pursue long-term goals with passion and persistence,\u201d she explains, echoing her book\u2019s subtitle. A close cousin of what personality psychologists call conscientiousness, grit deserves its own entry in the social-science lexicon, Ms. Duckworth insists: \u201cConscientiousness also includes self-control, orderliness, punctuality, responsibility.\u201dMs. Duckworth has her own 10-question test called the Grit Scale. She asked West Point cadets to take the test; those who scored higher were likelier to make it through the notoriously grueling \u201cBeast Barracks\u201d training. She also tested salespeople at a time-share company, Chicago public-school students and National Spelling Bee competitors, among others. High grit scores had the same predictive power for all of them. Persistence driven by passionate interest, she concluded after testing the various likely alternatives, predicts achievement in ways that neither conscientiousness nor IQ nor talent does.Ms. Duckworth came to her topic through a straightforward observation. \u201cI left management consulting to teach at a school on the Lower East Side before it got hip,\u201d she tells me. She then left New York and went on to a more affluent school in San Francisco. In the classroom, she noticed for the first time what she saw again at her Harvard reunion: The kids who seemed to have the greatest natural skill in, say, math, were often not the ones who aced the tests. Instead, the most dogged excelled. She wondered what makes resolute individuals tick\u2014if that lightning could be bottled for the benefit of the less tenacious.Those questions led her to graduate school in psychology at Penn and to a collector\u2019s enthusiasm for personal stories that might flesh out her intuition. She has amassed a gallery of portraits of \u201cparagons of grit\u2014leaders in business, art, athletics, journalism, academia, medicine and law.\u201d The list includes plenty of eye-catching luminaries:       Jeff Bezos,       Julia Child,        swimming gold-medalist       Rowdy Gaines,             New York Times                   crossword-puzzle master Will Shortz, Seattle Seahawks coach       Pete Carroll,        novelist       John Irving,        and       Francesca Martinez,        a British stand-up comic who was born with cerebral palsy.With its connotations of industriousness and can-do spirit, grit has an obvious American pedigree. Ms. Duckworth, the daughter of Chinese immigrants, grew up in Cherry Hill, N.J., a Philadelphia suburb. In graduate school, she came under the tutelage of the quintessentially American psychologist       Martin Seligman.       He is known as the father of positive psychology, the scientific study of human well-being, and the creator of \u201clearned optimism,\u201d the theory that people can learn to cultivate habits of happiness.Like Mr. Seligman, Ms. Duckworth is committed to the idea of human malleability, though she tempers her hopefulness with scientific caution. \u201cBoth explanations could be right\u201d and \u201cWe don\u2019t know yet\u201d are frequent asides in her writing and conversation.Ms. Duckworth has several thoughts about why parents and educators in particular have seized on grit as an answer to some of life\u2019s\u2014and the schools\u2019\u2014problems. \u201cIt\u2019s just speculation, but there may be a reaction to the focus on standardized tests, on ability and tests of ability and aptitude,\u201d she says. Grit offers parents a different way of thinking about their children\u2019s futures: \u201cIt\u2019s not just about your talent and ability, it\u2019s also about how much heart you put into it. Also, privileged parents worry their kids don\u2019t have enough grit\u2014the path has been smoothed for them.\u201dGrit also arrived at an opportune moment in American education. In the early 2000s, Ms. Duckworth was one of several researchers, among them the Nobel Prize-winning economist       James Heckman,        to find evidence that what have come to be known as \u201cnoncognitive skills\u201d or \u201csoft skills\u201d could have a profound impact on children\u2019s achievement.In 2012 the journalist       Paul Tough       popularized the new thinking in \u201cHow Children Succeed: Grit, Curiosity, and the Hidden Power of Character.\u201d That book\u2019s immense success boosted Ms. Duckworth\u2019s visibility. Around the same time, the rising charter-school movement was giving educators freedom to experiment with new ideas. Ms. Duckworth has worked closely over the years with       Dave Levin,        one of the founders of the celebrated KIPP schools and a co-founder of the Character Lab.The lab is an ambitious expansion of Ms. Duckworth\u2019s work on grit. Its mission is to \u201cadvance the science and the practice of character development.\u201d Her team, she says, relies on an \u201cinclusive definition of character from Aristotle: everything that allows a person to live a good life. Not just grit but gratitude; not just gratitude but curiosity, imagination, social and emotional intelligence, empathy, kindness, delayed gratification, self-control, growth mindset. The list is long.\u201d The lab has produced an abundance of papers and is now set to release its first \u201cToolkit,\u201d a collection of worksheets, lesson plans, research findings and videos on goal setting. Toolkits on other character traits are in the works.Ms. Duckworth has her share of detractors. Some on the right object that her theory of grit understates the role of IQ and innate talent. Progressives say she downplays structural barriers. They hear familiar accusations that the less successful suffer from deficient character instead of the cruelties of racism and economic injustice. \u2018\u2018The more we focus on whether people have or lack persistence (or self-discipline more generally), the less likely we\u2019ll be to question larger policies,\u201d the left-wing author       Alfie Kohn       wrote in the Washington Post.The critique that hit Ms. Duckworth hardest was a meta-analysis by Iowa State University psychologist       Marcus Crede       and two coauthors. The team concluded that grit did not predict success nearly as well as other characteristics, such as cognitive ability and study habits, and called grit \u201cold wine in new bottles,\u201c barely distinguishable in experiments from conscientiousness.Worse, the researchers accused Ms. Duckworth of a \u201cstatistical misunderstanding\u201d about the strength of effects she claimed to find. Though the paper didn\u2019t seem to damage grit\u2019s status in the general public, Ms. Duckworth reacted with characteristic determination. \u201cAfter the Crede article came out, I wrote a letter to myself,\u201d she says. \u201cI never showed it to anyone or published it. It was just so I could sleep at night.\u201dShe quickly offered to send it to me. The methodological disputes it outlines are best left to the experts, but its highly technical nature points to two related problems inherent in grit, and by extension in the practical ambitions of the Character Lab. First, character may well be malleable, but no one has discovered a formula for teaching grit, much less curiosity or imagination, in the classroom. And even if those traits were being taught, how would we know? Large education systems need accountability. Getting a precise measure of a student\u2019s progress in math or reading comprehension is hard enough; a large testing industry is devoted to tweaking the problem. Imagine trying to measure empathy or self-control with scientific rigor.The fundamental question for the Character Lab, and the soft-skills field more generally, is whether Aristotelian virtues can be dragged into the same intellectual arena as scientific surveys and regression analyses. Can social science and pop psychology fully embrace a tradition-soaked concept like character, grounded as it is in culture, history and custom? For that matter, can educators successfully cultivate self-control, resilience and curiosity in a culture of trigger warnings, social media and chaotic domestic lives? In other words, in a culture that nourishes precisely the opposite of character?Ms. Duckworth appreciates at least some of these concerns. Fans frequently write her with ideas for teaching grit that she finds off the mark. There are some who get closer to the real thing: \u201cI\u2019ve met individual teachers and coaches, who write to me\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0and have translated the scientific research into practice in very beautiful and creative ways. What I haven\u2019t found is a school or district that has figured out how to do that at scale.\u201dShe is committed to scientific rigor yet impatient with contemporary academic specialization that gets bogged down in arcane turf distinctions. \u201cWe are all supposed to be studying human nature,\u201d she observes. \u201cSome teachers are more comfortable calling character \u2018social-emotional learning,\u2019\u00a0\u201d she acknowledges. \u201cI like the word. I hope that\u2014maybe this is immodest\u2014Character Lab could help the American public to understand that the meaning is very broad and not religious in connotation, to carry no judgment, to connote something that is worth working for.\u201dMs. Hymowitz is a fellow at the Manhattan Institute and author, most recently, of \u201cThe New Brooklyn: What It Takes to Bring a City Back.\u201dAppeared in the June 24, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-06-23 17:43:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/is-there-anything-grit-cant-do-1498254238", "news_title": "Is There Anything Grit Can\u2019t Do?", "keywords": "grit,Angela Lee Duckworth,commentaries,opinions,interviews"}, {"content": "From       Rich Lowry\u2019s       syndicated column, June\u00a021:There\u2019s no doubt that Democrats want to watch TV programs that excoriate the president.

Good luck with that.Hodgkinson looks more and more like a typical mass shooter, for whom going on a spree is a way to escape responsibility for his unraveling life, the factor that explains so many workplace shooters over the years (which is how this business column got interested).Progress is possible without the pie-in-the-sky dream of ending private gun ownership in a society accustomed to private gun ownership. Businesses, led by the pioneering U.S. Postal Service, knocked down workplace homicides by two-thirds since 1993, according to the National Center for Victims of Crime. And not by turning every office into a fortress, but rather by understanding who their workers are and paying attention to the threats they mutter.Let\u2019s face it, with big data, with impersonal algorithms that could track every earthly resident\u2019s web activity, travels, purchases and electronic interactions with the world, it might be quite possible to know whose life and personality are disintegrating, who might seek to resolve the impasse by going on murder binge.We don\u2019t doubt that if Google,             Facebook,Microsoft                   and Amazon decided tomorrow morning to collaborate on a \u201cmass shooter project,\u201d in about a month they could produce an interesting list of pre-crime suspects.Yes, there would be false positives. You need false positives to refine the algorithms.Pile on smart surveillance cameras, which not only see but interpret: The potential is inherent in digital technology; it\u2019s already being used (Google the words \u201cpredictive crime analytics\u201d); it will have to be dealt with intelligently sooner or later.How the \u201cpre-crime\u201d era of law enforcement will finally be accepted also seems fairly easy to predict. For better or worse, voters will give their permission only when and if domestic terrorism reaches levels experienced in the U.K. or France. Meanwhile, the lone American who, from non-Islamist motives, decides to shoot a bunch of his fellow citizens is a problem we will be living with. But there\u2019s still hope.

Your humble correspondent wrote that \u201cit\u2019s not that voters oppose the Russia investigation; they just don\u2019t think it will solve their problems.\u201d But now comes a report from The Hill published on Friday:This column is hoping readers will conclude that Thursday\u2019s edition wasn\u2019t an example of fake news when it claimed that voters don\u2019t oppose a Russia inquiry, but simply a story that may have been overtaken by events. Also, the Harvard study is just one opinion survey and as The Hill notes, \u201cother surveys have found strong support for the special counsel investigating the Russia probe. A Harvard-Harris poll released last month found 75 percent support for former FBI Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation.\u201dBut let\u2019s assume for the moment that the new Harvard study is an accurate reading of current public sentiment. This seems plausible as Democrats increasingly conclude that they must focus more on jobs and the economy in their communications with voters. Partly driving this conclusion is the unhappy experience of       Jon Ossoff,        who found that Georgia voters cared less about collusion claims than did California donors.If anywhere close to 64% of U.S. voters believe that Russia investigations are hurting the country, this suggests that not only is the Russia story not a liability for the President\u2014it\u2019s an issue on which he enjoys one of his greatest advantages over Democrats. Perhaps Mr. Trump should consider ordering Deputy Attorney General       Rod Rosenstein       to appoint more special counsels.On a more serious note, if all the Russia talk turns out to benefit the President, it also raises the question of whether most of us media folk have blown yet another big call on Donald Trump. The conventional view among people who work in large news organizations\u2014and even it seems among many people who work for the President\u2014is that Mr. Trump\u2019s use of             Twitter                   is a liability. Many view the Trump feed as a series of ill-advised outbursts resulting from a lack of self-control and political discipline. This column has urged Mr. Trump to especially avoid tweeting about matters under investigation. But if he\u2019s actually winning the Russia argument, the conventional media view will need to be reappraised.Various readers have made the case that Mr. Trump\u2019s use of media, including Twitter, is almost always a calculated effort, sometimes intended to persuade and sometimes simply intended to create controversies to divert the attention of media and political opponents away from Mr. Trump\u2019s real priorities. This column remains skeptical, but is now less confident in the position.The debate continues over how much damage Mr. Trump is doing to his presidency\u2014or how large a benefit he is creating\u2014by persisting in firing out 140-character bursts on the political news of the day. But there should be no argument that when he ventures outside the world of politics, he\u2019s among the world\u2019s most entertaining observers of popular culture. Mr. Trump could avoid political risk and possibly win over some new fans by using social media exclusively to offer commentary on music, sports and filmed entertainment.

If successful, the new court efforts would compel local authorities to assist federal immigration officers whether they want to or not.Separately, on Friday the Justice Department filed papers in support of the state of Texas\u2019 defense in federal court of one of the toughest anti-illegal immigration laws in the nation. The statute, which is set to take effect in September, prohibits Texas cities and police departments from limiting their cooperation with federal immigration authorities.Under that law, local Texas law-enforcement officials and sheriffs can face criminal penalties\u2014including jail sentences\u2014if they don\u2019t comply with requests from federal authorities to detain suspected illegal immigrants until they can be transferred to Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody.Many cities and counties in Texas and across the country have adopted policies of not honoring these requests, called detainers. Several Texas cities, including Houston, Dallas, Austin, San Antonio and El Paso, challenged the law, saying it unconstitutionally infringes on the rights of local governments to police their own residents.The Justice Department argues the Texas statute doesn\u2019t improperly pre-empt federal law or violate the Constitution. It plans to make those points in oral arguments in federal court in San Antonio Monday.\u201cThe Department of Justice fully supports Texas\u2019 effort and is participating in this lawsuit because of the strong federal interest in facilitating the state and local cooperation that is critical in enforcing our nation\u2019s immigration laws,\u201d Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement.Next week, Republicans will work to advance a similar goal via legislation. The House plans a vote on a measure that would deny certain federal grants from jurisdictions that don\u2019t honor detainers, among other provisions.In April, a federal judge in San Francisco ruled that Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order threatening to pull funding from so-called sanctuary cities is likely unconstitutional.Separately, the Justice Department is developing legal strategies to invalidate sanctuary-city policies across the nation, according to several people familiar with the work under way.The goal, officials said, would be to win court rulings clarifying local jurisdictions\u2019 requirements under federal law, effectively forcing them to abandon policies of not cooperating with federal officials.That strategy is complicated by the fact that the Justice Department has already said that detainers are requests of local authorities, not requirements.But the Justice Department is weighing a range of legal theories.A senior Justice Department attorney laid out the options under discussion. One possibility is to argue that local policies prohibiting cooperation with ICE wrongly pre-empt federal immigration law. Under another option, the department would argue that local authorities are discriminating against ICE because they are willing to honor detainers issued by other federal agencies such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation or the Drug Enforcement Administration. A third theory would argue that local governments are obstructing the federal government\u2019s ability to do its job.The Justice Department attorney said a straightforward case arguing that local governments are required to honor detainers would likely succeed in front of some federal judges but not others. The official said the department is considering which circuits present the friendliest terrain. He added that as President Donald Trump puts more people onto the federal bench, the department\u2019s chances may improve in certain circuits.Still, the official said, the Justice Department wants to ensure that any case its lawyers file could pass muster with the Supreme Court.A more limited option, the official said, would be to argue that a federal statute requiring open communication between local and federal officials, known as Section 1373, requires that local officials inform ICE when a suspected illegal immigrant is about to be released. Alternatively, the official said, the Justice Department could file a suit aimed at forcing local jails to let ICE officers into their facilities to investigate whether foreign-born suspects are citizens.Immigrant activists are skeptical that these suits would succeed. Greg Chen, director of government relations for the American Immigration Lawyers Association, says Section 1373 is narrowly written merely to bar localities from prohibiting their personnel from sharing information about citizenship or immigration status with the federal authorities.\u201cThe language is specific and limited,\u201d he said.Mr. Chen said he would need to know more about other legal theories under consideration to comment on how those suits might be defended. But he said most places that decline to honor detainers do so because of court decisions that have found localities can be held liable for wrongly detaining someone without probable cause to believe the person should be kept.In addition, he said, many communities have concluded that they don\u2019t want their law-enforcement officials seen as agents of federal immigration law, for fear that crime victims and witnesses would not come forward.\u201cBy trying to force localities to honor these detainers, the federal government is putting localities between a rock and a hard place,\u201d he said.In April, a federal judge in San Francisco ruled that Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order threatening to pull funding from so-called sanctuary cities is likely unconstitutional.\u2014Dan Frosch contributed to this article.Write to Laura Meckler at laura.meckler@wsj.comCorrections & Amplifications   The Justice Department on Friday filed papers in support of Texas\u2019 defense of its anti-illegal immigration law.

The doubled meanings of poetry are at most \u201cchordal.\u201d But music is polyphonic. The best a lyric can do is attune itself to its musical counterpoint\u2014as in Cole Porter\u2019s \u201cEv\u2019ry Time We Say Goodbye,\u201d when the lyrics \u201cchange from major to minor\u201d and the harmony shifts ominously.Just such a strange change recurs in Jimmy Webb\u2019s \u201cWichita Lineman,\u201d a hit for Glen Campbell in 1968. The lineman broods on his connection to a woman he loves but cannot have. \u201cI hear you singin\u2019 in the wire, / I can hear you through the whine.\u201d Mr. Webb reharmonizes that slide with a chromatic bass counterpoint as Porter had done in \u201cNight and Day,\u201d another song in which obsession distorts familiar song structures and chord sequences. The lineman ends up suspended over an unresolved chord, \u201cstill on the line,\u201d static atop a telegraph pole, caught in emotional torment.By Jimmy WebbSt. Martins, 346 pages, $26.99Mr. Webb, then 21, wrote \u201cWichita Lineman\u201d in a few hours, because Glen Campbell had asked for \u201csomething geographical\u201d to follow \u201cBy the Time I Get to Phoenix,\u201d the Webb composition that the singer rode to No. 2 on the charts in 1967. By 1968, the year Richard Harris recorded the songwriter\u2019s symphonic \u201cMacArthur Park,\u201d Mr. Webb was \u201cThe Cole Porter of the Sixties,\u201d according to some of the press coverage of the day. He drove a 427 Shelby Cobra. He owned an old \u201cValleywood\u201d mansion. Frank Sinatra covered his songs, and Caesar\u2019s Palace was offering him eight-week engagements at $40,000 apiece, white piano included.Mr. Webb wanted to be a rock star, not a studio hand. He wanted the cars, the fame, the money, the girls. He also wanted the esteem of his songwriter contemporaries, even though most of them seem to have thought that a musical score meant buying drugs at a recording session. \u201cThe Cake and the Rain\u201d is the story of how Mr. Webb made it and how unmaking it nearly killed him. It is novelistic, perfectly plotted and quite possibly the best pop-star autobiography yet written.A writer can approximate musical counterpoint by restructuring the timeline. Anthony Burgess\u2019s \u201cNapoleon Symphony\u201d (1974), a novel of Bonaparte\u2019s life, imitates the structure and non-linear narrative of Beethoven\u2019s Third. Mr. Webb avoids the linear narrative of pop biography and structures \u201cThe Cake and the Rain\u201d like \u201cWichita Lineman.\u201d The song has two sections, each leading from narrative to refrain. The book has two threads, the rise and the fall. The Devil recurs in Mr. Webb\u2019s story as a living presence.Mr. Webb\u2019s grandfather, Charlie, was said to be the seventh son of a seventh son. The religious call came to his father, Robert, while astride a tractor in Texas. He became an itinerant Baptist preacher, dragging his wife, Ann, and his children to \u201cone-horse\u201d congregations and \u201cplaster-on-chicken-wire\u201d tract homes. Jimmy discovered the Devil\u2019s music secretly, between the sheets with a transistor radio. In Oklahoma City, an older woman taught him the piano: exercises from the Baptist Hymnal, but also improvisation, arrangement and substitution, which creates new counterpoint through \u201cthe alchemy of substituting exotic and unfamiliar chords for more prosaic ones.\u201dIn 1963, the family reached Southern California. A year later, Mr. Webb\u2019s mother died of a brain tumor. His father returned to Texas, but 18-year-old Jimmy stayed. He was in unrequited love with California pop, which he wanted to write and record, as well as its blond incarnation, Suzy Horton, \u201cthe most bitchin\u2019 girl in the school.\u201d His father gave him $40 and a warning: \u201cThis songwriting thing is just going to break your heart, son.\u201d Mr. Webb dropped out of college and began recording the songs he had been composing. The first hits, \u201cDidn\u2019t We?\u201d (recorded by Richard Harris) and \u201cUp, Up and Away\u201d (for the 5th Dimension), came almost overnight. His collaboration with Glen Campbell made him a star.In the era of Vietnam, youth revolt and \u201cAll You Need Is Love,\u201d Mr. Webb was \u201cembarrassed and a little guilty\u201d about his wealth, his apolitical lyrics and Sinatra\u2019s approval. At the Monterey Festival of 1967, he had seen that the \u201cold craft and traditions\u201d were slipping into an \u201cabyss\u201d of \u201cear-busting rock \u2019n\u2019 roll.\u201d He jumped anyway. \u201cI want to be an artist,\u201d Mr. Webb told David Geffen, a Mephistopheles bearing a recording contract, in 1970. The author befriends Harry Nilsson and becomes a cokehead. He spends $250,000 on tape players so that a live show can duplicate his studio sound but omits to ask the musicians\u2019 union if he can substitute tapes for its members.

He \u201ckidnaps\u201d Suzy Horton in a private jet, whisks her to Hawaii and finally seduces her after giving her LSD or, as the Beatles\u2019 publicist Derek Taylor called it, \u201cthe old dreaded heaven and hell.\u201d Then he takes to the road in a mock-Jagger leather suit and cheats on her.The Devil has the best anecdotes. The mescaline not having worn off, Mr. Webb greets the King with \u201cHowdy, El!\u201d Later, Elvis asks how many French horns he uses on his recordings. It used to be three, Mr. Webb says, but that wasn\u2019t enough: Nelson Riddle used four on Sinatra\u2019s recordings. \u201cOkay, Jimma, that seems about right to me too.\u201d (Sadly, the two never collaborated.) The roguish, broguish Richard Harris invites \u201cJimmywebb\u201d to stay at Cotchford Farm, where Christopher Robin lived and Brian Jones died. The cuckolded songwriter Leslie Bricusse throws himself across the hood of the author\u2019s Corvette as Mr. Webb elopes with Mr. Bricusse\u2019s wife. Mia Farrow, unsure if she can play Peter Pan in producer Mel Ferrer\u2019s movie, suggests using a young boy she had seen on \u201cThe Ed Sullivan Show\u201d with the Jackson Five. Mr. Webb plays it deadpan: \u201cHis name was Michael. He would make a perfect Pan.\u201dShow business is the devil\u2019s work. Mr. Webb sleeps under the piano as he slaves for days on \u201cMacArthur Park,\u201d the seven-minute epic whose cryptic lyrics give the book its title: \u201cSomeone left the cake out in the rain / I don\u2019t think that I can take it / \u2019Cause it took so long to bake it / And I\u2019ll never have that recipe again.\u201d Richard Harris records the vocal while swilling from \u201ca giant, chilled pitcher of Pimm\u2019s No. 1.\u201d He keeps singing \u201cMacArthur\u2019s Park\u201d\u2014as though \u201ca fellow named MacArthur owned the park.\u201d Mr. Webb and his engineer collect \u201cfavored lines and passages\u201d on a multitrack recorder, then edit down word by word.One day in 1973, Mr. Webb crashes a glider into a pine ridge in California. His passenger, the rock photographer Henry Diltz, is \u201cbloodied but not bloody dead,\u201d but the joint in Mr. Diltz\u2019s top pocket is intact. \u201cWe fired up the splif and inhaled deeply. . . . Far above was the snow-crowned summit of Baden-Powell, the sun plummeting toward the west, the long shadows reaching out for us.\u201dSoon afterward, Nilsson and Mr. Webb mistake PCP for cocaine. Nilsson crawls around on all fours, repeating, \u201cZardoz, Zardoz\u201d\u2014the name of a Sean Connery film \u201cwhere old age is dispensed as a punishment.\u201d Mr. Webb goes to Hell. Passing from \u201cthe realm of demons\u201d to \u201ca bleak, dark plain under a starless sky,\u201d his personality breaks into point and counterpoint: \u201cThere were two of me. One suffered the most outrageous fear and insult while the other watched, calm and unsympathetic.\u201d For a month, everything feels like rubber\u2014even the piano keys. He cannot remember \u201ca single tune or chord.\u201d When he eventually strikes a Middle C, he cries. Born again, it seems, he plays \u201cAmazing Grace.\u201d And there this story ends. Mr. Webb, expert at extracting drama from form, ends his narrative with this quiet yet resonant coda.No one writes songs like Jimmy Webb does, and no musician ever wrote a biography like this. \u201cThe Cake and the Rain\u201d is a dream of sin and redemption, told with contrapuntal rigor. And, yes, Mr. Webb explains the lyrics of \u201cMacArthur Park\u201d too.\u2014Mr. Green is a historian, critic and jazz musician.", "news_time": "2017-06-23 16:36:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/jimmy-webbs-rise-and-fall-1498250196", "news_title": "Jimmy Webb\u2019s Rise and Fall", "keywords": "bookcar0624,book review,books,political,general news,celebrities,arts,entertainment,living,lifestyle,music,reviews"}, {"content": "Bars, bottoms and bluster make for great bulges of black humor in the novels of the prolific Congolese writer       Alain Mabanckou.       His novels may switch back and forth between the immigrant neighborhoods of Paris and the Congo-Brazzaville port of Pointe-Noire\u2014the city of his childhood, which he has almost singlehandedly put on the map of world literature\u2014but the moods and voices that linger after the careering details rendered up by his limber and musical prose have faded away have a common aspect.No matter which continent he sets up on, his fictional universe is populated by a cast of lowlifes, hustlers and palaverers, usually including a male master of ceremonies who toggles chirpily between their stories and his own. Mr. Mabanckou\u2019s characters are often defined by nicknames, one-word gateways into how they have learned to organize the world or snapshots of the droll specialties they have cultivated.Buttologist, the hero of \u201cBlack Bazaar\u201d (2009), has earned his moniker because he is convinced that \u201cyou can understand human psychology from the way people shift their rear-ends.\u201d Broken Glass, the eponymous narrator of another novel (2005), evokes with his name both what happens every night at a bar, and a chronicler who makes a world from the shards of reminiscence of a small society of bibulous customers. In fact, Broken Glass serves as a model for Mr. Mabanckou himself, a writer who wants his readers to feel that they are not so much reading a book as listening to a chorus of blatherers on bar stools.By Alain MabanckouNew Press, 199 pages, $23.95\u201cBlack Moses,\u201d the latest work in a burgeoning oeuvre\u2014Mr. Mabanckou has published more than half a dozen novels since the turn of the millennium, as well as an homage to       James Baldwin       and a memoir of childhood\u2014slides down from Pointe-Noire into Loango, a village some 12 miles away. Here exists a small orphanage of 300 sad children, divided into girls and boys and united in an existence of shared solitude and stultifying routine, all presided over by a draconian bureaucracy that could have been imported straight out of Dickens.Out of this mass pops the narrator-protagonist, age 13, who was found outside the orphanage, wrapped in a white sheet, when only a few days old. Black Moses owes his name to the one source of pleasure and consolation in his life, the priest Papa Moupelo. Although no more than a weekly visitor to the school, much resented by his grumpy and stony-hearted colleagues, Moupelo\u2019s infectious Bible-fired rhetoric and ready affection make him \u201cthe spiritual father of all us children who\u2019d never known their biological father.\u201dWhen the Congolese regime, under the influence of the Soviet Union, suddenly embraces \u201cscientific socialism\u201d and interdicts religious teaching, the ripples reach all the way down to Loango. Papa Moupelo is summarily dismissed\u2014the first in a set of departures in Moses\u2019s sentient life that reprise the abandonment with which he began life in the world. The wards are now made to rehearse socialist doctrine, adding another layer of bewilderment to an already puzzling existence and a skein of satire to Mr. Mabanckou\u2019s story.The first-person narration in this long section is a somewhat uneasy blend of boarding-school drama joined up to excurses on Congolese social life and ethnic tensions; the reader feels the point of view blur between that of the boy Moses and the adult who looks back upon boyhood. Eventually, Moses contrives an escape from the orphanage and arrives in Pointe-Noire. There he joins a street gang and gets himself the attribute that in Mr. Mabanckou\u2019s universe signifies full personhood: a nickname, \u201cLittle Pepper.\u201d (The French original of this novel was published, in 2015, as \u201cPetit Piment.\u201d)Further on, Little Pepper ingratiates himself with Maman Fiat 500, the owner of a brothel, and becomes an errand boy for her establishment. When the good Maman and her business are eviscerated by a corrupt politician\u2019s clean-up drive, Little Pepper is orphaned once more\u2014and this time it is too much for him. \u201cAfter that, nothing. I remembered nothing, not even who I was.\u201dIt is here, for the first time in the book, that Mr. Mabanckou\u2019s narration rings with a beautiful poetry, notes not on a madcap world but a private universe of genuine madness and misanthropy. (The translation is by the distinguished English writer       Helen Stevenson.      ) Little Pepper has retreated to a hut on the banks of a river, where he lives like Thoreau in the company of trees and thoughts. \u201cSometimes I\u2019d just sit the whole day long in my vegetable plot,\u201d he says, \u201choping to catch my spinach plants growing.\u201d His noble if futile quest is further dignified by an equally dotty neighbor, who compares him to the sower found in ancient books \u201cwhose tall dark silhouette o\u2019ercasts the fields, his heart set on the fruit of passing time.\u201dUnfortunately, this is as good as things get in \u201cBlack Moses.\u201d Little Pepper is shepherded back into the world and his disordered brain subjected to the attentions of doctors both Western and African. Several episodes seem like sketches, with conversations going on long after the point of the scene\u2014usually mutual incomprehension\u2014has been established. As a result, Little Pepper\u2019s final, redemptive act of violence\u2014one that recalls the protagonist of Mr. Mabanckou\u2019s \u201cAfrican Psycho\u201d (2003), who is spellbound by the idea of realizing himself by killing somebody\u2014has an inevitability but not a fullness about it.One could argue that with \u201cBlack Moses\u201d Mr. Mabanckou has exhausted the possibilities of a certain scattershot narrative method. Despite the promise of the material, he often cannot prevent his storytelling here from lapsing into mere mannerism. The confessional first-person narration, the walk-on monologues of minor characters, the slangy dialogue sprinkled with exclamation marks, all seem a little hungover. Perhaps the next step in this accomplished writer\u2019s journey should be one away from, rather than toward, Mabanckou-ness.\u2014Mr. Choudhury is the author of the novel \u201cArzee the Dwarf.\u201d His second novel, \u201cClouds,\u201d will be published next year.", "news_time": "2017-06-23 16:34:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-congolese-coming-of-age-1498250073", "news_title": "A Congolese Coming-of-Age", "keywords": "bookcar0624,book review,books,political,general news,arts,entertainment,reviews"}, {"content": "Drawing creatures and colors from the natural world, Cynthia Rylant and       Brendan Wenzel       invite 4- to 9-year-olds to appreciate the wonder of existence with \u201cLife\u201d (Beach Lane, 40 pages, $17.99). \u201cLife begins small.

Leonard Weisgard\u2019s       pictures here are flat, angular, even crude, with hard primary colors and lots of black and white. That may sound unappealing, but with Brown\u2019s droll, direct writing, the effect is felicitous: The pictures are as \u201cnoisy\u201d as the sounds that poor little Muffin the dog, temporarily blinded by a \u201cgreat big white bandage,\u201d tries to puzzle out through the pages.

Many of the controversies surrounding video games have to do with this self-conscious stage of development, just as they did when people worried that kids were spending too much time in front of the TV or, in centuries past, too much time reading books. Video games are where teenagers escape to explore fantasies, test their mental prowess and perform heroic deeds. \u201cIn EverWhen he was a healer and an Elvish prince, a leader of his company,\u201d       Allegra Goodman       writes about Aidan, a skinny, introverted 16-year-old in her novel \u201cThe Chalk Artist\u201d (Dial, 335 pages, $27). But Aidan\u2019s overworked single mother hates the game because when he enters its virtual realm, she can\u2019t follow after him.Aidan is one of a constellation of characters struggling to harmonize their dreams and desires with the actualities of the outside world. Nina is an heiress to the Arkadia video game franchise, which created EverWhen, but she\u2019s determined to cut her own path teaching English literature at Aidan\u2019s high school in Cambridge, Mass. Her boyfriend, Collin, an unmoored artist with a genius for sketching in chalk, decorates the sidewalks of Harvard Square. She gets him a job as an illustrator for Arkadia only to see him become consumed by the insular gaming culture that has so ensorcelled her students.The seductions and consolations of gaming life have inspired a number of recent novels, most popularly       Ernest Cline\u2019s       \u201cReady Player One\u201d (2011). Like Aidan\u2019s mother, however, Ms. Goodman takes a wholly negative view of the pastime. Her plot turns on a rogue marketing campaign by an Arkadia staffer who uses sexual wiles and an unreleased EverWhen sequel to manipulate Aidan into vandalizing his school with gamer terminology. Aidan becomes so addicted to playing that his twin sister has to hide his console, like someone confiscating vodka bottles from the family drunk. Later his mother smashes the thing with a hammer, then slumps into a chair \u201cwith a long, shuddering sigh\u201d of parental catharsis.\u201cThe Chalk Artist\u201d offers antidotes to this apparent technological scourge. Nina and Collin enjoy a highly symbolic stroll in Walden Woods and Nina\u2019s classroom efforts go toward awakening her students to the glories of       Emily Dickinson.       But though there\u2019s undeniable charm in Ms. Goodman\u2019s celebration of nature and poetry, the novel\u2019s moral binary feels superficial. Characterizing video games as little more than digital opiates leaves Aidan\u2019s coming-of-age story frustratingly underdeveloped.Partly this is the fault of imbalances in the plot. The book\u2019s title refers to Collin, but the guy\u2019s an earnest bore (\u201cMy art\u2019s not deep,\u201d he says, accurately), and the fate of his relationship with Nina is decidedly low-stakes. The real intrigue is with Aidan. The immersive, collaborative worlds of his role-playing games, with their elements of questing, violence and sexual ideation, form a powerful backdrop to the shocks of adolescence. A novel that appreciated the complexity of these games would tell a darker but more truthful story about growing up in contemporary America. Instead, Ms. Goodman has written a feel-good fantasy about kicking a bad habit with help from the Belle of Amherst.A poem of Emily Dickinson\u2019s provides the title to       Ann Beattie\u2019s       \u201cThe Accomplished Guest\u201d (Scribner, 270 pages, $26), a phrase that refers to a spirit or muse that takes residence in the soul but that in Ms. Beattie\u2019s modest usage also describes the many visitors who populate her more recent short stories. In \u201cCompany\u201d an aging professor hosts former students at his Maine summer house, but the invasion of cheerful youth makes him feel as close to death as the lobsters being boiled for dinner. In \u201cOther People\u2019s Birthdays\u201d a woman travels to see her parents and emotionally unstable sister, a trip that culminates in a bloody wrestling scrum on the front porch prompted by a withheld present.These are busy, gregarious stories, more active and unbuttoned than the so-called Minimalist writing that defined Ms. Beattie\u2019s heyday in the 1980s, but still possessed of her eye for quirky relationships and her sidelong sense of humor. The funniest tales are what one character labels \u201cvery Key West\u201d stories. \u201cThe Debt\u201d follows the road trip of three college friends who mean to confront a man who lost their money in a business scam but get themselves in far deeper trouble at a nearby brothel. \u201cHoodie in Xanadu\u201d is a memorably odd portrait of the friendship between a widowed flower designer and an overweight agoraphobic Key Wester who rents his gorgeously appointed sitting room to party-throwing celebrities. To her surprise, the old woman finds what most of the nomadic characters in this pleasing collection wish they had: \u201cA partner on a night when foxes sang and danced in the moonlight, and the old people sat and stared.\u201dSociety\u2019s darkest impulses are on graphic display in       Nick Laird\u2019s       novel \u201cModern Gods\u201d (Viking, 308 pages, $27), which takes on the atrocities committed in the name of religion and politics. The book\u2019s parallel stories concern the sisters Alison and Liz Donnelly. Alison is a mother of two living in Ireland who is moving on from her abusive first marriage by wedding a quiet but kindly man named Stephen. Once they\u2019re married, however, Stephen\u2019s secret past emerges. Some 20 years before, during the Troubles, he was part of a Protestant paramilitary group that carried out a killing spree in a pub in a Catholic neighborhood of Northern Ireland.Meanwhile, Liz, a New York-based academic, has been chosen to host a BBC documentary about \u201cthe world\u2019s newest religion,\u201d a cargo cult on an island off Papua New Guinea led by a prophetess named Belef. Predictably, Belef\u2019s beliefs clash with those of the Christian missionaries on the island, and Liz becomes entangled in their feud as it tilts toward tragedy.Mr. Laird is alive to the ways that adamant moral certitudes tend toward violence. \u201cRighteous fury is so easy, can be slipped on like a coat,\u201d he writes. Yet the novel\u2019s real source of discomfort is not its ideas but its prose. \u201cModern Gods\u201d opens with a dramatization of the mass shooting in the pub, a fictionalization of the Greysteel massacre of 1993. The descriptions are disturbingly stylized, noting the \u201carchipelagic blood\u201d spattered on a bar mirror and still more blood flowing in \u201cdark runnels across the parquet dance floor.\u201d In a flashback later on, a bullet moves \u201cwith exquisite speed\u201d through a woman\u2019s skull. The images sickeningly evoke recent horrors like the Sandy Hook shooting and the Bataclan terror attack.

Now they have to decide whether to remain with a seemingly rudderless company in urgent need of leadership, or to break loose and, for some, risk losing stock options potentially worth millions of dollars.Months of unflattering headlines and an ongoing investigation into allegations of sexual harassment and sexism at Uber have taken a toll. In interviews, some employees expressed sadness over the company\u2019s now-tainted reputation, while others said they were upset with management for allowing its dirty laundry to be aired. Some said they were hopeful Uber could restore its reputation after adopting nearly 50 changes to improve workplace culture that resulted from an internal investigation into workplace conduct by former U.S. Attorney General       Eric Holder\u2019s       law firm.Some employees are standing by Mr. Kalanick. More than 1,000 signed an internal petition demanding that the board reinstall him. \u201cEmployees, we need to revolt this!\u201d read the petition, reviewed by the Journal.\u201cWe\u2019re focused on rebuilding trust with our employees and the communities we serve, and building a company and culture that we can be proud of,\u201d an Uber spokesman said.Mr. Kalanick stepped down as CEO Tuesday after two venture capitalists at Benchmark confronted him with a signed letter from the firm and four other shareholders demanding his ouster, according to people familiar with the matter. After several hours of deliberation, Mr. Kalanick relinquished his post.His exit followed the removal or resignation in recent months of more than a half-dozen direct reports and a number of other managers, including the heads of finance, operations, business, marketing and communications.

Underscoring the urgency, the board has discussed a time frame of about six weeks for finding a new CEO, according to people familiar with the matter.Some employees said the uncertainty has made it hard to work, especially as they have watched co-workers pack up their desks. Others said they are considering leaving, fearful that Uber could face a struggle to raise new funds. On the other hand, some worry about missing on out a big payday if they leave before their stock options fully vest, which takes four years, or before a reinvention of the company culture.\u201cPeople are leaving because they feel like it\u2019s on fire,\u201d said Nora Hamada, a recruiter with Mirus Search, who said she has helped a handful of Uber employees find work at other startups.Uber employees once were considered almost unpoachable, because of hefty equity stakes and Uber\u2019s rocketing growth, tech recruiters say. Now, some employers are wary of hiring Uber employees out of concern they could bring the culture with them, recruiters note. One executive at a startup that has hired from Uber said the firm has deliberately recruited junior employees and not managers.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of peer pressure to quit Uber to work at a more ethical company,\u201d Ms. Hamada said. Female employees she has spoken with in particular feel pressured by friends and peers at other tech firms to leave, she said.\u201cI\u2019ve heard many of you mention that you\u2019re grappling with mixed emotions this week,\u201d Ann Bordetsky, an Uber business-development executive, wrote in an email Thursday to \u201cthe women of Uber.\u201d \u201cWhatever you\u2019re feeling\u2014surprised, nostalgic, optimistic, sad or unphased [sic] (maybe all that and more)\u2014we\u2019re here with you.\u201dIn coming weeks, managers are expected to deliver employee performance reviews, using an overhauled feedback and goal-setting framework shaped by two recent hires: Liane Hornsey, chief of human resources, and       Frances Frei,        senior vice president of leadership and strategy.Rather than numerically ranking employees against one another based on performance and potential career trajectory, and linking the ranking directly with pay, Uber is encouraging managers to help their teams set three or four business goals and broader \u201ccitizenship\u201d goals for the company, employees said. Other changes include training in diversity and adopting a version of the \u201cRooney Rule,\u201d which requires hiring managers to interview diverse candidates for all open positions, according to an email from Ms. Hornsey reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. Managers will have separate training sessions, as nearly two-thirds are in management for the first time.Teams at Uber have now been assigned an \u201cowner\u201d of human resources policies, to whom employees can quickly escalate concerns. \u201cWe will not fail you again,\u201d Ms. Hornsey said in the email.Ms. Frei, a Harvard Business School professor Uber hired earlier this month to tackle the company\u2019s workplace issues, has quickly emerged as a leader in remaking the company\u2019s culture.A familiar face around headquarters in the months leading up to her appointment, Ms. Frei this week was traveling to Uber offices in Europe to coach managers and employees on setting \u201cholistic\u201d goals for individuals and teams. The company is encouraging every Uber employee to participate in a training session she is facilitating this summer, according to employees. Ms. Frei referred a request for comment to a company spokeswoman.Employees don\u2019t expect Ms. Frei to single-handedly repair the company\u2019s internal dynamics. But some say she has boosted morale and sparked optimism about change.\u201cThe question of the moment right now is how to demonstrate to employees and to drivers that the company is truly changing its culture,\u201d said       Michael Useem,        a management professor at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School of Business.\u2014       Maureen Farrell       contributed to this article.Write to Greg Bensinger at greg.bensinger@wsj.com and Kelsey Gee at kelsey.gee@wsj.comAppeared in the June 24, 2017, print edition as 'Uber Woos Workers to Stay.'", "news_time": "2017-06-23 16:12:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/uber-makes-quick-workplace-reforms-to-calm-strained-nerves-1498237561", "news_title": "Leaderless Uber Scrambles to Prevent Employee Exodus", "keywords": "ceo,corporate culture,diversity,human resources,policies,sexism,uber,vc industry news,workforce,workplace,Uber Technologies,management,management moves,labor,personnel,corporate,industrial news,senior level management,retail,wholesale,etailing,e-commerce,internet,online,technology,sharing economy services"}, {"content": "Takata Corp.        7312 48.15%      , the supplier of rupture-prone air bags linked to numerous deaths and injuries, is preparing to seek bankruptcy protection as soon as Sunday with a tentative deal to sell operations to a rival, people familiar with the matter said.The Japanese automotive supplier, in a long-expected move to address mounting liabilities from an unprecedented safety recall, is putting the finishing touches on a bankruptcy petition expected to be filed in a Delaware federal court and another filing in Japan, the people said.Under the current plan, Takata\u2019s Michigan-based subsidiary plans to seek chapter 11 protection from creditors in the U.S. Sunday evening while the parent company pursues a bankruptcy filing in Japan on Monday, the people said.The twin bankruptcy filings are expected to occur around the same time, though technically on separate days given the differing time zones involved, the people said. Takata\u2019s board is expected to convene this weekend to review and approve the plan, the people said.Takata has an agreement in principle to sell the bulk of its assets for roughly $1.6 billion to Key Safety Systems Inc., a rival Michigan supplier owned by a Chinese company, Ningbo Joyson Electronic Corp., the people said.The deal, expected to be consummated through U.S. bankruptcy proceedings, would essentially carve Takata in two. Key Safety would assume Takata\u2019s main operations, while leaving behind liabilities tied to the Japanese company\u2019s air bags.Proceeds from the sale would help pay $850 million to a compensation fund for auto makers shouldering recall costs, a requirement of Takata\u2019s agreement earlier this year to plead guilty to criminal wrongdoing in the U.S. for providing misleading testing reports on the air bags, the people said.Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp. is expected to provide Takata with a loan as part of the bankruptcy proceedings, one of the people said.Takata\u2019s restructuring plans have been delayed before, and the timing of the expected bankruptcy filings could slip. But Takata\u2019s advisers are racing to complete the bankruptcy filings this weekend, the people familiar with the matter said.Takata\u2019s long-simmering bankruptcy preparations follow an unprecedented safety crisis stemming from tens of millions of air bags that risk exploding and spraying shrapnel in vehicle cabins, a defect linked to at least 16 deaths and more than 180 injuries globally.The company earlier this year pleaded guilty to criminal wire fraud and agreed to pay $1 billion in penalties for providing misleading testing reports to auto makers on the air bags, settling a longstanding U.S. Justice Department probe. In addition to restitution for auto makers, the plea deal required Takata to pay $125 million to a compensation fund for consumers.In the U.S. alone, 19 auto makers are in the process of eventually recalling 42 million vehicles with up to nearly 70 million Takata air bags, the largest automotive safety campaign in American history.The exploding air bags sparked U.S. congressional hearings, widespread litigation and hammered Takata\u2019s finances, forcing it to weigh a bankruptcy filing and seek a financial backer. In May, Takata reported a roughly $718 million loss for the full year ending in March.

The 10-year yield hovered just above its closing low of the year for four consecutive sessions.Yields are being held down to a large degree by a run of soft inflation data, which has boosted the appeal of government debt and raised doubts about the Federal Reserve\u2019s plans to raise interest rates at least one more time this year. Their decline has been kept in check, at the same time, by key Fed officials insisting inflation is still on track to reach their 2% target.Inflation is a main threat to government bonds because it chips away the purchasing power of their fixed returns and can lead to tighter monetary policy.The next major reading on inflation won\u2019t come until the end of next week, when the Commerce Department releases its latest report on the personal-consumption expenditures price index, the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation gauge.

Corporate Gmail already doesn\u2019t mine emails for information, but Google\u2019s business model of collecting user data generally has added to concerns about privacy that complicate its effort to sell more technology to corporations.Google says that unlike with its free, advertising-supported services for consumers, it doesn\u2019t mine corporate clients\u2019 data for advertising. \u201cGoogle\u2019s (corporate) customers own their data, not Google,\u201d the company said in an online post.

Still, losing data from email correspondence is likely to weaken Google\u2019s profiles of users, which enable the company to charge advertisers more to target specific groups of consumers.

Mr. Tensing was fired from his job shortly after he was indicted over the shooting in 2015.\u00a0A mistrial was declared last November after a jury similarly failed to come to a unanimous decision.The jury in this most recent trial was made up of nine women and three men. The prosecutors in Hamilton County must now decide whether to seek a third trial.Mr. Tensing pulled over Mr. DuBose about a mile from the University of Cincinnati in July 2015. The former officer,\u00a0who reached inside the vehicle,\u00a0said he was being dragged by Mr. DuBose\u2019s car as he tried to leave the scene and was forced to shoot. But prosecutors argued that his statements were contradicted by video evidence, captured on his body camera.In Mr. Tensing\u2019s testimony during the retrial, he argued that Mr. DuBose\u2019s car was moving into him and that he was afraid he would be run over. The defense sought to prove that his use of force was justified because the officer feared for his life and reasonably tried to stop the threat.Prosecutors argued that video footage of the incident showed\u00a0Mr. Tensing fired at the motorist\u00a0about one second after Mr. DuBose\u2019s car started moving and therefore the officer couldn't have reasonably feared for his life.Prosecutors and Mr. Tensing\u2019s attorney weren\u2019t available to comment after the mistrial was declared\u00a0Friday\u00a0afternoon.Mr. DuBose\u2019s family has declined to comment to television reporters after the verdict\u00a0on Friday\u00a0and asked for privacy.

Whether shy or outgoing, a leader or a follower, we are\u2014notwithstanding minor tweaks\u2014who we are.But what if a whole generation can learn a new set of tricks?A new study suggests as much. Published this month in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the research shows a shift in many personality traits in men that could make them more successful in the workplace. This huge study included 80% of the male population born in Finland between 1962 and 1976, or 419,523 young men. All of them had taken standardized cognitive and personality tests when they entered the Finnish Defense Forces under a compulsory male draft at the age 19 or 20.The researchers then looked at these Finnish men\u2019s average annual earnings at age 30 to 34, which the scientists considered a good predictor of their lifetime earnings.What struck researchers the most was that self-confidence, sociability and leadership motivation all rose on average from the group of men born in 1962 to those born in 1976. Striving, deliberation and dutifulness crept up too, though not as much. Levels of intelligence or family income didn\u2019t seem to be driving these generational shifts, given that they surfaced at all cognitive levels and social strata.And here\u2019s the kicker: When the researchers compared personality scores when the men entered the draft with earnings at age 30 to 34, they found that even small upward shifts in personality ratings predicted a higher income 10 years later\u2014with the 1976 group earning as much as 12% more than its 1962 counterpart, when other factors such as inflation, overall wage rises and education were stripped away.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to say that personality improves, because reasonable people can perfectly well disagree on what constitutes a good personality,\u201d wrote       Matti Sarvim\u00e4ki,        one of five authors of the study and an economist at Aalto University in Finland. \u201cWhat we show is that the types of personality traits that predict higher earnings rise\u201d from birth year to birth year.Of course, we should be cautious when extrapolating from the experience of Finland, a country of about 5.5 million people, to the U.S. Nor is it clear whether these results would have a positive effect on the American labor pool. In addition, the Finnish study, due to the male-only draft, was limited to men.Still, this study\u2019s findings line up with some other positive trends. U.S. college students have become more outgoing, self-confident and self-absorbed\u2014though that last trait may not be quite as positive as the others. Another rising measure: IQ scores are improving about three points a decade, a phenomenon known as the Flynn effect.As with IQs, we don\u2019t know why personality traits are changing. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a mystery,\u201d says       Richard Haier,        an emeritus professor at the University of California, Irvine, and the author of \u201cThe Neuroscience of Intelligence.\u201dIf extraversion is rising, he said, then\u2014as is the case with IQ-test levels\u2014improvements in general health and nutrition could be affecting the change. Education too could play a role, he says\u2014for example, more exposure to problem-solving at school. Indeed, education is one of the factors Prof. Sarvim\u00e4ki will explore next.Appeared in the June 24, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-06-23 15:26:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/can-an-entire-generation-change-its-personality-1498245984", "news_title": "Can an Entire Generation Change Its Personality?", "keywords": "business,earnings,finland,population,research,science,studies,susan pinker,wages,political,general news,psychology,sciences,humanities"}, {"content": "SEOUL\u2014North Korea lashed out at the U.S. over criticisms of its treatment of       Otto Warmbier,        the 22-year-old American student who died earlier this week after his return home in a coma, in a sharply worded statement that is likely to further inflame tensions between Washington and Pyongyang.The remarks from North Korea\u2019s Foreign Ministry, the first since Mr. Warmbier\u2019s death, described Pyongyang as \u201cthe biggest victim\u201d of the incident and called the University of Virginia undergraduate \u201ca criminal who committed hostile acts\u201d against North Korea.The statement called the U.S. condemnations of Mr. Warmbier\u2019s treatment a \u201csmear campaign abusing the humanitarian measure\u201d that Pyongyang made in releasing Mr. Warmbier, who North Korea described as an agent of the Central Intelligence Agency on assignment in Pyongyang.\u201cAlthough we had no reason at all to show mercy to such a criminal of the enemy state, we provided him with medical treatments and care with all sincerity on humanitarian basis until his return to the U.S., considering that his health got worse,\u201d the unnamed spokesman said, according to a report carried by the state-controlled Korean Central News Agency.\u201cThe U.S. is making every frantic effort to disparage the prestige of the dignified DPRK and stifle it while imposing heinous sanctions and pressure unprecedented in history,\u201d the spokesman added, using the acronym for North Korea\u2019s formal name, the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea.Mr. Warmbier, who was arrested by North Korean authorities in January last year after allegedly ripping down a propaganda poster from the wall of his Pyongyang hotel during a group tour of the isolated country, had been in a coma for more than a year when he was released by North Korea \u201con humanitarian grounds\u201d earlier this month. He died six days later.Mr. Warmbier\u2019s death has sparked a wave of anger in Washington toward Pyongyang and its treatment of detained U.S. citizens. Several congressmen have described Mr. Warmbier\u2019s death as murder, while administration officials such as       Nikki Haley,        the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, have called Mr. Warmbier\u2019s death a reflection of \u201cthe barbaric nature of the North Korean dictatorship.\u201dMr. Warmbier returned home with a severe brain injury, the cause of which remains unclear. He slipped into a coma more than a year ago, U.S. officials and members of his family said.\u200b\u200bNorth Korea told U.S. officials during a secret meeting last week that Mr. Warmbier first lost consciousness after contracting botulism and taking a sleeping pill. North Korea didn\u2019t address the assertion that it kept Mr. Warmbier\u2019s coma secret for a year.The Hamilton County Coroner\u2019s Office in Ohio is investigating Mr. Warmbier\u2019s death, but the family of Mr. Warmbier has objected to an autopsy.North Korea\u2019s Foreign Ministry said in its statement that it had returned Mr. Warmbier to the U.S. government in good condition, and that it had no knowledge of why he died so soon after his release.\u201cHis health indicators like pulse, temperature, respiration and the examination result of the heart and lung were all normal,\u201d the spokesman said. \u201cThe fact that Warmbier died suddenly in less than a week just after his return to the U.S. in his normal state of health indicators is a mystery to us as well.\u201dIn a separate statement published minutes earlier, the North denied that it had engaged in any torture or brutal treatment of Mr. Warmbier, calling the claims \u201crubbish.\u201dSen.       John McCain,        among others, has suggested that Mr. Warmbier likely underwent torture during his detention.Mr. Warmbier\u2019s death has threatened to further ratchet up tensions between Washington and Pyongyang. In Washington, a bilateral bill to block U.S. citizens from traveling to North Korea as tourists was moving forward in the House of Representatives.Rep.       Ed Royce       (R., Calif.), chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, had committed to review the bill, according to a statement Thursday from the bill\u2019s co-sponsors.Young Pioneer Tours, the China-based tour agency that brought Mr. Warmbier to Pyongyang, said earlier this week that it would no longer organize tours to North Korea for U.S. citizens.South Korea\u2019s new president, Moon Jae-in, who is due to arrive in Washington next week for a two-day summit with President       Donald Trump,        expressed his condolences to the Warmbier family, and on Friday, Seoul\u2019s newly appointed foreign minister expressed sympathy to Washington\u2019s top envoy in Seoul.North Korea, in one of its statements Friday, hit out at Mr. Moon for expressing condolences to the U.S., in a rare criticism of the new South Korean leader, who campaigned on a platform of closer ties with Pyongyang.North Korean officials hinted at the state\u2019s hard-line position on Mr. Warmbier\u2019s fate last week, saying at a public forum in Mongolia that Mr. Warmbier\u2019s punishment\u2014a 15-year sentence of hard labor\u2014was justified because he had sought to overthrow North Korea\u2019s government.Write to Jonathan Cheng at jonathan.cheng@wsj.comAppeared in the June 24, 2017, print edition as 'Pyongyang Calls Itself \u2018Victim\u2019 in Warmbier Furor.'", "news_time": "2017-06-23 14:50:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/north-korea-calls-u-s-furor-over-warmbier-a-smear-campaign-1498215180", "news_title": "North Korea Calls U.S. Furor Over Warmbier a \u2018Smear Campaign\u2019 ", "keywords": " autopsy, botulism ,brain injury, coma, dprk,family,north korea,otto warmbier. north korea, pyongyang,south korea president,torture,trump, u.s. student,warmbier death,Otto Warmbier,political,general news,national,public security,international relations,international sanctions,politics,risk news,military action"}, {"content": "BRUSSELS\u2014French President       Emmanuel Macron\u2019s       bid to revitalize the European Union is bumping into longstanding divisions over trade, with countries that depend on Chinese cash resisting his push to scrutinize foreign investments.Following Mr. Macron electoral victories on a pro-European platform, he received a warm welcome at his first EU summit in Brussels.

This is not how it works here.\u201dThe sparring illustrates the hurdles that Mr. Macron faces in uniting a bloc that has grappled for decades with bridging competing priorities. To overcome the challenge, the French leader\u2019s top goal is to forge common policies with German Chancellor       Angela Merkel       to revamp the Franco-German engine that has traditionally driven European reforms.At stake is the EU\u2019s ability to champion free trade in response to U.S. President       Donald Trump\u2019s       protectionist policies, without exposing European workers to what populists call \u201csavage globalism.\u201d That push comes as the bloc also struggles to pry open China\u2019s market for European businesses, just as Chinese investments in EU companies hit a record $48 billion last year, according to data provider Dealogic.France and Germany have long sought to block Chinese access to strategic industries, but some EU members have stymied that effort to safeguard billions of dollars from China.\u201cAttachment to free trade and multilateralism does not mean naivet\u00e9,\u201d Mr. Macron said. \u201cFair competition is preferable to the law of the jungle.\u201dAsked about Mr. Macron\u2019s tough line, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman noted the \u201csurge in protectionism\u201d that the EU and many countries are facing, but said EU leaders recently pledged to cooperate with China. \u201cWe hope the EU can offer a sound and unbiased environment for Chinese companies,\u201d the spokesman, Geng Shuang, said at a daily briefing Friday in Beijing.Starting with a suggestion that the EU respond to Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cBuy American\u201d policy in kind, Mr. Macron has emerged as the outspoken champion of shielding European industries from unfair competition.That cause is also finding traction in Germany, where Chinese acquisitions have hit a record and fueled concern in Berlin that the country is losing control over its most competitive and advanced companies. At the same time, European investments in China have declined for four years due to obstruction from Beijing, according to a joint report by Mercator Institute for China Studies and Rhodium Group.\u201cIn times where protectionism is at the top of the agenda for some countries, a clear commitment to free but rules-based trade is very important,\u201d Ms. Merkel said during a joint press briefing with the French president.Mr. Macron\u2019s election has contributed to the momentum slowly building behind a Paris-Berlin proposal, also supported by Rome, for the EU to scrutinize foreign investments. Its evolution could serve as a bellwether for Ms. Merkel and Mr. Macron\u2019s ability to shape policy in Brussels.The effort got a boost\u00a0Friday, when EU leaders said they welcomed an initiative by the bloc\u2019s executive\u2014the European Commission\u2014to \u201canalyze investments from third countries in strategic sectors.\u201dResistance from many EU members forced France and Germany to significantly water down the commission\u2019s directive, which initially sought to lay the groundwork for a bill.\u201cSome feel this should be done in a European scale and others feel this is a national competence,\u201d an EU diplomat said. \u201cWe\u2019re not ready to jump to a conclusion that we need new legislation.\u201dBut Friday\u2019s\u00a0summit put the issue of screening foreign investments firmly on the EU agenda.A similar effort fizzled out in 2011, and the success of the current initiative is far from certain. While conditions are improving, economic disparities within the bloc and different global trade links create difficulties for developing a common agenda on foreign investments.\u201cThere\u2019s a push by Macron, there\u2019s resistance by some members,\u201d an EU official said. \u201cPortugal, Greece, others -- they need investment for growth, they\u2019re eager to get Chinese money to get themselves out of the water.\u201dThere are other hurdles for Mr. Macron as he proposes deeper integration to overcome the EU\u2019s crisis-marred, decadelong slumber. The French president has criticized European countries for not taking refugees and accused them of \u201csocial dumping,\u201d or sending cheap labor, to Western Europe while luring away its manufacturers with lower wages.\u201cWe differ in our opinions about many matters,\u201d Ms. Szydlo, Poland\u2019s prime minister, said. \u201cBut being open to dialogue and trying to find consensus is a good prospect.\u201d\u2014Valentina Pop and Julian E.

Both are founding members of the SkyTeam marketing alliance and received U.S. Transportation Department antitrust authority to more closely cooperate in 2002. They didn\u2019t act on that regulatory green light until now.In anticipation of the expanded partnership, Delta recently launched nonstop service to Seoul from its big Atlanta hub, complementing Korean Air\u2019s existing flight. \u201cNow is the right time for this JV,\u201d said Korean Air Chairman Y.H.

They also would share costs and revenue on flights operated within the joint venture, which is subject to regulatory approval. No equity will change hands.Delta has faced challenges for years with its operations in Asia. Its hub at Tokyo\u2019s Narita Airport has lost business to Haneda Airport, better situated in the megalopolis.

American Chief Executive       Doug Parker       called the bid \u201cpuzzling and strange\u201d and American\u2019s pilots and flight attendants unions oppose the bid. The opposition has thrust Mr. Al Baker into an unfamiliar role: corporate raider.Qatar Airways has usually delighted other airlines around the globe when it has taken stakes in them. When Mr. Al Baker began investing in British Airways\u2019 owner International Consolidated Airlines Group SA\u2014which has now grown into a 20% stake\u2014the move was embraced by the airline. The British government didn\u2019t stand in the way.Mr. Al Baker holds a reputation for confrontation within the airline industry. He regularly calls out airplane makers for missed deadlines and what he considers quality shortcomings.Eight years ago at the Paris Air Show, he blasted             Boeing Co.       executives over problems the plane maker encountered on its new 787 Dreamliner plane. The company, he said, \u201cis being run by bean counters and lawyers.\u201dTwo years later, after an         Airbus               SE delay shipping jets, Mr. Al Baker told reporters that \u201cAirbus is still learning how to make airplanes.\u201dThe sometimes combative Qatar Airways CEO says he doesn\u2019t want a fight in his latest move. But he isn\u2019t backing down. Qatar is seeking U.S. antitrust approval to buy just under 4.75% of American on the open market. The Mideast carrier said it would only increase that if it won American board approval but would keep just a passive stake.Other tensions color the attempted transaction.American accuses Qatar Airways and other Persian Gulf carriers of benefiting unfairly from state backing and is pursuing a subsidy claim. Qatar denies the allegation. Qatar\u2019s Gulf neighbors, meanwhile, recently cut diplomatic and transport links with the country, accusing it of supporting Islamist groups and extremists in the region. Qatar denies those accusations.Earlier this month, Mr. Al Baker took a swipe at President Donald Trump, criticizing him for backing Saudi Arabia in its current political standoff with Qatar. \u201cI thought he was more shrewd,\u201d he told The Wall Street Journal.Mr. Al Baker serves his bosses in Qatar\u2014the ruling Al-Thani family\u2014in ways beyond his capacity as Qatar Airways\u2019 boss. He sits on the board of         Volkswagen AG      , for instance, representing the Qatari government\u2019s roughly 17% stake in the auto maker.Aside from his sometimes abrasive image, Mr. Al Baker is regarded as a pragmatic executive.\u201cBusiness is what drives him,\u201d said analyst John Strickland, who has followed Mr. Al Baker\u2019s career for more than a decade.In response to airspace restrictions imposed by Qatar\u2019s Gulf neighbors, for instance, Mr. Al Baker quickly moved to readjust plans for the airline and pressured international regulators to intervene. He \u201cwon\u2019t take things lying down,\u201d said Mr. Strickland.Qatar Airways declined to make Mr. Al Baker available. A Qatar government spokesperson didn\u2019t have aimmediate comment.Born in 1960, in Doha, Mr. Al Baker studied economics and commerce and joined the country\u2019s civil aviation administration, where he eventually worked in a number of senior posts. In 1997, he was tapped to run fledgling Qatar Airways, at the time a regional carrier.It now flies to more than 150 far-flung cities, including Houston and Auckland, New Zealand. It has raised its international profile through high-profile sponsorships of the FC Barcelona soccer club and FIFA soccer\u2019s World Cup. Its lavish first- and business-class service has helped win it a prestigious 5 stars in the Skytrax international airline ranking system.It is difficult to say how costly that has all been. The airline only began publishing audited financial results last year. Earlier this month, it said profit rose 22% to about $540 million for the fiscal year ending March 31. Sales grew about 10% on the year.U.S. carriers critical of Qatar have said its public financials mask big handouts that helped fuel growth. In a dossier provided to the U.S. government in 2015, the American rivals argue Qatar Airways has received $8.4 billion in government loans and advances that don\u2019t have to be repaid, and another $6.8 billion in loan guarantees. Free land and discounted airport charges represent more than $1 billion in additional state aid, they allege.Qatar Airways said their rivals\u2019 subsidy definition is inaccurate and, that by that same standard, U.S. airlines received massive state aid through their ability to restructure under chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.Write to Robert Wall at robert.wall@wsj.comAppeared in the June 24, 2017, print edition as 'Move on Rival Puts Airline Boss On \u2018Strange\u2019 Path.'", "news_time": "2017-06-23 14:26:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/american-airlines-bid-puts-qatar-airways-chief-in-new-role-raider-1498242390", "news_title": "American Airlines Bid Puts Qatar Airways\u2019 Chief in New Role: Raider", "keywords": " acquisitions,airlines, mergers, middle east, qatar bid for american,American Airlines Group,AAL,International Consolidated Airlines Group,IAG.LN,Qatar Airways,British Airways,Volkswagen Non-Vtg Pfd.,XE:VOW3,Boeing,BA,Airbus SE,FR:AIR,Akbar Al Baker,corporate,industrial news,scheduled passenger airlines,air transport,automotive,industrial goods,packaging,transportation,logistics"}, {"content": "In less than two decades, more than half of all publicly traded companies have disappeared. There were 7,355 U.S. stocks in November 1997, according to the Center for Research in Security Prices at the University of Chicago\u2019s Booth School of Business. Nowadays, there are fewer than 3,600.A close look at the data helps explain why stock pickers have been underperforming. And the shrinking number of companies should make all investors more skeptical about the market-beating claims of recently trendy strategies.Back in November 1997, there were more than 2,500 small stocks and nearly 4,000 \u201cmicrocap\u201d stocks, according to the Center for Research in Security Prices. At the end of 2016, fewer than 1,200 small and just under 1,900 microcap stocks were left.Most of those companies melted away between 2000 and 2012, but the numbers show no signs of recovering.Several factors explain the shrinking number of stocks, analysts say, including the regulatory red tape that discourages smaller companies from going and staying public; the flood of venture-capital funding that enables young companies to stay private longer; and the rise of private-equity funds, whose buyouts take shares off the public market.For stock pickers, differentiating among the remaining choices is \u201can even harder game\u201d than it was when the market consisted of twice as many companies, says       Michael Mauboussin,        an investment strategist at             Credit Suisse                   Group AG in New York who wrote a report this spring titled \u201cThe Incredible Shrinking Universe of Stocks.\u201dThat\u2019s because the surviving companies tend to be \u201cfewer, bigger, older, more profitable and easier to analyze,\u201d he says, making stock picking much more competitive.Consider small-stock funds. Often, they compare themselves with the Russell 2000, an index of the U.S. stocks ranked 1,001 through 3,000 by total market value. \u201cTwenty years ago, there were over 4,000 stocks smaller\u201d than the inclusion cutoff for the Russell 2000, says       Lubos Pastor,        a finance professor at the University of Chicago. \u201cThat number is down to less than 1,000 today.\u201dSo fund managers have far fewer stocks to choose from if they venture outside the index, the very area in which the best bargains might be found. More money chasing fewer stocks could lead some fund managers to buy indiscriminately, regardless of value.Eric Cinnamond       is a veteran portfolio manager with a solid record of investing in small stocks. Last year, he took the drastic step of shutting down his roughly $400 million mutual fund, Aston/River Road Independent Value, and giving his investors their money back.\u201cPrices got so crazy in small-caps, I fired myself,\u201d he says. \u201cMy portfolio was 90% in cash at the end, because I couldn\u2019t find anything to buy. If I\u2019d kept investing, I was sure I\u2019d lose people their money.\u201dHe adds, \u201cIt was the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done professionally, but I didn\u2019t feel I had a choice. I knew my companies were overvalued.\u201dMr. Cinnamond hopes to return to the market when, in his view, values become attractive again. He doesn\u2019t expect recent conditions to be permanent.The evaporation of thousands of companies may have one enduring result, however, and it could catch many investors by surprise.Most research on historical returns, points out Mr. Mauboussin, is based on the days when the stock market had twice as many companies as it does today. \u201cWas the population of companies so different then,\u201d he asks, \u201cthat the inferences we draw from it might no longer be valid?\u201d\u201cFactor investing,\u201d also known as systematic or smart-beta investing, picks hundreds or thousands of stocks at a time based on common sources of risk and return. Among them: how big companies are, how much their shares fluctuate, how expensive their shares are relative to asset value and so on.But the historical outperformance of many such factors may have been driven largely by the tiniest companies, exactly those that have disappeared from the market in droves.Before concluding that small stocks or cheap \u201cvalue\u201d stocks will outrace the market as impressively as they did in the past, you should pause to consider how they will perform without the tailwinds from thousands of tiny stocks that no longer exist.The stock market has more than tripled in the past eight years, so the eclipse of so many companies hasn\u2019t been a catastrophe. But it does imply that investing in some of the market\u2019s trendiest strategies might be less profitable in the future than they looked in the past.Write to Jason Zweig at intelligentinvestor@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-23 13:55:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/stock-picking-is-dying-because-there-are-no-more-stocks-to-pick-1498240513", "news_title": "Stock Picking Is Dying Because There Are No More Stocks to Pick ", "keywords": "intelligent investor, jason zweig, stock market, stock picking,Credit Suisse Group,CSGN.EB,CS,Eric Cinnamond,Lubos Pastor,Michael Mauboussin,equity markets,commodity,financial market news"}, {"content": "BlackBerry Ltd.        BBRY 2.63%       stock plunged 11% in Friday trading after the company posted a steep drop in quarterly revenue as it continues to shift focus to its burgeoning software business.Waterloo, Ontario-based BlackBerry has turned to its software and services division for revenue growth after years of lagging behind rivals such as Apple Inc.\u2019s iPhone and devices powered by Android, a unit of             Alphabet Inc.\u2019s       Google, in the consumer smartphone market.The Canadian software and device company on Friday reported a net profit of $671 million, or $1.23 a share, in its fiscal quarter ended May 31. On an adjusted basis, excluding certain items, the company reported earnings of 2 cents a share. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected the company to break even in the quarter. A year earlier, the company lost $670 million, or $1.28 a share.Overall first-quarter revenue fell 41%, to $235 million, from $400 million a year earlier. Revenue in the fiscal fourth quarter totaled $286 million. BlackBerry said it generated $160 million in software and services revenue, compared with $142 million a\u00a0year earlier.Chief Executive       John Chen,        during a round-table discussion with reporters, attributed the revenue decline to a professional services contract that wasn\u2019t renewed as well as a deferral of revenue from its acquisition of Good Technologies a year ago.About 79% of its software revenue came from recurring customers in the quarter. \u201cWe believe that this is important as it creates a stable base to grow from,\u201d said TD Securities analyst       Daniel Chen.       The analyst added that the next two quarters may be \u201cweak\u201d despite BlackBerry maintaining guidance of 10%-15% growth in its software segment.Mr. Chen, the chief executive, said BlackBerry could realistically see annual revenue grow north of $1 billion within three years as it focuses on its software business as well as through any potential acquisitions to help boost its bottom line. That revenue target would see a larger number of institutional investors take a closer look at BlackBerry and provide the company with additional long-term stability, he said.\u201cI\u2019m hoping that [getting to] $1 billion won\u2019t be a very long time for it to happen,\u201d Mr. Chen said.The company announced Friday it plans to liquidate its remaining BlackBerry device inventory in the next quarter as it completely shifts production of its handsets to third-party manufacturers in Asia. It also announced a deal with             FedEx Corp.       to deploy some of its BlackBerry Radar logistical tracking devices in some of the company\u2019s delivery vehicles. BlackBerry\u2019s Mr. Chen said the company plans to offer a scaled down of its Radar technology later this year that should address a much larger market of container shipments. BlackBerry also is looking to invest in adding more sales staff through hires or acquisition to sell its Radar devices to the market, Mr. Chen added. \u201cWe\u2019re OK in the car area, but for Radar, we need more distribution,\u201d he said.BlackBerry said it plans to repurchase 31 million common shares, representing 6.4% of its outstanding public float. The share-repurchase program comes after BlackBerry was awarded $815 million from             Qualcomm Inc.       in April for royalty overpayments. Mr. Chen noted Friday that the Qualcomm payments haven\u2019t affected the relationship between the two companies, with the chip maker recently signing onto its Hypervisor car technology.Excluding $605 million in debt, BlackBerry\u2019s cash balance at the end of the quarter stood at approximately $1.9 billion.

A country that was once one of Latin America\u2019s wealthiest is seeing its democratic institutions collapse, leading to levels of disease, hunger and dysfunction more often seen in war-torn nations than oil-rich ones.Mr. Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s successor, President       Nicol\u00e1s Maduro,        has called for a National Constitutional Assembly to be elected on July 30 to draft a new constitution, in which ill-defined communal councils will take the place of Venezuela\u2019s traditional governing institutions, such as state governments and the opposition-dominated Congress. The new assembly appears to be rigged to heavily represent groups that back the government.The Maduro government says that the new assembly will find a peaceful way forward for a country enduring an economic depression and standing on the brink of civil conflict. The government says it is building on the legacy of Mr. Ch\u00e1vez, a military man who vowed to fight corruption, dismantle the venal old political establishment and be a voice for millions of poor Venezuelans. But the opposition, which is boycotting the assembly vote, calls it a naked attempt to end democracy and turn the country into a Cuba-style communist autocracy. The government\u2019s own attorney general calls the vote illegal.The 545-member assembly, a modern-day soviet, would hold unlimited power while it writes a new governing charter, which could take years. Meantime, the assembly is widely expected to scrap next year\u2019s presidential elections.\u201cThis is the last battle for democracy in Venezuela,\u201d says       David Smilde,        a Venezuela expert at Tulane University.For the U.S., the prospect of a new Cuba sitting atop trillions of dollars of oil reserves is profoundly unpleasant. For the past decade, Venezuela has aligned itself with Russia, China, Iran and Syria. Whether it thrives or implodes, Mr. Maduro\u2019s petrostate could cause far greater headaches to the U.S. and Latin America than isolated Cuba. An implosion could mean bigger shipments of cocaine to Central America and the U.S., as well as a massive increase in the current flow of tens of thousands of refugees already fleeing the country for the U.S., Colombia, Brazil and elsewhere. And a consolidation of power could let Mr. Maduro deepen his partnership with U.S. adversaries.The Trump administration has criticized Mr. Maduro\u2019s plans to change the constitution, urging \u201crespect for democratic norms and processes.\u201d The U.S. has called for Venezuela to free political prisoners, respect the opposition-controlled congress and \u201chold free and democratic elections.\u201dMr. Maduro\u2019s move has aggravated Venezuela\u2019s political crisis. The opposition, sensing a do-or-die moment, plans to ramp up daily street protests. Some 80 people have died in such demonstrations in the past three months, and the president is unlikely to ease off on the tear gas, rubber bullets and water cannons.\u2018Maduro\u2019s ultimate aim is to turn Venezuela into Cuba.\u2019\u201cMaduro\u2019s ultimate aim is to turn Venezuela into Cuba. And we will not accept being put in that cage,\u201d says       Julio Borges,        the head of the opposition-dominated National Assembly.Venezuela\u2019s momentous new step isn\u2019t taking place amid the kind of revolutionary euphoria that Mr. Ch\u00e1vez may have imagined before he died of cancer in 2013. Rather, it is being pushed by an unpopular government trying to keep power amid an economic implosion.By year\u2019s end, Venezuela\u2019s economy will have shrunk by nearly a third in the past four years\u2014a plunge similar to Cuba\u2019s after the fall of the Soviet Union, and one rarely seen outside of conflict zones. In a nation estimated to be sitting on as much oil as Saudi Arabia, it is common to see poor families rummaging through garbage for food, even as the wealthy pack nearby gourmet restaurants.Inflation was estimated by the International Monetary Fund at 720% this year; it is expected to surpass 2,000% next year. Shortages are so acute that three out of four Venezuelans lost an average of 18 pounds last year, according to a survey by Venezuelan universities. Diseases not seen there in decades, such as malaria, are back.\u201cThe government is desperate because they know the next presidential election will be their last,\u201d says       C\u00e9sar Miguel Rond\u00f3n,        a popular radio host. When the host recently tried to leave Venezuela on a business trip to Miami with his family, he had his passport seized. \u201cI\u2019m a hostage in my own country,\u201d he said.Amid the economic crisis and protests, the government has headed down an increasingly authoritarian path. It has raised the number of political prisoners over the past year to 391, according to the Venezuelan human-rights group Foro Penal\u2014nearly four times the total from a year ago. Most are being tried in military courts. And the government is seeking to remove its rebellious attorney general through a case in the supreme court. The government didn\u2019t answer requests for comment.The so-called Bolivarian revolution has become less about ideology and more about money. Venezuelans often call it a \u201croboluci\u00f3n\u201d rather than a \u201crevoluci\u00f3n,\u201d using the Spanish word for robbery. If Cuba is an ideologically motivated communist dictatorship, Venezuela is something different: as oil-rich as Saudi Arabia, as authoritarian as Russia and as corrupt as Nigeria.Spectacular accusations of drug trafficking and corruption have sullied Mr. Maduro\u2019s own family. Two nephews of Venezuela\u2019s first lady,       Cilia Flores,        are awaiting sentencing in New York after being found guilty last year of conspiring to import 800 kilos of cocaine to the U.S. through Honduras. They pleaded not guilty.The interior minister, Gen. N\u00e9stor Reverol, has been indicted in the U.S. for drug trafficking; Vice President       Tareck El Aissami       is on the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s kingpin list for allegedly protecting drug traffickers; and the head of Venezuela\u2019s supreme court is on another Treasury blacklist for gutting the country\u2019s democratic institutions. They all say that they are innocent and accuse the U.S. of trying to destabilize Venezuela.In some ways, analysts say, the extent of these accusations has made a negotiated solution to Venezuela\u2019s crisis more difficult. \u201cThe regime\u2019s connection to crime and drugs is what makes it difficult for them to give up power,\u201d says       Harold Trinkunas,        an expert on Venezuela at Stanford University. \u201cMany have to be worried that if they step down, they will be put on a plane to the U.S.\u201dIn Cuba, the Castro dynasty has kept power despite decades of disastrous economic policies due to devotion to the charismatic Fidel, popular achievements such as universal free health care, ideological loyalty to Marxism, discipline enforced by security forces, and the nationalist frisson of facing off against the U.S. In Venezuela, aside from a similar devotion to Mr. Ch\u00e1vez, the glue that has held the regime together is simpler: oil-soaked corruption on an epic scale.Former planning minister       Jorge Giordani,        one of Mr. Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s closest confidantes, said in 2015 that of an estimated $1 trillion in oil revenue received during the Ch\u00e1vez years, two-thirds had been distributed to workers through subsidies and cash transfers. The rest, more than $300 billion, had \u201cfallen through the cracks,\u201d he said. Mr. Giordani quit Mr. Maduro\u2019s government in disgust in 2014 and now lives in a quiet neighborhood of Caracas.This year, the U.S. Treasury Department put       Samark L\u00f3pez,        a Venezuelan businessman, on a blacklist, accusing him of being a frontman for Vice President El Aissami, an alleged drug trafficker. Announcing the seizure, Treasury Secretary       Steven Mnuchin       said that the U.S. had frozen assets worth \u201ctens of millions\u201d of dollars when it seized a slew of properties and firms owned or controlled by Mr. L\u00f3pez in the U.S., the U.K. and elsewhere. In a statement, Mr. L\u00f3pez denied any wrongdoing and called the accusations \u201cpolitically motivated.\u201dThe government didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment, but in the past, Mr. Maduro and other officials have dismissed accusations of corruption, economic mismanagement and repression as part of an \u201ceconomic war\u201d being waged by Venezuela\u2019s private sector, in cahoots with the U.S., to destabilize and overthrow the socialist government.As in many petrostates, oil accounts for 95% of Venezuela\u2019s foreign-currency earnings. Since the government administers the oil, one sure way to get ahead is not by creating a new business but by getting close to the government to secure access to oil rents. Venezuelans call the enterprising class following this model \u201clos enchufados\u201d\u2014the plugged-in ones.The path to power in Venezuela is often said to run through the army and oil. Once in power, the populist Mr. Ch\u00e1vez went after the oil, eventually firing 19,000 employees of the state-run oil firm Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela to stack the company with his yes-men. After a brief and unsuccessful coup against him in 2002, he also cleaned out the barracks, handing over indoctrination and training to his Cuban allies.\u2018Oil prices rose sharply, and Ch\u00e1vez spent lavishly.\u2019In the following years, oil prices rose sharply, and Mr. Ch\u00e1vez spent lavishly. He saved none of the windfall, ran large budget deficits even at peak-oil prices, raided the country\u2019s rainy-day oil fund, and borrowed heavily, first from Wall Street and then from the Chinese and the Russians. He handed out billions of dollars worth of cut-rate oil to Cuba, Nicaragua and even Boston and London to show off Venezuela\u2019s growing energy clout.The number of government employees doubled, to five million, and spending skyrocketed. Printing so much money caused inflation, so the government set prices, sometimes below the cost of production. Companies that refused to sell at a loss were seized, aggravating shortages. Less local production made the country ever more reliant on imports.But once the price of oil began to drop in 2014, Venezuela could no longer afford the imports, which have fallen from $66 billion in 2012 to about $15.5 billion this year. And there is little domestic industry left to pick up the slack.\u201cIt is classic Latin American populism on steroids, and now we have the worst hangover in history,\u201d said       Juan Nagel,        a Venezuelan economist living in Chile.Beyond some new public housing, little was built. Mr. Ch\u00e1vez left Venezuela littered with the bones of ambitious, half-finished public-works projects. Among them was a $20 billion scheme to build a train network, which now lies abandoned. In Caracas, a new subway line ended up being just one additional stop on an existing line, prompting local wags to call it the Centi Metro (centimeter) rather than just a plain Metro.Unperturbed, the flamboyant leader focused on projects like changing Venezuela\u2019s time zone by half an hour. He renamed the country the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. And to mark the shift in Venezuela\u2019s political course, he changed the direction of a wild stallion on the country\u2019s coat of arms, making the horse gallop left instead of right.Mr. Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s revolution attacked the old elites, sending nearly two million Venezuelans\u2014and billions of dollars\u2014packing in the past 10 years. But in their stead rose a new elite: the so-called Boliburgueses, or Bolivarian bourgeoisie, who enjoyed a life of premium wines, Scotches and cars as poverty levels rose.\u2018These guys literally bought the homes where Venezuela\u2019s elite lived, tore them down and built even bigger ones.\u2019\u201cYou don\u2019t see that in Cuba or Vietnam. But here, you see Hummers, private jets and obscene new mansions,\u201d says       Miguel Pizarro,        an opposition leader whose father was a Marxist guerrilla in Venezuela and whose mother served in Mr. Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s first political party in the mid-1990s. \u201cThese guys literally bought the homes where Venezuela\u2019s elite lived, tore them down and built even bigger ones.\u201dFew enjoyed la dolce vita of Caracas more than       Wilmer Ruperti,        a businessman who earned Mr. Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s loyalty in 2002 when he helped break an oil strike. Mr. Ruperti was a familiar sight in Caracas, riding in an armored Jaguar accompanied by two North Korean bodyguards. The magnate cemented his friendship with Mr. Ch\u00e1vez by buying a pair of       Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar\u2019s       pistols for $1.7 million in a New York auction and presenting them to the Venezuelan leader.Last year, Mr. Ruperti paid the multimillion-dollar legal fees for the criminal defense of Mr. Maduro\u2019s nephews. At the same time, Mr. Ruperti\u2019s firm won a $138 million contract from the state oil company. Mr. Ruperti said it was his patriotic duty to pay the nephews\u2019 legal fees as a way of relieving the pressures on Mr. Maduro. He denied any link between the payment of the fees and the state oil-firm contract.Corruption helps the government maintain political control. And no tool has been more effective than exchange controls, initially adopted by Mr. Ch\u00e1vez in 2002 during a national strike to control capital flight. Fifteen years later, they have reshaped Venezuela\u2019s economy and given the government enormous power to pick who gets dollars from the country\u2019s oil wealth\u2014often at absurdly low rates.For instance, firms and others who import food get dollars at the official rate of 10 bolivars. But they can turn around and sell those dollars on the black market for 8,300 bolivars.Venezuela\u2019s army recently got the rights to set up its own mining and oil companies, and the armed forces are in charge of most critical imports. In 2016, 18 generals and admirals were tasked with importing key foods and sanitary items. One brigadier general was put in command of acquiring black beans; another was charged with acquiring toilet paper, feminine napkins and diapers. Logically, an admiral was placed in charge of acquiring fish.No one knows how much money has been lost. Mr. Giordani estimated that a third of the $59 billion that the government handed out to companies to bring imports into the country in 2012 might have ended up in fraudulent schemes.\u201cIt\u2019s a terrible economic model, but it\u2019s great for politics and power,\u201d says       Asdr\u00fabal Oliveros,        a prominent Venezuelan economist.The opposition and the regional governments don\u2019t know how to turn the tide. An Organization of American States resolution this week urging Venezuela to return to democracy was supported by every major country in the hemisphere but blocked by Venezuelan allies like Nicaragua and a handful of statelets like St. Kitts and Nevis.Many in Venezuela hope that parts of the army haven\u2019t been tempted by money and will want to honor the country\u2019s democratic past.       Ibsen Mart\u00ednez,        who helped write some of the country\u2019s most beloved soap operas, says that hope is likely in vain.\u201cThe army is now a criminal organization,\u201d he said in an interview from Bogot\u00e1, where he now lives in exile. \u201cBut in every culture, there are mythical creatures. In Venezuela, it is the idea of an institutional military man, who will come out like Captain America to resolve everything.\u201d That instinct, he added, led to Mr. Ch\u00e1vez in the first place.His revolution\u2019s mournful impact can be seen everywhere. Venezuela\u2019s national baseball league now plays to empty stadiums and is considering suspending this year\u2019s season. The Teresa Carre\u00f1o theater, an architectural masterpiece in Caracas, used to produce some of the region\u2019s best operas and dramas; it now mostly hosts government rallies. In the nearby Caracas Museum of Contemporary Art, water drips into buckets near paintings by Picasso and Mondrian. The museum is so empty that a thief replaced a Matisse portrait with a fake without anyone noticing for several years.Alberto Barrera,        the author of a biography of Mr. Ch\u00e1vez who now lives in Mexico City, thinks that the time is fast approaching when he and the opposition may need to say goodbye to their hopes. \u201cI wonder when I will wake up and realize, \u2018They beat us.\u2019 That it\u2019s all over and the country I knew is gone,\u201d he said.Appeared in the June 24, 2017, print edition as 'Venezuela\u2019s Sinister Turn.'", "news_time": "2017-06-23 13:52:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-last-battle-for-democracy-in-venezuela-1498240335", "news_title": "\u2018The Last Battle for Democracy in Venezuela\u2019", "keywords": "corruption,cuba,democracy ,hugo chavez,latin america,national assembly, national constitutional assembly,nicolas maduro,petroleos de venezuela,venezuela,Hugo Ch\u00e1vez,Nicol\u00e1s Maduro,political,general news,society,community,crime,legal action,international relations,financial crime,politics,domestic politics,poverty,regional politics,social issues,welfare,social services"}, {"content": "S\u00c3O PAULO\u2014Brazil\u2019s agriculture minister promised Friday to take the measures necessary to reopen the U.S. market after the U.S. Department of Agriculture suspended imports of Brazilian beef over concerns about its safety.The decision by the USDA, announced Thursday, came after Brazil suspended beef exports to the U.S. from five Brazilian slaughterhouses. Some of the beef from those abattoirs was found to have abscesses caused by a vaccine against foot-and-mouth disease. Brazil\u2019s agriculture ministry said the abscesses aren\u2019t a health risk.Brazilian agriculture minister Blairo Maggi said he is ready to travel to the U.S. to hold talks to re-establish exports. Mr. Maggi said in a statement there has been \u201cstrong pressure\u201d from U.S. beef producers to block beef from Brazil, but added the Brazilian government agrees with the U.S. position and intends to correct the problems.The ministry said it would introduce more rigorous inspections, and will make changes to the foot-and-mouth vaccine to try to avoid the problem with abscesses, among other actions.\u201cWe have to fight [to resume exports] because it\u2019s an important market,\u201d Mr. Maggi said.The USDA had no immediate response for comment Friday.The USDA said Thursday that since the agency began analyzing all meat shipments from the country in March inspectors have rejected about 11% of Brazilian fresh beef products because of \u201cpublic health concerns, sanitary conditions, and animal health issues.\u201dThe rate of rejection of beef shipments from the rest of the world is only 1%, the USDA said.Beef from Brazil, one of the world\u2019s biggest exporters of the meat, came under increased scrutiny three months ago after the Brazilian authorities unveiled a corruption probe targeting food inspectors.Brazil\u2019s biggest agricultural association, National Confederation of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry, questioned the USDA\u2019s reasons for the suspension, saying the issues pose no risk to Americans\u2019 health.\u201cWe hope the U.S. government will divulge the technical and scientific justifications upon which they based the decision, which can also be seen as a protectionist measure,\u201d the group said in a statement.The U.S. only allowed imports of fresh Brazilian beef to resume last year after a 13-year ban, and is still a small market for the South American country\u2019s cattlemen. The U.S. only bought 3% of Brazilian beef exports in the first five months of this year, according to exporters group Abiec.The biggest potential problem for the Brazilian beef industry is that other countries representing much bigger markets will also ban imports, said       Kevin Good,        senior market analyst at Colorado-based Cattlefax, a producer-owned organization that deals primarily with analyzing beef and other animal protein markets.\u201cYou could see more damage if there\u2019s a lack of confidence from other export markets,\u201d said Mr. Good. \u201cThat\u2019s the risk, is there a domino effect or not.\u201dWhen the investigation of sanitary inspectors was announced in March, China, the European Union and other countries issued temporary bans or increased scrutiny on Brazilian meat shipments. No countries have announced new bans since the USDA\u2019s announcement Thursday.Shares of Brazilian meatpackers             JBS SA       and             Marfrig Global Foods SA       declined Friday.JBS, the world\u2019s biggest animal protein producer, was down 1.6% in early afternoon trading. Marfrig had fallen 0.6% at the same time, while meatpacker             Minerva SA\u2019s       shares were up 0.6% after falling 2.2% in early trading. Shares in U.S. meat producers rose Friday, with             Tyson Foods Inc.       and             Hormel Foods Corp.       both up around 2%.Write to Jeffrey T.

I was suffering from high blood pressure and high cholesterol and consulted fellow doctors and nutritionists. Everyone seemed to have a different answer. But everything began to change as I came to know Bapan, China\u2014a place I read about after it was featured in a medical journal. It\u2019s known as \u201cLongevity Village\u201d due to its concentration of older residents. With a population of about 550, it has around one centenarian for every 100 people living there. The average ratio of centenarians in the U.S. is 1 in 5,780.In Bapan, people age very slowly and don\u2019t struggle with obesity; villagers in their 90s and even 100s are often still out in their gardens and farms. There is virtually no heart disease or cancer. Dementia is all but unheard of.To be honest, I found all of this a bit destabilizing. It stood in stark contrast to much of what I\u2019d learned in medical school. I\u2019d been taught that chronic medical problems were just part of aging and that we can treat them with medications and surgeries. In this way of looking at life, a painful decline was pretty much inevitable. All we could do was make it more tolerable.So what do the villagers of Bapan do to live such long, healthy lives? A good diet free of added sugars and processed foods naturally plays a role, as does physical activity. The older residents of Longevity Village never intended to exercise, but they did get exercise\u2014lots of it. Almost every waking moment of their lives was spent in motion. But I also discovered that some simple changes in mind-set can help, too.Smile more. Mawen, who told me she was 107 years old when we first met, was feisty, funny and always smiling. When I asked if she smiled even through the hard times in her life, she replied, \u201cThose are the times in which smiling is most important, don\u2019t you agree?\u201d One clever study published in Psychological Science in 2010 showed that baseball players who smiled in their playing card photographs lived seven years longer, on average, than those who looked stern. So the next time you\u2019re standing in front of a mirror, grin at yourself. Then make that a habit.Rethink stress. At least 70% of all visits to the doctor are estimated to be for stress-related ailments such as high blood pressure, chest pain or palpitations. Rachel Lampert of Yale University has found that feelings of sadness, anger, stress, impatience or anxiousness increase a person\u2019s risk of suffering from atrial fibrillation nearly 600%.But among the people of Bapan, I found an exceptionally low level of perceived stress. One day, I found myself picking vegetables with a man named Li Yu, who told me he was 50 years old. When I mentioned that working in the field seemed like difficult work, he said, \u201cIt is hard work. By the time I am back at my home, though, I don\u2019t think about how hard it is. I am always feeling satisfied about what I have accomplished during the day.\u201dDon\u2019t forget to play. Many of us spend at least some of our lives engaged in exercise and athletics, but most of us don\u2019t play. The villagers incorporated play throughout their days. Mawen, for instance, told me about the ad-libbed songs that she and her husband would sing as they worked in the fields. You can add play even in small ways. When I\u2019m on call, I am often running from one end of the hospital to the other. Now, to make it a game, I try to see how many steps I can log on my iPhone.Look forward to aging. In a study of 660 older Americans published in 2002 in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, researchers found that regardless of socioeconomic status or even age, people who embraced the aging process and felt like life would continue to get better lived nearly eight years longer than those with a more pessimistic view. Indeed, all of the centenarians I\u2019ve spoken to in Bapan told me that they are living the best years of their lives. Looking forward to later years that could be truly golden might be one of the best things you can do for your health.\u2014Dr. Day is a cardiologist at the Intermountain Medical Center Heart Institute in Salt Lake City.

But telecommunications companies are losing their power to raise prices for using their networks, in part because the U.S. cellphone market is nearing saturation. That has kicked off a vicious price war among the four national wireless carriers.The consumer-price index for wireless phone service, an indicator of current offers from cellphone service providers, dropped 12.5% in May from a year ago, according to the Labor Department. The index earlier fell 13% in April, the largest decline in the history of the category, prompting Federal Reserve Chairwoman       Janet Yellen       to say earlier this month it was a factor in the country\u2019s low inflation.Beyond the consumer impact, the rapid collapse in the industry\u2019s pricing power will ripple through its profit margins, federal regulations and antitrust law.T-Mobile US Inc.        TMUS 0.94%       and             Sprint Corp.        S -0.47%      , the third and fourth largest carriers, recently rekindled talks about a merger, according to people familiar with the matter. The two previously discussed combining in 2014 but backed down in the face of regulatory opposition.The rout could continue when the many consumers who haven\u2019t felt the effects of price drops, unaware they can lower their monthly bills, call their carriers to demand better deals.Selina Sosa, who runs a nonprofit near Dallas, cut her monthly bill by about a third in less than six months. Last December, she switched carriers from             AT&T Inc.        T 0.39%       to             Verizon Communications Inc.,        VZ 0.21%       reducing her payment for three phones from $330 to $279.In April, Ms. Sosa called Verizon with a billing question and an agent offered to switch her into an unlimited-data plan and lower her monthly bill by another $57. \u201cI didn\u2019t even ask to reduce my payment,\u201d she said, adding she was relieved to save the extra cash.Six years ago, the number of active cellphones surpassed the U.S. population. About 80% of Americans currently own a smartphone, according to CTIA, an industry trade group. Many have multiple devices. Consumers are also keeping their smartphones for longer periods, which means fewer customers are up for grabs.4%All items0\u20134Wireless services\u20138", "news_time": "2017-06-23 13:48:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-new-sticker-shock-plunging-cellphone-bills-1498232910", "news_title": "The New Sticker Shock: Plunging Cellphone Bills", "keywords": "cellphone,cellphone bills, data caps, unlimited data,Verizon Communications,VZ,AT&T,T,Sprint,S,T-Mobile US,TMUS,financial performance,earnings,marketing,markets,pricing,anti-competition issues,corporate,industrial news,computers,consumer electronics,telecommunications technology,equipment,mobile communications equipment,personal electronics,cellular,mobile phones,handheld electronic devices,technology"}, {"content": "Even in its shrunken state,             BlackBerry Ltd.        BBRY 2.63%       finds that $815 million goes only so far.That is how much BlackBerry was awarded in an arbitration dispute with             Qualcomm Inc.       two months ago. It isn\u2019t an insignificant sum, adding about 52% to the company\u2019s cash balance. Given BlackBerry\u2019s need to grow a fledgling software business to replace a rapidly disappearing handset and service fee enterprise, an unexpected boost to the company\u2019s war chest was taken as good news.Too good, as it turns out. BlackBerry\u2019s share price surged 44% since the announcement of the award up to its fiscal first-quarter results announcement Friday morning. That added about $1.1 billion in market value\u2014well in excess of the award\u2014and set up an inevitable disappointment when the results fell short of targets. BlackBerry\u2019s share price tumbled more than 12%.BlackBerry\u2019s focus is all on software these days, so the new funds can help the company invest in key growth areas, such as mobile-device management and the automotive market. But these are also markets targeted by much larger players such as             Citrix Systems Inc.,VMware Inc.       and             International Business Machines Corp.This leaves BlackBerry\u2019s valuation still looking risky.

That arresting full-length portrait of the artist\u2019s favorite model posed in a pink peignoir led to an eight-year infatuation as Mr. Reed revisited the painting whenever he could. \u201cI found myself drawn to the picture, resisted by it, and then drawn back,\u201d he writes. \u201cHow long, I mused, could I sustain this conversation?\u201d He discovered from that prolonged enchantment that a work of art could \u201cbehave like a moving picture,\u201d offering an experience \u201cas rich and as thorny as any literary or philosophical text.\u201dSubsequent encounters with works by other artists closer to our time, like       Hiroshi Sugimoto       and       James Turrell      \u2014both of whom make art that compels rapt attention or \u201cat least cultivates patience\u201d\u2014led him to write a book-length study called \u201cSlow Art: The Experience of Looking, Sacred Images to James Turrell.\u201d And the reader thinks, Well, why not? Especially as we\u2019ve recently had books and movements devoted to slow food and slow sex, with sage advice about lingering over experiences even as the culture at large speeds up (so much so that, as the author points out, the average American museumgoer spends about 6 to 10 seconds with any work of art).Slow art, in Mr. Reed\u2019s definition, names not a set of aesthetic objects but rather a prolonged \u201cencounter between object and observer,\u201d and what in another writer\u2019s hands might have been a dry academic treatise turns out to be a lively ramble through high and low culture, touching on the likes of       Diderot,       Goethe,       David Foster Wallace,       Susan Sontag,        Sleeping Beauty, the       Countess de Castiglione       and       Andy Warhol.As background to a history of slow art, the author describes and even takes part in the annual Pageant of the Masters in Laguna Beach, Calif., a summer festival of tableaux vivants that began in 1933 and is now going stronger than ever. Tableaux vivants, for the uninitiated, are \u201cliving pictures\u201d: full-dress stage spectacles\u2014silent, motionless and theatrically lit\u2014with actors holding poses for 90 seconds or so. These elaborately presented scenes are traditionally \u201cre-creations\u201d of well-known masterpieces (the Laguna Beach theatricals always end with Leonardo\u2019s \u201cLast Supper\u201d). \u201cThe Pageant projects art into the world of an everyday Orange County evening, even as it sets art apart in a frame,\u201d Mr. Reed tells us. \u201cStaging fabricates illusions that satisfy our spectatorial hunger, even as actors unmask the fakery in bodying it forth.\u201dBy Arden ReedCalifornia, 325 pages, $60For Mr. Reed, tableaux vivants \u201coccupy the point of intersection between slowing and accelerating that is the very locus of slow art.\u201d As such, they become the fulcrum for much of the author\u2019s discussion of slow art through the ages. Tableaux vivants flourished from about 1760 and waned in the 1910s. Slow art entered what Mr. Reed calls a \u201csecond golden age\u201d beginning around 1960, with paintings by       Agnes Martin       and       Ad Reinhardt,        earthworks including       Michael Heizer\u2019s       \u201cDouble Negative\u201d and Mr. Turrell\u2019s \u201cRoden Crater,\u201d and video art from Warhol to       Bill Viola.Before all that, of course, there was the art of early Christianity, icons and other objects of religious devotion that demanded slow looking and veneration from viewers. Later, religious processions pulled out all the stops by including floats featuring tableaux vivants of familiar scenes from Bible stories, like the Return of the Prodigal Son or the Crucifixion. Yet the advent of \u201ctrue\u201d slow art occurred only about 250 years ago because, the author argues, the experience of \u201cunprecedented speed led people to seek breathers, breaks and oases\u2014if only to prevent cognitive and emotional fatigue.\u201d The Enlightenment philosophe Denis Diderot was one of its first apostles, championing tableaux vivants as a way to show people how to comport themselves, and painters responded, whether in the homely parables of       Jean-Baptiste Greuze       or the high-minded neoclassical scenes of       Jacques-Louis David.       In a campier vein (and camp finds its way into slow art, in proponents as disparate as Sontag and       Oscar Wilde      ), David\u2019s near contemporary Lady       Emma Hamilton,        the foxy wife of the British envoy to the court of the Two Sicilies and mistress of Adm.       Horatio Nelson,        amused her admirers with solo tableaux in which she donned a Grecian costume and performed \u201csurprising transformations, standing, kneeling, sitting, reclining, serious, sad, playful, ecstatic, contrite, alluring, threatening, anxious,\u201d one pose following another without a break, according to Goethe.Some of the most entertaining, and probably little known, of Mr. Reed\u2019s examples of slow art evolved in the 19th century, when the stereopticon, a device that transforms two-dimensional images into three-dimensional ones, became a popular and affordable amusement. This proto-View-Master \u201cenabled viewers to experience images as events\u201d and its influence extended well into the present in the works of photographers including       Jeff Wall.       Wax museums were another diversion available to the masses, and Mr. Reed ably chronicles how their development, culminating in Madame Tussaud\u2019s still popular worldwide emporiums, made for another offshoot of the tableau vivant.When he arrives at the history of more recent art, Mr. Reed takes us from Malevich to Serra, with generous stops along the way to consider slow art in the fiction of       Don DeLillo,        performances by Marina Abramovi\u0107, the films of       Jean-Luc Godard,        the paintings of       Joseph Marioni       and       Tony Conrad,        and videos by       Eve Sussman       and       Sam Taylor-Johnson.       If this sounds like a massive catalogue of artists, it is. But the author gives each their due, and makes the reader curious to see more (a list of links is provided in the book). His descriptions of \u201cRoden Crater\u201d and       Walter De Maria\u2019s       \u201cLightning Field\u201d are more leisurely, perhaps because he has spent enough time with both to give a vivid firsthand account of two major earthworks few of us will ever see. \u201cThe Lightning Field reads as an enormous tableau vivant,\u201d he writes, \u201cbecause it stages a landscape painting. . . . The actors are the four hundred [lightning] rods. Perhaps because of their verticality, they feel slightly anthropomorphic, as if they were sentinels. Like human actors, the poles sway slightly in the breeze. But we are likewise actors, performing De Maria\u2019s installation together with time, light, and weather.\u201dMr. Reed is an enormously erudite writer, but his many references to cultural touchstones of all ages, familiar and recondite, never leave the reader in the dust. You\u2019ll have arguments with this book: Why don\u2019t certain Renaissance painters, like Leonardo and       Raphael,        qualify as \u201cslow\u201d? Why wasn\u2019t Christian Marclay\u2019s epic video \u201cThe Clock\u201d included? And what, precisely, did Mr. Reed gain from all that time with Manet\u2019s \u201cYoung Lady\u201d?But your way of looking at many kinds of art and entertainment will also be subtly affected, whether it\u2019s the Ghent Altarpiece or a Warhol silkscreen. I, for one, became convinced that tableaux vivants, one way or another, foreshadow the breathtaking slo-mo sequences in \u201cWonder Woman.\u201d\u2014Ms. Landi writes about art and culture from Taos, N.M.", "news_time": "2017-06-23 13:38:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/taking-art-slow-1498239526", "news_title": "Taking Art Slow", "keywords": "bookcar0624,book review,recommended books,books,political,general news,arts,entertainment,reviews"}, {"content": "Two people sitting in a car were fatally shot on Friday morning in Brooklyn, the New York Police Department said.Police identified the victims as 27-year-old       Devon Hannibal,        of Brooklyn, and 23-year-old       Christina Stubbs,        of Pompano Beach, Fla.

One might have expected him also to be involved with \u201cThe Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,\u201d written up by Robert Louis Stevenson in 1886. There appears to be a gap in our records of crime in Victorian London. Now it has been filled by Theodora Goss\u2019s \u201cThe Strange Case of the Alchemist\u2019s Daughter\u201d (Saga, 402 pages, $24.99).Apart from Holmes and Watson, the important figures here are the sisters Mary Jekyll and Diana Hyde, assisted by three other escapees from the shadows of fiction. If you can believe H.G. Wells, Dr. Moreau must have been active in Holmes\u2019s London before he fled to his lonely island. His project of turning beasts into humans came to a disastrous end, but not with total finality. The man Moreau rescued, Prendick, escaped with his knowledge.Moreau and Jekyll were moreover not the only experimenters with life in the fictional 1800s. Could Justine Moritz have been brought back to life by a guilty Victor Frankenstein, in a different body? And perhaps also the poison girl, Rappaccini\u2019s daughter, in the Nathaniel Hawthorne story of 1844? Both might have made their way to London.In which case, murders taking place in the London slums, accompanied by organ-removal, might be motivated not by sadism but by further grisly attempts at life-renewal. Slowly Holmes and Mary Jekyll realize that there is a Society of Alchemists still operating, and Mary finds herself the nucleus of a female society determined to stop them: the daughters and the creatures of the experimenters, several of them with unusual powers. They call themselves the Athena Club, after the goddess born from her father\u2019s head.Clearly they will have further work to do.

Once driverless cars are on the roads in large numbers, they say, there will be no need for traffic lights because the vehicles will be able to communicate with each other to time when they go through the intersection. The cars will intuitively know what\u2019s a safe speed to travel based on traffic and road conditions. And human errors such as failing to stop at a stop sign or mistakenly driving through a red light will become nonissues.\u201cSelf-driving vehicles are constantly monitoring the roads, and they\u2019re never drunk or distracted,\u201d says       Brandon Schoettle,        a researcher at the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute who studies autonomous driving.Of course, it remains to be seen whether the safety benefits will pan out as expected and when they will begin. Researchers say it depends on how quickly driverless technology evolves, how long it takes the public to embrace self-driving cars and what happens in the interim\u2014when autonomous cars and those driven by humans are sharing the roads.\u201cThere are a huge number of unknowns,\u201d says Mr. Schoettle, who predicts it could be a decade before self-driving vehicles are available for sale and an additional 20 to 30 years before most drivers own them.\u201cThere might be some positives and negatives\u201d during the transition, Mr. Schoettle says, but \u201cthe real huge benefit is very far down the road when autonomous vehicles become the norm.\u201dLast year, the federal government announced guidelines for the development of autonomous vehicles, and the Transportation Department says it is currently reviewing and updating the policy to incorporate feedback from numerous stakeholders. The department under the Obama administration also set a goal to eliminate all traffic fatalities within 30 years, aided by the deployment of self-driving cars. Cities including Chicago and Boston have made similar pledges, vowing to eliminate traffic fatalities and severe injuries within certain time frames.Swedish auto maker         Volvo               Car Corp. has taken it a step further, going so far as to say its new vehicles will be deathproof by 2020, with autonomous-driving technology propelling the way.\u201cNobody should be killed [while driving],\u201d Lex Kerssemakers, head of Volvo\u2019s North American operations, said in an interview in April. \u201cWe have all the technology available\u201d to eliminate traffic deaths.Such promises are welcome news at a time when motor-vehicle fatalities are on the rise. The National Safety Council says there were 40,200 traffic fatalities in the U.S. last year, up 6% from 2015 and up 14% from 2014, the sharpest two-year escalation in more than a half-century. The nonprofit group says that while it is too early to pinpoint specific causes for the increase, speeding, drunken driving and texting while driving probably played a role.As auto makers introduce crash-avoidance technologies such as automatic braking and blind-spot detection into new cars, traffic fatalities and injuries in theory should be decreasing. A 2015 study by the Boston Consulting Group suggested that advanced driver-assistance systems could prevent 28% of all crashes and 9,900 fatalities in the U.S. if new-car buyers invested in such systems.The problem is, while cars today are safer than they\u2019ve ever been, people are driving distracted more than ever and feel comfortable texting and eating in their vehicles, says       Dave Sullivan,        an automotive analyst at AutoPacific Inc. \u201cI think as long as humans are involved, we will always have accidents,\u201d he says.Almost all auto makers are investing in self-driving vehicles, some on their own and some through partnerships with companies like Waymo LLC, the self-driving car unit of Google parent         Alphabet Inc.,       and Uber Technologies Inc.Tesla Inc.       already is introducing features in its electric cars that allow them to drive themselves at times, but don\u2019t render them fully autonomous. Others, like             Ford Motor Co.       and Waymo, want to take drivers fully out of the equation by removing the steering wheel.Tesla\u2019s Autopilot, the semiautonomous driving system that allows Tesla\u2019s cars to steer, brake, cruise and change lanes on their own under certain conditions, came under scrutiny last year after a driver using the technology was killed in a collision with a tractor-trailer on a Florida highway. The NHTSA found no defects in the system\u2019s automatic emergency braking and forward-collision warning features, and suggested the driver could have anticipated the crash and had time to react.\u201cThere will never be zero fatalities,\u201d Tesla Chief Executive       Elon Musk       said on a conference call in September. \u201cThe world is a very big place and there\u2019s a huge number of people and a huge number of circumstances. It\u2019s really just about minimizing the probability of death, not the illusion of perfect safety.\u201dAs the Tesla crash demonstrated, it may be difficult to determine who or what is responsible for a crash when a vehicle takes over key driver functions. And that leads into another big unknown surrounding driverless cars: How long will it take for the public to warm to them?In addition to the trust factor there is the issue of cost, especially at a time when Americans are holding on to their cars longer than ever before. The average age of cars and light trucks hit 11.6 years old in 2016, according to IHS Markit, and is expected to continue to increase as the quality of vehicles improves over time. So even after self-driving technology is fully developed, mass adoption of autonomous vehicles still could be a long way off.Ms. Roberts is a Wall Street Journal reporter in Detroit.

The first is among the most fascinating popular-science books I\u2019ve read in a long while, and the other two are consistently provocative. But like that Veg-o-Matic on the shelf, it\u2019s unclear how useful the whole package will be in the end.Mr. West is a particle physicist whose career was disrupted in 1993 when Congress, with the acquiescence of President       Bill Clinton,        canceled the Superconducting Super Collider, an enormous particle accelerator that had been in the works for years. The end of the SSC marked the end of U.S. dominance in physics; thousands of Ph.D.s saw their research programs turn to ash. Mr. West, then director of the particle-physics program at Los Alamos National Laboratory, switched to biology and after that, more boldly, to the study of society.Beginning in the late 1990s, Mr. West and a raft of collaborators argued in a series of articles that a single phenomenon called \u201cscaling\u201d could explain many of the fundamental properties of living organisms. In some sense, this is no surprise. As far back as 1932, the Swiss physiologist Max Kleiber had noted that the metabolic rates of creatures of every sort\u2014the amount of energy they need to stay alive\u2014exhibit what Mr. West calls \u201can extraordinarily systematic regularity.\u201dBy Geoffrey WestPenguin Press, 479 pages, $30The regularity is shown most commonly by drawing a special kind of graph, in which every increment on the x- and y-axis is 10 times bigger than the previous increment\u2014instead of running from 1 to 2 to 3 and so on, the increments run from 1 to 10 to 100 and so on. When organisms\u2019 metabolic rates are plotted on the vertical axis and their mass on the horizontal one, the result is a dead- straight line\u2014a relationship that holds true for animals as tiny as a mouse (typical weight, .02 kilograms) and as enormous as an African elephant (typical weight, 6,500 kilograms).This is a scaling law: a relationship between two quantities that holds true at many orders of magnitude. In this case, every species\u2019 metabolic rate \u201cscales\u201d with increasing size. After Kleiber, researchers found that his rule holds true for fish, amphibians, insects and plants\u2014indeed, for every creature from the smallest microorganisms to the biggest whale. \u201cOverall,\u201d Mr. West says, this relationship \u201cencompasses an astonishing twenty-seven orders of magnitude, perhaps the most persistent and systematic scaling law in the universe.\u201d And the correspondence is no isolated phenomenon. \u201cSimilar systematic scaling laws hold for almost any physiological trait or life-history event across the entire range of life,\u201d Mr. West writes, including quantities as disparate as \u201cgenome lengths, lengths of aortas, tree heights, the amount of cerebral gray matter in the brain, evolutionary rates, and life spans.\u201dThis is remarkable. It was as if Mr. West and his colleagues had discovered that the number of doors, bathrooms and chimneys in every building in the world\u2014a Mongolian yurt, a Cairo apartment and       Tom Brady\u2019s       moat-surrounded castle in Los Angeles\u2014were described by a single mathematical rule that specified details down to the number of doorknobs. For real estate, the idea is ridiculous. But not, it seemed, for biology.With two colleagues, Mr. West proposed an explanation in 1997. Roughly speaking, they said that our bodies, like those of every other living creature, are bags of cells. These cells are in some ways surprisingly similar; all must be nourished and directed, and most of them are about the same size, no matter what species they belong to (a few exceptions exist, like brain and fat cells). Thus living things must contain networks\u2014blood vessels, plant veins and so on\u2014that distribute energy, materials and information to cells. Because the cellular endpoints of every network are all about the same size, the \u201cterminal units\u201d of the distributive system must also be about the same size. That is to say, the capillaries (the smallest blood vessels) of all mammals are roughly the same size, as are those of every fish and insect, as are the endpoint veins of leaves and a host of other things.Big species need more nutrients and energy than small ones, so the network centers\u2014the heart, for mammalian blood systems; the big xylem at the roots, for vascular plants\u2014vary in dimension. Because the endpoints are always the same small size, the network needs to consist of what Mr. West calls a \u201chierarchical branching network structure,\u201d with big branches unraveling tree-like into smaller ones. But when the big tubes divide into smaller tubes, the branch points will cause eddies or otherwise interfere with the flow\u2014unless they obey certain precise physical properties. Unsurprisingly, evolution keeps nudging organisms toward those properties, which again are similar for every species, because they depend on physical laws that are independent of biology.As physicists do, Mr. West and his collaborators looted this new understanding to produce all kinds of eyebrow-raising results. That blood pressures in the various branches of the network are the same for every mammal, regardless of size. That the lengths of successive blood vessel branches in every species must decrease by a single constant factor. That the volume of blood in every species is a constant proportion of the body volume, regardless of size. That measures ranging from lung volume to the pumping action of the heart to the frequency of breathing are all covered by scaling laws.A certain type of reader (me, for example) will find this stuff fascinating\u2014I kept underlining phrases and putting exclamation points in the margins. And this kept going as Mr. West showed how fractals (structures like snowflakes, in which similar patterns repeat at progressively smaller scales) and network dynamics govern birth, growth and development, again in species of every sort. But then, around page 200, \u201cScale\u201d takes a radical shift. Mr. West begins what amounts to a second book about social science, and here my exclamation points turned into question marks.There is a long, rich tradition of physicists contributing to biology. Physicist       Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s       \u201cWhat Is Life?\u201d (1944) was a major inspiration for molecular biology; DNA pioneers like       Francis Crick,        Max Delbr\u00fcck,       Walter Gilbert       and       Sidney Altman       began their careers as physicists (all won Nobels). When it comes to physicists\u2019 contribution to the human sciences, such as sociology and anthropology, the record is scantier. There\u2019s a reason for this disparity, and the later portions of \u201cScale\u201d highlight the limitations of the physicist\u2019s approach. Physicists attack problems by stripping them to their most fundamental parts and throwing away inessential details. In the case of metabolism, Kleiber and his successors ignored huge differences among mammals, birds, fish and bacteria and treated the whole lot as, in effect, having just two properties\u2014metabolic rate and mass.The approach was successful at explaining many observed physiological features of plants and animals. But the success isn\u2019t as clear-cut when Mr. West tries to create what he calls a \u201cScience of Cities.\u201d The author points out that modern cities, like bodies, depend on transportation and supply networks\u2014roads, gas lines, water conduits, electric cables. Because these networks must reach every home, they scale in a manner analogous to networks in the body. Ancillary quantities like the number of gas stations and power substations per capita also scale. So exact is this scaling that it leads Mr. West to contend that, \u201cdespite appearances cities are approximately scaled versions of one another: New York and Tokyo are, to a surprising and predictable degree, nonlinearly scaled-up versions respectively of San Francisco and Nagoya.\u201dIntriguingly, infrastructure per capita decreases with increasing city size\u2014that\u2019s the \u201cnonlinear\u201d in the previous sentence. Thus larger cities use fewer resources per person than smaller cities, and so Mr. West argues that \u201con average the bigger the city, the greener it is.\u201d Secure in their superior sustainability, New Yorkers have another reason to sneer at denizens of smaller places.More than that, Mr. West says, urban scaling laws appear in \u201cquantities with no analog in biology such as average wages, the number of professional people, the number of patents produced, the amount of crime, the number of restaurants, and the gross urban domestic product.\u201d Again, the exactitude of the scaling is remarkable. The relationship of urban GDP to population follows a scaling law, but so does something as seemingly unpredictable as the average walking speed of pedestrians in a city.Unlike the case of infrastructure, in which bigger cities end up with proportionately less, larger cities end up with proportionately more crime, pollution and disease. On the other hand, Mr. West says, \u201cthe bigger the city, the more each person earns, creates, innovates, and interacts.\u201d In general, he argues, bigger is better.Really? Mr. West is apparently suggesting cities get better indefinitely. Surely this cannot be correct\u2014it implies that diminishing returns do not apply. Congestion by itself drives up resource use. As buildings get packed together, for example, they need ever-larger systems to pump in fresh, conditioned air. Meanwhile, heating and ventilation systems pour out hot exhaust, creating the \u201cheat islands\u201d that are a familiar urban plague, and themselves drive up air-conditioning use even further\u2014a dyseconomy of scale of precisely the kind Mr. West seems not to take into account.El Paso, Texas, and Washington, D.C., have similar populations (about 680,000), so they are presumably similar in the physical attributes Mr. West measures. But the experience of living in each city is dramatically different. Washington (median household income, $70,848) is almost twice as wealthy as El Paso ($42,772). But FBI statistics show that El Paso has a murder rate of 2.5 per 100,000, and is one of the safest big U.S. cities, whereas Washington, D.C., with a murder rate of 24 per 100,000, is notorious for its unsafe areas.Environmentally, too, the cities are different: El Paso emits almost twice as much carbon dioxide as Washington. Yes, Washington has a big subway and El Paso has a struggling bus system. But that difference can be explained not by networking behavior but by politics, economics, geography and history\u2014factors that also contribute to the cities\u2019 different levels of crime and income. Does it make any sense to treat the cities as fungible?Despite the questions it raises, Mr. West\u2019s Book No. 2 is almost as interesting as Book No. 1. And toward the end of \u201cScale,\u201d Book No. 3 suddenly heaves into view. Not even 50 pages long, it consists of an abbreviated discussion of businesses, firms and corporations. Again, he asks a scaling question: \u201cIs Walmart a scaled-up Big Joe\u2019s Lumber?\u201d Again, the answer seems to be \u201cyes,\u201d but he is tentative about it. Still, in contrast to his science of cities, his proposed \u201cscience of companies\u201d seems promising. Companies, unlike cities, share a single goal: profit. And, like organisms, they are subject to relentless selection pressure, nudging them toward efficiency.One can imagine using scaling laws to evaluate the role of management or corporate structure, but the ultimate conclusions are still to come\u2014the subject, perhaps, of a sequel. I\u2019d look forward to reading that book. In the meantime, we have \u201cScale\u201d\u2014an overstuffed, often exhilarating, sometimes frustrating introduction to a new way of looking at life.\u2014Mr. Mann is the author of the forthcoming \u201cThe Wizard and the Prophet: Two Remarkable Scientists and Their Dueling Visions to Shape Tomorrow\u2019s World.\u201dAppeared in the June 24, 2017, print edition as 'Nature\u2019s Rules for Growth.'", "news_time": "2017-06-23 13:33:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-nature-scales-up-1498239216", "news_title": "How Nature Scales Up", "keywords": "bookcar0624,book review,recommended books,books,political,general news,arts,entertainment,sciences,humanities,reviews"}, {"content": "Tom Brokaw famously called those born around 1917 \u201cthe Greatest Generation.\u201d The epithet for the young men and women who had already come of age by 1917 was less inspirational. \u201cSometimes,\u201d wrote       Walter Lippmann,        one of their number, \u201cI think we are a damned generation.\u201dThis damned generation is the subject of       Jeremy McCarter\u2019s       dazzling and occasionally exasperating \u201cYoung Radicals.\u201d Among other things, Mr. McCarter has been the theater critic for New York magazine and spent five years on the staff of New York\u2019s Public Theater. He co-wrote a best seller with       Lin-Manuel Miranda,        the creator of the musical \u201cHamilton.\u201d It\u2019s not difficult to see why Mr. Miranda would have been attracted to Mr. McCarter as a writing partner. He has a breezy and engaging style. He shifts between the present and the past tense, often inserts himself into the narrative and can be highly colloquial. \u201cAn ideal is a product of our life experiences, our hopes for our futures, the intimacies we develop among those who value the same things we do,\u201d he writes in typical fashion when two of his characters fall out. \u201cUproot a deeply held belief, and you\u2019re likely to take some of the trellis with it.\u201dYet the style serves a purpose. In \u201cYoung Radicals,\u201d it is to convince us that the damned generation in its own way is also one of America\u2019s most important and that it has something to teach us in its painful battles over ideals and ideas.By Jeremy McCarterRandom House, 352 pages, $30By Christoph IrmscherYale, 434 pages, $40Mr. McCarter picks \u201ca constellation\u201d of five radicals \u201cwhose ideals led them to travel a similar trajectory across the sky of their era.\u201d Lippmann would become for half a century arguably America\u2019s most influential journalist. (\u201cLippmann always has his own foreign policy,\u201d President John F. Kennedy wearily noted. \u201cSometimes it coincides with ours.\u201d)       John Reed,        Lippmann\u2019s Harvard classmate, was one of the first on the scene during the Russian Revolution in November 1917 and wrote \u201cTen Days That Shook the World\u201d about the experience.       Alice Paul       was a suffragette whose activism helped women win the vote in 1920 through the 19th Amendment.       Max Eastman       was the editor of the socialist magazine the Masses and at the center of a famous sedition trial.       Randolph Bourne,        who had been left severely disabled by tuberculosis of the spine in childhood, was a prolific critic and essayist who wrote to make the world more hospitable to, as Bourne himself put it, \u201cthe unpresentable and the unemployable, the incompetent and the ugly, the queer and crotchety people who make up so large a proportion of human folk.\u201d In other words, Mr. McCarter adds, \u201cthe people like him.\u201dMuch of the early action in \u201cYoung Radicals\u201d takes place in New York\u2019s Greenwich Village, then not only a center of outr\u00e9 chic but also a cheap part of the city in which to live. Immigrants teemed through New York in the years before World War I. \u201cThe dynamics for a splendid human civilization are all about us,\u201d Lippmann gushed. So too was a certain naivete. When 25,000 silk workers went on strike in Paterson, N.J., what better way to showcase their plight in New York than to ferry some of them across the Hudson River, as Reed did, to re-enact their strike in a new musical pageant at Madison Square Garden? Surely even Mr. Miranda would have struggled to make a hit out of that one.World War I changed the calculation for everyone as ideals slammed into harsh realities. \u201cEverybody has to grow up,\u201d writes Mr. McCarter (characteristically in the present tense). Reed ran toward that reality, embracing the dangers of frontline reportage and, through his growing personal connection with the Bolsheviks in Russia, dabbling in febrile revolutionary politics. Alice Paul ran toward reality too, single-mindedly recognizing that her commitment to women\u2019s suffrage trumped her opposition to America\u2019s entering World War I.Sometimes the clash between reality and ideals brought relationships to an end. \u201cFresh alliances form,\u201d writes Mr. McCarter; \u201cold friendships collapse.\u201d Bourne idolized Lippmann, but the hero worship, and their friendship, ended when Lippmann went to work for the       Wilson       administration. Bourne could never bring himself to denounce Lippmann personally, but his view was clear enough. \u201cOnly in a world where irony was dead,\u201d he wrote sadly, \u201ccould an intellectual class enter war at the head of such illiberal cohorts in the avowed cause of world-liberalism.\u201dMr. McCarter superbly captures the mix of personal affection and catty animosity of his group, but he never loses sight of the fact that they were engaged in a battle of ideas that really mattered. The differences between Bourne and Lippmann, for example, were essentially philosophical. World War I put two visions of America into conflict. Lippmann\u2019s \u201cideal of Americanism\u201d was essentially one of integration\u2014the melting pot\u2014one aimed at creating, as he put it, a \u201cunion of people rather than a congeries of groups.\u201d Bourne, by contrast, saw the United States as a \u201cbeloved community\u201d in which people could still feel an affinity with their racial and cultural backgrounds. Lippmann could support the war because it did not undermine his vision of an integrated America. \u201cBourne doesn\u2019t have that luxury,\u201d writes Mr. McCarter. For how can the United States be \u201cwelcoming to people drawn from Russia and Germany if it\u2019s sending its sons to help Russians kill Germans, or vice versa\u201d?In the contest between the two men, Bourne found support from his Marxist friend Eastman, whose magazine opposed the war. Eastman for Mr. McCarter is a flawed but courageous character. He admits to being \u201cas nervous as a rabbit\u2019s nose\u201d when speaking out against the war, and at one hostile rally the organizers give him \u201ca hat and coat to disguise himself and a loaded revolver for when the disguise fails.\u201d Even when indicted for violating the Espionage Act, he displays a certain sang-froid in the face of prison and a large fine. \u201cSome of us have twenty years,\u201d he quipped, \u201cbut none of us has $10,000.\u201dAs it happens, Eastman is now the subject of a comprehensive biography by       Christoph Irmscher,        a professor at Indiana University. In \u201cMax Eastman: A Life,\u201d Mr. Irmscher uses his subject\u2019s unsorted papers to create a subtle portrait of a disappointed man across the full span of his life. \u201cI am sure I was meant to do something great,\u201d Eastman tearfully told his wife in 1944, \u201cfor that is not only my deepest, but my most present sorrow: I have wasted my talents.\u201dBy that time, he had gone from his position as a leading radical intellectual to a well-paid staff writer for Reader\u2019s Digest and had moved across the spectrum from Marxism to the libertarian right. That Eastman publicly denounced       Stalin       and the purges showed that he had maintained the independence of mind that had carried him through the Masses trials in 1918. Still, Mr. Irmscher writes sympathetically, \u201cas he admitted in a moment of moving candor, it was difficult for a man to say that the cause for which he has given his life has failed.\u201dReaders wanting a full life of Eastman are well served by Mr. Irmscher\u2019s meticulous chronicle, which, in his own words, is \u201ca story largely about sex and communism\u201d\u2014Eastman was passionate not only in his politics but in his many relations with women, which ranged from three tempestuous marriages to attempts to bed almost every glamorous female writer who came across his path. Most readers, however, may be content to see Eastman in the context of the cohort that Mr. McCarter presents.For all the different choices that the young radicals faced, they shared, Mr. McCarter suggests, a sense of unfulfilled mission. Alice Paul turned that sense into a spur to action: After helping secure the 19th Amendment, she never lost her edge and spent the next half-century campaigning for the Equal Rights Amendment, whose first version she helped to draft in 1923. Her long life\u2014she died in 1977 at the age of 92\u2014was in contrast to that of Bourne, who died in 1918, age 32. Among his papers was a manuscript that contained his most enduring phrase: \u201cWar is the health of the state.\u201dReed died two years later, of scrub typhus in the Soviet Union. Like Eastman, he by the end had seen through Soviet communism and was, according to a friend, \u201cdisgusted to the point of despair.\u201d Lippmann emerged from the war and its aftermath as disillusioned in his own way as Eastman and Reed. His excoriating book \u201cPublic Opinion\u201d (1922) was described by       John Dewey       as \u201cperhaps the most effective indictment of democracy as currently conceived ever penned.\u201d Thereafter, as a widely read columnist, Lippmann would tread the fine line between insider and critic in American politics. At his best he was, as Life magazine said in the context of Lippmann\u2019s views of       Lyndon Johnson       and the Vietnam War, \u201cthe embodiment of meaningful opposition.\u201dAt the end of \u201cYoung Radicals,\u201d Mr. McCarter returns again to Randolph Bourne, because \u201cthe core of his vision is that people who come to this country can\u2019t be discriminated against because of who they are or what they believe.\u201d That\u2019s an important principle and one rooted in the Constitution, but Mr. McCarter goes on to discuss writing his epilogue as \u201cI\u2019ve watched thousands of Americans rush to airports to protest a ban on immigrants from majority-Muslim countries.\u201dThis topical digression is a rare misstep for Mr. McCarter, for it politicizes the context of the book, heavy-handedly so, as even he admits when he notes that parts of the epilogue will inevitably seem \u201cfoolish\u201d by the time the book comes out. It may put some readers off, but shouldn\u2019t. \u201cYoung Radicals\u201d is a brilliant, even inspiring book, full of whip-smart analysis that demands to be read and argued over. Mr. McCarter takes a relatively obscure and, in other hands, potentially dry-as-dust topic and renders it fresh and important. It doesn\u2019t need any contemporary spin. Its resonance is unspoken.Each generation faces new opportunities and challenges. Some generations enjoy more of the former; others endure more of the latter. But \u201cdamned\u201d or not, ultimately the only response is simply to keep going.Walter Lippmann understood that better than most. \u201cLippmann had come to think of his generation\u2019s history as a record of democratic defeat, of possibilities foreclosed,\u201d Mr. McCarter writes. \u201cBut Lippmann had made a defiant promise that he would still be fighting long after [others] had quit. . . . He felt a sense of resignation about American prospects . . . but he wrote those columns anyway.\u201d Let\u2019s hope Mr. McCarter keeps writing too.\u2014Mr. Aldous, the       Eugene Meyer       Professor at Bard College, is the author of \u201c      Schlesinger      : The Imperial Historian,\u201d to be published in the fall.", "news_time": "2017-06-23 13:32:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/when-ideals-met-reality-1498239144", "news_title": "When Ideals Met Reality", "keywords": "bookcar0624,book review,recommended books,books,political,general news,society,community,arts,entertainment,reviews"}, {"content": "LONDON\u2014            Glencore        GLNCY 1.02%       PLC said Friday it has submitted a sweetened all-cash offer of $2.68 billion for             Rio Tinto        RIO -0.26%       PLC\u2019s Australian coal assets, days after its previous attempt to scotch an acquisition by a Chinese suitor was rejected.The Anglo-Swiss mining-and-commodities trading giant said its bid for Coal & Allied Industries Ltd., which includes a coal price-linked royalty, is fully funded and is at least $225 million greater than an offer made by             Yancoal Australia Ltd.      , a subsidiary of China\u2019s Yanzhou Coal Mining Co.Anglo-Australian mining company Rio Tinto on Tuesday rebuffed a $2.5 billion offer Glencore made earlier this month, and recommended that shareholders approve Yancoal\u2019s $2.45 billion bid, in part because it expects to complete the deal faster than one with Glencore.Glencore also offered Rio Tinto a $225 million deposit to be forfeited if the transaction were unable to obtain regulatory approval.Rio Tinto said Friday its board will consider Glencore\u2019s proposal and provide an update ahead of its general meeting on Tuesday.Friday\u2019s raised offer from Glencore further demonstrates the renewed appetite for deal-making by Chief Executive       Ivan Glasenberg       almost two years after the Switzerland-based commodity giant experienced a downward spiral in share price.Since the company\u2019s stock recovered, Mr. Glasenberg has engineered the purchase of a stake in Russian state oil company PAO Rosneft, taken full control of a Congolese mine and made an offer to take over agricultural trader             Bunge Ltd.Mr. Glasenberg has long coveted Rio Tinto\u2019s coal assets because they sit near some of Glencore\u2019s Australian coal operations, offering opportunities for cost savings were they to merge.\u201cThe probability of Glencore gaining these assets has increased in our view,\u201d RBC Capital Markets said in a note on Friday.A Glencore takeover of Rio\u2019s coal assets would hand more control to a company that is already one of the biggest coal traders in the world. Rio has touted Yancoal\u2019s approval from regulators in China, a voracious consumer of coal.In its news release announcing its higher offer, Glencore suggested that Rio\u2019s concerns about Chinese regulatory approvals\u2014which Yancoal already has\u2014are overblown. Chinese antitrust regulators have flexed their muscles on mining deals in recent years but Glencore said it is \u201creasonably confident\u201d the Rio assets up for sale represent less than 1% of China\u2019s seaborne imports.\u201cGlencore therefore believes that any concerns regarding Chinese antitrust approval risk are not justifiable,\u201d the company said.Rio Tinto is trying to shed much of its coal operations, especially thermal coal, the type burned to make electricity.The price of thermal coal shot up in 2016 as demand from China heated up. The market has cooled this year, and analysts expect prices to remain subdued as countries switch to cleaner-burning fuels.Glencore, the world\u2019s biggest trader of thermal coal, expects demand for the fossil fuel to remain solid, since it is one of the cheapest fuels for electricity generation.Shares of Glencore were down 0.4% in Friday afternoon trading, while Rio shares were up 1.2%.Write to Tapan Panchal at Tapan.Panchal@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-23 13:20:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/glencore-raises-offer-for-rio-tintos-australian-coal-assets-1498225944", "news_title": "Glencore Raises Offer for Rio Tinto\u2019s Australian Coal Assets", "keywords": "glencore,rio tinto, yancoal,Coal & Allied Industries,Glencore,GLEN.LN,GLEN.U.K.,Rio Tinto,RIO,UK:RIO,Yancoal Australia,YAL.AU,AU:YAL,ownership changes,acquisitions,mergers,divestments,physical asset transactions,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,energy,coal mining,coal mining support activities,metal ore mining,basic materials,resources,mining,quarrying"}, {"content": "BERMUDA\u2014Larry Ellison\u2019s third-consecutive America\u2019s Cup is within reach: All he needs to do is engineer one of the greatest comebacks in sports, version 2.0.Ellison\u2019s             Oracle                   Team USA has lost all four races to rival Emirates Team New Zealand and four more defeats in the races starting this weekend will secure the nearly 166-year old trophy for the Kiwis. New Zealand has outdistanced the U.S. with relative ease in each heat, erasing the one-point advantage Oracle enjoyed entering the finals after beating the Kiwis twice on the way to winning the qualifying series.New Zealand now stands in a familiar position: riding a string of early wins toward an increasingly insurmountable advantage. That\u2019s how the Kiwis began the last Cup finals against the U.S. in 2013, stretching their lead to one race from victory, before Oracle ripped off eight straight wins for an improbable comeback. Many called it the greatest in sports history.Though Oracle has a smaller hole to climb from this time, several sailors said overcoming the speed of New Zealand\u2019s 50-foot catamaran could prove difficult for the U.S.\u2019s engineers and designers. America\u2019s Cup races are often decided by the slimmest of advantages, and the Kiwi\u2019s edge appears more than slim.\u201cExcept for the fact that we all lived through 2013, this would look like a sure thing,\u201d said Peter Isler, a navigator for two Cup-winning teams.Memories of 2013 are still fresh for both teams involved. Back then, Oracle skipper Jimmy Spithill insisted time and again that the U.S. could still win, even as the Kiwi\u2019s wins mounted. Spithill called the team\u2019s 1-8 deficit \u201cmotivating,\u201d Ellison told reporters after the races.The amusement with which sailors greeted Spithill\u2019s expressions of confidence faded as the U.S. crawled back. A requested one-race postponement, along with several weather delays, bought Oracle the time to tweak their boat and sailing style, while adding U.K. sailing hero Ben Ainslie to the racing crew also helped kick-start the team\u2019s recovery. Ellison said the team had finally \u201ccracked the code\u201d to the catamaran.Spithill said that experience proved Oracle was capable of such a comeback and the five-day gap between races off Bermuda offered a lot more time to figure things out. He added that Ellison never lost faith in the crew during the 2013 Cup, and he had no doubt the software tycoon was still confident now.\u201cThis isn\u2019t our first rodeo,\u201d Spithill told reporters after the racing last weekend. \u201cWe\u2019ve been in this position before and we\u2019ve had less time before. So we\u2019ve got five important days and we\u2019ll be using every single hour of them.\u201dA similar comeback will be challenging, some sailors and analysts said. Ainslie departed for his own team, and other squads also poached talent. The Kiwis reorganized after the 2013 defeat, returning with a relatively youthful crew and innovations including stationary bicycles that replace the typical hand-cranked winches used to power the boats\u2019 systems. There\u2019s even an Olympic medal-winning cyclist on the team.In the races, the speed difference has been conspicuous, with the Kiwis winning the most-recent races by gaps of 49 seconds and more than a minute \u2014hundreds of meters for boats that can go highway speeds. Ellison, who has been a visible presence watching races from a chase boat in white team gear, enjoyed the defender\u2019s privilege of crafting the rules for this year\u2019s event, and a sweep would mark a significant blow to a team that entered the finals with what sailors said were many advantages.Peter Burling, New Zealand\u2019s 26-year-old helmsman, told reporters his team knew better than to let up. New Zealand has also already overcome technical challenges in this Cup, such as a prestart crash in a qualifying race against Ainslie\u2019s Land Rover BAR that necessitated rapid repairs. He said the team intended on spending every minute working to maintain its advantage.\u201cWe know if we stand still these guys will be catching us,\u201d Burling said. A victory would delight the hordes of flag-waving New Zealand fans crowding the grandstands, reclaiming the Cup for the first time since 2000 and helping ease the sting of 2013 for a country that prides itself on its sailing prowess.Spithill said he doesn\u2019t think the bikes are key to the Kiwis\u2019 speed, just one of many factors. Much of the design battle has taken place out of sight below the waterline, on the underwater wings known as hydrofoils that lift the vessels from the water so they soar above the waves. Control systems, such as the hydraulics that adjust those foils, are also a major area of development and likely to be areas of pre-race focus, several sailors said.Even with the shore crew working round-the-clock this week, some sailors and experts doubt the U.S. team can pull off another shocking turnaround, noting many of those things are hard to adjust quickly.It\u2019s a \u201cvery different situation this time,\u201d said Ken Read, a television analyst and veteran of many Cup races. \u201cLast time there was heaps of untapped potential. This time, after three years of work and sailing, I think Oracle entered the contest feeling polished with their best foot forward. This will be very interesting. Don\u2019t know what else they have in their toy box.\u201dWrite to Aaron Kuriloff at aaron.kuriloff@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-23 13:15:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/ellisons-oracle-team-needs-epic-americas-cup-comeback-again-1498237697", "news_title": "Ellison\u2019s Oracle Team Needs Epic America\u2019s Cup Comeback...Again", "keywords": "sports,recreation,routine general news"}, {"content": "President       Donald Trump\u2019s       decision to fire FBI Director       James Comey       is increasingly unpopular, a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll has found. At the same time, half of those surveyed said they believe the news media has exaggerated allegations about the president.The poll of 900 adults found that 46% disapproved of Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to fire Mr. Comey on May 9, which came during the FBI\u2019s probe of alleged Russian interference in the 2016 election. Some 38% had disapproved of the firing in mid-May, shortly after it occurred.The poll also found that Mr. Trump\u2019s job approval rating had remained essentially unchanged at 40% despite the growing opposition to the Comey firing, suggesting that the public is not as preoccupied with the controversy as is official Washington.\u201cThe public is not focused on it nearly as much as we may be,\u201d said       Jeff Horwitt,        a Democratic pollster who helped conduct the survey. \u201cBut public opinion is moving away\u201d from Mr. Trump.Mr. Comey testified on Capitol Hill earlier this month that Mr. Trump asked him to ease off an investigation into former national security adviser       Michael Flynn       and sought his personal loyalty, and subsequently fired him in an effort to influence the course of the Russia probe.Mr. Trump initially said he had fired Mr. Comey over his handling of the investigation into       Hillary Clinton\u2019s       emails, later acknowledging \u201cthis Russia thing\u201d had been on his mind when he made the decision. Mr. Trump has denied he pressured Mr. Comey on the Flynn investigation or had asked for his loyalty, and has offered to give his version of events under oath.When poll respondents were asked which man they were more likely to believe, 45% said Mr. Comey, while 22% said Mr. Trump. Some 21% supported neither of them.The poll also found widespread mistrust of the media, as 50% agreed with the statement that news media coverage of recent allegations against Mr. Trump was \u201cirresponsible,\u201d \u201cover-dramatized\u201d and \u201csensationalized.\u201d One-third said the media\u2019s reporting had been \u201cresponsible,\u201c while 12% said the media had been too restrained and should be more aggressive.Despite the criticism of reporting on the president, more than half said they believed the Russian government had interfered with the U.S. election in 2016. Of those, one-third said they believed the interference affected the outcome of the election.The U.S. intelligence community in January determined that Moscow ran a campaign designed to help the Republican president win the presidential election.

The poets would be given a quarter of an hour or so to turn out a serviceable sonnet on a chosen theme. In December 1816       John Keats       and       Leigh Hunt       wrote sonnets on \u201cthe grasshopper and cricket.\u201d Hunt\u2019s effort holds up pretty well, but you\u2019d have to say that Keats won with the poem that begins \u201cThe poetry of earth is never dead\u201d and ends \u201con a lone winter evening,\u201d when \u201cto one in drowsiness half lost\u201d the cricket \u201cshrills\u201d and wakens an echo of the grasshopper\u2019s summer song \u201camong some grassy hills.\u201dIn 1817 Percy Bysshe Shelley wrote \u201cOzymandias,\u201d perhaps the greatest of his short poems, when he and his banker friend       Horace Smith       sat down to compose dueling sonnets on a passage from the Greek historian Diodorus Siculus. The passage concerned Ramesses II, the Egyptian pharaoh who squared off against Moses in Exodus. A massive statue glorifying him proclaimed on its pedestal that he was the \u201cking of kings.\u201d The poets used this phrase and called the ancient pharaoh, whose statue lay in ruins, Ozymandias.Horace Smith\u2019s \u201cOzymandias\u201d has some fine lines about a hunter in a future age beholding \u201csome fragment huge\u201d in the wilderness \u201cwhere London once stood.\u201d But genius went into Shelley\u2019s poem:I met a traveller from an antique landWho said: \u201cTwo vast and trunkless legs of stoneStand in the desert... Near them, on the sand,Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,Tell that its sculptor well those passions readWhich yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,The hand that mocked them and the heart that fed:And on the pedestal these words appear:\u2018My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!\u2019Nothing beside remains. Round the decayOf that colossal wreck, boundless and bareThe lone and level sands stretch far away.\u201dOne reason \u201cOzymandias\u201d is so often anthologized is that it conveys a message dear to poets. Time mocks emperors, particularly boastful ones. The sculptor\u2019s \u201chand that mocked\u201d is a brilliant pun, for the word \u201cmocked\u201d in 1817 signified not only ridicule but also imitation, as in painting from a model.Fragments fascinate us, because they bear witness to the devastation of time.       Shakespeare\u2019s       Sonnet 55 argues in favor of poetry, which shall outlive \u201cthe gilded monuments / Of princes,\u201d because marble and stone are inevitably \u201cbesmear\u2019d with sluttish time,\u201d while language, being immaterial, can theoretically live forever. In \u201cOzymandias,\u201d Shelley, the brash idealist, argues against tyranny itself\u2014\u201cthe [ruler\u2019s] frown, / And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command\u201d\u2014in the course of presenting the evidence that time defeats despots with their monumental vanity.An unusual rhyme scheme, with two rhymes occurring three times each, contributes to the power of \u201cOzymandias.\u201d But the magnificence of the poem\u2019s conclusion goes beyond rhetoric. The disjunction between \u201cLook on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!\u201d and the curt sentence that follows, \u201cNothing beside remains,\u201d is a breathtaking example of how a poet can use the line-break as a meaning-making mechanism.The phrase \u201ccolossal wreck,\u201d a near oxymoron, is as landlocked in the poem\u2019s last three lines as the ruined statue in the endless desert. The alliteration\u2014\u201cboundless and bare / The lone and level sands stretch far away\u201d\u2014smoothly conveys a sense of the vast continuous distance covered in that \u201cstretch.\u201d The image is haunting, as is the framing device that Shelley employs. We are left wondering about the mysterious \u201ctraveller from an antique land\u201d who is said to be the author of the poem.\u201cThe New Colossus\u201d (1883),       Emma Lazarus\u2019s       stirring sonnet about the Statue of Liberty, borrows a rhyme from \u201cOzymandias\u201d (stand, land, command) and invites us to read it as a rejoinder to Shelley\u2019s sonnet. The statue in Lazarus\u2019s poem is a replacement for the Colossus of Rhodes, \u201cthe brazen giant of Greek fame.\u201d The great bronze monument to the sun god, one of the Seven Wonders of the World, stood in the harbor of Rhodes. (It crumbled in an earthquake in 226 B.C.) Not as a warrior with \u201cconquering limbs\u201d but as a woman with \u201cmild eyes\u201d and \u201csilent lips,\u201d the new colossus will stand as tall as the old, honoring not a god but an ideal that will make it a wonder of the modern world. The legend in Lazarus\u2019s poem could be construed as the opposite of a tyrant\u2019s imperial vanity:\u201cKeep, ancient lands, your storied pomp!\u201d cries she,With silent lips. \u201cGive me your tired, your poor,Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me,I lift my lamp beside the golden door!\u201d\u2014Mr. Lehman\u2019s latest book is \u201cPoems in the Manner Of\u201d (Scribner) comprising imitations, approximations and translations of poets from Catullus and Li Po to the present.

Other topics, like the EU\u2019s demands that Britain pay a divorce bill of upwards of \u20ac60 billion ($67 billion) to settle its past spending pledges, are expected to be far thornier.However, European Council President       Donald Tusk       made it clear\u00a0Friday\u00a0that tough negotiations lay ahead on citizens\u2019 rights.\u201cMy first impression is that the U.K.\u2019s offer is below our expectations and that it risks worsening the situation of citizens. But it will be for our negotiating team to analyze the offer line by line, once we receive it on paper,\u201d Mr. Tusk told reporters at the end of a summit of EU leaders here.German Chancellor       Angela Merkel       said Mrs. May\u2019s offer was \u201ca good start but certainly no breakthrough.\u201dShe said it appeared clear from the offer that Britain would no longer allow EU citizens freedom of movement after the U.K. leaves the bloc. Freedom to live and work in other countries is one of the four basic principles underpinning relations among EU states, alongside others guaranteeing the free movement of capital, goods and many services.\u201cThe central point is that if there is no guarantee for the four freedoms, then this has to have effects on the future relationship of the U.K. with the 27 EU states,\u201d the German chancellor said.Prime Minister       Beata Szydlo       of Poland, which has more citizens in the U.K. than any other EU country, called Mrs. May\u2019s offer \u201ca good proposal\u201d but said the EU side would await the details.During a dinner in Brussels\u00a0on Thursday\u00a0evening, Mrs. May outlined to her EU counterparts a proposal that would offer millions of EU citizens currently in Britain a pathway to apply for permanent residency.She said EU citizens who arrived in Britain before a yet-to-be-determined date\u2014likely before Britain leaves the bloc in March 2019\u2014and have been in the U.K. for five years could apply to stay indefinitely and would receive many of the same rights and benefits as British citizens. Those who have stayed for fewer years would eventually be able to apply for that status.The EU has already laid out its proposal for handling the issue, effectively demanding that EU citizens already in Britain or arriving there in coming years enjoy the same rights they hold at present.Mrs. May promised\u00a0Friday\u00a0afternoon to lay out full details of her plan\u00a0on Monday. She acknowledged \u201csome differences\u201d between the British and EU positions.\u201cI want all those EU citizens who are in the U.K., who have made their lives and homes in our country, to know that no one will have to leave,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is a fair and serious offer.\u201dAmong the issues still to be resolved are the residency rights and benefits of non-EU nationals married to EU citizens in Britain, the cut-off date after which EU citizens would no longer be able to seek permanent residency, and whose courts would oversee the agreement.\u2018I can\u2019t see the European Court of Justice being excluded from the settlement in the future, but that\u2019s a matter for the negotiations to resolve.\u2019Mrs. May said her proposals, if agreed upon, would be enshrined into U.K. law. She said if the proposals are included in Britain\u2019s withdrawal agreement on leaving the EU, they should also be enshrined in international law, raising the possibility that the U.K. would seek some kind of international arbitration panel to adjudicate disputes between the two sides post-Brexit. Mrs. May has said she doesn\u2019t want EU courts adjudicating British law after Brexit.That is a position the EU side has rejected.\u201cI can\u2019t see the European Court of Justice being excluded from the settlement in the future, but that\u2019s a matter for the negotiations to resolve,\u201d European Commission President       Jean-Claude Juncker       said\u00a0Friday\u00a0after the summit.On Monday, the EU and the U.K. started face-to-face negotiations over Britain\u2019s decision to withdraw from the bloc. Mrs. May\u2019s government has gone into the talks facing major political challenges at home after her Conservative party lost its majority in recent elections.The EU has set out three issues on which it wants to make progress in the Brexit negotiations before the bloc turns to Britain\u2019s priority: a broad trade and security agreement to bolster post-Brexit economic ties between the two sides.The three issues are citizens\u2019 rights, the divorce bill and avoiding a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The EU wants to wrap up talks by October 2018 to give both sides six months to ratify a deal in time for Britain to leave the bloc at the end of\u00a0March 2019.\u2014Valentina Pop and Julian E.

Ted Hinton had a unique perspective on       Clyde Barrow       and       Bonnie Parker      : He knew them, and he killed them. His story begins in 1932, when he became a sheriff\u2019s deputy in Dallas County, where he witnessed Clyde\u2019s early days as a car thief and Bonnie\u2019s as a waitress. In time, as their fame and audacity grew, he joined       Frank Hamer,        the legendary Texas Ranger given a special commission to stop them. Hinton details how Hamer maneuvered to create a posse of six men who, after hard weeks on the hunt, ambushed the couple near their hideout. Approximately 150 rounds were fired into their stolen Ford. At the autopsy, the coroner would find 17 holes in Clyde and 26 in Bonnie. The car itself looked like a lace doily. What makes \u201cAmbush\u201d remarkable is its evocation of the outlaws\u2019 final moments as the shower of lead poured in on them: \u201cFor a fleeting instant, the car seems to melt and hang in a kind of eerie and animated suspension, trying to move forward, spitting gravel at the wheels but unable to break through the shield of withering fire.\u201d I don\u2019t know if Hinton himself composed the passage\u2014he was the Browning automatic rifleman on the death squad\u2014or whether it\u2019s an invention of \u201cas told to\u201d assistant Larry Grove, but it\u2019s a piece of found poetry whose power no other chronicle of Bonnie and Clyde has ever achieved.By Bryan Burrough (2004)2. The subtitle of the book is apt: \u201cAmerica\u2019s Greatest Crime Wave and the Birth of the FBI, 1933-34.\u201d That suggests its agenda\u2014the argument that       J. Edgar Hoover       exploited the threat of a great crime wave in order to nourish the growth of his nascent organization. Perhaps, but Hoover\u2019s options were slim. Thanks to their audacity, bank robbers had become a national phenomenon, and had Hoover not gone full-bore after them, his \u201cDivision\u201d (as it was called in 1934) would have had to struggle for acceptance. Still, Mr. Burrough\u2019s account is superb as it details the evolution of the modern FBI from the \u201cKansas City Massacre\u201d of 1933, in which four law-enforcement officers were machine-gunned to death, down to the capture of the last of the big-time bad guys,       Alvin Karpis,        three years later. It\u2019s a history of the battles of Hoover and       Melvin Purvis       of the FBI versus all of the motorized bandits of 1933-34, including Bonnie and Clyde, the Barker-Karpis Gang,       John Dillinger,        Charles \u201cPretty Boy\u201d Floyd, George \u201cMachine Gun\u201d Kelly and the very dangerous Lester \u201cBaby Face Nelson\u201d Gillis. Mr. Burrough\u2019s sources reportedly included several hundred thousand newly released FBI files\u2014a formidable treasure trove.By       Steven Nickel        &       William J. Helmer       (2002)3. Steven Nickel and William J. Helmer get Lester \u201cBaby Face Nelson\u201d Gillis in a way few others have. He was far from stupid, he hated his nickname and unlike others of his ilk he had vision, a cunning tactical mind and\u2014astonishingly\u2014a yearning for the Ozzie and Harriet life with his beloved wife, Helen, and his two kids, Ronald and Darlene. He was clearly the most dangerous of gangsters\u2014at one bank job, he machine-gunned the downtown of South Bend, Ind. The authors recount in detail each of the major bank robberies in which Gillis took part, including the fiasco at the Little Bohemia vacation lodge in northern Wisconsin, when all the robbers escaped an FBI trap, while the agents lost a man and also killed a civilian. An entire chapter is devoted to Gillis\u2019s final gunfight on Nov. 27, 1934, with the two FBI agents who killed him, even as he was killing them.By       John Toland       (1963)4. John Toland\u2019s book could be mistaken for a relic from another age, given its nuance-free admiration of J. Edgar Hoover. It\u2019s not hard to fathom the reason: Its author published this work at the height of the FBI\u2019s glory and reputation. \u201cThe Dillinger Days\u201d offers a portrait of the bureau as it wanted to be seen. It\u2019s a polished, eminently readable history but a kind in which questions go unasked. Toland never wonders, for instance, why the eager FBI took Dillinger in a crowd outside Chicago\u2019s Biograph Theater instead of waiting till he walked three blocks to his deserted rooming house. Two bystanders were wounded as the agents shot their target down. The lawmen were extraordinarily lucky not to have a friendly-fire massacre of moviegoers on their hands. But that was 1934 through the lens of 1963.By       Michael Wallis       (1992)5. Otherwise superb, \u201cPretty Boy\u201d does suffer from one major blind spot, and that is the author\u2019s evident inability to overcome his affection for his subject. His failure to bring himself to pass anything resembling a harsh judgment on Floyd is especially obvious in the book\u2019s strange account of the Kansas City Massacre, an orgy of cop-murder. Mr. Wallis merely offers the theory that Floyd would have been incapable of the sort of wanton murder that took place. Still, his book is splendid as a way in to a view of the whole era. And it\u2019s a rich one, a superb picture of a land racked by depression, poverty, ecological catastrophe and a hunger for heroes. Though Oklahoma proper, which spawned and shaped Floyd, a farm boy from the Cookson Hills, is the nominal topic, it\u2019s really America at large he\u2019s writing about.", "news_time": "2017-06-23 12:51:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/stephen-hunter-1498236716", "news_title": "Stephen Hunter", "keywords": "bookcar0624,book review,books,arts,entertainment,reviews"}, {"content": "\u2018She always played a tart.\u201d That\u2019s one fan\u2019s not unappreciative summary of the movie career of       Gloria Grahame       (1923-1981): the blonde with gray-green eyes who worked for top-drawer directors from       Frank Capra       to       Fritz Lang       to       Elia Kazan      ; co-starred with       Katharine Hepburn,       James Stewart       and       Frank Sinatra      ; and was nominated for two Academy Awards (winning one, for 1952\u2019s \u201cThe Bad and the Beautiful\u201d).

Mr. Turner was just starting his career. She was 20 years older than he, but the age difference didn\u2019t matter to either lover. With Grahame, Mr. Turner traveled to Las Vegas (where she told him, \u201cI don\u2019t wanna get wrapped up with any gangsters. . . . I met one once who gave me diamonds but I sent them back. I didn\u2019t wanna end up in the East River\u201d) and to Los Angeles, where they drove past Gloria\u2019s old Brentwood home, where she had lived with her third husband, writer-producer       Cy Howard.       (Before Howard she had been married to film director       Nicholas Ray.       Later she would marry her former stepson,       Tony Ray.       She had children by both Rays. \u201cIt was a family of complicated relationships,\u201d Mr. Turner writes.)At her suggestion, Mr. Turner moved with Grahame to New York, where the couple had more good times\u2014until, as he writes, \u201cone day everything turned strange.\u201d His lover became moody, solitary, uncommunicative: \u201cI assumed that she didn\u2019t want to bother with our friendship any more.\u201d He returned to England, believing that their relationship was over.Then, in late 1981, while staying at his parents\u2019 house in Liverpool, he received a call from Grahame, who was in the not-so-near town of Lancaster, booked to do a play but now grievously ill. Refusing a doctor\u2019s care, let alone hospitalization, Grahame moved into her ex-lover\u2019s family home.The story of her sojourn there takes up the majority of Mr. Turner\u2019s affecting chronicle, a flashback-filled text that evokes by turns the feel of a documentary film, a subtle poem, a melancholy novella and a farcical play featuring an \u201cunlikely collection of people: a dying film star, her son who was also her brother-in-law, a doctor who was unable to do anything to help,\u201d and other eccentric supporting characters. Mr. Turner\u2019s unpredictable approach, full of oblique angles and unexpected shifts, seems to emulate some acting advice Grahame told him she got from her one-time co-star Bogart. \u201cHe taught me little tricks,\u201d she told Mr. Turner. \u201c \u2018Just keep it in the shadows, Gloria,\u2019 he used to say. \u2018Let the camera come to you.\u2019 I liked him.\u201d\u2014Mr. Nolan is co-editor (with       Suzanne Marrs      ) of \u201cMeanwhile There Are Letters: The Correspondence of       Eudora Welty       and       Ross Macdonald.      \u201d", "news_time": "2017-06-23 12:50:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/gloria-days-1498236615", "news_title": "Gloria Days", "keywords": "bookcar0624,book review,recommended books,books,political,general news,celebrities,arts,entertainment,living,lifestyle,reviews"}, {"content": "Chinook, sockeye, coho, chum, humpback, steelhead\u2014they sound like a lineup of heavy metal bands, but these are all species of the Pacific salmon genus Oncorhynchus, a charismatic tribe of silvery migrants once so prolific that they were used for fertilizer and dog food but are now, in places, so embattled that some fragile populations face extinction. In the words of       Langdon Cook,        author of this invigorating book, \u201cThey\u2019re dissolving into fable.\u201dAt the heart of \u201cUpstream\u201d is a journey\u2014the oldest shape in literature. It follows the precarious odyssey of these fish that are born in freshwater streams, swim down to feed and mature in the ocean, then run up again to spawn just once, and die. This is known as anadromy (eels, which do the reverse, are catadromous), and salmon\u2019s dramatic life story has captivated the imagination of many peoples in the Northern Hemisphere, eliciting wonder at the salmon\u2019s powers of endurance and giving rise to fluvial myths and seasonal ceremonies that persist even though the heyday of great abundance is largely gone.In tracing the history and life cycle of these iconic creatures, Mr. Cook embarks on a series of his own journeys\u201414 nicely episodic chapters that explore how and where such fish still survive in the modern world, despite the threats of logging, dams, the diversion of running water for domestic and commercial uses, overfishing, and climate change. It is a saga that has been told before but seldom with such immediacy and panache.By Langdon CookBallantine, 314 pages, $27\u201cUpstream\u201d covers a lot of ground. We begin in a high-end Seattle restaurant, where the season\u2019s first, greatly prized king salmon are being prepared for table. They hail from Alaska\u2019s Copper River, where the annual catch is carefully monitored, but elsewhere the situation is becoming dire. Along the Columbia River in Washington, \u201charnessed for power\u201d by the Grand Coulee Dam, 1,200 miles of spawning grounds were closed off and a 10,000-year-old tribal havesting spot obliterated back in 1957. Today the salmon runs on the Columbia are augmented by hatchery fish, pale imitations (\u201can illusion that everything is okay,\u201d in Mr. Cook\u2019s words), but if you want the real thing, you will have to buy it beneath the Bridge of the Gods, from Native American netsmen who are the only people licensed to catch wild chinook there\u2014a source of continuing controversy.As he visits other waterways that have similarly become part of engineered landscapes\u2014the Golden State\u2019s Sacramento River is \u201con life support,\u201d the Snake River in Oregon and Idaho has been \u201chandcuffed\u201d by dams and is thronged with newly prolific predators\u2014the author encounters a spirited cast of characters that includes foodies, eco-warriors, sport anglers, local bureaucrats and zealots of every stripe, all of them passionate and often at loggerheads with one another over the use of fresh water, the lifeblood of every region. From the remote gill-netting community of Cordova, Alaska, to British Columbia\u2019s fabled Kispiox River, \u201cUpstream\u201d charts numerous conflicting attitudes toward the sharing of natural resources.Even the existence of hatcheries is contentious. In a lively chapter titled \u201cThe Ballad of Lonesome Larry,\u201d Mr. Cook describes the painstaking efforts of scientists at Idaho\u2019s Eagle Fish Hatchery to sustain a sockeye run that has to migrate 900 freshwater miles and surmount eight hydroelectric dams. This certainly appears a heroic undertaking by all concerned, but some purists regard reared salmon as \u201czombies\u201d and \u201cclones\u201d that merely dilute the gene pool when funds would be better applied to habitat preservation in the \u201cstrongholds\u201d where wild populations are hanging on. There seems to be precious little agreement.Throughout these sorties, Mr. Cook is a congenial and intrepid companion, happily hiking into hinterlands and snorkeling in headwaters. Along the way we learn about filleting techniques, native cooking methods and self-pollinating almond trees, and his continual curiosity ensures that the narrative unfurls gradually, like a long spey cast. One arresting example is his description of the reef-netters on Lummi Island, in the Puget Sound. Here entrepreneur       Riley Starks       has revived a traditional practice of luring sockeye salmon down an avenue of ropes and colored ribbons to the waiting net, where they are individually handled, thus avoiding any wasteful bycatch. The fish taste better, too, because they are \u201cuntainted by a stressful death,\u201d whereas salmon caught with gill nets \u201cmight spend hours, or maybe even an entire night . . . hanging dead in the net.\u201d There are now fewer than 100 reef-netters working anywhere, none of them Indian. \u201cUpstream\u201d may bristle with fins, but the human factor is a crucial aspect of each journey.As well as being a gastronome and a naturalist, Mr. Cook is a passionate angler. Homo piscatorius tends to see the aquatic world with a sportsman\u2019s peculiar intensity, and he is good on the beauty and \u201cotherness\u201d of his elusive quarry. On Washington State\u2019s Drano Lake, he drags plug baits and cranks in a hatchery-bred 12-pounder; from a secret \u201choney-hole\u201d in Oregon, he lands a fine 20-pound king salmon with guide extraordinaire       Guido Rahr.       In the penultimate chapter (\u201cHerding the Pinks\u201d), he joins a flotilla of die-hard aficionados on Labor Day fishing Seattle\u2019s industrialized Duwamish River in pursuit of the often despised little \u201chumpies,\u201d or pink salmon, despite the trash compactors and barge traffic. (This type of urban angling is becoming a global cult: In April, I was fly-casting to catfish just upstream of the Ponte Vecchio in downtown Florence.) The chapter ends with a kid triumphantly yelling, \u201cI\u2019ve got one\u201d\u2014a phrase, as Mr. Cook says, \u201cas old as language itself.\u201dWith a pedigree that includes Mark Kurlansky,       John McPhee       and       Roderick Haig-Brown,        Mr. Cook\u2019s style is suitably fluent, an occasional phrase flashing like a flank in the current. One stream is described as sauntering languidly, like \u201can elderly fl\u00e2neur out for a morning constitutional\u201d; a spawning king has \u201cpectoral fins working like frayed Chinese fans.\u201d For all its rehearsal of the perils and vicissitudes facing Pacific salmon, \u201cUpstream\u201d remains a celebration. Given half a chance, nature is resilient, like a thistle muscling up through tarmac. This is not a work of eco-worship, but early on in his book Mr. Cook observes, \u201cOur planet, the only one known to have life on it, is nothing short of a miracle.\u201d Could we please have that entered in the minutes?\u2014Mr. Profumo is the fishing correspondent for Country Life magazine in the U.K.", "news_time": "2017-06-23 12:48:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/rivers-that-flow-with-silver-1498236490", "news_title": "Rivers That Flow With Silver", "keywords": "bookcar0624,book review,recommended books,books,political,general news,arts,entertainment,reviews"}, {"content": "In 2008 the experimental psychologist       Charles Spence       traveled from his home university, Oxford, to Harvard to accept an Ig Nobel Prize for his research on the \u201csonic chip:\u201d a Pringles potato chip, that is, not a computer chip. A snort of laughter might seem the appropriate response to his finding that the higher the frequency of the crunch, the fresher and tastier the chip was perceived to be, making his paper just the thing for this annual, only partially tongue-in-cheek parody of the Nobel Awards. It was more than a joke, however. As the organizers explain, trivial-sounding work can have important implications. What more so than understanding how we experience food?Mr. Spence calls the growing body of knowledge about the experience of food \u201cgastrophysics,\u201d perhaps not the best choice of term since it\u2019s being created not by physicists but by neurologists, psychologists, marketers, designers, behavioral economists and chefs. Mr. Spence gives particular credit to chefs often labeled molecular gastronomers, including such luminaries as       Ferran Adri\u00e0       in Spain,       Ren\u00e9 Redzepi       in Denmark and       Heston Blumenthal       (who wrote the foreword to \u201cGastrophysics\u201d) in England. An enthusiastic participant in their efforts to upend diners\u2019 expectations by changing the sensory environment, Mr. Spence reminisces about the sensation of cutlery handles covered in fur, the titillation of a dish simply described as \u201cBalls\u201d and the rush of emotion as a waitress with a seductive French accent spooned lime gel\u00e9e into his open mouth.The central insight of gastrophysics is that the mind, not the mouth, creates taste and flavor by integrating information from all the senses\u2014sight, sound, touch and smell, as well as taste. This makes taste much more complex than the old picture of the tongue picking up salt, sweet, bitter and sour, as well as perhaps umami and fat\u2014so complex, in fact, that Mr. Spence suggests that taste and flavor need a new name. He throws out \u201cflave\u201d as a possibility, only to let the suggestion drop.By Charles SpenceViking, 308 pages, $27A chatty whirl through the latest discoveries and their real-world applications, roughly organized by the five senses and different dining situations, Mr. Spence\u2019s book is far from a systematic treatise on gastrophysics. Tidbits of information come one after another. Watching food porn on the Food Network so exhausts viewers\u2019 mental reserves, by causing their minds to imagine delicious tastes, that afterward they impulsively buy junk food instead of healthier fare such as bananas. Supermarket managers can induce shoppers to pick up German wine by playing Bierkeller music or French wine by shifting to accordion melodies. On airlines, 27% of the requests for beverages are for tomato juice, a far higher percentage than on the ground. It turns out that loud ambient noise reduces the sensation of salt, sour and bitter tastes while the umami jolt of tomato juice remains unchanged.Although engaging at first, Mr. Spence\u2019s exposition can detract from his goal of showing that gastrophysics is cutting-edge inquiry. Tips for eating less by using smaller plates and drinking water before meals, which have been long familiar to every dieter, diminish the more substantive discoveries. And tales of the hijinks in expensive restaurants suggest that, while gastrotourism may be as demanding a diversion as competitive bird watching or running marathons on five continents in as many days, the pursuit of knowledge is not always uppermost in the minds of diners and chefs.In fact, Mr. Spence\u2019s project is much more consequential than his style might suggest, being part of a growing reaction against the contemporary food ethos, which has been dominated for the past half-century by a yearning for an Arcadian past. Not for him fresh baby salad greens in faux-rustic restaurants, peasant cuisines lovingly detailed by cookbook authors and jeremiads against modern industrialized food for causing disasters ranging from obesity to environmental degradation. Modern food is what Mr. Spence celebrates, looking to the Italian Futurist poet and writer       Filippo Tommaso Marinetti       as its prophet.Down with pasta, thundered Marinetti in his 1930 \u201cManifesto of Futurist Cuisine.\u201d Traditional it might be, he wrote, but it deprived Italians of fire and passion. In with the modern. Dare to eat without cutlery. Don pajamas covered with cork, felt or sandpaper to add new tactile dimensions to dining. Eat in the mock-up of an airplane, complete with roar and juddering. Challenge the taste buds by bathing bowls of fruit in milk in a ghostly green light, nibbling on deep fried full-blown roses, or biting into caramel balls with random fillings of raw meat, garlic or dried fruits. Out with saucepans and spoons; in with autoclaves, ozonizers and ultraviolet-ray generators.Mr. Spence loves the Futurists\u2019 challenge, unbothered by their leaning to militaristic nationalism and fascism, which he never mentions. \u201cFor anyone interested in disruptive multisensory design,\u201d he suggests, \u201ca quick look back at the Futurists is perhaps the best place to start.\u201d High-end chefs, he says, are finally stepping up, the only difference being that they want to make food that tastes good.While most contemporary food writers shun any association with food corporations, and while even star chefs advertise the local ingredients they gather rather than the techniques they adopt from industry, Mr. Spence trumpets his association with multinational food companies such as Unilever, seeing his job as translating research into practical applications. He admires the way Pizza Hut U.K. was able to up spending per customer by about 20% by analyzing big data. Instead of lecturing consumers about diets and labeling, he is in favor of using little tricks of the mind. If describing food as low in fat, sugar or salt, for example, turns consumers away, he endorses the way food manufacturers are creating \u201chealth by stealth,\u201d by cutting these components on the quiet. In short, Mr. Spence\u2019s vision is of a bright new world where delicious, healthful food is the norm, thanks to our understanding how our minds shape flavor. Two millennia ago, the Roman poet Horace said that \u201cthe chief pleasure in eating consists not in costly seasoning or exquisite flavor but in yourself.\u201d As knowledge about the workings of our inner selves grows by leaps and bounds, just wait for the debates about how it should be used.\u2014Ms. Laudan is the author of \u201cCuisine and Empire: Cooking in World History.\u201dAppeared in the June 24, 2017, print edition as 'Drink To Me Only With Thine Eyes.'", "news_time": "2017-06-23 12:46:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/drink-to-me-only-with-thine-eyes-1498236405", "news_title": "Drink to Me Only With Thine Eyes ", "keywords": "bookcar0624,book review,books,political,general news,arts,entertainment,living,lifestyle,reviews"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014President       Donald Trump       on Friday signed into law a measure that gives the secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs more power to fire or punish bad employees at the department while expanding protections for those who point out wrongdoing.The VA Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act passed both houses of Congress with overwhelming support and praise from top veterans advocacy groups.\u201cOur veterans have fulfilled their duty to this nation, and now we must fulfill our duty to them,\u201d Mr. Trump said at an event in the East Room of the White House. \u201cVA accountability is essential to making sure veterans are treated with the respect they have so richly earned.\u201dThe law is designed to fill a gap in Secretary       David Shulkin\u2019s       authority, allowing him to quickly dismiss underperforming employees, something his immediate predecessor, Robert McDonald, said was missing from his authority as head of the department. It creates a presidentially appointed assistant secretary to review allegations of poor performance by employees at the department and to ensure whistleblowers aren\u2019t subject to retaliation.A 2014 scandal in which VA employees were found to have tampered with official records to make patient wait times appear shorter led then-Secretary       Eric Shinseki       and other top officials to resign. Soon after, Congress passed a multibillion-dollar emergency funding bill that aimed to provide expanded care in the private sector.Mr. McDonald drew congressional criticism for not moving fast enough to fire bad employees in the wake of the scandal, while he complained lawmakers hadn\u2019t given him ample authority.The accountability measure signed by Mr. Trump on Friday is designed to cut through that time-consuming process.Mr. Shulkin, who spoke Friday in his fourth high-profile event at the White House since he was confirmed in February, said, \u201cVeterans deserve an organization that they can trust, that provides the highest quality services.\u201dWhen the VA is forced to take back employees who \u201chave deviated\u201d from the agency\u2019s values, he said, \u201cthere\u2019s nothing more demoralizing.\u201dSgt. Michael Verardo, who lost a leg and an arm in Afghanistan in 2010, addressed the delays he experienced as he sought care for his injuries. Sgt. Verdaro also joined Mr. Trump when he signed an executive order at the VA in April.During his speech, Mr. Trump congratulated Sgt. Verdaro and moments later paused to invite him on stage to shake hands.\u201cHe gets up better than I do,\u201d the president quipped.Several lawmakers attended the bill signing, including Republican Sens. Tom Cotton and John Boozman of Arkansas and Dan Sullivan of Alaska.Some veterans\u2019 advocacy groups cheered the legislation.\u201cUntil today, the VA Secretary has not has the necessary authority to discipline or fire bad department employees quickly,\u201d said Mark Lucas, executive director of Concerned Veterans for America, an outspoken veteran advocacy group that has pushed for widespread change at the department, including more reliance on private-sector health care.During the campaign, Mr. Trump had pledged to champion veterans as president and said he would take steps to improve the VA. However, a hiring freeze ordered by the president on his first day in office helped push the backlog of veterans\u2019 claims over the 100,000 mark earlier this year and inordinately affected veterans. The freeze has since been lifted.The new law, which passed with bipartisan support, is seen by lawmakers and veterans advocates as a feather in the cap for Mr. Shulkin.It comes just before Mr. Shulkin has said he would release the text of the next big piece of VA legislation, a replacement to the multibillion-dollar 2014 legislation aimed in large part to expand the availability of private-sector care for veterans.

Pilate\u2019s query made a big impression on me as a child. It stuck in my head, like a mind-worm. Why didn\u2019t Jesus reply? What would a good answer be?The word \u201ctruth\u201d is used in many ways. In \u201cThrough the Looking Glass,\u201d       Lewis Carroll       nailed the way words can lose their meaning in a famous exchange between Humpty Dumpty and Alice. \u201cWhen I use a word,\u201d Humpty Dumpty says scornfully, \u201cit means just what I choose it to mean\u2014neither more nor less.\u201d Levelheaded Alice responds, \u201cThe question is whether you can make words mean so many different things.\u201d Humpty Dumpty comes back with, \u201cThe question is which is to be master\u2014that\u2019s all.\u201dIn science, the meaning of \u201ctruth\u201d is more substantial, and less susceptible to cynical manipulation.Empirical facts\u2014that is, experienced events\u2014are the gold standard of truth. They are what people usually have in mind when they speak of \u201ctruth\u201d or \u201creality.\u201d Science builds on experience, using logic\u2014and a little more.Argument and mathematical deduction play important roles in that process, but they aren\u2019t enough. To do science, we must make assumptions. Early on, people learned the benefits of assuming, as working hypotheses, the stability of physical laws and the irrelevance of faraway events.Those presumptions weren\u2019t obvious, let alone logically necessary. Indeed, notions that contradict them, including creation myths, miracles and astrology, were\u2014and still are\u2014quite popular. But the brilliant success of classical physics, epitomized in Newton\u2019s laws of motion and gravity, has earned those basic assumptions great authority.As science progresses, the most successful \u201cworking hypotheses\u201d evolve into authoritative assumptions\u2014also known as fundamental laws. Scientists often say, \u201cYesterday\u2019s sensation is today\u2019s calibration\u201d\u2014a sort of trail guide for our scientific adventure. Yet a hallmark of science is that we spell out and continually check our assumptions\u2014and, if necessary, modify them. That discipline keeps science honest, reliable and on-track. Yesterday\u2019s theory is tomorrow\u2019s query.Recently, some scientists have started talking about a conception of \u201cpost-empirical\u201d scientific truth\u2014the idea that we can validate scientific ideas by their logical coherence and mathematical elegance, even if they can\u2019t be checked against experience. That\u2019s a bad idea, for several reasons.For one thing, it promotes complacency. Why do the hard work of trying to test your ideas\u2014and maybe discovering that they\u2019re wrong\u2014if you \u201cknow\u201d that they\u2019re \u201ctrue\u201d from the warm feelings they give you?Also, we\u2019ve been there before. Impressed by the beauty and success of Euclidean geometry, philosophers\u2014most notably       Immanuel Kant      \u2014tried to elevate its assumptions to the status of metaphysical Truth. Geometry that fails to follow Euclid\u2019s assumptions is, according to Kant, literally inconceivable. But creative mathematicians, undaunted, played with different assumptions\u2014and their work paid major dividends for physics. Non-Euclidean geometry is central to Einstein\u2019s brilliantly successful theory of gravity, the general theory of relativity.Finally, science plays a vital role in defining the boundaries of rational discourse. \u201cTruth,\u201d in the context of morality, law and politics, is a very different concept from logical or scientific truth. In those domains, science, with its cautious attitude, can\u2019t provide all the answers. Different groups of people make different assumptions, which will sometimes lead to very different conclusions. But when any version of \u201ctruth\u201d contradicts scientific truth (let alone empirical truth), sensible people must reject it. That special authority of scientific truth depends upon its integrity, which talk of \u201cpost-empirical science\u201d undermines.So: What is truth? It is different things, in different contexts. Is it dead? Capital-T \u201cTruth,\u201d the dream of theologians and metaphysicians, remains a troublesome zombie.

The average sale price also came in the highest on record at $406,400. Home prices for new homes have climbed steeply since dipping during the recession.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be very hard to sustain price increases of any large amount going forward because they are pushing against people\u2019s ability to afford homes,\u201d said Brad Hunter, chief economist at HomeAdvisor.Several factors are converging to help strengthen buyer demand. The national unemployment rate in May was 4.3%, a 16-year low, and the economy continued to expand and add jobs in the first half of 2017.Still, the slow pace of new construction is constraining supply. Housing starts declined for the third straight month in May, as builders expressed concern about tight availability of lots and a labor shortage.At the current sales pace, there was a 5.3 months\u2019 supply of new homes on the market in May, a relatively low level.\u201cUltimately this report is a disappointment for those looking to builders to meaningfully help solve the pressing supply issues in the market overall, especially for entry-level buyers,\u201d said Svenja Gudell, chief economist at Zillow.Earlier this week, the National Association of Realtors reported sales of existing homes, which make up the bulk of the market, rose 1.1% in May to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.62 million. The median property remained on the market just 27 days in May, the shortest time since the trade group began tracking the metric six years ago.\u201cThe pressure to close deals quickly, which has afflicted the existing home sales market, is also seeping into the market for new homes,\u201d Ms. Gudell said.New homes that weren\u2019t started but already sold reached 208,000, the highest level since May 2007.Write to Sarah Chaney at sarah.chaney@wsj.com and Jeffrey Sparshott at jeffrey.sparshott@wsj.comAppeared in the June 24, 2017, print edition as 'Buyers Fuel Market for New Homes.'", "news_time": "2017-06-23 12:34:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-new-home-sales-rise-in-may-prices-hit-record-1498226669", "news_title": "New-Home Sales Rise in May as Prices Hit Record Level", "keywords": "home construction, home prices, home supply, housing, multifamily housing,new home sales,single-family homes, u.s. economic growth, u.s. home sales,financial performance,earnings,sales figures,corporate,industrial news,economic performance,indicators,home sales,housing affordability,economic news,housing sales,housing prices,real estate markets,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,commerce department,executive branch"}, {"content": "How did the republic begin and evolve since its colonial days?

Both were times when a promising mix of full employment, low inflation and buoyant spirits gave way to a financial convulsion that triggered a recession. Unfortunately, the Federal Reserve under       Janet Yellen       is ignoring a relatively painless policy that would reduce the danger of a sequel.The debate surrounding the Fed\u2019s interest-rate decisions tends to follow a familiar script: Should the federal-funds rate be nudged lower or higher? Inevitably, this means parsing conflicting signals: Lately, inflation has been below the Fed\u2019s annual 2% target, which argues for low interest rates; but at the same time, unemployment is very low, and loose money may have pumped up asset prices unsustainably, both of which argue for higher interest rates.A different debate could help the Fed out of this bind. Even if Ms. Yellen\u2019s current, rather gradual pace is appropriate, the Fed can reduce the odds of a financial bust by tweaking the manner of its tightening.To do so, the Fed should examine a tenet of the central-banking faith: that transparency is always virtuous. By being less transparent\u2014and reserving the option of deliberately ambushing investors with a shock move\u2014the Fed could discourage them from taking too much risk.Such an ambush would unsettle markets, to be sure; but that would be the point. The painfully learned lesson from the late 1990s and mid-2000s is that excess financial serenity leads to excess risk-taking, which in turn increases the chances of a blowup. In the first case, that meant the tech bust of 2000; in the second case, it meant the planet-shaking subprime-mortgage meltdown. Since market convulsions caused the last two recessions, reducing the probability of the next one must be a Fed priority.This link between serenity and excessive risk-taking isn\u2019t just an observation about market psychology. It follows from the so-called Sharpe ratio, named after William Sharpe, a Stanford economist who won a Nobel Prize in 1990. The Sharpe ratio states that the attractiveness of an investment\u2014a stock, a bond or some bundled combination of financial instruments\u2014can be measured by its expected return (technically, the excess return over the risk-free rate, such as on Treasury bonds) divided by its expected volatility. A financial bet that you think will earn, say, 6% a year is extremely attractive if its volatility is low. But if markets are choppy and the risk looks large, 6% won\u2019t be worth it.It follows that, when risks seem modest, Wall Street borrows to make bets that look great based on the Sharpe ratio. Many algorithmic trading systems do this automatically: They are programmed to borrow more and bet bigger when recent market history indicates serenity. Human traders do this too, loading up on positions as volatility falls, in a strategy known as \u201cvol targeting.\u201dThen there is what Wall Street calls \u201cselling volatility.\u201d When markets are calm, a tempting way to juice returns is to sell insurance against future disruptions. Traders do so by selling options, collecting a premium for shouldering the risk that markets could collapse. The more traders do this, the more they induce trading behavior that makes their predictions of stability come true. The expectation of calm becomes self-fulfilling, until a shock causes a spike in fear\u2014at which point the alchemy of options intensifies the instability. A similar dynamic exacerbated the dramatic crash of 1987.In the past month, I have heard traders in London, New York and Singapore worry about the dangers of volatility selling. Frank Brosens, the co-founder of Taconic Capital, a hedge fund, has tried to gauge the size of this practice in U.S. equity markets: He isn\u2019t alarmed enough to bet aggressively on a collapse, he told me, but he has bought some cover against the risk of one.The longer the eerie calm in the market continues, the greater the danger that vol selling will spread. And the longer the real cost of short-term borrowing can be counted upon to remain negative or near zero, the likelier it is that financial excess will ultimately destabilize the economy.Given all this, why does the Fed accentuate this risky calm? Part of the answer is that its leaders don\u2019t like to play the villain. Chastened by the experience of the 1970s, they accept that they must raise interest rates and destroy jobs when inflation threatens. But the equally hard lesson of 2008 hasn\u2019t yet been absorbed: that they should embrace modest, short-term market instability to head off truly disruptive crashes over the horizon. Instead, the calmer markets remain, the prouder the central bankers feel.\u2018Facing an immensely complex task, central bankers are fatally attracted to simplicity.\u2019The other part of the answer is that, facing an immensely complex task, central bankers are fatally attracted to simplicity. In the \u201cmonetarist\u201d era of 1979-82, the Fed, like many central banks, presumed to steer economies by targeting a single measure\u2014the rate of growth of money. But it soon abandoned this project because \u201cmoney\u201d proved hard to define or measure.Similarly, in the 1990s, many central banks aspired to abolish exchange-rate volatility by pegging their currencies to the dollar. That project was ditched when it turned out that weaknesses within an economy can turn a currency peg into a currency crisis.The central-banking fashion now is to target inflation and to communicate prodigiously about coming interest-rate adjustments. Fed officials publish their expectations for interest rates over the next three years and telegraph changes via statements, speeches and interviews. But stable finance often matters more than stable prices. And transparency about future interest-rate moves can induce disruptive speculation.In January 2004, some three years before the subprime mortgage bust, the Fed saw financial risks building. With inflation low, the federal-funds rate was down at just 1%, which ran the risk of pumping up asset markets unsustainably. \u201cThe potential snapback effects are large,\u201d Fed Chairman       Alan Greenspan       acknowledged at the Fed\u2019s first interest-rate meeting that year. \u201cIn my view, we are vulnerable at this stage to fairly dramatic changes in psychology.\u201dLike today\u2019s Fed, in other words, Mr. Greenspan and his colleagues faced the danger that the interest rate that would stabilize consumer prices would also destabilize asset prices. The Fed could have escaped this dilemma by acting less predictably. Instead, it telegraphed its intentions and avoided surprises. The resulting calm in the markets was \u201ca central banker\u2019s dream,\u201d as one of Mr. Greenspan\u2019s colleagues said. \u201cThe market now pretty much anticipates how we\u2019re going to respond to various events,\u201d Mr. Greenspan rejoiced in May 2005.

Meanwhile,       Keith Weed,             Unilever\u2019s       chief marketing officer, told Wall Street Journal panel attendees that the industry needs a digital supply chain that is less \u201cmurky.\u201dSpeaking on a panel hosted by the International Advertising Association, Procter & Gamble Chief Brand Officer       Marc Pritchard      \u2014who earlier this year threw down the gauntlet, demanding agencies and tech companies clean up the online ad business\u2014said the industry is about 40% to 50% there in terms of fixing the digital supply chain. He is hopeful that by the end of the year it will be accomplished.Once again, the festival highlighted the fact that the ad business is under pressure to overhaul its workforce and attract more women and minorities.Civil rights activist Jesse Jackson talked up how brands can help raise social consciousness by highlighting different types of people and lifestyles. He also called on companies, to diversify their boards.The Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media released some alarming statistics during the festival that showed men get about four times as much screen time in ads as women and one-in-ten female characters are shown in sexually revealing clothing. The organization looked at 2,000 ads submitted to Cannes that were created in the last 10 years.\u201cWe need to talk less, do more and move faster,\u201d to solve this diversity problem, said       Antonio Lucio,        chief marketing officer of             HP Inc.       \u201cIt\u2019s becoming embarrassing.\u201dThe heavy topics didn\u2019t slow down the non-stop schmoozing that the conference is known for. Countless media owners, ad tech companies and platforms tried to dazzle marketers and agencies\u2014with the help of fine food and musical acts such as the Weeknd, Ed Sheeran, Phoenix and Solange Knowles\u2014in the hopes of convincing them to open their wallets. That\u2019s a far tougher task nowadays, as Facebook and Google snap up much of the money in the digital marketplace.The growing dominance of the two tech behemoths was a major topic at cocktail parties, as rivals struggle to find a way to grab their share of spending. Emarketer estimates that the tech titans earned 77 cents of each new dollar spent on digital advertising in the U.S. last year.Ad giants such as WPP,             Publicis Groupe SA       and             Omnicom Group Inc.       experienced slower growth in the U.S., during the first quarter, with some blaming global uncertainty and lackluster economic growth.Those business conditions had an impact on the foot traffic on the Promenade de la Croisette, as ad holding companies trimmed back the contingents they sent. With the festival markedly less crowded this year, attendees celebrated the fact that it was easier to get a table at the Carlton Terrace.Publicis made a splash (or belly flop) with the announcement that it\u2019s planning to take a year off from the festival and reallocate resources to a new internal technology platform called Marcel.The announcement triggered a backlash from employees and competitors who see value in the awards.Write to Suzanne Vranica at suzanne.vranica@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-23 12:01:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/cannes-2017-facing-harsh-ad-industry-realities-one-glass-of-rose-at-a-time-1498233672", "news_title": "Cannes 2017: Facing Harsh Ad Industry Realities, One Glass of Ros\u00e9 At a Time", "keywords": " cannes,cannescmo,marketing,markets,advertising,corporate,industrial news,digital marketing,public relations,business,consumer services,media,entertainment"}, {"content": "In \u201cBelievers Need Not Apply\u201d (op-ed, June 16), Sohrab Ahmari cites recent instances of progressive attacks on current and prospective public servants, both liberal and conservative, who adhere to evangelical or fundamentalist Christian theology. Sen. Bernie Sanders deemed Russell Vought, a Christian who asserted that belief in Jesus as the only begotten son of God, savior of humanity and path to everlasting life, as being \u201chateful\u201d and that Mr. Vought is \u201cnot someone who is what this country is supposed to be about.\u201dWhy do progressive fundamentalists pick primarily on believers in Judeo-Christian scripture? One doesn\u2019t hear Democrats insisting that Muslims express a belief that all Christians, Jews and atheists can enter paradise without converting to Islam. Not that long ago, classic liberals were defending John F. Kennedy from scurrilous attacks for being a Catholic believer; but now, if one doesn\u2019t worship at the altar of progressivism, one is a bigot who must be blackballed from government. Jesus told his followers, \u201cBlessed are you when people insult you, persecute you, and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of Me\u201d (Matthew 5:11). Christians fear for their lives in much of the world today, so being barred from the Washington swamp is a small price to pay for a Christian conscience\u2014but for the body politic in a free state, the cost is incalculable.Accommodation to progressive orthodoxy requires a Christian to reject the belief that Judeo-Christian scripture is God\u2019s holy word or to consider scripture to be suggestions subject to circumstances and higher and mightier human ideals. Believers can thrive in the Washington swamp, but nowadays only progressive believers need apply.Glen ReevesWashingtonSen. Sanders must realize that he was saying, in effect, I will not tolerate your Christian convictions. However, my not tolerating your Christian beliefs must never be construed as intolerance on my part. If a failure to tolerate another\u2019s beliefs isn\u2019t intolerance, what is it?David RoseCanton, Miss.Mr. Ahmari\u2019s piece seems to be based on the premise that all Christians are conservative on social issues. I object. All Christians aren\u2019t anything. Christianity is a broad, diverse religion and to assume we all believe the same thing is absurd and, candidly, insulting. As a Christian and a member of the United Church of Christ (which voted to support marriage equality in 2005), I believe \u201cliberal\u201d describes me well.Please don\u2019t assume or represent that all Christians hold conservative social views. It is patently false.Dave MookWheaton, Ill.Mr. Ahmari notes that liberals never seem to be satisfied with victory on an issue. Rather, they demand that individuals wholeheartedly endorse\u2014indeed love\u2014the ideas embodied in the victory. In essence they demand thought control.His op-ed echoes George Orwell\u2018s words in a 1940s essay: Thought control \u201cnot only forbids you to express\u2014even to think\u2014certain thoughts, but it dictates what you shall think, it creates an ideology for you, it tries to govern your emotional life.\u201dDan WhelanCape May Point, N.J.Don\u2019t Muslims believe that faith in God and his messenger Mohammed is necessary for eternal life?

But the Fed fails to recognize that favorable supply-side forces can keep inflation below its sacrosanct 2% target: forces such as increased retail competition, increased commodity supplies (particularly energy) and productivity increases. All these are good for economic growth, and they increase real incomes by keeping prices lower than otherwise. However, from the Fed\u2019s 2% viewpoint, they can be used as an excuse to delay interest-rate normalization, even though the economy is strengthening and can withstand an interest-rate increase.Conversely, adverse supply-side trends do the opposite. They push up prices, restrain real incomes and weaken the economy. But the higher inflation rates could encourage Fed rate increases even when a weaker economy is on the horizon. This failure to recognize the underlying causes of inflation and disinflation has the potential to drive monetary policy off a cliff by encouraging the wrong policy at the wrong time.Em. Prof. Robert F. StaufferRoanoke CollegeSalem, Va.Mr. Hubbard may be correct that the Federal Reserve\u2019s independence doesn\u2019t guarantee sound monetary policy, but his historical examples are not well chosen. Mr. Hubbard cites three periods in which the Fed made unwise policy, despite the fact that it had \u201csubstantial independence\u201d: the 1930s, 1965-1979 and the early 2000s.Since the era of an independent Fed really didn\u2019t begin until the Fed-Treasury accord of 1951, the example of Fed policy in the depression era is surely irrelevant. The next period cited by Mr. Hubbard\u20141965-1979\u2014encompassed the tenure of Arthur Burns, who had been notoriously bullied by President Richard Nixon into implementing overly accommodative monetary policy for Mr. Nixon\u2019s political ends.As for the third period\u2014the early 2000s, while the Fed was reasonably free of external political pressure, it had by then developed some dangerous habits of playing politics on its own.

Audi,        NSU -0.82%       the luxury Volkswagen brand that owns Ducati, commissioned investment bank Evercore to begin floating a potential sale of the boutique motorcycle maker to investors in March, according to the people, and is seeking up to \u20ac1.5 billion ($1.68 billion).Harley-Davidson, an iconic symbol of U.S. postwar culture, appears to be seriously considering a bid, these sources said. They said the company had engaged             Goldman Sachs                   and visited Ducati\u2019s plant and management in Bologna, Italy in early May.A Harley-Davidson spokeswoman said the company never comments on market speculation.Volkswagen declined to comment. Goldman Sachs didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment.One of the most technically advanced motorcycle makers in the industry, Ducati is renowned for its prizewinning high-performance racing motorbikes. Harley-Davidson, whose bikes are known as \u201chogs\u201d, faces an aging baby-boomer customer base and is eager to expand its business.Ducati sold 55,451 motorcycles in 2016, an increase of 1.2% from the previous year. Audi doesn\u2019t publish Ducati sales or earnings.The Italian brand is a small part of the Volkswagen empire, but analysts say a sale could generate momentum for further streamlining, including the much-awaited public offering of the company\u2019s truck business that includes the MAN and Scania brands.Arndt Ellinghorst,        an analyst at Evercore ISI, a London-based brokerage, said \u201ca deal would serve to increase our conviction that VW will carve out its trucks business, a much larger piece of the pie.\u201dAndreas Renschler,        head of the truck business, has said repeatedly that spinning off the business was an option, but that no decision had been made.At the height of the diesel emissions-cheating scandal, when Volkswagen was still unsure of the ultimate costs of resolving the affair, Ducati was one of a number of assets it marked for disposal should it need to raise cash, according to a person familiar with the situation.Since then, Volkswagen Chief Executive       Matthias M\u00fcller       has begun slashing costs and streamlining the company. He bundled some activities, such as the components business, fueling speculation that Volkswagen could spin off the business.Mr. M\u00fcller had his executives pull together what company insiders call the \u201cBest Owner List\u201d\u2014assets that might best be owned by someone else\u2014a person familiar with the situation said.In the early part of its 80-year history, Volkswagen was a one-product auto maker, churning out Beetles in Wolfsburg for export around the world. It has since amassed a varied stable in all market segments, including Audi, Spanish car maker Seat and Czech auto group Skoda.As CEO and later as chairman,       Ferdinand Piech,        scion of Beetle designer       Ferdinand Porsche,        took the Volkswagen brand upmarket as he had done previously with Audi, turning it into a competitor to             BMW                   and Mercedes-Benz. He scooped up three prestigious nameplates\u2014Bentley, Lamborghini and Bugatti\u2014in 1998 and acquired Ducati through Audi in 2012 from Industrialinvest, a private equity group, for about $1.2 billion.After Mr. Piech left the company this year and announced the sale of his shares in the family holding that controls the majority of Volkswagen\u2019s voting capital, analysts expected Volkswagen to begin peeling off some of the prestigious assets acquired under his tenure.But the diesel crisis has turned out to be more manageable than expected for the company, which sold 10.4 million vehicles last year, generated \u20ac217 billion in revenue, and sits on a cash pile of more than \u20ac20 billion.So far, Volkswagen has agreed to pay nearly $25 billion in fines, penalties and compensation to consumers. But it continues to generate large amounts of cash from its auto businesses, which people inside the company say has relieved pressure to dispose of assets quickly.A sale of Ducati isn\u2019t certain and could face opposition from labor, according to two of the people familiar with the situation.\u201cDucati is a jewel and its sale isn\u2019t supported by the labor representatives on the supervisory board,\u201d a spokesman for Volkswagen\u2019s works council, the in-house labor representative, said. \u201cTechnically, Harley-Davidson is miles behind Ducati.

Forensic artists can produce \u201caged\u201d photos, but the process requires talent, training and patience. Outdated images can also be a problem in routine security settings, when passport images, for example, fail to keep up with the years.That\u2019s why facial-age progression is a hot topic for researchers. Scientists are enlisting computers to automate the creation of facial images that age in sync with the people they portray. Now scientists at Britain\u2019s University of Bradford have adapted a statistical technique that they say can improve the accuracy of synthetically aging humans in photos.To make this method work, the scientists first used a database of roughly 30,000 images, many from the movie website IMDb.com. Some of these images portrayed the same person at different points in life\u2014an actor over the course of a career, for instance. The database also included some people who were relatives. The scientists annotated images so that the software\u2014a self-educating mathematical model, or algorithm\u2014would learn to take account of facial landmarks, differences in aging according to ethnic background and, finally, kinship, through the use of multiple relatives\u2019 faces.The resulting aged images were so good that a computer trained in standard facial-recognition techniques could match them to an image of the right person\u2014no matter what age\u2014from among a database of thousands with roughly 98% reliability, says       Hassan Ugail,        one of the Bradford scientists. That success suggests the technology might be useful in automatically aging a passport photo to see if it matches the live person facing the camera at a national entry point.The scientists acknowledged that, to the naked eye, some of their synthetically aged images look a little generic. One reason: The synthesized images were produced without hair and ears, because these were either inconsistent over time or missing in many of the training images. But this poses no problem for properly trained computers, which are more detail-oriented and less dependent on factors such as gender, age and expressions. \u201cThe way humans recognize faces is completely different from the way a computer does,\u201d says Dr. Ugail.Creating synthetically aged faces that remain recognizable to humans\u2014in other words, that retain a more consistent identity\u2014would be useful for finding missing persons or in security settings. A team of European researchers, including       Grigory Antipov       from France\u2019s Orange Labs, has attacked this problem with two mathematical models, one to generate aged faces and the other to see if those images can be matched to the original. If the second model can\u2019t make a match, the first has to keep trying new faces until the portrait is both aged and recognizable.The Bradford researchers were able to make some headway on this issue in working with a single face\u2014that of       Ben Needham,        who vanished on the Greek island of Kos in 1991, when he was 21 months old. The Bradford technique produced images, complete with hair and ears, of Ben over the years that 29 human volunteers found more recognizable than the aged images produced using more traditional techniques.\u201cFacial Age Synthesis Using Sparse Partial Least Squares (The Case of Ben Needham)\u201d by       Ali M.

Whirlpool Corp.      , the owner of the brand in the Europe and Asia Pacific regions, said it was working with authorities and was \u201caddressing this as a matter of utmost urgency.\u201dWhirlpool said that 64,000 such appliances were manufactured by Indesit Co. under the Hotpoint brand from 2006 to 2009. It said the model was discontinued in 2009, several years before Whirlpool acquired Indesit in 2014.During a refurbishment of the high-rise last year, contractors installed a widely used cladding\u2014material often used to make a building more energy-efficient or improve its outward appearance\u2014on the exterior of the building. The cladding consisted of an aluminum shell and a flammable plastic filling.The cladding is under scrutiny because of the swift spread and ferocity of the fire.In preliminary examinations, samples combusted soon after fire-safety tests started, Ms. McCormack said. Investigators immediately shared that information with local authorities throughout the country, she said.It wasn\u2019t immediately clear what the tests entailed.The U.K. government on Thursday said it had identified about 600 publicly owned residential towers that had installed some form of cladding. Authorities are now testing the cladding on those buildings to determine how many used the same material as Grenfell Tower.A government spokeswoman on Friday raised the number of cladding samples from high-rise public-housing buildings that had failed tests to 11 in eight local government areas. Firefighters will conduct further safety checks in the buildings and residents will be relocated if the building are deemed unsafe, she said.The cladding material, called Reynobond PE and made by             Arconic Inc.,       is marketed around the world. In the U.S., its use is generally limited to low-rise buildings because of fire-safety concerns. A spokeswoman for Arconic couldn't be immediately reached for comment.U.K. officials have said the material didn\u2019t meet building standards for towers taller than 18 meters, or about 59 feet. But British building industry experts and the British company that supplied the material to Grenfell Tower contractors said it complies with current building codes.The Premier Inn hotel chain told the British Broadcasting Corp. that it had concerns about the cladding used on three of its hotels, though it appeared to be of a less flammable type than that used at Grenfell Tower.The fire investigation might not conclude until the end of the year because of difficult conditions inside the tower\u2019s burned remains. Investigators are still trying to clarify the exact death toll of the fire and some victims may never be identified because of its intensity, Ms. McCormack said.She asked people to come forward if they have information on anyone who may have been in the tower at the time of the fire.Write to Wiktor Szary at Wiktor.Szary@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-23 10:41:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-k-police-say-cladding-from-grenfell-tower-failed-fire-safety-tests-1498215861", "news_title": "U.K. Police Say Grenfell Tower Cladding Fails Fire Tests ", "keywords": "cladding,grenfell,grenfell tower,high-rise fire,london fire,Arconic,ARNC,Whirlpool,WHR,U.K. government,labor,personnel,corporate,industrial news,workplace safety,health issues,political,general news,national,public security,crime,legal action,disasters,accidents,building fires,explosions,collapses,fire,rescue services,law enforcement,man-made disasters,murder,manslaughter,politics,international relations,domestic politics,primary metals,basic materials,resources"}, {"content": "When Acuity Insurance wanted to liven up its image among prospective recruits, it came time to bring in the zombies.It\u2019s the year 2023, and underwriter Carli Miller trudges through the insurer\u2019s Sheboygan, Wis., headquarters in a video Acuity has produced.She is clearly undead\u2014bloodless gray skin, glazed eyes, ripped clothing\u2014bumping into zombie colleagues who have overtaken the insurer.The 27-year-old Ms. Miller narrates and rattles off what she considers Acuity\u2019s perks\u2014the camaraderie, the \u201cjeans days,\u201d the great 401(k) plan. \u201cI guess the bottom line is Acuity truly was a great place to work,\u201d the ghoul concludes, \u201cand it\u2019s a great place to spend eternity\u2014even if we are undead.\u201dThe video, \u201cZombacuity,\u201d ends with a scream\u2014which might be a sign of what insurance-industry recruiters feel these days.For some reason, a lot of people just don\u2019t want to work for insurance companies, and the firms have been scared into taking extreme measures to lure new hires in and keep them.Acuity posted its video online to attract prospects. It picked zombies, says Acuity communications specialist Kallyn Vandenack, 30, to show \u201cwe really like to have fun around here.\u201dInsurers have put in climbing walls, offered free beer and massages, and published at least one graphic novel to entice and retain new hires. At school-recruiting events last autumn, Acuity served mounds of freshly cooked bacon, whose aroma drifted around the grounds.\u201cAll of the college students swarmed around,\u201d says Acuity Chief Executive       Ben Salzmann,        61.Americans under 30 generally aren\u2019t enthusiastic about the industry, according to Insurance Careers Movement, an industry group that seeks to inspire young people to pursue insurance careers. \u201cWhen I think of insurance,\u201d one millennial said in recent research conducted for Liberty Mutual Insurance, \u201cit is a sharp poke in the eye.\u201dThe industry needs more brains, and soon. It employs about 2.6 million but calculates it must hire 500,000 newcomers over the next several years as a wave of retirements hits, says Robert Hartwig, an insurance professor at University of South Carolina\u2019s business school.Some insurers are taking a page from Silicon Valley\u2019s hip offices.             Allstate Corp.       has a \u201chappiness guru\u201d in a building where it locates many data scientists.Acuity has in recent years installed ping-pong tables, a working 65-foot Ferris wheel, a 45-foot climbing wall and a 27,000-square-foot fitness center. It has twice-monthly happy hours. Years ago, it dropped its clean-desk policy banning plants, family photographs and food, Mr. Salzmann says.A graphic novel is       Dan Epstein\u2019s       millennial lure. The CEO of ReSource Pro LLC, which provides processing and advisory services to the insurance industry, co-wrote what is essentially a fancy comic book, \u201cTomorrow\u2019s Insurance,\u201d to engage young people in his company and clients about a transformation in the industry around data analytics and machine learning.At the novel\u2019s futuristic agency, Sigma 6 Insurance, the female owner walks among high-tech gear, escorting a mysterious guest who is assessing if the agency can insure a \u201cMars Colony One Project.\u201d The guest leaves definitely impressed.\u201cWe wanted to step out,\u201d says Mr. Epstein, 46, \u201cand envision what the industry could be like in 10 years.\u201dOther businesses, too, face labor shortages, says Professor Hartwig, 53, but \u201cit\u2019s without question more difficult to attract a worker into the insurance industry.\u201dAt a February Rutgers University event, lines of students waiting to meet recruiters from some tech firms ran 25 or more deep. Insurers\u2019 booths generally had trickles of guests.In a queue for the consultancy             Accenture,       finance major Nicholas Appaluccio, 23, said he wasn\u2019t interested in insurers because he considered much of the work there \u201ccut and dried.\u201dGraduate student Shivani Sethi, 24, approached Liberty Mutual\u2019s booth upon seeing no line. \u201cI\u2019m open to trying new things,\u201d she said, but ultimately took an internship at an online brokerage. Liberty Mutual says it collected 78 r\u00e9sum\u00e9s and offered interviews to four; two were offered jobs and took them.Videos are the enticement at firms such as ICW Group Insurance Cos., which last autumn rounded up employees to freeze in position\u2014at a time when \u201cmannequin challenges\u201d were an internet craze.In a video, a camera pans the firm\u2019s San Diego offices capturing the poses: someone about to sip a drink, another pushing an elevator button, one in midstep.The video, says Trisha Rule, 34, an ICW senior marketing employee, tackles \u201cthis misperception about the insurance industry.\u201dAmong viewers was Leslee Edwards, 22, who researched ICW on             Facebook                   and \u201cthought it looked like a fun place to work.\u201d In May, she started in the workers\u2019-compensation department.Interns at MMG Insurance in Presque Isle, Maine, helped create a seven-minute video modeled after \u201cThe Office\u201d television sitcom.In it, Melissa McKenney plays an underwriter who uses clairvoyance to size up risks. To dispel conceptions that insurance is \u201cboring or stale,\u201d she says, \u201cwe wanted to weave in a little bit of humor.\u201dMs. McKenney, now 23 and an MMG full-timer, says she previously figured insurance was monotonous but has learned it can be \u201cvery high-action, very fast-paced.\u201dTo keep some new hires away from the rest of the company, Allstate, Liberty Mutual and Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co. have put some data scientists, app developers and other innovation specialists in digs in neighborhoods popular with startups and given the operations catchy names.Allstate\u2019s Arity operation in Chicago\u2019s Merchandise Mart has a full-time \u201ccreative culture leader\u201d who helps in recruiting talent. \u201cWe\u2019re doing everything we can,\u201d says Allstate spokesman Justin Herndon, 36, \u201cminus throwing out the red carpet to try to get them in the door.\u201dAt Liberty Mutual\u2019s Solaria Labs, says spokeswoman       Adrianne Kaufmann,        49, there was \u201ca deliberate decision to give it a distinct personality that was more entrepreneurial in feeling.\u201dMassMutual opened a location it calls Haven Life in New York City where it wants \u201cspaces that feel start-uppy\u201d and \u201cwhimsical,\u201d says       Gareth Ross,        41, who has responsibility for data analytics at the 166-year-old insurer.The location has free beer anytime and some conference rooms named after \u201ccontributors to mortality\u201d: \u201cFallen Coconut,\u201d \u201cAsteroid Impact,\u201d \u201cInsect Attack,\u201d \u201cSnake Bite.\u201dWrite to Leslie Scism at leslie.scism@wsj.comAppeared in the June 24, 2017, print edition as 'Insurance Is a Fun Career!

Richard Webber       called the settlement \u201cfair and reasonable\u201d and said the amount should remain confidential.On Friday, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported that the city had agreed to pay $1.5 million \u201con behalf of multiple defendants,\u201d citing a city attorney\u2019s response to an open-records request from the newspaper.The defendants in the lawsuit denied any wrongdoing.Attorneys representing the city and the Brown family didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment.The lawsuit filed in early 2015 by Mr. Brown\u2019s parents Michael Brown Sr. and       Lesley McSpadden       against the city, its former police chief and the officer who shot Mr. Brown alleged that Mr. Brown was trying to escape and circled back toward the officer only when it was clear that he was badly wounded and needed help.Judge Webber said in his order that the agreement should remain sealed and considered a closed record under Missouri state law. \u201cDisclosure of the terms of the settlement agreement could jeopardize the safety of individuals involved in this matter, whether as witnesses, parties or investigators,\u201d he wrote in part.Mr. Brown was 18 when he was shot and killed during an encounter with a white police officer in August 2014.The suit alleged that Mr.\u00a0Brown\u00a0raised his hands and told the officer not to shoot.

The\u00a0U.S. Justice Department\u00a0also decided not to bring civil-rights charges against\u00a0Mr. Wilson, finding that credible witnesses supported his account that Mr. Brown attacked him.The Justice Department found a pattern of racial bias in the city\u2019s police and court system and reached a settlement last year with the city outlining steps to reform its police department and courts.Write to Kris Maher at kris.maher@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-23 10:40:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/ferguson-reaches-settlement-with-family-of-michael-brown-1498228840", "news_title": "Ferguson Reaches Settlement With Family of Michael Brown ", "keywords": "ferguson,legal settlement,michael brown,race relations,racial bias,wrongful death,Michael Brown,corporate crime,legal action,corporate,industrial news,settlements,out-of-court agreements,political,general news,national,public security,society,community,crime,discrimination,ethnic minorities,law enforcement,human rights,civil liberties,murder,manslaughter,racism,social issues"}, {"content": "When Apple Inc. unveiled the iPad tablet in 2010,       Charles Thacker\u2019s       wife remarked to her husband that he had once again been ahead of the curve. Nearly a decade earlier, Mr. Thacker, an electrical engineer, had helped design Microsoft Corp.\u2019s Tablet PC, a precursor to Apple\u2019s product.\u201cThat was the joke in our family,\u201d said his daughter Christine Thacker. \u201cHe was 10 years ahead of his time. Consistently.\u201dMr. Thacker played a leading role in inventing the first versions of many technologies that are foundational to devices today, including 1974\u2019s Alto, considered to be the world\u2019s first personal computer. In 2010, Mr. Thacker won the A.M. Turing award from the Association of Computing Machinery, the tech industry\u2019s Nobel Prize, largely for his work on the Alto.At             Xerox Corp.\u2019s       famed Palo Alto Research Center, where he developed the Alto, Mr. Thacker was part of an elite group of engineers that subscribed to what was a novel vision in the 1970s: Computers weren\u2019t meant simply for computing, but for promoting communication among people. That perspective led to Mr. Thacker\u2019s contributions to inventions such as the Ethernet, which became one of the most widely used ways to link computers.Read a collection of in-depth profiles at WSJ.com/Obituaries.Mr. Thacker had a talent for keeping his designs simple, aided by his unusual grasp of both hardware and software, a rare combination that allowed him to build the Alto. He pared down the physical parts and loaded the machine with a graphical user interface, which ultimately replaced text commands with icons like folders and a desktop that users could interact with using a mouse. That technology would later be a distinguishing feature of Apple\u2019s Macintosh and Microsoft Windows.\u201cThis guy is a real genius,\u201d       Alan Kay,        a researcher who worked with Mr. Thacker at PARC and a fellow Turing award winner, said in 2010. \u201cWe don\u2019t like to sling that word around in our field, but he is one. He is magic.\u201dMr. Thacker, known as Chuck to friends, died on June 12 at his home in Palo Alto, Calif., from complications from esophageal cancer, Christine Thacker said. He was 74 years old.Charles Patrick Thacker was born in Pasadena, Calif., on Feb. 26, 1943. His father was an electrical engineer who left the family when Mr. Thacker was young. He was raised primarily by his mother, who was a secretary at a Southern California grocery chain called Boys.After graduating from the University of California, Berkeley in 1967 with a physics degree, he worked for the university\u2019s Project Genie where he contributed to an early computer timesharing system. He went on to help found Berkeley Computer Corp., then joined Xerox PARC.Mr. Thacker was a humble and quiet man, except when he thought other people were making things too big and complicated. \u201cHis lifelong fight was against what he called \u2018biggerism,\u2019\u201d said Butler Lampson, who worked with Mr. Thacker for decades, beginning with Project Genie in 1968. Mr. Lampson, also a Turing award winner, is currently a technical fellow at Microsoft\u2019s New England research lab.The scale of his work impressed a young Ms. Thacker when her father took her to PARC. On one visit, she touched the MAXC, a giant microprocessor that was the size of several refrigerators and sat in its own air-conditioned room. \u201cJust to have him explain these things to me as a little child was just like speaking to a sorcerer,\u201d she said.In 1983, Robert Taylor, the head of the Xerox lab, who was revered by his engineers, including Mr. Thacker, suddenly split with the company over clashes with management. The same day, Mr. Thacker quit, telling the manager, \u201cActions have consequences, and I\u2019m quitting,\u201d according to Mr. Lampson. Mr. Thacker later joined Mr. Taylor at Digital Equipment Corp., as did about half the Xerox lab researchers, but Mr. Thacker was the only one to act so suddenly.In 1997, shortly after joining Microsoft Research Labs to help launch its lab in Cambridge, England, Mr. Thacker showed his new boss a new prototype. Mr. Thacker had sawed a             Sony                   laptop in half, flipped the keyboard around and put a digitizer surface on the screen\u2014an early version of a tablet, said his boss,       Rick Rashid.Mr. Thacker retired from Microsoft in February.

In the 1980s\u2014already famous for his painted landscapes of California pools and suburban houses\u2014he threw himself into drawn, painted and photographed self-portraits.The results, as well as Mr. Hockney\u2019s wider interest in photographic collage, are the main focus of \u201cHappy Birthday, Mr. Hockney,\u201d a celebration of his turning 80 at the Getty Center in Los Angeles, opening in two stages, June 27 and July 18. Most of the versions of Mr. Hockney on view, though, don\u2019t make for a cheery celebration. \u201cI usually only draw myself in down periods,\u201d Mr. Hockney told London\u2019s Telegraph newspaper in 2001. \u201cI suppose that\u2019s why I often draw myself looking grim. I just think, \u2018Let\u2019s have a look in the mirror.\u2019 When you are alone and you look in a mirror you never put on a pleasing smile. Well, you don\u2019t, do you?\u201dIn contrast to Mr. Hockney\u2019s landscapes, his self-portraits\u2014the photos, drawn works and paintings\u2014have never been available for sale and rarely go on public view. In this exhibition, 16 of them will be shown together for the first time.Born on July 9, 1937, in Bradford, England, about 200 miles north of London, Mr. Hockney played a role in the British pop-art movement. Enthralled by the 24/7 vibrancy of American cities, he eventually moved to Los Angeles, where he has lived off and on since 1964. Mr. Hockney\u2019s colorful, figurative paintings made him a favorite of critics and buyers: Last year, one of his paintings sold for $11.7 million, the highest-ever at auction for the painter.Since he was a teenager, Mr. Hockney has also experimented with ways to depict himself. One of his earliest self-portraits, from 1954, is a color lithograph showing him with dark hair, round glasses and awkwardly crossed arms. After that, co-curator       Julian Brooks       says it took Mr. Hockney a while to consistently \u201cconfront himself.\u201d In 1983 \u201cthe floodgates opened\u2026and suddenly he found [self-portraits] interesting,\u201d Dr. Brooks says. The artist started large series of them, principally using pencil and paper.At first the Hockney self-portraits showed vulnerability and self-consciousness, according to Dr. Brooks. But over the years, he adds, they showed intense self-examination. Mr. Hockney has depicted himself with his mouth wide open in surprise, with a scowl or with a cigarette hanging out of his mouth at an angle.At the same time, the exhibition reveals the many technologies Mr. Hockney has used, including photography, photocopy machines and watercolor. He was experimenting with software for sketching on a screen in the mid-1980s. In 2012, Mr. Hockney began making his latest batch of self-portraits on an iPad, using his fingers and a stylus to draw himself. Traditional watercolor paints layered on top of one another can lose definition and intensity; Mr. Hockney found that wasn\u2019t true of his iPad creations, Dr. Heckert says.\u200bWhile the part of the exhibition opening June 27 concentrates on self-portraits, the second stage focuses more on photography, especially collages made with Polaroids and photographic prints. Both parts of the exhibition will run until Nov. 26. Co-curator Virginia Heckert says these Polaroid collages \u201cforeshadow Photoshop,\u201d in that Mr. Hockney combines multiple images into something new.Instead of capturing a specific and decisive moment, Mr. Hockney\u2019s 1980s photos turned photography \u201cinto a different way of perceiving time,\u201d Dr. Heckert says. In his Polaroid composite \u201cBlue Terrace Los Angeles March 8th 1982,\u201d for instance, the viewer can see a deck, the view from the porch and the house itself, all from different perspectives. The result, Dr. Heckert says, is that the viewer moves through the images as if the composite were a landscape.Similarly, Mr. Hockney fractured reality and time in \u201cPearblossom Hwy., 11 -18th April 1986, #2,\u201d a location north of Los Angeles. He used nearly 800 different photos to capture what it was like to drive through California\u2019s dry Antelope Valley in northern Los Angeles County. Mr. Hockney layered and overlapped the prints on top of one another to make up the road, trees, sky and signs on the side.

May\u2019s increase was below market expectations for a 1.5% gain, according to economists at             Royal Bank of Canada.On a month-over-month basis, CPI in May edged upward 0.1%.Meanwhile, the average rate of core inflation, based on three gauges used by the Bank of Canada, slowed for a third straight month, to hit 1.3% in May. The three measures of core inflation\u2014which aim to get a better read on underlying price pressures in the economy\u2014ranged from 1.2% to 1.5%.The May CPI report will likely take \u201csome of the steam out of the bank-is-going-to-hike-rates-soon freight train,\u201d said       Doug Porter,        chief economist at BMO Capital Markets.The Bank of Canada sets rate policy to achieve and maintain 2% inflation.Expectations for a Bank of Canada rate increase this year strengthened markedly in the past two weeks, after the bank\u2019s top two officials struck a more bullish tone on the economy, arguing growth was broadening on a regional and industry basis.They signaled they were setting the groundwork to increase the policy rate, which sits at a near record low of 0.50%, adding that the two rate cuts it delivered in 2015 worked in helping the economy adjust to lower oil prices.Strong employment data and robust advances in wholesale and retail sales have also fueled rate-increase expectations, with markets pricing in a nearly 50% probability of a rate rise at the Bank of Canada\u2019s next policy meeting on July 12.The slowdown in May\u2019s CPI data has \u201chelped recalibrate market expectations\u201d for a rate increase, said       Brittany Baumann,        strategist at TD Securities. She said traders got excited Thursday after a stronger-than-expected retail-sales report for April, leading them to price in a greater than 50% probability of rate rise, according to trading in the overnight index-swap market.Expectations cooled considerably after the release of the inflation report, Ms. Baumann said, adding the OIS market now suggests a 30% chance of a July rate increase in Canada.In a speech this month, Bank of Canada Senior Deputy Gov.       Carolyn Wilkins       said below-target inflation was expected given the unused labor and industrial capacity, or slack, that built up in the economy.She added that the central bank must also be aware of how economic conditions will evolve when setting rate policy to reach 2% inflation.May\u2019s inflation report showed six of the eight components Statistics Canada tracks recorded increases in prices.Putting a damper on price increases was a 5.5% year-over-year drop in electricity costs. Statistics Canada said this was largely attributable to a move by the government of Ontario\u2014Canada\u2019s most populous province\u2014to legislate lower power prices for households.Total food prices fell 0.1% from a year ago, the eighth consecutive monthly decline. The drop in May was smaller than the previous month\u2019s 1.1% decline, and prices for fresh vegetables rose for the first time in nearly a year. The clothing and footwear index fell 1.5%.Meanwhile, gasoline prices rose 6.8% from May of last year, although that was slower than the previous month\u2019s nearly 16% gain. The homeowners\u2019 replacement cost\u2014or the price to maintain a residence at its current market value\u2014rose 4.4%, the biggest gain since 2010.On a seasonally adjusted basis, Canada\u2019s CPI fell 0.2% in May from the previous month.Write to Paul Vieira at paul.vieira@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-23 10:18:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/canada-inflation-slows-in-may-1498224630", "news_title": "Canada Inflation Slows in May ", "keywords": " bank of canada,bank of canada meeting,canada inflation, consumer prices, core index, cpi,electricity costs, inflation target, interest rates,may cpi,may data, monetary policy, rate increase,Bank of Canada,Statistics Canada,economic performance,indicators,inflation,prices,monetary policy,economic news,consumer price index"}, {"content": "A             Samsung                         group arm is on track to win European regulatory approval for a near-replica version of the world\u2019s top-selling drug,         AbbVie Inc.\u2019s       rheumatoid-arthritis treatment Humira, the latest achievement by the deep-pocketed South Korean conglomerate attempting to shake up the pharmaceutical market.Samsung Bioepis Co., the group\u2019s new biotechnology company, said in a statement Friday that it had received a positive opinion from the European Medicines Agency for its treatment, known as Imraldi. That decision clears the way for approval from the European Commission, whose judgment typically mirrors that of the EMA.If it gets the green light, Imraldi would represent the third Samsung-developed medication to win government approval in Europe and the U.S.\u2014an unusually fast start for a five-year-old company, industry analysts say. All three Samsung treatments are close imitations of rheumatoid-arthritis drugs that rank among the world\u2019s biggest sellers.In April, Samsung\u2019s version of         Johnson & Johnson\u2019s       Remicade won U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval to begin sales later this year. In Europe, Samsung has sold the Remicade near-replica and its version of Pfizer Inc.\u2019s Enbrel since last year.Biologic drugs, such as Humira or Remicade, are made out of living cells and treat complex diseases including cancer or arthritis. Annual treatments can total tens of thousands of dollars a year\u2014if not more, making them one of the most lucrative segments of the drug industry.However, with patent protections expiring, Samsung and other new players have been working to produce lower-priced near-replicas of biologic drugs, akin to the generic versions of chemically synthesized drugs like aspirin. Efforts to sell\u2014or block\u2014these so-called biosimilar treatments have led to a flood of lawsuits in the U.S. and Europe.In this world, Samsung, an empire accounting for nearly one-third of South Korea\u2019s stock-market value, is an unusual player: a well-resourced competitor whose fortunes aren\u2019t solely tethered to global health spending but spread across other industries from consumer electronics to construction.Samsung\u2019s Imraldi treatment, if approved by the European Commission, would be the second near-replica of Humira to receive regulatory backing, after         Amgen Inc.\u2019s       version was approved in the U.S. and Europe in September 2016 and March 2017, respectively.Humira, which is also used to treat other autoimmune diseases and is administered through injections, racked up more than $16 billion in global sales last year. A year\u2019s supply of Humira has a retail price of more than $50,000 in the U.S., with the costs varying by country in Europe.Christopher Ko, Samsung Bioepis\u2019s chief executive, said in a statement that the EMA\u2019s decision \u201cbrings us a step closer to delivering a lower-cost, high-quality autoimmune treatment option to patients.\u201dIndustry analysts expect Samsung, Amgen and other drugmakers will be able to roll out Humira biosimilars in Europe after AbbVie\u2019s main patent on the drug there expires in October 2018.Biologics had $202 billion in world-wide sales last year, and the drugs are expected to have $214 billion in sales this year, according to EvaluatePharma, a source of pharmaceutical market data and analysis. It estimates sales will reach $276 billion world-wide in 2020.In an echo of Samsung\u2019s earlier shift to focus on semiconductors and smartphones, the conglomerate has recently begun to embrace complex medicines as a potential source of growth.In addition to Samsung Bioepis\u2019s development of biosimilars of drugs whose patents are set to soon expire, another new Samsung affiliate,         Samsung BioLogics Co.      , is investing heavily to become the world\u2019s largest contract manufacturer of biologic drugs.Write to Timothy W.

But cost, time, stigma, distance to travel, language barriers and other factors prevent many from seeking help.Now, a growing group of health-care providers are betting that technology\u2014from web-based courses to mobile apps that send prompts via text\u2014can help bridge that gap.It might seem surprising, since therapy, more than many other kinds of medicine, is so focused on the relationship between patient and therapist. But research, including a meta-analysis of studies involving internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy, or CBT, suggests that digital therapies augmented by coaches who are available by text or phone can be as effective as evidence-based traditional therapy in treating some people with depression.One study, funded by the National Institutes of Health and involving 99 patients with moderate depression, found that 90 of them completed a full eight-week course that included access to a suite of treatment apps and text support from coaches with at least a bachelor\u2019s degree in psychology. On average, those who completed the course experienced a significant decrease in symptoms of depression, with three-fourths meeting the criteria for full remission. On average, participants used the apps more than 195 times over two months and interacted with a coach about twice a week.Elsewhere, a study by the U.K. National Health Service, based on 1.2 million referrals for depression and anxiety, showed that computerized CBT administered to people with depression yielded a recovery rate of 58.4%, compared with 53.9% for those undergoing several types of in-person therapy.       Ricardo F. Mu\u00f1oz,        a professor and founder of the Institute for International Internet Interventions for Health at Palo Alto University, who wasn\u2019t involved in the research, says that while patients with more severe depression may be more likely to seek in-person therapy, \u201cthe fact that much mild or clinical depression can be successfully treated with computerized CBT is of note.\u201dClinical psychologists put the first digital interventions for depression online about 15 years ago, according to       Stephen Schueller,        an assistant professor of preventive medicine at Northwestern University and a member of Northwestern\u2019s Center for Behavioral Intervention Technologies. \u201cWe basically thought, if it works in a self-help book, it will work online,\u201d he says. But what they found was that it was difficult to motivate patients with depression to engage regularly with what were essentially online PowerPoint presentations.Over the past five years, online therapies have evolved to include mobile apps such as Joyable, Lantern and Ginger.io, which are more personalized and responsive. They typically ask users to enter information about their moods and behaviors, then offer problem-solving suggestions, prompts to help patients retrain responses to negative situations, and daily health tips.Dr. Schueller believes digital interventions need to continue evolving with technology to remain effective. \u201cThe future is trying to better understand how to make these apps and sites engaging,\u201d he says. \u201cThat will include clinical psychologists working with experts in augmented reality, virtual reality and gaming to develop mobile solutions that are truly novel.\u201dOne such tool might look like Koko, an online messaging chatbot that uses the internet community to address emotional distress. With Koko, a user puts in a negative thought, like \u2018I\u2019m stupid,\u2019 and sends it out to other people who may be working through similar situations, Dr. Schueller says. \u201cThe crowd creates responses, which go through the system and come back to you as a new message: \u2018Maybe you didn\u2019t fail because you\u2019re stupid, but maybe because you didn\u2019t sleep enough or you didn\u2019t study enough.\u2019 \u201dThe idea is that the crowd \u201ccan provide many different ideas that, when combined, might produce better or more creative solutions\u201d than a therapist can, says Dr. Schueller, adding that Koko also uses machine learning to identify those in need of more direct intervention or support.Lynn Bufka,        associate executive director of practice research and policy at the American Psychological Association, says research has demonstrated that individuals can benefit from a range of technology-enabled services. As such, she would like to see a more \u201cstepped\u201d approach to mental-health care for individual patients.Stepped care might start with a brief in-person assessment of a patient who shows signs of depression, so that therapists can identify any behavioral or health concerns, says Dr. Bufka, who believes that a human should always be involved at the beginning of a treatment process. \u201cThen, depending on severity, we would provide each patient with a self-help book or access to web-based education. If that didn\u2019t work, perhaps we\u2019d move to a computer-assisted intervention, and then move toward in-person treatment,\u201d either group or individual sessions, Dr. Bufka says. The stepped-care system exists in the U.K., she says, where providers in the National Health Service identify patients with moderate depression and other problems and offer self-help or technology-enabled services. \u201cI think we\u2019ll ultimately see a combination of different online interventions\u201d for depression, she says.Dr. Mu\u00f1oz of Palo Alto University says he also believes that therapeutic and preventive services for depression could fall on a continuum.The challenge for the public is knowing which digital tools to trust, he says, pointing to PsyberGuide, a website headed by Dr. Schueller that uses a standardized rating system to help consumers select products and apps for various mental-health conditions, as a good model.Eventually, Dr. Mu\u00f1oz envisions something he calls massive open online interventions, where therapeutic and preventive services could be delivered virtually to anyone in the world, in any language, at any time\u2014ideally at no charge to users. The only barrier to entry would be internet access. Once the technology is built and more people use it, he says, the marginal cost of providing that intervention to one more person would gradually approach zero.He points to a study he conducted in which 15,170 smokers from around the world participated in a free online smoking-cessation program offered in English and Spanish. After 12 months, 3,479 users, or 23%, reported they had quit smoking; to help that many people quit using more common care, he says, health providers would have had to give nicotine patches to 17,395 smokers, at a cost of $3.65 million.His program, which had been built with earlier research grants, cost a total of $200,000 to maintain and advertise the website world-wide for 30 months.\u201cWith the political will and across-the-board standards, we can give an intervention to anyone, even people who don\u2019t have access to a mental-health clinic or antidepressants,\u201d he says. \u201cAll they need is access to a smartphone with a data plan.\u201dMs. Mitchell is a writer in Chicago.

The list includes Anbang Insurance Group Co., which bought New York\u2019s Waldorf Astoria for nearly $2 billion; HNA Group Co., which invested $6.5 billion in the Hilton hotel chain; and Dalian Wanda Group, which bought Hollywood producer Legendary Entertainment for $3.5 billion.Many bankers said the probe could further damp Chinese companies\u2019 appetite for investments abroad, which had already taken a hit after regulators worried about capital flight tightened oversight of big deals at the end of last year.Some bankers said they fear the investigation will discourage cross-border deals done by companies of all sizes, and that some clients have already put deals on hold while they assess the situation. Deals that have been announced but haven\u2019t closed yet may run into trouble with regulators, one banker said.Another concern is that if Chinese banks, which account for a large proportion of the financing for Chinese companies\u2019 overseas deals, slow or curb their lending, that will hurt investment activity as well, said people who work in the deals world in Hong Kong.The recent probe follows a crackdown on excessive leverage by Chinese regulators, who are concerned that ballooning debt levels could slow the economy and threaten the financial system. Since many big Chinese conglomerates are privately held and don\u2019t disclose much, it is tough to assess just how much debt they have. Still, bankers and data trackers say the most aggressive acquirers appear to be highly leveraged.HNA Group, for instance, said it had around $104 billion in debt at the end of last year, which would give it a high debt-to-earnings ratio.HNA said the group \u201cis in a sound financial and operational situation\u201d and fully complies with regulators in all the countries in which it operates.\u201cMany have been surprised at the amount of debt these conglomerates have been able to take on and the willingness of Chinese banks to lend,\u201d said Michael DeSombre, a Hong-Kong based partner at Sullivan & Cromwell LLP. The regulator\u2019s actions are a \u201ca natural follow-on in terms of things getting out of hand with large-scale leverage and willingness to go buy things.\u201dChina\u2019s outbound deal volume, which hit a record last year, has already slumped following the tightened capital controls implemented at the end of 2016. Chinese dealmakers announced overseas investments of $69.77 billion so far this year, versus $128.8 billion a year earlier, according to data from Dealogic. Bankers say some of the more outlandish deals, or those that don\u2019t align with the buyer\u2019s core businesses, haven\u2019t been coming to market since December.Some bankers applauded the move to investigate the prominent Chinese deal makers, saying such scrutiny would help overhaul a debt-ridden system that could be exposing banks to trouble. One banker said he was surprised regulators hadn\u2019t acted earlier, and that the current exercise is a \u201csanity check\u201d for companies with complicated and opaque balance sheets.Others say they hope to offset any loss of revenue from slowing Chinese deal-making by focusing on other business opportunities, such as helping Chinese companies go public in the U.S., or expanding M&A work elsewhere in the region.Write to Julie Steinberg at julie.steinberg@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-23 09:47:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/bankers-brace-for-chill-in-helping-chinese-companies-buy-overseas-1498225654", "news_title": "Bankers Brace for Chill in Helping Chinese Companies Buy Overseas ", "keywords": "banks,china,hong kong market,overseas acquisitions,regulator,Dalian Wanda Group,dalian wanda,HNA Group,regulation,government policy,regulatory bodies,ownership changes,acquisitions,mergers,divestments,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,government finance,government borrowing,economic news,diversified holding companies,business,consumer services,banking,credit,financial services"}, {"content": "The U.S. Supreme Court has never declared a voting-district map unconstitutional for giving one party a political edge, but a pair of legal scholars hopes a metric they devised will change that.On Monday, the high court announced it would hear the appeal of a U.S. District Court decision that invalidated the Wisconsin state assembly district map for being unconstitutionally partisan.A foundation of the original complaint is a mathematical formula known as the efficiency gap that measures the impact of partisan gerrymandering.If the Supreme Court\u00a0concludes the Wisconsin plan is unconstitutional\u2014as it has racially gerrymandered maps that watered down the influence of minorities\u2014the efficiency gap could become part of a legal test that would change the way states draw district boundaries.\u201cThe hope is that in the future there would be a judicial limit to how extreme partisan gerrymandering could be,\u201d said Nicholas Stephanopoulos, a lawyer for the plaintiffs and a professor at the University of Chicago Law School who helped craft the metric.The case argues that partisan gerrymandering violates the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment by deliberately disadvantaging supporters of a particular party and the First Amendment by punishing certain voters because of their political affiliations.Partisan gerrymandering occurs when the majority party draws boundaries that concentrate supporters of the opposition into a few voting districts or spreads them thinly across many districts. The strategy, known as \u201cpacking and cracking,\u201d reduces the number of seats the minority party can win relative to the number of votes its supporters cast.If a system were proportional, a party that won 50% of the statewide vote would claim 50% of the seats. In a partisan gerrymander, it might win 50% of the vote but claim only 20% of the seats.Determining \u2018wasted\u2019 votes1Wasted votes are all those cast for a losingcandidate as well as those cast for a winnerin excess of the number needed for victory.Hypothetical legislativedistrict with 100 votesParty Awins, butwastes20 votes", "news_time": "2017-06-23 09:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/formula-measures-impact-of-partisan-gerrymandering-1498222800", "news_title": "Formula Measures Impact of Partisan Gerrymandering ", "keywords": " congressional districts, democratic party,elections,electoral law, republican party,voting, voting districts, voting rights,U.S. Supreme Court,political,general news,crime,legal action,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,judicial branch"}, {"content": "Jon Maier may not rank among Wall Street\u2019s biggest money managers, but he is as close to royalty as the $3 trillion exchange-traded fund industry gets.Mr. Maier was, until May, the man who picked the ETFs that go into the prepackaged investment portfolios sold by Merrill Lynch. During his eight years in the role, assets ballooned from less than $1 billion to more than $40 billion. He became so well-known in the industry that the strategies acquired the nickname \u201cthe Maier models,\u201d much to the dismay of Merrill Lynch.Now he has walked away from his power perch to become the first chief investment officer of Global X Management Co., a privately held ETF issuer that just crossed $5 billion in assets.Global X is banking on Mr. Maier\u2019s name to help boost growth, and plans to launch ETF portfolios of its own.Hiring Mr. Maier \u201cwill help them open doors,\u201d said Joe Zidle, portfolio strategist at Richard Bernstein Advisors and a former colleague of Mr. Maier\u2019s.ETFs are growing at a record pace, with the number of U.S. funds topping 2,000. There are ETFs investing in municipal bonds, African equities and complex derivatives, all bought and sold on exchanges just like company stocks.To navigate the thicket of competing products, investors are increasingly turning to off-the-shelf ETF portfolios. That makes model managers some of the most influential investors in the business. Mr. Maier\u2019s picks for Merrill Lynch could make or break a fund\u2019s success.\u201cThey\u2019re increasingly causing these huge swings in assets,\u201d said Dave Nadig, chief executive of ETF.com, an industry news website owned by             CBOE Holdings Inc.,       an exchange company.Market insiders saw Mr. Maier\u2019s handiwork in a series of enormous trades that rolled through popular ETFs in late January. The Vanguard Short-Term Bond ETF drew $1.27 billion in new cash, its biggest single-day gain. Investors yanked $900 million from the Vanguard Growth ETF, the most since January 2008. The             iShares Core MSCI EAFE ETF,       which buys European stocks, took in $540 million, at the time its third-largest inflow.Merrill Lynch declined to comment for this article.That Mr. Maier, 48 years old, became an industry hotshot is something of a joke to those who know him. One described him as a \u201ccool nerd.\u201d He drives a 2015 Jeep Cherokee and owns a weekend house in East Hampton, though he points out that it isn\u2019t on the posh, oceanfront side of the highway. His partner, Peter Fletcher, is a computer-science teacher. They have a 6-year-old son and a rescue mutt named Rufus.A New Jersey native, Mr. Maier began his Wall Street career after graduating from Emory University and serving a stint in the Peace Corps, where he helped newly privatized Ukrainian companies adjust to a market economy. He joined PaineWebber & Co. in 1996 as a fund analyst, and stayed after the company was bought by UBS Group AG in 2000. Merrill, now part of             Bank of America Corp.      , hired him in 2007 and put him in charge of ETF portfolios two years later.The models had been largely neglected until Mr. Maier took over, said Mr. Zidle, who was deputy director of Merrill\u2019s research investment committee. The committee decided which sectors and industries to buy and sell, and Mr. Maier\u2019s job was to pick the ETFs that fit.Mr. Maier visited thousands of advisers to pitch the models. Instead of buying dozens of ETFs, investors simply picked a portfolio, leaving the behind-the-scenes trading and rebalancing to the home office in New York.Along the way, if advisers had a question, they knew Mr. Maier would answer his own phone. His approachability earned him a following, and the \u201cMaier models\u201d moniker stuck.\u201cThe models will keep growing without me, but they grew initially because of me,\u201d said Mr. Maier.For the sales staff at ETF issuers such as             BlackRock Inc.       or             State Street Corp.      , getting added to the Maier models was reason to pop Champagne and start mentally spending next year\u2019s bonus, according to people who have dealt with him, but who declined to be named because their employers\u2019 policies prohibit it.As the models gained assets, Merrill Lynch executives became increasingly uncomfortable that the \u201cMaier model\u201d sobriquet placed too much emphasis on one employee, according to people familiar with the matter. Mr. Maier said he began to feel hemmed in by the very success he helped create. The bigger the models became, the less say he had on the direction of the business.When Global X offered him a chance to build something new, he took it.             Morningstar Inc.       ranks the eight-year-old firm 11th in ETF inflows this year. Last year,             J.P. Morgan Chase                   & Co. bought a 10% stake for an undisclosed sum. Mr. Nadig estimated the firm\u2019s value at $150 million to $250 million.At Global X\u2019s Manhattan offices, in a conference room equipped with a foosball table, chief executive Bruno del Ama outlines what he calls his \u201cstretch goal\u201d for the 40-person firm: 1% of the ETF market within five years\u2014or about $30 billion, six times current assets.The Global X sales staff is already using Mr. Maier\u2019s weekly talking points to gain traction with advisers. New ETF portfolios may not be far behind.They\u2019ve already decided on a name: The Global X Maier Models.Write to Asjylyn Loder at asjylyn.loder@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-23 09:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-man-who-walked-away-from-a-40-billion-etf-post-at-merrill-lynch-1498222800", "news_title": "The Man Who Walked Away From a $40 Billion ETF Post at Merrill Lynch ", "keywords": "derivatives,equities,etfs,exchange-traded funds,financial adviser,institutional investors,money managers,u.s. bonds,Merrill Lynch,plans,strategy,corporate,industrial news,banking,trusts,funds,financial vehicles,financial investments,investment banking,portfolio,fund,asset management,credit,exchange traded funds,financial services,investing,securities"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014President       Donald Trump      \u00a0predicted the four Republican senators who said they wouldn\u2019t support the current Senate GOP health-care bill eventually would back it in some form.\u201cI think that they\u2019ll probably get there,\u201d he said of conservatives       Ted Cruz       of Texas,       Ron Johnson       of Wisconsin,       Mike Lee       of Utah and       Rand Paul       of Kentucky, in an interview that aired Friday.On Thursday, hours after the Senate Republican leadership unveiled their bill aimed at repealing much of the 2010 Affordable Care Act and reshaping the federal-state Medicaid health program, the four senators said the bill in that form didn\u2019t go far enough, though they also said they were open to negotiation.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t even sound like Obamacare lite, in some areas it may be Obamacare plus,\u201d Mr. Paul said in a different Fox News interview\u00a0Thursday.The Republicans hold 52 votes in the Senate. All Democrats are expected to oppose the health-care bill, so Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) can lose no more than two GOP votes to pass it.Mr. Trump acknowledged the schism between centrist and conservative Republican senators over measures in the bill.Conservatives have said they would like to roll back some regulations established by the ACA to help lower costs, but those changes could meet resistance from other Republicans. Some centrist Republicans, meanwhile, say they have concerns over elements in the current bill such as a one-year stripping of funding for women\u2019s health organization Planned Parenthood and dramatic cuts to Medicaid funding to the states.\u201cIt\u2019s a very complicated situation from the standpoint, you do something that\u2019s good for one group but bad for another,\u201d Mr. Trump said.The president also condemned the unanimous Democratic opposition to the bill, calling the minority party \u201cobstructionist\u201d and criticizing House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi of California. Mr. Trump said he hopes she doesn\u2019t step down from her leadership position, referring to questions some Democrats raised about her role in the party\u2019s recent string of losses in special elections for House seats.\u201cI think that it would be a very, very sad for Republicans if she steps down,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cI\u2019d like to keep her right where she is, because our record is extraordinary against her.\u201dSeparately, Mr. Trump also called the relationship between fired FBI director       James Comey       and       Robert Mueller,        who was appointed special counsel to investigate Russian meddling in the 2016 elections, \u201cbothersome,\u201d but he stopped short of saying Mr. Mueller should recuse himself.\u201cWe\u2019ll have to see,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cBut Robert Mueller is an honorable man, and hopefully he\u2019ll come up with an honorable solution.\u201dWrite to Sharon Nunn at sharon.nunn@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-23 08:58:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-predicts-quartet-of-gop-critics-eventually-will-back-senate-health-bill-1498222730", "news_title": "Trump Predicts Quartet of GOP Critics Eventually Will Back Senate Health Bill ", "keywords": " affordable care act, donald trump, gop, health care bill, mike lee, rand paul, rob portman,senate, ted cruz,Donald Trump,political,general news,health,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,lower house,upper house"}, {"content": "Ten years ago, hailing a cab meant waving one\u2019s arm at passing traffic, consumers routinely purchased cameras, and a phone was something people made calls on.The iPhone, released a decade ago this month, changed all of that and more, sparking a business transformation as sweeping as the one triggered by the personal computer in the 1980s.             Apple Inc.\u2019s        AAPL 0.63%       gadget, and the smartphone boom that followed, gave rise to whole new industries, laid waste to others and forced new business models.By essentially compressing a powerful, networked computer into a pocket-size device and making it easy to use,       Steve Jobs       made the internet almost ubiquitous and fundamentally altered decades-old consumer habits in areas like music and books. What\u2019s more, the functionality packed into the iPhone made it a digital Swiss Army knife, supplanting existing tools from email to calendar to maps to calculators.\u201cIt combined size, power and personalization,\u201d said       Paul Nunes,        managing director at global consulting and services firm             Accenture                   and author of \u201cBig Bang Disruption,\u201d a book about transformational technologies.The upheaval triggered by the iPhone, and the launch of Google\u2019s Android operating system for smartphones the following year, led to new innovations like apps that continued to transform industry.Entrepreneurial coders and upstart businesses could now reach consumers directly, creating new modes of shopping, entertainment, travel and more. App stores today offer an estimated 3.5 million to 3.6 million choices, including games, fitness programs, shopping and dating, according to audience-measurement firm Verto Analytics Inc.Apps also made it easier for big companies to connect with customers: airlines use them to expedite flight check-ins, banks to handle check deposits, and restaurants to automate ordering.That activity has been a catalyst for the growing dominance of tech-industry titans.             Alphabet Inc.\u2019s       Google and             Facebook Inc.       now get the bulk of their advertising revenue from mobile-ads. Together with Apple,             Microsoft Corp.       and             Amazon.com Inc.,       they are the five most valuable companies on the stock market today. Ten years ago, only one of the top five was a tech company.Along the way, smartphones disrupted communication. By offering faster, easier ways to communicate\u2014text, photo, video and social networks\u2014\u201cthe iPhone destroyed the phone call,\u201d says       Joshua Gans,        professor at the University of Toronto and author of the book, \u201cThe Disruption Dilemma.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s funny we even call it a phone.\u201dSmartphones didn\u2019t start social media. Facebook launched in 2004 on desktop PCs. But they made social networks and messaging apps like Facebook\u2019s WhatsApp, Instagram and Messenger, along with             Twitter,       Snapchat and others, pervasive and indispensable. As of March 31, at least 1.94 billion users were checking into Facebook at least once a month.As mobile audiences grew, so did the time individuals spent on their phones. Average usage had risen to 73.8 hours a month by June of last year from 68.2 hours the prior year, much of it on social media, according to a report by comScore released later in 2016.Advertisers have redirected their spending accordingly, wreaking havoc on established news companies. In 2015, total mobile ad spending in the U.S. overtook print ad dollars, according to eMarketer. Last year, Facebook captured 14% of the $190.6 billion global digital advertising revenue, second only to Google\u2019s 32.8%. And in the first quarter of 2017, Facebook\u2019s 49% rise in revenue was largely fueled by online advertising.Smartphones have also laid waste to the camera industry\u2014even as they made photos more relevant than ever. Digital camera shipments fell 80% between 2010 and 2016 to 24 million, according to the Camera & Imaging Products Association. Among the casualties:             Eastman Kodak Co.      , the iconic film company that was already reeling from the onslaught of digital cameras. In 2012, it declared chapter 11 bankruptcy and has reorganized to focus on commercial imaging markets.Most photos taken today aren\u2019t printed and kept, but tweeted, messaged or posted. That gave rise to the $20 billion-plus IPO in March of             Snap Inc.,       the disappearing-messaging app. It calls itself a camera company.Smartphones have paved the way for new technologies that have led to faster production cycles and unpredictable competitors, says Accenture\u2019s Mr. Nunes.Garmin Ltd.\u2019s       navigational device technology was groundbreaking. In 2005, sales of its GPS devices were exploding despite retail prices of $700 and above. Within four months of the introduction of the iPhone, equipped with Google Maps, Garmin had gone from posting record earnings at the end of 2007 to missing expectations in early 2008. Its stock, which was trading around $100 at the end of 2007, had fallen to under $20 a year later. The company has since diversified into wearables and other markets besides autos; its stock is now trading in the $50 range.As existing businesses evaporated, the iPhone spawned new industries and business models. Ride-hailing firms Uber Technologies and Lyft are built on apps; a smartphone is the price of entry for both riders and drivers.From the days of the phonograph, people have owned music, whether vinyl records, compact discs or downloads from iTunes. The smartphone accelerated a move away from that concept to effectively renting music from subscription services like Spotify and Apple Music.Artists and labels, who earn far fewer royalties on these new services, have fought the move but for a flailing music industry, streaming has this year been a shot in the arm. A doubling in paid streaming music subscriptions last year drove an 11.4% increase in retail revenue to $7.7 billion\u2014the industry\u2019s biggest gain since 1998, according to the Recording Industry Association of America.Nowhere has the smartphone\u2019s impact been more pronounced\u2014or unexpected\u2014than in telecommunications. A month before the iPhone was launched,       Randall Stephenson,        chief executive of AT&T, Apple\u2019s exclusive partner in the U.S. at the time, told a financial audience: \u201cI believe the iPhone is going to be a game changer.\u201dIt was, but not in favor of telecoms. The iPhone became such a hit with consumers, who lined up and camped out for days to buy it, that it tipped the balance of power. Manufacturers like Apple could now set tougher terms and demand more concessions from carriers.Wireless companies were able to capitalize on soaring data use for a while, as consumers became more addicted to their smartphones. But the shift to data plans from texts and calling minutes made it easier for users to treat their cellphone service like a commodity.Wireless service revenue among the top U.S. carriers grew 5.9% in 2008, the first full year the iPhone was on the market, following years of double-digit growth, according to investment bank UBS Group AG. Revenue, which has been falling in recent years amid increased competition, slipped 1.6% last year.Many carriers are now rushing to diversify their revenue streams as their customer bases stagnate\u2014most developed nations already have more active smartphones than people\u2014and persistent competition keeps them from raising prices.\u2014Drew FitzGerald contributed to this article.Appeared in the June 24, 2017, print edition as 'What the iPhone Wrought.'", "news_time": "2017-06-23 08:56:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/from-music-to-maps-how-apples-iphone-changed-business-1498210201", "news_title": "From Music to Maps, How Apple\u2019s iPhone Changed Business", "keywords": "apple,apple iphone,cellphone,consumer tech,consumer tech: apps software,consumer tech: cameras,consumer tech: smartphones wireless,iphone,iphonedecade,iphone impact,mobile apps,mobile phone,smartphones,steve jobs,tech transformation,Apple,AAPL,Lyft,AT&T,T,Steve Jobs,marketing,markets,advertising,advertising spending,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,arts,entertainment,living,lifestyle,music,personal technology,sciences,humanities,telecommunications,computers,consumer electronics,telecommunications technology,equipment,mobile communications equipment,personal electronics,photographic equipment,printing,publishing,newspaper publishing,retail,wholesale,etailing,telecommunication services,wireless telecommunications services,print advertising,public relations,business,consumer services,cellular,mobile phones,consumer goods,digital cameras,e-commerce,electronic navigation,tracking systems,satellite navigation systems,handheld electronic devices,industrial electronics,industrial goods,internet,online,leisure,travel goods,media,social media platforms,tools,technology,sharing economy services"}, {"content": "The entire point of the annual exercise in labor allocation otherwise known as the NBA draft is to give the worst teams the best players. Those teams are usually so bad, however, that one player isn\u2019t enough to make them good. Not even LeBron James could drag the Cleveland Cavaliers to the playoffs in his first two seasons.It\u2019s almost impossible in the NBA for a team to suddenly transform itself.But that\u2019s what happened in this draft. The Minnesota Timberwolves, who finished this season with a 31-51 record, haven\u2019t made the playoffs in more than a decade and are still the Minnesota Timberwolves, became one of the NBA\u2019s better teams overnight.The Timberwolves were somehow able to swing a blockbuster deal for Chicago Bulls forward Jimmy Butler that secures their core of Butler, Karl-Anthony Towns and Andrew Wiggins for years to come. They\u2019re not beating the Golden State Warriors this year. But they\u2019re now one of the few teams in the NBA that have the makings of something that might\u2014might\u2014be able to beat the Warriors in the next several years.The Timberwolves using the draft to their advantage even before they made a single pick was not what anyone would\u2019ve expected when the event began. It was the one twist in an event that went almost exactly the way the world\u2019s millions of draft experts predicted.What didn\u2019t happen was more notable than what did. Paul George didn\u2019t get rented by a title contender. Kristaps Porzingis didn\u2019t get traded, so Madison Square Garden didn\u2019t burn. The presumptive lottery players didn\u2019t fall too far, and the fringe players weren\u2019t picked too soon. Even their suits didn\u2019t have a remarkable number of buttons. It was a night of total normalcy, and that\u2019s what made it so abnormal.The downside of so much speculation about so many wild scenarios before the draft is that something unforeseen occurring almost by default means it has to be something truly nuts. But the upside is the NBA can still be truly nuts.The evening was going to plan as the Philadelphia 76ers took Markelle Fultz and the Los Angeles Lakers were about to nab Lonzo Ball when news broke on Twitter\u2014where else?\u2014that one of the league\u2019s most promising teams was pulling the trigger on a trade for one of the league\u2019s most talented players.Minnesota wanting Butler had barely even been a rumor. This was a stunning move involving a star that was done in secret. It was truly nuts.LaVar Ball wearing a Big Baller Brand cap already customized in Lakers colors because \u201cthe words of Zeus, Jesus, everybody\u201d said his son was going to be a Laker didn\u2019t seem all that interesting afterward. That\u2019s how big the Butler trade was: It briefly made LaVar Ball irrelevant.But it wasn\u2019t only the Timberwolves getting Butler that made their night a success. It was also the way they got Butler: on the cheap. He cost them Zach LaVine, Kris Dunn and dropping back nine spots in the draft\u2014a modest price for one of the NBA\u2019s best two-way players.\u201cIf there was a way to get a player of Jimmy\u2019s ability,\u201d said Minnesota coach Tom Thibodeau, his former coach in Chicago, \u201cwe were going to do it.\u201dEven the reliably coolheaded, statistically rigorous ESPN analyst       Kevin Pelton      couldn\u2019t understand Chicago\u2019s reasoning. He gave the Bulls an F for the trade. He gave the Timberwolves an A+.Fultz, Ball and every other player drafted on Thursday might become All-Stars some day. Butler already is one. He\u2019s only 27 years old. He\u2019s coming off the most efficient season of his career. But what makes him especially valuable is that he\u2019s under contract at a reasonable price for at least the next two years. He\u2019s a player the Timberwolves can build around.They already had foundational pieces in Towns and Wiggins, the No. 1 picks of the 2014 and 2015 drafts, in part because that\u2019s how a team like the Timberwolves had to be assembled. Minnesota is a lovely place with charming people. Minnesota is not a destination for NBA free agents. At least not yet. The Timberwolves\u2019 most reliable way of getting players like Butler, Towns and Wiggins was drafting them\u2014or trading for them with players they had already drafted.That\u2019s why it wasn\u2019t a surprise that Minnesota improved on draft night. The only surprise was how.The Timberwolves didn\u2019t have to make a brilliant decision by the time they were on the clock. They had already crashed the stage, dapped Adam Silver and stolen the draft. They already had Jimmy Butler.Write to Ben Cohen at ben.cohen@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-23 08:26:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-minnesota-timberwolves-won-the-nba-draft-1498220789", "news_title": "The Minnesota Timberwolves Won the NBA Draft", "keywords": "Golden State Warriors,Timberwolves,basketball,sports,recreation,routine general news"}, {"content": "Berlin and MunichBy the time Germans go to the polls for a national election in September, Europe will have endured more than a year of electoral turmoil. Most observers expect the German vote to come as a relief. In contrast to votes in Britain, Italy, the Netherlands, France, Britain again and maybe also Italy again, Germany will be staid and stable, both voting the \u201ccorrect\u201d way and not giving anyone reason to worry that it will do anything else.There\u2019s one problem: Germany\u2019s election is too stable.Chancellor       Angela Merkel,        cruising toward re-election for her fourth term, is easily Europe\u2019s most boring center-right politician. She\u2019s dialed back her one genuinely controversial decision\u2014to throw open Germany\u2019s doors to more than a million Middle Eastern migrants in 2015\u2014without entirely repudiating it.It\u2019s unfair to accuse her of complacency, and she\u2019ll offer some modest tax cuts and other kitchen-table policies to woo middle-class voters rather than merely resting on her laurels. But everyone knows her main selling point will be continuity at home and abroad.Contrast that with       Theresa May,        who despite her \u201cstrong and stable\u201d tag line attempted a wholesale makeover of Britain\u2019s Conservative Party and then failed;       Fran\u00e7ois Fillon,        who ran for France\u2019s Republican presidential nomination on the strength of a Thatcherite program; or       Mark Rutte       in the Netherlands, who kept his seat by embracing what Europe\u2019s mainstream thinks are controversial views on assimilation of immigrants. They weren\u2019t all right or successful, but at least they tried to respond to the public\u2019s demand for more ideas from the political class.The German left is equally soporific. The center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD) has rallied behind a 61-year-old man who spent the past 22 years in Brussels.       Martin Schulz       is no       Gerhard Schr\u00f6der,        and he criticizes many of the labor-market reforms that Mr. Schr\u00f6der implemented as SPD Chancellor in the early 2000s.But Mr. Schulz is no       Jeremy Corbyn       either. His economic platform, in contrast to Mr. Corbyn\u2019s industrial nationalizations and redistributive taxation, is a few relatively modest tax hikes and more money for schools and roads. The flashiest pledge is an expansion of government-pension spending that is no more or less unaffordable than the mainstream center-left approach anywhere.Germans might not see anything wrong with this. Politics here has often been fierce in the postwar period but never radical. You wouldn\u2019t expect either the center-right CDU or the center-left SPD to embrace a leader like       Donald Trump       or Mr. Corbyn.Germans briefly flirted with the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) and neo-Communist die Linke (Left), but polls suggest voters already have come home to the two major parties, well before the curfew of the September election.The drawback is that this creates an almost entirely content-free election when voters everywhere else are anxious to debate serious issues. Germany should be ripe for a better campaign than it\u2019s getting. Headline economic data are strong, with growth hitting 1.9% last year (it\u2019s good for Europe), unemployment at 4.2%, and a record fiscal surplus of \u20ac54 billion ($60.17 billion).But those numbers mask serious problems. Growth of inflation-adjusted earnings shows signs of slowing as inflation picks up. Unemployment is low because millions of people have been pushed into underemployment.Germany\u2019s mainstream parties are committing malpractice by not tackling these matters head-on now, in this election, when the global economy is providing a growth tailwind. They\u2019ll regret not doing so if the economy falters under protectionist pressure from America or new bouts of Brexit-induced uncertainty\u2014to name only two threats\u2014and voters turn again to more exciting fringe candidates for new ideas.For now the task of providing some excitement falls to the plucky Free Democratic Party (FDP), the party of entrepreneurship and a smaller state. After an electoral downturn in 2013 the party is waging a comeback under charismatic leader       Christian Lindner.       He made his name in 2015 with a viral YouTube video excoriating an SPD member of a state parliament for mocking entrepreneurs like Mr. Lindner. The best outcome in September might be that Mrs. Merkel is forced to form a coalition with a revived FDP, and Mr. Lindner pulls her grudgingly toward tax reform and deregulation.Someone sane has to start doing politics, because experience everywhere has shown that if mainstream politicians don\u2019t do it, eventually voters will turn to fringe parties that will. Germany shouldn\u2019t assume it\u2019s immune to this trend. It might merely be late to the uprising.", "news_time": "2017-06-23 08:05:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/beware-europes-quiet-election-1498154944", "news_title": "Beware Europe\u2019s Quiet Election", "keywords": " angela merkel,christian lindner, elections,germany, martin schulz, populism, tax reform,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,elections,national,presidential elections,commentaries,opinions"}, {"content": "Greetings from Cannes. We\u2019re at the business end of the advertising festival now and it\u2019s a good time to reflect on some of the excellent campaigns that won awards this year. My personal favorites were State Street\u2019s \u201cFearless Girl\u201d statue, which took home three Grand Prix, Burger King\u2019s print ads that depicted real restaurants that had burned down, with the tagline \u201cFlame Grilled Since 1954,\u201d and Afghanistan Ministry of Health\u2019s \u201cImmunity Chain\u201d -- a beaded bracelet for babies to wear that tells doctors everything they need to know about the child\u2019s vaccinationsI\u2019m not sure many people would have predicted that the big story out of Cannes this year was the fact that one ad group has decided it\u2019s had enough. Loyal readers of this newsletter will remember that earlier this week, Publicis Groupe announced it will be skipping Cannes in 2018 and will reroute the savings into an artificial intelligence platform called Marcel. It\u2019s all anyone can talk about this week. But as my CMO Today colleagues in Cannes reported, Publicis staffers are miffed. Publicis Groupe CEO Arthur Sadoun said in a memo to staff that \u201cearly feedback has been overwhelmingly positive.\u201d I can just imagine the conversation, over a glass of champagne on a Michelin Star beach restaurant: \u201cYes, Arthur, the industry really must cut *sip* down on this *glug* sort of thing.\u201d Meanwhile, Cannes Lions managing director Jose Papa told The Drum \u201cthere are a lot of misconceptions about the expense\u201d of the event. He also said, in his previous sentence in the interview, that passes start at \u20ac1,595 for two days.We\u2019ve been hearing during Cannes about Amazon\u2019s ability to upend the ad business on so many fronts -- with its data, burgeoning ad tech play and, of course, its media adventures. Now, here\u2019s something: Reuters reports that Amazon is planning to charge advertisers $2.8 million for ad packages so they can appear during the National Football League games it plans to stream this coming season. Amazon is reportedly offering ten 30-second slots each game, plus ads on Amazon.com during the football season. Amazon seems to be undercutting Twitter, which reportedly charged advertisers up to $8 million for its NFL streaming ad packages -- but the fee is a lot higher than the half a million dollars TV broadcasters typically offer for national NFL TV ads, according to the report. Until now, Amazon Prime streaming has been ad-free, but the NFL gives the company a gateway to begin seizing significant TV ad budgets. Could more ad-funded content be on the way?Another hot-button topic at Cannes has been diversity, or the lack of it, within the ad industry. There were countless sessions and meet-ups this week about improving equality within ad land. A billboard created by trade magazine Campaign and Mother London featuring top advertising execs calling for equality was prominently positioned above Le Grand Hotel. I\u2019d suggest following the @Adcolor Instagram account that has been championing the achievements of a diverse mix of Cannes attendees. But if you ask any executive at Cannes, it\u2019s clear Madison Avenue has plenty of work left to do. Speaking on a panel hosted by The Wall Street Journal, marketers said outside forces are needed to fix the diversity problem. Madonna Badger, founder of creative agency Badger and Winters, pointed to Uber\u2019s recent crisis as an example of where investors can drive change.Keeping with the ad tech theme: Ad buyers say Snap\u2019s ad tech platform is more sophisticated than Facebook\u2019s was in the early days, according to AdExchanger. Facebook\u2019s topsy-turvy ad tech adventure was chronicled by one of its former product managers, Antonio Garcia Martinez, in the appropriatley titled book \u201cChaos Monkeys.\u201d Facebook recently shut down the Facebook Exchange and the LiveRail supply-side platform it acquired, and it wound down the Atlas ad server it acquired from Microsoft in 2013. Snap, of course, hasn\u2019t been around as long as Facebook but it is learning from its missteps and triumphs, according to the article.

But seven years after that work began, the dam is unfinished and isn\u2019t expected to be complete until 2019\u2014four years behind schedule.The myriad issues hampering\u00a0the Calaveras Reservoir project show how difficult it can be to repair or replace an old dam, which is of growing concern nationally.An estimated 27,380 or 30% of the 90,580 dams listed in the latest 2016 National Inventory of Dams are rated as posing a high or significant hazard. Of those, more than 2,170 are considered deficient and in need of upgrading, according to a report by the American Society of Civil Engineers. The inventory by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers doesn\u2019t break out which ones are deficient.But both funding and inspection staffing to deal with the problem are considered inadequate, the civil engineers\u2019 report said. An estimated $64 billion is needed to upgrade those dams, including $22 billion for the ones posing the highest hazard, according to the Association of State Dam Safety Officials, a nonprofit safety group in Lexington, Ky.\u201cIt\u2019s a huge problem with limited resources,\u201d said Ivan Wong, a consulting seismologist from Walnut Creek, Calif., who works on dam projects nationally. \u201cWe can barely pay for our schoolteachers, but if a dam fails and there\u2019s a population downstream, we\u2019re talking about a disaster. We have to fix our dams, there\u2019s no doubt about it.\u201dWhile no dam collapses have claimed lives in the U.S. in recent years, historically they have represented some of the nation\u2019s biggest disasters. The failure of a dam above Johnstown, Pa., in 1899 sent a wall of water into the town, killing 2,209. The near failure of an emergency spillway at California\u2019s Lake Oroville in February, following heavy rains, prompted the evacuation of nearly 200,000 people downstream.The Anderson Reservoir near San Jose, Calif., spilled over in February, despite a state-imposed limit of holding 68% of capacity because it lies near an active fault. Hundreds of homes were flooded along Coyote Creek, in what officials of the local Santa Clara Valley Water District say could have been a much more serious disaster had the dam failed.\u201cThere was an unprecedented level of rainfall that came in very rapidly,\u201d said Katherine Oven, deputy operating officer of the district, which plans to rebuild its dam, too.At the Calaveras dam, California\u2019s Division of Safety of Dams in 2001 ordered the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission to keep its 31 billion-gallon capacity Calaveras Reservoir no more than 40% full.Utility officials say the extra time is needed to make the dam\u2014with a massive 1,200-foot-wide base and spillway walls up to 4 feet thick\u2014hopefully failproof.\u201cIt\u2019s better to plan for the worst and hope for the best,\u201d Dan Wade, who oversees the $800 million project for the city utility, said on a tour on Wednesday as trucks moved rock and other material around freshly excavated earth. The cost is double the original $400 million estimate.Earthquakes pose especially big risks for dams. The seismic threat is highest along the geologically active West Coast, including Washington and Oregon, which scientists say could see rare but potentially catastrophic quakes.The seismic risk also exists for dams in places like the Midwest where there have been infrequent, large temblors. A series of earthquakes measuring more than 7.0 magnitude jolted what is now the New Madrid, Mo., area in 1811 and 1812.Few states face as much of an earthquake threat as California, where nearly three-fourths of the state\u2019s 1,585 dams are rated as having high or significant potential risk of failing.Like its predecessor and many others in California, the new Calaveras dam is being constructed largely out of rock, dirt and other natural materials. Engineering experts say earthen dams, if they are of sufficient size, are designed to withstand most earthquakes.\u00a0The Calaveras dam is being strengthened, in part, by having zones of compacted material, including a thicker core of impermeable clay.One problem, experts say, is that many were built decades ago, when less was known about what a strong earthquake could do.Engineers didn\u2019t realize then that the loose rock and soil they used to form the base of some dams could liquefy in a strong earthquake, potentially causing the top of the structure to deform and spill. As a result, state officials have ordered some dams to hold back less water until they are fortified.About 40 miles to the north, state officials have determined the 220-foot-high\u00a0Calaveras\u00a0Dam poses a flooding threat because the base of the 92-year-old structure was built atop loose earth on the site of a previous failed dam. About 300,000 people live in a flood zone along Alameda Creek below.\u201cIt would be disastrous if this thing were to fail, because you have huge urban areas downstream,\u201d said Jeff Miller, executive director of the Alameda Creek Alliance, a nonprofit environmental group.Officials of the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission say they opted to rebuild the dam 400 yards downstream, in part they say because there was uncertainty on whether the debris from the failed dam debris could be adequately secured.\u201cThe problem is they didn\u2019t clean up all that material,\u201d said Mr. Wade, who is the utility\u2019s program manager to rebuild Calaveras and other parts of a system that San Francisco uses to transport water from the Sierra Nevada mountains to 2.6 million people. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t understood the foundation could liquefy.\u201dBut building a new 220-foot dam has presented its own challenges.\u00a0About two years into the work, workers discovered remnants of two landslides that occurred an estimated 20,000 years ago. Fearful an ancient slide could foreshadow another one, Mr. Wade said the utility spent about two years redesigning the project and taking out even more earth as a precaution.The work now is under way in earnest at Calaveras. So far, about 7 million cubic yards of earth have been moved, with another 3 million to go\u2014or the equivalent of 1,550 football fields buried 1 yard deep. Last year, crews finally began constructing the earthen dam itself and much of the rest of their work will be in raising it to its height of about a 22-story building.\u201cRight now, we\u2019re doing the glory work,\u201d Mr. Wade said, standing on an overlook to watch the bustling commotion below. \u201cIt\u2019s like painting a house: A lot of the hard work is in the preparation.\u201d", "news_time": "2017-06-23 08:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/california-reservoir-on-shaky-ground-highlights-aging-u-s-dams-risks-1498219201", "news_title": "California Reservoir on Shaky Ground Highlights Aging U.S. Dams\u2019 Risks ", "keywords": " california reservoir, dam upgrades,dangerous dams, san francisco bay, u.s. dams,American Society of Civil Engineers,political,general news,disasters,accidents,earthquakes,volcanic activity,landslides,natural environment,floods,tidal waves,natural disasters,catastrophes,air,water,land quality,risk news,heavy construction,dam construction,construction,real estate"}, {"content": "Australia is sending patrol planes to the Philippines\u2014where\u00a0it has long deferred to the U.S. on security issues\u2014as it takes a more assertive role against terror threats in Southeast Asia.Two Australian P-3 Orion aircraft will support Philippine troops fighting the Muslim-extremist Maute group on the southern island of Mindanao, Defense Minister       Marise Payne       said Friday.The deployment marks the first time Australia has directly interceded in the long-running conflict in the southern Philippines. Just days earlier, it announced an aid package for people displaced by the fighting in the Mindanao city of Marawi.\u201cThe regional threat from terrorism, in particular from Daesh [Islamic State] and foreign fighters, is a direct threat to Australia and our interests,\u201d Ms. Payne said Friday.Security experts fear that disparate extremists are coalescing in Mindanao under Islamic State banner, establishing themselves in a country with a thriving illegal-arms trade and ready supply of brutal criminal factions.The Philippine military has received training and advice from foreign powers including the U.S. and Australia\u2014but given the fraying ties between the U.S. and Philippines under President       Rodrigo Duterte,        Australia\u2019s expanding role is less contentious, analysts say. Mr. Duterte last year declared his \u201cseparation\u201d from the U.S., a longstanding ally.Australian Foreign Minister       Julie Bishop       was one of the first senior officials to visit the Philippines following Mr. Duterte\u2019s election a year ago. On that trip she urged closer regional cooperation to prevent Islamic State from \u201cmetastasizing\u201d and making the area a launchpad for radicalized fighters, and expressed concern about militants\u2019 declaring an Islamic caliphate in the southern Philippines.\u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear they\u2019re trying to emulate what ISIS has done in the Middle East,\u201d said       Alan Dupont,        a strategic analyst at the Lowy Institute, a foreign-policy think tank in Sydney. \u201cMarawi would be a magnet for disaffected people in Southeast Asia, including in Australia.\u201dAustralia has more at stake in the Philippines conflict than the U.S., Dr. Dupont added, because it is much closer.The Philippines appears to be \u201changing on the edge of stability,\u201d said       Peter Jennings,        one of Australia\u2019s top strategic advisers and the head of the government-backed Australian Strategic Policy Institute. Several hundred fighters already may have returned to Mindanao from the Middle East, he said.Australia reached an agreement with the Philippines in 2012 allowing deeper military engagement, a deal whose roots went back a decade to a 2002 bombing on the Indonesian resort island of Bali that killed 202 people, including 88 Australians.\u00a0Several of the Islamic militants responsible fled to Mindanao, historically a haven for Indonesian terrorists.\u201cLooking at what Australia\u2019s now doing, it looks like a very similar response,\u201d said       Malcolm Cook,        senior fellow at the Iseas-Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore.Australia has experienced five deadly terror attacks by so-called lone-wolf assailants since 2014, increasing worries about homegrown militancy. It has increased the powers of intelligence agencies and police to monitor and detain suspected extremists, and to prosecute returning fighters.Canberra, long a U.S. ally, has also sent warplanes and special forces to the war on Islamic State in Syria and Iraq.Prime Minister       Malcolm Turnbull       told a security conference in Singapore recently that Australia is willing to step up its counterterrorism efforts: Islamic State terrorists should be \u201ckilled in the field,\u201d he declared. Australia and Indonesia will jointly host a regional counterterrorism summit in August and push for more cooperation among disparate Southeast Asian nations against both foreign and homegrown militant fighters.Facing a surge in hostage-taking by Islamic militants last year, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines agreed to conduct joint patrols in waters off the southwestern Philippines and allow their maritime forces to pursue suspected criminals into each other\u2019s waters.

Senate GOP leaders released a proposal Thursday that would undo major parts of the Affordable Care Act and transform a large part of the U.S. health-care system. The bill would reverse the ACA\u2019s expansion of Medicaid, a move that could affect millions of people, and would for the first time limit states\u2019 overall Medicaid funding from Washington. It would also eliminate the requirement that most Americans sign up for health insurance and reduce the size of tax credits aimed at helping people afford coverage. Additionally, the proposed legislation would repeal hundreds of billions of dollars in taxes on businesses and high-income households and retroactively cut taxes on capital gains. The plan in many ways echoes a health bill passed by the House last month, but it was unclear if the differences in the Senate\u2019s version, such as the shape of the tax credits and a more gradual phasing-out of the Medicaid expansion, would be enough to attract more-centrist Republicans without alienating the most conservative lawmakers in both chambers. Underscoring the challenge, four conservative members suggested they couldn\u2019t support the bill. Senate GOP leaders said they expect a vote next week.The largest U.S. banks survived a hypothetical \u201cstress test\u201d and could continue lending even during a deep recession, the Federal Reserve said, a strong report card that could bolster the industry\u2019s case for cutting back regulation. In the first part of its annual tests, the Fed said 34 of the largest U.S. banks have significantly improved their defenses since the 2008 global financial crisis. The results signal that many banks could win the Fed\u2019s approval to increase dividend payouts to investors next week, in the second round of the tests. The outcome gives ammunition to the Trump administration and congressional Republicans, who view some of the rules put in place after the financial crisis as excessive and want to ease them in the name of buoying economic growth. However, supporters of the rules say healthy banks show the regulations are working.Government-owned Qatar Airways intends to buy a significant stake in American Airlines\u2014a brash attempt by the fast-growing Middle East carrier to push into the U.S. against a backdrop of political upheaval at home. However, American Chief Executive Doug Parker said in an interview Thursday he was \u201cnot happy\u201d about the prospect. In a filing, American said it was informed by Qatar Airways\u2019 CEO, Akbar Al Baker, that it planned to acquire up to 10% of the U.S. carrier. According to American, Qatar\u2019s plan involves buying at least $808 million of its stock on the open market, or roughly 16.7 million shares at Wednesday\u2019s closing price. The proposed investment has raised eyebrows in part because the two carriers have been on opposite sides of a bitter industry fight.

Taiwan\u2019s             Foxconn Technology                   Group is preparing to decide on seven states where it plans to spend some $10 billion to expand its contract manufacturing operations, the WSJ\u2019s Yoko Kubota reports, moves that will draw in Foxconn\u2019s sprawling network of suppliers and parts distribution. Foxconn\u2019s U.S. ambition comes amid a flurry of U.S. investments announced by Asian companies as President       Donald Trump       seeks to stimulate American manufacturing.       Terry Gou,        chairman of the company formally known as             Hon Hai Precision Industry Co.        2317 -0.43%      , says the company will build out supply chains, a big boost for transportation and logistics providers in an industrial economy that\u2019s lost some of its might in recent decades. Manufacturing reached a low of 11.6% of the U.S. economy in the last quarter of 2016, and the electronics industry has taken a growing share of the factory output.Foxconn isn\u2019t the only Asian electronics giant building up in the U.S.Samsung                   Electronics Co. is in late-stage discussions to invest about $300 million to expand its U.S. production at a South Carolina factory, the WSJ\u2019s Timothy W. Martin reports, and would take over a site that             Caterpillar Inc.       is leaving. The decision is a boost for the Port of Charleston, which is about 150 miles away, and would draw in parts distribution as well as potential exports from the home appliances Samsung plans to produce. Samsung rival LG Electronics also plans to build a washing machine factory in Tennessee, its first major U.S. plant. Both companies are making a calculation that reining back logistics and shipping costs by producing appliances close to U.S. customers will more than offset potentially higher labor costs. More manufacturers may come to that conclusion if the new investments from Asia pay off.While Asian manufacturers go west, a Silicon Valley icon is looking toward starting factory work in China.             Tesla Inc.       says it is exploring with government officials in Shanghai opening a facility to build electric vehicles, and the WSJ\u2019s Tim Higgins and Trefor Moss report the auto maker would make its signature cars there for the Chinese market while most of Tesla\u2019s production would remain in the U.S. Tesla Chief Executive       Elon Musk       has said that making its vehicles in China would help cut prices for the vehicles by a third by reducing shipping costs and avoiding import duties. China production would bring new complications for Tesla\u2019s supply chain, however, adding tough questions for a business that has struggled at times to ramp up production in line with sales. China\u2019s regulations require vehicle components be sourced locally, pushing batteries from Tesla\u2019s big Nevada \u201cgigafactory\u201d out of the picture.The Arab states embargo on trade with Qatar is triggering a business boom for logistics companies in Turkey. Transport demand through the Turkish capital of Ankara is already soaring, and several Saudi Arabian companies are finalizing plans with Turkish logistics companies to ship cargoes through the country to Qatar. The blossoming trade is a vivid illustration of how business and profits are moving ahead, the WSJ\u2019s Yeliz Candemir writes, even as diplomatic relations in the region remain fractured. Teksan Lojistik, one of Turkey\u2019s largest logistics companies, says its orders have jumped 110% since the political crisis erupted on June 5.

Just ask shareholders in Nasdaq-listed             Weibo,        WB -0.20%       the country\u2019s wildly popular version of             Twitter.Nasdaq-listed Weibo\u2019s shares lost $1 billion, or 6%, of their value Thursday after China\u2019s media regulator ordered the social media company to stop streaming video and audio content. Not only does Weibo not have the relevant licenses, according to the regulator, but it\u2019s also posting commentary programs that propagate so-called \u201cnegative speech.\u201dIf that sounds chilling, the reality may not prove quite so bad: Weibo users were still able to view videos freely on Friday. Beijing\u2019s intervention may just amount to a nudge for Weibo to clean up its political content. Tencent, which operates China\u2019s largest social network,             WeChat,       received a similar warning in May. A month on, WeChat is still buzzing.That should offer some relief for investors as video has been an important ingredient in Weibo\u2019s stellar growth over the past two years. Nearly a fifth of its advertising revenue came from video ads in the first quarter, according to Goldman Sachs. Moreover, the popularity of videos, especially live-streaming ones, has drawn more users to the site, boosting overall advertising income. Weibo\u2019s share price has almost quadrupled since the beginning of last year.Yet with a growing amount of content on its site, Weibo faces a tough task in making sure it is all politically acceptable. Just two weeks ago, the government shut down some WeChat and Weibo accounts about celebrity news\u2014usually considered safe politically. The increased scrutiny is probably to do with an important party congress later in 2017 that will name China\u2019s leadership lineup for the next five years.Putting a price on the political risk that Weibo faces is tricky, given Beijing\u2019s unpredictability. Still, it\u2019s clearly a sensitive time for China\u2019s rulers and companies like Weibo operate in treacherous waters.

Bush       administration. Critics of the case\u2014known as a Section 232 investigation\u2014say broad tariffs would lead to higher domestic prices for steel, hurting auto makers and other consumers of the alloy, as well as generating retaliation from trade partners.\u201cIt will encourage others to restrict our exports, even in unrelated sectors, which only hurts the growth of jobs and paychecks here at home,\u201d said Rep.       Kevin Brady,        the Texas Republican who chairs the House committee that oversees trade policy. \u201cDone hastily, we raise costs and prove to our partners that we aren\u2019t reliable.\u201dThe resistance in Congress is notable because lawmakers\u2014including many Democrats\u2014generally welcomed the Trump administration\u2019s overall goal of getting tough on trade partners by enforcing trade rules.But some worry that the administration, by dusting off a rarely used provision of U.S. law aimed strictly at security threats, could open the door for other countries to bar a variety of U.S. exports over national-security concerns.Congress doesn\u2019t get to vote on tariffs imposed at the executive level, but it could seek to repeal the law granting the president such powers.Rep. Lynn Jenkins, a Kansas Republican,\u00a0asked U.S. Trade Representative       Robert Lighthizer       during a hearing on Thursday if steel tariffs based on national security could lead other countries to restrict wheat exports from Kansas for the same reason.Mr. Lighthizer, the administration\u2019s newly confirmed point person on trade, defended the administration\u2019s view that the American steel industry is a vital part of national security, and that protecting it with tariffs may be worth the risk to steel-consuming industries and other sectors that could be hit by retaliation.\u201cSteel, aluminum\u2014these are national security issues,\u201d Mr. Lighthizer told the House hearing\u00a0on Thursday, the second day of hearings on trade. \u201cThe president will look at this very, very hard.\u201dSo far, Mr. Lighthizer and Commerce Secretary       Wilbur Ross      \u2014who is leading the steel and aluminum investigations\u2014have given few signals about how the steel probe\u2019s findings or what Mr. Trump might ultimately decide to impose as a remedy. Officials say the steel probe should be finished by the end of the month, while a similar Section 232 case on aluminum could take longer.People close to the trade case say different parts of the administration have strongly different views about what should be done, making the case another example that pits \u201ceconomic nationalists\u201d who want to defend suffering American industries against officials advocating freer trade that benefits companies more broadly.\u201cI know you get this: When we put tariffs or quotes on steel or aluminum there will be a sweeping effect on American manufacturing,\u201d Democratic Sen.       Claire McCaskill       told Mr. Lighthizer.Her state of Missouri is home to transformer factories that probably can\u2019t be supplied by domestic sources alone, beer brewers that use aluminum for cans, and a machinery remanufacturing plant that doesn\u2019t want to pay higher prices for steel, aides said.Sixteen Democratic lawmakers from the House and Senate\u00a0on Tuesday\u00a0sent a letter to Messrs. Ross and Lighthizer demanding a more thorough investigation of the steel issue, with more input from those affected. The lawmakers complained of canceled briefings with Congress and asked Trump administration officials to \u201cimmediately brief committee staff on these matters and respond to all member requests for individual briefings\u201d before making a decision.\u201cWe have no idea what they\u2019re doing,\u201d Ms. McCaskill said.Not all lawmakers are worried about steel tariffs, and some believe a serious, carefully crafted move may be necessary as a first step to global efforts to get China to decrease its steel production, which U.S. producers blame for weighing on global prices.\u201cThere very much needs to be a global addressing of the steel issue, and maybe Section 232 will bring this about,\u201d said Rep.       Sander Levin       (D., Mich.), who is often a critic of the Trump administration.But some lawmakers say they want exclusions for the U.K., Canada or other countries who are military allies. Some people following the case expect Canada and Mexico could be granted exclusions as the Trump administration prepares for a renegotiation of the North American Trade Agreement, or Nafta.Canadian Prime Minister       Justin Trudeau       told his country\u2019s lawmakers\u00a0on Wednesday\u00a0that he spoke with President Trump on why Canada should be exempted from any curbs on steel imports his administration may implement.\u2014Paul Vieira in Ottawa contributed to this article.Write to William Mauldin at william.mauldin@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-23 05:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trumps-steel-tariff-threat-faces-resistance-from-lawmakers-1498210202", "news_title": "Trump\u2019s Steel Tariff Threat Faces Resistance From Lawmakers ", "keywords": "steel imports,steel tariffs,trump steel tariffs,trump trade,u.s. trade,u.s. trade policy,Robert Lighthizer,Wilbur Ross,trade,external payments,physical trade,economic news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,commodity markets,metals markets,commodity,financial market news,lead markets,non-ferrous metals markets,primary metals,iron,steel,ferroalloys,basic materials,resources,steel production"}, {"content": "NEW DELHI\u2014India is going up against China in a new Asian space race, trying to tighten its control of regional skies and alliances by leveraging its ability to send satellites into orbit inexpensively.In recent rounds of space diplomacy, China offered to build telecommunications satellites for Sri Lanka, Afghanistan and Nepal. In May, India went a step further, launching its \u201cSouth Asia Satellite,\u201d which those three countries can use at no cost.At stake in the contest is regional leadership, as India has the opportunity to be the power that helps its neighbors develop their own space ambitions, steering them away from Beijing\u2019s influence.Next year, India plans to activate its version of the Global Positioning System, which it has also offered to share with its neighbors. Meanwhile, China is expanding a rival fleet of navigation satellites that will be over four times the size of India\u2019s to cover the countries along its \u201cOne Belt, One Road\u201d infrastructure corridors by 2018.Last year, India started construction on a satellite ground station in Vietnam, to complement others in Brunei, Indonesia, and Mauritius. The deal riled China. State media said the facility could be employed for military purposes to monitor the South China Sea.In the next five years, India plans to spend over $6 billion on its space program and send 25 rockets into space, three times the budget and number of rockets as a decade ago. China sent almost the same number of rockets into space last year alone and doesn\u2019t disclose its space budget.The U.S. space budget of almost $40 billion a year is more than six times China\u2019s assumed budget, according to the most-recent figures from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. China has overtaken Russia and is just behind the European Union in spending, and last year launched more rockets than Russia for the first time.Beijing is also on track to open its Tiangong-3 space station in 2022, which it is offering to open to other countries. The international space station is expected to close around then.In addition, China outpaces India in sophistication. This month it successfully tested a quantum satellite, sending light particles over distances that even the U.S. and Europe have yet to achieve.

As a group, U.S. households\u2019 debt-to-income and debt-to-asset ratios in the first quarter fell to their lowest levels since the early 2000s. A prolonged period of low rates have made that debt easier to bear: The Federal Reserve this week reported that households\u2019 overall debt-service ratio\u2014the share of after-tax income going toward debt payments\u2014are near historic lows.But Americans face financial obligations beyond debt payments, such as rents and auto leases, and these are taking a bigger bite out of pay. Indeed, the Fed report shows the share of income going toward non-debt financial obligations is sitting near its highest level since the 1980s. It is a development that particularly for households at lower income levels may be crimping spending.Commerce Department figures show the homeownership rate fell to its lowest levels in over a half-century in the years since the financial crisis, and it doesn\u2019t look likely to recover anytime soon. That has tightened the supply of rental units, pushing rents up 18% over the past five years, according to the Labor Department, even as inflation away from housing has been nearly nonexistent.So while many people who own their homes have benefited from rock-bottom mortgage rates, renters\u2019 monthly nut has risen. Those renters tend to be poorer: The Fed\u2019s most recent survey of consumer finances, conducted in 2013, showed the median annual income of families that rented was $27,800 versus $63,400 for families that owned.More people are leasing cars rather than taking out loans to buy them, leaving them with lower debt but still putting them on the hook for monthly payments. In May, 31.2% of new vehicles booked as sold by auto makers were financed via lease agreements versus 20.6% five years earlier, according to J.D. Power. Nor are leased cars merely the purview of the well-off: About a quarter of new car sales going to subprime and deep subprime borrowers are leased.Then there are the payments that aren\u2019t included in the Fed\u2019s data on financial obligations, but that consumers are nevertheless obliged to pay. Mobile phone and internet plans, for example, have moved to the essential spending bucket for most households, and they come with a monthly bill. The Labor Department estimates that spending on information and information processing services\u2014a category that includes mobile telephone, landline telephone and internet services\u2014now counts for 3.2% of the average consumer\u2019s spending versus 2.3% in 2000.For richer Americans who are benefiting from lower mortgage rates, buoyant incomes and rising asset prices, the rise in non-debt payments counts as an afterthought.

But Beijing\u2019s abrupt regulatory sweep against some of the nation\u2019s largest overseas deal makers on Thursday underscores the biggest, long-lasting risk in investing in China: policy uncertainties.The markets\u2019 response to the unexpected regulatory clampdown also serves as a reminder of how fragile Chinese investors are in the face of Beijing\u2019s seemingly strong resolve to clean up a debt-laden financial system after years of widely available credit.The Shanghai Composite Index rose 0.5% to its highest level in a week and a half on Wednesday after MSCI announced its decision to include 222 domestically listed Chinese stocks in its emerging-markets index.The opposite happened less than 24 hours later, when news broke that China\u2019s banking regulator is conducting a sweeping check on the borrowing of some of the country\u2019s top overseas deal makers in one of the most forceful attempts yet to get a grip on debt.The list covers some of the highest-flying private conglomerates in China, including Anbang Insurance Group Co., whose chairman, Wu Xiaohui has been detained by investigators of economic crimes; HNA Group Co.;             Fosun International Ltd.      ; and property giant Dalian Wanda Group, owned by billionaire       Wang Jianlin.Little-known Rossoneri Sports Investment Management Changxing Ltd., which made headlines with its acquisition this year of Italian soccer powerhouse AC Milan, is also on the list.The five are famed for bold international bets on big brand names, opaque structures and a dizzying amount of deal making. They accounted for $387 billion in overseas investment since the beginning of 2015, 16% of Chinese companies\u2019 total, according to Dealogic.The revelations triggered heavy selloffs in bonds and stocks related to some of these companies.Shenzhen-listed shares of Wanda Film Co., the entertainment unit of Wanda Group, plunged nearly 10% before the company requested suspending share trading. Bonds issued by one of Wanda\u2019s property units fell 2.5% amid chatter that several banks were dumping their holdings. Hong Kong-listed HNA Holding Group Co., a unit of HNA Group, fell 6%, while Fosun International closed down 5.8%.The broader market also tanked. The Shanghai index erased earlier gains and closed down 0.3%, while its more-active Shenzhen counterpart lost 1.3%.While their individual stocks rebounded after Wanda and Fosun each issued statements overnight claiming their operations remain normal, investors look far from convinced in general.\u201cDoubts and confusion linger on among investors, and it shows again that policy risk is the biggest risk in this market,\u201d said Amy Lin, senior analyst at             Capital Securities.While some of the companies in question have made relevant comments, \u201cit\u2019d be best for the banking regulator itself to come out to clarify,\u201d Ms. Lin said.The China Banking Regulatory Commission has remained silent.A similar episode occurred in mid-April when The Wall Street Journal reported that the regulatory commission had launched a crackdown on Chinese banks\u2019 risky lending and investment practices. Among them are so-called wealth-management products, which are deposit-like financial products offering much higher returns.Both the Shanghai and Shenzhen markets fell over 1% during that week, while the Chinese bond market entered a downward spiral that saw prices hit a 29-month low less than four weeks after that.While the investigation into the five companies\u2019 offshore borrowing is theoretically part of the same campaign by the authorities to prevent financial risk, the timing came as a surprise, said Tim Condon, economist at ING in Singapore.\u201cThere is an element of capriciousness in the regulatory regime when these kinds of things happen, although people investing in China are aware that the system of regulation is a work in progress,\u201d Mr. Condon added.Some investors indeed view the financial housecleaning as an overdue, positive development.\u201cAt least they are doing it now rather than after a crisis,\u201d said Sean Darby, chief global equity strategist at Jefferies in Hong Kong. \u201cThe authorities have made it known they are going to start cracking down on leverage. This is going to be a risk for some parts of the equities market for some time.\u201dThe tricky question is how Beijing juggles the long-term system risk and the short-term effect its clampdown will have on markets. And there are signs that the authorities have been taking a relatively flexible or opportunistic approach.In the past few months, the authorities have chosen to roll out new restrictions when markets were doing well, while using state media to send soothing messages when they aren\u2019t, according to Qin Han, chief fixed-income analyst at Guotai Junan Securities.\u201cConfucianism preaches the importance of peace, and a harmonious society is the ultimate goal,\u201d Mr. Qin said.But to others, no matter how much economic sense the regulatory crackdown makes, it shouldn\u2019t come at the expense of free markets.\u201cIn a genuine market economy, whether a company\u2019s leverage is too high should be determined by investors, not regulators,\u201d said Capital Securities\u2019 Ms. Lin.\u2014Steven Russolillo in Hong Kong contributed to this article.", "news_time": "2017-06-23 05:04:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/wild-week-for-chinese-stocks-reminds-investors-of-beijings-heavy-hand-1498208678", "news_title": "Wild Week for Chinese Stocks Reminds Investors of Beijing\u2019s Heavy Hand", "keywords": " chinese regulators, chinese stocks, market volatility,shanghai composite index,stock markets,MSCI,regulation,government policy,ownership changes,acquisitions,mergers,divestments,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,equity markets,commodity,financial market news,printing,publishing,database,directory publishing,media,entertainment"}, {"content": "FRANKFURT\u2014The European Central Bank lodged a formal request for greater powers to supervise euro-denominated clearing, stepping up a tug of war between European Union authorities and Britain over the future of the lucrative business line after Brexit.Britain\u2019s departure from the EU has rekindled a debate about whether big U.K.-based clearing houses should decamp within the bloc, given the importance of their activities for the stability of eurozone financial markets.The ECB said on Friday it had lodged a request with EU authorities for changes to its statute that would allow it to exercise \u201ca clear legal competence in the area of central clearing.\u201dThe move, a year after the Brexit vote, underlines the ECB\u2019s eagerness to supervise a vast and lucrative business centered beyond the eurozone\u2019s borders.London-based clearinghouses, such as the             London Stock Exchange\u2019s       LCH.Clearnet, clear around 90% of the euro-denominated interest rate swaps of euro area banks, and 40% of their euro-denominated credit default swaps, according to ECB estimates.Those figures \u201cshould give you a sense of how relevant these [clearinghouses] are for the stability of the euro,\u201d\u00a0      Beno\u00eet Coeur\u00e9,        who sits on the ECB\u2019s six-member executive board, said in a speech this week. He argued that Britain\u2019s departure from the EU made it \u201curgent\u201d to review current supervisory arrangements.The European Commission, the EU\u2019s executive arm, proposed a plan\u00a0last week that would force parts of London\u2019s clearing business\u00a0to relocate within the EU.Mr. Coeur\u00e9 welcomed those plans as \u201ca step in the right direction.\u201d\u201cWe certainly need to play a strong role here,\u201d he said.\u00a0The current regime \u201crelies to a large extent on local supervision, and provides EU authorities with very limited tools for obtaining information and taking action in the event of a crisis.\u201dThe ECB has long pushed for a greater role in overseeing euro-denominated trades. It lost a legal battle over the issue two years ago in the EU\u2019s second-highest court, but Britain\u2019s departure from the EU has lent fresh impetus to its efforts.The ECB\u2019s proposed amendments to its statutes would allow it \u201cto monitor and address risks associated with central clearing activities that could affect the conduct of monetary policy, the operation of payment systems and the stability of the euro,\u201d the central bank said.Still, Britain is expected to push back hard during the Brexit negotiations, which kicked off this week in Brussels.Responding to the EU\u2019s proposals,\u00a0      Mark Carney,        governor of the Bank of England,\u00a0warned this week against fragmenting Europe\u2019s clearing market.\u201cFragmentation is in no one\u2019s economic interest,\u201d Mr. Carney said. \u201cNor is it necessary for financial stability. Indeed it can damage it.\u201dBut it is unclear how receptive the EU\u2019s 27 other members will be to such arguments.Speaking on the sidelines of a gathering of EU leaders in Brussels on Friday, Austrian Chancellor       Christian Kern       argued it was sensible to give the ECB greater powers over clearing given its successful efforts to support the eurozone during the bloc\u2019s recent crisis.\u201cThe ECB has done a great job, an amazing job\u2014      Mario Draghi       has saved Europe,\u201d Mr. Kern said, referring to the bank\u2019s president. \u201cTherefore, it makes sense to give them more means to do their job.\u201d\u2014Paul Hannon in London and Emre Peker in Brussels contributed to this article.Write to Tom Fairless at tom.fairless@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-23 04:49:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-k-s-euro-clearing-business-at-risk-as-ecb-requests-more-powers-1498207178", "news_title": "U.K.\u2019s Euro Clearing Business at Risk as ECB Requests More Powers ", "keywords": " brexit,ecb, euro clearing, eurozone regulation, eurozone rules,European Central Bank,European Union,euro zone,currency,economic news,political,general news,international relations,politics,domestic politics,banking,central banking,credit types,services,clearing house,reserve activities,credit,financial services"}, {"content": "One year on from the Brexit vote, discerning the U.K.\u2019s future outside the European Union is still difficult.Markets, however, distilled things into a more straightforward proposition: for much of the past year, Brexit has been bad for sterling but good for the benchmark FTSE 100 stock index. That might be changing.Sterling has been the key barometer of the U.K.\u2019s fortunes. The more disruptive the prospect of Brexit appeared to be, the more the pound fell. But that was good news for the FTSE 100, home to large multinational companies whose foreign earnings are inflated by a weaker pound. Just 26% of their revenues come from the U.K.,             BNP Paribas                   notes.Sterling and stocks, which were uncorrelated before the vote, became negatively correlated. Sterling has made a big difference to returns: in local-currency terms the FTSE100 is up 17% since the vote; in dollar terms it is little changed.But things might not be so simple now. Sterling is up 3% against the dollar this year. The last week has seen new underpinning emerge for the currency with a surprising shift toward tighter monetary policy from a number of Bank of England rate-setting officials. Uncertainty around Brexit means sterling faces challenges in marching higher from here, but the currency tailwind for the FTSE 100 has faded.And it is the economies on the other side of the negotiations that are now on the march. Eurozone stocks have fared better this year as political risks on the Continent have declined and growth has accelerated. International investors may bypass the U.K. if they are coming to Europe. The U.K. economy faces a wage squeeze and the reality of Brexit may yet lead to disruption for companies.The clock is now ticking on the Brexit talks, and the hard yards lie ahead. For U.K. stocks and sterling, it may not be such a simple equation.Write to Richard Barley at richard.barley@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-23 04:45:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/brexit-one-year-later-markets-might-get-it-wrong-again-1498207558", "news_title": "Brexit One Year Later: Markets Might Get It Wrong Again ", "keywords": "brexit,brexit inset,heard on the street,sterling,uk markets,European Union,political,general news,international relations,politics,domestic politics,equity markets,commodity,financial market news"}, {"content": "MOSCOW\u2014Russian armed forces launched a cruise-missile attack on Islamic State targets in Syria\u2019s Hama province, the defense ministry said Friday.The defense ministry statement said the Kalibr cruise missiles struck infrastructure used to store weapons and ammunition for militants coming from Raqqa, where the U.S. seeks to squeeze the group out of the urban stronghold.Russia said it had been monitoring Islamic State militants escaping from Raqqa to the south over the past week.

Nothing dramatic can happen before that, right?Wrong. The winter of 2016 and spring of 2017 have already proven to be among the most volatile in memory\u2014particularly in the bond market where yields shot higher, but also in stocks, which felt the heat from the broad regulatory crackdown on debt in April and May. The latest victims are China\u2019s highflying overseas deal makers Anbang, HNA, Fosun and Wanda, whose widespread borrowing throughout China\u2019s banking sector are now under investigation.As early as January, it was clear that the improving economic\u2014and particularly employment\u2014picture in China could give policy makers a window to deal with mushrooming financial-sector risks before the Party Congress in the fall made big political moves too risky.That window, however, is about to close.Although China\u2019s economy remains in reasonable shape for now, April and May data contained clear signals that growth has already peaked cyclically. And slowing industrial profit growth, which fell to 14% year over year in April from nearly 24% in March, will start to put pressure on the job market as well\u2014-the key to political stability that the Communist Party prizes above all else as the Party Congress approaches.Although some independent surveys paint a brighter picture, China\u2019s official purchasing managers indexes show the job market moving back into contraction in recent months: nonmanufacturing, which includes construction, peaked in November while manufacturing peaked in March. Tightening financial conditions could accelerate this trend\u2014after falling continuously since late 2015, real borrowing costs for Chinese firms probably started rising again in the second quarter. Chinese factory gate inflation peaked in March\u2014the same time as industrial profits.The early warning signs of a slowdown in the economy, and particularly the labor market, means that the pressure from President       Xi Jinping       and other top cadres to keep raising the heat on financial-sector leverage will probably start easing soon.That may be easier said than done, however.Regulatory crackdowns can take on a life of their own\u2014part of the reason that the volatility in April was so intense, as different regulators all competed to show the top leadership they were heeding Mr. Xi\u2019s direct call to tackle financial risks. The 2015 stock crash, which was triggered in part by regulators\u2019 belated crackdown on margin borrowing, was a classic example of the danger of too little action, taken too late.Chinese regulators may yet succeed in tamping down just enough on leverage, at just the right time, to postpone a debt reckoning once again. But that is a tricky needle to thread\u2014and the consequences of failure large indeed.Write to Nathaniel Taplin at nathaniel.taplin@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-23 03:53:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-debt-crackdown-could-get-out-of-hand-1498204384", "news_title": "China\u2019s Debt Crackdown Could Get Out of Hand", "keywords": "china communist party, china communist party 19th party congress,china communist party congress 2017,china crackdown,china debt crackdown,china markets,regulation,government policy,corporate,industrial news,government finance,government borrowing,economic news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,commodity,financial market news"}, {"content": "SEOUL, South Korea\u2014A South Korean court on Friday sentenced a longtime friend of ousted president Park Geun-hye to three years in prison for using her ties to the chief executive to unlawfully get her daughter into a prestigious Seoul university.The Seoul Central District Court said the one-time presidential confidant       Choi Soon-sil       \u201ccommitted so many illegal activities\u201d as she pressured Ewha Womans University to grant admission and then provide academic favors to her daughter Chung Yoo-ra, despite Ms. Chung\u2019s questionable qualifications.Ms. Choi, Ms. Park\u2019s friend of 40 years, is being tried separately over more serious charges, including allegations that she colluded with Ms. Park to take tens of millions of dollars from the country\u2019s largest companies in bribes and through extortion.Following months of protests by millions and impeachment by lawmakers in December, Ms. Park was formally removed from office and arrested over the corruption scandal in March. She was indicted in April on bribery and other charges.Choi Kyung-hee,        Ewha\u2019s former president, and Namkung Gon, the university\u2019s former head of admissions, also received shorter prison terms on Friday for providing Ms. Chung with favorable treatment.Ms. Chung was extradited from Denmark last month and is currently being investigated by prosecutors who see her as a key figure in the suspected bribery connections between Ms. Park and corporate giant Samsung.According to prosecutors, Ms. Park colluded with Choi Soon-sil to take about $26 million in bribes from Samsung and was promised tens of millions of dollars more from Samsung and other large companies. Prosecutors say the bribery included $7 million Samsung provided to a sports consulting firm controlled by Choi that financed Chung\u2019s equestrian training in Germany.The allegations that Ms. Chung was sponsored by Samsung and received academic favors helped drive the popular anger that led to Ms. Park\u2019s ouster. Many students were among the millions who protested against Park for weeks, angry that Ms. Chung got a free pass into an elite school because of her wealth and connections, while others navigate the country\u2019s hypercompetitive school environment on their own.\u2014Copyright 2017 the Associated Press.", "news_time": "2017-06-23 01:51:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/first-prison-sentence-for-ousted-south-korean-presidents-friend-1498197116", "news_title": "First Prison Sentence for Ousted South Korean President\u2019s Friend", "keywords": " south korea courts,south korea politics, south korea president, south korea prison, south korea scandal,bribery,political,general news,corruption,crime,legal action,education,financial crime,university,college"}, {"content": "Britain\u2019s surprise vote to leave the European Union on June 23 last year shook financial markets, sending the pound down more than 11% against the dollar in a matter of hours and causing local shares to tumble.

But now a shaken power structure in Westminster and a central bank divided by economic cross currents have investors debating whether the beleaguered currency has further to fall.Last June, the U.K. voted to leave the European Union, and the pound tumbled 11% in a matter of hours.Since then, political uncertainty and concerns that leaving the EU will dent economic growth have continued to weigh down the pound. Despite rising slightly this year, it currently trades at around $1.27, compared with $1.50 before the referendum result.Many feel it has further to fall but are reluctant to place large bets given the uncertain political and central bank outlook in the U.K. Inconclusive elections earlier this month opened up the possibility of the U.K. maintaining closer-than-expected ties with the EU, but also fueled worries the prime minister will be seen as a less reliable interlocutor, increasing the chances the talks could end without a deal.Meanwhile, as the bulk of the developed world grapples with accelerating growth and signs of tepid inflation, the U.K. is experiencing inflationary pressures and signals of a slowdown in the economy.Weak growth and building inflation have made life complicated for Bank of England policy makers, who are increasingly at odds over whether to raise interest rates in response to higher inflation.\u201cI think the U.K. will face a headwind to growth later this year as Brexit concerns strangle things,\u201d said Alan Wilson, investment manager at             State Street                   Global Advisors.Investors say that politics, and specifically Brexit, will be the major driving force behind the pound\u2019s long-term path.The U.K. opting to maintain a close relationship with the EU could see sterling swing higher, they say. Some investors believe the recent election result has made that outcome more likely. The ruling Conservative Party, which had campaigned for a clean break with the EU, lost its majority in parliament and is now reliant on other parties to pass legislation.But Britain\u2019s two main political parties say they remain committed to Brexit. Many still think sterling will suffer as the Brexit negotiations move forward.\u201cSterling hasn\u2019t bottomed yet,\u201d said Marc Chandler, global head of currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman, predicting it could eventually fall to parity with the dollar. \u201cBrexit will make the U.K. smaller and weaker.\u201dOver the nearer term, the pound\u2019s trajectory will largely depend on how the Bank of England addresses the simultaneous rise in inflation and slowdown in economic growth.U.K. consumer prices climbed in May at the fastest annual rate in almost four years, with a weak pound leading to higher import prices.Economic growth held up well in the latter half of 2016, defying the dire predictions of many analysts. But growth slowed in the first quarter of the year on weak consumer spending. Some economists believe that could be a sign of things to come.Researchers at industry trade group Institute of International Finance forecast quarterly U.K. growth will slow to near zero this year as businesses put off investment decisions and consumers are hit by declines in real wages. Brexit negotiations are likely to be tough and uncertainty will remain high throughout, they argue.Inflation-targeting central banks typically raise interest rates to tamp down on price rises. Higher rates would typically boost the currency, as investors are encouraged to buy higher-yielding sterling-denominated assets.But the increase in U.K. consumer prices is mainly down to the weak currency boosting import prices rather than rising wages and an expanding economy. The BOE cut interest rates and boosted its bond-buying stimulus programs following the Brexit vote to support the economy, and policy makers are now wary of lifting rates in a way that could stifle growth.Communications from Bank of England officials reveal this conflict. The BOE\u2019s rate-setting monetary policy committee voted to hold rates steady at record lows last week. But three out of the eight-member committee voted for a rate rise, up from one person at the previous meeting.Andreas K\u00f6nig, head of foreign exchange in Europe for Pioneer Investments, says it is hard to find any reason to bet on the pound rising over the longer term due to the U.K.\u2019s economic position and the uncertainty over Brexit. But he is wary of betting on its decline given he thinks the BOE\u2019s recent comments show it will intervene verbally to prop up the currency.\u201cLower sterling makes sense fundamentally, but from a risk-reward perspective it\u2019s not very attractive,\u201d he said.Others are still betting on declines. Bearish bets against the pound have increased for a third week, according to CFTC Data, with net speculative positions on the currency remaining in negative territory at all times since the vote. Many believe the lack of clarity over the U.K.\u2019s relationship with the EU will continue to cloud the picture.\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to see sterling making significant gains until the political uncertainty here is cleared and we can see a clearer path to how Brexit negotiations will work themselves through,\u201d said Simon Derrick, chief currency strategist at BNY Mellon.Write to Riva Gold at riva.gold@wsj.com and Christopher Whittall at christopher.whittall@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-23 00:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/one-year-on-the-pound-cant-shake-brexit-blues-1498190402", "news_title": "One Year On, the Pound Can\u2019t Shake Brexit Blues ", "keywords": "brexit,inflation,pound,sterling,u.k. economic growth,Bank of England,European Union,economic performance,indicators,prices,economic news,political,general news,international relations,politics,domestic politics,money,currency markets,foreign exchange markets,commodity,financial market news"}]
