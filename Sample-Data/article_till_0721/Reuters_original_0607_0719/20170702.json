A pitch thrown behind Carlos Santana did the trick. Santana, Cleveland's first basemen, got plunked in the back by Detroit Tigers starter Jordan Zimmermann in the fifth inning. Santana yelled at Zimmermann before taking first base, but no one was ejected. The following inning, the Indians erupted in a constructive way. Jose Ramirez's two-run homer capped a four-run sixth inning and the Indians salvaged the second game of a day-night doubleheader with a 4-1 victory over the Detroit Tigers on Saturday night at Comerica Park. Three Detroit batters had been hit by pitches during the day before the pitch that whizzed behind Santana.  A couple of their guys got hit. I understand that. But I don't think you ever throw behind somebody,  Cleveland manager Terry Francona said.  Looking back, though, it might have been the best thing that happened to us because it woke us up and our guys really got after it from there. We played with a lot more energy.  Related CoverageCleveland Indians - PlayerWatchDetroit Tigers - PlayerWatchMichael Brantley and Edwin Encarnacion drove in the other runs for the American League Central-leading Indians (43-37). Carlos Carrasco (9-3) held the Tigers (36-44) to one run and four hits in seven innings. Carrasco bounced back from an outing in which he gave up eight earned runs in 3 1/3 innings against Texas on Monday. Andrew Miller posted his second save. Carrasco retired the last 10 batters he faced after hitting Tigers shortstop Jose Iglesias with a fourth-inning pitch.  I don't want to hit anyone. I just want to get a ground ball to get an out,  Carrasco said.  The game's 1-0 and a man on (second), I don't want to hit anyone. I was just trying to throw inside to get a ground ball and that hit him. After that, I started to pitch a little more aggressive.  Zimmermann (5-6) gave up four runs and five hits in 5 2/3 innings. He held Cleveland to one hit before the sixth.  That's the way it's been going for me,  Zimmermann said.  I've been pitching well and I'm just not getting the results.  Zimmermann said there was no intent on the pitch to Santana.  I got him out the first time up and in,  he said.  I was having a tough time all night going in on lefties. Everything kept running back, running back. I told myself 'Drive it in there.' I drove it in there and threw behind him.  I don't know what he was saying. I couldn't understand him. Obviously, he was upset and probably thought it was intentional, but it wasn't.  Mikie Mahtook had two hits and drove in Detroit's run. The Tigers won the opener 7-4, breaking a 4-4 tie with three runs in the seventh inning. Nicholas Castellanos had three hits, including a go-ahead triple in the seventh, and J.D. Martinez and Miguel Cabrera hit back-to-back homers for Detroit. Shane Greene (2-2) got one out and the victory and Justin Wilson notched his eighth save. Losing pitcher Bryan Shaw (2-3) allowed three runs and three hits in two-thirds of an inning. Roberto Perez led off Cleveland's big sixth inning in the nightcap with a single and Jason Kipnis followed with a double. Brantley's RBI groundout brought in the first run and Encarnacion's bloop single knocked in the second run. Ramirez then crushed the next offering into the right field stands, making it 4-1 and ending Zimmermann's night. The Tigers grabbed the early lead in the second inning. Castellanos led off with a double and one out later Mahtook brought him home. Mahtook checked his swing and he made enough contact to bloop the ball over second baseman Jason Kipnis for a single. NOTES: Detroit LF Justin Upton missed both games of the doubleheader because of right side soreness. Upton was a late scratch in the opener after feeling discomfort in the batting cage. Upton leads the club in homers (15) and RBIs (52). ... The Tigers haven't swept a doubleheader from the Indians since Aug. 7, 1986. ... Cleveland is 36-10 when scoring four or more runs. ...

The Philadelphia Phillies might want to acquire him just so he stops using them as a one-man bobblehead doll cottage industry. Cabrera celebrated his bobblehead doll day in style Saturday afternoon, when he hit the go-ahead two-run homer in the seventh inning to lift the Mets to a 7-6 win over the Phillies at Citi Field. Cabrera's homer Saturday wasn't quite as dramatic as the one that was recreated on Saturday's giveaway -- a walk-off, bat-flipping blast he hit against the Phillies on Sept. 22. The bobbleheaded Cabrera is pictured raising his arms upright and far apart while the bat lays next to him.  I think the bobblehead looks better,  Cabrera said with a grin. If Cabrera's two-out shot to right off Pat Neshek doesn't become a bobblehead, it'll at least make the social media rounds Saturday night. Cabrera held his bat aloft for a couple seconds while watching the ball, which landed on one of the dugout roofs in right-center field. He made the sign of the cross upon touching home plate before emphatically slapping his hands together. The homer capped a wild seventh inning in which seven runs were scored by the two teams -- the Phillies took the lead in the top half on a three-run homer by Tommy Joseph -- and gave the Mets (38-42) more reason to believe they can make an unlikely surge into postseason contention. New York has won four straight and seven out of eight to move within 8 1/2 games of the first-place Washington Nationals in the National League East. Related CoveragePreview: Phillies at MetsPhiladelphia Phillies - PlayerWatchNew York Mets - PlayerWatch These are the games when you've got to say to yourself, look, we're not out of it,  Mets manager Terry Collins said. Nor does it look as if Cabrera will be heading out of town anytime soon. Cabrera asked for a trade on June 23 upon learning that he'd play second base instead of his usual shortstop. General manager Sandy Alderson has said numerous times that the July trade market isn't developing yet. And even if it was, Cabrera is turning himself into an even more valuable piece for the Mets by hitting .394 (13-for-33) with five multi-hit games -- including a 2-for-4 effort Saturday -- since the position change.  'Cabby' understood the whole dynamics of everything,  Collins said.  I knew when he got out there that he'd settle in and play very, very well. I tell you, if we get him hot, we're going to have a good finish.  Cabrera has been reluctant to discuss his trade demand or his feelings about the position change since his initial comments on June 23.  I just come every day to get better,  Cabrera said.  I do my best to help the team.  The homer by Cabrera came just 12 minutes before heavy rains began and umpires waved the players off the field with two outs and a runner on in the top of the eighth. Following a delay of 57 minutes, Addison Reed entered and struck out Freddy Galvis before finishing off his 14th save by working around a leadoff double in the ninth by Aaron Altherr, who was stranded at third. Fernando Salas (1-2) tossed two innings and earned the win despite giving up Joseph's tie-breaking homer. Jose Reyes opened the Mets' scoring with an RBI double in the second. Jay Bruce had an RBI groundout immediately before Lucas Duda homered in the fourth. T.J. Rivera led off the seventh with a homer off Phillies starter Jeremy Hellickson. Neshek (2-2) took the loss after giving up three runs on three hits -- including an RBI single to pinch-hitter Wilmer Flores, two batters before Cabrera homered -- while striking out one over two-thirds of an inning.  Every night there's going to be a winner and a loser, pitching (and) at the plate, and today wasn't me,  Neshek said. Entering Saturday, Neshek had surrendered just two runs in his first 31 2/3 innings this season.  What a shame,  Phillies manager Pete Mackanin said.  Neshek has been just about unhittable the whole season.  Joseph also had an RBI double in the fifth for the Phillies (26-53), who plated their first two runs in the fourth when Joseph and Nick Williams scored after Mets starter Zack Wheeler dropped a relay throw at first on a potential inning-ending double play grounder by Ty Kelly. Wheeler, who was activated from the disabled list prior to the game, gave up two unearned runs on two hits and two walks while striking out four over 3 2/3 innings. Hellickson allowed four runs on seven hits and two walks while striking out four over 6 1/3 innings. NOTES: To make room for RHP Zack Wheeler on the 25-man roster, the Mets placed OF Michael Conforto (left hand bone bruise) on the 10-day disabled list, retroactive to June 28. ... The fourth-inning homer by Mets 1B Lucas Duda was the 122nd of his career, tying him for eighth on the team's all-time list with former OF Kevin McReynolds. ...

As result of a legalization measure approved by Nevada voters in November, the state will join four other U.S. states and the District of Columbia in allowing recreational sales. Authorized marijuana shops will be able to sell up to one ounce (28 grams) for recreational use by customers 21 years and older, said Stephanie Klapstein, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Taxation.    Public consumption of marijuana is prohibited, and Nevada has enacted new regulations against edible forms of pot that could appeal to children, such as fruit-shaped candies infused with cannabis. Nevada is also imposing a 10 percent excise tax on pot sales in addition to the regular 4.6 percent state sales tax.  Nevada has yet to finalize the exact number of stores that regulators will approve. Sixty applications were submitted from across the state, according to Klapstein, whose department is overseeing the state's pot market. Only medical cannabis dispensaries, which became legal in the state in 2015, are eligible to apply for licenses for recreational sales.

Voters in three other states - California, Maine and Massachusetts - have also approved marijuana legalization. In 2012, Washington and Colorado were the first states to legalize recreational marijuana, followed by Oregon and Alaska.  Marijuana remains illegal under federal law. Most U.S. states allow it for medical purposes, but not for recreation.  A U.S. Department of Justice spokesman in an email declined to comment on Nevada's state-sanctioned marijuana sales and added that the department is reviewing its policies on marijuana enforcement.

Jonathan Schoop hit his 16th home run for Baltimore. Rays right-hander Jake Odorizzi (5-3) was charged with three runs and five hits with three strikeouts and two walks in five innings (111 pitches). He has allowed at least three earned runs in six straight starts and given up a home run in his past 13 outings.  We made him throw a lot of pitches,  Orioles first baseman Trey Mancini said.  I think he ended up with five innings, and over 100 pitches, so we did a good job of getting on base. Just couldn't capitalize on some of those situations.  The Rays took a 3-0 lead off Dylan Bundy (8-7) in the first when Mallex Smith scored from first on a single by Evan Longoria and Morrison followed with a homer. Baltimore cut the lead to 3-1 on a two-out RBI single by Craig Gentry. Tampa Bay responded in the third with solo homers by Morrison and Souza, the 11th time the Rays have hit back-to-back home runs this season. Bundy was pitching on six days' rest and made back-to-back starts against Tampa Bay. The time off did not help him as he labored through just four innings, allowing five runs and seven hits with seven strikeouts. It was the shortest start of the season for Bundy, who has given up a home run in 11 straight games.  Yeah, long ball got me in trouble today, obviously,  Bundy said.  I mean, just pitches right down the middle or pitches that were up in the zone and they were able to hammer today, so, tough game plan. They came out swinging the bats early and tried to manage it, but wasn't able to today.  Ramos' three-run shot off Alec Asher provided an 8-1 lead in the fifth. After Schoop's two-run homer cut into the margin, the Rays answered with two more runs in the sixth on a throwing error by right fielder Gentry and a double by Corey Dickerson.

Or even hit. Or a walk. It was a wild pitch. Denard Span scored on a wild pitch in the 11th inning Saturday as the Giants won their fifth game in a row with a 2-1 victory over Pittsburgh at PNC Park.  You take it,  Giants manager Bruce Bochy said.  I mean, wild pitch, both teams are having a hard time.  Span walked with one out. He advanced to second on a passed ball and to third on Joe Panik's single to left. After Hunter Pence struck out, reliever Daniel Hudson (1-4) walked Buster Posey, but the fourth ball was wild and Span raced home.  I did my best. I missed. It happens. It's the game,  Pirates rookie catcher Elias Diaz said of the wild pitch. When the ball flipped toward the backstop, Hudson crouched and held his head in his hands.  If I was going to get beat there, I was going to get beat by the best pitch,  said Hudson, Pittsburgh's fifth pitcher.  (Against) a right-hander this year, that's my slider. I was just trying to make a quality pitch. If I walk him, I walk him. I just got a little bit too much bite on it and got a bad kick.  Related CoveragePreview: Giants at PiratesSan Francisco Giants - PlayerWatchPittsburgh Pirates - PlayerWatchThe fifth straight win matches the season high for the Giants (32-51). Pittsburgh (37-44) reached the halfway point of season with a two-game losing streak. Josh Osich (2-1) picked up the win after pitching a scoreless 10th inning. Sam Dyson worked the 11th for his first save. San Francisco starter Matt Moore has been inconsistent all season, but had one of his better outings, if a little on the short side. He allowed one run on four hits over 5 2/3 innings, with five strikeouts and six walks in the no-decision.  Pitching with runners on base, a lot of runners on base all day,  said Moore, who is 1-4 in his past eight starts.  I think I had one clean inning (the fifth) in there.  But as the game went on, I think I settled in with just a little bit more of my mechanics.  Pittsburgh starter Chad Kuhl, facing San Francisco for the first time, no-hit the Giants through five innings. He gave up one run, a homer by Austin Slater, on two hits, with three strikeouts and one walk over six innings. It was the first time since April 18 that Kuhl lasted more than five innings.  He knows what the situation is,  Pirates manager Clint Hurdle said of Kuhl.  He wants to pitch deeper into games. He put himself in a situation to do that today.  Kuhl needed medical attention on the mound when the game's first batter, Span, hit a chopper that hit the right-hander in the left wrist area, above the glove. However, Kuhl was able to stay in the game. With two outs in the bottom of the first, Moore walked the bases loaded and got a visit from pitching coach Dave Righetti before he got Diaz to ground back to the mound. The Pirates took a 1-0 lead in the third. With two outs, Andrew McCutchen slapped a double to the left-field corner. After David Freese walked, Josh Bell's single to right scored McCutchen. San Francisco not only broke up Kuhl's no-hit bid in the sixth but also tied it. Slater led off with his third homer, a shot that just cleared the wall and McCutchen's glove in center to make it 1-1.  He's pretty strong. He gets carry on the ball. I think (his bat) has paint on it from scraping the wall as it went over,  Bochy said, even though that part of the wall is padded.  That was huge.  Pittsburgh had a chance to win it in the ninth. With two outs, reliever Hunter Strickland walked the bases loaded before striking out Diaz.  Things weren't really going my way for a little bit,  Strickland said. Those three runners were among the 15 Pittsburgh stranded as the Pirates had seven hits and 10 walks.  That's one of those games,  Bochy said.  We were fortunate. We know it. We were dodging bullets all game.  NOTES: San Francisco 3B Ryder Jones got hit by a pitch in the left wrist area in the 10th inning.

Using the podium again to lash out at the news media, Trump worked to energize evangelicals in his political base, noting that the U.S. currency was inscribed with the words: “In God We Trust.   Since the signing of the Declaration of Independence 241 years ago, America always affirmed that liberty comes from our creator. Our rights are given to us by God, and no earthly force can ever take those rights away,  he said. Attendees at the event for veterans waved miniature American flags from their seats in the theater and raised their hands as a sign of praise while a large choir sang ahead of Trump's remarks. The president praised veterans from each of the U.S. military branches and highlighted his administration's work to reform veterans' services. Trump, who is spending a long weekend at his property in Bedminster, New Jersey, flew back to Washington for the rally but did not spend the night at the White House, preferring to return to Bedminster. Trump has held campaign-like rallies regularly during his first few months in the White House and kicked off his own re-election campaign far earlier than other incumbents in recent history. Part of his strategy to connect with his supporters has included criticizing the media, and he included harsh words for the press again in his remarks.  The fake media is trying to silence us, but we will not let them,  he said.  The fake media tried to stop us from going to the White House. But I'm president, and they're not.

Swanson hit a tiebreaking RBI double in the seventh inning and another one in the ninth inning, leading the Braves to a 4-3 victory against the Oakland Athletics at the Oakland Coliseum.  Just a learning curve and trying to get where I need to be personally, mentally,  said Swanson, who was drafted No. 1 overall by Arizona in 2015.  Just trying to become the best version of myself every day. Taking the positives and moving forward with those and taking the negatives and learning from them again. Ups and downs. This game's hard. Just trying to learn each day and become better.  Swanson was batting .185 at the end of May, but he's raised his batting average to .229. He hit .296 in June. Batting ninth in the order on Saturday, he went 2-for-4 with two RBIs and had his 12th multi-hit game of the season.  He had a really good June,  Braves manager Brian Snitker said.  I know he and (hitting coach Kevin Seitzer) have been working, and he made some adjustments. He keeps working and he keeps his head and believes in himself. He has confidence in his abilities and we're seeing it.  Braves knuckleballer R.A. Dickey allowed one run over six innings in a no-decision. Dickey struck out four and walked three. He has allowed a combined two runs over 20 innings over his past three starts, going 2-0.  I had a good enough knuckleball where I was getting a lot of weak contact,  Dickey said.  Even the inning they scored their run, it was little nubber up the middle, a ground ball to the right side, a bleeder to left. So that's kind of how I gauge how the knuckleball was, how well they were squaring it up. They only really squared up a couple.  Related CoveragePreview: Braves at AthleticsAtlanta Braves - PlayerWatchOakland Athletics - PlayerWatchA's right-hander Paul Blackburn received a no-decision despite allowing one unearned run on three hits over six innings in his major-league debut. Blackburn, who was called up Saturday from Triple-A Nashville, struck out four, walked one and threw 96 pitches. He pitched in front of a large contingent of family members and friends from his hometown of Brentwood, some 45 miles northeast of Oakland.  Honestly, this is probably one of the best days of my life,  Blackburn said.  I'm just trying to take it all in. I'm not really sure it's me yet, but it was a lot of fun.  Blackburn made a strong impression on A's manager Bob Melvin.  I thought his composure was great,  Melvin said.  From the very start you worry about nerves a little bit, but it didn't seem like there were any.  The Braves have won the first two contests of the three-game interleague series and will go for the sweep Sunday afternoon. Atlanta took a 2-1 lead in the seventh when Danny Santana, the No. 8 hitter, blooped a one-out single, stole second and third and scored on Swanson's double. The Braves increased their lead to 3-1 in the eighth. Nick Markakis hit a leadoff double and scored with one out from third on Matt Adams' sacrifice fly. But the A's pulled even with two runs in the bottom of the eighth. After reliever Arodys Vizcaino walked Jed Lowrie, Khris Davis crushed his next pitch 458 feet off a window in a luxury suite far beyond and above the fence in left-center field. Davis' homer was his team-high 22nd of the season. The Braves moved ahead 4-3 in the ninth with an unearned run. A's rookie shortstop Franklin Barreto booted Santana's ground ball with one out for his second error of the game. Santana stole second and scored on Swanson's double down the left field line off Santiago Casilla (1-3). Jim Johnson, a former Athletic, pitched a perfect ninth with two strikeouts for his 18th save of the season and second straight against Oakland.  I think it just kind of shows what this team is about,  Swanson said of the ninth-inning rally.  We just keep going at it and going at it.  Santana went 2-for-4 with a double and an RBI, stole three bases and scored twice. Ryon Healy went 3-for-3 with a walk and an RBI for the A's. The Braves took a 1-0 lead in the second inning, scoring an unearned run off Blackburn. Tyler Flowers led off with a ground ball to Barreto, who airmailed his throw to first for a two-base error. Flowers scored on Santana's one-out double. Oakland pulled even with a run in the fourth off Dickey. Davis walked with one out, moved to second on Yonder Alonso's bloop single to left and scored when Healy grounded a sharp single to center. Matt Olson grounded a single to right, loading the bases, but Dickey got Josh Phegley to ground into a double play.

Koehler allowed seven runs -- all of them coming in the second inning -- as the Marlins fell to the Milwaukee Brewers 8-4 on Saturday afternoon at Miller Park.  The results were terrible but I felt closer to myself than I did,  said Koehler, who hadn't started a big league game since May 16, when he allowed eight runs over three innings to the Astros.  It's a really odd thing to say after a game like that. But there's still work that needs to be done. You've got to be able to put guys away.  It's just tough. You want to come back and set the tone and have a quality outing right away and put the team in a position to win the game, and when you don't do that it's very frustrating.  After his offense staked him to an early 2-0 lead on Justin Bour's two-run double, Koehler needed just nine pitches to get through the first inning but needed 50 to go through the second. Related CoveragePreview: Marlins at BrewersMiami Marlins - PlayerWatchMilwaukee Brewers - PlayerWatchKoehler got off to a bad start by walking leadoff batter Travis Shaw in the second. Domingo Santana followed and ripped an 0-2 offering to the wall in right that grazed the edge of Giancarlo Stanton's glove and dropped into a picnic area for his 14th home run of the season, tying -- and possibly changing the course -- of the game.  If I catch it the game is completely different, and we can probably have a chance to win that game,  Stanton said. It was all downhill for Koehler from there. Stephen Vogt followed with a single and Keon Broxton struck out for the first out of the inning. Orlando Arcia was up next and he reached on a base hit to left. A botched pickoff attempt let both runners advance to second and third, respectively, and Vogt put the Brewers ahead when he slipped underneath the tape of catcher J.T. Realmuto as Zach Davies reached on a fielder's choice. Jonathan Villar drove home Arcia with a single, putting the Brewers up 4-2, and Koehler gave up another single, this time to Eric Thames, loading the bases for Ryan Braun, who struck out. Shaw plated another pair with a single and Santana drew a walk, loading the bases again, and bringing Koehler's day to an end.  We got off to a decent start and got two runs,  Marlins manager Don Mattingly said.  Even if they got three or four, you can keep the game there and manage it. It gets to seven and then you have trouble getting back into it. It is a big hill to get back into it. Every run they score seems like a spike.  Milwaukee scored one more when Vance Worley walked Vogt with the bases loaded before Broxton struck out a second time to end the inning.  We just had good at-bats against Koehler and made him work really hard, so we survived,  Brewers manager Craig Counsell said.  He got a big out with striking out Brauny and we were still in. Travis had a nice at-bat. Domingo had a nice at-bat. Stephen Vogt had a nice at-bat. So that was big two-out at-bats there.  Davies gave up two more in the third but settled in from there and worked six full innings, allowing four runs on five his and two walks while striking out five.  I really thought he got it going,  Counsell said.  The last three innings, especially the last two innings, I thought they may have been his best two innings of the season. I mean, the command was as good as we've seen it. The glove wasn't moving. He was hitting the glove really well. Certainly encouraging and hopefully something he can take out of it.  NOTES: Umpire Joe West was behind the plate Saturday, a day after he was hit in the head by a baseball thrown from the stands at Miller Park.

Other pharmaceutical giants including Merck & Co, Johnson & Johnson and Sanofi are also exploring the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) to help streamline the drug discovery process.   The aim is to harness modern supercomputers and machine learning systems to predict how molecules will behave and how likely they are to make a useful drug, thereby saving time and money on unnecessary tests.  AI systems already play a central role in other high-tech areas such as the development of driverless cars and facial recognition software.  Many large pharma companies are starting to realize the potential of this approach and how it can help improve efficiencies,  said Andrew Hopkins, chief executive of privately owned Exscientia, which announced the new tie-up with GSK. Hopkins, who used to work at Pfizer, said Exscientia's AI system could deliver drug candidates in roughly one-quarter of the time and at one-quarter of the cost of traditional approaches. The Scotland-based company, which also signed a deal with Sanofi in May, is one of a growing number of start-ups on both sides of the Atlantic that are applying AI to drug research. Others include U.S. firms Berg, Numerate, twoXAR and Atomwise, as well as Britain's BenevolentAI.  In pharma's eyes these companies are essentially digital biotechs that they can strike partnerships with and which help feed the pipeline,  said Nooman Haque, head of life sciences at Silicon Valley Bank in London.  If this technology really proves itself, you may start to see M&A; with pharma, and closer integration of these AI engines into pharma R&D.;  FILE PHOTO: A cyclist rides past a logo of drugs and chemicals group Merck KGaA in Darmstadt, Germany, January 28, 2016.Ralph Orlowski/File PhotoStill to Be Proven It is not the first time drugmakers have turned to high-tech solutions to boost R&D; productivity. The introduction of  high throughput screening , using robots to rapidly test millions of compounds, generated mountains of leads in the early 2000s but notably failed to solve inefficiencies in the research process. FILE PHOTO: A Johnson & Johnson building is shown in Irvine, California, U.S., January 24, 2017.Mike Blake/File PhotoWhen it comes to AI, big pharma is treading cautiously, in the knowledge that the technology has yet to demonstrate it can successfully bring a new molecule from computer screen to lab to clinic and finally to market.  It's still to be proven, but we definitely think we should do the experiment,  said John Baldoni, GSK's head of platform technology and science. Baldoni is also ramping up in-house AI investment at the drugmaker by hiring some unexpected staff with appropriate computing and data handling experience - including astrophysicists. His goal is to reduce the time it takes from identifying a target for disease intervention to finding a molecule that acts against it from an average 5.5 years today to just one year in future.  That is a stretch. But as we've learnt more about what modern supercomputers can do, we've gained more confidence,  Baldoni told Reuters.  We have an obligation to reduce the cost of drugs and reduce the time it takes to get medicines to patients.  Earlier this year GSK also entered a collaboration with the U.S. Department of Energy and National Cancer Institute to accelerate pre-clinical drug development through use of advanced computational technologies. The new deal with Exscientia will allow GSK to search for drug candidates for up to 10 disease-related targets. GSK will provide research funding and make payments of 33 million pounds  ($43 million), if pre-clinical milestones are met.

Stephens allowed three runs in five innings and also had a two-run single to lift the Cincinnati Reds to a 5-3 victory over the Chicago Cubs at Great American Ball Park. Stephens (1-0), who was recalled from Triple-A Louisville prior to the game, had eight strikeouts and only one walk to earn his first career win.  He threw strikes in the first inning, which isn't always easy for a guy in his debut,  Reds manager Bryan Price said.  He challenged batters in the zone. He had two competitive innings in four and five (allowing one hit with three strikeouts). Great debut for a young guy.  Adam Duvall had an RBI double and Joey Votto went 2-for-3 with a walk to get within three hits of 1,500 for his career as Cincinnati (35-45) has taken the first two games of the weekend series. Raisel Iglesias pitched 1 1/3 scoreless innings to earn his 15th save. Jon Jay hit his first home run of the season and Willson Contreras added a two-run shot for Chicago. The Cubs (40-41) were hoping Thursday's ninth-inning rally at Washington would provide a spark heading into this series. Instead, they have dropped the first two games to a Reds team they've beaten in 23 of the past 30 meetings. Related CoveragePreview: Cubs at RedsChicago Cubs - PlayerWatchCincinnati Reds - PlayerWatch We get everybody healthy right now ... I'm very confident that we'll start looking like we're supposed to look,  Cubs manager Joe Maddon said.  Overall, the starting pitching has been erratic, I can't deny that. But if you hit with a little more consistency, you cover some of that.  If Stephens was nervous on Saturday, it wasn't easy to tell. He allowed three hits through the first two innings with four strikeouts.  Of course, there were butterflies,  said Stephens, who had around 30 family members and friends in attendance Saturday.  I was able to keep myself composed. I feel like I belong here. I didn't lay an egg. I just embraced the opportunity.  Stephens' first taste of big-league level adversity came during his second time through the Cubs' lineup. Jay homered with one out. Two batters later, Contreras crushed a 1-1 pitch deep to left-center, making the score 3-0. It was Contreras' 10th home run of the season.  The only time he was vulnerable was when he gave up the home run to Jay,  Price said.  His breaking ball got a lot better after that inning.  Cubs starter Eddie Butler (4-3) allowed four earned runs on five hits in 3 2/3 innings. Duvall's RBI double and a bases-loaded walk by Butler cut the Reds' deficit to 3-2 in the fourth. Price decided to allow Jackson to bat for himself, mostly because he wanted to get another inning to see what he could do at the major league level. The decision paid off handsomely when Jackson laced Butler's first pitch past a diving Addison Russell for his first major league hit, driving in two runs to put Cincinnati ahead 4-3 for his first professional RBIs.  It was just enough to get past Addy,  Stephens said.  I was just happy to get a hit. The hard part was going back out there and trying to put up another zero.  Stephens' knock highlighted a frustrating afternoon for Butler.  I located probably my best fastball of the day to the pitcher and he hits a six-hopper up the middle,  Butler said.  That's frustrating.  The Cubs missed several scoring chances on Saturday. They had inning-ending double plays in the second and sixth innings.  It's our inability to move the ball in RBI situations,  Maddon said.  We have to score more than three runs.  With the Reds needing to add depth to what is now a seven-man bullpen, Price wasn't certain if Stephens could hang around for another start. Regardless, Price said Saturday's experience was worthwhile.  There are a lot of balls in the air on this one,  Price said.  The big thing, he faced the world champs. They had Bryant back in the lineup, Zobrist on the bench. I enjoyed watching him pitch.  NOTES: Cubs Ben Zobrist was reinstated from the disabled list on Saturday.

Other pharmaceutical giants including Merck & Co, Johnson & Johnson and Sanofi are also exploring the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) to help streamline the drug discovery process.   The aim is to harness modern supercomputers and machine learning systems to predict how molecules will behave and how likely they are to make a useful drug, thereby saving time and money on unnecessary tests.  AI systems already play a central role in other high-tech areas such as the development of driverless cars and facial recognition software.  Many large pharma companies are starting to realize the potential of this approach and how it can help improve efficiencies,  said Andrew Hopkins, chief executive of privately owned Exscientia, which announced the new tie-up with GSK. Hopkins, who used to work at Pfizer, said Exscientia's AI system could deliver drug candidates in roughly one-quarter of the time and at one-quarter of the cost of traditional approaches. The Scotland-based company, which also signed a deal with Sanofi in May, is one of a growing number of start-ups on both sides of the Atlantic that are applying AI to drug research. Others include U.S. firms Berg, Numerate, twoXAR and Atomwise, as well as Britain's BenevolentAI.  In pharma's eyes these companies are essentially digital biotechs that they can strike partnerships with and which help feed the pipeline,  said Nooman Haque, head of life sciences at Silicon Valley Bank in London.

The introduction of  high throughput screening , using robots to rapidly test millions of compounds, generated mountains of leads in the early 2000s but notably failed to solve inefficiencies in the research process. FILE PHOTO: A Johnson & Johnson building is shown in Irvine, California, U.S., January 24, 2017.Mike Blake/File PhotoWhen it comes to AI, big pharma is treading cautiously, in the knowledge that the technology has yet to demonstrate it can successfully bring a new molecule from computer screen to lab to clinic and finally to market.  It's still to be proven, but we definitely think we should do the experiment,  said John Baldoni, GSK's head of platform technology and science. Baldoni is also ramping up in-house AI investment at the drugmaker by hiring some unexpected staff with appropriate computing and data handling experience - including astrophysicists. His goal is to reduce the time it takes from identifying a target for disease intervention to finding a molecule that acts against it from an average 5.5 years today to just one year in future.  That is a stretch. But as we've learnt more about what modern supercomputers can do, we've gained more confidence,  Baldoni told Reuters.  We have an obligation to reduce the cost of drugs and reduce the time it takes to get medicines to patients.  Earlier this year GSK also entered a collaboration with the U.S. Department of Energy and National Cancer Institute to accelerate pre-clinical drug development through use of advanced computational technologies. The new deal with Exscientia will allow GSK to search for drug candidates for up to 10 disease-related targets. GSK will provide research funding and make payments of 33 million pounds  ($43 million), if pre-clinical milestones are met.

A brief Vatican statement said Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Mueller's five-year mandate as head of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, a department charged with defending Catholic doctrine, would not be renewed. The position is the most important one that a pope fills in the Vatican hierarchy after the Secretary of State. Most incumbents keep it until they retire, which in Mueller's case would have been in six years.   Mueller, 69, who was appointed by former Pope Benedict in 2012, will be succeeded by the department's number two,  Archbishop Luis Francisco Ladaria Ferrer. Ladaria, a 73-year-old Spaniard who, like the Argentine pope is a member of the Jesuit order, is said by those who know him to be a soft-spoken person who shuns the limelight. Mueller, by contrast, often appears in the media.  They speak the same language and Ladaria is someone who is meek. He does not agitate the pope and does not threaten him,  said a priest who works in the Vatican and knows both Mueller and Ladaria, asking not to be named. Since his election in 2013, Francis has given hope to progressives who want him to forge ahead with his vision for a more welcoming Church that concentrates on mercy rather than the strict enforcement of rigid rules they see as antiquated. Mueller is one of several cardinals in the Vatican who have publicly sparred with the pope. Second Conservative Departure in Three Days  FILE PHOTO: Former Pope Benedict embraces newly elected cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Muller of Germany during a consistory ceremony led by Pope Francis in Saint Peter's Basilica at the Vatican February 22, 2014.Max Rossi/File PhotoHis departure follows the high-profile exit of fellow conservative Cardinal George Pell, the Vatican economy minister who took a leave of absence on Thursday to face charges of historical sexual abuse in his native Australia.   In 2015 both were among 13 cardinals who signed a secret letter to the pope complaining that a meeting of bishops discussing family issues was stacked in favor of liberals. The letter was leaked, embarrassing the signatories.  Clearly, the pope and Cardinal Mueller have not been on the same page for five years,  the priest said. Slideshow (2 Images)Mueller has criticized parts of a 2016 papal treatise called  Amoris Laetitia  (The Joy of Love), a cornerstone document of Francis' attempt to make the 1.2 billion-member Church more inclusive and less condemning. In it, Francis called for a Church that is less strict and more compassionate toward any  imperfect  members, such as those who divorced and remarried, saying  no one can be condemned forever .  Conservatives have concentrated their criticism on the document's opening to Catholics who divorce and remarry in civil ceremonies, without getting Church annulments. Under Church law they cannot receive communion unless they abstain from sex with their new partner, because their first marriage is still valid in the eyes of the Church and therefore they are seen to be living in an adulterous state of sin. In the document the pope sided with progressives who had proposed an  internal forum  in which a priest or bishop decide jointly with the individual on a case-by-case basis if he or she can be fully re-integrated and receive communion. After the document was published Catholic bishops in some countries, including Germany, enacted guidelines on how priests could allow some divorced and remarried Catholics to receive the sacraments. But Mueller has said there should be no exceptions, making him a hero to conservatives who have made the issue a rallying point for their opposition to Francis.

Three other people were hurt in a frantic rush to the exits. The ages of the wounded ranged from 16 to 35.

The shooting started at about 2:30 a.m. local time on Saturday, about 30 minutes after the downtown club's scheduled closing time, local media reported. A bystander's video broadcast by local media showed the crowded club at the moment gunshots rang out, followed by the sound of people screaming in the dark. After the shooting, the city revoked the Power Ultra Lounge's liquor license and the club would shut down, Stodola said.  This activity downtown is going to cease,  he said.  Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson said it was time for the state to do more to reverse what he described as an intensifying crime problem in the state capital.

Shin quit the U.S. LPGA Tour four years ago and switched to Japan to be closer to home. “I think I’m a little bit lucky because I started early in the morning,” said Shin, who got most of her round under her belt before a testing breeze sprang up, posting an eight-under 205 total with one round left. Shin has won 15 times on the JLPGA Tour, where purses average around $1 million.  “I very much enjoy (it there) because there is less traveling and more three-day tournaments, so physically I feel much better,” said the 29-year-old. “This year I gained more distance -- I think between 15 and 20 yards -- so that makes it a little bit easier.

I just didn't hang any pitches,  Hamels said. Sometimes, the simplest approach is most effective. Hamels showed flashes of dominance as he pitched into the seventh inning, and the Rangers pulled away for a 10-4 win over the Chicago White Sox. The veteran southpaw did not allow a hit after the first inning, when Melky Cabrera doubled off him and Jose Abreu took him deep for a two-run home run. Elvis Andrus, Mike Napoli and Rougned Odor each hit a home run for the Rangers. Texas (40-41) snapped a three-game losing streak and won at Guaranteed Rate Field for the first time since 2015. Hamels (3-0) said he was not aware he retired his final 19 opponents. He held the White Sox to two runs on two hits in 6 2/3 innings before manager Jeff Banister pulled him after 96 pitches to keep him fresh. Related CoveragePreview: Rangers at White SoxTexas Rangers - PlayerWatchChicago White Sox - PlayerWatch My whole game plan is to throw strikes,  Hamels said.  It didn't happen to the first couple guys the way I'd like. It's more just bear down and throw strikes. Be aggressive in the strike zone.  White Sox left-hander Derek Holland (5-8) was not nearly as sharp in his first career matchup against his former teammates. The longtime Rangers southpaw gave up five runs on five hits in five innings. Chicago (35-45) lost for the ninth time in the past 13 games. The White Sox dropped to 3-24 when opponents rack up double-digit hits.  It was intense,  Holland said of facing his friends on Texas.  I mean, obviously you know they want to hit the home runs off me and they want to crush me just like I want to strike them out. I thought everything was there. Just a few things got away. Nothing to beat myself up over.  The White Sox opened the scoring on a two-run shot by Abreu in the first inning. The blast marked Abreu's 15th home run of the season and his second in as many days at Guaranteed Rate Park. Texas trimmed the deficit to 2-1 in the second. The Rangers loaded the bases with nobody out but pushed across only one run on a groundout by Jonathan Lucroy. In the fifth, Texas scored three more runs to seize a 4-2 lead. Lucroy drew a leadoff walk and scored the tying run on a double by Delino DeShields. Andrus followed with a two-run home run that landed just beyond the glove of Cabrera in left field. As Cabrera retreated to the warning track, Andrus did not know whether the ball would clear the fence for his 11th home run.  I hit it good but too high,  Andrus said.  And then when I saw him going back, back, I kind of was blowing that ball, too. I'm really glad it went out.  Napoli belted a two-run homer in the sixth to make it 6-2. The White Sox pulled within 6-4 on a pinch-hit, two-run double by Kevan Smith during the seventh. Smith's hit down the right-field line scored Yolmer Sanchez and Adam Engel. Odor hit a home run down the right-field line to lead off the eighth. After the Rangers loaded the bases later in the inning, Nomar Mazara put the game out of reach with a triple that bounced past Cabrera.  Those are huge,  Banister said.  Those add-on runs give us a little bit of breathing room.  White Sox manager Rick Renteria said Andrus and Napoli earned their homers despite a strong wind blowing out.  Those are both two strong men,  Renteria said.  They were able to get it and use what they needed to generate the loft and the carry. We had the same opportunity, so it plays equally.  NOTES: Rangers manager Jeff Banister revealed Saturday that he would use a closer-by-committee approach until further notice. The skipper's announcement came one day after RHP Matt Bush blew his fifth save opportunity of the season. Bush will be part of the closer committee along with LHP Alex Claudio, RHP Jose Leclerc and RHP Keone Kela. ... White Sox OF Avisail Garcia was held out of the lineup for the third straight game because of a sore knee. He said he hoped to return within the next two days. ... Rangers LHP Martin Perez (broken right thumb) tentatively is slated to start Monday against the Boston Red Sox. The 26-year-old sustained the injury when he caught the tip of his thumb in the door of his hotel room. ... White Sox SS Tim Anderson returned to the lineup after a two-day stint on the bench. He went 0-for-4.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-rangers-whitesox-writethru-idUSMTZED71FMBLES"},

Since at least May, hackers used tainted  phishing  emails to  harvest credentials  so they could gain access to networks of their targets, according to a joint report from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and Federal Bureau of Investigation. The report provided to the industrial firms was reviewed by Reuters on Friday. While disclosing attacks, and warning that in some cases hackers succeeded in compromising the networks of their targets, it did not identify any specific victims.  Historically, cyber actors have strategically targeted the energy sector with various goals ranging from cyber espionage to the ability to disrupt energy systems in the event of a hostile conflict,  the report said. Homeland Security and FBI officials could not be reached for comment on the report, which was dated June 28. The report was released during a week of heavy hacking activity.  A virus dubbed  NotPetya  attacked on Tuesday, spreading from initial infections in Ukraine to businesses around the globe. It encrypted data on infected machines, rendering them inoperable and disrupting activity at ports, law firms and factories.  On Tuesday the energy-industry news site E&E; News reported that U.S. investigators were looking into cyber intrusions this year at multiple nuclear power generators. Reuters has not confirmed details of the E&E; News report, which said there was no evidence safety systems had been compromised at affected plants.  Department of Homeland Security emblem is pictured at the National Cybersecurity & Communications Integration Center (NCCIC) located just outside Washington in Arlington, Virginia September 24, 2010.Hyungwon Kang/File PhotoThe activity described in the U.S. government report comes at a time when industrial firms are particularly anxious about threat that hackers pose to their operations.  Industrial firms, including power providers and other utilities, have been particularly worried about the potential for destructive cyber attacks since December 2016, when hackers cut electricity in Ukraine.  U.S. nuclear power generators PSEG (PEG.N), SCANA Corp (SCG.N) and Entergy Corp (ETR.N) said they were not impacted by the recent cyber attacks. SCANA's V.C. Summer nuclear plant in South Carolina shut down on Thursday due to a problem with a valve in the non-nuclear portion of the plant, a spokesman said. A projection of cyber code on a hooded man is pictured in this illustration picture taken on May 13,  2017.Kacper Pempel/IllustrationAnother nuclear power generator, Dominion Energy (D.N), said it does not comment on cyber security.  Two cyber security firms said on June 12 that they had identified the malicious software used in the Ukraine attack, which they dubbed Industroyer, warning that it could be easily modified to attack utilities in the United States and Europe.  Industroyer is only the second piece of malware uncovered to date that is capable of disrupting industrial processes without the need for hackers to manually intervene. The first, Stuxnet, was discovered in 2010 and is widely believed by security researchers to have been used by the United States and Israel to attack Iran's nuclear program. The U.S. government report said attackers conducted reconnaissance to gain information about the individuals whose computers they sought to infect so that they create  decoy documents  on topics of interest to their targets. In an analysis, it described 11 files used in the attacks, including malware downloaders and tools that allow the hackers to take remote control of victim's computers and travel across their networks.  Chevron Corp (CVX.N), Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) and ConocoPhillips (COP.N), the three largest U.S. oil producers, declined to comment on their network security.

Yemen has been devastated by a 27-month war between a Saudi-led coalition and the armed Iran-aligned Houthi group, making it a breeding ground for the disease, which spreads by faeces getting into food or water and thrives in places with poor sanitation. Speaking at a joint news conference with representatives of the United Nations Children Fund (UNICEF) and the World Bank, Zagaria said that had been some 246,000 suspected cases in the period to June 30.

Two of those wounded at the Power Ultra Lounge were in critical condition, Little Rock Police Chief Kenton Buckner told reporters at a press conference, while the rest of the victims suffered what he described as non-life-threatening injuries. Three other people were hurt in a frantic rush to the exits. The ages of the wounded ranged from 16 to 35. Buckner said no suspects had been taken into custody in connection with the melee, which may have stemmed from a dispute between rival groups. He said the general public was not believed to be at risk and that the incident was not related to terrorism.  On a Fourth of July weekend, where we wish to anticipate having fun with our friends and family, this is certainly a terrible, terrible tragedy,  Mayor Mark Stodola said at the news conference. The shooting started at about 2:30 a.m. local time on Saturday, about 30 minutes after the downtown club's scheduled closing time, local media reported. A bystander's video broadcast by local media showed the crowded club at the moment gunshots rang out, followed by the sound of people screaming in the dark. After the shooting, the city revoked the Power Ultra Lounge's liquor license and the club would shut down, Stodola said.  This activity downtown is going to cease,  he said.  Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson said it was time for the state to do more to reverse what he described as an intensifying crime problem in the state capital.  We are still gathering facts, but it is clear that we need to have a comprehensive enforcement strategy in place that helps take the violent threats off the streets,  he said in a statement.  The club was hosting a concert by the hip-hop artist Finese 2Tymes on Friday night, according to the club's Facebook page.  A promotional page for the performance shows a young man looking down the sight of what appears to be a gun, with the barrel pointed at the viewer.

Armed men in pickup trucks opened fire on a group of police officers on a major highway near the beach resort of Mazatlan, according to the state police and state attorney general's office.  State Public Security Minister Genaro Robles Casillas said in a news conference on Saturday that drug gangs have been fighting over trafficking routes in the area where the violence occurred.  Aided by federal forces, the police fought off the attackers and pursued them to the nearby town of La Amapa, where the gunfight resumed, according to a press release from the state police. Seventeen gunmen were killed in the shootouts with police, and another two people died nearby in what appears to be earlier, related shootings, the attorney general's office said in another press release. No police died. However, five suffered gunshots and are in stable condition, with two of those officers suffering head wounds, according to state police.  Found at the scene were 16 semiautomatic rifles, nine handguns and a shotgun, the attorney general's office said. The coastal state of Sinaloa is a focal point in Mexico's drug war. It is home to the Sinaloa cartel, whose most well known boss, Joaquin  El Chapo  Guzman, was extradited to the United States in January to face trial.  Police killed 17 people for every officer lost in gunbattles in 2014, according to a study by Mexico's National Autonomous University, a number experts say is consistent with excessive use of force. In 2015, Mexican police executed nearly two dozen suspected gang members after ambushing them at a ranch near the town of Tanhuato in the violent western state of Michoacan, one of the worst abuses by security forces in a decade of grisly drug violence. Some 30,000 people have disappeared in Mexico since drug violence increased sharply around 2007. Since former president Felipe Calderon sent the army out to battle drug gangs at the end of 2006 more than 150,000 have been killed.

Heavy rain turned what, on paper, had looked like a regulation 14-km circuit alongside the Rhine river into an incident-packed Grand Depart that could have major consequences in the three-week battle for the yellow jersey. While it was a great start for Team Sky, with Thomas, three-times champion Froome, Vasil Kiryienka and Michal Kwiatkowski  all in the top eight of the 198 riders to start, Movistar's Alejandro Valverde's Tour is already over after a sickening crash. Several riders continued after crashing on the greasy roads but there was no getting up for Valverde, third overall in 2015, after he careered into crowd barriers after skidding off before being taken to hospital with leg injuries. It was heart-breaking for Valverde and also a huge blow for team mate Nairo Quintana who would have been counting on Valverde's experience in the mountain stages to come to have a real chance of halting Froome's bid for a hat-trick. Welshman Thomas, riding his eighth Tour de France, looked completely at home in the puddles as he became the eighth Briton to wear the yellow jersey -- making up for the disappointment of crashing out of the Giro d'Italia as team leader.

I'm going to enjoy tomorrow and any extra day I have in the yellow jersey will now be a bonus.  With Tour favorite Froome finishing 12 second back -- significantly ahead of all of his General Classification rivals -- it was a perfect day for Team Sky who have seized early control. Thomas was given the responsibility of being team leader at this year's Giro d'Italia and had high hopes of winning his first Grand Tour before a crash caused by a police motorbike forced him out with a shoulder injury. Cycling - The 104th Tour de France cycling race - The 14-km (8.7 miles) individual time-trial Stage 1 - Duesseldorf, Germany - July 1, 2017 -  Team Sky rider Geraint Thomas of Britain rides during the stage.Christian HartmannHis hopes a medal in the Olympic road race last year were also wrecked by a crash and he has taken his fair share of punishment while riding for Sky. So he will enjoy his hard-earned top-dog status for as long as it lasts in his eighth Tour de France before resuming duties as Froome's trusty deputy on the roads of France.  It's been a rough time on the bike this year and it's nice to finally have this win,  he said.  It certainly makes up for most of the Giro.  With three Team Sky riders in the top six it was a day of dominance for the British team under a cloud because of an investigation by UK Anti-Doping into allegations of wrongdoing -- a situation brought on by a mystery package delivered to Bradley Wiggins at the 2011 Criterium du Dauphine. Team Sky have denied any wrongdoing.   Even on Saturday, Thomas's moment was slightly overshadowed by a reporter questioning the legality of the team's skin suits.  I just wear the suit and pedal as fast as I can,  a slightly nonplussed Thomas said. He was happier to talk about a great day for Welsh sport, having watched Sam Warburton, who went to the same Cardiff school, lead the British and Irish Lions to victory over rugby giants the New Zealand All Blacks.  I was just thinking of the Lions last night when I went to bed, now I have my own little lion as well,  he said.  It was an inspiration for me. It was great to watch that, I'm buzzing off of that. Helped take my mind off this.  Reporting by Martyn Herman; Editing by Toby Davis","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-cycling-france-thomas-idUSKBN19M3S2"},

Geraint Thomas snatched the overall lead after a skilful ride on the wet streets of Duesseldorf as Sky finished with four riders in the top eight, with defending champion Chris Froome gaining time on all his rivals.  For the riders it must be disappointing to see how strong Sky are,  American LeMond, who is on the Tour as an analyst for Eurosport, told Reuters.  Colombian Nairo Quintana, runner-up to Froome in 2013 and 2015, limited his losses to 36 seconds, but lost key Movistar team mate Alejandro Valverde, who abandoned after crashing into a safety barrier.  Now if you're Quintana you have no Valverde and you have to attack. I haven't seen in the last couple of years anybody strong enough to drop Chris Froome,  added LeMond. Almost all the top climbers behind Froome finished within seven seconds of each other -- from Australian Richie Porte, who lost 35 seconds, to Alberto Contador who lost 42.  There could have been bigger differences but the weather limited the losses for the climbers,  noted LeMond.  Every Tour de France is different but Sky got a big confidence booster today. It could be a race for second. But I think it's good that they have the pressure.   There is one way to release the pressure, however -- let another team assume the duties of controlling the race by not fighting to keep the yellow jersey.  I was impressed by (sprint specialist) Marcel Kittel. I think he is going for the yellow jersey and if Sky are smart they are not going to control it -- let the sprinters take over. That is what I would do,  said LeMond. Kittel ended up 16 seconds behind Thomas on Saturday, and with 10 seconds of time bonus for Sunday's stage winner, the ride to Liege could see the German claim the lead if Thomas lets the sprinters' teams ride away in the final straight.  Some of those flat stages you're not going to want to follow those crazy sprinters,  added LeMond.  I think Marcel is going to try to focus on the yellow jersey.

The Czech, who reckoned it was  great to be back  just six months since her career was left hanging in the balance after an attacker stabbed her playing hand, explained on Saturday how life had been put into perspective for her by the trauma.  I think I am little bit different on the court and off the court, too,  said the 27-year-old, who hopes that the three-year gap between her titles in 2011 and 2014 could prove a happy omen in  2017.  I think I see life and tennis from a little bit different angle than before. Before, I was very nervous before every match. Now I see that I shouldn't be. There's things in the life that should be more important than just tennis.  I'm not sure if it is the result of what happened, but maybe I feel a bit fearless because of what happened.   I find out what's important and what is not. Sometimes I'm thinking on the court that I already won the biggest fight, and if I fight in the match, it doesn't matter if I win or lose the last point. I will still be happy to play.  This attitude of being somehow freed to play uninhibited tennis has already served the left-hander well as evidenced by victory in the warm-up Edgbaston grasscourt tournament in just the second event of her comeback.  I felt very surprised. I'm still surprised,  she said.  I think the grass is always giving me extra confidence. Through the tournament, I felt like every round I played better and better, which is always good sign.  It's tough to say the level of my game. As I said, in Birmingham, it was going up. I will see how I wake up on Monday. Wimbledon feels like my second home. It feels great to be here again.  I think we still do have a great players in the draw, even if (defending champion) Serena (Williams) is not playing. I think there's a few favourites but it's very open. So who knows who going to win?  If Kvitova prevails, it would be a fairytale comeback, and she is adamant she has never lost the  passion  for the task at hand.   I found out how I missed tennis through the period I didn't play. It was a difficult time to watch girls playing on the TV, me sitting on the sofa with the hand in a splint. I find out then how I love this sport. I still do have the passion.

Kohl, who died on June 16 at 87, was lauded at a ceremony at the European Parliament as a dedicated European who abhorred war by former U.S. President Bill Clinton, Russia Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and other figures. A funeral service was held later on Saturday with 900 invited guests at Speyer Cathedral, where as a teenager Kohl found shelter from World War Two aerial bombings.  His casket was flown by helicopter from Strasbourg to his hometown Ludwigshafen before being carried by boat up the Rhine to Speyer, one of Germany's oldest towns where Kohl took former world leaders including Clinton, George H.W. Bush, Mikail Gorbachev, Boris Yeltsin and Margaret Thatcher for private meetings.  Helmut Kohl gave us the chance to be involved in something bigger than ourselves, bigger than our terms in office and bigger than our fleeting careers,  Clinton said in Strasbourg of the man who was German chancellor from 1982 to 1998 and oversaw German reunification in 1990. The two-hour memorial in Strasbourg, a city that has often changed hands and now lies in France, symbolized the role Kohl played in reconciling the two erstwhile enemies France and Germany while driving European integration forward. A blue European Union flag was draped over Kohl's casket in Strasbourg. A German flag later covered the coffin in Germany, where thousands watched from the streets as his coffin moved through Ludwigshafen and later from the banks of the Rhine.  He was the architect of the world order,  said Medvedev of Kohl, who skillfully negotiated reunification with communist East Germany with then-Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.  In Russia, we'll remember him as our friend -- a wise and sincere person.

The ceremony concluded with the German national anthem and excerpts from Beethoven's 9th symphony  Ode to Joy , used as the anthem of the European Union.  The proposal to hold a European ceremony was enthusiastically advocated by Juncker, and by Kohl's second wife Maike Kohl-Richter, who survives him.

The shutdown went into effect just after midnight on Saturday after legislators failed to pass a budget, stymied by a dispute over a plan to take money from the state’s biggest health insurance company. Lawmakers were in the state capital, Trenton, on Saturday to work on resolving the standoff over the measure, pushed by Governor Chris Christie as way to help fund drug addiction services. Despite the shutdown, state police, prisons, child welfare services, NJ Transit buses and trains, and other health and safety operations were still functioning, but other services such as motor vehicle inspections ground to a halt. Christie, a Republican who has the lowest approval rating of any governor in New Jersey history, said he returned to his office at 9:30 a.m. ready to work. His family was at the governor’s residence at the state beach that had been closed to the public as a result of the shutdown. At issue is a push by the governor to force the nonprofit insurer Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield to spend some of its billions in reserves on public health services or return money to subscribers. Christie said he would remove about $150 million in school funding and other items previously agreed with Democrats unless the Assembly passed the Horizon bill. But Assembly Speaker Vincent Prieto and other Democrats say the Horizon bill, introduced only on Thursday, is “bad public policy.” Prieto blamed the governor for “holding the state budget hostage.” Some Democrats in the Senate and Assembly have sided with Christie. An Assembly vote on the budget stalled late on Friday, as some Democrats abstained from voting, fearing Christie’s veto of important items without an agreement on the Horizon bill. The governor, at a news conference on Saturday morning, repeatedly blamed Prieto for the impasse. “If the Horizon bill comes in, I will sign the budget,” he said, adding that he was open to counteroffers. Christie said the plan to restructure Horizon was only recently presented because it had not occurred to him earlier. It has been vetted by legal advisors, he said, adding, “It’s about transparency and accountability ... and the potential for a fiscal play down the line.” All 80 of the Assembly's seats are up for re-election in November, when New Jersey will also vote on a new governor to replace Christie, whose second and final term as governor is ending. The new governor will inherit a gaping public pension shortfall, which has contributed to 11 credit downgrades during Christie's tenure. New Jersey's credit rating is now the second lowest in the United States, above only Illinois.

In the last 14 editions, one of either Federer, the seven-times champion, double winners Rafael Nadal and Andy Murray, or triple victor Novak Djokovic has lifted the men's singles title at The All England Club. While reporters quizzed Federer on Saturday about who in the game's young brigade could become the first man outside that quartet to win since Lleyton Hewitt in 2002, the Swiss felt it would be best to keep faith with the usual suspects. Federer's rivals have had mixed preparations for Wimbledon. Murray's harboured hip trouble after an early exit at Queen's, Nadal decided to skip grasscourt warm-ups to rest his body after winning the French Open while Djokovic burst into life earlier on Saturday by winning the Eastbourne title. Do not be fooled, suggested Federer. All these 30-something luminaries would again be  tough to beat .  Depending how fit it is, if he's anything close to 100 percent physically, I consider him (Murray) one of the big favourites to win the tournament. It's that simple. It's the same for Novak and the same for Rafa,  reckoned Federer.  I think it's very even when we put it all out on the line. Everybody has their own little story right now.  Queen's for Andy (where he was knocked out early) doesn't matter so much because I feel like he's one of the best players in the first week at Wimbledon, so I don't worry too much for him there. He can play himself into shape for week two.  Novak is just coming back from winning Eastbourne now. Rafa is coming in red hot from the clay. So I see it positive for them rather than negative in some shape, which I'm sure people will try to see that way.  But I see that they are going to be tough to beat here.  Federer himself seemed to have recaptured a touch of his fantastic early-season spark which saw him down Nadal in an epic Australian Open five-set final as he lifted his favourite pre-Wimbledon grasscourt title in Halle. Yet the 35-year-old is too old a hand to insist that this is going to be a four-horse race.   Yeah, it's been very dominant by a few players here at Wimbledon. That's surprising. It's like that -- but it can change tomorrow very quickly.  It is not just the younger guns, headed, he says, by Milos Raonic, Kei Nishikori, Grigor Dimitrov, Alexander Zverev, Nick Kyrgios and Dominic Thiem who  are in a good spot right now where they can go very deep .  Then, I do believe the favourites are the other players. I include the likes of (Marin) Cilic into that, Stan (Wawrinka), guys who have done it before,  added the Swiss. Nobody, of course, has done it before as often as the 18-time grand slam champion Federer himself, who admitted it  hurt  to miss out on competing on the sapping clay of the French Open when he knew he was fit and raring to go.

LePage has insisted on a budget with deeper spending cuts than those contemplated by lawmakers and has promised to veto any spending plan that raises taxes.  This is about the future of Maine. The Maine people are taxed enough. I will not tax them anymore and in my budget overall taxes were decreased,  LePage said in a statement announcing the partial shutdown, the first in the state since 1991. The governor's order for a partial closure of state government went into effect at 12:01 a.m. local time after negotiations stalled over a $7.055 billion, two-year budget. A six-member bipartisan budget committee with lawmakers from the House and Senate had reached a deal on a proposed budget late on Thursday night, but LePage signaled he would veto the package because it included some tax increases. The Republican-controlled Senate passed the package by a 34-1 vote on Friday, and later in the day the Democratic-controlled House approved it by an 87-60 vote. But the margin of approval fell short of the two-thirds threshold needed to override LePage's threatened veto. Even if two-thirds of the House voted for approval, state law gives the two-term governor up to 10 days to respond to the legislation, allowing for a partial shutdown during that time.  State police, parks and all offices responsible for collecting revenue will continue to operate during the current shutdown, LePage has said. A spokeswoman for the governor could not be reached for comment on Saturday. Lawmakers met in the state capital Augusta on Saturday, but they had no formal counterproposal from the governor to consider, said Mary-Erin Casale, a spokeswoman for Democratic House Speaker Sara Gideon.  Right now we are in a very fluid situation where we don’t have anything in front of us,  Casale said by telephone. The stalled budget proposal would have repealed a measure that voters approved in November to impose an additional 3 percent income tax on state residents who earn more than $200,000 a year. But it contained a 1.5 percent increase in the lodging tax, Casale said, while increasing funding for public education by $162 million.

Western governments including the United States have said the Syrian government carried out the attack in the town of Khan Sheikhoun which killed dozens of people. The Syrian government has denied using chemical weapons. The attack prompted a U.S. missile strike against a Syrian air base which Washington said was used to launch the strike. The report into the attack was circulated to members of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) in The Hague, but was not made public. In a statement, the Syrian foreign ministry said the fact-finding team had based its report on  the testimonies offered by terrorists in Turkey . Turkey is a major backer of the Syrian opposition to President Bashar al-Assad. After interviewing witnesses and examining samples, the fact-finding mission of the OPCW concluded that  a large number of people, some of whom died, were exposed to sarin or a sarin-like substance .  Russia, Assad's most powerful ally, has described the report as biased. The attack on April 4 in the town of Khan Sheikhoun in northern Idlib province was the most deadly in Syria's civil war in more than three years. Western intelligence agencies had also blamed the Assad government. Syrian officials have repeatedly denied using banned toxins in the conflict. A joint United Nations and OPCW investigation has found Syrian government forces were responsible for three chlorine gas attacks in 2014 and 2015 and that Islamic State militants used mustard gas. Syria joined the chemicals weapons convention in 2013 under a Russian-U.S. agreement, averting military intervention under then U.S. President Barack Obama. The United States said on Wednesday the Syrian government appeared to have heeded a warning this week from Washington not to carry out a chemical weapons attack.  Russia warned it would respond proportionately if the United States took pre-emptive measures against Syrian forces after Washington said on Monday it appeared the Syrian military was preparing to conduct a chemical weapons attack.

It's funny that it also started in Germany 30 years ago. It was a very similar route, unpredictable,  Martin, whose cousin Nicolas Roche is also in the race, told Reuters.  There are a few good omens in my pocket there.  The 30-year-old Martin, ninth overall last year, knows that family ties will be of no help when he tackles the unusually steep climbs of this year's route.  It will be a worthy winner and I just hope that I get through the first stages without bad luck and let the legs do the talking,  the Quick-Step Floors rider said. While three-time champion Chris Froome can rely Team Sky's climbing specialists in the mountains, Martin will have to ride on his own as his team has been built around German sprinter Marcel Kittel, who hopes to add to his nine Tour stage wins. That will not be a problem for Martin, who even believes the team set-up is an advantage as he will be sheltered on the flat stages, where the lightweight climbers are more exposed.  At the end of the day, if every team had five climbers there'd be 100 riders at the top of the climbs and that's not what the Tour is about,  he explained.  Even the teams who have so called climbers there, you saw the Dauphine (a warm-up race to the Tour last month)... on the last stage we were only 10 riders at the top of the climb after 25 km. If the racing here is as aggressive as on the Dauphine then there will be no team mates.  Luckily for Martin, the way the route has been designed, with only three summit finishes, makes for unpredictable, aggressive racing.  The course suits me well -- the steeper climbs are better. You don't need a team as much for sure and it is definitely a good route for exciting racing, I hope so anyway,  he said.  There will be opportunities to gain or lose time every couple of days in this race, it's important be in good condition from the start.  The peloton is usually extremely nervous in the opening block of racing and crashes are legion. With Quick-Step Floors, arguably the most experienced teams on the flat where wind gusts can cause splits in the peloton, Martin is well protected.  Its definitely one of the strongest teams in the race on the flat stages and that's my weak point,  he said.  I've always been able to handle myself in the mountains but my worry has always been those first stages.  The Tour starts on Saturday with a 14-km time trial in Duesseldorf, where Martin will be out to limit his losses.

Bridwell was hurt by one bad inning --  the fifth when the Mariners scored four times, three coming on a home run by Robinson Cano. The Angels went into the game 4-0 in games Bridwell had pitched in this season. Bridwell's season ERA went up from 2.95 to 3.95.  Early on, Parker got some pitches in good zones and got out of a little bit of trouble and managed to keep us in the game,  Angels manager Mike Scioscia said.  But he couldn't get the ball into good spots in the fifth. One thing with Parker, he was pitching ahead in the count in his good games, and tonight, he reversed that. He had to work back into counts a lot of those guys swung the bats well.  RHP Brooks Pounders was called up from Triple-A Salt Lake on Friday. It's Pounders' fourth stint with the big league club, having gone 1-0 with a 4.91 ERA in eight appearances. Pounders pitched 2 1/3 innings in Friday's game against Seattle and was optioned back to Salt Lake after the game to make room for RHP Bud Norris. CF Mike Trout took live batting practice on the field Friday for the first time since he tore a ligament in his left thumb and had surgery. Trout, who said things went well, will need at least another three days of batting practice before he will begin a rehab assignment, which likely will last for a game or two. With Friday's 10-0 loss to the Mariners, the Angels are 16-15 since Trout was injured on May 28 INF/OF Nick Franklin was acquired Friday from the Milwaukee Brewers in a trade for a player to be named or cash considerations. Franklin, who is expected to be activated to the big league roster Saturday, hit .195 with two homers and 10 RBIs in 53 games for Milwaukee this season. LHP Jose Alvarez was optioned to Triple-A Salt Lake on Friday. Alvarez, who was the only lefty in the bullpen, was 0-3 with a 5.40 ERA in a staff-high 40 games. Angels manager Mike Scioscia said Alvarez is dealing with command issues and also lost his release point on his breaking ball. RHP Ricky Nolasco will start Saturday against the Mariners. He had lost seven consecutive starts, and the Angels had lost 10 in a row in games started by Nolasco. With that weight on his shoulders, he had to face a hot Dodgers club last Monday that had won 10 in a row. But Nolasco flipped the script, throwing 6 1/3 scoreless innings to end the losing streak. He is 1-4 with a 4.76 ERA in seven career starts against Seattle. RHP Bud Norris, on the disabled list since June 19 with right knee inflammation, has completed his minor league rehab assignment and is expected to be activated to the major league roster on Saturday. Before the injury, Norris was the Angels primary closer, with 11 saves and a 2.43 ERA in 34 games.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-angels-playerwatch-idUSMTZED71F8LP6U"},

Blackburn will start in place of RHP Jharel Cotton (right thumb blister), whose next start will be pushed back a few days. Blackburn went 5-6 with a 3.05 ERA in 15 games, including 14 starts, for Nashville. The A's acquired him from Seattle on Nov. 12, 2016, in exchange for 1B/3B Danny Valencia.

The rookie homered on a 3-2 fastball to deep right in the 3-1 loss. Olson's homer was his fourth of the season.  I was just trying to have a good at-bat, the way he was throwing against us,  said Olson, a native of Atlanta.  Hitting a home run to break up the no-hitter was just the cherry on top. I was seeing him fairly well all night and just missing. He had a lot of life on his fastball.  RHP Sonny Gray (3-4) allowed one run and two hits in a season-high eight innings but took the defeat Friday night in a 3-1 loss to Atlanta at Oakland Coliseum. He struck out four, walked one and threw 98 pitches.  He's been consistent with his stuff,  A's managers Bob Melvin said of Gray.  Finally got results tonight. We just didn't score any runs for him.  RHP Jorge Lopez was optioned to Double-A Biloxi on Friday. He made just one appearance for the Brewers, covering the final two innings of a victory Thursday in Cincinnati. In 16 appearances this season for Biloxi, Lopez is 3-6 with a 5.04 ERA. 3B Matt Chapman (left knee cellulitis) fielded ground balls and took batting practice for the first time since going on the disabled list June 19. He'll go through a pregame workout again Saturday, and if all goes well, the rookie could go on a rehab assignment Sunday, A's manager Bob Melvin said.  Feeling back to normal,  Chapman said.  It's good to be back, good to be back out on the field and see my teammates again. Seems to be coming along nicely. We're taking all the right steps to get me back on the field as soon as possible but making sure that it's right.  Chapman spent four nights in a hospital while receiving antibiotics intravenously. He checked out of the hospital on Sunday. Melvin said Chapman will probably need only one or two rehab games before he's ready to be activated. Chapman started his first four major-league games during a four-game series sweep against the Yankees on June 15-18. He hit .214 with one double and three RBIs and played stellar defense at third base.  He made an impact right away,  Melvin said.  He's one of those guys you just feel better when he's in the lineup.  1B Yonder Alonso (right knee contusion) was out of the lineup for the second straight game Friday night when the A's opened a three-game series against Atlanta. He pinch hit in the eighth inning of Oakland's 3-1 loss and struck out. He left Wednesday's game against Houston after fouling a ball off his knee in the eighth inning.  He's a little better,  A's manager Bob Melvin said.  He took some ground balls today and hit a little bit. Felt pretty good but just not enough to start the game today. So hopefully he will start tomorrow. ","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-athletics-playerwatch-idUSMTZED71F8LP6T"},

This will be his first start against the Angels, but he's established himself in the Mariners rotation, going 3-2 with a 3.38 ERA in nine games (eight starts).

Fulmer came within one out of a complete-game shutout but didn't finish the game as the Royals scored three runs. He's the first pitcher to give up three or more runs after tossing 8 2/3 shutout innings with no one on base since the Yankees' Melido Perez on July 8, 1994. The last Detroit pitcher to lose a shutout bid in that fashion was Frank Lary on Aug. 8, 1959.

Kohl, who died on June 16 at 87, was lauded at a ceremony at the European Parliament as a dedicated European who abhorred war by former U.S. President Bill Clinton, Russia Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and other figures. A funeral service was held later on Saturday with 900 invited guests at Speyer Cathedral, where as a teenager Kohl found shelter from World War Two aerial bombings.  His casket was flown by helicopter from Strasbourg to his hometown Ludwigshafen before being carried by boat up the Rhine to Speyer, one of Germany's oldest towns where Kohl took former world leaders including Clinton, George H.W. Bush, Mikail Gorbachev, Boris Yeltsin and Margaret Thatcher for private meetings.  Helmut Kohl gave us the chance to be involved in something bigger than ourselves, bigger than our terms in office and bigger than our fleeting careers,  Clinton said in Strasbourg of the man who was German chancellor from 1982 to 1998 and oversaw German reunification in 1990. The two-hour memorial in Strasbourg, a city that has often changed hands and now lies in France, symbolized the role Kohl played in reconciling the two erstwhile enemies France and Germany while driving European integration forward. A blue European Union flag was draped over Kohl's casket in Strasbourg. A German flag later covered the coffin in Germany, where thousands watched from the streets as his coffin moved through Ludwigshafen and later from the banks of the Rhine.  He was the architect of the world order,  said Medvedev of Kohl, who skillfully negotiated reunification with communist East Germany with then-Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.  In Russia, we'll remember him as our friend -- a wise and sincere person.

Helmut Kohl was a German patriot and a European patriot,  said Juncker, a former Luxembourg prime minister and close friend of Kohl who switched between German and French in his tribute.  We've lost a giant of the post-war era.  Slideshow (25 Images)Chancellor Angela Merkel, who served as a minister under Kohl in the 1990s but later had a falling out over his role in receiving $1 million in illegal campaign cash donations, remembered Kohl as an at-times controversial figure with numerous enemies.  I could tell you stories as well,  she said.  But all that paled in comparison to his life's achievements.  Merkel said Kohl had changed the lives of millions across all of Europe. The ceremony concluded with the German national anthem and excerpts from Beethoven's 9th symphony  Ode to Joy , used as the anthem of the European Union.  The proposal to hold a European ceremony was enthusiastically advocated by Juncker, and by Kohl's second wife Maike Kohl-Richter, who survives him. His sons, however, boycotted the Cathedral's funeral mass, because their father will not be laid to rest alongside Hannelore Kohl, his wife of decades.

The former world number returned to the circuit last month after giving birth to Leo in December, and both mother and son have traveled to London as the Belarussian gears up for her first grand slam since last year's French Open.  Being back here with an extra member of my team is really special,  a smiling Azarenka told a news conference on Saturday.  It feels great. I didn't play last year, so it feels like it's been, you know, almost two years that I didn't play here.  Being a mother comes with added responsibility -- and luggage -- but the good news is that Leo likes to travel, while Azarenka is confident she has struck the right balance between the demands of her sport and her family.  He's actually a very good traveler,  she said.  I think I stress out more because I want to make sure that everything is going great... He is totally fine. He loves the plane.  But it's definitely a little bit more luggage. And with a stroller there... I didn't know you can't bring your stroller out in London, so we had to carry him all through the airport... till we got to the customs, which was really weird.  The 27-year-old said she had initially struggled with being away from Leo and had to trick herself into not feeling any guilt as she prepared for her comeback.  Well, the changes, it's like 180 in your mentality, your daily activities,  she added.  Being in an individual sport, you have to be a little bit more selfish.  It's a little bit of a mind trick that I have to do... not feel guilty that I don't spend my every free second with my son, which is sometimes tough.  But it also gives me a really good balance when I am done with my practice or my matches, that I'm able to shut off from tennis, just lose myself with my son.  There have been a number of changes on the circuit during her absence, including a host of unfamiliar faces, and Azarenka's first challenge will be to get past 40th-ranked American teenager Catherine Bellis in her opening match on Monday.

EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said she was  quite confident  that a broad agreement can be announced at a summit on July 6 with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe as both sides finalize the reduction of tariffs on autos and agricultural goods. Clinching a deal would offer Japan and Europe an important political victory and could raise questions about the U.S. government's influence on the agenda for the global economy.  You can do good, fair, transparent and sustainable trade agreements where you win and I win, and not the American view, which seems to be, 'You lose and I win,'  Malmstrom told reporters. Malmstrom spoke after two days of meetings with Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida in Tokyo about a deal that would eliminate a broad range of trade barriers.

However, Malmstrom expressed confidence that both sides have overcome this problem and can reach a deal.

Nadal spurned the chance of a warm-up tournament at Queen's Club to put less pressure on his body after his exertions at Roland Garros. He opted to fine tune his game in Mallorca instead. Now, Spain's two-times champion is determined to improve on a series of shock defeats he has suffered to unheralded opposition at Wimbledon since winning his last title in 2010 and reaching the final the following year. Nadal lost to Lukas Rosol in the second round in 2012 when struggling with knee problems, Steve Darcis in 2013 (first round), the then new boy Nick Kyrgios in 2014 (fourth round) and Dustin Brown in 2015 (second round) before missing last year with a wrist injury. Yet he is adamant that the losses have not left a scar.  My motivation is always high in all the events that I play. If not, I am not playing,  said Nadal, whose victory in Paris took his grand slam total to 15.  It's true that what happened with my knees in 2012 was more difficult (but) at the same time, it's true that in 2014 I played a good event when I lost in the fourth round against Nick. But I had my chances, too. FILE PHOTO: Tennis - Aspall Tennis Classic - London, Britain - June 30, 2017   Spain’s Rafael Nadal reacts after his match against Germany’s Tommy Haas   Action Images via Reuters/Peter Cziborra After that, last year I couldn't play (and) 2015 was not my year, of course.  Let's see what's going on this year. I know it's always difficult. I am excited to be playing again here, in a tournament that I really love. But at the same time I tell you, it's a tournament that you can go out very early.  But if I am able to go through at the beginning, I think I am with confidence. I am playing well since the beginning of the season, so let's see.  This is somewhat of an understatement from the modest 31-year-old. Since reaching the Australian Open final at the start of the year, where only a dazzlingly rejuvenated Roger Federer could eclipse him, Nadal has won four clay titles. At times he has looked something near to his rampaging finest. Nadal confirmed that his coach Carlos Moya would not be attending Wimbledon with him but added that his uncle Toni would be part of his  great team . He sounded refreshed by his spell training at home.  It was great,  he said.  I would love to have been playing in Queen's, obviously,  but after the last three months and after what happened in Roland Garros, we decided that for my body it was better to have a slower change to the grass.

Investors are watching for any sign that the ECB may reduce its stimulus, which includes massive bond purchases and ultra-low rates, after a hint in that direction by President Mario Draghi boosted the euro and government bond yields this week.      It will hopefully come and we're working on that, we're also discussing it,  Weidmann, a long-standing critic of the ECB's bond purchases, told an audience at the Bundesbank's open days. Inflation in the euro zone has been low for years and it is not expected to reach the ECB's target of just under 2 percent until at least 2019 despite the central bank's efforts. But price growth is now comfortably above 1 percent, leading some rate setters, particularly in the wealthier northern countries of the currency union, to call for a reduction in the ECB's monetary largesse.  What we are discussing and even arguing about is how expansive monetary policy should be given our target,  Weidmann said during a question-and-answer session with the public. ECB President Draghi said this week Frankfurt could make tweaks to its policy to accompany the recent economic recovery in the euro zone. This has strengthened market expectations that the ECB would wind down its 2.3 trillion euros ($2.63 trillion)bond purchases next year and start raising rates thereafter. The ECB's policy of low rates has been unpopular with sections of the German public and political class, who fear it erodes returns on savings while bankrolling indebted governments in the south of the bloc.

The German suffered a humiliating first-round exit at the French Open in May, losing to 40th-ranked Ekaterina Makarova and becoming the first top seed to be eliminated from the tournament at the very first hurdle in the professional era. She was also forced to withdraw from a warm-up tournament in Birmingham last month with a hamstring injury, but said on Saturday that she had recovered from that setback.    It's great to be back,  Kerber told a news conference ahead of Wimbledon, which starts on Monday.  I'm feeling good ... I'm healthy so far, so this is very important for me.  I'm not thinking about Paris, about the claycourt season any more ... I'm starting from zero here. My mind is just day-by-day here, like last year. I will try to play good tennis again.  Kerber finished runner-up at Wimbledon last year, losing to Serena Williams in the final. And with expectant mother Williams not defending her title at SW19 this year, Kerber said the tournament would have a different feel about it.  Of course, it's different if Serena is not here,  the German added.   I will not put the pressure too far, too high. I'm here to really try to focus day-by-day, not thinking too far, not thinking about other things, making the things maybe, again, a little bit not too complicated.  I mean, everything is possible, in two weeks especially. It's a long time. So we will see.  Such has been the deterioration in Kerber's form over the past few months that the German said it could take her months to get back to her best.  I will not put the pressure on Wimbledon,  she added.  I have still the next months where I have big tournaments.  Of course I am here to play good tennis, try to win every single match. But I will think more about the next half-year ... I think this is more in my mind to not put too much pressure now for this tournament on my belt.  Kerber kicks off her campaign on Monday against American Irina Falconi, who is ranked 246th in the world.

We have a full moral right to say 'no',  Kaczynski said in a speech broadcast on television. Last month the European Commission launched a legal case against Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic for refusing to take in asylum seekers, highlighting the feud within the 28-nation bloc over how to deal with migration.  Kaczynski, who has criticized the European Union's relocation schemes for migrants on many occasions, also said that the PiS could not be accused of being anti-European, as it backed Poland's joining the block in 2004 and now appreciates the inflow of EU funds.   The fact that we appreciate them (the funds), does not mean that we have lost the right to various assessments, including those regarding the historical context,  Kaczynski said, adding that Poland has never received any compensation for the losses it suffered during the Second World War.  During his 70-minute speech, the PiS leader suggested the government increase social spending if the economic situation allows. He also said there was a need to reduce the share of foreign capital in the media sector.

Investors are watching for any sign that the ECB may reduce its stimulus, which includes massive bond purchases and ultra-low rates, after a hint in that direction by President Mario Draghi boosted the euro and government bond yields this week.      It will hopefully come and we're working on that, we're also discussing it,  Weidmann, a long-standing critic of the ECB's bond purchases, told an audience at the Bundesbank's open days. Inflation in the euro zone has been low for years and it is not expected to reach the ECB's target of just under 2 percent until at least 2019 despite the central bank's efforts. But price growth is now comfortably above 1 percent, leading some rate setters, particularly in the wealthier northern countries of the currency union, to call for a reduction in the ECB's monetary largesse.  What we are discussing and even arguing about is how expansive monetary policy should be given our target,  Weidmann said during a question-and-answer session with the public. ECB President Draghi said this week Frankfurt could make tweaks to its policy to accompany the recent economic recovery in the euro zone. This has strengthened market expectations that the ECB would wind down its 2.3 trillion euros ($2.63 trillion)bond purchases next year and start raising rates thereafter. The ECB's policy of low rates has been unpopular with sections of the German public and political class, who fear it erodes returns on savings while bankrolling indebted governments in the south of the bloc.   Weidmann said the issue for rate setters was when to show resolve and normalize the ECB's policy in the face of political pressures to keep it easy longer than necessary.

Mini makes around 70 percent of its approximately 360,000 compact cars at its Oxford plant in southern England but the car industry is concerned about the effect any loss of unfettered access to the EU, its largest export market, could have on plants after Brexit. BMW is deciding between its English site, a plant in the Netherlands where it has built more of its conventional line-up in recent years, and its Germany plants at Leipzig and Regensburg for the new low-emissions variant.  The firm's board member for sales told Reuters that the electric Mini investment, likely to be worth tens of millions of pounds, would come in the next three months and the board was currently considering a number of factors including Brexit.  One of the elements is what is the likelihood of a tax regime and if there's a tax regime, how would it apply,  Ian Robertson said during an interview at the Goodwood Festival of Speed in southern England.  If you made the motor in a German plant and you then assembled the car in a British plant, and you took the cars back to the German market, then the duty that you would pay would be reclaimed,  he said, in an example of the options companies are examining to plan for any duties or tariffs. The automaker is also looking into where the uptake of greener models is strongest and where the best supply chains are, he said.  Britain could approve its first major electric battery hub in the next few weeks after officials in central England submitted proposals to ministers in May. But last month, the car industry issued its strongest warning yet on the need for politicians to strike a transitional Brexit deal after two-year talks to ensure unfettered trade is maintained. Uncertainty has also been heightened after a snap June 8 election which left Prime Minister Theresa May without a majority and has led to ministers in her administration hinting at different versions of Britain's likely post-Brexit future. Last year, May's administration helped secure two new models at Japanese carmaker Nissan's plant in the north of England after what a source said was a government promise of extra support to counter any loss of competitiveness caused by Brexit. Robertson told Reuters there was an  open channel  with officials and that he had several meetings with the Brexit ministry and with business minister Greg Clark, who has visited BMW in Munich, with their teams in regular contact. But, asked whether the government could make promises now regarding future tax or tariff arrangements as BMW neared its decision, he said he did not believe that ministers were in a position to do so.   Any of these discussions about a guarantee, it's not possible,  he said.  Reporting by Costas Pitas","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-bmw-mini-idUSKBN19M3KN"},

But after three years of Islamic State rule, it is now little more than a pile of stones at the center of a shattered city. By all accounts except their own, the jihadists rigged the mosque and its 850-year-old tower with explosives and blew them up last week as advancing Iraqi forces came within steps of the complex. A Reuters visit to the site on Friday, a day after Iraq's military recaptured it, confirmed the extent of destruction: the 45-metre (148 ft) al-Hadba minaret had been reduced to a stump while the mint green dome was the only part of the prayer hall still standing. Fighting raged on a few blocks away. Bullets whizzed past the main gate, which is largely intact, and a mortar fell on an adjacent building. Below the mosque's dome in July 2014, Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi delivered a Friday sermon presenting himself at the head of a modern-day caliphate spanning swathes of territory which the al Qaeda offshoot group had just seized in Iraq and neighboring Syria.  I am your leader, though I am not the best of you,  he said, wearing the black turban and robes denoting a claim to descend from the Prophet Mohammad. Within months, Islamic State was carrying out and inspiring militant attacks in places as far abreast as Paris, London and California. An international military coalition led by the United States quickly coalesced to confront the group. Three years on, the inscribed pulpit where he spoke lies in ruins. The mosque grounds are covered in stone and concrete, and a segment of a secondary minaret is one of the only discernable objects in the rubble. The risk of unexploded ordnance or mines prevented a thorough inspection of the site's interior.     Baghdadi's appearance at the Nuri mosque was the first time he revealed himself to the world, and the footage broadcast then is to this day the only video recording of him as  caliph . He long ago left the fighting in Mosul and Syria's Raqqa to local commanders and is believed to be hiding in the border area between the two countries, according to U.S. and Iraqi military sources. He has frequently been reported killed, including last month by Russia and Iran. The ruined Grand al-Nuri Mosque is seen after it was retaken by the Iraqi forces from the Islamic State militants at the Old City in Mosul, Iraq, June 30, 2017.Alaa Al-MarjaniAfter his speech in 2014, Baghdadi descended from the pulpit to lead his followers in worship, standing in a prayer niche which is now just barely recognizable amid the wreckage. Crumbling Caliphate Baghdadi's project, to revive the Islamic caliphate which mostly disappeared with the fall of the Ottoman Empire in the early 20th century, is also crumbling.     Slideshow (13 Images)The group still rules over an area which by one estimate is equivalent to the size of Belgium. But experts say its territorial losses undermine its legitimacy and attractiveness to potential recruits who once flocked from across the world in the tens of thousands. The Nuri mosque was named after Nuruddin al-Zanki, a noble who fought the early crusaders from a fiefdom that covered territory in modern-day Turkey, Syria and Iraq. It was built in 1172-73, shortly before his death, and housed an Islamic school. By the time renowned medieval traveler and scholar Ibn Battuta visited two centuries later, the minaret was leaning. The tilt gave the landmark its popular name: the hunchback. The mosque's military and religious history embodied the spirit of Mosul, a diverse but predominately Sunni Muslim city which supplied Iraq's armed forces with officers for much of the 20th century. The Hadba minaret, whose tilt begs comparisons to Italy's Tower of Pisa, was built with seven bands of decorative brickwork in complex geometric patterns also found in Persia and Central Asia. Only slivers of that design are now visible among the rubble. The eight-month-old U.S.-backed battle for Mosul has also destroyed homes and basic infrastructure across the city and displaced nearly a million residents. Civilians, mostly women and children, rushed past the demolished mosque as they crossed the frontline towards Iraqi forces. They were thirsty and tired, and some were injured. Across the street, among the detritus of war, laid the partial remains of an Islamic State fighter dressed in red clothing.

Senate Republican leaders had set Friday as the target for rewriting legislation for a simultaneous repeal and replacement of extensive parts of the 2010 Affordable Care Act, the law dubbed Obamacare that expanded health insurance coverage to 20 million people. The deadline seemed unlikely to be met given that most senators had left Washington ahead of next week's recess, without agreement on a clear direction for the healthcare bill, and Trump's tweet did not appear to gain political traction. Financial markets showed little reaction to Trump’s suggestion, with the benchmark S&P; 500 index edging about 0.15 percent higher on the day. Shares of most health insurers gained fractionally while hospital stocks were little changed. Related CoverageWhite House says fully committed to draft Senate healthcare billTrump wrote on Twitter Friday morning,  If Republican Senators are unable to pass what they are working on now, they should immediately REPEAL, and then REPLACE at a later date!   The White House said later that Trump was still  fully committed  to pushing the Republican draft healthcare bill through the Senate, although it was looking at every option for repealing and replacing Obamacare.  The president hasn't changed his thinking at all,  White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters.

Conservative and moderate Republicans have spent recent days pushing and pulling the bill in opposite directions as Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell sought common ground. Moderates want more equity for low-income Americans, while conservatives are fighting to loosen insurance regulations. Shortly before his January inauguration, Trump urged lawmakers to repeal and replace Obamacare at the same time.  Congressional Republicans had considered earlier this year first repealing, then replacing Obamacare, but backed away after some lawmakers protested that that approach could create a gap in insurance coverage for millions. On Friday, Republican Senator Ben Sasse who had suggested that Congress first repeal Obamacare and then replace it, tweeted:  Glad you agree, Mr. Pres.  Conservative Senator Rand Paul also backed the idea. But others on Capitol Hill sounded annoyed. A senior Senate Republican aide, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that if lawmakers had been able to get the votes for repealing Obamacare first, then replacing it,  senators would have done that in January. It doesn't have the votes, and it's a waste of valuable time to discuss it.  Annie Clark, a spokeswoman for moderate Republican Senator Susan Collins, said the lawmaker would not support the strategy. McConnell's spokesman declined to comment on Trump's tweet.    A senior House of Representatives Republican, Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady, said in an interview for CSPAN's  Newsmakers  program that lawmakers' goal should continue to be  not simply repealing but to start to put into place the elements that can make healthcare affordable.

Denmark's Wozniacki, the world number six who had hoped to regain the title she last won in 2009, held on in game fashion but succumbed to a break of serve in each set and, despite a second set push, could not dent Pliskova's formidable delivery.

Police blocked roads, preventing pro-democracy protesters from getting to the harbor-front venue close to where the last colonial governor, Chris Patten, tearfully handed back Hong Kong to China in the pouring rain in 1997. Xi said Hong Kong should crack down on moves towards  Hong Kong independence .       Any attempt to endanger China's sovereignty and security, challenge the power of the central government ... or use Hong Kong to carry out infiltration and sabotage activities against the mainland is an act that crosses the red line and is absolutely impermissible,  Xi said. He also referred to the  humiliation and sorrow  China suffered during the first Opium War in the early 1840s that led to ceding Hong Kong to the British. Hong Kong has been racked by demands for full democracy and, more recently, by calls by some pockets of protesters for independence, a subject that is anathema to Beijing. Xi's speech was his strongest yet to the city amid concerns over what some perceive as increased meddling by Beijing, illustrated in recent years by the abduction by mainland agents of some Hong Kong booksellers and Beijing's efforts in disqualifying two pro-independence lawmakers elected to the city legislature.  It's a more frank and pointed way of dealing with the problems,  said former senior Hong Kong government adviser Lau Siu-kai on Hong Kong's Cable Television.  The central government's power hasn't been sufficiently respected... they're concerned about this.  The tightly choreographed visit was full of pro-China rhetoric amid a virtually unprecedented security lockdown close to the scene of pro-democracy protests in 2014 that grabbed global headlines with clashes and tear gas rising between waterfront skyscrapers. Xi did not make contact with the people in the street or with any pro-democracy voices, forgoing an opportunity to lower the political heat through a softer, more nuanced approach.  The hardening stance of the democrats and Beijing could perhaps widen, spawning greater radicalism, though some activists also concede a spreading disillusionment has sapped momentum among the democracy movement since Xi came to power. Under the mini-constitution, the Basic Law, Hong Kong is guaranteed wide-ranging autonomy for  at least 50 years  after 1997 under a  one country, two systems  formula praised by Xi. It also specifies universal suffrage as an eventual goal. Pro-democracy protesters carry a banner which reads  One Country, Two Systems, a cheating for twenty years.

Most Urgent  Protest in Years In the afternoon, tens of thousands gathered in sweltering heat in a sprawling park named after Britain's Queen Victoria, demanding Xi allow universal suffrage. Organizers put the figure at more than 60,000.   Xi shouldn't be interfering in Hong Kong too much,  Peter Lau, a 20-year-old university student, said.  Despite him visiting garrisons and muscle-flexing, Hong Kong people's confidence will never be shaken. Especially for our generation. We should ... fight for our freedom.   Slideshow (22 Images)Some demonstrators marched with yellow umbrellas, a symbol of democratic activism in the city, and held banners denouncing China's Communist  one party rule . Others criticized China's Foreign Ministry which on Friday said the  Joint Declaration  with Britain over Hong Kong, a treaty laying the blueprint over how the city would be ruled after 1997,  no longer has any practical significance .

A small group of pro-democracy activists near the venue were roughed up by a group of men who smashed up some props in ugly scuffles.

Lawyers for de Havilland, whose 101st birthday is on Saturday, said the network and Ryan Murphy Productions did not consult with her and that she is the only living person to be depicted in the eight-part miniseries. De Havilland was portrayed by Catherine Zeta-Jones in  Feud,  which starred Jessica Lange as Joan Crawford and Susan Sarandon as Bette Davis. The series explored the complex tension and bad blood between the two Hollywood screen legends in the later years of their life, especially during their filming on 1962's  What Ever Happened to Baby Jane.  Critics warmly received the series, touting it as a strong contender for next month's Emmy nominations.   De Havilland's complaint was filed in Los Angeles Superior Court. Representative for Murphy and FX Networks, a unit of Twenty-First Century Fox Inc did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment. In an April interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Murphy said he did not contact de Havilland because he  didn't want to be disrespectful and ask her,  Did this happen? Did that happen? What was your take on that?   In the complaint, lawyers criticized Zeta-Jones' depiction of de Havilland giving an interview that they said had never taken place in real life, even though the series intended for viewers to believe it was true. The complaint adds that de Havilland was portrayed as a  petty gossip  in the show, which her lawyers argued was damaging to her  professional reputation for integrity, honesty, generosity, self-sacrifice and dignity.   The complaint requests a jury trial to determine damages that include emotional distress and economic losses as well as profits made by defendants using de Havilland's likeness. De Havilland, best known for the 1939 film  Gone With the Wind,  won two Oscars in a career spanning 50 movies that was also marked by a legendary feud with younger sister and fellow Oscar-winner Joan Fontaine that was worthy of a screenplay. Fontaine died in 2013. De Havilland moved to Paris in the 1950s, where she currently resides, and has only made rare public appearances since retiring.

Schaeuble told Deutschlandfunk radio that he hoped there could be tax relief beyond that already promised 15-billion euro income tax cut. The conservative Christian Democrats will present details on that with their campaign platform on Monday.  We're planning, all in all, to do more than just correcting the income taxes by 15 billion euros,  he said, referring to plans to reduce the country's  cold progression  tax increases -- or  clandestine tax increases. Germany does not adjust tax brackets for inflation, unlikely many other countries. Schaeuble said that aside from fighting  cold progression , the Christian Democrats want to support young families to build new housing while also supporting research and development for small- to medium-sized companies.  He said he would like to start dismantling the so-called  Solidarity Tax  in 2020 that was introduced after German unification to help pay for the costs of rebuilding infrastructure in formerly Communist East Germany. Schaeuble has rejected criticism that the income tax cuts of 15 billion years a year were too low to significantly boost economic growth through consumption.  Economists and business lobby groups inside and outside Germany have demanded an overhaul of Germany's tax system, namely steeper tax relief that would boost consumption and growth and a lower corporate tax rate that would encourage private investments. The International Monetary Fund and European Commission have said that Germany has room to lift investments on hard and digital infrastructure, which would help reduce its current account deficit and benefit weaker euro zone peers.    Germany invested about 2.2 of output on roads, bridges schools and kindergarten each year on average between 2005 and 2014, significantly lower than the average of 3.3 percent among members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). A recent study by the Bertelsmann Foundation think-tank found that if Germany boost investments to the OECD average, its economy would grow 1.6 percent each year on average until 2025 -instead of 1.4 percent if investment levels remain at their current level - and tax revenue would grow by 80 billion euros. Schaeuble has said he prefers to use the higher tax revenues made possible thanks to steady growth fueled by consumption, a robust labor market, a booming construction sector and higher state spending to reduce public debt.

Schultz is now chairman of Starbucks after stepping down from his previous role as chief executive.

Starbucks customer Annisa Meidiana, who is a Muslim, said she would not stop buying coffee there because of the call for the boycott.  Islam condemns LGBT.

They cannot quote a single incident to prove that we are terrorists,  Salahuddin told a news conference in Muzaffarabad, the capital of the Pakistani portion of Kashmir, where he has been based for some 25 years as leader of the Hizbul Mujahideen, the largest of the anti-Indian Kashmiri militant groups.  This idiocy can neither weaken our courage, nor stop the freedom struggle and the target-oriented actions of freedom fighters,  he added, saying his fighters' attacks were on legitimate military targets as opposed to civilians.

Security forces in Indian-administered Kashmir have been accused by activists and rights groups of killing up to 100 separatist protesters since new mass anti-India demonstrations broke out in September. In Monday's announcement, the U.S. State Department said that in September 2016 Salahuddin had threatened to train more Kashmiri suicide bombers and vowed to turn the Kashmir valley  into a graveyard for Indian forces . As a consequence of the designation, U.S. individuals are banned from engaging in financial transactions with Salahuddin and all his property in the United States is blocked. Salahuddin, who is from Badgam town in Indian-administered Kashmir, was an Islamist politician who turned to militancy after he lost an election for the Kashmir legislative assembly in 1987, which he says was  massively rigged  by India.

President Rodrigo Duterte took office in the Philippines a year ago, launching a bloody war on drugs that has killed thousands of Filipinos.  PREVIOUSLY FROM REUTERS INVESTIGATES: Philippine police use hospitals to hide drug war killings Podcast: Dead on arrival in Duterte's drug war In a television interview to mark the anniversary, Philippine National Police (PNP) chief Ronald dela Rosa appeared irritated by questions about the Reuters report, published on Thursday, and said police carrying out anti-drugs operations had a duty to save lives, even when encountering violent resistance.  He said police were not medically qualified to determine whether a victim was dead or alive and sent victims to hospital as part of operational procedure.   What do you want, we let the wounded die? You don't want us to rescue his life?  he told news channel ANC.  The Reuters investigation analyzed crime data from two of Metro Manila's five police districts and included accounts of doctors, witnesses, law enforcement officials and victims' families. [nL8N1JQ2NQ]  It showed a pattern of police sending dead bodies to hospitals, preventing thorough crime scene investigations from taking place after the killing of drug suspects. [nL8N1JQ2NQ]  Dela Rosa said Reuters, which has produced a series of in-depth reports into the war on drugs that have questioned official accounts, was  looking for faults  in the police.   PNP is damned if you do, damned if you don't. Reuters really is looking for faults in us. We have to stand by our police operational procedure that in case of an encounter, if a person is not yet declared dead by the physician, you need to bring him to the hospital.   He added:  Who are the policemen to say they are dead? They are not medical practitioners. If we did not bring them to the hospitals, the relatives might sue us.   A spokeswoman for Reuters said the news agency stood by its reporting.  Duterte's bloody campaign has been condemned by human rights groups and alarmed Western countries due to the high death toll and allegations of systematic extrajudicial killings and cover-ups by police. The PNP rejects those allegations.  Few Survivors  Reuters looked at police reports covering the first eight months of the drug war, which showed that in Quezon City Police District and neighboring Manila Police District, 301 victims were sent to hospital after police anti-drug operations. Only two survived and the rest were dead on arrival.  In nearly all cases where drug suspects have died during police operations in the year-long crackdown, the official accounts say police fired in self defense. Police say they do not shoot to kill.  Activists, however, say the circumstances behind many of the killings in police sting operations point to executions. A Reuters investigation last year found that when police opened fire in anti-drug operations, they killed 97 percent of people they shot.  The data analyzed in the latest Reuters investigation shows a sharp increase in the number of drug suspects declared dead on arrival in the Quezon City and Manila districts each month.  There were 10 cases when the drug war started a year ago in July 2016, or 13 percent of police drug shooting deaths. By January 2017, the tally rose to 51 cases, or 85 percent, at a time when criticism of Duterte's campaign intensified.  A police commander who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity said the increase was no coincidence and police were  trying to prevent crime scene investigations and media attention that might show they were executing suspects.  Human rights groups say the anti-drugs crackdown, the signature policy of the populist Duterte, has been disastrous and has almost entirely targeted the poor, with most of those killed or arrested drug users and small-time dealers, with narcotics kingpins largely untouched.  Dela Rosa said police should not be disparaged for trying to save victims and the removal of bodies from a crime scene did not mean a proper investigation could not be carried out.   Do not put malice in what the police does,  he said.  The  crime scene is there even without the dead body.

Police blocked roads, preventing pro-democracy protesters from getting to the harbor-front venue close to where the last colonial governor, Chris Patten, tearfully handed back Hong Kong to China in the pouring rain in 1997. Xi said Hong Kong should crack down on moves towards  Hong Kong independence .       Any attempt to endanger China's sovereignty and security, challenge the power of the central government ... or use Hong Kong to carry out infiltration and sabotage activities against the mainland is an act that crosses the red line and is absolutely impermissible,  Xi said. He also referred to the  humiliation and sorrow  China suffered during the first Opium War in the early 1840s that led to ceding Hong Kong to the British. Hong Kong has been racked by demands for full democracy and, more recently, by calls by some pockets of protesters for independence, a subject that is anathema to Beijing. Xi's speech was his strongest yet to the city amid concerns over what some perceive as increased meddling by Beijing, illustrated in recent years by the abduction by mainland agents of some Hong Kong booksellers and Beijing's efforts in disqualifying two pro-independence lawmakers elected to the city legislature.  It's a more frank and pointed way of dealing with the problems,  said former senior Hong Kong government adviser Lau Siu-kai on Hong Kong's Cable Television.  The central government's power hasn't been sufficiently respected... they're concerned about this.  The tightly choreographed visit was full of pro-China rhetoric amid a virtually unprecedented security lockdown close to the scene of pro-democracy protests in 2014 that grabbed global headlines with clashes and tear gas rising between waterfront skyscrapers. Xi did not make contact with the people in the street or with any pro-democracy voices, forgoing an opportunity to lower the political heat through a softer, more nuanced approach.  The hardening stance of the democrats and Beijing could perhaps widen, spawning greater radicalism, though some activists also concede a spreading disillusionment has sapped momentum among the democracy movement since Xi came to power. Under the mini-constitution, the Basic Law, Hong Kong is guaranteed wide-ranging autonomy for  at least 50 years  after 1997 under a  one country, two systems  formula praised by Xi. It also specifies universal suffrage as an eventual goal. Pro-democracy protesters carry a banner which reads  One Country, Two Systems, a cheating for twenty years. Recapture Hong Kong with democracy and self-determination , during a demonstration on the 20th anniversary of the territory's handover from Britain to Chinese rule, in Hong Kong, China July 1, 2017.Bobby YipBut Beijing's refusal to grant full democracy triggered the nearly three months of street protests in 2014 that posed one of the greatest populist challenges to Beijing in decades.  Most Urgent  Protest in Years In the afternoon, tens of thousands gathered in sweltering heat in a sprawling park named after Britain's Queen Victoria, demanding Xi allow universal suffrage. Organizers put the figure at more than 60,000.   Xi shouldn't be interfering in Hong Kong too much,  Peter Lau, a 20-year-old university student, said.  Despite him visiting garrisons and muscle-flexing, Hong Kong people's confidence will never be shaken. Especially for our generation. We should ... fight for our freedom.   Slideshow (22 Images)Some demonstrators marched with yellow umbrellas, a symbol of democratic activism in the city, and held banners denouncing China's Communist  one party rule . Others criticized China's Foreign Ministry which on Friday said the  Joint Declaration  with Britain over Hong Kong, a treaty laying the blueprint over how the city would be ruled after 1997,  no longer has any practical significance . At the end of the rally a simple white banner read:  Cry in grief for 20 years.  [For a link to Reuters handover stories, reut.rs/2sje26J] Xi in the morning addressed a packed hall of mostly pro-Beijing establishment figures, after swearing in Hong Kong's first female leader, Carrie Lam, who was strongly backed by China. Xi hinted that the central government was in favor of Hong Kong introducing  national security  legislation, a controversial issue that brought nearly half a million people to the streets in protest in 2003 and ultimately forced former leader Tung Chee-hwa to step down.  A small group of pro-democracy activists near the venue were roughed up by a group of men who smashed up some props in ugly scuffles. Nine democracy protesters, including student leader Joshua Wong and lawmaker  long hair  Leung Kwok-hung, were bundled into police vans while several pro-China groups remained, cheering loudly and waving red China flags. The activists, in a later statement, said the assailants had been  pro-Beijing triad members .

The former German Chancellor, who died on June 16 at 87, was remembered at a memorial ceremony at the European Parliament as a dedicated European who abhorred war by ex U.S. President Bill Clinton, Russia Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and others.  Helmut Kohl gave us the chance to be involved in something bigger than ourselves, bigger than our terms in office and bigger than our fleeting careers,  Clinton said of the man who was German chancellor from 1982 to 1998 and oversaw German reunification in 1990. The two-hour memorial, in a city that has often changed hands and now lies in France symbolised the role Kohl played in reconciling the two erstwhile enemies France and Germany while driving European integration forward.  He was the architect of the world order,  said Medvedev of Kohl, who skilfully negotiated reunification with communist East Germany with former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.  In Russia, we'll remember him as our friend -- a wise and sincere person.  Afterwards, Kohl's casket was flown by helicopter across the Rhine to his hometown of Ludwigshafen, where his body was later carried in procession before being transported by riverboat to his final place of rest in Speyer. The resting place of many rulers of the Holy Roman Empire, itself a Europe-spanning polity, Speyer Cathedral was seen by Kohl as a symbol of European unity -- a place he showed to contemporary leaders including Gorbachev and Britain's Margaret Thatcher.  Helmut Kohl was a German patriot and a European patriot,  said Juncker, a former Luxembourg prime minister and close friend of Kohl who switched between German and French in his tribute.  We've lost a giant of the post-war era.  Chancellor Angela Merkel, who served as a minister under Kohl in the 1990s but later had a falling out over his role in receiving $1 million in illegal campaign cash donations, remembered Kohl as an at-times controversial figure with numerous enemies.  I could tell you stories as well,  she said.  But all that paled in comparison to his life's achievements.  Merkel said Kohl had changed the lives of millions across all of Europe.  The lives of millions of people would have been a lot different without Helmut Kohl -- including my own life,  the former East German said.  Dear Helmut Kohl, thanks to you I'm standing here today. Thanks for the chance that you made possible for me and many others.  The ceremony concluded with the German national anthem and excerpts from Beethoven's 9th symphony  Ode to Joy , used as the anthem of the European Union. The proposal to hold a European ceremony was enthusiastically advocated by Juncker, and by Kohl's second wife Maike Kohl-Richter, who survives him. His sons, however, will boycott the Cathedral's funeral mass, since their father will not be laid to rest alongside Hannelore Kohl, his wife of decades.

VAR involves two video assistant referees watching the on-pitch action remotely and then drawing the match referee's attention to officiating mistakes. FIFA said the system corrected six game-changing decisions during the Confederations Cup.   Without the VARs, we would have had a different tournament,  Infantino said.  And a tournament which would have been a little less fair.  But Infantino, who said that the system had been tested so far in 74 matches, added that certain aspects needed to be refined.

FIFA President, Gianni Infantino and FIFA’s Chairman of the Referees Committee, Pierluigi Collina during the press conferenceMaxim Shemetov We need to work still on some of the details, on the communication and the speed of the decisions being taken,  he said.  The time needed to make decisions has been criticized. There has also been debate about which circumstances it should be used for as some close calls are decided without consulting the VARs. The use of the system has caused controversy at times, such as during Germany's 3-1 group stage win against Cameroon when referee Wilmar Roldan needed two reviews of an incident to send off the correct Cameroon player. Slideshow (7 Images)Chile were denied a legitimate-looking goal after video review in their 2-0 win against Cameroon on June 18, and it was again used at the end of the same match to overturn a linesman's offside call and award Chile a goal. Former World Cup final referee Pierluigi Collina, the chairman of FIFA's referees committee, said on Saturday that the system was a  very positive tool  to help referees make the right calls and took pressure off them.   We are in a sort of work in progress,  Collina told reporters.  We see the very positive result we had but we are aware that we can improve. This is normal.  Soccer's law-making body IFAB is expected to decide next March whether to allow video assistant referees to become part of the game on a permanent basis.

The 30-year-old Iowa native, who is 0-4 over his last seven starts, has lasted exactly six frames in four consecutive road outings. Hellickson has yet to face the Mets this year but struggled against them in 2016, giving up 21 runs in 24 1/3 innings spread over five starts (1-3).

Meanwhile, FIFA president Gianni Infantino, sitting alongside Mutko at a Confederations Cup press conference, said Russian players were regularly tested in international competition and results always came up negative. A report by Canadian sports lawyer Richard McLaren last year said more than 1,000 Russian athletes competing in summer, winter and paralympic sport were involved in or benefited from an institutional conspiracy to conceal positive doping tests. The report, commissioned by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), said that soccer was among more than 30 sports involved. The scheme included switching and changing samples by opening  tamper-proof  bottles -- using a method devised by the Russian secret service -- and numerous other methods to bypass and cover up drugs tests.  In an answer which lasted nearly nine minutes, Mutko, who is also head of the Russian Football Union (RFU), repeated previous denials concerning alleged doping in Russian football.  If I perform a Russia dance here in front of you, will you stop asking?  he said, speaking through a translator.  I don't know how to react to this,  added Mutko, whose country will host next year's World Cup.

So far it has been successful. We are learning, we are improving, we are continuing the tests.  VAR involves two video assistant referees watching the on-pitch action remotely and then drawing the match referee's attention to officiating mistakes. FIFA said the system corrected six game-changing decisions during the Confederations Cup.   Without the VARs, we would have had a different tournament,  Infantino said.  And a tournament which would have been a little less fair.  But Infantino, who said that the system had been tested so far in 74 matches, added that certain aspects needed to be refined.

The time needed to make decisions has been criticized. There has also been debate about which circumstances it should be used for as some close calls are decided without consulting the VARs. The use of the system has caused controversy at times, such as during Germany's 3-1 group stage win against Cameroon when referee Wilmar Roldan needed two reviews of an incident to send off the correct Cameroon player.

Ukrainian politicians were quick to blame Russia for Tuesday's attack, but a Kremlin spokesman dismissed  unfounded blanket accusations . Cyber security firms are trying to piece together who was behind the computer worm, dubbed NotPetya by some experts, which conked out computers, hit banks, disrupted shipping and shut down a chocolate factory in Australia.

Struggling under the weight of risky property assets, Popular was taken over by Spain's largest bank for the symbolic price of one euro after European authorities stepped in to prevent its collapse. Following a review of the banks assets, the new chair of the board of directors Rodrigo Echenique said in a statement that Popular would seek partners for assets with a total gross book value of about 30 billion euros. He also announced plans to replace board members of companies in which Popular holds stakes. Meanwhile, Popular said it would buy back 51 percent of Aliseda Servicios, which carries out real estate servicing, from the funds Varde Partners and Kennedy Wilson by the third quarter of 2017. The agreed price for the stake was 180 million euros and will entail a capital consumption for Banco Popular of 302 million euros, the bank said.

Trump said the United States was renegotiating what he characterized as a  rough  trade deal with South Korea agreed to five years ago by his predecessor, Barack Obama, and reiterated that an era of  strategic patience  over North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programs had ended.  Together we are facing the threat of the reckless and brutal regime in North Korea,  Trump said as he stood alongside Moon in the White House Rose Garden.  The nuclear and ballistic missile programs of that regime require a determined response.  Despite the tough rhetoric, it remains unclear how Trump will find a way forward on North Korea, which is working to develop a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the United States. U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has warned the consequences of any military solution would be  tragic on an unbelievable scale.  Trump had pinned his hopes on persuading China, North Korea's neighbor and main trading partner, to do more to rein in Pyongyang, although he has lately grown frustrated that Beijing has not taken stronger action.  Trump called on regional powers to implement sanctions and demand North Korea  choose a better path and do it quickly.  Moon, who warned of a  stern response  to any provocations, urged Pyongyang to return promptly to talks.  Our two leaders will employ both sanctions and dialogue in a phased and comprehensive approach,  Moon said of South Korea and the United States. Trump and Moon have said they are open to renewed dialogue with North Korea but only under circumstances that would lead to Pyongyang giving up its weapons programs. Moon told an event at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank that moves by North Korea that could create conditions for dialogue could include a freeze on its nuclear and missile tests, or the release of three Americans it is holding in the country. To be successful, talks would have to involve North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and have as their ultimate aim the complete dismantling of North Korea's nuclear program, he added.    Trump sought to woo China since a summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping in April but the honeymoon period appears to be over. On Thursday, the United States targeted a Chinese bank and sanctioned Chinese individuals and a firm for dealing with North Korea and approved a $1.42 billion arms deal with Taiwan - decisions that angered Beijing. Steel and Autos U.S. President Donald Trump  (R) greets South Korean President Moon Jae-in prior to delivering a joint statement from the Rose Garden of the White House in Washington, U.S., June 30, 2017.Jim BourgSouth Korea is a long-standing American ally but Trump has spoken harshly about U.S. trade imbalances and threatened to tear up the bilateral trade pact.  We will do more to remove barriers to reciprocal trade and market access,  Trump said, adding that the two leaders had talked about the thorny trade areas of steel and autos. Trump said he was encouraged by Moon's assurances that he would seek a level playing field for American workers and businesses, particularly automakers. A joint statement said the two sides had agreed to work together to reduce over supply of basic materials such as steel and non-tariff barriers. It also said Trump had accepted an invitation from Moon to visit South Korea this year.  Bonnie Glaser, senior adviser for Asia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank, said it was unwise for Trump to air the trade issue so publicly. Slideshow (8 Images) Public complaints by Trump about unfair trade and inadequate defense spending provide opportunities for China and North Korea to drive a wedge between the allies,  she said. Trump also emphasized the need to ensure equitable sharing of costs for defense, returning to a theme he raised during his campaign and brought up with other allies, including NATO countries and Japan. A senior U.S. official said in a briefing before the president's meeting with Moon that South Korea was in many respects a  model ally,  given its spending of 2.7 percent of GDP on defense and Moon's plan to grow capabilities.  We shouldn't view South Korea as somehow laggard on that front,  the official said on condition of anonymity. The U.S. goods trade deficit with South Korea has more than doubled since the U.S.-Korea free trade pact known as KORUS took effect in 2012. The agreement was forecast to boost U.S. exports by $10 billion a year, but in 2016 they were $3 billion lower than in 2011. At the start of Friday's talks, U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said the largest component of the deficit was automotive trade and many non-tariff barriers to U.S. auto exports to South Korea remained.  I think the way to address it is to deal product by product with what we can do to change the export side and what we can do to reduce the bad imports side,  he said. Ross said later on Friday that some progress had been made in the talks. The current pact was agreed to despite protests by supporters of Moon, who was then in opposition. But analysts have suggested that given the need to preserve a unified front in the face of a hostile North Korea, there could be compromise on both sides to resolve issues.

The Goods and Services Tax (GST), India's biggest tax reform in the 70 years since independence from British colonial rule, unifies the $2 trillion economy and 1.3 billion people into one of the world's biggest common markets. Maruti Suzuki Ltd (MRTI.NS), India's biggest carmaker by sales, dropped prices on some models by up to 3 percent, passing the  entire benefit of GST rates  to customers. Maruti, however, said prices of two mild hybrid models had increased under the GST regime, following withdrawal of tax concessions.  Tata Motors' luxury British arm, Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), has reduced prices for all cars manufactured in India by up to 7 percent, a spokeswoman for the company told Reuters. Hypermarket Big Bazaar, owned by Future Retail Ltd (FRTL.NS), announced discounts of 2 percent to 22 percent on groceries and household supplies across its stores in 26 states. Fashion portal Myntra, part of India's biggest online retailer Flipkart, was also offering GST discounts.

Barnes hit a grand slam in the first and a three-run homer in the sixth as the Los Angeles Dodgers routed the San Diego Padres 10-4 to finish the greatest June in franchise history. But the memory everyone will take from this game is the sight of the two managers -- Dave Roberts of the Dodgers and Andy Green of the Padres -- charging each other to trigger a benches-clearing face-off between the first and second innings. Both were ejected, although no players were. And it all apparently started with Dodgers starting pitcher Alex Wood making a verbal threat to San Diego's Jose Pirela, who doesn't understand enough English to know what Wood said.  They were threatening to hit my guy for stealing signs,  said Green.  You don't threaten another player. Wood stood on the mound and made an outright threat to Pirela.  That got Green's blood boiling. Wood's threats led plate umpire Greg Gibson to warn both teams. And after the end of the first, Gibson summoned both managers to cool the situation. It backfired. Green had some choice things to say about Wood. Roberts responded in defense of his pitcher and it was game on. The two managers actually tried to get at each other. As the discussion grew more heated, Roberts said something to Green as the Padres manager was being led away by another member of the umpiring crew. Green responded and Roberts charged him, bumping into the San Diego manager and the umpire as players from both teams rushed the field, separated the managers and stood face-to-face between home plate and the Padres dugout. Related CoveragePreview: Dodgers at PadresLos Angeles Dodgers - PlayerWatchSan Diego Padres - PlayerWatch I probably could have handled it differently,  said Roberts, who was raised in San Diego County and was both a player and a coach with the Padres and actually sought the managerial job before Green was hired -- and he was subsequently hired by the Dodgers.  I probably got too emotional. I didn't appreciate what Green said about my player.   Dave probably reacted to the last comment I made,  said Green, who thought the threat by Wood demanded a stronger response from the umpiring crew. But the bottom line was that Pirela had no idea he was being threatened by Wood. The 27-year-old Venezuelan speaks minimal English. He spoke Friday night through an interpreter.  I didn't know what he said,  said Pirela, who was on second with a leadoff double in the bottom of the first.  I wasn't stealing signs.  Actually, Wood was accusing Pirela of signaling pitch location to his teammates.  At first, I thought he might be mad at himself for giving up a double,  said Pirela.  I didn't understand what he was saying.  Asked if he was stealing signs, Pirela replied  No.  But second base umpire D.J. Reyburn heard the threat. And Wood repeated the threat to Gibson when the plate umpire went to the mound to change balls.  Right then, my hands are tied,  said Gibson, who then issued the warning.  The managers wanted to discuss it right then. I'm not going to discuss it then. I wanted to get the game moving. Maybe everybody forgets about it.  But at the end of the first, both managers simultaneously approached Gibson.  It was a strange situation,  said Gibson.  I've never been a part of anything like this. For about the first 30 seconds, it was a civil conversation. Then it was between those two. Green took exception to his team being warned. And then Andy said something to Dave and it escalated from there. Roberts was aggressive and went after Andy.  No players were ejected. On the field, the Dodgers scored seven runs off Clayton Richard in 4 1/3 innings while Wood ran his record to 9-0 -- becoming the first Dodger pitcher to start a season 9-0 since Rick Rhoden in 1976. The win gave the National League West-leading Dodgers a 21-7 record in June. The 21 wins tied a franchise record for June -- with the 1952 and 1954 Brooklyn Dodgers and 1973 Los Angeles edition -- and the .750 winning percentage is a franchise record for June. The win also continued the Dodgers' domination of their Southern California division rivals. The Dodgers are 6-1 against the Padres this season and 31-14 against San Diego since the start of the 2015 season. The game was essentially over after six hitters. Richard retired the first two hitters he faced before Justin Turner singled. Richard then walked Cody Bellinger and Logan Forsythe before Barnes drove a fastball 387 feet into the left field stands for the first grand slam of his career. It was the first of three homers hit by the Dodgers. Turner hit a 403-foot, two-run homer off Richard in the fourth to make it 6-0. And Barnes drove in three runs with his second homer, a 414-foot drive off reliever Jose Valdez, in the sixth to make it 10-1. Richard gave up seven runs on nine hits and four walks in 4 1/3 innings. The left-handed Wood, meanwhile, allowed one run on two hits and three walks over six innings.

In Washington state, the $43.7 billion two-year operating budget, which includes a $5.2 billion revenue increase paid for in part with new taxes, was approved by both chambers of the legislature earlier on Friday. Governor Jay Inslee, a Democrat, signed the spending bill before midnight, preventing the closure of many state agencies and the layoff of thousands of employees. He called the budget  a transformational investment in the future of our state  in a message on Twitter.  Apart from funding government operations, the budget adds about $1.8 billion in new funding for K-12 public schools over the next two years and promises $7.3 billion total over four years, according to a summary of the legislation.  It was not immediately clear whether the education funding increase would satisfy a 2012 order by the state's Supreme Court that found the state was failing to fully fund basic education in violation of its own constitution. The court gave lawmakers a deadline - the first day of school in 2018 - to lay out a credible plan to fix the problem.

But after giving up a leadoff homer to rookie Matt Olson in the bottom of the ninth inning, Foltynewicz still savored a 3-1 victory, not the mention the standing ovation he received from a large contingent of fans behind the Braves' dugout as he walked off the field.  It was a very cool feeling,  Foltynewicz said.  It's something I'll never forget.  Foltynewicz (6-5) struck out eight, walked four and threw a career-high 119 pitches in eight innings, giving up one run and one hit. He extended his winning streak to three games. Entering the game, Foltynewicz hadn't pitched more than seven innings in an outing this season. He matched his career high of eight innings set May 14, 2016, in a 5-0 victory at Kauffman Stadium. Olson hit a 3-2 fastball high and deep into the right field seats, ending Foltynewicz's no-hit bid and his night.

At the end of the day, it's 3-2 and I got to come at you with the fastball and he's ready for it.  The fourth time through the lineup it gets a little tougher. They start seeing you a little better. You just got to tip your hat to him. He put the bat on the ball and he put it out of the park.  Olson's homer was his fourth of the season.  I was just trying to have a good at-bat, the way he was throwing against us,  said Olson, a native of Atlanta.  Hitting a home run to break up the no-hitter was just the cherry on top. I was seeing him fairly well all night and just missing. He had a lot of life on his fastball.  Jed Lowrie greeted former A's reliever Jim Johnson with a double to left, but Johnson struck out the next three batters he faced for his 17th save of the season.

He's been consistent with his stuff,  A's managers Bob Melvin said of Gray.  Finally got results tonight. We just didn't score any runs for him.  The Braves grabbed a 1-0 lead in the third on doubles by Johan Camargo and Dansby Swanson. They extended their lead to 3-0 in the ninth, scoring twice off reliever Sean Doolittle. Swanson worked a leadoff walk and Ender Inciarte bunted into a forceout, but he stole second and scored on Brandon Phillips' single to right. Phillips took second on the throw home and scored from third on Matt Kemp's one-out single. Foltynewicz retired the first 12 batters he faced in order before issuing a leadoff walk to Khris Davis in the fifth. He retired the next three A's hitters in order, including Rajai Davis on a line drive to left fielder Danny Santana, who made a nice play, going back on the ball.  Off the bat I was like, 'That's a double, maybe even a triple,' and then he got there,  Braves catcher Tyler Flowers said of Santana.  He covers a lot of darn ground out there.  Foltynewicz issued two walks in the sixth but also struck out two, and the A's didn't get a runner past second base. Foltynewicz kept the A's off-balance with a mixture of mid-to-high 90s heat and sharp breaking balls.  Been through a lot with that kid the past couple of years,  Braves manager Brian Snitker said.

With the exception of the ultra-conservative Aceh province, homosexuality is legal in Indonesia. But police raids on the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community have risen in the world's most populous Muslim country. Anwar Abbas of Muhammadiyah, an organization that has around 30 million members, said the government should revoke Starbucks' operating license as the company's support for the LGBT community is  not in line  with the nation's ideology.  If Starbucks only does business, then fine. But don't bring ideology here,  Abbas told Reuters by phone on Saturday.  PT Sari Coffee Indonesia, which holds the license to run the Starbucks chain, is a legal entity that  always obeys the prevailing regulations and appreciates the cultural values in Indonesia , an executive at its parent company said.  We also value the religious background of our customers and employees,  Fetty Kwartati, a director at PT MAP Boga Adiperkasa Tbk, said in a text message. Indonesia's reputation for tolerance and pluralism is already under scrutiny after Jakarta Governor Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, an ethnic-Chinese Christian, was sentenced in May to two years in prison for blasphemy in a trial that came after mass Islamist-led rallies last year. Asked why he had taken a stand against Starbucks, Abbas  said he was informed in a chat group about a pro-LGBT comment made by the company's senior executive, Howard Schultz. Schultz is now chairman of Starbucks after stepping down from his previous role as chief executive. Forbes reported that when a Starbucks shareholder complained in 2013 that the company had lost customers because of its support for gay marriage, Schultz said it embraces diversity and that  not every decision is an economic decision . (bit.ly/2swGTQB)  If you feel, respectfully, that you can get a higher return than the 38 percent you got last year, it's a free country. You can sell your shares in Starbucks and buy shares in another company,  Schultz was reported as saying at that time. A video of the comment was also posted on YouTube. Starbucks customer Annisa Meidiana, who is a Muslim, said she would not stop buying coffee there because of the call for the boycott.  Islam condemns LGBT. It's a sin,  the 22-year-old university student said outside Jakarta.  But it doesn't matter to me. For me, being an LGBT is a human right.

Gray, coming back from a foot injury suffered in April, pitched the Rockies to one of their season's most important wins Friday night he pitched six solid innings in a 6-3 victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks.  Our guys are calm,  Colorado manager Bud Black said.  Even through this last week.  We just haven't hit enough. We haven't pitched well enough. We've had a couple games where we've been in position to win and we didn't late. But don't worry about our players and their resolve and what they're all about.  Gray (1-0) was the key. The Rockies' Opening Day starter hadn't taken the mound since April 13 at San Francisco, where he suffered a broken bone in his left foot. He allowed two runs and seven hits. He struck out 10 and walked one.  What I saw today was a repeatable delivery that he maintained, which is great,  Black said. Gray said he tried to slow the game down.

I think I've taken another step in my career recently. And I just want to go out there and be a pitcher and make pitches and get outs. I'm going to battle.  Charlie Blackmon and Raimel Tapia hit solo homers for the Rockies (48-34). Tapia's home run was the first of his career. His 2-for-4, two-RBI night also included a double.

I thought he was able to catch a little wind in the fourth and fifth innings,  Arizona manager Torey Lovullo said of Ray's long outing.  Things really started to come together for him and he gave everything he could  Ray said he was  just missing  the strike zone.  Just barely,  he said.  It was tough. I got behind in counts and paid for it.  Chris Owings hit two solo homers, running his season total to 11, for Arizona. The Diamondbacks now have lost three straight. This is the first time this season they've lost three consecutive games at home. The Rockies' eight-game losing streak started with two blowouts by the Diamondbacks last week in Denver. The Rockies made it 5-2 in the seventh on a triple by Nolan Arenado and a groundout by Mark Reynolds. In the eighth, Colorado added a sixth run when Tapia doubled and eventually scored on a wild pitch by Jorge De La Rosa. Owings hit a solo shot off Mike Dunn in the eighth to cut the lead to 6-3. Greg Holland pitched a scoreless ninth for his 26th save. Blackmon led off the game by lining a home run over the right-field fence. It was Blackmon's third leadoff homer of the season and 25th of his career. The Rockies left the bases loaded when Ray got Tapia to ground out. The Diamondbacks evened the score at 1 in the bottom of the first when Jake Lamb doubled home Gregor Blanco, who singled. The Rockies took a 3-1 lead in the third when a Tapia ground ball drove home Mark Reynolds and Ryan Hanigan singled home Trevor Story. Owings lined his 10th homer into the left-field seats, off Gray in the fourth, to cut the Rockies' lead to 3-2. Tapia hit a solo homer in the sixth off Ray to make it 4-2 Rockies.

But he couldn't get the ball into good spots in the fifth.  One thing with Parker, he was pitching ahead in the count in his good games, and tonight he reversed that. He had to work back into counts a lot of those guys swung the bats well.  Cano hit his second homer in the seventh inning, a two-run shot off Angels reliever Yusmeiro Petit. Zunino's one-out home run in the third inning off Bridwell gave the Mariners a 1-0 lead before they broke the game open in the fifth. Jarrod Dyson led off the inning with a double and scored on a double by Jean Segura. After Gamel singled, Cano came up with the big hit, a three-run homer, his 15th home run of the season, that made it 5-0. Meanwhile, Miranda didn't allow a hit until Kole Calhoun led off the fourth inning with a bloop single. But Calhoun was immediately erased when Albert Pujols grounded into a double play. Andrelton Simmons led off the fifth with a double for the Angels' second hit and moved to third on a groundout but was left stranded.  We're turning the page on this one,  Angels manager Mike Scioscia said. NOTES: The Angels acquired INF/OF Nick Franklin from the Milwaukee Brewers in a trade for a player to be named or cash considerations. Franklin, who is expected to be activated to the roster Saturday, hit .195 with two homers and 10 RBIs in 53 games for Milwaukee this season. ... Angels RHP Brooks Pounders was called up from Triple-A Salt Lake, taking the spot of LHP Jose Alvarez, who was optioned to Salt Lake. Alvarez, who was the only lefty in the bullpen, was 0-3 with a 5.40 ERA in a staff-high 40 games. ... Mariners DH Nelson Cruz went 1-for-5 with a double, extending his homerless streak to 21 games. His last home run came June 4, but his 14 homers trail only 2B Robinson Cano (16) for the team lead. Despite the home run drought, Cruz still ranks second in the American League with 59 RBIs. ... Mariners LF Ben Gamel went 4-for-5, closing out June with a .393 average (42-for-107), second best in the majors for the month and tops in the American League.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-mariners-angels-writethru-idUSMTZED71EBTY3D"},

Cabrera drove in two runs with a game-ending double just inside the first-base line as the Chicago White Sox rallied with three runs in the bottom of the ninth inning to beat the Texas Rangers 8-7 on Friday night. The White Sox's stocky left fielder bounced a 2-1 pitch from closer Matt Bush just inside the bag. The Rangers challenged if the ball was fair, but the call by first-base umpire Adrian Johnson was upheld.  I knew it was a fair ball when the umpire called it fair,  Cabrera said through an interpreter.  I was waiting for him to make that call.  With Texas leading 7-5, Bush gave up singles to Adam Engel, Willy Garcia and Alen Hanson before Cabrera's game-winning hit with one out.  We have confidence in ourselves,  Cabrera said.  We know if we do our best, we will have a very good chance to win the game, and we did.  It was Cabrera's 14th game-winning, walk-off late appearance since 2009. And manager Rick Renteria wasn't surprised Cabrera finished the job.  He's a professional hitter, who in certain situations just kind of seems to rise to the occasion,  Renteria said.  That was just another example of it.  Bush (2-4) blew his fifth save in 15 chances and the Rangers lost their third straight. Related CoveragePreview: Rangers at White SoxTexas Rangers - PlayerWatchChicago White Sox - PlayerWatch It wasn't a matter of not having it,  Bush said.  I just struggled throwing my fastball up to put a guy away.  I couldn't locate my heater up in the zone. It sucks. It's terrible. I hate it.  Chicago's Todd Frazier hit two solo homers and Jose Abreu launched one off Austin Bibens-Dirkx. The 32-year-old right-hander pitched into the sixth inning but failed to win his fourth straight decision in his fifth career major-league start. Anthony Swarzak (4-2) struck out the side in the ninth to help the White Sox win their second straight. Rougned Odor hit a two-run homer and Joey Gallo added a solo shot for Texas. Frazier hit his 14th and 15th homers, going deep twice in a game for the eighth time in his career. Abreu's home run was his 14th but the first this season at home.  When he hit it, we were talking about getting the baseball because everybody had been talking about how it was his first one at home,  Renteria said.  Just in general I thought everybody did a nice job of picking each other up and continue to play the game through nine innings.  Bibens-Dirkx went 5 2/3 innings and allowed four runs and eight hits before being replaced by Jose Leclerc. Chicago starter Mike Pelfrey lasted five innings, giving up five runs, eight hits and two walks. Shin-Soo Choo had three hits and drove in two runs with a single in a four-run fourth for the Rangers. Elvis Andrus had an RBI as Texas added two runs in the sixth. Gallo hit his team-leading 21st homer but entered with just a .192 average and an MLB-leading 107 strikeouts. White Sox DH Kevan Smith had three hits and an RBI. Yolmer Sanchez had two hits and drove in a run. The first three Texas hitters reached to load the bases, but Pelfrey wriggled out of the jam with none scoring. Choo and Andrus each singled before Pelfrey hit Nomar Mazara with a pitch. But the 6-foot-7 right-hander struck out Adrian Beltre and Odor grounded into a double play. The White Sox jumped ahead 2-0 in the bottom half on back-to-back solo shots to left field by Abreu and Frazier. It was the sixth time this season that Chicago hitters went deep consecutively. Gallo launched a drive more than 400 feet into the left-center field bleachers on the first pitch of the third to cut it to 2-1. The Rangers scored four runs in the fourth to jump ahead 5-2. Beltre walked to lead off and Odor homered to right. With one out, Jonathan Lucroy and Mike Napoli singled and advanced to second and third on Gallo's groundout. Both runners scored on Choo's single up the middle. Frazier cracked his second homer of the night on a full-count pitch to start the bottom of the fourth and cut it to 5-3. His liner landed in the first row of the left-center bleachers. Andrus' single to left scored Carlos Gomez in the sixth, then Mike Napoli came home on Cabrera's error to make it 7-3. NOTES: Slumping Chicago rookie INF Tim Anderson and rookie INF/DH Matt Davidson got the night off. Anderson entered with just one hit in his last six games (2-for-21) and Davidson was 1-for-20 with 13 strikeouts in his last five games. ... Texas manager Jeff Banister said he was concerned about his team's inability to manufacture runs and over-reliance on the home run. The Rangers entered with an American League-worst .238 team batting average.  Somewhere along the way you've got to hit some multi-point home runs,  Banister said.  Balanced offense, in my opinion, is still the best. ","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-rangers-whitesox-writethru-idUSMTZED71E9SN2G"},

Their march would get a lot easier if right-hander Jacob deGrom could pitch every day. DeGrom won his fourth straight start Friday night, when he allowed just three hits over seven innings as the Mets edged the Philadelphia Phillies 2-1 at Citi Field. The Mets (37-42) have won six of seven -- a stretch that began immediately after they were outscored 36-11 in enduring a four-game sweep at the hands of the Los Angeles Dodgers -- to at least regain a pulse in the National League playoff race.  I think we have to be a little bit more optimistic after the last six days than we were coming out of Los Angeles,  Mets general manager Sandy Alderson said Friday afternoon. Related CoveragePreview: Phillies at MetsNew York Mets - PlayerWatchThe Mets are 9 1/2 games behind the Washington Nationals in the NL East and 9 1/2 games behind Colorado in the race for the second wild card.  Going into L.A. and getting our teeth kicked in was kind of a wakeup call,  said deGrom, who was the only Mets starter not to face the Dodgers in last week's series.  We're running out of time. I think everybody's kind of on the same page. We know we've got a good team. Just a matter of going out there and playing.  DeGrom, who allowed one fluke run, walked one and struck out 12 in improving to 7-3, might be playing himself right on to the NL All-Star team. The 29-year-old has pitched at least seven innings and allowed one run or fewer in each of the last four starts, a stretch in which he's given up three runs while striking out 31 and walking eight over 32 innings.  He's in a groove, for sure,  Mets manager Terry Collins said. Overall this season, deGrom has pitched seven innings while giving up one run or less six times in 16 starts. Only five other pitchers have done that: Dodgers ace Clayton Kershaw (eight such starts) and the trio of the Nationals' Max Scherzer, Kansas City's Jason Vargas and Minnesota's Ervin Santana (six such starts apiece).  That's what I want to go out there and do,  deGrom said.  That's the goal and prepare in between each start to do that. Right now, it's paying off.  DeGrom's hard work looked as if it might pay off with a no-hitter when he limited Philadelphia to just one walk in the first 4 2/3 innings before Phillies catcher Andrew Knapp was credited with a triple after Mets center fielder Curtis Granderson lost Knapp's routine fly ball in the dusk settling above Citi Field. Granderson gestured helplessly as the ball landed far behind him.  (Knapp) ran hard from the time he hit that ball in the air and that's why he got a triple out of that,  Phillies manager Pete Mackanin said.  He ran hard the whole way and got himself to third base and that was nice to see.  Four pitchers after Knapp's triple, Ty Kelly singled past a drawn-in infield to score Knapp and pull the Phillies within 2-1. But deGrom and a trio of relievers combined to retire 13 of the final 15 batters they faced, with Addison Reed earning his 13th save with a perfect seven-pitch ninth inning. Granderson had an RBI single in the second for the Mets, who scored the decisive run in the fourth when Jose Reyes tripled with one out and trotted home on Travis d'Arnaud's single. Knapp walked and stole a base for the Phillies (26-52), who were trying for just their third three-game winning streak of the season. Philadelphia's top five batters Friday were 0-for-19.  Tough to lose that game,  Mackanin said.  Not one of our first five hitters got a hit.  Rookie Ben Lively (1-3) took the loss after allowing two runs on five hits and four walks while striking out two over 6 1/3 innings. NOTES: Mets 1B Lucas Duda was scratched a little less than two hours before game time due to the stomach ailment that sidelined him the previous two games. ... Mets OF Michael Conforto (left hand) missed his fourth straight game. Conforto underwent further testing Friday afternoon, and general manager Sandy Alderson said Conforto could be placed on the disabled list Saturday, when RHP Zack Wheeler is scheduled to be activated. ...

First curtain call of my career,  Vogt said.  It was pretty cool. You don't have too many multi-homer games in Oakland unless you are (former Milwaukee and current Oakland slugger) Khris Davis.  Vogt, claimed off waivers last weekend from Oakland, put the Brewers on the board with a solo home run in the fifth inning and gave them the lead with a two-run shot in the seventh as the Brewers set a franchise record for home runs in a month with 49. But more important, Milwaukee increased its lead over the second-place Chicago Cubs in the National League Central to two games.  I'm just excited we won,  Vogt said.  I'm so happy to be here, to be in first place, to play on a winning team to just have a chance to win every night and be pushing for the playoff run. To contribute is awesome. I would have never conjured that up. It was fun.  Related CoveragePreview: Marlins at BrewersMiami Marlins - PlayerWatchMilwaukee Brewers - PlayerWatchBrewers right-hander Matt Garza went five innings and held the Marlins to two runs and six hits with one walk and three strikeouts. Edinson Volquez worked six innings for Miami and allowed one run and three hits. He walked two struck out four.  That's a dangerous club over there,  Marlins manager Don Mattingly said.  If you get a bunch of runners out there, they can put a lot of pressure on you. He kept his walks down. I thought he used his off-speed well. He had good stuff tonight. He was good.  A scoreless game through four innings, Miami broke through in the fifth on an RBI double from JT Riddle. He made it 2-0 later the inning, scoring when Garza flubbed a sacrifice bunt by Dee Gordon and couldn't make a short toss home. Domingo Santana drew a leadoff walk to put the winning run aboard against David Phelps (2-4) in the seventh. After Hernan Perez struck out, Vogt smashed a 1-2 fastball to center, putting Milwaukee ahead.  I was trying to get a fastball up and it put it right down the middle,  Phelps said. Milwaukee's bullpen was in lockdown mode from there. Carlos Torres (4-4) pitched two scoreless innings and Jacob Barnes struck out two in the eighth to bridge the gap to closer Corey Knebel. Knebel walked leadoff batter J.T. Realmuto in the ninth and almost gave up the lead on Derek Dietrich's double to left. But Ryan Braun made a spot-on throw to Orlando Arcia, who rifled the ball to Vogt behind the plate in time to put the tag on Realmuto.  That was the biggest play of the game, obviously,  Vogt said.  Everything had to go perfect and it did. Those two guys made to two perfect throws. Arcia's throw was perfect for me to slap the tag on him real quick. It was an already perfect play.  Mattingly challenged the call, but after a 58-second review, it was confirmed and Knebel punched out two more batters to set an MLB record for consecutive games with a strikeout to start the season for a reliever with 40, as well as earn his 13th save.  Forty straight appearances with a strikeout is unbelievable,  Brewers manager Craig Counsell said.  He should be very proud of it for sure.

If we don't score right there in that inning or only score one, it completely changed the entire ballgame from that point on. Especially when you got two aces on the mound like tonight, that's usually what decides the winner, is the team that capitalizes on mistakes.  Mike Moustakas blasted his team-leading 21st home run in the sixth. Jermaine Dye holds the Royals' record with 22 home runs in 2000 before the All-Star break. Alex Gordon drove in the final two Kansas City runs with sacrifice flies. Santana (10-5) allowed seven runs (five earned) and eight hits in 5 1/3 innings. Santana's errant throw on a potential double-play grounder paved the way for the five-run fourth inning. Jorge Bonifacio led off the inning with a single to right field, the first Kansas City hit. Lorenzo Cain hit a comebacker, but Santana tossed the ball past second baseman Brian Dozier and into center field. Santana was visibly upset with his error and Hosmer hit his next pitch for an opposite-field, three-run homer just inside the left-field foul pole. There was a crew chief challenge to make sure it was fair, but after a one-minute and 51-second delay the call on the field was upheld. The Royals tacked on two runs before the inning ended with Alcides Escobar and Whit Merrifield singling in the other runs.  If you ask my opinion, I think the game turned on one play, and that was the comebacker,  Twins manager Paul Molitor said.  You have a chance to get a couple outs and nobody on base and it turned into a big rally because we didn't execute.  It's one of those throws you make from the side of the mound and your feet land maybe a little differently than on flat ground and it seemed like the ball took off on him. He was good early, couldn't stop the bleeding there. They put up a big number and we generated almost nothing off of their guy.  The Twins scored first in the third inning. Vargas walked Max Kepler and Joe Mauer. Miguel Sano's two-out single scored Kepler. The Twins threatened in the fifth after Byron Buxton walked and Dozier singled. Vargas retired Mauer on a fly ball to center and Sano on a comebacker to end the inning.

LOUIS -- When a sinkerball pitcher earns 17 outs via grounders, odds are he probably had a good game. Mike Leake certainly did Friday night, snapping a six-start streak without a win as he worked eight strong innings in the St. Louis Cardinals' 8-1 rout of the Washington Nationals at Busch Stadium. In upping his record to 6-6, Leake gave up five hits and a run, walking three and striking out four. He induced four double-play balls and threw just 93 pitches in his first victory since May 24 at the Los Angeles Dodgers.  Going into the game, you know you're going to get ground balls,  St. Louis shortstop Paul DeJong said.  You've got to make plays. We're trying to help out our pitcher and the double plays helped.  Although Washington (47-33) managed eight baserunners against him, Leake faced just three batters over the minimum. He also helped his cause by picking Michael Taylor off first before Bryce Harper could bat in the third inning of a scoreless game. Related CoveragePreview: Nationals at CardinalsWashington Nationals - PlayerWatchSt. Louis Cardinals - PlayerWatchNationals manager Dusty Baker, who managed Leake for the first four years of his career in Cincinnati, wasn't surprised by his performance.  I hate to face a pitcher that's one game under .500 because they always pitch their best to get back to .500,  Baker said.  He's a good pitcher. I had him and he knows how to pitch.  While Leake cruised, Washington starter Tanner Roark struggled again, undone this time by an utter inability to make acquaintance with the strike zone. Roark (6-6) walked a career-high five and threw a whopping 85 pitches in three innings, giving up four hits and three runs while fanning two. Roark made it through the first two innings despite three walks, but leadoff passes to Tommy Pham and Stephen Piscotty in the third finally led to trouble. After Jedd Gyorko's infield hit filled the bases, Yadier Molina grounded a two-run single up the middle. Two outs later, Greg Garcia added an RBI single to left-center for a 3-0 advantage.  Falling behind every single hitter was the source of everything,  Roark said.  My fastball command, which is my bread and butter, just wasn't there tonight. Five walks is never, ever good.  So bad, in fact, that Roark was pulled before the bottom of the fourth for reliever Jacob Turner. St. Louis pounced on him for five quick runs to end any suspense before the game was official. Gyorko rifled a ground-rule double to right-center that scored Matt Carpenter. Molina drilled another two-run single through a drawn-in infield. DeJong capped the outburst with his sixth homer, a 426-foot blast to the seats in left-center.  I felt like it was a matter of time,  Cardinals manager Mike Matheny said of his offense.  We were grinding out competitive at-bats, making (Roark) work real hard. It was one good at-bat after another.  Pham, Gyorko, Molina and Garcia each finished with two hits in St. Louis' 11-hit attack. It was the third straight win for the Cardinals (38-41), who have captured five of their last six games and remain 3 1/2 games behind first-place Milwaukee in the National League Central. Matheny has maintained as his team has struggled to find any kind of traction since mid-May that it was capable of playing crisp, clean baseball. While six games is clearly a small sample size, he's seen enough to believe St. Louis is over a 12-25 skid that left it at seven games under .500 less than a week ago.  It's great to talk about it,  he said,  but now you're seeing all the components. We hit some ruts and it put some doubt in everyone, but playing like this gives you an extra bit of confidence. It sets the tempo for what it needs to be going forward.  NOTES: St. Louis announced Friday that general manager John Mozeliak is being promoted to president of baseball operations. Michael Girsch is the new GM and vice-president. Both signed contracts through 2020. ... Cardinals LHP Zach Duke (left elbow surgery) started a rehab assignment Friday at the team's Gulf Coast League affiliate, pitching an inning and allowing a hit while fanning one. ... Washington officially put SS Trea Turner (broken wrist) on the 10-day DL and recalled INF Adrian Sanchez from Triple-A Syracuse. The Nationals also transferred LHP Sammy Solis (left elbow inflammation), currently on a rehab stint at Syracuse, to the 60-day DL.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-nationals-cardinals-writethru-idUSMTZED71E6SCXR"},

That measure, being pushed by Governor Chris Christie in a search for money to fund drug addiction services, was tied to a budget bill that passed the Senate on Thursday but has not gained enough support to clear the Assembly. During the shutdown, state police, prisons, child welfare services, NJ Transit and other health and safety operations will continue to function, Christie said in an executive order signed in Trenton just before midnight. But all state parks will be closed, an unwelcome prospect for residents celebrating the Fourth of July holiday on Tuesday. A number of other state services, including obtaining birth and marriage certificates, will halt. The shutdown could be short-lived, however, as Christie called a special legislative session for 11 a.m. ET on Saturday to continue working on a deal. At issue is a push by the governor to force the non-profit insurer Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield to spend some of its billions in reserves on public health services or return money to subscribers. Assembly Speaker Vincent Prieto, a Democrat, said the Horizon plan was  bad public policy  that was introduced at the last minute and should not be considered until after a budget passed.  None of this should be tied to the budget,  he said during a televised afternoon press conference.  The budget is a document that already has been vetted ... nothing should be held hostage.  The governor, however, blamed Prieto for the impasse, saying there should be a  change in transparency  at Horizon. Christie, who has the lowest approval rating of any governor in New Jersey's history, said he would strip from the budget about $150 million in school funding and other items previously agreed with Democrats unless the Assembly passed the Horizon bill. All 80 of the Assembly's seats are up for re-election in November, when New Jersey will also elect a new governor to replace Christie, who is in his eighth and final year as governor. The new governor will inherit the state's gaping public pension shortfall, which has contributed to 11 credit downgrades during Christie's tenure. New Jersey's credit rating is now the second lowest in the United States, above only Illinois.

Wie, who ended the second round three strokes behind halfway leaders Kim Sei-young and Danielle Kang at Olympia Fields on Friday, had trouble deciding what to hit for her second shot at the final hole, after slicing her tee shot into deep rough. “I think it’ll be plenty,” she said to her caddie about the club of choice, their conversation audible to nearby spectators including her father. “I’m going to hit down on it. It’ll come out hot.” After two practice swings, Wie took an almighty slash at her ball, but it did not come out hot. It found a bunker in front of the green, leading to a closing bogey. Asked what clubs she had been torn between hitting, Wie was vague. “Just had a really bad lie. Just wanted to make sure I got it out there,” she said. Pressed on what she had hit, Wie smiled and finally spilled the beans. “An 11-wood,” she said, breaking into raucous laughter. “I love it. It’s so easy to hit.

The gunman, wearing a white medical lab coat, stalked two floors of the Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Center, in the New York borough of the Bronx, and tried to set himself on fire before police searching the building found him dead of a self-inflicted gunshot, Police Commissioner James O'Neill said. One female physician was shot to death, and six other people were wounded, five seriously, including one who was shot in the leg, O'Neill said at a news conference.  Mayor Bill de Blasio characterized the shooting as an  isolated incident  that appeared to be  a workplace-related matter.  He said that it was  not an act of terrorism.    One doctor is dead, and there are several doctors who are fighting for their lives right now amongst those who are wounded,  de Blasio told reporters.  This is a horrific situation unfolding in the middle of a place that people associate with care and comfort.  O'Neill said the gunman was armed with an assault rifle. Neither the mayor nor police immediately identified the suspect or any of the victims. O'Neill said the gunman was a former employee of the 972-bed hospital. Bronx Borough President Ruben Diaz, in an interview with WABC News, identified the gunman as Dr. Henry Bello and said he had been fired by the hospital. Other media reports said Bello was 45 years of age. The New York Times and the New York Daily News reported, citing unnamed sources, that Bello had resigned from the hospital rather than face termination over accusations of sexual harassment. From Nigeria to Caribbean Medical School Police officers patrol the scene after an incident in which a gunman fired shots inside the Bronx-Lebanon Hospital in New York City, U.S. June 30, 2017.Brendan McdermidBello had received a limited permit to practice as an international medical graduate in order to gain experience so he could be fully licensed, but that permit expired a year ago, the Times reported. It said he also had a pharmacy technician license from California. The Daily News said he had been a pharmacy tech at the hospital before he quit in 2015. A native of Nigeria, Bello earned a medical degree from Ross University on the Caribbean island nation of Dominica and later worked briefly as a pharmacy technician for Metropolitan Hospital Center in Manhattan in 2012, according to David Wims, a lawyer who represented Bello in an unemployment insurance claim against that hospital. In a telephone interview, Wims told Reuters Bello was injured on the job at Metropolitan a few months after being hired, then went on leave and never returned. In a decision upheld by the state's appellate court division, Bello ultimately was denied unemployment benefits on grounds he quit without good cause. Wims said he remembered Bello as  an even-keeled, respectful, humble person  and knew nothing of his history at the Bronx hospital. Slideshow (21 Images)Details about the shooting were still sketchy. Authorities said the rampage unfolded shortly before 3 p.m. when the gunman went on a rampage on the 16th and 17th floors of the hospital. He and the slain physician both were found on the 17th floor, while the six other victims were found on the 16th floor, O'Neill said. The incident sent waves of panic throughout the hospital, and police swarmed the building searching for the gunman.  People were running. People were afraid,  said Jane Vachara, 50, a clerical associate on the ninth floor, who said she huddled with colleagues in a locker room for about an hour. Adding to the pandemonium was the gunman's attempt to set himself ablaze, which apparently triggered the hospital's fire alarm system and halted elevator service, hampering efforts by first responders to reach victims and evacuate the building.   One ambulance worker, Robert Maldonado, told WCBS television that he and his partner had to carry a bleeding patient down nine flights of stairs to safety, applying pressure to the man's wound on the way down. Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Center, located about one mile (1.6 km) north of Yankee Stadium, is the largest voluntary, non-profit health care system serving the South and Central Bronx, as well as one of the city's biggest providers of outpatient services.

That happened Friday night and Baltimore right-hander Darren O'Day paid for it. Souza hit a three-run homer off O'Day in the top of the 10th inning as the Tampa Bay Rays rallied for a 6-4 victory over the Orioles. Corey Dickerson walked to start the 10th and Logan Morrison drew a one-out intentional walk from O'Day (1-2). Souza crushed his three-run shot to center that gave Tampa Bay (42-40) a 6-3 lead.  It's happened to me a few times this year,  Souza said.  I'm coming in there and showing, 'Hey, if you're going to let me come to the dish, I'm going to make you pay for it.  This was Souza's first extra-base hit in his last seven games, and manager Kevin Cash has been impressed with how he is approaching at-bats.  I think how much he's matured as a player,  Cash said.  He doesn't force the situation. I think he went up there with O'Day with an approach and stuck to it. He wasn't going to get anything away, kind of sold out to that and stuck with it.  Cash also liked how the Rays got help from a number of places in rallying from a 3-2 deficit in the ninth, one strike away from a loss, to tie the score and then win it. Related CoveragePreview: Rays at OriolesTampa Bay Rays - PlayerWatchBaltimore Orioles - PlayerWatchPinch-hitter Shane Peterson started the turnaround when he walked against Baltimore closer Brad Brach with two outs -- nearly striking out -- and then went to second on a balk. Pinch-runner Peter Bourjos moved to third on a wild pitch and then scored on Adeiny Hechavarria's fourth single of the night, which forced extra innings and set up the Souza homer.  I was really just trying to see it deep and put together a good at-bat,  Peterson said.  I was just basically trying to keep the game alive at that point.  That walk clearly frustrated Brach afterward.  I can't walk a guy there,  Brach said.  That just can't happen.  Jumbo Diaz (1-3) got the win thanks to a scoreless ninth, and Alex Colome closed it in the 10th for his 21st save despite allowing a solo homer to Mark Trumbo to start the inning. The Rays out-hit the Orioles 10-5 as Baltimore left just one runner on base in the game and Tampa Bay came up with a few threats.  I don't know (about) stealing one, but we only had four hits through nine innings, five through 10,  Orioles manager Buck Showalter said.  I think that was more of the story than anything. We had a shot there at trying to get one, but they did a good job.  The game swung back and forth in the final few innings. The score was tied at 2 when Adam Jones lined a double to right off Rays starter Jake Faria to start the seventh. Jones went to third when Souza mishandled the ball in the corner and scored on a Trumbo single. Faria allowed three runs and four hits in 6 2/3 innings in his fifth major league start. Chris Tillman of Baltimore (39-40) saw his winless streak stretch to 10 starts despite a strong performance. The right-hander allowed two runs and seven hits in five-plus innings and left with the Orioles trailing 2-1. Joey Rickard (two RBIs) tied the score at 2 with a solo homer leading off the bottom of the sixth, which set up the late-inning dramatics. Ramos gave the Rays a 2-0 lead in the second with his first homer of the season, a two-run shot on a 1-2 pitch off Tillman. The catcher missed most of the first three months of the season while recovering from a torn ACL. The Orioles cut that lead in half when Rickard lined an RBI double to left-center field in the third, their first hit of the game off Faria.

LHP Zach Britton is set for one more rehab assignment (Monday at Triple-A Norfolk), and if all goes well, he could rejoin the Orioles on July 5. ...
