[{"content": "The Labor Department\u2019s new \u201cfiduciary\u201d rule is meant to protect retirement savers from conflicted investment advice, by requiring that a financial adviser put the client\u2019s interest first.But it can\u2019t protect them from this side effect: a raft of new terminology and mutual-fund share classes to decipher.Mutual-fund companies have been introducing an alphabet soup of share classes or expanding the use of existing share classes to help financial advisers comply with the landmark rule. So, this is a good time to sort out the related terminology, old and new, and the share classes such as A, R, T, Z and \u201cclean shares,\u201d that are growing up around the rule or being disrupted by it.\u2022 Fiduciary: Let\u2019s start with the key word in all this. The fiduciary standard requires that a financial adviser put the client\u2019s best interest first. The new rule, which began to take effect June 9, requires that financial advisers who make recommendations on tax-advantaged retirement savings\u2014such as 401(k) plans, individual retirement accounts and health savings accounts\u2014act in their clients\u2019 best interests. It aims to reduce conflicts of interest that could impact an estimated $3 trillion in retirement assets.Before the rule was implemented, many brokers advised retirement savers under a \u201csuitability\u201d standard, which required that they recommend products that were suitable for a particular client, but not necessarily in the client\u2019s best interest. In addition, an adviser was previously considered a fiduciary only if he gave regular investment advice to an investor, and if there was a mutual understanding between the adviser and the investor that the adviser was offering individualized advice.Under the fiduciary rule, a much broader group of advisers, including many brokers who previously advised retirement investors under a suitability standard, are obligated to act as fiduciaries, says       Fred Reish,        a partner in the employee benefits and executive compensation practice group at law firm Drinker Biddle & Reath LLP. Any adviser who makes an investment recommendation on assets in a tax-advantaged retirement plan specifically directed to the individual retirement account owner, plan participant or plan fiduciary is considered a fiduciary. That adviser must put the investors\u2019 interest above his own and engage in a prudent process to analyze the investors\u2019 needs and make a recommendation at the level of a knowledgeable person.It is likely to result in advisers paying more attention to the cost of investment products and the quality of investment managers, he says.\u2022 Level-fee fiduciary: Financial advisers who receive level fees charge a set percentage of a client\u2019s assets under management a year or a set fee that doesn\u2019t vary based on the adviser\u2019s recommendations. That is in contrast to those who charge commissions that vary based on their recommendations, such as for stock trades or mutual fund sales, or who receive similar types of compensation from a third party, such as a mutual-fund company.The fiduciary rule may encourage advisers to take only level fees because it offers streamlined compliance obligations for those who do. To qualify as a pure \u201clevel-fee fiduciary\u201d under the rule, an adviser and any affiliates or related parties may receive only level fees for offering advice or investment management to a retirement plan or IRA. Broker-dealers or registered investment advisers who accept varying compensation will have to comply with more stringent procedures and disclosure requirements under some circumstances when offering advice to IRA clients or to tax-advantaged retirement plans.Investors working with advisers who accept varying compensation will receive more disclosures because such compensation creates conflicts of interests so there is more to disclose, says       Michael Kitces,        a partner and director of wealth management at Pinnacle Advisory Group Inc.Until Jan. 1, however, there is a transitionary exemption under which advisers\u2014regardless of the type of compensation they receive\u2014may opt to operate. Advisers must operate in the clients\u2019 best interest, accept only reasonable compensation and make no materially misleading statements. But under this transitionary exemption, advisers aren\u2019t required to make certain disclosures or execute a contractual fiduciary agreement with IRA investors which is enforceable under state law, as they will have to after Dec. 31 if they accept varying compensation.\u2022 12B-1 fees: Not a new term, but part of the new rule. Many mutual funds subtract 12b-1 fees from their assets to compensate brokers or other distributors. These fees, which pay for marketing and various shareholder services, often go unnoticed by investors. But at 0.25% to 1% of a client\u2019s assets in a fund annually, they can take a toll on a portfolio.The fees have been in decline over the years, and the fiduciary rule will accelerate that trend. Now when an adviser operating under the fiduciary rule wants to recommend a fund that includes a share class that charges 12b-1 fees to investors, many advisers will likely conclude that they should choose the share class without the 12b-1 fee.\u201cThat obligation never existed before for any IRA, so it\u2019s an immense, dominant pressure that will probably make most 12b-1 fees in IRAs vanish in the next few years,\u201d says Mr. Kitces.\u2022 Class A shares: Mutual-fund companies offer different types of fund shares, which each carry different fees. Investors who purchase Class A shares of a fund through a broker typically pay a sales charge ranging from 2.25% to 5.75% of the assets they\u2019re investing, according to Morningstar Inc. It is a payment that is often overlooked by investors because it\u2019s bundled in with cost of the fund\u2019s management, and is passed on to the distributor by the fund company.Some mutual-fund experts speculate that Class A shares and some other older fund share types will decline in popularity\u2014and may die out\u2014under the fiduciary rule as fund companies develop shares with lower fees and shares that don\u2019t include any fees to compensate distributors.\u201cIs the A share dead? That is pretty likely,\u201d says       Paul Ellenbogen,        head of global regulatory solutions at Morningstar Inc.\u2022 Class T shares: Class T shares (the T is for \u201ctransaction\u201d) aim to help remove the temptation for advisers to recommend a higher-cost fund over a less-expensive option. These new shares feature uniform sales charges across all fund categories. No difference in price offers no financial incentive to push one fund over another.T shares would typically charge a 2.5% load, or sales fee, when purchased and a 12b-1 fee of 0.25% to pay for distribution or other expenses, according to Morningstar. The front-end load may decline for larger purchases.At least 123 T share classes have already been launched, and more are on the way, according to Morningstar.\u2022 Clean shares: Some investment professionals consider new \u201cclean shares\u201d the wave of the future. These shares charge only the fee to manage and operate a mutual fund, and don\u2019t include payments to distributors, such as the broker-dealers and retirement-plan platforms that sell the funds.Investors who buy clean shares will likely pay 60% to 70% less to buy a fund, says Mr. Ellenbogen. But investors will have to pay separately for any advice they receive from a broker so it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they\u2019ll pay less overall. The new shares could help advisers and brokers comply with the fiduciary rule in two ways, Morningstar says. Firms that wish to qualify as \u201clevel-fee\u201d fiduciaries must strip out third-party payments of any kind, which clean shares do, and firms that wish to continue receiving sales fees, or commissions, could sell clean shares, then set their own commissions that are the same across products.Clean shares will also magically boost the performance of the average actively managed mutual fund, says Mr. Kitces. That is because mutual funds currently have to report their performance net of commissions and broker compensation. As broker-dealers shift to being compensated by commissions outside of the funds, \u201cthe mutual fund itself will no longer have to count the broker\u2019s compensation against their own performance,\u201d he says.Clean shares carry different monikers: American Funds, a subsidiary of Capital Group, began this year offering F3 shares, which charge no fees to pay distributors, and             Janus Capital Group,       now             Janus Henderson Group,       filed in January to offer Z shares, which are also free of any fees to distributors.Rather than creating new shares, some fund companies are simply expanding the creation of Class R shares. Those shares were previously available only through employer-sponsored retirement plans, such as 401(k)s, and are usually a fund company\u2019s lowest-priced share class.Ms. Maxey is a reporter for The Wall Street Journal in New York.

Because a new Labor Department rule that began to take effect in June holds brokers to a fiduciary standard\u2014meaning they have to act in the best interest of their clients\u2014when offering guidance on tax-favored retirement accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs. Previously, the standard for brokers was less strict: They were required to offer only \u201csuitable\u201d guidance.The new rule doesn\u2019t apply to nonretirement accounts; brokers still only have to meet the suitability standard for those. And it doesn\u2019t dramatically affect investment advisers registered with the SEC, who already were held to a fiduciary standard for all accounts in advising clients on how to invest. (One way it does affect them is by applying a fiduciary standard to their advice on withdrawals from retirement accounts.)But the change still serves as a reminder of the differences in the rules governing brokers and registered investment advisers, making this a good time for investors to review their situation to be sure it\u2019s the best arrangement for them.Thanks to ample publicity surrounding the new rule, some investors may have come to associate a fiduciary duty with better performance and service. But industry participants say that isn\u2019t necessarily the case. After all, having a fiduciary responsibility doesn\u2019t guarantee a financial professional will dole out sound advice or generate stellar investment returns for clients, they say.Here are some things investors need to understand as they decide whether to stick with their current situation or make a change.First, investors who aren\u2019t certain of their broker\u2019s or adviser\u2019s fiduciary status can always ask. But that status alone shouldn\u2019t be the basis for firing someone who has performed well for an investor in the past, industry watchers say.Rather, they say the decision to maintain or end a relationship with a financial professional depends largely on an individual\u2019s needs, past investment performance, fees and the professional\u2019s regulatory history.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter whether he or she is a fiduciary or not. It\u2019s all based on performance and what you\u2019re paying to get that performance,\u201d says       Charles Field,        a New York-based partner at the law firm Sanford Heisler Sharp LLP and co-chairman of the firm\u2019s financial-services practice. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t keep your gardener if all your shrubs were dying. You\u2019d get another one. The same thing should be true for your financial adviser,\u201d he says.Mr. Field suggests investors meet with their broker or adviser to discuss their portfolio\u2019s performance, after fees, and how it compares with the appropriate benchmarks. Those who are worthy of an investor\u2019s business will be transparent about their fee structure, he adds.Another consideration is how much help the investor needs. \u201cPart of the decision is: Do you need ongoing planning and advice?\u201d says       Jamie Hopkins,        who co-directs the retirement-income program at the American College of Financial Services. Generally, advisers offer more comprehensive financial guidance than brokers.Some investors may be better off with a broker who is paid by a commission on transactions than they would be with an adviser who is a fiduciary and is paid an annual flat fee or one based on account size. A fee-based model may be more expensive for some investors and of questionable value, especially for younger investors who don\u2019t have a lot of money to invest and don\u2019t require much advice. \u201cAt a certain point, it\u2019s probably not even worth it\u201d to pay an adviser who charges a fee, says       James Choi,        professor of finance at the Yale School of Management.A broker can also make sense for certain buy-and-hold strategies\u2014for instance, when buying bonds an investor plans to hold until maturity or accumulating stocks for the long term, says       James Poer,        chief executive of Kestra Financial, an Austin, Texas, firm that offers both brokerage and fee-based advisory services. In these instances, it makes no sense to pay a continuing asset-management fee, he says.On the flip side, for investors who have a sizable sum to invest or who need more continuing advice than their broker can provide, it could be more economical to switch to a registered investment adviser, says       Ryan D. Brown,        an attorney with expertise in finance and retirement planning who is a partner at CR Myers & Associates in Southfield, Mich.\u201cYou have to align yourself with an adviser who meets with your goals and objectives. It\u2019s a very individual decision,\u201d he says.Some brokerage firms offer both commission and fee-based services, so that\u2019s another question to ask before making a switch, Mr. Poer says.The decision-making process should also include a visit to BrokerCheck, a website maintained by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority that gives a snapshot of a broker\u2019s experience, licensing information and regulatory history. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to do business with anyone who has a ding on BrokerCheck,\u201d says Mr. Field, the Sanford Heisler attorney.The Securities and Exchange Commission has a similar tool for registered investment advisers, at adviserinfo.sec.gov.To be sure, the issue of having to decide between an adviser who is a fiduciary and one who isn\u2019t may eventually be moot. If proponents have their way, all financial professionals eventually will be governed by the same best-interest standard, regardless of how they are registered or the types of accounts they service. The SEC continues to consider the matter and recently requested industry comments. Meanwhile, the Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards is attempting its own fix. It recently floated a proposal to expand the fiduciary duty to anyone holding the certified financial planner designation, which includes brokers.Regardless of whether an adviser has a fiduciary obligation, investors always want to work with someone who has their best interest in mind, says       Jamie Price,        chief executive of Advisor Group, which owns four brokerage firms and a registered investment advisory and provides compliance and advisory services to independent investment advisers and their clients.To determine whether that\u2019s the case, he says, investors should ask a lot of questions and refuse to work with anyone\u2014fiduciary or not\u2014who doesn\u2019t meet their expectations.\u201cThe best advisers are very transparent about everything,\u201d he says.Ms. Winokur Munk is a writer in West Orange, N.J.

Mr. Miller and fellow portfolio manager,       Samantha McLemore,        left Legg Mason last year.Mr. Miller\u2019s Baltimore-based fund beat its nearest rival by nearly 6 percentage points, with a return for the 12 months ended June 30 of 48.55%.The quarterly Winners\u2019 Circle contest is designed to identify which U.S. stock fund with at least $50 million in assets and a record of more than three years posted the best performance in the trailing 12 months. Index funds and exchange-traded funds don\u2019t qualify because they aren\u2019t actively managed; leveraged funds also aren\u2019t included.Mr. Miller was a top runner-up in this contest in the final quarter of 2009, when his other fund, Legg Mason Opportunity Trust, posted an 86% gain in the midst of the recovery from the financial crisis. The same fund dominated the Winners\u2019 Circle for several quarters in a row, in 2013 and 2014, when some of the turnaround companies it held in its portfolios posted triple-digit returns in only a few months. Now, once again, Mr. Miller\u2019s patient buy-and-hold strategy has paid off for investors, with retailer Restoration Hardware Holdings rebounding by about 110% in the past six months alone.Mr. Miller says adding Restoration Hardware to the portfolio was originally Ms. McLemore\u2019s idea. Her interest in the company was piqued by arguments that             Restoration Hardware        RH 3.17%       was poised to benefit from millennial spending habits. \u201cWhen the stock was hit hard last year and fell to a low of $24, we went and visited the company,\u201d Ms. McLemore says. The duo concluded that the issues plaguing it\u2014excess spending on warehouses, among them\u2014were temporary, and that when the company\u2019s earnings power became visible once more, the stock would benefit.Ms. McLemore also advocated investing in             Wayfair Inc.,       which has soared about 90% over the past 12 months. After Wayfair\u2019s 2014 initial public offering, it spent heavily at a time when investors were fearful that Amazon would annihilate all other retailers. After analyzing the business, Mr. Miller and Ms. McLemore concluded that the stock\u2019s selloff and the massive short selling weren\u2019t justified. \u201cThe firm was making sound investments, and management owned 40% of the company,\u201d Ms. McLemore says.Mr. Miller doesn\u2019t shy away from companies with dark clouds hanging over their heads, having profited from investing in market pariahs in the past. He found the idea of investing in         Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc.,       the specialty pharmaceuticals company that came under investigation for price gouging in 2015 and that other hedge-fund managers lost millions on, intriguing in the wake of a management shake-up last year.Mr. Miller bought Valeant when it fell to $30, figuring it could rebound to $60. That\u2019s still a distant prospect, since the shares have fallen further and now change hands for about $17. Still, the company remains an example of his long-term strategy. \u201cThe new team is doing everything that they said they would do, and Valeant has several quite good businesses,\u201d he says. \u201cThe top line should start growing again in 2018.\u201dMeanwhile, Mr. Miller can point to payoffs from other long-term investments, such as his airline holdings, as proof of his strategy: United Airlines is up 83% and             American Airlines Group                   has gained 80% in the past year alone. In both cases, the fund invested when shares were trading at about $7.Among other ventures Mr. Miller likes is bioengineering firm             Intrexon,       which he describes as a financially sound company that needs FDA approval for some key products to become a big winner. The products include an apple that doesn\u2019t brown when it has been cut or bitten into, and a topical cream designed to be a safer, less painful alternative to laser removal of tattoos.The Winners\u2019 Circle runner-up for the second quarter in a row was          Baron Discovery Fund       (BDFIX), which posted a gain of 43.85% for the 12 months ended June 30 but actually outperformed the winner in the second quarter. The Baron fund, co-managed by       Laird Bieger       and       Randy Gwirtzman,        earned 11.6% in the June quarter, compared with 11.8% for Miller Opportunity.The fund\u2019s returns come courtesy of an intriguing assortment of holdings in 62 smaller growth companies, including its biggest winner,             Everspin Technologies Inc.,       which makes a new kind of memory chip known as MRAM for which new applications are being found daily. Another related holding is             Impinj Inc.,       which went public in July 2016 and has more than doubled since then. \u201cThey make a microchip the size of a grain of sand that can be placed on a tag,\u201d says Mr. Bieger, noting that two of the firm\u2019s biggest customers are retailers             Macy\u2019s Inc.       and Zara, which can now manage their inventory in real time.             Delta Air Lines Inc.       has begun to use the microchips, enabling travelers to confirm that their checked bags are on the same plane they are, and after landing to see if they are making their way to a luggage-claim area.Mr. Bieger is looking for opportunities to profit from technological disruption\u2014such as the fund\u2019s investment in             Trade Desk Inc.,       a platform that uses algorithms to buy online advertising\u2014and avoiding areas where online trends are creating headwinds, such as e-commerce and retailing more generally (except for specialist firm             Party City Holdco Inc.      ). While the fund managers are patient, they don\u2019t want to battle adverse cyclical trends: Their goal is to double their money in five years, or generate a 15% compounded annual return.Now, that sounds like a winner\u2019s recipe.Ms. McGee is a writer in New England.

But such metrics don\u2019t always offer a clear picture of how resilient a fund is likely to be in tough times.That is why more attention should be paid to \u201cmax drawdown\u201d\u2014the maximum decline a fund has experienced from peak to trough over a given period. When combined with standard deviation, max drawdown can reveal more about a fund\u2019s past volatility than standard deviation alone.First, however, a closer look at standard deviation: Generally, the wider the range, the greater the volatility of that investment. For example, over long periods, the stock market\u2019s annual returns have averaged around 10% and its standard deviation has been about 18, meaning the majority\u2014though not all\u2014of the market\u2019s annual returns have been between 28% and minus 8%.That\u2019s a big range, so standard deviation is useful in understanding that the stock market has inflicted a wild ride on investors in exchange for delivering its annualized 10% return. But it doesn\u2019t quite tell investors how much downside volatility they can expect to endure. That\u2019s because there can be multiple years of negative returns easily exceeding an 8% loss (such as the bear market of 2000-02) or much bigger single-year losses than 8% (such as in 2008). Standard deviation only captures a majority of results around an average, not the full range of results.These days, even an 8% calendar-year loss might seem surprising to investors who have been treated to unusually calm markets and whose short memories make the 2008-09 bear market seem like ancient history. But it is really a ho-hum event in the long stretch of market history when you consider that the last two bear markets\u2014in 2000-02 and 2008-09\u2014saw drawdowns of 50%. Also, the stock market has experienced eight bear markets as defined as a drop of 20% or more since 1929 and countless pullbacks of 10% to 20%. These statistics may be more meaningful in conveying the past volatility of the stock market to investors than standard deviation of returns.Finally, standard deviation doesn\u2019t distinguish between upside and downside volatility. Of course, investors want the former without the latter.To see how volatility can be deceiving by itself, we looked at domestic large-cap funds with more than $1 billion in assets for two time periods\u2014the beginning of 2008 through May 2017 and from the beginning of 2010 through May 2017. The first period captures the three most recent significant declines\u2014the crisis period in 2008-09 and the market swoons in the late summer of 2011 and late 2015\u2014early 2016. The latter period captures only the second two.We found a number of examples where looking at just one volatility metric in isolation could be deceiving.First,          AMG Yacktman Focused Fund       (YAFFX) had stellar relative max drawdowns of 38% and 11% for both periods under consideration, when compared with the 51% and 16% max drawdowns for the S&P 500 Total Return Index.Yet Yacktman Focused looks unremarkable on standard-deviation metrics. The fund\u2019s three-year standard deviation is 10.1, and its 10-year standard deviation is 15.6. Those readings are in line with the 10.4 three-year and 15.2 10-year readings of the S&P 500 Total Return Index. In this case, the fund\u2019s max-drawdown statistics would give an investor a better understanding than standard deviation of its resilience in bad times.Sequoia Fund       (SEQUX) poses a somewhat different problem\u2014its long-term volatility looks muted, but its more-recent max drawdown number is alarming. A top performer with low relative volatility for decades, including during the financial crisis, the fund stumbled in 2015 and 2016 with a large position in embattled Canadian drug company         Valeant Pharmaceuticals.       Its max drawdown from 2010 through May 2017 is 31% versus 16% for the S&P 500.But just as Sequoia\u2019s record of stability made it hard to forecast its recent stumble, its recent high volatility numbers may also be a poor guide to the future. Recent reforms on position sizes and committee reviews instituted after the Valeant debacle could result in the fund returning to its formerly muted volatility profile.Last, a look at the Russell 1000 Value Index and the Russell 1000 Growth Index shows that although their longer-term standard-deviation statistics are similar, the value index has had larger max drawdowns than the growth index since 2008. That\u2019s mostly due to financial stocks tanking during the financial crisis and during the downdraft in the summer of 2011. However, given the run of stocks like             Facebook Inc.,       Google parent         Alphabet Inc.       and             Netflix Inc.,       along with the attraction to dividend-paying consumer-staples stocks, the next downturn could be more similar to the 2000-02 bear market, hurting growth stocks more than value stocks.Mr. Coumarianos, a former Morningstar analyst, is a writer in Laguna Niguel, Calif.

But in many months and quarters, the diversification strategy didn\u2019t pay off, as U.S. stocks climbed to a series of highs.Now it is. While U.S. stocks are performing well, as corporate earnings roll on, international-stock funds are doing even better. Cheaper valuations in the rest of the world and support from central banks has turned the tide.Mutual funds and exchange-traded funds focused on U.S. stocks gained a respectable 2.7% in the second quarter\u2014their fifth straight quarterly gain. But international-stock funds were up 6.5%, according to Thomson Reuters Lipper data.

According to Mr. Schutte, the \u201cquestions I was getting in the last few years [were] \u2018why invest [overseas] at all?\u2019 And \u2018why does diversification matter?\u2019 \u201dNow, he says, \u201cwe believe international and emerging markets will outperform in the second half,\u201d as they did in the first.An estimated net of nearly $78.42 billion flowed to mutual funds and ETFs that invest in international stocks in the second quarter, based on Investment Company Institute data. In contrast, an estimated $23.31 billion flowed out of U.S.-stock funds in the quarter.Health/biotechnology funds led the way in the U.S., registering an 8.5% gain for the quarter and a 20% first-half advance.Investors wary about the valuations of U.S. stocks and convinced that the Federal Reserve will be measured in raising interest rates also put their faith in bonds. An estimated $93.67 billion flowed to bond funds in the quarter.Bond-fund performance has been positive. Funds focused on intermediate-maturity, investment-grade debt (the most common type of fixed-income fund) were up 1.4% in the quarter and up 2.4% for the first half.\u201cIf you would have started the year telling me both the stock and bond markets would have pretty positive returns in the first six months, that is something I wouldn\u2019t have thought would have happened,\u201d says Mr. Schutte. \u201cFor the second half,\u201d he adds, \u201cwe believe we\u2019ll see rising interest rates alongside a still-rising equity market, but perhaps more volatility,\u201d as the Fed winds down its bond portfolio and rates rise.However, he says, \u201cWe\u2019ve de-emphasized interest-rate-sensitive sectors like real-estate investment trusts and utilities; we would rather own traditional equities like the S&P than REITs.\u201dMr. Power is a Wall Street Journal news editor in South Brunswick, N.J.

The most important is state taxes. Having to pay state taxes on withdrawals eats into your returns. So a good first step is to find out whether the state where you are a tax resident will give you state-tax benefits for choosing a specific 529 plan (28 states and Washington, D.C., do), says       Andrea Feirstein,        a 529 consultant to states and managing director of AKF Consulting Group in New York. Five other states offer tax benefits if you save in any 529 plan.Some states also offer a partial scholarship if you start an account with your own state\u2019s plan, Ms. Feirstein says. For instance, New Jersey residents who invest in the state\u2019s 529 plan can earn a scholarship of up to $1,500 for the first semester of the student\u2019s freshman year at an approved school in the state, depending on how long their account has been open and how much they have contributed to it. The New Jersey scholarships start at $500 for an account that has been open for four years with contributions totaling at least $1,200.Next, think about whether you want a financial adviser to sell you the plan (nearly every state offers this kind of plan) or whether you want to invest in a direct-sold plan (31 states have these). Adviser-sold plans tend to have higher fees. You should also consider which investment managers are involved in your other investments when you choose the company that will administer your 529, Ms. Feirstein says. \u201cWe believe that manager diversity is always worth considering,\u201d she says.Finally, some state plans give you a menu of investing options that include low-cost, passively managed index funds, while others feature more expensive, actively managed funds. Make sure the plan you choose has the fund type you prefer, Ms. Feirstein says.For help with comparing states\u2019 529 plans, look at College Savings Plans Network (collegesavings.org), Savingforcollege.com, and Morningstar.com.Whichever plan you choose, the key is to get started saving, Ms. Feirstein says. \u201cThere is simply no substitute for getting this process under way and having funds work for you on a tax-deferred basis, regardless of how little or how much you can contribute or how early or late you may be to the game.\u201dI am about to marry a woman who has a daughter in college, receiving financial aid. How will my income be treated when awarding aid to my new stepdaughter?If your new wife is the custodial parent of her daughter, then your income will be taken into consideration when calculating your stepdaughter\u2019s financial aid, says       Martha Savery,        director of public affairs at the Massachusetts Educational Financing Authority. See more on custodial parents and financial aid at studentaid.gov, and you should call your stepdaughter\u2019s college financial-aid office to see how this would work in your particular situation, Ms. Savery says.Are furniture and furnishings for a student\u2019s off-campus apartment an eligible 529 withdrawal expense?No. The earnings portion of withdrawals used for these purposes are subject to ordinary income tax and the 10% federal penalty for nonqualified withdrawals, Ms. Feirstein says.Can I donate excess 529 funds to a scholarship program at a qualifying institution, avoid the 10% penalty and declare it a charitable donation?You can make this donation and it will be deductible, but the withdrawal won\u2019t be tax- or penalty-free. As with any nonqualified withdrawal, the earnings portion of the money you take out of your 529 will be subject to ordinary income tax and subject to the federal 10% penalty tax.Ms. Schoenberger is a writer in New York.

He is betting that the world needs more exchange-traded funds focused on commodities, even though commodity prices only recently began to emerge from a terrible five-year stretch.Then again, the 38-year-old native of Aberdeen, Scotland, was part of a success in commodity ETFs: Before GraniteShares, he was CEO of World Gold Trust Services, sponsor of          SPDR Gold Shares,       the $33 billion gold fund.His new company launched its first two ETFs in May:          GraniteShares Bloomberg Commodity Broad Strategy No K-1 ETF       (COMB) and GraniteShares S&P GSCI Commodity Broad Strategy No K-1 ETF (COMG). The company has received funding from a number of investors, principally Bain Capital, which is a shareholder.Mr. Rhind\u2014whose ETF career began with iShares before he helped launch ETF Securities\u2014spoke with The Wall Street Journal about the challenge and opportunity of his ETF gambit. Edited excerpts from that interview follow.WSJ: Why did you decide to launch your own ETF company?MR. RHIND: Growing up in Aberdeen, we\u2019ve got some great role models, particularly in financial services. You\u2019ve got great entrepreneurs like       Martin Gilbert       of             Aberdeen Asset Management.       He went to the same school that I did in Aberdeen and was a big role model for me growing up. I\u2019d always wanted to get onto the entrepreneurial side and eventually run my own business, but you need experience.You have to gain the necessary experience and stature in the industry before you can credibly go out on your own.WSJ: How did you secure funding?MR. RHIND: When you\u2019re backing a company at such an early stage you\u2019re really backing the people, because there is no business. When they invested in us, the company was really just a PowerPoint and an Excel spreadsheet. We had a very clear vision for what a new kind of ETF company looks like. If you\u2019re an ETF entrepreneur, that often means you\u2019re the equivalent of an inventor in a garden shed and you come up with a fund idea and think \u201cHey, this would be a great ETF.\u201d But very few of those people really think about how to build a company. Coming up with one idea is hard enough, but coming up with multiple ideas and a broader strategy is even more difficult.WSJ: What does it take to start an ETF company?MR. RHIND: A company that enters the ETF space has to do four core things. You have to be multi asset class\u2014offer products in fixed income, equities, commodities. The market\u2019s always changing, and there\u2019s not one asset class that will always be in vogue. Then on the product side you need to compete on price. That literally means offering a low-cost product and competing with the likes of             BlackRock        BLK -0.10%       or Vanguard or the other big players. Third, you need to be able to innovate, and bring a superior engineering skill to the actual fund construction. And then lastly, most importantly, you need to be original. You need to be able to bring new ideas to market.WSJ: It\u2019s a crowded market. How do you stand out to investors?MR. RHIND: Any industry now is competitive. There are plenty of ETFs and there is plenty of choice out there. But we have to keep in mind that on a relative basis, there are still very few ETFs versus mutual funds. There are now just over 2,000 ETFs, but there are over 7,000 mutual funds, and there are still mutual funds coming to market every day. So there\u2019s still a lot of room to grow, compared to the legacy mutual-fund business.WSJ: Why do you see room for growth in commodities?MR. RHIND:I\u2019d rather be launching a business close to the bottom of a cycle than the top. If you look at the performance of commodities over the last five years, we\u2019ve had a horrendous bear market, which turned around last year and delivered the first positive performance in five years. Who knows where we\u2019ll end up at the end of this year, but the signs are that commodity markets are finally turning the corner.Mr. Cowan is a writer in Northern Ireland.

And this changing of the guard, temporary or not, means at least one tech fund is outperforming not only the S&P 500 but the S&P Tech index, and without overweighting the FANGs. That\u2019s good news for tech-fund investors who worry that FANG stocks have become overvalued.The year\u2019s top-performing actively managed tech fund through July 7, according to data from Morningstar, is          T. Rowe Price Global Technology       (PRGTX), which listed only an 11% allocation to FANG stocks for the first quarter. The T. Rowe fund\u2019s shares have risen 28.7% so far this year, before dividends, thanks in part to positions in London-based telecom firm             Liberty Global        LBTYA -0.34%       and             Tesla,        TSLA -0.91%       the latter of which it recently sold. The S&P 500 and S&P Tech index, by contrast, have returned 8.3% and 17%, respectively.The fund\u2019s largest holding is cloud-computing leader             Salesforce.com,        CRM 0.32%       says manager       Josh Spencer.       The $4.8 billion fund has a small exposure to Amazon and just recently bought some Netflix, but for much of this year Alphabet was the only FANG stock in its top 10 holdings. It also has no Apple shares. As the global tech fund\u2019s name implies, it has also put more than a quarter of its money to work outside the U.S.The second- and third-best returns for actively managed tech funds to date, by contrast\u2014in a virtual tie\u2014are          Fidelity Advisor Technology Fund       (FATIX) and          Fidelity Select Technology       (FSPTX)\u2014each of which each devotes more than a quarter of its portfolio to FANG shares and Apple. The Fidelity Advisor Technology fund posted a return of 27.7% through July 7, and Fidelity Select Technology posted a return of 27.68%. Both returns are before dividends.Mr. Spencer says he isn\u2019t down on FANG. He just thinks it isn\u2019t the only interesting technology around. He is just as interested\u2014and more interested, at current prices\u2014in chips, in software for industrial automation, in videogaming and in cloud computing.Fidelity\u2019s two top tech funds also have bets outside the FANGs, including Tesla and large investments in chip companies and Asian web businesses such as             JD.com.        JD 0.54%       But Apple, Facebook and Alphabet are the top three holdings of Fidelity Advisor Technology, accounting for more than a quarter of the fund, according to SEC filings.Indeed, many tech-fund managers still like the FANG companies: 70% of actively managed funds are overweight the four companies\u2019 share of the S&P 500, and short interest in the FANGs has all but evaporated, says Bank of America Merrill Lynch strategist       Savita Subramanian.But even after the recent selloff in tech stocks, Alphabet is trading at 28 times this year\u2019s estimated earnings and Facebook at 30; never mind the stratospheric multiples Netflix and Amazon have long commanded. Through July 7, Facebook was up 32% for the year, Amazon 31%, Netflix 21% and Alphabet Class A shares 19%. Apple shares are up 24%.But none of the FANGs, nor Apple, has climbed as much as the top 10 performers in the 69-stock S&P 500 Information Technology Index through July 7.The new class of tech outperformers, of course, also face risk of overvaluation or missteps. But this year\u2019s top 10 tech performers in the S&P Information Tech Index include videogame company             Activision Blizzard                         (up more than 50%), semiconductor manufacturing equipment maker         Lam Research               (40%), chip maker         Micron Technology               (38%), and videogame-chip maker         Nvidia               (37%). The common theme is their ties to markets growing faster than the projected 3% to 3.5% rise in corporate tech spending, says       Scott Kessler,        director of equity research at CFRA Research.For investors who want to be in the tech sector but are worried about being overweight in certain shares, there is also          Guggenheim S&P 500 Equal Weight Technology       ETF (RYT), which owns equal-weighted positions in each tech company in the S&P 500. (It also doesn\u2019t own Netflix and Amazon, which are members of S&P\u2019s Consumer Discretionary Index.) The $1.4 billion fund has scored a 16.4% return this year, according to ETF Database.\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit of the anti-Apple,\u201d says       Bill Belden,        head of product development at Guggenheim. \u201cWhen market leadership is narrow, there\u2019s a reversion to the mean where equal-weight funds can benefit.\u2019\u2019Mr. Mullaney is a writer in Maplewood, N.J.

It limits its investment in each category to 50%, except for emerging-market bonds, which it restricts to 5%, and high-yield bonds, which it limits to 25%.AGGP\u2019s approach, also known as \u201csmart beta,\u201d sits somewhere between active and passive investing. While the fund tracks an index, the index itself is biased toward a certain \u201cfactor\u201d\u2014in this case, momentum. Fund managers use price momentum to determine the allocation to each sector, while compensating for volatility. So if investment-grade corporate bonds have a high momentum score, the fund will overweight them relative to its benchmark, the Barclays Capital Aggregate Bond Index, and vice versa if the score is low.\u201cMomentum has been used in the equity world and commodities and currencies for a couple of decades,\u201d says       Sal Bruno,        chief investment officer and managing director at IndexIQ, which operates the fund. \u201cThis fund applies it to the fixed-income world.\u201dThe aim is for AGGP to serve as part of an investor\u2019s core portfolio, Mr. Bruno says. It tracks the benchmark closely and aims to have a similar level of volatility, with \u201csome potential outperformance from the rotation to different sectors that are working well.\u201dThere has been lower growth overall in smart beta in the fixed-income space, compared with equities, says       Kiril Nikolaev,        an analyst at researcher ETFdb.com.

There are reasons to think the trend may continue.Higher returns often are accompanied by greater volatility. For instance, stocks usually have higher returns and higher volatility than bonds.Not so for Asian junk debt this century. On average, it had bigger annualized returns than U.S. high-yield securities from 1999 through 2016 but about the same annualized volatility, according to an analysis by money-management firm Matthews Asia. The analysis also showed Asian junk had higher returns and lower volatility than similar securities from Latin America and Europe.The returns are higher in Asia because they have to be to attract investors. No matter how good a company is, it is affected by the credit of the country where it\u2019s based, and there are many Asian countries with imperfect credit.\u201cI call them good companies in bad ZIP Codes,\u201d says       Satya Patel,        a portfolio manager for          Matthews Asia Strategic Income       fund (MAINX).\u201cThe best company in India can only be a triple-B-minus,\u201d he says, because that is the rating of the Indian government. It\u2019s also just above a junk rating.The lower volatility of Asian junk debt may be a historical accident. Mr. Patel says Asia largely avoided the credit problems associated with the oil-price plunge of recent years because Asian oil companies frequently are closely linked to national governments, so their credit risks are lower. Asia also skirted the telecom bust around the turn of the century because the Asian telecom sector was in its infancy in the late 1990s and so didn\u2019t have the same level of debt issuance as the industry did in the U.S., he says.Mr. Patel points out that current yield spreads for junk debt\u2014the difference between the interest rates companies must pay to borrow and the rates governments pay\u2014are marginally higher than historical averages in Asia, while spreads elsewhere are below their averages. That means that if spreads were to move toward their historical averages, prices of junk debt would trend higher in Asia and lower elsewhere.\u201cAs an investor, you might be worried about the level the U.S., Europe or Latin America are at,\u201d says Mr. Patel. \u201cNot so much in Asia.\u201dMr. Constable is a writer who specializes in economics and markets.

Because it\u2019s hard for an individual to find another way to invest in the assets these funds hold.Interval funds typically invest in illiquid assets that aren\u2019t listed on any exchanges, including commercial property such as vast farmland or forestry tracts, as well as private equity and business loans. Few individual investors can afford to buy 10,000 acres of farmland, for instance.The illiquidity is why these funds don\u2019t offer shareholders the ability to redeem shares daily.Some researchers think there will be both a need and a demand for exposure to such assets in the near future.

They also questioned whether the U.S. should work with Russia on the issue, saying it would only empower a regime that has hacked systems in the U.S.The president on Sunday weighed in with an early-morning round of tweets in which he said Mr. Putin had \u201cvehemently denied\u201d any election meddling and Mr. Trump called for relations between the two countries to move forward \u201cconstructively.\u201d\u201cI strongly pressed President Putin twice about Russian meddling in our election. He vehemently denied it. I\u2019ve already given my opinion\u2026,\u201d tweeted Mr. Trump, who returned late Saturday from a four-day overseas trip that concluded in Hamburg, where he was attending the Group of 20 leading nations summit.The events of the past few days captured the ways in which Mr. Trump is caught between pressure at home to confront Russia over election meddling and his desire to work with Mr. Putin on defeating Islamic State and tamp down tensions between the two superpowers.The U.S. intelligence community has concluded that Mr. Putin ordered a campaign to influence the outcome of the 2016 U.S. presidential election in Mr. Trump\u2019s favor, and a special counsel appointed by the Justice Department this year is investigating whether Trump campaign aides colluded with Russia in that effort. Mr. Trump has denied there was any collusion and said he doubts the intelligence community\u2019s assessment, saying days earlier in Warsaw, \u201cNo one really knows for sure.\u201dWhile the Trump-Putin meeting was under way, officials confirmed that the U.S. and Russia had agreed on a cease-fire in southwest Syria, a limited deal they said was designed to show the two nations are able to find ways to cooperate. The sides had been meeting quietly over the past months to see if they could ratchet down the fighting in that part of Syria.\u201cWe negotiated a cease-fire in parts of Syria which will save lives. Now it is time to move forward in working constructively with Russia!\u201d Mr. Trump tweeted on Sunday morning.Mr. Trump said Sunday that the two leaders discussed forming a joint unit between their two nations to guard against cyberattacks. \u201cPutin & I discussed forming an impenetrable Cyber Security unit so that election hacking, & many other negative things, will be guarded and safe,\u201d he tweeted.Later in the evening, he appeared to walk back that suggestion. \u201cThe fact that President Putin and I discussed a Cyber Security unit doesn\u2019t mean I think it can happen. It can\u2019t-but a ceasefire can,& did!\u201d he tweeted.Tensions over Russia were amplified by news on Sunday that Donald Trump Jr., the president\u2019s eldest son, last June arranged a meeting for top campaign officials with a Russian lawyer with ties to the Kremlin who he was told had information that would be helpful to the campaign. Rep. Adam Schiff (D., Calif.), the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, on Sunday called for his panel\u2014which is investigating Trump associates\u2019 ties to Russia\u2014to question \u201ceveryone that was at that meeting about what was discussed.\u201dOn Friday, Mr. Trump met face-to-face with Mr. Putin at the summit, where he told the Russian leader that Americans are upset about Russia\u2019s actions and want them to stop, according to Secretary of State       Rex Tillerson.       Mr. Putin denied that Russia played a role, and the leaders opted not to \u201crelitigate\u201d the past, Mr. Tillerson said.Russia\u2019s account of the exchange differed from the American one. Russian Foreign Minister       Sergei Lavrov,        who was also in the meeting in Hamburg, told reporters afterward that said Mr. Trump accepted Mr. Putin\u2019s contention that Russia didn\u2019t interfere in the campaign.Administration officials in recent days have declined to refute that account. Asked in an interview on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d whether Mr. Trump had accepted Mr. Putin\u2019s denial of interference attempts, Treasury Secretary       Steven Mnuchin       responded: \u201cWhy should he answer that question directly? He\u2019s made it very clear how he feels.\u201dIn a separate interview on Fox News, White House chief of staff Reince Priebus said Mr. Trump \u201cabsolutely did not believe\u201d Mr. Putin\u2019s denial but didn\u2019t say whether the president had told the Russian leader that. \u201cYes, he believes Russia probably committed all of these acts we have been told of,\u201d Mr. Priebus said.The president\u2019s belief that Russia sought to meddle in the election doesn\u2019t take away from the ability of the U.S. to work with Russia going forward on issues such as combating Islamic State, Mr. Priebus said.\u201cYou can walk and chew gum at the same time,\u201d he said.Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, on Sunday defended the idea of working with Russia on cybersecurity, saying in a CNN interview that \u201cif we talk to them about it, hopefully we can cut this out and get them to stop.\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean we ever trust Russia,\u201d she said. \u201cBut you keep those that you don\u2019t trust closer so that you can always keep an eye on them and keep them in check.\u201dCybersecurity experts raised concerns that the administration would seek to use the joint unit as a means of addressing Russia\u2019s attempts to meddle in U.S. elections but said establishing communication between the two nations on cyber issues wasn\u2019t necessarily a bad idea.If the purpose of the unit is to discuss Russian hacking attempts against the U.S. and achieve a \u201cKumbaya in cyberspace,\u201d said Herbert Lin, a cybersecurity expert at the Center for International Security and Cooperation, \u201cthen it\u2019s a useless enterprise.\u201dBut he said there are areas where it is in the self-interest of both the U.S. and Russia to coordinate, such as in protecting the stability of the global financial system. \u201cRussia is clearly an adversary,\u201d Mr. Lin said. \u201cBut it\u2019s a silly idea to not talk to people who are your adversaries.\u201dOn Sunday, Mr. Tillerson told reporters in Kiev that the unit would be part of the administration\u2019s effort to address election-interference efforts. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be only about Russia,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be about international engagement as well.\u201dThe idea of a joint cybersecurity unit came under criticism from lawmakers in both parties, who question why the U.S. would cooperate on cybersecurity with a nation that sought to interfere in its last election and, according to U.S. officials\u2019 testimony before Congress, continues to do so ahead of the 2018 elections.\u201cIt\u2019s not the dumbest idea I\u2019ve ever heard, but it\u2019s pretty close,\u201d Sen.       Lindsey Graham       (R., S.C.) said of the proposed unit in an interview with NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s only one person in Washington, that I know of, that has any doubt about what Russia did in our election, and it\u2019s President Trump.\u2026at the end of the day, he\u2019s hurting his presidency by not embracing the fact that Putin\u2019s a bad guy who tried to undercut our democracy.\u201dMr. Graham said the president\u2019s conduct in the meeting strengthened his resolve to pass a measure through Congress bolstering U.S. sanctions against Russia. The Senate passed such a bill last month, although the measure hasn\u2019t passed the House.Establishing such a unit \u201cwould be akin to inviting the North Koreans to participate in a commission on nonproliferation,\u201d Mr. Schiff said. \u201cIt tacitly adopts the fiction that the Russians are a constructive partner on the subject instead of the worst actor on the world stage.\u201dMr. Trump also said Sunday that he and Mr. Putin didn\u2019t discuss U.S. sanctions on Friday.\u201cSanctions were not discussed at my meeting with President Putin,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cNothing will be done until the Ukrainian & Syrian problems are solved!\u201dThe White House has previously said that sanctions won\u2019t be lifted until Russia is out of east Ukraine, but Mr. Trump appeared to take the position further by saying Russian sanctions wouldn\u2019t be lifted until the Syria problem is solved as well.Mr. Trump\u2019s tweet also appeared to contradict a statement by his secretary of state two days earlier. Asked whether Mr. Trump had identified any consequences for Russia for its election interference efforts during his meeting with Mr. Putin, Mr. Tillerson told reporters on Friday that the president had noted \u201cactions that have been discussed by the Congress\u2014most recently, additional sanctions that have been voted out of the Senate\u2014to make it clear as to the seriousness of the issue.\u201d\u2014Stephanie Armour and Paul Sonne contributed to this article.Write to Rebecca Ballhaus at Rebecca.Ballhaus@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-09 21:05:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-calls-for-moving-russia-relations-ahead-constructively-1499605644", "news_title": "Trump Says \u2018Time to Move Forward\u2019 With Russia After Putin Talks", "keywords": "cybersecurity,putin,russia,trump,trump tweets,trump twitter,Donald Trump,political,general news,international relations,politics,domestic politics,government bodies,executive branch,elections,national,presidential elections"}, {"content": "When       Tucker Carlson       was getting ready to take over as       Bill O\u2019Reilly\u2019s       replacement at Fox News this spring, he said network boss and         21st Century Fox               Executive Chairman       Rupert Murdoch       told him, \u201crelax and enjoy yourself.\u201dRelaxation and enjoyment may have been in short supply inside the halls of Fox News over the past year. Turbulence from sexual-harassment scandals led to the exits of the network\u2019s two top executives,       Roger Ailes       and       Bill Shine,        and its biggest star, Mr. O\u2019Reilly.It raised the prospect among media observers that Fox News\u2019s 15-year run of dominance in cable news could be in jeopardy. Not so fast. Fox may be looking over its shoulder more at rivals CNN and MSNBC, but it has kept its hold on No. 1.The network finished the quarter that ended in June first in total prime-time viewers and first among those 25 to 54 years old, growing 21% in that key demographic compared with the year-earlier period, according to Nielsen. Mr. Carlson has proved a solid replacement for Mr. O\u2019Reilly, at lower cost, and the round-table show \u201cThe Five\u201d is up slightly in the ratings over       Megyn Kelly\u2019s       \u201cThe Kelly File.\u201d Ms. Kelly left for NBC early this year.Fox News co-President       Jack Abernethy       said 2017 has been \u201ca great year by virtually all measures.\u201dStill, the landscape has shifted. Ratings for all three cable networks are up substantially from before the presidential election cycle, but MSNBC is enjoying the most sustained growth, with liberal audiences hungry for a critical point of view on the Trump administration. Its viewership among those 25 to 54 grew by 72% year over year in the quarter that ended in June, narrowing the gap with Fox News considerably.Rachel Maddow\u2019s show is No. 1 in the key demographic and is primarily responsible for MSNBC\u2019s surge in prime time. But others are also recording substantial gains that are contributing to the network\u2019s overall improved performance. \u201cLast Word\u201d with Lawrence O\u2019Donnell at 10 p.m. posted a 97% increase in viewers 25 to 54 in the second quarter compared with a year earlier, the fastest pace in that time slot. He still trails       Sean Hannity\u2019s       \u201cHannity\u201d on Fox News, which increased its 25-to-54 audience 31%.Though Fox is still No. 1, its ratings have eroded somewhat since the quarter that ended in December 2016\u2014coinciding with the end of the election and the departures of top network personalities.In addition to those personnel changes, Fox News parent 21st Century Fox has been dealing with a probe by federal authorities examining whether the company violated securities laws in its handling and disclosure of sexual harassment settlements, according to people familiar with the matter.21st Century Fox, which shares common ownership with The Wall Street Journal parent         News Corp,       has said it is cooperating with the probe. Separately, there are sexual harassment and racial discrimination lawsuits pending that name as defendants top executives who remain at the Fox News Channel. A Fox News spokeswoman said the network is mounting a vigorous defense in those cases.New incidents continue to surface. Last week, Fox Business Network said it suspended on-air host       Charles Payne.       The law firm retained to investigate sexual harassment at the company is now looking into Mr. Payne\u2019s relationship with an on-air guest at the channel.Mr. Payne denies any wrongdoing and says he will defend himself vigorously, his lawyer said.\u201cIt\u2019s been a roller coaster of emotions for everybody,\u201d said Fox News anchor       Martha MacCallum.       \u201cAt the same time we were covering the most tumultuous election we had ever seen we were also going through a lot of tumult here.\u201dBret Baier,        chief political anchor, said he would put his \u201cblinders on\u201d and try to shut out all the bad news around the channel. \u201cI\u2019m not going to tell you it didn\u2019t affect us,\u201d he said. Fortunately, he added, the political news kept coming like a \u201cfire hose,\u201d which made it easier to tune out the internal drama.When Mr. Ailes was forced out last July, Mr. Murdoch named himself executive chairman of the channel. (Mr. Ailes, who denied allegations that he harassed women, died in May.) The media world has been buzzing about whether Mr. Murdoch will appoint another top executive at the network.Mr. Shine was co-president alongside Mr. Abernethy, who continues to hold that title. Mr. Shine resigned amid allegations that he allowed a culture of sexual harassment at the company. He has denied any wrongdoing.In a statement, Mr. Murdoch said, \u201cWe have a great and settled leadership team which I enjoy working with every day.\u201dThe multiple controversies have created complications for ad-sales executives. After the revelations that Mr. O\u2019Reilly had settled multiple sexual-harassment complaints, they had to work quickly to shift several ads from his program to other Fox programs. Mr. O\u2019Reilly has denied any wrongdoing. Fox News remains a big draw for advertisers, ad buyers say, because of its high, stable ratings.Mr. Carlson\u2019s average audience in the 8 p.m. hour since succeeding Mr. O\u2019Reilly is 5% smaller than what \u201cThe O\u2019Reilly Factor\u201d was averaging, according to Nielsen. But Mr. Carlson is besting Mr. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s performance among the desirable demographic of adults 25 to 54, enabling him to earn $14,100 per 30-second ad slot, a 21% jump over his predecessor\u2019s rates a year earlier, according to ad-tracking firm Standard Media Index.Furthermore, Mr. O\u2019Reilly had a deal that paid him $25 million a year while Mr. Carlson makes significantly less, a person familiar with the matter said. Likewise, in the 9 p.m. hour, \u201cThe Five\u201d is less expensive than \u201cThe Kelly File,\u201d the person said.\u201cThey\u2019ve shed a lot of their wage bill,\u201d said       Andrew Tyndall,        a TV-news consultant.Get the latest news and analysis on media and advertising via a daily newsletter, at WSJ.com/CMO.In the wake of Mr. Ailes\u2019s exit, Fox executives have signaled they don\u2019t want to shift away from the programming formulas that have worked, including pugnacious, conservative opinion programs.\u00a0Mr. Carlson recently had lunch in Los Angeles with Lachlan Murdoch\u2014Mr. Murdoch\u2019s elder son and co-executive chairman at 21st Century Fox\u2014and said he was reassured that management will be hands-off. \u201cI haven\u2019t gotten any notes,\u201d he said.Some programming, especially morning show \u201cFox & Friends,\u201d has been a friendly face for supporters of President Trump, and a former Fox News executive said this could alienate viewers who are more traditional Republicans. \u201cThe hard-line GOP are not Trump fans and Fox News is having a little bit of an internal struggle about how to treat that,\u201d the former executive said.Mr. Abernethy declined to comment beyond saying, \u201cwe have the same discussions in our newsrooms that you have in yours and everyone has.\u201dFox has said it is moving aggressively to change its workplace culture following the scandals. It points to hires of more women and minorities, including in key senior positions. The network is also much quicker to respond to complaints, as evidenced in May when it fired on-air personality Bob Beckel within days after learning he made a racist remark to a black technician trying to fix his computer.\u201cWe\u2019re sending signals that we are going to operate differently,\u201d Mr. Abernethy said.Inside Fox News, there is a hope that the drama and distractions are starting to fade.\u201cWe\u2019re all pretty much focusing on the very interesting show that\u2019s happening in Washington rather than the show that is happening here at work,\u201d Ms. MacCallum said.\u2014Suzanne Vranica contributed to this article.Corrections & Amplifications   Rachel Maddow is most-watched among adults 25 to 54 years of age.

All the more reason to look at two new studies tracking student performance in two states with voucher programs\u2014Indiana and Louisiana.Start with Louisiana. Today 7,100 students\u2014nearly 90% of them African American\u2014attend private or religious schools of their parents\u2019 choice thanks to a statewide program that includes vouchers for private schools. In February 2016,       Jonathan Mills       of Tulane and       Patrick Wolf       of the University of Arkansas released a study that found declines in English and math after two years at a private school using a voucher.But that wasn\u2019t the end of the story. Messrs. Mills and Wolf expanded their study to include performance after three years, and when they did the results flipped. Their new study shows that, by the end of the third year, the differences between voucher students and those in public schools had been erased.Meanwhile, researchers Mark Berends and       R. Joseph Waddington       focused on Indiana\u2019s statewide voucher program that now serves more than 34,000 students. The study found that students using vouchers had declines in math and English for the first two years after leaving public school. But the longer these voucher kids stuck around in their new schools, the better they did\u2014surpassing their public school peers in English after four years.These studies are important in rebutting what has been an especially aggressive campaign this year against vouchers by unions and liberal journalists. With President       Trump       and Education Secretary       Betsy DeVos       supporting school choice including vouchers, the campaign is on to discredit them with or without persuasive evidence.Student improvement after the first two years at a new school is also consistent with common sense. Parents and teachers know that changing schools can be a big adjustment for children, and private schools typically have different cultural mores and teaching habits. Most parents don\u2019t look for private schools if their children are prospering in their current school.It\u2019s also a mistake to judge a voucher program entirely on standardized tests. There are many other indicators\u2014from personal safety, to discipline, graduation rates and speciality curricula. The idea behind state performance tests is to give parents and taxpayers a way to judge how well schools are teaching and hold them accountable.But education choice\u2014whether in charters or vouchers\u2014comes with the built-in accountability that they must compete to attract students, and parents can withdraw their children if they are unhappy. Even if test scores aren\u2019t notably different, why should the default be keeping kids trapped in public schools rather than letting parents make the choice?These new studies should give a boost to those who believe accountability comes from parents who know better than a distant education bureaucracy what schools best work for their children.Appeared in the July 10, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-07-09 19:40:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-evidence-on-school-vouchers-1499639024", "news_title": "New Evidence on School Vouchers", "keywords": "political,general news,education,private education,school,editorials"}, {"content": "Many Wall Street traders have lamented the steady demise of floor trading.

The exchange, whose electronic platform has one of the smallest market shares in U.S. options, is trying to build up its business by vying for orders executed via open outcry.While trading floors have dwindled in almost all markets because of a shift to electronic trading, old-fashioned shouting and hand signals in open pits have endured in the options market, where investors sometimes prefer human traders to execute complex orders rather than computer programs.It would be a needed respite for floor traders, many of whom have sought new jobs since screen-based trading took off in the 1990s.             Intercontinental Exchange Inc.,       which owns the New York Stock Exchange, ended floor trading for options on futures in 2012, and             CME Group                   closed most of its futures trading pits in 2015. The largest options exchange, Chicago Board Options Exchange, has seen its floors thin to about 440 people earlier this year from 10 times that in the late 1980s.Box\u2019s initial plan, though, sparked critical letters this year from Chicago Board Options Exchange owner,             CBOE Holdings Inc.,       and the NYSE, as well as trading firms that said another trading venue will make it tougher to do business as activity potentially becomes less transparent and more fragmented.Nasdaq Inc.,       which also operates options exchanges, has filed three comment letters about its concerns. A main one is that a Box trading floor, if approved, could sit empty for a few months, potentially leading to worse prices for customers if not enough market makers are competing. Since trading firms take time to get new people trained and registered, Nasdaq argues that Box shouldn\u2019t be allowed to open until the traders, known as \u201cmarket makers,\u201d are ready to participate.\u201cHaving an empty room would be completely contrary to the spirit of the trading floor,\u201d said       Kevin Kennedy,        head of U.S. options at Nasdaq, in an interview.The Securities and Exchange Commission plans to make a decision on the new floor by Aug. 2, documents show.Open outcry accounts for about 13% of U.S. options trading, according to Burton-Taylor International Consulting, which advises exchanges. Most trades are done electronically. Over 350 million options contracts exchanged hands in June in the U.S., with about 2% flowing through Box, data from Options Clearing Corporation show. Box is partly owned by         TMX Group,       which operates the Toronto Stock Exchange.Backers of the company\u2019s proposal say it will boost competition among exchanges. Some also say it is Box\u2019s right to try to build market share in the fiercely competitive options landscape, where a select group of exchanges like the NYSE, Nasdaq and Chicago Board Options Exchange run the existing floors.But Box\u2019s efforts have rankled some U.S. options traders, who are already dealing with a labyrinthine market structure. A new open outcry pit would push market makers to staff the new floor and incur higher costs, said       Peter Maragos,        chief executive of Dash Financial Technologies, a broker dealer and technology provider.\u201cWhere\u2019s the benefit for the client?\u201d said Mr. Maragos, whose firm has brokers on the CBOE floor. \u201cWe\u2019re just adding more complexity, more fragmentation.\u201dThe SEC doesn\u2019t restrict the number of exchanges, said Box Chief Executive       Ed Boyle.       It only creates the legal and regulatory requirements that exchanges must follow. He also pointed to the existing 15 venues for U.S. options.\u201cFor someone to make the statement \u2018Why do we need another one?\u2019 is naive,\u201d said Mr. Boyle, who has worked in options since 1981. \u201cIt really comes off as they don\u2019t want additional market competition.\u201dSteve Crutchfield,        the head of market structure for CTC Trading, opposed the new floor in a letter to the SEC. He said that a sparsely populated floor can make it easier for trading firms that handle client orders to seek venues where they get paid commissions, rather than where they can get the best prices for clients. His firm staffs all four existing open-outcry floors.One of the changes Mr. Boyle made in response to criticism was to scrap a requirement for traders to post continuous electronic quotes if they have a floor presence, which others don\u2019t require.Some options traders said the open-outcry model could help investors who want to prevent prices from moving when their large options orders are getting executed.\u201cThere is still a role for human traders,\u201d said Andy Nybo, a director at Burton-Taylor. An NYSE spokeswoman said 25% to 40% of the exchange\u2019s options volume flows through two floors in San Francisco and New York.The number of CBOE floor traders has fallen, but over half of its most lucrative products\u2014including options on the S&P 500 index and CBOE Volatility Index\u2014are carried out on its Chicago floor. Nasdaq still operates an open-outcry pit in Philadelphia. While CME Group closed most of its futures trading floors, it maintains pits for S&P 500 futures and options on futures for everything from the S&P index to hogs and corn.Box isn\u2019t the first exchange to consider a new floor in recent years. Before being acquired by Nasdaq, the International Securities Exchange had considered an open outcry floor but eventually decided against it, said a person familiar with the matter.But its plan has stoked worries that, if approved by the SEC, the new floor could lead to other exchanges trying to launch their own. \u201cApproving the proposal would open the floodgates for every options [exchange] to open empty \u2018trading floors\u2019 in disused office space,\u201d Mr. Crutchfield wrote.Write to Gunjan Banerji at Gunjan.Banerji@wsj.comAppeared in the July 10, 2017, print edition as 'Proposal to Launch Options Trading Floor Stirs Outcry.'", "news_time": "2017-07-09 19:35:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/plan-for-new-trading-pit-triggers-feud-in-u-s-options-market-1499605202", "news_title": "Plan for New Trading Pit Triggers Feud in U.S. Options Market ", "keywords": "box options exchange,cboe,cbot,markets,nasdaq,nyse,open outcry,options trading,sec,stock exchanges,trading floor,u.s. options,Intercontinental Exchange,ICE,CME Group,CME,Nasdaq,NDAQ,Chicago Board of Trade Building,CTC Trading,Box Options Exchange,CME Group Cl A,Chicago Board Options Exchange,CBOE Holdings,CBOE,TMX Group,CA:X,Kevin Kennedy,Peter Maragos,Ed Boyle,Steve Crutchfield,plans,strategy,corporate,industrial news,derivative securities,commodity,financial market news,stock options,machinery,construction machinery,financial investments,securities,commodity exchange activities,financial services,industrial goods,investing"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014Senate Republicans returning from a July 4 recess are so divided over a health-overhaul bill that they are also struggling to agree on what to do if they fail to pass their legislation.Some conservative lawmakers say an implosion of the Republican legislation would give them a chance to return to their goal of fully repealing the Affordable Care Act, putting off until later a decision about what system to put in its place. Others, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.), are considering the possibility of legislation to shore up the law\u2019s marketplaces where individuals buy health coverage, action that would involve working with Democrats.The focus on possible steps to take if Senate Republicans can\u2019t unite around a health bill is the strongest sign yet of the growing pessimism about the fate of the GOP legislation and the party\u2019s seven-year pledge to topple the ACA. Some Republicans now say a vote to pass a bill could stretch beyond August, if there is a vote at all.Sen.       Bill Cassidy       (R., La.) said Sunday on Fox that he has reservations about the bill. Mr. Cassidy, a physician, was one of three Republicans who held town hall-style meetings over the July 4 congressional recess. He gives the bill a 50-50 chance of passing this month.The weeklong recess has only made Senate Republicans\u2019 path toward health legislation harder, with lawmakers returning to Washington facing at least one more defection and negotiations sputtering between conservatives and centrists. Sen. John Hoeven of North Dakota told a local newspaper that he doesn\u2019t support the current legislation, joining nine other members who had already come out against it.In addition, Mr. McConnell\u2019s suggestion over the break that lawmakers would have to act to stabilize health-insurance markets if GOP senators can\u2019t agree on legislation drew sniping from within his own party.Negotiations over changes to the bill to bring more Republicans on board have reached an apparent standoff. Conservatives, like Mike Lee of Utah, are insisting on a provision that would let insurers sell cheaper, less-comprehensive plans. But centrists have signaled they would oppose such a measure, fearing it would erode protections for people with pre-existing health conditions.The intraparty divide presents a tough obstacle for Mr. McConnell. Republicans initially aimed to get health legislation to President       Donald Trump\u2019s       desk by early April, according to a presentation by GOP leaders. Then a vote was planned for just before the recess, but Mr. McConnell, of Kentucky, was forced to postpone it.Now a vote, if one occurs, would likely come in mid-to-late July, with Congress\u2019s August recess serving as the next deadline. If that fails, the legislative calendar would only get more difficult.While the ACA funds expansions in health coverage with taxes on health industries and high-income households, the GOP bill does the reverse. It would repeal taxes and lower projected government spending toward Americans\u2019 health coverage while phasing out the ACA\u2019s Medicaid expansion and cutting Medicaid more broadly. It would reduce the ACA\u2019s tax credits for low-income consumers and would let states get waivers from some insurance regulations. It also would scale back ACA requirements imposed on employer-based health plans.The most conservative senators say the bill doesn\u2019t go far enough toward repealing the ACA, while more centrist lawmakers such as Sen.       Susan Collins       of Maine worry that it guts too much of the current law and takes coverage from too many people.The legislation would leave 22 million more people uninsured in a decade compared with the ACA, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.As Republicans struggled to unite behind a bill, Mr. Trump said in late June that if they can\u2019t, they should pass a bill repealing the ACA, sometimes called Obamacare, and then work on a replacement. He reiterated that message in a tweet on Sunday. Mr. McConnell has shown little enthusiasm for that idea, and some Capitol Hill aides say Mr. Trump\u2019s suggestion has complicated the ability to get legislation passed.The majority leader, who presides over a narrow 52-48 majority, can afford to lose two GOP votes and still pass the bill, with Vice President       Mike Pence       breaking a potential 50-50 tie.Mr. McConnell hoped to assemble a revised bill over the recess but, publicly at least, Senate Republicans seem at least as polarized as before. Mr. Hoeven said he is concerned the bill doesn\u2019t do enough to help low-income people in his state and those with pre-existing conditions.Still, he said he hopes health-care legislation, possibly composed of multiple bills instead of one, would pass.\u201cI think there\u2019s a number of ways to do it, but we\u2019re going to have to make sure that between Medicaid and the refundable tax credit that we have a good option for low-income individuals,\u201d he said in an interview last week.Conservatives responded sharply to Mr. McConnell\u2019s suggestion that Republicans, presumably working with Democrats, would have to pass a measure to stabilize the insurance markets if they couldn\u2019t agree on their own health bill. Such efforts could include continuing billions of dollars in payments to insurers to offset their costs for providing subsidies that lower out-of-pocket costs for low-income consumers. Mr. Trump has threatened to stop those payments.\u201cIf the Republican Party wants to work with Democrats to bail out Obamacare, the results will be catastrophic for the party,\u201d said Michael Needham, CEO of Heritage Action for America, the lobbying arm of the Heritage Foundation, the conservative group. \u201cFor seven years it has pledged it is the party of repeal, and now is the time to work toward that goal.\u201dA recent proposal from Sen. Ted Cruz (R., Texas) has also provoked divisions. It would let insurers that sell plans complying with ACA regulations also sell health policies that don\u2019t.Health analysts say that would likely cut premiums for younger, healthier people, who would buy more limited policies, while causing premiums to rise for people with pre-existing conditions who would buy the more comprehensive plans that comply with the ACA.Conservative groups are insisting the Cruz proposal be a part of the Senate legislation. Mr. Cruz\u2019s plan has been sent to CBO, which is expected to provide an analysis of its financial and coverage impact as early as this week, according to a person familiar with the talks.Mr. Cruz has said that providing additional choices would lower premiums for many, and that sicker people would still have options. \u201cUnder this amendment, the protections for pre-existing conditions remain there,\u201d Mr. Cruz told a Dallas television station.But Democrats said the plan would create a bifurcated system with insurance becoming increasingly expensive for older, less-healthy individuals. \u201cThis is nothing more than a two-track system for making Trumpcare even meaner,\u201d said Sen.

But it acknowledged in a statement a slowdown, calling it \u201cexpected\u201d after the tax change and a \u201cshort-term\u201d challenge.\u201cTesla welcomes government policies that support our mission and make it easier for more people to buy electric vehicles; however, our business does not rely on it,\u201d Tesla said. The company said its sales in China, where it faces large tariffs, has risen without government incentives. \u201cAt the end of the day, when people love something, they buy it,\u201d it said.Tesla last week said it sold more than 22,000 cars world-wide\u2014either Model S sedans or Model X sport-utility vehicles\u2014in the second quarter, up 53% from a year earlier but short of analyst estimates and the 25,000 it sold in the first three months of 2017. The company said a battery-pack production shortfall affected deliveries.Tesla\u2019s stock dropped sharply in the wake of last week\u2019s results, which fueled concerns among analysts and investors that demand for Tesla\u2019s current two models is weakening ahead of the launch of the Model 3, a $35,000 sedan. Chief Executive       Elon Musk       said on Twitter over the weekend that production of the Model 3 had started.Buyers of Teslas and other electric vehicles in many markets benefit from government incentives. Tesla notes on its website that U.S. purchasers are eligible for a $7,500 federal income-tax credit, plus additional incentives in some states.Norway has exempted electric vehicles from a range of charges, including import taxes, a 25% value-added tax and the purchase taxes that apply to\u200b gas-powered vehicles, according to Tesla. Those policies have helped make Norway, with a population of around 5 million, one of Tesla\u2019s biggest markets, ranking second in revenue in 2015 and third last year after the U.S. and China, according to the company.\u200bIncentives vary\u200b elsewhere in Europe. Germany\u200bexempts electric vehicles from circulation taxes for a decade, while the U.K. exempts such vehicles from an annual circulation tax and full electric cars are exempt from a company car tax, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers\u2019 Association.Tesla warns investors in securities filings that such incentives can change and says that \u201ccould have some impact on demand for our products and services.\u201dLast year in Denmark, an incentive program expired and was replaced with a less generous one.\u200bNew car-registrations for all-electric vehicles of all brands fell 70% in 2016\u200bin the country to 1,373 vehicles, while across the European Union the number grew by 7% to 63,278 vehicles. In the first quarter of this year, only 48 all-electric vehicles were registered in Denmark.The incentive policies can be controversial. During the Obama administration, Tesla received loans to encourage electric-vehicle development. Though it ultimately paid them back, critics have cited that assistance in arguing Tesla unfairly benefited from U.S. government help.Mr. Musk has rejected such contentions, saying during an analyst call in May the notion that his company has survived because of government subsidies and tax credits \u201cdrives me crazy.\u201d Tesla says on balance, industry incentive structures still benefit traditional, combustion-engine vehicles.Hong Kong, though relatively small, is\u00a0a significant outpost of luxury-car buyers and trend setters. Its government had long waived its vehicle-registration tax for newly purchased electric automobiles, adding to the attractiveness of Tesla\u2019s cars.Citing increased congestion of privately owned vehicles on its streets, the government said in February that it would be changing the policy so the tax would be waived only on the first 97,500 Hong Kong dollars (US$12,500) of an electric car\u2019s purchase price for individuals.The Hong Kong registrations data don\u2019t show actual sales figures but are a close proxy because new cars in Hong Kong must be registered to be driven.In May, only five privately owned electric vehicles were registered, according to documents provided to district council members and viewed by the Journal.Tesla said it continues to sell vehicles in Hong Kong each quarter and expects \u201cthe Hong Kong market will continue to be very strong over the long-term because it\u2019s clear that the people of Hong Kong love our cars.\u201dThe reversal in Hong Kong comes as Tesla is planning to expand in mainland China, the world\u2019s largest new-car market. Last month, Tesla said it was exploring with the Shanghai city government the possibility of opening a manufacturing facility in China. China charges a 25% duty on all imported cars.Dave Sullivan,        an analyst for the consulting firm AutoPacific Inc., said the Hong Kong decline could foreshadow challenges for Tesla as a luxury brand in China.\u201cHong Kong is the fashionable China,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not exactly painting a glowing picture for the future of Tesla in China.\u201dWrite to Tim Higgins at Tim.Higgins@WSJ.comAppeared in the July 10, 2017, print edition as 'Tesla Grinds to Halt in Hong Kong.'", "news_time": "2017-07-09 19:14:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/teslas-hong-kong-sales-gutted-by-tax-change-1499598003", "news_title": "Tesla Sales Fall to Zero in Hong Kong After Tax Break Is Slashed", "keywords": "electric vehicles, elon musk,hong kong tax incentives,model s, model x,tax breaks,tesla,Tesla,TSLA,Ford Motor,F,General Motors,GM,Elon Musk,Mark Webb-Johnson,financial performance,earnings,sales figures,corporate,industrial news,government finance,government budget,taxation,economic news,motor vehicles,alternative fuel vehicles,automotive,technology"}, {"content": "MOSUL, Iraq\u2014Prime Minister       Haider al-Abadi       congratulated Iraqi military forces during a visit here following nearly nine months of battle to oust Islamic State, meeting with commanders and greeting residents, with the extremists confined to a tiny patch of territory.But he stopped short of declaring a final victory on Sunday. Mr. Abadi\u2019s visit had raised expectations that he would announce the full recapture of the nation\u2019s second-largest city, but Iraqi forces were still battling Islamic State fighters on Sunday over a narrow strip of land near the Tigris River.\u201cVictory is settled and remaining Daesh [fighters] are trapped in the last spans,\u201d Mr. Abadi said, using another name for the ruthless Sunni Muslim militant group after meeting with security commanders at the Nineveh province operations command. \u201cIt\u2019s only a matter of time [before] we announce the big victory to our people.\u201dIslamic State\u2019s defeat in Mosul would deal it a major military, psychological and political blow. It was in Mosul that it achieved perhaps its greatest military victory, its forces capturing the northern city in just four days in early June 2014, handing the Iraqi military a humiliating defeat and sending shock waves through the region.The official declaration was likely to come Sunday evening or Monday, said Lt. Gen.       Sami Al Ardhi,        a counterterrorism commander who attended the meeting with Mr. Abadi.\u201cOur troops are advancing now, and we hope to have them finish their task tonight or tomorrow,\u201d he said. \u201cIraqi Army troops need a day or two to finish their duty.\u201dDespite the slowness of the final advance, only one area that Iraqi counterterrorism forces are responsible for clearing remained in Islamic State control by Sunday evening, Sabah Al Numan, spokesman for those forces, told state television.\u201cThere is nothing left except making sure that the last area, Al Qulai\u2019at, is empty of terrorists,\u201d he said. \u201cThe whole world is awaiting the moment of the announcement of official victory in Mosul by Prime Minister Abadi.\u201dThe Iraqi army is responsible for clearing other areas north of Al Qulai\u2019at, and hasn\u2019t yet completed that task, counterterrorism commanders said.\u201cWe came today to do a field supervision and supervise the battle,\u201d Mr. Abadi said. \u201cThe terrorists have no way to escape but to die or surrender. Eventually the battle is settled, and the big victory is in hand.\u201dSen.       John McCain       (R., Ariz.), the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, called the Mosul campaign a significant success, but cautioned that eliminating Islamic State for good would require a more sustained commitment from Iraq and a U.S.-led coalition that is backing the fight.\u201cA comprehensive post-Mosul strategy is the only way to ensure that the defeat of [Islamic State] will be enduring,\u201d he said. \u201cWe cannot afford for Mosul to turn out like Libya, where we squandered a long and brutal military success by walking away before winning the peace.\u201dIslamic State lost its administrative grip over Mosul in October, when government forces pushed it from the eastern half of the city, and its ultimate defeat here after more than three years of savagery was all but a foregone conclusion.In its final days, the terrorist group mustered only a couple hundred fighters, cornered on a tiny patch of territory on the western bank of the Tigris River.Iraqi forces have in recent days been bogged down as they fight to advance through the sliver of Iraq\u2019s second-largest city still under Islamic State control. U.S.-backed Iraqi troops have fought to clear the final Islamic State-occupied pockets of Mosul\u2019s Old City.The remaining Islamic State fighters in west Mosul, who commanders say are mostly foreigners, have had more than two years to entrench themselves in the dense neighborhood, where they are falling back on increasingly desperate tactics, including using women as suicide bombers to attack Iraqi forces.On his tour of the nearly won city, Mr. Abadi visited Mosul\u2019s eastern half, which has in large part returned to normal life since being recaptured by Iraqi forces in February. A number of residents there waved flags from their cars and honked. Small groups of people set up loudspeakers and danced in front of Mosul University and in a central commercial area of the eastern city.Islamic State seized Mosul in a 2014 blitz that saw it capture roughly one-third of Iraq\u2019s territory. The ensuing battle has displaced hundreds of thousands of people and killed several thousand Islamic State militants and Iraqi troops and civilians, according to government authorities and the United Nations.Near the front lines in the Old City of west Mosul on Sunday, the smell of rubber and exhaust hung in the air as Iraqi forces prepared to make their final push. Buildings were mostly leaning or fallen, their windows knocked out and interiors battered while streets were littered with rubble and the twisted shells of cars.Loaders and other heavy machinery cleared paths for Iraqi soldiers, who appeared at ease ahead of the recapture, despite staccato bursts of gunfire nearby. Humvees patrolling the area rolled over downed electrical lines in a stark reminder of the toll the siege has taken on Mosul\u2019s infrastructure and the likely high cost of rebuilding the city and resuming basic services there.The U.S.-led coalition on Sunday said it had carried out two strikes near Mosul that destroyed 21 Islamic State fighting positions.In a forward headquarters outside the Old City, Iraqi counterterrorism forces commanders in black fatigues chain-smoked, drank coffee and gestured at a huge map taped to the wall that showed the progress of the battle.\u201cWe believed we would win from the very beginning, just as Daesh knew they would be defeated, and that\u2019s what happened,\u201d said Abdulwahab al-Saadi, a top commander of counterterrorism forces.But Islamic State is far from vanquished in Iraq and elsewhere in the region, and the sense of grievance that gave rise to the group, animated it and made it a world-wide scourge continues. It still controls small swaths of Iraq and large stretches of neighboring Syria. Its members and followers, more dispersed than ever, are likely to pose a terrorist threat in Baghdad, the Middle East and beyond for years to come.Write to Asa Fitch at asa.fitch@wsj.comAppeared in the July 10, 2017, print edition as 'Iraqi Premier Visits Nearly Retaken Mosul.'", "news_time": "2017-07-09 19:05:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/iraqi-prime-minister-arrives-in-mosul-to-declare-citys-liberation-from-islamic-state-1499610523", "news_title": "Iraqi Prime Minister Praises Forces\u2019 Near-Ouster of Islamic State From Mosul", "keywords": "iraq,iraq violence,isis,islamic state,mosul,syria,political,general news,national,public security,crime,legal action,politics,international relations,domestic politics,terrorism"}, {"content": "LAS VEGAS\u2014Bantamweight champion       Amanda Nunes       was scratched from her title defense against       Valentina Shevchenko       after being hospitalized Saturday a few hours before UFC 213.The UFC cited \u201cillness\u201d\u2014without elaborating\u2014in its statement. On Sunday, Nunes said sinusitis was the reason she was dropped out.Nunes said she felt out of breath during her weight cut and \u201cfelt off balance from the pressure in my sinuses. I was not feeling well enough to risk getting punched in the head with such pressure.\u201dNunes revealed her condition in postings on Twitter and Instagram.Yoel Romero\u2019s       interim middleweight title bout against       Robert Whittaker       became the main event of the pay-per-view show at T-Mobile Arena, although the UFC also offered ticket refunds to fans.After Nunes was hospitalized, UFC President Dana White said 115-pound champion       Joanna Jedrzejczyk       lobbied him to give her a late-notice fight against the 135-pound Shevchenko.The Nevada Athletic Commission would never allow such a thing, but Jedrzejczyk and Shevchenko already fought each other three times in muay thai competition during their martial-arts careers.Nunes (14-4), a 29-year-old Brazilian fighting out of Florida, claimed the 135-pound belt from       Miesha Tate       last July. After Nunes stopped       Ronda Rousey       in December, she was scheduled to make her second title defense in a rematch of her March 2016 victory over Shevchenko (14-2), who is also 29.Instead, for the third straight year, the UFC has been forced to cancel the main event of its annual International Fight Week show on short notice.Last July,       Jon Jones       was removed from his bout against       Daniel Cormier       three days before UFC 200 for violating the promotion\u2019s antidoping policy. Jones was slapped with a one-year suspension, but his rematch with Cormier is scheduled for July 29 at UFC 214 in Anaheim, Calif.The UFC also made multiple changes to its July 2015 main event at UFC 189, eventually showcasing       Conor McGregor\u2019s       victory over Chad Mendes.UFC 213 lost its likely main event for the first time in late May when men\u2019s bantamweight champion       Cody Garbrandt       decided his back injury wouldn\u2019t allow him to prepare for a bout against T.J. Dillashaw.In the Romero-Whittaker fight, the 26-year-old Australian recovered from a hyperextended knee in the first round to beat Romero. Whittaker earned a 48-47 victory on all three judges\u2019 scorecards.As the UFC interim middleweight champ, Whittaker earned the chance to fight for the full 185-pound title held for the past year by       Michael Bisping,        who is injured.Romero\u2019s aggression kept Whittaker on the defensive for much of the first two rounds, but Whittaker landed several impressive strikes. Whittaker increased his striking output while Romero sat back in the third and fourth, with Whittaker also defending Romero\u2019s takedowns adroitly.Romero was cut on his left eyebrow and the right side of his scalp, while Whittaker had a bloody nose and mouth in the final round, which was fought largely on the feet. Romero slipped onto his back with 90 seconds left, and Whittaker jumped on top to rain down blows.The 40-year-old Romero was gracious after his eight-fight winning streak ended, praising his opponent.\u2014Copyright 2017 the Associated Press", "news_time": "2017-07-09 19:02:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/amanda-nunes-hospitalized-for-illness-ufc-213-substitutes-main-event-1499548601", "news_title": "Amanda Nunes Hospitalized for Illness; UFC 213 Substitutes Main Event", "keywords": "amanda nunes,bantamweight,ufc 213,ufc main event,valentina shevchenko,Amanda Nunes,Joanna Jedrzejczyk,Robert Whittaker,Valentina Shevchenko,Yoel Romero,combat sports,sports,recreation,routine general news"}, {"content": "New York City subway riders arriving late to the office, missing a school pickup or running late for a doctor\u2019s appointment, take heed: You aren\u2019t alone.That is according to the city\u2019s comptroller       Scott Stringer       who on Sunday released the results of a new survey which found that 74% of New York City subway commuters reported arriving late to work or a meeting in recent months, and 65% were delayed in picking up or dropping off a child at school.Some 71% of the 1,200 riders surveyed at 143 subway stations across the city from June 13 to June 26 said they experienced delays at least half the time they rode the subway.Nearly three-quarters of surveyed riders gave the Metropolitan Transportation Authority a \u201cC\u201d grade, or lower, for overall service, with one in seven riders giving the MTA an \u201cF,\u201d according to the survey.The subway system is \u201cin crisis,\u201d Mr. Stringer said, calling for a top-to-bottom review and massive reorganization of the MTA. He also called on lawmakers to push for a $3.5 billion bond act to provide much needed capital for the MTA to take on significant infrastructure repairs, including modernizing an aging signal system.\u201cEvery option must be on the table,\u201d Mr. Stringer said. \u201cThere\u2019s a real human cost to subway delays and we all know that transportation is our lifeline to our jobs, to our families and our kids.\u201dAt a separate press conference Sunday afternoon, MTA chairman       Joe Lhota       said he hadn\u2019t seen Mr. Stringer\u2019s report, and that his focus for the coming weeks would be to guide riders using New York Penn Station through a rough summer of commuting due to an extensive repair project and to prepare both a 30-day and a 60-day plan for New York Gov.

The Russians want to help their client       Bashar Assad       win back all of Syria while retaining their military bases. If they are now talking about a larger cease-fire, it\u2019s only because they think that can serve Mr. Assad\u2019s purposes.

The U.S. fired cruise missiles in response and has since shot down an Assad airplane bombing U.S. allies on the ground, which drew a threat of Russian reprisal if the U.S. did it again.

To wit, rewriting laws to protect one of their own from a recall campaign.Veto-proof supermajorities in both legislative chambers allow Democrats to raise taxes without GOP support. In April the legislature raised the gas tax by 12 cents a gallon and imposed a new vehicle-registration fee. This spurred a petition to recall Democratic state Senator       Josh Newman,        whose district straddles Orange, San Bernardino and Los Angeles counties.Republicans have targeted Mr. Newman because he voted for the tax hike and is one of two Democratic Senators in a competitive district. While the district has traditionally leaned Republican, changing demographics now give Democrats a slight edge and Mr. Newman won by 2,500 votes in November.Democrats could do a lot of mischief in three years before Mr. Newman faces re-election. Governor       Jerry Brown       hopes to use his supermajority to extend the state\u2019s cap-and-trade program to fund his bullet train. The 2018 gubernatorial frontrunner,       Gavin Newsom,        is running on single-payer health care, which would require Democrats to raise taxes.Worried they could lose their supermajority, Democrats are rigging the recall rules. Turnout in special elections typically drops more for Democrats than Republicans. So Democrats last month passed legislation adding procedural hurdles that would delay the recall election from this fall to next June\u2019s midterm primary, when liberal turnout is expected to be higher.Democrats are also imploring the state\u2019s Fair Political Practices Commission to upend a campaign-finance law that voters approved in 2000. The commission has since applied the limit on individual contributions ($4,400 this year) to legislators who give to fellow politicians being recalled\u2014including in 2008 when Democrats unsuccessfully tried to oust then-GOP State Senator       Jeff Denham       to obtain a supermajority.Yet Democrats now say legislators should be allowed to donate unlimited sums to their colleagues. The rule change would allow legislators in safe liberal districts\u2014nearly all of them\u2014to direct hundreds of thousands of dollars to Mr. Newman\u2019s campaign.This is rich, coming from a legislature that put a referendum on the ballot last year seeking to overturn the Supreme Court\u2019s Citizens United decision, which allows unlimited independent expenditures.

This year the value of the private currency bitcoin has climbed to unprecedented levels, while at the same time becoming far less volatile than in previous periods of rapidly increasing demand. Bitcoin has reached these new benchmarks despite news that might have depressed its value, such as the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s rejection of a fund permitting small traders to invest in bitcoin on the stock market.The SEC action prompted obituaries, but bitcoin is thriving. A prime reason is the distrust many citizens have in their government\u2019s currency. They want to use bitcoin as a hedge or an alternative mechanism of payment and transfer when government currency doesn\u2019t efficiently perform such basic functions. It\u2019s no surprise that millennials, many of whom understand the digital currency much better than their baby-boom forbears, are investing in bitcoin at far greater rates.All modern fiat currencies depend on trust in a government for their value and stability. Some governments have institutions, like the U.S. Federal Reserve, that inspire substantial trust, but others have monetarily oppressive regimes many citizens want to bypass. Argentina continually debased its currency until last year. China puts burdensome restrictions on transferring its currency out of the country. Both countries have seen substantial trading in their respective bitcoin exchanges.Unlike national currencies, bitcoin does not depend on a regime that can be corrupted by politics. With bitcoin, trust is required not in government but in the decentralized order of those who verify bitcoin transactions\u2014the so-called miners. They maintain what is popularly known as the \u201cblockchain\u201d\u2014a public ledger on the internet of all bitcoin transactions, which accounts for the ownership of every bitcoin in existence.The innovation of bitcoin is creating a decentralized process to update the blockchain as new transactions in bitcoin occur. Anyone with internet access can attempt to update the blockchain by employing substantial computer power to solve a mathematical problem. The miner who succeeds in solving the problem gets the rights to add a block of recent transactions to the blockchain. In return for this work, the successful miner is paid in newly minted bitcoin, the number of which is fixed by a pre-existing algorithm. This process is repeated every 10 minutes or so, assuring an accurate record of all bitcoin transactions.Bitcoin miners serve another important role. As with any currency, sometimes the rules governing bitcoin\u2019s operation need to be tweaked. With fiat, governments pass laws or issue administrative decrees. With bitcoin, new code is adopted when the community of miners reaches a consensus on the change.Bitcoin miners sometimes disagree about how best to meet the demands of the market, as shown by a current dispute about the optimal size of each block. But the genius of bitcoin is that because miners are paid in bitcoin, their incentives are strongly aligned with bitcoin\u2019s value. Government officials, by contrast, might not face such strong incentives to maintain the value of their national currency. In developing nations, sometimes those interests include taking valuable property in exchange for an abuse of their power. In developed ones, job retention, promotion, and ideological perspectives can all distort official behavior. Money has been described as a social contract, but politicians charged with enforcing that contract often have incentives to advance their own interests or those of particular political factions at the expense of their legal duties.Bitcoin\u2019s creation of order without centralized law is not unknown to society. Social norms often regulate behavior without the benefit of formal law. Rules of etiquette tell people how to behave at the table without causing offense. But while order without law is possible without software, software can improve its enforcement. One might ignore a social convention, but it is impossible to ignore the operation of an algorithm that tells the world whether you own a bitcoin.To continue to flourish, bitcoin does not have to become a more stable store of value than the U.S. dollar. It can climb the rungs of respectability by prevailing over less trustworthy currencies. It is already gaining strength and stability by competing successfully against monetarily oppressive regimes and helping poor immigrants in the developed world remit money to their relatives back home. As bitcoin gains stability, it can become even more competitive because even the best fiat money is subject to political risks.National and international crises will continue to fuel bitcoin\u2019s rise. The instability caused by problems with the euro, Brexit and the many Western democracies\u2019 growing ratio of debt to gross domestic product threatens the value of even established currencies. Bitcoin is likely to succeed so long as the value of other moneys rests on politics.Mr. McGinnis is a law professor at Northwestern University.

It did so even though it had negotiated a restructuring agreement with creditors that would have saved $2.2 billion in debt service that could have been used to invest in modernizing the utility.In a democratic, market economy that would be weird. But Puerto Rico is now run by a seven-member, unelected federal board under the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management and Economic Stability Act, or Promesa, passed by Congress last year. On June 27 that board unilaterally rejected the restructuring agreement, leading the company to declare bankruptcy.The board\u2019s takedown of the Prepa deal is part of its wider drive to excuse Puerto Rico from tough negotiations with creditors and instead give creditors a crew cut. An adviser to the Ad Hoc Group of General Obligation Bondholders of Puerto Rico told me in April they were close to a deal with the commonwealth in which each side would make concessions. But the oversight board came in at the 11th hour to stop negotiations and imposed a fiscal plan that leaves minimal funds for debt service.Behind these decisions is a belief that if the commonwealth can clear its balance sheets by giving creditors only a fraction of what they are owed, Puerto Rico\u2019s access to the capital markets will resume. Seriously.Advocates of empowering this Washington junta say bondholders are getting what they deserve for buying the triple-tax-exempt debt even though the island\u2019s fiscal picture was deteriorating. Yet even before Promesa, bondholders were on schedule to take losses. The difference is that under the shelter of federal intervention, the rule of law has been politicized and creditors have been stripped of their rights. Bondholders are crying foul, but the real losers are Puerto Ricans.Puerto Rico\u2019s constitution stipulates that general-obligation bondholders must be paid before San Juan uses its revenues for any other purpose. By leaving bondholders only the budgetary crumbs, the fiscal plan effectively green-lights the violation of the constitution. It also violates the Promesa requirement that the board approve a plan that \u201crespect[s] the relative lawful priorities or lawful liens, as may be applicable, in the constitution, other laws or agreements\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201dPromesa also recognized the Prepa restructuring by expressly exempting any \u201cpreexisting voluntary agreement.\u201d Yet the board ignored this constraint on its power when it dissolved the agreement last month, as Assured Guaranty has noted in a complaint filed in federal district court in Puerto Rico on June 26.Four members of the oversight board now say they nixed the Prepa agreement because they have a plan to privatize the company and the restructuring deal would scare off investors.In a June 23 op-ed in the Puerto Rican daily El Nuevo D\u00eda,       Stephen Spencer,        financial adviser to the Prepa Bondholders Group\u2014whose members own some 40% of the company\u2019s bonds\u2014rejected the claim that the restructuring would mean the company could not attract private capital.Even if the board is right, it is hardly a justification to trample creditor rights or violate the Promesa law. Doing so increases legal uncertainty on the island and is unlikely to produce the desired result of faster growth through investment. Three years after Detroit declared bankruptcy, it is still not able to access the capital markets without the backing of the state of Michigan. Puerto Rico has no such backstop.The quid pro quo for bankruptcy was supposed to be fiscal discipline. But that\u2019s not happening, according to       Ojel Rodr\u00edguez,        a research analyst for the San Juan think tank Fundaci\u00f3n Libertad. In a March post co-authored with his colleague       Andresen Blom,        he said \u201cthe government has defined most of the budget as essential services, meaning that any serious restructuring of the island\u2019s finances amounts to basically reducing [debt service]\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0often directly in conflict with Promesa and the Puerto Rican Constitution.\u201d On Wednesday Mr. Rodr\u00edguez told me by email that rather than seriously cutting expenditures, the political class on the island is now \u201cpassing the buck to hard-pressed taxpayers.\u201dIn a June 13 letter to oversight board Chairman       Jose B. Carri\u00f3n III,        Sen.       Tom Cotton       of Arkansas warned that the board\u2019s fiscal plan \u201ccreates a dangerous precedent that property and investor rights are open to interpretation in a fiscal crisis.\u201d Mr. Carri\u00f3n responded in a June 22 letter that the plan is the best alternative. In a telephone call last week Mr. Cotton told me that he remains concerned about the board\u2019s treatment of the rule of law.Bringing fiscal discipline to Puerto Rico will be politically costly. Stiff-arming creditors is more fun. But in an economy heavily dependent on access to capital markets, it\u2019s bound to produce more pain than gain.Write to O\u2019Grady@wsj.com.", "news_time": "2017-07-09 18:21:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/puerto-ricos-broken-promesa-1499638891", "news_title": "Puerto Rico\u2019s Broken Promesa", "keywords": " bondholders, debt, oversight board, prepa,promesa, puerto rico,plans,strategy,corporate,industrial news,corporate restructuring,economic performance,indicators,bankruptcy figures,economic news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,commentaries,opinions,electricity,gas utilities,utilities"}, {"content": "In 2011       Jeff Madrick       published \u201cAge of Greed: The Triumph of Finance and the Decline of America, 1970 to the Present.\u201d This year,       Pankaj Mishra       published \u201cAge of Anger: A History of the Present.\u201d I think the present age should instead be called the \u201cAge of Post,\u201d because in recent years more and more writers have used words with \u201cpost\u201d as a prefix to argue that there has been a dramatic change in the world\u2019s economic, religious and intellectual landscape.Many \u201cpost-words\u201d have been around for centuries, but in the past year post-words have become increasingly popular.

A year after the Boston Tea Party and six months before Concord Bridge,       Dunmore\u2019s       War\u2014the final conflict of the colonial era\u2014broke out, pitting Indian against colonist. In his new book, military historian       Glenn Williams       argues convincingly that this war deserves close examination, even though it was over in five months and resulted in only one major engagement.By Glenn F. Williams  (Westholme, 393 pages, $35)The war drew its name from Virginia\u2019s last colonial governor,       John Murray,        fourth Earl of Dunmore, who took office in 1771 as tensions mounted between the ever westward-pushing settlers and the encroached-upon tribes. A shrewd if rapacious Scot, Dunmore had quickly moved to strengthen his somewhat unsteady fortunes when he came to the New World the year before with an appointment as royal governor of New York, earning a 51,000-acre land grant on the shores of Lake Champlain. Now, as governor of Virginia, he cast his eyes west for himself and his colony to the Ohio Country, which Virginia legally claimed, largely through the deplorable 1768 Treaty of Fort Stanwix. Under the treaty, the Six Nations of New York\u2014the Iroquois Confederacy\u2014had ceded to the British crown great tracts of land along the Ohio River in southwestern Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Kentucky. Although the Six Nations had never occupied the Ohio Country, they claimed suzerainty over the Shawnee, who did. The enraged Shawnee did not assent to the treaty or receive any of the payment it stipulated, the richest purse ever bestowed upon the Indians by colonists.In late 1773, when       Daniel Boone       led a contingent of would-be settlers into Kentucky, Shawnee warriors ambushed a small supply party, torturing and killing Boone\u2019s 17-year-old son. From there, violence escalated. The following year, Dunmore mobilized the Virginia militia, sending two columns totaling 2,500 men to destroy Shawnee villages. Vastly outnumbered, the Shawnee, led by Chief Cornstalk, decided to strike the southern column before the two militia forces could join together. At Point Pleasant, in modern-day West Virginia, where the Ohio and Kanawha rivers meet, the Shawnee inflicted significant casualties on the Virginians but in the end had to fall back. Fearful that the invaders would wipe out their villages, Cornstalk sued for peace, which came only when he surrendered virtually all his lands in the Treaty of Camp Charlotte.By Glenn F. Williams  Westholme, 393 pages, $35Mr. Williams, a historian at the U.S. Army Center of Military History, argues that the often-touted view of the war\u2014land-ravenous Virginians pressing in upon innocent Shawnee seeking to protect their homeland\u2014is simplistic: It does not acknowledge the part played by the Iroquois Confederation and the Cherokee, the struggle over Ohio lands between the Virginia and Pennsylvania colonies, and the intrigues of the British Indian Department. Yet he ventures too far\u2014and against current scholarship\u2014in the other direction by arguing that Dunmore\u2019s was not a war of aggression but rather a defensive war, sparked by unprovoked barbarian depredations but pursued through an offensive strategy. He considers that, by 1774, an Indian war in the Ohio Country had become \u201cinevitable,\u201d a dangerous term for any historian. To him, Chief Cornstalk was set on war, although contemporary documents clearly show him to be a man of honor, moderation and peace, continually overriden by the rampant greed, distrust and violence of the frontier.The peace treaty that Dunmore forced upon the Shawnee, Mr. Williams writes, \u201cproved far less draconian than one would expect from an aggressor bent on land acquisition through conquest and genocidal extermination.\u201d While Dunmore indeed stopped the militia from burning down Shawnee towns, he had accomplished what the colony had wanted all along: ridding itself of the last major obstacle to settling the Ohio Country. Any provisions for punitive action written into the treaty, as Dunmore must have realized, would make Shawnee cooperation more difficult. For them, the peace was quite humiliating enough.This is a soldier\u2019s history, strong when it comes to the business of war but a bit too simple when it comes to matters of the peace. Mr. Williams is at his best in campaign history, mining new primary source material about the organization, training, operations and tactics of the Virginia militia. He shows how its members effectively adapted conventional European tactics to the American woods, learning from Indian fighting techniques and past conflicts to evolve their own brand of bush fighting.Dunmore\u2019s War sufficiently quieted the frontier for the two critical years in which the colonies passed from resistance on particular issues to fighting a united national war for republican independence. Dunmore himself would fight ineffectively for the British and would soon be loathed by the very men he had led into the Ohio Country, many of whom volunteered for service in the Continental Army. Chief Cornstalk would be murdered in cold blood in 1777 by American ruffians, his death doing much to drive the Shawnee to the British side. Just as the sun puts out the stars, the Revolutionary War would dim this last colonial struggle in American memory, but not to the Shawnee, who feel its effect to this day.Mr. Ross is the author, most recently, of \u201cEnduring Courage: Ace Pilot       Eddie Rickenbacker       and the Dawn of the Age of Speed.\u201d", "news_time": "2017-07-09 18:19:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/colonial-americas-final-battle-1499638797", "news_title": "Colonial America\u2019s Final Battle", "keywords": "book review,books,political,general news,arts,entertainment,reviews"}, {"content": "With the       Trump       administration considering how to break the stalemate between Taliban-allied groups and the government of Afghanistan, terrorists detonated a car bomb in Kabul on May 31, killing more than 150. Afghan intelligence blamed the violence on Haqqani, a terror network with close ties to the Taliban, al Qaeda and Pakistan\u2019s spy agency, Inter-Services Intelligence. The attack demonstrates that Washington needs to focus on the threat from Haqqani, which has also consolidated militant factions across strategic regions of the war zone.Haqqani\u2019s ties to Pakistan make political solutions essential. Islamabad has shown no sign it is genuinely willing to end its support of terror proxies and reconcile with the Kabul regime. Yet the success of the administration\u2019s recent decision to deepen U.S. involvement in the Afghan war will depend on whether Haqqani can be defeated, co-opted, or separated from the ISI, which for decades has relied on militant proxies to further Pakistani interests in Afghanistan.Since 9/11, Haqqani has evolved from a relatively small, tribal-based jihadist network into one of the most influential terrorist organizations in South Asia. It is largely responsible for the violence in Kabul and the most notorious attacks against the coalition. It masterminded the 19-hour siege on the U.S. Embassy and NATO headquarters in 2011, and allegedly facilitated an assault on a U.S. Consulate near the Iran border in 2013 and a 2009 suicide bombing of a U.S. base in Khost province, which killed seven CIA operatives. The group also holds five American hostages in Pakistan. Since the 2013 death of Taliban leader       Mullah Omar,        Haqqani has become the only group with the cohesion, influence and geographic reach to provide Pakistan with \u201cstrategic depth\u201d\u2014a territorial buffer on its western border.Pakistan denies sponsoring terror proxies and continues to work with the U.S. in counterterrorism against certain anti-Pakistan groups. But Western and Afghan officials say Islamabad also sponsors terrorism in order to undermine Afghanistan and India. In 2011 Adm.       Mike Mullen,        then chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, called Haqqani a \u201cveritable arm\u201d of the ISI.Haqqani is a central element of the strategic challenge that faces the U.S. and its allies. The network\u2019s expanding operations in northern and southeastern Afghanistan, and especially in Kabul, over the past decade have enabled its Taliban affiliates to \u201ccontrol or contest\u201d territory accounting for about one-third of the Afghan population, or nearly 10 million. That\u2019s a higher proportion of the population than Islamic State controlled in Syria and Iraq at the height of its power in 2014, according to CNN\u2019s       Peter Bergen.       The militants\u2019 wide reach makes it hard for NATO forces to build enduring partnerships with Afghan civilians.As the debate intensifies over how the U.S. should respond in Afghanistan, Washington must also change its approach to Pakistan. As a first step, the president should appoint an envoy who would lead diplomatic and intelligence efforts to buttress the Kabul regime against terrorism. The envoy would also sharpen the focus on Pakistan in bilateral diplomacy with countries that have good relations with Islamabad, such as China, Saudi Arabia and other Persian Gulf states.The envoy would also oversee relations among Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran, Russia and India, focusing on the formulation of political solutions. A U.S. alignment with India would more effectively check Pakistan, while improved U.S. relations with China, cemented over shared concerns about escalating violence and economic security, could pressure Islamabad and its proxies into a political settlement.The U.S. should also press Pakistan to stop providing sanctuary to terrorists. That would require Washington to consider publicly exposing the extent to which officials at the highest levels of the Pakistan military and ISI support terror. Such moves against an ostensible ally would be unusual and would require advanced measures to protect intelligence sources and methods. But the U.S. has tolerated Pakistan\u2019s duplicity for 16 years, and it hasn\u2019t worked.Equally important, the Afghan National Security Forces are unequipped for infiltration by Haqqani factions. The U.S. and NATO allies should increase political intelligence and military resources to ease into a strengthened combat-support role, training and mentoring the Afghan forces. A more adaptive political-military NATO campaign would help reduce the threat from Haqqani, eventually enabling Afghan troops to move from defense to offense against increasingly capable adversaries.Without a broader shift in the U.S. approach to build a more peaceful regional order, the Kabul terror attack may be a harbinger of a more dangerous war to come\u2014one in which Haqqani would play a more important role in the Afghan conflict and global jihad than any other militant network in the region. Pakistan must account for its support of terrorists and face incentives to act more like an ally that would benefit from increased stability in South Asia and beyond.Mr. Nabil served as the head of Afghanistan\u2019s national directorate of security from 2010-12 and 2013-15.

For a policy designed to prevent taxpayer bailouts, it\u2019s an undeniable defeat. In the past few weeks, four European bank failures have demonstrated that a signature feature of the postcrisis regulatory regime simply cannot protect the public. There\u2019s no need for more evidence: \u201cbail-in debt\u201d doesn\u2019t prevent bailouts. It\u2019s time to admit this and move to a simpler solution that will work: more common equity.Bail-in debt was envisioned as an elegant solution to the \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d problem. When a bank ran into trouble, regulators could trigger a conversion of debt to equity. Bondholders would take the losses. The firm would be recapitalized. Taxpayers would be spared.The idea, adopted both in the U.S. and Europe following the 2008 financial crisis, has its share of supporters, including             JPMorgan                   Chase CEO       James Dimon.       \u201cEssentially, too big to fail has been solved,\u201d Mr. Dimon insisted in a shareholder letter earlier this year. \u201cTaxpayers will not pay if a bank fails.\u201d Wall Street also prefers this debt funding rather than equity because it is better for bank share prices. In theory, taxpayers and stockholders both win.The problem is that it rarely works this way in real life. On June 1, the Italian government and European Union agreed to bail out Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena with a \u20ac6.6 billion infusion, while protecting some bondholders who should have taken losses. Then on June 24, Italy decided to use public funds to protect bondholders of two more banks, Banca Popolare di Vicenza and Veneto Banca, with up to \u20ac17 billion of capital and guarantees. The one recent case in which taxpayers were spared was in Spain, when Banco Popular failed on June 6.The largest of these four banks was less than one-tenth the size of $2.5 trillion JPMorgan. Think about that: If bail-in debt couldn\u2019t protect taxpayers from a midsize bank failure when the global economy is stable, what are the odds it will work if a Wall Street giant runs into trouble when the economy looks shaky? Or how about when several giants are in trouble at the same time, as in 2008? Don\u2019t hold your breath.Why are governments so reluctant to force losses on bondholders? Sometimes they fear financial contagion. The argument holds water in the case of too-big-to-fail banks: If creditors at one large institution face losses, creditors at others may fear the same and try to pull their funding. Once the dominoes start falling, they are very hard to stop. This is why the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department, with the support of Congress through the Troubled Asset Relief Program, intervened so dramatically to arrest the 2008 crisis.When systemic risk isn\u2019t an issue, governments may worry that bondholders are politically important constituents. In the recent Italian examples, the banks weren\u2019t considered too big to fail, but the bondholders were retail investors. Regulators claimed that this was a unique circumstance, but there always seem to be unique circumstances when bailouts are concerned. What will happen if an important pension fund faces losses?This is one more reminder that only equity can be counted on to protect taxpayers\u2014and it needs to be raised in advance of economic distress. Although capital standards for America\u2019s largest banks are higher now than before the last crisis, they are not nearly high enough. The odds of a bailout in the next century are still nearly 70%.Large banks need to be able to withstand losses of around 20%, according to a 2015 analysis by the Federal Reserve. But they have only about half that amount in equity because regulators have generously assumed bondholders would take losses. Italy demonstrates that this is wishful thinking. Too big to fail is alive and well, and taxpayers are on the hook.There is bipartisan support for fixing the problem, but it will require forcing large banks to raise much more equity. They won\u2019t do it on their own, because their stock prices benefit when the public takes the risk. Indeed, banks are now moving in the wrong direction by increasing their dividends and stock buybacks. As a country, we must decide what\u2019s more important: protecting taxpayers or bank investors.Mr. Kashkari is president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis and a member of the Federal Open Market Committee.", "news_time": "2017-07-09 18:17:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-bailouts-prove-too-big-to-fail-is-alive-and-well-1499638636", "news_title": "New Bailouts Prove \u2018Too Big to Fail\u2019 Is Alive and Well", "keywords": " bail-in debt, bailout, bank, captial requirements, equity, federal reserve, financial regulation,too big to fail,JP morgan chase,JPM,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,commentaries,opinions"}, {"content": "One often-overlooked benefit of the U.S. energy boom: The federal government receives billions of dollars in royalties annually. Thanks to property rights, so do millions of Americans. Over the past decade, for example,             Cabot Oil & Gas Corp.       has dished out $1 billion in royalties and $500 million in signing bonuses to Pennsylvania landowners in Susquehanna and Wyoming counties.In fiscal 2016, Washington collected $3.9 billion in royalties from oil and gas production on federal land and offshore\u2014and that\u2019s down from $6.6 billion in 2015, according to a new report from the Government Accountability Office. Lower energy prices contributed to the decline, but so did the Obama administration\u2019s roadblocks on drilling-permit applications.The Congressional Research Service reports that federal lands produced 1.57 million barrels of crude oil a day in 2008. By 2015 that had risen 25% to 1.955 million. But over the same period production on nonfederal land more than doubled from 3.467 million barrels a day to 7.46 million.The contrast was starker for natural gas. Federal lands produced 6,471 billion cubic feet in 2008, but that number shrank to 4,594 billion by 2015. Over the same period production on nonfederal lands grew from 14,523 billion cubic feet to 24,143 billion.The difference is even more pronounced when you realize that the royalty rate is typically much higher on state and private land. Oil and gas producers are required to pay 12.5% to drill on federal land. Royalties on state land are usually in the range of 16% to 18%. In Texas, the largest producer, the typical rate is 25%. Royalties on private land often reflect the state rate.Why would producers flock to state or private land rather than cheaper federal land? Because time is money. The Bureau of Land Management took an average of 307 days in 2011 to process applications for drilling permits. States can give approval within a few months.The National Association of Royalty Owners, a trade group, estimates that eight million to 12 million people receive royalties from oil and gas production nationwide. A 2013 study by       Timothy Fitzgerald       and       Randal Rucker,        economists at Montana State University, estimated that in 2012 private owners earned some $22 billion in royalties. Production on private lands has since increased significantly.Mr. Fitzgerald and others estimated later that six major shale plays generated $39 billion in private royalties in 2014.

Meanwhile, a greater threat to America\u2019s news industry looms mostly unnoticed: Google and             Facebook\u2019s       duopolistic dominance of online advertising, which could do far more damage to the free press than anything the president posts on             Twitter.The rapid growth of digital connectivity has pushed demand for information to unprecedented heights. Never in history have so many people consumed so much news. This is a boon for democracy. Although reporting is often an irritant to those in power, high-quality news and analysis is essential to any political system that depends on giving citizens the facts so they can draw their own conclusions.The problem is that today\u2019s internet distribution systems distort the flow of economic value derived from good reporting. Google and Facebook dominate web traffic and online ad income. Together, they account for more than 70% of the $73 billion spent each year on digital advertising, and they eat up most of the growth. Nearly 80% of all online referral traffic comes from Google and Facebook. This is an immensely profitable business. The net income of Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, was $19 billion last year. Facebook\u2019s was $10 billion.But the two digital giants don\u2019t employ reporters: They don\u2019t dig through public records to uncover corruption, send correspondents into war zones, or attend last night\u2019s game to get the highlights. They expect an economically squeezed news industry to do that costly work for them.The only way publishers can address this inexorable threat is by banding together. If they open a unified front to negotiate with Google and Facebook\u2014pushing for stronger intellectual-property protections, better support for subscription models and a fair share of revenue and data\u2014they could build a more sustainable future for the news business.But antitrust laws make such coordination perilous. These laws, intended to prevent monopolies, are having the unintended effect of preserving and protecting Google and Facebook\u2019s dominant position. The digital giants benefit from legal precedent against collective action that has a chilling effect on publishers. Yet each newspaper or magazine on its own has only limited negotiating power.Antitrust enforcers have declined to address Google and Facebook\u2019s growing dominance, enabling the digital giants to roll up the information economy. The Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department let Google take over the online ad industry by buying Doubleclick, AdMob and AdMeld, as well as mapping competitor Waze. Regulators allowed Facebook to acquire two direct competitors, Instagram and WhatsApp.The News Media Alliance, which represents digital and print publishers (including Dow Jones, publisher of The Wall Street Journal), is proposing a solution: a new law granting a limited safe harbor under antitrust for publishers to negotiate collectively with dominant online platforms. This would grant media organizations the flexibility to expand innovative digital models of news distribution, while also giving them more ways to sustain high-quality journalism.A safe harbor would be less necessary if U.S. antitrust enforcers opted to apply the existing laws. European regulators already have begun to act, slapping Google with a $2.7 billion fine for violations of fair competition. So far, however, their counterparts in Washington have largely watched from the sidelines.The unique role news media continue to play in American politics and history makes it crucial to ensure a fairer fight for revenue between news publishers and these massive information gateways. Today, antitrust laws are insulating Google and Facebook from market forces. News publishers are committed to unleashing those forces to defend their investments in great journalism.Mr. Chavern is president and chief executive of the News Media Alliance, a trade association representing approximately 2,000 newspapers in the U.S. and Canada.Appeared in the July 10, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-07-09 18:15:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-antitrust-undermines-press-freedom-1499638532", "news_title": "How Antitrust Undermines Press Freedom", "keywords": " advertising, antitrust, duopoly, facebook, google, intellectual property,journalism, media, money, monopoly, news, publishers, revenue,Facebook,FB,corporate crime,legal action,regulation,government policy,marketing,markets,advertising,anti-competition issues,corporate,industrial news,regulatory breach,social media marketing,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,commentaries,opinions,digital marketing,internet search engines,public relations,business,consumer services,internet,online,media,entertainment,social media platforms,tools,technology"}, {"content": "The first name of researcher Jay Blundon of St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital in Memphis, Tenn., was incorrectly given as John in the Mind & Matter column Saturday on early learning in mice.PacifiCorp has filed plans with state regulators to spend $3.5 billion on wind and transmission projects.

More than 5,000 firefighters were dispatched across the state on Sunday, according to the California Department of Forestry & Fire Protection, or Cal Fire.The largest fire, known as the Alamo Fire, started Thursday afternoon east of Santa Maria, in the dry, mountainous terrain on the northern edge of the national forest. Residents of Santa Maria, a city of around 100,000 people, posted photographs on social media over the weekend of flames and smoke billowing from the massive blaze.As temperatures soared Friday and Saturday, the fire spread quickly, reaching 24,000 acres by midmorning on Sunday, with only 10% contained, state officials said. Gusting winds and hot air complicated efforts to battle the blaze, said Toni Davis, a spokeswoman for Cal Fire.Ms. Davis said midday Sunday that 200 structures were threatened by the blaze, though none had been destroyed and there were no reported injuries.

Under the measure, which was approved by Ohio\u2019s House of Representatives last week, gun owners caught carrying weapons inside court buildings would be subject only to removal from the premises. While many county courthouses have metal detectors at entrances, security can be less tight in courthouses in rural areas.Since 2013, more than a dozen mostly Republican-led states have considered measures easing courthouse restrictions, although generally guns are still banned inside individual courtrooms. Proponents of these eased laws say they are about securing the rights of law-abiding gun owners to protect themselves in public places.But the more expansive bills have met resistance from people concerned that allowing firearms in courthouses would invite trouble. Security fears were underscored by eruptions of violence inside and outside courthouses in recent years, including shooting incidents in Delaware, Texas and South Carolina, in which gunmen opened fire at estranged relatives and, in an attack near Dallas, in which a prosecutor was targeted.The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized an individual\u2019s right to bear arms under the Second Amendment but hasn\u2019t ruled on what degree it might extend to carrying concealed weapons into public places.That has left the issue over the scope of gun bans to statehouses across the country, where they have been hotly contested. Even among Republicans in red states with looser gun laws, the idea of lifting courthouse gun restrictions is controversial.\u201cCourthouses can be very emotionally charged places,\u201d said       Bill Raftery,        a senior analyst with the National Center for State Courts. \u201cIt\u2019s a public building, but it\u2019s a place that has prisoners being transported and highly charged emotional cases and situations.\u201dIn May, Florida lawmakers tabled a \u201ccourthouse carry\u201d bill that would have permitted gun owners to carry their weapons into judicial premises and then store them with security officials. Arkansas legislators debated but set aside a bill that would have allowed concealed handgun licensees to possess guns not only in courthouses but courtrooms.The bills that passed are narrower in scope. Arkansas lawmakers in March voted to allow state employees who work at county courthouses and have concealed-carry permits to carry firearms into the buildings. This spring, Oklahoma\u2019s Republican-led Legislature passed a law permitting elected county officials who are licensed gun owners to carry concealed weapons into courthouses as long as they are \u201cacting in the performance of their [public] duties.\u201dThe broader issue has led to clashes between branches of government and between courts and gun-rights activists.Last year, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton sued a county northwest of Houston for posting signs barring gun owners from entering its main courthouse carrying a firearm. He argued that gun bans should exclude areas of courthouses used by nonjudicial offices. The challenge stalled after a state judge ruled for the county.In some states, like Iowa, courts have pushed to tighten security. Last month, the state\u2019s Supreme Court issued a statewide ban on bringing weapons into courthouses.\u201cWhen Iowans believe their courthouses and court facilities are not safe, the integrity of the entire justice process is compromised and undermined,\u201d said the order signed by Iowa Chief Justice Mark S. Cady.Justice Cady wrote that violence in courthouses is becoming more common and that the order aimed to correct \u201cinconsistent policies and gaps in protection\u201d among local courthouses.Questions about courthouse security in Iowa escalated in 2014 after a criminal defendant in Madison County brandished a handgun during his sentencing hearing. The man fled and was captured.\u201cWe realized how many close calls there were,\u201d said David L. Brown, a Des Moines lawyer who headed a task force on courthouse security for Iowa\u2019s bar association.Some gun activists say the state Supreme Court\u2019s move infringes on the rights of law-abiding firearm owners. The Iowa Firearms Coalition blasted the ban as \u201cjudicial overreach, plain and simple.\u201d The state Supreme Court has \u201czero authority to dictate what happens in the public areas and offices outside of Iowa\u2019s courtrooms,\u201d the group said.In late June, the Woodbury County Board of Supervisors voted against complying with the directive because it feared exposing the county to private lawsuits. The board pointed to a new state law that lets Iowans who are \u201cadversely affected\u201d by a local gun ordinance to sue for damages and injunctive relief.The county board\u2019s decision put it at odds with the local sheriff\u2019s office, which said the supervisors lacked the authority to overrule the state\u2019s high court and vowed to enforce the courthouse gun ban.In the June order, Iowa Chief Justice Cady said the authority for his directive came from the state\u2019s constitution, which gives the Iowa Supreme Court the power to exercise supervisory and administrative control over district courts.Legal questions about courthouse gun restrictions may end up in court, said Skip Kenyon, past president of Iowa\u2019s bar association. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of uncharted territory here,\u201d he said.Write to Jacob Gershman at jacob.gershman@wsj.comAppeared in the July 10, 2017, print edition as 'States Debate Guns In the Courthouse.'", "news_time": "2017-07-09 17:13:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-battlefield-over-gun-rights-the-courthouse-itself-1499634821", "news_title": "New Battlefield Over Gun Rights: the Courthouse Itself", "keywords": "political,general news,society,community,crime,legal action,gun control,social issues,firearms,aerospace,defense,defense equipment,products,industrial goods"}, {"content": "RIO DE JANEIRO\u2014The International Olympic Committee has balked at helping Rio Olympic organizers pay a debt estimated at $35 million to $40 million.The IOC\u2019s executive board, which met Sunday in Lausanne, Switzerland, said it had already contributed a \u201crecord\u201d $1.53 billion to last year\u2019s Olympics and questioned giving more after meeting with the Rio de Janeiro Organizing Committee president,       Carlos Nuzman.\u201cMore detailed information\u201d was needed, the IOC said, and it \u201cdeferred any further consideration at this stage.\u201d It \u201chas closed all its obligations with the organizing committee,\u201d the IOC said.Contractually, host cities and countries are obligated to pay Olympic debts.

Ltd., which oversees more than $350 billion in assets and is the world\u2019s eighth-largest sovereign-wealth fund, said Mr. Trump\u2019s economic record was likely to be a significant risk factor for markets in coming years.Mr. Trump has said he plans to implement a program of deregulation, corporate-tax overhauls and infrastructure spending, but his economic policy agenda has been held up by foreign-policy challenges and an investigation into alleged links between members of the president\u2019s campaign and suspected Russian meddling in the 2016 election.However, despite this and other risk factors\u2014including the U.K.\u2019s planned exit from the European Union and the slow normalization of interest rates in the U.S.\u2014market volatility remains low and valuations are high, GIC said at a briefing on its annual performance. Accordingly, \u201cthere may be investor complacency in the market,\u201d said       Lim Chow       Kiat, GIC\u2019s chief executive. In a statement, he said that \u201cat today\u2019s market valuations, the universe of high-return opportunities has shrunk significantly.\u201dGIC, which manages Singapore\u2019s foreign-exchange reserves, said in its annual report the annualized nominal rate of return from its investments for the 20 years through March was 5.7%, consistent with the figures from last year.For the five years ended in March, GIC said it had an annualized nominal rate of return of 5.1%, compared with 3.7% in the five years ended in March 2016.Its allocations to different asset classes, such as equities, bonds and private equity, remained little changed in the past year but over the past few years it has increased its holdings of cash and nominal bonds and reduced its exposure to more-volatile asset classes, such some riskier equity markets.GIC, which owns large stakes in             Citigroup Inc.       and UBS Group AG doesn\u2019t disclose the size of its assets under management. The fund, which says it takes a long-term view of investing, also doesn\u2019t publish single-year results.The Sovereign Wealth Center estimates its assets at $353.6 billion.A U.S.-led recovery from the 2008 global financial crisis remains fragile, GIC executives said in a briefing. Corporate profits in the U.S. peaked about two years ago and some interest-rate-sensitive sectors such as automobiles are already facing credit-related problems while rates are still relatively low, they said.\u201cIn many senses that is not priced in by the markets\u2014the U.S. market continues to be very close to its highs,\u201d said Jeffrey Jaensubhakij, GIC\u2019s chief investment officer. Mr. Trump\u2019s proposed economic revamps will need to \u201ccome into play\u201d for the markets to continue to do well, he said.The value of the holdings of many sovereign-wealth funds, including GIC, has risen since the global financial crisis as central banks have pursued cheap-money policies that buoyed asset prices. However, the funds are now warning of lower returns in the longer term, with bond yields low and equity markets expensive.The U.S. remains GIC\u2019s biggest investment destination, accounting for 34% of its global allocation, while Japan accounts for 12% and the rest of Asia about 19%.In May, the fund halved its stake in Swiss banking major UBS, which isn\u2019t included in GIC\u2019s latest figures. The fund, which has been one of UBS\u2019s biggest shareholders for much of the past decade, said it would cut its holding to 2.7% from 5.1%, adding it was \u201cdisappointed\u201d with the investment, which resulted in a loss.Mr. Lim said GIC was prepared for protracted uncertainty and low returns. The fund recognizes that to generate a good return, \u201cwe have to be prepared for periods of underperformance relative to the market indices, some even for a stretch of several years,\u201d he said.Write to Gaurav Raghuvanshi at gaurav.raghuvanshi@wsj.com and Jake Maxwell Watts at jake.watts@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-09 17:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/singapores-sovereign-wealth-fund-gic-sounds-note-of-caution-1499634034", "news_title": "Singapore\u2019s Sovereign-Wealth Fund GIC  Sounds Note of Caution", "keywords": " gic, singapore,sovereign wealth fund,GIC,ownership changes,acquisitions,mergers,divestments,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,personal finance,fund markets,commodity,financial market news,trusts,funds,financial vehicles,financial services,investing,securities"}, {"content": "Apple Inc.\u2019s        AAPL 0.63%       iTunes Store\u2014already struggling against rising competition for music listeners\u2014is losing the battle for video viewers as well.The company\u2019s market share for renting and selling movies has been falling for several years, tumbling to between 20% and 35% from well over 50% as recently as 2012, according to people with knowledge of the matter.No third parties track market share in the digital-movie business, making exact figures impossible to obtain. Different Hollywood studios do different amounts of business with Apple, but several of them report a marked decline in iTunes\u2019 leadership position.An Apple spokeswoman, who didn\u2019t dispute the market-share estimates, said Apple is focused on providing customers with video content across subscription services such as             Netflix                   and HBO, as well as iTunes, where she said movie purchases and rentals have increased over the past year and hit their highest level in more than a decade.Apple\u2019s growth appears to be a consequence of overall industry increases, despite its market-share losses. Last year, total U.S. digital-movie sales and rentals rose a combined 12% to $5.3 billion in the U.S., according to PricewaterhouseCoopers.Apple\u2019s challenges in video come as the company looks to double by 2020 its $24 billion services business, which includes App Store sales, Apple Pay and Apple Music. iTunes, where Apple sells and rents films, has served as the foundation of that services business since 2003 when it made its debut as a digital store for music downloads before expanding to include TV shows and movies. Services, the company\u2019s second-largest business, have taken on increasing importance as Apple seeks to reduce its dependency on the iPhone, which accounts for two-thirds of annual sales.iTunes video, music, book and magazine sales last year accounted for an estimated $4.1 billion in revenue, making it the second-largest services business behind App Store sales, which were nearly twice as large, according to estimates by Bernstein Research.Apple\u2019s iTunes has faced a host of rising competitors in recent years in the market for renting and buying new movies online, which typically cost about $6 and $15 each, respectively.One that has had a big impact is             Amazon.com Inc.,        AMZN 0.24%       which in addition to its Prime subscription service rents and sells movies on a \u201ctransactional\u201d basis. Its market share in that business has recently risen to around 20%, studio executives who are involved in home-entertainment sales say, as it has been highlighting its entertainment offerings.Another is             Comcast Corp.      , the nation\u2019s largest cable provider by subscribers, which has long rented movies on its set-top boxes and in late 2013 began selling digital copies as well. It now has about 15% of the combined market, according to people involved in digital movie sales.\u201cComcast and Amazon have been quite aggressive of late and taken quite a lot of the business,\u201d said       Dennis Maguire,        a former president of home entertainment for             Viacom Inc.\u2019s       Paramount Pictures.In addition to steeper competition, Apple faces broader changes in the movie rental and sales market as consumers increasingly watch movies and TV shows offered through streaming-subscription services from Amazon, Netflix Inc. and others. Their popularity is a big reason why video-on-demand movie rental revenue in the U.S. declined 4% to $1.8 billion last year, the first year it has dropped in recent memory, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers. Digital movie purchase revenue grew 21% to $3.5 billion, compared with a 29% increase the prior year.\u201cThat\u2019s a challenge for the whole industry,\u201d said       Bruce Leichtman,        president of Leichtman Research Group, which analyzes the media industry.Apple\u2019s market share declines are independent from the broader slowdown in the business, but both affect the company.The transition mirrors what happened to iTunes\u2019 music business after Spotify AB began offering a subscription service in 2011. Just as Apple responded by launching a $10 music-streaming service in 2015, it is moving to beef up its video offerings in a subscription service. To help make such a service more appealing, Apple recently hired the former chiefs of television for Sony Pictures Entertainment to spearhead a move into original video and has released its first program, \u201cPlanet of the Apps,\u201d which is available along with some other video content to Apple Music subscribers.The company also has tried to capitalize on the broader shift to subscription streaming services by selling subscriptions to Netflix, HBO and others through its app stores, including an Apple TV app store and operating system introduced in 2015. It takes a 15% cut of the subscriptions it sells. The Apple TV app store offers more than 1,300 video channels and 6,000 video, gaming and other apps, which Apple calls the future of TV.Apple\u2019s iTunes struggles come following years of steady growth in the business. After launching iTunes movies in 2006, the company quickly took a dominant position in movie sales and rentals largely because of the success it was already enjoying in digital music sales. No other competitors had as sophisticated an online store or a suite of devices to play its content, like the iPod and Mac. Netflix was still relying on the U.S. Postal Service to mail DVDs to subscribers and entertainment was a tiny business for Amazon.In the decade since iTunes launched movies, other companies offering transactional video-on-demand and movie purchases, in which consumers pay for each piece of content (as opposed to all-you-can-eat subscriptions), have increased the quality of their offerings. Comcast has invested heavily in its X1 set-top box that offers the ability to search on-demand content by voice and Amazon has beefed up its entertainment business.Apple\u2019s loss of market share in the digital movie business isn\u2019t uniform across genres, people who work with the company say. It has promoted independent films and signed deals for exclusive rights to some produced outside the major studio system, making it a stronger competitor in that space.Write to Ben Fritz at ben.fritz@wsj.com and Tripp Mickle at Tripp.Mickle@wsj.comAppeared in the July 10, 2017, print edition as 'Apple Loses Ground in the Digital-Movie Battle iTunes Is Losing Ground in Digital-Movie Battle.'", "news_time": "2017-07-09 16:51:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/apples-itunes-falls-short-in-battle-for-video-viewers-1499601601", "news_title": "Apple\u2019s iTunes Falls Short in Battle for Video Viewers", "keywords": "apple,comcast,download,films,in-app purchases,movies,netflix,on demand,on-demand video,streaming,streaming video,video download,Amazon.com,AMZN,Apple,AAPL,Comcast,CMCSA,Netflix,NFLX,Sony Pictures Entertainment,6758.TO,PricewaterhouseCoopers,Spotify,Viacom,VIA,VIAb,marketing,markets,market share,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,arts,entertainment,music,computers,consumer electronics,broadcasting,cable broadcasting,e-commerce,internet,online,media,technology"}, {"content": "In a Newark jazz club last month,       Lorenzo Morrast       proudly watched as his 16-year-old daughter Alexis delivered a soulful, throaty rendition of an old tune that laments of the tribulations of African-American folk hero       John Henry.\u201cEarly \u201870s was a tough time for the city,\u201d the Newark native said, referring to the period after the summer of 1967, when violence erupted there and in more than 100 other U.S. cities, fueled by long-simmering economic and racial tensions.Fifty years after the riots, some see a future shaped in part by musicians such as Alexis, a jazz phenom who in February won \u201cShowtime at the Apollo,\u201d a competition at Harlem\u2019s legendary theater.Newark today\u2014led by Mayor       Ras Baraka,        whose father was injured in the riots\u2014has some of the trappings of urban revival: A Whole Foods,             Starbucks,       luxury-apartment developments and a restaurant on the horizon from celebrity chef Marcus Samuelsson.Decades ago, Newark was a jazz haven mentioned in the same breath as New York City and New Orleans. Its roster included saxophonist       James Moody,        trumpeter       Woody Shaw       and vocalist       Sarah Vaughan.Clubs, rejuvenated by a post-Prohibition beer-brewing boom and thirst for entertainment, attracted the likes of Charlie \u201cBird\u201d Parker, who recorded for Newark\u2019s Savoy Records, and       Billie Holiday,        whose 1957 run at Newark\u2019s Sugar Hill jazz club was immortalized in a photo book published this year.Events in 1967 marked a turning point for Newark, hastening a population and economic decline, and setting off a downswing for clubs.\u201cThey ran everybody out of the city,\u201d said       Leo Johnson,        a saxophonist who moved to Newark in 1957 at age 17.Clubs would open, the 77-year-old recalled, but it was mostly \u201chere today, gone tomorrow.\u201dNews that a black taxi driver had been beaten by police, some erroneously said killed, on July 12, 1967, primarily sparked the Newark riots.Neighborhoods were destroyed, 26 people died and many more were injured. Images of bloodied bodies, armored trucks and looted stores were carried across the nation.\u201cThat image stayed that way for many years,\u201d said       Ray Chambers,        a Newark-born businessman and philanthropist who has championed several city developments, including the New Jersey Performing Arts Center and the Prudential Center.Mr. Chambers was 24 years old, working in Newark when the 1967 clashes broke out. He recalls the fear and friends\u2014black and white, National Guardsmen and city residents\u2014\u201cwondering how much of a divide would be created and what it would cost to knit [Newark] back together.\u201dLast month, as Mayor Baraka introduced the city\u2019s latest pitch to jump-start the economy: \u201cHire. Buy. Live. Newark,\u201d he noted that, \u201cThere\u2019s much more to do to dispel that ghost.\u201dThe proposal includes targets to hire at least 2,020 Newark residents by 2020 and bring the city\u2019s unemployment rate from 6.7% in May to the state\u2019s level of roughly 4%.Newark, with a population of about 281,000 according to 2016 U.S. Census figures, is a city built on dreams of families who sought better opportunities, Rutgers University-Newark Chancellor       Nancy Cantor       said, \u201cand it is our moral responsibility, as well as good business to make that happen.\u201dEssential to the city\u2019s cultural evolution are organizations such as NJPAC, the Institute of Jazz Studies at Rutgers-Newark\u2014a pre-eminent jazz archive and research facility that moved here before the riots and whose board had drawn such luminaries as       Louis Armstrong,       Duke Ellington       and       Dave Brubeck      \u2014and WBGO, which bills itself as \u201cJazz Public Radio from the Jazz Capital of the World, New York City,\u201d but is Newark-based.Part of an earlier effort to re-energize the city after 1967, WBGO was envisioned as a cultural beacon, said       Robert Ottenhoff,        a philanthropy executive who helped found the station.WBGO is \u201ca story of hope, and a story of people working against the odds,\u201d he said. \u201cI like to think that there are lots of little stories like that in the city of Newark.\u201dOn a recent Friday night at Clement\u2019s Place, a Newark jazz lounge that opened last year during the city\u2019s 350th anniversary, old records covered walls bathed in red and purple.

One of the country\u2019s most popular politicians, Mr. L\u00f3pez was serving a nearly 14-year sentence for allegedly instigating violence at protests in 2014, charges he denies.\u201cAfter all the resistance, all the work, we\u2019re seeing a step that was achieved by this struggle in the street,\u201d his wife Lilian Tintori, told reporters at the rally as she fought back the tears. \u201cWe will continue our fight until the liberation of all political prisoners and justice for the victims\u201d of repression, she said.Ms. Tintori said she started crying when Mr. Lopez was unexpectedly brought home at 3 a.m. on Saturday, accompanied by two top lieutenants of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, siblings Delcy and Jorge Rodriguez. Ms. Tintori said there was no political negotiation to free Mr. Lopez.\u201cIt was a unilateral measure by President Maduro,\u201d she said.Opposition supporters greeted Ms. Tintori with chants of \u201cliberty\u201d and \u201cyes we can.\u201d Many wore T-shirts with signs \u201c100th Day\u201d and portraits of killed protesters.Mr. Lopez\u2019s commuted sentence has confused government supporters and rank and file officials, who have spent years vilifying the opposition leader as the \u201cMonster of Ramo Verde\u201d behind the country\u2019s political violence. Some took to social networks to criticize what they saw as a sign of Mr. Maduro\u2019s weakness.\u201cWe won\u2019t give up,\u201d said Sunday Diosdado Cabello, the hard-line Vice President of the ruling United Socialist Party. \u201cWe will die fighting.\u201dMr. Maduro sought to shift the blame for Mr. Lopez\u2019s jailing on Attorney General Luisa Ortega, who has emerged as his most dangerous opponent in the ruling party in the past few months.\u201cI haven\u2019t moved a finger\u201d on his case, he told supporters at a rally Saturday. \u201cIt was Luisa Ortega who presided over the case.\u201dMr. L\u00f3pez and his lawyers have repeatedly denied all the charges that were leveled against him, which were criticized by all major international rights groups and governments from Europe to the U.S. One of the prosecutors of the case fled to Miami, where he denounced the charges as fake and politically motivated.\u201cLeopoldo L\u00f3pez is innocent,\u201d Franklin Nieves told The Wall Street Journal in 2015 in an interview in which he apologized to Mr. Lopez\u2019s family.The prosecutors claimed at the time that Mr. L\u00f3pez, who wasn\u2019t present in any street clashes with security forces, used \u201csubliminal messages\u201d to push his supporters to violence.The house arrest doesn\u2019t mean Mr. Lopez\u2019s sentence has been overturned, said Carlos Romero, political scientist at the Central University of Venezuela in Caracas. \u201cThe place where he is being jailed has changed.\u201dMr. L\u00f3pez had 48% approval rating in June, compared with Mr. Maduro\u2019s 20%, according to the latest poll from Caracas-based Datanalisis. Another opposition leader,       Henrique Capriles,        topped the poll with a 51% approval.Mr. Lopez plans to meet Mr. Capriles and other opposition leaders in the coming days to coordinate strategy, said Freddy Guevara, national coordinator of Mr. Lopez\u2019s Popular Will party.The commuting of Mr. L\u00f3pez\u2019s sentence comes at a time of rising repression by Mr. Maduro\u2019s government, which has been confronted by rollicking social unrest and a collapsing economy.More than 90 people, mostly protesters, have died in the almost daily demonstrations since April. Last week, government supporters armed with pipes burst into Venezuela\u2019s congress and severely beat several opposition lawmakers.Hundreds of protesters are being tried in closed military courts on treason charges, a move decried by Attorney General Ms. Ortega and international rights groups. There are 431 political prisoners in the country, including a lawmaker and dozens of Popular Will activists, according to local rights group Penal Forum.Mr. L\u00f3pez\u2019s transfer to house arrest \u201cdoesn\u2019t mean the regime is opening up and that a transition is imminent,\u201d said Michael Shifter, president of the Inter-American Dialogue policy group in Washington.\u201cBut I think it does reflect that there has been international pressure,\u201d he said. \u201cSustained international pressure had an impact, and the government felt that it had to do this.\u201dIn what Mr. Maduro has called an attempt to calm the unrest, the government here has called for a vote July 30 for a special assembly, which will have the powers to rewrite the country\u2019s constitution. The opposition and ruling party dissidents say the assembly will be stacked with government supporters and will outlaw elections and political parties. The government\u2019s foes are boycotting the vote.Instead, the opposition alliance will stage on July 16 a parallel, unofficial referendum on the planned constitutional overhaul. About 85% of Venezuelans say they are against changing the country\u2019s constitution, according to the Datanalisis poll.Write to Anatoly Kurmanaev at Anatoly.kurmanaev@wsj.comAppeared in the July 10, 2017, print edition as 'Maduro OpponentsCelebrate A Release.'", "news_time": "2017-07-09 16:32:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/venezuelan-opposition-gather-to-celebrate-release-of-leopoldo-lopez-1499632323", "news_title": "Venezuelan Opposition Gather to Celebrate Release of Leopoldo L\u00f3pez ", "keywords": "caracas,leopoldo lopez,military prison,nicolas maduro,ramo verde,venezuela,political,general news,crime,legal action,politics,international relations,domestic politics"}, {"content": "Though stress-relief dogs and mindfulness sessions make regular appearances on the college calendar these days, professionals still contend with students\u2019 lingering discomfort about seeing a counselor.Mental-health experts say that students from certain cultural backgrounds, particularly in parts of Asia and the Middle East, are less inclined to seek out their services, as are first-year students still worried about fitting in with their new peers.\u201cWe were driven by the wish to reach out to populations where stigma might have made it difficult for people to be comfortable entering the center,\u201d said       Christopher Flynn,        director of the Thomas E.

The University of Iowa is adding a second \u201cembedded counselor\u201d in a residence hall this summer. And Virginia Tech now has satellite counseling clinics in locations including at a graduate student center and above a             Starbucks                   in downtown Blacksburg.In 2016, 14% of the 463 respondents to a survey of university counseling-center directors said they have \u201cembedded\u201d or \u201ccounselor in residence\u201d positions, including in residence halls or academic departments\u2014double the share from 2015.The shift comes as more students with mental-health issues make it to college, often with the help of therapy and medication. As the student population changes, schools are expected to care not just for the intellectual pursuits of those on campus but also their physical and emotional well-being.More than 38% of college students said last fall that in the prior year they had felt so depressed it was difficult to function, and 10.4% had seriously considered suicide, according to a survey of more than 33,500 students by the American College Health Association, a group for school health centers. Those figures were 28.4% and 6%, respectively, in 2010.Depression and anxiety are cited in more than half of visits at the University of Iowa\u2019s counseling center, and the reasons for the rest range from fights with parents or roommates to homesickness to thoughts about self-harm.\u201cIf it\u2019s diagnosable, we\u2019ll see it,\u201d said       Barry Schreier,        director of University Counseling Service at Iowa.The school\u2019s embedded-counselor program launched in a residence hall last year to help students who can\u2019t or don\u2019t want to trek over to the main counseling center across campus, as well as to relieve overwhelmed residence advisers, who are themselves undergraduate students.Rachel Zuckerman,        who graduated from Iowa in May, said that as a resident adviser, or RA, she got some training in how to refer students to counseling services, but often struggled to support peers while juggling her own academic and extracurricular demands.\u201cI was going to class with the weight of feeling like I couldn\u2019t do enough for my residents\u2019 mental health,\u201d said Ms. Zuckerman, 22, who as student body president pushed to bring counselors closer to dorm rooms. \u201cI didn\u2019t know how to cope.\u201dIowa embedded its first counselor in the college of dentistry in 2014, on a part-time basis. By the start of the coming school year, it will have a full-time staffer in the dental school, the equivalent of one full-time and one part-time staffer in athletics\u00a0facilities\u00a0and two counselors in residence halls that mainly serve first-year students. It also now has a support group for RAs, coordinated by an embedded counselor.The first counselor stationed at the residence hall last year \u201cwas inundated almost instantaneously,\u201d Dr. Schreier said, and quickly developed a weekslong waiting list for nonurgent appointments.\u00a0Same-day appointments were still available for emergencies.The Iowa Board of Regents last fall approved a $10.50-a-semester student fee designated for mental-health services, which helped provide funding for eight new counselors across the university. The ratio of counselors to students is now roughly one to every 1,500, compared with the old level of one to 2,800.In-house counseling centers often hold office hours that are more in line with students\u2019 schedules than the main health facilities on campus. At Ohio University, for example, students can drop in for sessions with three counselors in residence\u2014counseling or psychology doctoral students who also live in faculty apartments in the dormitories\u2014between\u00a05 p.m. and 10 p.m.\u00a0every day but\u00a0Saturday.Even schools that have long posted counselors in dorms, like Columbia University, have been making adjustments.\u201cThere\u2019s more of a demand for service, and more of a demand for immediate service,\u201d said       Josette Cline,        director of counseling and psychological services at the University of Arkansas.That school witnessed a 40% jump last year in appointments deemed by students to be \u201cemergencies,\u201d on top of a 9% increase the prior year.The 21-year-old counselor-in-residence program at Arkansas has grown from a few doctoral candidates studying counseling to also include master\u2019s students, referred to as interns, and beginning this month a full-time, senior clinician who can handle more drop-in visits rather than advanced-scheduled sessions.Come fall, Arkansas will begin posting counselors in far-flung corners of campus, including possibly at the engineering school, for informal, even anonymous consultations, part of a program called \u201cLet\u2019s Talk\u201d that was launched at Cornell University in 2006 and has since spread to nearly 50 schools.\u201cWe need some more boots on the ground,\u201d Dr. Cline said.Write to Melissa Korn at melissa.korn@wsj.comAppeared in the July 10, 2017, print edition as 'Counselors Go Where Students Are.'", "news_time": "2017-07-09 16:20:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/college-counselors-go-where-the-students-aredorms-and-starbucks-1499631617", "news_title": "College Counselors Go Where the Students Are\u2014Dorms and Starbucks", "keywords": "college campus,college counseling,counseling services,mental health,stress,student,therapy,undergraduate,political,general news,education,university,college,health care,life sciences,mental health care,healthcare provision"}, {"content": "MALTEPE, Turkey\u2014Turks gathered by the hundreds of thousands Sunday at a seaside park in an Istanbul suburb to excise their anxieties\u2014and anger\u2014over their country\u2019s future.The rally orchestrated by political opposition leader       Kemal Kilicdaroglu       highlights how the issue of justice is consuming Turkey since last summer\u2019s failed coup and the adoption of a state of emergency that President       Recep Tayyip Erdogan       and his Justice and Development Party says is necessary to restore order but that his political opponents contend has been a tool to curb their rights and civil liberties.The theme attracted droves from Mr. Kilicdaroglu\u2019s Republican People\u2019s Party, or CHP, who have been a moribund presence in Turkey\u2019s political life since Mr. Erdogan\u2019s Justice and Development Party won its first election in 2002. Yet it also drew large numbers of people across other sectors of society, from the Turkish heartland as well as those who describe themselves normally as apolitical but who now find themselves sufficiently worried at the course of events since July 2016.Mr. Kilicdaroglu told the crowd that Turks standing united could restore the values of justice and accountability that he believes have been lacking in government. He said that it was time to reverse the wave of arrests, mass firings and closures of dozens of media outlets that have occurred under the state of emergency.\u201cWe walked for nonexistent justice. We walked for the rights of victims, jailed lawmakers and journalists,\u201d Mr. Kilicdaroglu said.Sevem Yilmaz, a homemaker from Gaziantep, brought her four children more than 600 miles to Istanbul out of motivation for this sentiment for the family\u2019s first political event.Mrs. Yilmaz, dressed in shorts with her long brown hair pulled back in a ponytail, lined up before lunchtime along the crowded shoreline road outside the rally venue to secure a spot to see Mr. Kilicdaroglu, who arrived in Maltepe around 6 p.m. at the end of a 25-day walk from the nation\u2019s capital. His protest has gathered steam and respect as the mild-mannered 68-year-old has trekked through the summer heat in what for Turkey is an unusual protest action.By late afternoon, Ms. Yilmaz was still bursting with energy, despite a five hour wait to see the opposition leader, in part because of the carnival atmosphere that permeated Sunday\u2019s gathering. Hawkers sold cotton candy, soda and ice water amid the grueling heat while children played on jungle gyms dotting the seaside boulevard and rode bikes along the two-miles long blockaded street ways secured for the protesters.\u201cThis action is extraordinary. He makes me proud to be Turkish,\u201d Mrs. Yilmaz said about Mr. Kilicdaroglu. \u201cI want my kids to see that justice is worth standing up and fighting for.\u201dOrganizers from Mr. Kilicdaroglu\u2019s CHP said they estimate 1.5 million Turks attended the rally, despite the distant location away from Istanbul\u2019s city center and lack of major public-transportation hubs.Seydi Saydi, a hazelnut farmer from the Black Sea area of Giresun, also journeyed approximately 600 miles with his teenage son and daughter and elderly head-scarfed mother to attend their first political rally. His anger was primarily focused on what he sees as a lack of economic justice.Mr. Saydi said he has been struggling to stay solvent due to a weakening currency and falling prices that government buyers set for his produce. He said the ruling party\u2019s heavy-handed meddling in all corners of Turkish life, including the economy, are to blame for his hardships as well as creating a negative international perception of Turkey.\u00a0\u201cOur future is less hopeful now. We need AK Parti to leave power,\u201d Mr. Saydi said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want a to look like the Arab world, with a dictator sending many innocent people to jail.\u201dUmut Kahraman, a 21-year-old from Bursa who is studying to be a chef, traveled three hours from his hometown to attend the day\u2019s events out of concern for social justice and his perception that the governing party is trying to force its values on the rest of Turkey.\u201cWe are all Muslims here but you wouldn\u2019t know it from the government,\u201d Mr. Kahraman said. \u201cThey are Muslims who want to tell us all what to do and who to be and how to live.

Authorities moved to quell the riots late Friday night only after they had raged for hours, according to several shopkeepers in one of the hardest-hit streets. Unrest continued, to a smaller degree, on Saturday night, as more barricades and vehicles burned in the streets.A police spokesman said intelligence suggesting some of Friday night\u2019s roughly 1,500 rioters were preparing to pelt authorities from buildings with cobblestones and Molotov cocktails had caused the delay in stopping the unrest. \u201cWe had prepared for the G-20 summit to be attacked, not the people of Hamburg,\u201d Hamburg police spokesman       Timo Zill       told ZDF public television.The riot in the Schanzenviertel Friday night appeared to be the most violent flare-up as tens of thousands of people protested across the city. By Sunday, 411 people had been detained and 476 officers injured, according to the police. An unspecified number of protesters were also injured.Hamburg\u2019s Interior minister,       Andy Grote,        on Saturday said the riot had been long-planned\u2014to a degree \u201cwe have never witnessed before\u201d\u2014and that many of the perpetrators were still in the city. Mr. Grote sought to justify the time it took for police to move into the Schanzenviertel. \u201cWe wanted to ensure that by moving it, we wouldn\u2019t put our colleagues\u2019 lives at risk and that we would win the upper-hand,\u201d he said.German politicians had warned of possible violence for months, in part because the summit was held near two of the more radical neighborhoods in a city long a hub of anarchist protest.Officials from the host government have said they needed to hold the annual summit in a metropolitan area to ensure there were enough hotel rooms, and that they wanted to show off one of Germany\u2019s most international cities.But critics claiming the government had miscalculated intensified their attacks Saturday. The conservative opposition leader in the Hamburg legislature,       Andr\u00e9 Trepoll,        slammed center-left Mayor       Olaf Scholz       for going easy on left-wing extremism. The Bild tabloid, Germany\u2019s top-selling paper, said both Mr. Scholz and German Chancellor       Angela Merkel      \u2014who is up for re-election in September\u2014bore responsibility for the events.\u201cThe feeling of general security, which the state must guarantee, has ceased to exist in Hamburg in the last 48 hours,\u201d Julian Reichelt, a top Bild editor, wrote in Saturday\u2019s edition. \u201cThe horrific message of Hamburg is: if the mob wants to rule, it will rule.\u201dAfter the summit ended Mr. Scholz and Ms. Merkel together met with several dozen police officers and thanked them for their work.\u201cSome people exercised unimaginable violence,\u201d Mr. Scholz said. \u201cI thank those who say that it must nevertheless be possible for such summit meetings to take place in cities such as Hamburg and in a democratic country such as Germany.\u201dDemonstrations against the summit continued more peacefully Saturday. More than 50,000 people marched in protest of what organizers described as \u201cthis cold and cruel world of global capitalism.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t immediately clear who the black-clad rioters were. They sometimes marched alongside peaceful demonstrators before attacking property or police. German Interior Minister       Thomas de Maizi\u00e8re       described them as \u201canarchists\u201d from across Europe. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing here is the opposite of democratic protest,\u201d he said. \u201cThese were wanton, extreme acts of violence out of lust for destruction and brutality.\u201dCord W\u00f6hlke, co-head of Hamburg\u2019s Budnikowsky drugstore chain, arrived in the Schanzenviertel about 9 p.m. Friday to see one of his shops being looted. Rioters shattered the windows and tossed items into the street to be burned, he said.The plunder lasted several hours,       Mr. W\u00f6hlke       said, before the police moved in. Few of the rioters spoke German, he said, and Spanish-language graffiti saying \u201csocial war\u201d was left behind. \u201cWe were all worried, but no one expected this level of violence,\u201d he said.U.S. President       Donald Trump,        speaking Saturday at a G-20 event in the city to promote women entrepreneurs, mentioned the street protests. He praised Ms. Merkel and said the summit had largely proceeded \u201cwithout much interruption,\u201d despite \u201cquite a few people\u201d who \u201cseem to follow your G-20s around.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve been amazing and have done a fantastic job,\u201d Mr. Trump told the chancellor.While world leaders were able to hold their talks on Hamburg\u2019s elaborately secured convention center sealed off from the commotion outside, the riots cast a shadow on the summit. On Friday, Mr. Trump\u2019s wife, Melania, was forced to skip an event with leaders\u2019 partners because protests made it unsafe for her to venture outside, her spokeswoman said.On Saturday, French President       Emmanuel Macron       urged leaders to heed the protesters\u2019 concerns.\u201cWe\u2019ve been living in a town for two days that is attacked by hooligans to whom I will give no ground,\u201d Mr. Macron said.

Economists expect the consumer-price index to rise 1.5% from a year earlier and the producer-price index to increase 5.5%, both maintaining the same pace as May. (Data will be released Sunday evening U.S. time.)WEDNESDAY: Business surveys suggest the eurozone\u2019s economic recovery gathered pace in the second quarter, and official figures on activity are starting to support that evidence. Figures from the European Union\u2019s statistics agency are expected to show a 0.8% rise in industrial production in May from the previous month, which would be the largest increase since November 2016. However, there are few signs that more rapid growth is lifting inflation, and the European Central Bank is therefore likely to proceed cautiously when considering a withdrawal of stimulus.Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen will deliver her semiannual monetary policy report to Congress on Wednesday and Thursday. Ms. Yellen has said job growth in recent months has been well above the pace necessary to absorb new entrants to the labor force and that weak inflation numbers largely reflect transitory factors.THURSDAY: China\u2019s foreign trade, a bright spot in the world\u2019s second-largest economy this year, probably remained strong last month. Economists expect exports grew 9% from a year earlier, accelerating from May\u2019s 8.7% rise. Growth in imports probably moderated to 12.4% from 14.8%, widening the trade surplus to $44.2 billion in June, from May\u2019s $40.81 billion.FRIDAY: The Commerce Department releases U.S. retail sales data for June, after sales in the struggling sector fell 0.3% in May, driven by a decline in car purchases and less spending at service stations. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expect sales ticked up 0.1% in June.Economists will watch the U.S. Labor Department\u2019s June consumer-price index for any indication of whether recent weakness in inflation might be transitory, after May\u2019s report showed consumer prices fell slightly. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expect CPI increased 0.1% in June.Later in the morning, the Federal Reserve releases U.S. industrial production data. This measure of output at factories, mines and utilities was unchanged in May from the prior month. Manufacturing, which accounts for the bulk of industrial production, has shaped up as a bright spot in the economy so far this year.

The overall unemployment rate is nearly 10% and about a quarter of young people are\u00a0jobless.However, some managers struck a note of caution, saying firms that have long avoided investing in France could still take years to rev up their activity. Many are on standby until September when Mr. Macron is expected to pass the labor measures into law.\u201cThe fruits of the reform will not come in one year. They will come after two or three years,\u201d said       Antoine Frerot,        chief executive of water and waste management giant             Veolia Environnement SA      .The time frame illustrates why previous French governments have balked at taking the bitter medicine of labor market reform.Since the start of the 2008 financial crisis, Germany and European regulators have demanded that countries along the bloc\u2019s Mediterranean rim boost their competitiveness by stripping away rules protecting workers from being fired, even in an economic downturn. Doing so would lower costs and legal uncertainty for firms and encourage them to hire, European officials say.Left-wing unions, however, say such measures risk opening the floodgates for massive job cuts.Economists have credited overhauls in Spain for helping its job market recover, but results have been mixed elsewhere.\u00a0Mr. Macron wants to avoid the fate of another European centrist, former Italian Prime Minister       Matteo Renzi,        who was counting on his own overhaul of labor rules to spur a job market recovery. Instead, Italy\u2019s jobless rate has remained stubbornly high, and Mr. Renzi resigned last year.Mr. Frerot estimates he added about 100 workers to Veolia\u2019s 2,000-strong\u00a0staff in Italy after the Renzi overhaul, which he says allowed the firm to take on short-term contracts because it could hire staff on flexible terms to complete them.\u201cI\u2019m only comfortable accepting this business if I know I\u2019m not taking too many risks,\u201d he said.Unlike his Italian counterpart, Mr. Macron has some economic wind in his sails.

Josh Gottheimer, a 42-year-old former             Ford Motor Co.       and             Microsoft Corp.       executive, was one of only six Democrats to flip Republican-held House seats last November. He has spent his first few months in office balancing calls from Democrats to resist all aspects of President       Donald Trump\u2019s       agenda with maintaining popularity in his Republican-leaning district, which narrowly voted for Mr. Trump.\u201cI don\u2019t work for the national Democratic party,\u201d Mr. Gottheimer said. \u201cI work for the Fifth Congressional District. There are things that are nonnegotiable, but there are plenty of areas like tax reform and infrastructure and certain regulatory reform that I believe are good for people back home.\u201dMr. Gottheimer highlights in particular his work as co-chairman of the House\u2019s Problem Solvers Caucus, a group of 21 Republicans and 21 Democrats. Members of the caucus vote as a bloc if 75% agree on an issue, Mr. Gottheimer said, and also pay dues and agree not to campaign with or contribute to one another\u2019s campaign challengers. Some members, such as Mr. Gottheimer, come from competitive districts while others represent solidly Republican or Democratic districts.The caucus\u2019s members have met with House Speaker       Paul Ryan       (R., Wis.) and Minority Leader       Nancy Pelosi       (D., Calif.), as well as Mr. Trump and members of his cabinet. Mr. Gottheimer acknowledged that some of his Democratic colleagues wouldn\u2019t take these meetings.\u201cI\u2019ve got to do whatever I can to be at the table,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to take the sit-out, obstructionist approach.\u201dMr. Gottheimer, who won his seat by fewer than 15,000 votes, has already raised about $750,000 in the first four months of this year for his 2018 re-election campaign, according to federal election records. His effort to steer away from partisan battles is a solid re-election strategy given his GOP-leaning district, according to       Sarah Binder,        a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution. \u201cHe really needs to burrow himself into that district, not to address national issues that polarize the parties,\u201d she said.Mr. Gottheimer\u2019s district covers parts of northern New Jersey\u2019s rural Sussex and Warren counties as well as parts of the more suburban Passaic and Bergen counties. The district was formerly held by Scott Garrett, a founding member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus.Mr. Gottheimer\u2019s bid for bipartisanship starts with early-morning workouts led by Rep. Markwayne Mullin (R., Okla.), a former college wrestler who leads bruising cross-training routines attended by about a dozen lawmakers. Participants usually don\u2019t discuss politics in the gym, but the workouts provide the opportunity to build relationships, Mr. Mullin said.At a recent Problem Solvers Caucus meeting, closed to the media, the discussion centered on balancing national-security funding with spending for domestic programs. Members debated how much discretionary spending to support and how to pay for it, Mr. Gottheimer said.His co-chair, Rep. Tom Reed (R., N.Y.), said working with a small bipartisan group and the attractiveness of voting as a bloc has helped him find areas of compromise. He cited defense spending as one area where he has changed his mind.\u201cI\u2019m willing to consider revenue increases in order to get a deal put together with the caucus,\u201d said Mr. Reed, an early backer of Mr. Trump\u2019s. \u201cTypically I would not support that.\u201dMr. Gottheimer, who said he calls or texts Mr. Reed three to four times a week, couldn\u2019t think of a specific policy issue where he has changed his mind since coming to Washington. But he said he has been surprised by the degree of openness lawmakers have to bipartisanship.\u201cI sort of had a perspective that people would not really be open,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you make the effort, there are a lot of people who want to get things done and work together.\u201dMs. Binder said it isn\u2019t clear how effective the bipartisan caucus can be. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard for those groups to get traction in such a polarized Congress,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of legislating going on; when issues do come up they tend to end up in centralized bargaining behind closed doors.\u201dSome of Mr. Gottheimer\u2019s constituents are wary of his willingness to work with Republicans. Jeff Fox, a 66-year-old Paramus resident who founded a local chapter of the progressive grassroots movement Indivisible, said members were glad to see a Democrat elected and support Mr. Gottheimer\u2019s more liberal positions, but are concerned about the effectiveness of his participation in the Problem Solvers Caucus.\u201cIt just feels, more often than not, that the Democrats tend to give in and move more to the right than the Republicans do to the left,\u201d Mr. Fox said, adding that he wants to see the congressman use his discussions with Republicans to push back against the GOP health care bill.Mr. Gottheimer said he is trying to represent the interests of all his constituents regardless of their political affiliations.Other constituents said they were heartened by Mr. Gottheimer\u2019s efforts toward bipartisanship.\u201cAt least he\u2019s working with people,\u201d said Steve Sluka, a 69-year-old Franklin resident and registered Republican. \u201cI want him to go to the table, I want him to try to work with the Republicans to try to work on a good health care plan and start working on tax reform.\u201dWrite to Kate King at Kate.King@wsj.comAppeared in the July 10, 2017, print edition as 'Lawmaker Looks for Middle Ground.'", "news_time": "2017-07-09 14:31:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/freshman-new-jersey-congressman-takes-a-bipartisan-path-1499624730", "news_title": "Freshman New Jersey Congressman Takes a Bipartisan Path", "keywords": "political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,elections,national,presidential elections"}, {"content": "DENVER\u2014In an increasingly competitive business world, prospective bankers and executives need every edge they can get. That\u2019s why people like Kashious Vela have opted for a specialized camp this summer, where he will learn about economics, financial markets and theories of international trade.He is also 8 years old and starting third grade later in the year. He\u2019s unapologetic about why he\u2019s devoting his summer to high finance when many children his age will be playing sports and singing campfire songs.\u201cI like money,\u201d said Kashious, who goes by Kash. \u201cAnd you could get really rich.\u201dKash is one of 85 children between the ages of 7 and 11 who traveled from around the country to Denver in June for the Junior Money Matters camp. These campers come for a week inside classrooms, spending seven hours a day studying things like the U.S. current-account deficit and supply and demand dynamics.Teaching economics and finance to this age group demands patience, creativity and the occasional bribe. Camp counselors punctuated lessons with clapping exercises meant to recapture errant campers\u2019 attention, lunchtime sessions of the tag game \u201cSharks and Minnows\u201d and plenty of Cheez-Its and Capri Sun juice packs. In arts and crafts, they made piggy banks.During lectures, some children squirmed in their seats or attempted to wander around, promptly attended to by counselors who promised to hand out colorful stickers if they were quiet. Others didn\u2019t need much coaxing to participate.\u201cHow do countries make money?\u201d a camp counselor asked during one day\u2019s international trade lesson.\u201cBy suing people!\u201d one boy shouted.The nonprofit Young Americans Center for Financial Education has offered a program for fourth-, fifth- and sixth-graders since 1990. But the center concluded the real growth area is in children who have just started losing their baby teeth. Enrollment in Junior Money Matters\u2014for those who have completed second or third grade\u2014rose to a record 247 campers this summer, according to the center. It is one of several camps, including Camp Millionaire, Youth About Business and the Future Investor Clubs of America, that cater to the money-minded and their offspring.Spencer Smith, a 9-year-old from nearby Castle Pines, is a first-timer at the Denver camp. But he is already looking ahead, explaining he wants to \u201cwork with money\u201d when he grows up.\u201cWhen you train puppies, it\u2019s better to train them when they\u2019re younger,\u201d he noted. \u201cIt\u2019s the same with people.\u201dMadison Grider, a 10-year-old camper from Centennial, Colo., aspires to attend Harvard University and medical school. That\u2019s not going to come cheap. She said she has already started saving money for her tuition, and has learned how to write checks, exchange currencies and withdraw money from a savings account at camp.\u201cWhen you grow up you don\u2019t have to learn it\u2014you can just do it,\u201d Madison said.This capitalist training ground can be challenging. Two hours into the third day of camp, one child retreated to a corner of an empty room, crying while waiting for a counselor to call his mother. Counselors don\u2019t necessarily have financial backgrounds; most have experience in youth programs or nonprofit work.Jennifer Starr said her 8-year-old daughter, Brooke, wanted to go to camp after her older sister enjoyed attending a field trip with a similar itinerary.Brooke said it was as much her mother\u2019s idea as her own. \u201cMy mom sent me here to learn more about money and see what it\u2019s like to be a grown-up,\u201d said Brooke, decked out in a soccer jersey and soccer-ball earrings.As some parents see it, the weeklong immersion in business and finance could mean a leg up for their children over more-indulged peers.\u201cSpencer is only 9, but is interested in becoming an accountant and has always been interested in money concepts and saving his own money. We want to foster that,\u201d said Sara Smith, a senior vice president at a network of hospitals who drove her son through an hour of traffic so he could attend.On the children\u2019s agenda: practice how to exchange \u201cAmeriDollars\u201d for \u201cPacAsia\u201d notes (stopping by a corner of the room designated \u201cSingapore\u201d to conduct the exchange) and form countries to barter for natural resources printed on laminated cards.During an hourlong trade lesson, a group in the back corner took the opportunity to practice their best fake-flatulence noises. Over in the Netherlands, tensions were rising. One boy made off with all of the country\u2019s metal, fruits and vegetables, sugar, electronics and textiles, leaving his fellow citizens with nothing to trade.\u201cThey won\u2019t be quiet,\u201d said Spencer, as the rest of his temporary countrymen\u2014who had dubbed themselves \u201cThe Weirdos\u201d\u2014dashed across the room to exchange their minerals for another country\u2019s sugar.\u201cFidget, fidget, fidget,\u201d said one camper who remained seated, clutching an orange fidget spinner, a popular rotating toy, as others scrambled to even out their country\u2019s balance of trade.The Denver program\u2019s curriculum sprang from the vision of the late       Bill Daniels,        a cable-TV pioneer who felt government interference could strangle business, according to the website for his philanthropic foundation. The camp aims to instill a love of free enterprise early in childhood, for $235 a week. Representatives for the camp said its curriculum is nonpolitical.Richard Martinez Jr., president and CEO of the center, said early on, his neighbors asked him why he was sending his children to \u201cbank camp\u201d when he put them in the program. But times have changed for current campers, he said.\u201cEspecially today with everything going on around the world right now\u2014talk of trade deals, immigration\u2014it\u2019s really playing out firsthand,\u201d he said. \u201cI see they\u2019ve learned about supply and demand today and ask them to tell me about that, and boy, they just go crazy.\u201d He said he isn\u2019t expecting every camper to become an investment banker, but it is important children learn about economics and personal finance early.At the end of the week, campers ran a simulated town for a day, some filling out applications for positions at a post office, auto shop, bank and newspaper. They went to work at mock offices and shops, built using funds from corporate sponsors, emblazoned with logos including those of             McDonald\u2019s Corp.      ,             United Parcel Service Inc.,       Janus Henderson Investors, Cambiar Investors and             Comcast Corp.Some children are already dreaming of other careers.Even Kash, who professed his affection for money, doesn\u2019t see himself working on Wall Street or occupying a corner office. \u201cWhen I grow up, I want to race cars!\u201d he said.Write to Akane Otani at akane.otani@wsj.comAppeared in the July 10, 2017, print edition as 'Most Camps Have S\u2019mores; This One Has Finance.'", "news_time": "2017-07-09 14:10:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/most-camps-have-smores-but-this-one-has-lessons-on-finance-and-trade-1499623828", "news_title": "Want Your 7-Year-Old To Be a Banker?

Average asking rents for ground-floor space on Greenpoint\u2019s Franklin Street corridor hit $89 a square foot in the first quarter of 2017, a 42% jump from the $63 a square foot recorded in the same period the previous year. Ground-floor asking rents on the downtown Fulton Street section rose 8% to $325 a square foot, the report said.However, Williamsburg\u2019s Bedford Avenue corridor, among the borough\u2019s priciest retail areas, experienced a dip in ground-floor asking rents, falling 18% from $359 a square foot to $295 a square foot, the report said. Retailers have taken a wait-and-see approach after a rush to enter the neighborhood rapidly escalated prices, said GFI President Michael Weiser.The looming 2019 partial shutdown of service on the L train, the neighborhood\u2019s main subway line into Manhattan, has exacerbated the dip, Mr. Weiser said. But development is continuing and condominiums sales are still averaging about $1,400 a square foot, according to the report.Part of the reason behind the significant increases in areas besides Williamsburg is that the borough was starting from significantly lower price levels than the city\u2019s developed shopping districts, Mr. Weiser said. Despite being a dense metropolis, the borough was \u201cunder-retailed from a national perspective\u201d for many years, he said. But that is changing.Greenpoint, where condos are selling on average for more than $1,200 a square foot, is expecting to add 10,000 new apartments before the end of 2019, the report said. In downtown Brooklyn, about 5,000 apartments are expected to be built by 2022, the report said.

Roger Federer,        Novak Djokovic, Rafa Nadal and Andy Murray, the top four seeds here, all cruised through the first three rounds of Wimbledon to raise the prospect of the first all-Big Four semifinals since 2012.For fans in southwest London, however, the success of their favorite players\u2014and the promise of future heavyweight clashes\u2014has come at a price. It turned the first week of Wimbledon into a total snooze.Djokovic, Federer, Nadal and Murray have only dropped one set between them in a combined 12 matches. Only Murray has spent longer than six hours on court\u2014in total. And in one afternoon this week, Djokovic and Federer played on Centre Court for just 82 minutes after their respective opponents retired with injury.This, for instance, is what has passed for intrigue in the men\u2019s tournament: Federer had the sniffles this week. That made people vaguely curious, but he said on Saturday that he was feeling at least 50% better than he did on Friday.\u201cI almost had more trouble with my cold than with my opponents,\u201d Federer added in French.Federer\u2019s on-court efficiency so far has been daily vindication of his decision to skip the clay-court season to focus on grass following his success at the Australian Open. At 35, he has played less tennis in the past year than any other member of the Big Four\u2014and that\u2019s by design. \u201cI feel probably I\u2019m fitter by now,\u201d he said.Nadal, meanwhile, has contributed to Wimbledon\u2019s borderline boring first week by looking healthier than he has in years and carrying over the form he used to win his 10th Roland-Garros title in Paris. And Djokovic appears to have shaken whatever funk held him back at the first two Slams of the season in Melbourne and Paris. He hadn\u2019t been shut out of both finals in the same year since 2010.\u201cI\u2019ve been feeling better on the court, as I said, in the last couple of months,\u201d Djokovic said. \u201cBut especially on the grass court this season so far, every match that I\u2019ve played, I felt very comfortable.\u201dOnly Murray has given the home supporters slight cause for concern and threatened to become upset-fodder. The hip injury that bothered him in the buildup to Wimbledon seemed to limit his movement in his victory over Fabio Fognini on Friday evening, though Murray couldn\u2019t say for sure.\u201cBut I won and I got through it,\u201d he said. \u201cNow I\u2019ve got two days to work on some things, rest up a little bit, and get used to the conditions that we\u2019re playing in just now. The courts definitely have gotten a lot quicker than at the beginning of the event.\u201dOn the women\u2019s side,       Serena Williams      \u2019 absence has opened up the field, but it hasn\u2019t sparked the kind of chaos it caused at Roland Garros last month. Williams\u2019 37-year-old sister, Venus, became the oldest woman to reach the second week of Wimbledon since Martina Navratilova here in 1994. And the cream of the women\u2019s game remains very much in control. Ten of the top 16 seeds are in the fourth round of Wimbledon for the first time in a decade, according to the WTA.Top of the pile is 2016 runner-up Angelique Kerber who faces the big-hitting Garbine Muguruza in a highlight of what Wimbledon has dubbed Manic Monday, when all the men and women still in the tournament are scheduled to play.Kerber wobbled in the third round and fought back from a set and a break down on Saturday. Muguruza, the 2015 runner-up here, has had an easier time, breezing through the first three rounds in barely 3 hours 31 minutes. Yet she still doesn\u2019t feel particularly comfortable on grass.\u201cYou know, every time I start the grass season, I\u2019m like, \u2018How the hell I did that final?\u2019\u201d she said.Write to Joshua Robinson at joshua.robinson@wsj.comAppeared in the July 10, 2017, print edition as 'The Big Four Find Groove at Wimbledon.'", "news_time": "2017-07-09 13:32:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/tennis-big-four-find-groove-at-wimbledon-1499607456", "news_title": "Tennis\u2019 Big Four Find Groove at Wimbledon", "keywords": "andy murray,novak djokovic,rafael nadal,roger federer,tennis,wimbledon ,Roger Federer,sports,recreation,routine general news"}, {"content": "The superhero who kicked off Hollywood\u2019s modern comic book craze has swung back into the top tier.\u201cSpider-Man: Homecoming\u201d opened to a strong $117 million in the U.S. and Canada, according to studio estimates\u2014the best opening for a film featuring the web-slinging teenager in a decade.Overseas, it took in $140 million from 56 markets, more than any prior \u201cSpider-Man\u201d film in the same set of countries.

That original run of films reached its apex with 2007\u2019s \u201cSpider-Man 3,\u201d which opened to $151 million domestically and grossed $891 million world-wide.To try to restore the character to his former glory, Sony joined with Marvel, which is behind many of the most successful superhero movies in recent years including \u201cAvengers,\u201d \u201cCaptain America: Civil War\u201d and \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2.\u201dMarvel produced the movie for Sony and integrated Spider-Man with its superhero universe.The new version of the character, played by British actor Tom Holland, first appeared in last year\u2019s blockbuster \u201cCivil War.\u201d\u201cHomecoming\u201d featured Robert Downey Jr.\u2019s \u201cIron Man\u201d as a supporting character.Marvel provided its producing services for free, save for a small compensation if the film grosses more than $750 million globally, as looks likely. But Disney could still benefit greatly from \u201cHomecoming\u2019s\u201d success as it owns all merchandise rights to Spider-Man. More successful movies typically spur more toy sales.To sell \u201cHomecoming\u201d to audiences, Sony\u2019s advertisements emphasized the new Spider-Man\u2019s youth and playful attitude, in comparison to the more serious tone of the \u201cAmazing Spider-Man\u201d films, as well as his partnership with Iron Man.Spider-Man will next appear in a pair of \u201cAvengers\u201d sequels from Marvel and the two studios are working on a follow-up to \u201cHomecoming\u201d scheduled for 2019.July has brought good news to Sony.

But sales and profits fell two years in a row, and directors grew more concerned when Mr. Cumenal presented a three-year strategic plan in the fall of 2016 that didn\u2019t forecast much improvement, according to people familiar with the situation. Tiffany said it wanted a leader who could deliver results faster.To make matters worse, the Friday before the Super Bowl, activist investor Jana Partners LLC alerted the company it had built up a 4.9% stake and wanted a meeting, according to the people.At the root of the jeweler\u2019s tepid results is a stubborn perception: Tiffany has lost its cool and is struggling to get it back. \u201cAudrey Hepburn versus Lady Gaga is a fine line to walk,\u201d said Citi analyst       Paul Lejuez.Mr. Cumenal\u2019s goal was to shift that image, but his job was made harder by a surprising statistic\u201445% of Tiffany\u2019s sales last year came from jewelry categories with an average price of $530 or less. Analysts say that could hurt its aura of exclusivity.\u201cYou\u2019d be hard pressed to find anything at Cartier for $500,\u201d said       Robert Passikoff,        president of market research firm Brand Keys.Chairman       Michael Kowalski,        a 34-year Tiffany veteran serving as interim chief, defended the company\u2019s wide range of prices and styles. \u201cWe built a very large tent,\u201d he said. \u201cThat has been a great strength of the company, and also a great challenge.\u201dManaging that challenge will fall to its next CEO, who is expected to be appointed soon, according to a person familiar with the situation.Mr. Kowalski said Tiffany has struck the right balance between its high and low-end offerings and has elevated its entry-level categories in recent years by adding more gold items and raising prices. He said Tiffany\u2019s proprietary research showed it continues to be a \u201crespected and highly desired brand.\u201dHelena Cawley, a 38-year-old Manhattan entrepreneur, said she wore Tiffany jewelry in her teens and 20s, but now prefers pieces from Cartier or David Yurman, which she says are more sophisticated. \u201cTiffany lost a bit of its cachet,\u201d Ms. Cawley said. \u201cTheir styles haven\u2019t changed very much over the years.\u201dMr. Cumenal was working to update that image. He hired       Grace Coddington,        Vogue magazine\u2019s creative director at large, to conceive a new advertising campaign featuring celebrities, including teenage actress       Elle Fanning.       He also picked Lady Gaga to star in Tiffany\u2019s first Super Bowl ad.In the past, Tiffany\u2019s marketing spotlighted a piece of jewelry along with an anonymous couple caught in a romantic interlude. The new campaigns feature so-called style influencers.\u201cThe recipe for marketing on social media, particularly to millennials, is to have an endorser who people believe in,\u201d said       Simeon Siegel,        an analyst at the brokerage firm Nomura Instinet.Mr. Cumenal, 57 years old, widened Tiffany\u2019s reach beyond its 310 retail stores by making some designs available at edgy boutique Dover Street Market and at Net-a-Porter, a fashion website.He upped the hip factor with a deal to sponsor the Whitney Museum of American Art\u2019s Biennial exhibitions. \u201cAll the cool kids\u201d were at the opening party in March, according to a Vogue article, which noted that \u201crevelers sipped Mo\u00ebt & Chandon through paper straws with a Tiffany-blue swirl.\u201dThe former CEO, in an interview, said he is pleased the board is continuing to pursue strategies he laid out.But new designs represented less than 10% of jewelry sales last year, according to Mr. Kowalski. And two or more years can elapse between the launch of collections.\u201cThey are still selling product lines that were introduced in the 1960s,\u201d said Credit Suisse analyst       Christian Buss.       \u201cGiven that consumer purchases are driven by newness, updating legacy styles hasn\u2019t been adequate to drive demand.\u201dThe company\u2019s HardWear line, which made its debut this spring with the Lady Gaga ad, was its first new collection since Tiffany T was introduced in 2014.Tiffany is playing catch-up in watches, which accounted for 1% of sales in the past two years, the company said. Other luxury brands can get as much as half their revenue from the category, according to       Brian Tunic,        an analyst with RBC Capital Markets. Tiffany launched a new watch line in 2015, after a failed partnership with Swatch ended in a lawsuit. In 2014, Tiffany paid Swatch $480 million in damages, but it has appealed the ruling.Tiffany said it plans to launch a new home and accessories collection this fall that will include leather goods, flatware and silver objects designed by Reed Krakoff, the former creative director of Coach, who was hired earlier this year as Tiffany\u2019s chief artistic officer.Mr. Kowalski, who groomed Mr. Cumenal to replace him after 16 years as CEO, said in an interview at the company\u2019s New York headquarters that some of the legacy styles, including collections by Jean Schlumberger and       Elsa Peretti,        continue to be best sellers. Ms. Peretti\u2019s designs accounted for 9% of Tiffany\u2019s sales last year, according to the company.Mr. Cumenal tried to speed up the development of new lines by creating a research center near Tiffany\u2019s headquarters that will open later this year. The center is expected to shorten product cycles by having the design and production departments work together more closely from the outset. In the past, designers would first sketch their ideas and then pass them to the production team.Charles Lewis Tiffany and a partner opened their first store in 1837 to sell parasols, scent bottles and other items imported from Europe and the Far East. By 1850, when Mr. Tiffany opened a branch in Paris, the company was selling the gemstones of European aristocrats to America\u2019s newly minted millionaires.The brand entered the national zeitgeist with the 1958 publication of Truman Capote\u2019s novella, \u201cBreakfast at Tiffany\u2019s,\u201d and the subsequent movie starring Audrey Hepburn, in which she declares of the company\u2019s Fifth Avenue store, \u201cNothing very bad could happen to you there.\u201dMr. Cumenal joined Tiffany in 2011 from             LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE,       where he ran its wine and spirits business. He found initial success overseeing Tiffany\u2019s international operations, where sales rose about 20% during his tenure.As CEO, Mr. Cumenal ruffled feathers by recruiting outsiders, including a former Cartier executive to head international operations and a former Saks Fifth Avenue executive to oversee the Americas, as well as Mr. Krakoff in the artistic post, according to people familiar with the situation.He introduced a more formal structure to what had been, according to Mr. Kowalski, a \u201cprocess light\u201d company. Some senior executives balked at his requirement that they spend one week a month in New York to attend meetings, arguing they would be more effective in the field, visiting stores or working with their teams, the people said.Other changes annoyed the rank and file, including a new hierarchical atmosphere that was a shift from the open-door, collegial tone fostered by the popular Mr. Kowalski, the people said.Especially irksome was Mr. Cumenal\u2019s decision to dial back the use of Tiffany\u2019s signature blue, which he felt had become over used. Some Asian stores were using blue plate glass, and the company\u2019s print ads often consisted of an entire glossy magazine page printed in the robin\u2019s egg hue. Some believed the move indicated the new CEO lacked respect for Tiffany\u2019s heritage, the people said.Mr. Kowalski, in the interview, said the use of the color was an issue the company wrestled with over the years. \u201cThere was legitimate concern over the wise use of such an important brand asset,\u201d he said.Some board members were put off by Mr. Cumenal\u2019s management style, which they described as disdainful and aloof, other people familiar with the matter said.Directors were perturbed when Mr. Cumenal didn\u2019t tell them he decided to name Mr. Krakoff, who had been working for the company as a consultant, to the chief artistic post until January, after the contract was signed, the people said.Mr. Kowalski said he tried to help Mr. Cumenal navigate board relationships, but acknowledged there \u201cwas a natural ebb and flow of tensions around that.\u201dAnother point of contention was a push by Mr. Cumenal to add younger board members who had more fashion, digital and global experience, the people said.The board, which included four directors age 70 or older, agreed it needed a refresh and had instructed an executive search firm last year to help it identify new candidates, one of the people said.But it wanted to move at a more gradual pace, given that much of Tiffany\u2019s senior management had turned over during the previous three years. The board had already raised the retirement age to 74 from 72 in 2014, and there was talk of raising it again, to 75, the people said.In February, after Mr. Cumenal\u2019s ouster, Tiffany reached an agreement with Jana Partners, the activist investor, to add three new directors, including a former CEO of luxury jeweler Bulgari and a co-CEO of fashion house Tory Burch LLC.Tiffany also agreed to limit waivers for directors who exceeded its retirement age. One director didn\u2019t stand for re-election at the company\u2019s annual meeting in May, and Tiffany said two directors won\u2019t stand for re-election next year.Mr. Kowalski said the board is attuned to the changes in luxury retailing, where opening new stores is no longer a recipe for success. \u201cIt recognizes that the growth strategies that proved successful a decade ago are not likely to drive financial success today,\u201d he said.Tiffany\u2019s shares, which had sunk below $60 in June 2016, are now trading above $90. They are up nearly 17% since the company announced the CEO change on Feb. 5.Jana Partners is pushing Tiffany to expand more overseas, particularly in the Middle East, and for growth in e-commerce, which accounts for about 6% of Tiffany\u2019s sales.Some analysts and investors also say Tiffany should streamline its supply chain. The jeweler is rare in the business for owning processing and polishing operations. It also has agreements with diamond producers to purchase a minimum number of stones each year. The company said its rationale is to secure enough high quality supply to satisfy its production requirements.Mr. Siegel, the Nomura Instinet analyst, said the strategy ties up working capital and creates a backlog of inventory. According to his estimates, inventory totaled 54% of sales in the most recent fiscal year, up from 39% in 2000. He said locking up supply wasn\u2019t as important now that monopolies no longer control the diamond trade and that prices, according to Rapaport-RapNet Diamond Trading Network, have declined from their 2011 peak.Mr. Kowalski said the strategy is less costly and results in better quality products. He added Tiffany is working to manage its inventory more efficiently by editing down its offerings and by using new software to better predict demand.\u2014David Benoit contributed to this article.Appeared in the July 10, 2017, print edition as 'Tiffany Hunts To Regain its \u2018Cool\u2019.'", "news_time": "2017-07-09 13:27:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/tiffany-hunts-for-path-to-regain-cool-1499621248", "news_title": "Tiffany & Co., the Luxury Brand With a Midlife Crisis", "keywords": " fifth avenue,jewelry, luxury goods, retail sales,Tiffany,TIF,Michael Kowalski,Frederic Cumenal,financial performance,earnings,sales figures,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,celebrities,living,lifestyle,non-metallic mineral mining,quarrying,retail,wholesale,specialty stores,jewelry stores,trusts,funds,financial vehicles,closed-end funds,investment trusts,basic materials,resources,consumer goods,financial services,gemstone mining,investing,securities,luxury goods,mining"}, {"content": "Cosco Shipping Holdings Co.      , China\u2019s biggest shipping company, agreed to buy smaller rival         Orient Overseas (International) Ltd.       for $6.3 billion, establishing an Asian container giant at the same time that the industry struggles to emerge from a multiyear down cycle.The move would see a half dozen supercarriers, grouped into three alliances, move about three-quarters of all seaborne trade after a wave of consolidation among the world\u2019s top 20 carriers over the past year.The Chinese conglomerate joined         Shanghai International Port (Group) Co.      , one of the world\u2019s biggest port operators, to buy a combined 68.7% stake from Orient Overseas\u2019s controlling shareholder, the companies said Sunday in a joint statement.The offer price of 78.67 Hong Kong dollars (US$10.07) per share is a 31% premium over Orient Overseas\u2019s Friday closing price. The deal will have to be approved by global regulators, which is expected in the next six to eight months.The Wall Street Journal reported the deal on Saturday.Orient Overseas is controlled by the family of former Hong Kong Chief Executive Tung Chee-Hwa. The two sides had been in talks for months but were stuck over the price.\u201cThe Tungs did not want to sell,\u201d said a person involved in the deal. \u201cBut there was a lot of political pressure from Beijing to make it happen and at the end they gave in with a fair price at hand.\u201dCosco hasn\u2019t hidden its ambition to become one of the world\u2019s dominant carriers. The deal would make it the third-biggest container operator in terms of capacity, behind Denmark\u2019s Maersk Line and Switzerland-based Mediterranean Shipping Co. It would also create the second-biggest mover of U.S. imports, with a 10.8% market share, and the third-largest in terms of exports, with an 8.5% share, according to the Journal of Commerce.\u201cWith the acquisition, Cosco effectively doubles its share in the U.S. market, which puts it at par with the other big players,\u201d said       Basil Karatzas,        chief executive of New York-based Karatzas Marine Advisors & Co. \u201cIt took Maersk decades to develop this market, but with the Orient Overseas deal, Cosco did it overnight.\u201dContainer ships move 98% of the world\u2019s manufactured goods. The industry was shaken last year when South Korea\u2019s top shipping company, Hanjin Shipping Co., went bankrupt, sparking a wave of consolidation among the top 20 players.Over the past 16 months, Maersk bought Germany\u2019s Hamburg S\u00fcd for $4 billion, Japan\u2019s three-biggest operators merged their container businesses and French giant CMA CGM, which would now lose its third-place ranking to Cosco, bought Singapore\u2019s Neptune Orient Lines for $2.5 billion.After Cosco\u2019s move, the top six operators would move about 70% of global container capacity and 69% of all U.S. exports and imports, according to Copenhagen-based SeaIntelligence Consulting.Cosco said it offered to buy the remaining shares from Orient Overseas\u2019 minority shareholders at the same offer price, though it plans to keep Orient Overseas\u2019s listing status and branding after the deal.Shanghai International Port will own a 9.9% stake.Upon completion of the deal, Cosco Shipping and Orient Overseas Container Lines, OOIL\u2019s shipping unit, would have more than 400 ships and a capacity exceeding 2.9 million containers.Orient Overseas Container Lines also has ports in Taiwan and Long Beach, Calif.

Mr. McClure has resigned from Mountain View, Calif.-based incubator firm after acknowledging he had made sexual advances toward multiple women in work-related settings.\u201cThe future of the 500 Melbourne program is dependent on the delivery of a remedial plan that not only addresses sexual harassment in the startup ecosystem but also promotes women and other underrepresented groups,\u201d LaunchVic said in a statement.Mr. McClure had joined LaunchVic in promoting their program in May, all while his misconduct was being investigated, unbeknownst to his Australian partners.Just days after announcing Mr. McClure\u2019s demotion, 500 Startups co-founder and new Chief Executive       Christine Tsai       wrote a blog post in which she apologized to the Australian startup ecosystem about the firm\u2019s handling of the matter.

In his second foreign trip, President       Donald Trump       largely held firm to the nationalist principles that were central to his campaign identity, suggesting that the America First doctrine that underpins his foreign policy is more durable than some of his European counterparts had hoped.German Chancellor       Angela Merkel,        speaking Saturday at the close of the summit, said the ideological gulf has proved tough to bridge. Talking about the back-and-forth with the Trump administration over the summit\u2019s joint statement, the German chancellor said: \u201cThe negotiations on the climate issue reflected dissent\u2014everyone against the United States of America. And that the negotiations on the trade issue were especially tough was also a result of the United States taking certain positions.\u201dStill bristling over Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw from the Paris climate accord, one French official said that an aim in drafting the joint statement was to ensure that the U.S. \u201cis clearly identified as being alone.\u201dIf anything, Mr. Trump\u2019s two forays overseas have shown that some leaders are bending toward his positions, not the reverse.Capital Journal is WSJ.com\u2019s home for politics, policy and national security news.The statement, for example, carried language about America helping other countries use \u201cfossil fuels more cleanly and efficiently.\u201d A European Union official conceded the reference to \u201cthese kind of energy sources is not something we like.\u201dBut the White House liked it. Trump officials cast the wording as a victory for a president who still sees a place for oil and gas drilling.\u201cWe got language in there that is consistent with the speech the president gave when he announced the decision to withdraw from the Paris accord,\u201d one senior White House official said Saturday.So it went with trade.Mr. Trump has long complained that past trade deals favored other nations at the expense of the U.S., resulting in large trade deficits. The final statement bore a distinctly Trumpian ring, stressing the importance of \u201creciprocal and mutually advantageous trade.\u201dThe White House was happy with it. When the subject of trade came up a few months ago at a meeting of finance officials from the 20 leading countries, \u201cit was kind of 19-1\u2014me being the one,\u201d Treasury Secretary       Steven Mnuchin       recalled.Far from showing that his views have shifted, Mr. Trump used the three-day trip to deliver the clearest vision he\u2019s offered to date of his world view: a commitment to preserving western civilization. He held up the West as the standard all should reach.The location he chose for that message was Poland, home to a socially conservative government that has at times antagonized European partners.\u201cThe fundamental question of our time is whether the West has the will to survive,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cDo we have the confidence in our values to defend them at any cost? Do we have enough respect for our citizens to protect our borders?\u201dAs he did in Belgium in his first foreign trip in May, Mr. Trump called on NATO countries to pay their share of maintaining the alliance.Thousands of Poles cheered him: \u201cDonald Trump! Donald Trump!\u201dIt made an impression. \u201cPoland was so terrific to me,\u201d he said at an event Saturday showcasing a women\u2019s entrepreneurial fund that was his daughter Ivanka\u2019s brainchild.Mr. Trump did give a long-sought endorsement of NATO mutual defense measures in his Poland speech, but he also showed in his meeting with       Vladimir Putin       that he is intent on finding ways to work with Russia, as he has vowed to do since early in his campaign.If Europe is wary of Mr. Trump, his core voters are likely to be reassured, analysts said. The Donald Trump speaking at Warsaw\u2019s Krasinski Square was the one they remember from red-state rallies.\u201cHe wants to show at least his domestic base that he\u2019s true to all of the principles that he enunciated during the election campaign,\u201d said Angela Stent, a government professor at Georgetown University.Still, European leaders aren\u2019t giving up on the idea that they can bring Mr. Trump around to their views.One diplomat at the summit said Mr. Trump is something of a \u201cwork in progress\u201d and that officials need to exercise patience in dealing with him.As president, Mr. Trump is getting more of a firsthand look at how his internationalist counterparts actually work.The women\u2019s fund championed by his daughter might be one example. It is run by the World Bank, a symbol of the sort of multilateral institution Mr. Trump has at times scorned. Different countries are ponying up millions of dollars to get the fund up and running\u2014to Ivanka Trump\u2019s delight.Mr. Trump heaped praise on World Bank President       Jim Yong Kim       at an event formally rolling out the fund on Saturday.He also showed he\u2019s willing to challenge Mr. Putin, who has been a pariah among many European leaders partly because of Russia\u2019s 2014 intervention in Ukraine and support for Syrian leader       Bashar al-Assad.In their two-hour meeting Friday, Mr. Trump told Mr. Putin that Americans aren\u2019t happy about Russian interference in the 2016 campaign. \u201cI strongly pressed President Putin twice about Russian meddling in our election. He vehemently denied it. I\u2019ve already given my opinion.....,\u201d Mr. Trump tweeted Sunday morning. \u201cWe negotiated a ceasefire in parts of Syria which will save lives. Now it is time to move forward in working constructively with Russia!\u201dEarlier in the week, Mr. Trump equivocated on whether Russia was solely responsible for election meddling. Other countries could have done it, too, he said, though he didn\u2019t specify which ones.In an account Mr. Putin gave Saturday, Mr. Trump pressed him on the issue repeatedly. \u201cHe allocated a great deal of attention to this,\u201d the Russian president said.Mr. Trump\u2019s third foreign trip comes later this week, when he travels to Paris to mark Bastille Day.That visit could also test Mr. Trump\u2019s principles, as he meets French officials wary of him moving in a protectionist direction.\u201cWe have sent a message to Americans that if there are unilateral measures from the U.S. we will react and react very quickly,\u201d one French official said.\u2014Emre Peker, William Horobin, and Anton Troianovski contributed to this article.Write to Peter Nicholas at peter.nicholas@wsj.comAppeared in the July 10, 2017, print edition as 'Trump Sticks To Positions At Summit.'", "news_time": "2017-07-09 12:13:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trumps-america-first-policy-proves-to-be-an-immovable-object-at-g-20-1499616791", "news_title": "Trump\u2019s \u2018America First\u2019 Policy Proves to Be an Immovable Object at G-20", "keywords": "donald trump,g-20,group of 20,president trump,trump g-20 ,Donald Trump,Jim Yong Kim,Angela Merkel,Bashar al-Assad,Steven Mnuchin,Vladimir Putin,political,general news,international relations,politics,domestic politics,government bodies,executive branch"}, {"content": "Ivanka Trump makes a good case for a federal family-leave policy (\u201cPaid Family Leave Is a Good National Policy,\u201d Letters, July 5). However, she leaves out the negatives of this proposal. We already have failing programs like Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, disability and others that are bankrupting our country and are full of waste and fraud. I am sure the CBO would score this type of proposal well, as progressives like this, and most certainly the benefits would be touted to save billions. But like every federal program, legislators will continue to add to the benefits and not fund the program correctly. Has the CBO ever been right beyond one year? Let\u2019s fix the programs we have before we add more burdens to taxpayers.Ken NelsonChicagoPaid family leave is another reason jobs will leave this country. Employers will pay twice: first for the worker away on leave, then for his or her replacement. As most jobs today are knowledge based, it takes lots of training (time and money) to ramp up a supplemental worker. Will employers get time to do this? Will they be able to pass along this cost to whomever they serve? Why should this burden fall to an employer?It isn\u2019t just wages that drive jobs overseas, it\u2019s the whole package of regulations, required benefits, burdensome reporting and government intrusion that causes employers to move jobs. This is another terrible idea for the competitiveness of America, and it will be lower-wage workers who will suffer most.We are so far away from a world that once hired me to solve my employer\u2019s problems. Now it\u2019s a world where my employer exists to solve my problems. And you wonder why American jobs leave for overseas?Michael Le MonierScottsdale, Ariz.The proposal contained in President Trump\u2019s budget does not call for paid family leave, despite your editorial board and Ms. Trump using the term.Paid family leave allows anyone time to care for a close family member, including an elderly parent or a sick spouse. The Bureau of Labor Statistics has made this clear.Three U.S. states already have it: California, New Jersey and Rhode Island. New York will began a program in January. These programs also allow workers to use the leave to care for themselves in recovering from illness.In the states, paid family leave operates as a self-sustaining insurance program. A tiny payroll deduction creates a large enough fund to provide workers with some paid leave when needed. The results are phenomenal, not just for families but for businesses as well.An extensive examination in California found that the program has had a positive or at least neutral effect on profitability for 91% of companies, turnover for 93% and morale for 99%. More people are staying in the workforce, creating more goods and services. A researcher found similar positive results in New Jersey. Also, with paid family leave, fewer people are dependent on public assistance.The solution is to take this insurance program and make it national. The proposal in President Trump\u2019s budget, however, is for parental leave only.Josh LevsAtlantaI read Ivanka Trump\u2019s well-reasoned letter in support of paid family leave. Unfortunately, all government-supported or mandated benefits are initiated as a \u201ctargeted benefit to help the people who need it the most\u201d and \u201cwith a reasonable time limit and benefit cap.\u201d Then these benefits are inevitably expanded beyond reason with little concern about cost.Kevin FletcherGolden, Colo.No matter how great mandated paid family leave may be, it clearly doesn\u2019t fit the enumerated powers under the Constitution.

The physicians,       Joseph Herman       of the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and       Markus B\u00fcchler       of the University of Heidelberg, met Mr. Liu and his Chinese medical team over the weekend at a hospital in the northeastern city of Shenyang.The foreign doctors said in a statement Sunday that \u201cboth physicians believe Mr. Liu can be safely transported with appropriate medical evacuation care and support.\u201d The evacuation, their statement said, \u201cwould have to take place as quickly as possible.\u201dThe First Hospital of Chinese Medical University, where Mr. Liu is being treated, said Saturday that it was \u201cunsafe\u201d for him to travel. In recent days, the hospital said, Mr. Liu had accumulated a large amount of fluid in his abdomen and was having difficulty eating.The foreign physicians\u2019 statement\u2014which was emailed to reporters and posted on both their universities\u2019 websites\u2014marks a surprise break in Chinese authorities\u2019 tight control over information about Mr. Liu.China\u2019s most prominent political prisoner, Mr. Liu has been in custody since late 2008 for authoring and organizing a signature drive for a manifesto calling for peaceful political change. Rigorous government censorship has kept his name out of the media and off the internet in China ever since, and his wife has lived under house arrest since he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010.Mr. Liu was diagnosed with late-stage liver cancer in May and granted medical parole in early June, though news of his illness wasn\u2019t confirmed by the government until June 26. Hospital authorities have released little information about Mr. Liu and kept him under police guard on an isolated floor, requiring doctors to hand over their smartphones to prevent unauthorized photos, according to a family friend who said he spoke with a member of the Chinese medical team.Beijing extended invitations to Dr. Herman, an oncologist, and Dr. B\u00fcchler, a surgeon, to come to China as it faced mounting pressure from the U.S. and European Union to let Mr. Liu seek treatment abroad. On Friday, the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights also demanded access to the political activist, according to a spokeswoman.China\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment. A woman answering the phone Sunday evening at the First Hospital said no one was available to comment. A statement posted to the hospital\u2019s website Saturday quoted the foreign physicians as saying they couldn\u2019t do more for Mr. Liu than the Chinese team had.\u2018If Beijing refuses to allow them to go wherever they wish to seek treatment, all it will have done is ratcheted up its own culpability in the torment of a Nobel Peace Prize winner who never should have spent a day in jail\u2019In their statement, Drs. Herman and B\u00fcchler acknowledged \u201cthe quality of care\u201d provided to Mr. Liu so far. They recommended he receive palliative care and said \u201cinterventional procedures\u201d and other options might be possible.Both the University of Heidelberg and MD Anderson \u201care prepared to offer Mr. Liu the best care possible,\u201d they said.The invitation presents Beijing with a dilemma. The Chinese leadership has sought to deny Mr. Liu any public platform for his views. Refusing to let him go risks making Beijing only the second government to have a Nobel Peace laureate die in custody after Nazi Germany, which saw journalist and Hitler-critic       Carl von Ossietzky       succumb to tuberculosis in a prison hospital in 1938.\u201cIf Beijing refuses to allow them to go wherever they wish to seek treatment, all it will have done is ratcheted up its own culpability in the torment of a Nobel Peace Prize winner who never should have spent a day in jail,\u201d said Sophie Richardson, China director for Human Rights Watch.It is difficult to say how the Chinese government will react, said one Western diplomat, who expressed skepticism Mr. Liu would be allowed to leave. \u201cAt this point, it would be a huge climbdown\u201d for China, the diplomat said.Write to Josh Chin at josh.chin@wsj.comAppeared in the July 10, 2017, print edition as 'Foreign Doctors Say China\u2019s Liu Can Travel.'", "news_time": "2017-07-09 09:42:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinese-dissident-liu-xiaobo-can-travel-for-treatment-say-foreign-doctors-1499607765", "news_title": "Chinese Dissident Liu Xiaobo Can Travel for Treatment, Say Foreign Doctors", "keywords": "cancer,dissident,human rights,jail,nobel laureates,nobel peace prize,parole,prison,unhcr,united nations,University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center,Liu Xiaobo,awards,political,general news,health,liver cancer,medical conditions,medical treatments,procedures"}, {"content": "Co-working provider Serendipity Labs Inc. has looked for quick expansion in the U.S. using franchise agreements and joint-venture deals. Now, a new agreement extends its reach to China.Serendipity Labs has joined forces with UrWork Venture Investment Co., a Beijing startup with a $1.3 billion valuation, to create a 34,000-square-foot location at 28 Liberty St.Expected to open in October, the new space gives UrWork, a rival to co-working giant WeWork Cos. in China, its first foothold in the U.S.The deal allows both companies to broaden the network of locations available to their customers in China and the U.S. without the extensive investments and time involved in trying to expand internationally on their own.\u201cWe were not going to move people and capital into China to try to make that network,\u201d said John Arenas, Serendipity Labs\u2019s chief executive. \u201cBut because we have a full-service customer base that is growing, they want to understand how we can serve their needs globally.\u201dThe move represents a departure from the traditional co-working business model. Expanding is expensive and can come with a lot of risks, industry executives said.Firms have to secure long-term leases, build out the appealing interiors that often have pricey finishes and furnishings, and manage the networking events often associated with co-working memberships. Until now the few co-working providers that have rapidly grown have done so by raising large amounts of capital from investors.\u201cThat is quite restrictive in terms of who can get a hold of that capital,\u201d said Ben Munn, managing director of solution development and consulting for the Instant Group, a company that finds and manages office arrangements for companies. \u201cSo you do see more companies now going for a variety of routes, which include joint ventures and interesting deals with landlords with much lower liability.\u201dBoth UrWork and Serendipity Labs, which bills itself as an upscale co-working provider, have plans to expand their network of locations.UrWork, which has raised more than $184 million from investors in several rounds of funding, said it has more than 78 locations in 20 cities in China and Singapore, and intends to boost the number of its facilities to 150 in 35 cities during the next three years. In the U.S., UrWork also said it is planning to open a Los Angeles location later this year.While UrWork has built its business in China providing space and professional services to small businesses and startups, the company said it is seeing demand from bigger companies. It recently announced the addition of Chinese video-sharing firm Bilibili as a tenant in Shanghai and             Amazon.com Inc.       in Shenzhen.The New York location, which is in the former One Chase Manhattan Plaza tower owned by Chinese conglomerate             Fosun International Ltd.      , is expected to attract, in part, Chinese companies that have business in New York and other multinational firms with ties to China, said UrWork Chief Executive and founder Mao Daqing. UrWork is an investor in the New York location.Some of the staff will be able to speak Mandarin. UrWork and Serendipity Labs said they would connect their reservation systems so members of both companies will be able to easily book space throughout the combined network of locations via apps.\u201cWe think Serendipity Labs will ensure our members who are coming to New York of the highest level of co-working experience,\u201d Mr. Mao said.About half of Serendipity Labs\u2019 clients are established companies, making it important to provide flexible office options in other cities and secondary office markets, Mr. Arenas said. Serendipity, which has six sites and plans to add 10 by the end of the year, has more than 100 locations committed to development.Among Serendipity Labs\u2019s less conventional co-working deals are franchise agreements with hotel operators to set up locations in office buildings as well as partnerships with entrepreneurial landlords.At its Stamford, Conn., location, the company is a minority partner in the franchise business with its landlord, Gottesman Real Estate Partners. In Nashville, hotel developer and manager Maximum Hospitality is applying its expertise from running hotels under brands such as Marriott, Starwood and Hilton to building its Serendipity Labs co-working franchise in Nashville.Maximum will open one Nashville location later this year and anticipates two more there in the next 12 to 18 months.\u201cThere are a number of companies moving there each week and month,\u201d said Maximum Chief Executive Dan McEwan. \u201cThis allows us to grab those companies and give them their first address at our locations.\u201dWrite to Keiko Morris at Keiko.Morris@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-09 09:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/weworks-chinese-rival-moves-into-manhattan-office-market-1499605204", "news_title": "WeWork\u2019s Chinese Rival Moves Into Manhattan Office Market", "keywords": "UrWork Venture Investment,capacity,facilities,corporate,industrial news,facility openings,political,general news,real estate,property,real estate transactions,office real estate,commercial,industrial real estate,construction"}, {"content": "Artificial-intelligence engineers have a problem: They often don\u2019t know what their creations are thinking.As artificial intelligence grows in complexity and prevalence, it also grows more powerful. AI already has factored into decisions about who goes to jail and who receives a loan. There are suggestions AI should determine who gets the best chance to live when a self-driving car faces an unavoidable crash.Defining AI is slippery and growing more so, as startups slather the buzzword over whatever they are doing. It is generally accepted as any attempt to ape human intelligence and abilities.One subset that has taken off is neural networks, systems that \u201clearn\u201d as humans do through training, turning experience into networks of simulated neurons. The result isn\u2019t code, but an unreadable, tangled mass of millions\u2014in some cases billions\u2014of artificial neurons, which explains why those who create modern AIs can be befuddled as to how they solve tasks.Most researchers agree the challenge of understanding AI is pressing. If we don\u2019t know how an artificial mind works, how can we ascertain its biases or predict its mistakes?We won\u2019t know in advance if an AI is racist, or what unexpected thought patterns it might have that would make it crash an autonomous vehicle. We might not know about an AI\u2019s biases until long after it has made countless decisions. It\u2019s important to know when an AI will fail or behave unexpectedly\u2014when it might tell us, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Dave. I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t do that.\u201d\u201cA big problem is people treat AI or machine learning as being very neutral,\u201d said       Tracy Chou,        a software engineer who worked with machine learning at Pinterest Inc. \u201cAnd a lot of that is people not understanding that it\u2019s humans who design these models and humans who choose the data they are trained on.\u201dAn example can be found on Google Translate. Ask it to translate \u201cdoctor\u201d to Portuguese, and it always returns the male form of the noun, m\u00e9dico, over the female, m\u00e9dica. Type in \u201cnurse\u201d and you get enfermeira (female)\u2014never enfermeiro (male).Conspiracy? No, it is a natural consequence of biases inherent in the bodies of literature used to train translation systems. Something similar happens in data when researchers eliminate the category of race: Other data, such as where a person lives, correlate so strongly with race that they become unintentional proxies for it.Unlike with humans, we can\u2019t just ask a robot why it does what it does. Artificial intelligences can excel at narrow tasks, but even those that talk have introspective powers about on par with a cockroach.It is a difficult enough problem to crack that the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, better known as Darpa, is funding researchers working on \u201cexplainable artificial intelligence.\u201dHere\u2019s why we\u2019re in this pickle: A good way to solve problems in computer science is for engineers to code a neural network\u2014essentially a primitive brain\u2014and train it by feeding it enormous piles of data. Once the AI has had enough time to chew through a bunch of images labeled \u201ccat,\u201d for example, it can reliably pick out pictures of a cat.The tricky bit is that neural networks learn by altering their own innards. This is basically how your brain works, too. And like the connections between the 86 billion or so neurons in your brain, the precise way an AI \u201cthinks\u201d is incomprehensible.Engineers call this the \u201cinterpretability\u201d problem (as in, the lack of it) and refer to neural networks as \u201cblack boxes\u201d\u2014things we can stimulate and observe but whose insides we can\u2019t understand.Researchers at DeepMind Technologies Ltd., a subsidiary of             Alphabet Inc.,       announced a novel way to get inside the minds of machines: treat them like human children.To say engineers are using the techniques of cognitive psychology on AI isn\u2019t an analogy. The team at DeepMind used exactly the same tests and materials psychologists use on children to tease out how their AI thinks, says David Barrett, a DeepMind research scientist who worked on the project.Decades of research on unpacking the human brain through cognitive science may now be applied to machines, potentially unlocking a whole new avenue for understanding AI and making it accountable, he said.A result of DeepMind\u2019s research: We now know at least one of its AIs\u2014a \u201cone-shot learning model\u201d designed to learn words after being exposed to them only once\u2014is, surprisingly, solving problems the same way humans do. Like humans, it is identifying objects by shape, even though it wasn\u2019t taught to, and even though there are other ways to identify random objects, such as color, texture or movement. Previously, how it learned was opaque.Understanding is just the beginning of how we interact with artificial intelligences. The other half of robot psychology is what might be described as therapy\u2014that is, changing an AI\u2019s mind.Because engineers typically create many versions of an AI when trying to discover the best one, the use of cognitive psychology could give engineers more power to choose the ones that \u201cthink\u201d the way we want them to, Mr. Barrett said. Alternatively, we might find it\u2019s better when AIs don\u2019t think like us: We might learn something new about how to solve problems.The upshot is that when we replace human decision-makers with artificial intelligences, AIs have the potential to be better, with fewer mistakes and more accountability, because their output is measurable and we might be able to trace exactly how they make decisions.We ask humans to do this all the time\u2014in a court of law, when dissecting a business decision\u2014but humans are notoriously unreliable narrators. With machines, at last, we could have decision-makers whose every bias and fleeting impulse can be inspected and potentially altered.Write to Christopher Mims at christopher.mims@wsj.comAppeared in the July 10, 2017, print edition as 'Career of the Future: Robot Psychologist Scientists Go Inside Minds of Machines.'", "news_time": "2017-07-09 09:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/career-of-the-future-robot-psychologist-1499605203", "news_title": "Career of the Future: Robot Psychologist ", "keywords": "ai,artificial intelligence,cognition,cognitive psychology,machine learning,robotics,David Barrett,political,general news,sciences,humanities,autonomous driving technologies,automotive,technology"}, {"content": "Leading central banks plan to withdraw some of the stimulus measures they have put in place since the financial crisis. But their timing seems a little puzzling: Inflation, which is already below their targets, is falling world-wide.The decline in inflation is a mystery since the global economy appears to be growing at a faster pace than during recent years, while unemployment rates continue to edge lower.According to central bankers, inflation is generated by the gap between the demand for goods and services and the economy\u2019s ability to supply them. When that output gap is wide, inflation is lower, and when it is narrow, prices grow more quickly. Low inflation is a symptom of a weak economy, something they want to avoid as much as high inflation, a sign of an overheated economy.To boost inflation, central banks stimulate demand by lowering interest rates, encouraging households and businesses to borrow and spend. As the volume of goods and services that people want to buy nears the limit of the economy\u2019s capacity to supply them, wages rise, as do prices, generating inflation.But try as they might, central banks have been unable to reach their inflation targets over recent years, despite their success boosting growth and lowering jobless numbers. That has raised questions about the reliability of the traditional link between the output gap and prices.\u201cCentral banks across the Western world are struggling to define that relationship,\u201d said Bert Colijn, an economist at ING Bank.Across the Group of 20 largest economies, which account for most of the world\u2019s economic activity, annual inflation slumped in May to its lowest level since August 2016, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.Much of that decline was due to easing energy prices. But even excluding that volatile item, and similarly choppy food prices, \u201ccore\u201d inflation is slowing in many places.That isn\u2019t a recent phenomenon. Core inflation in developed economies hasn\u2019t changed much in the years since the financial crisis, never reaching the 2.5% rate it stood at in September 2008, when Lehman Brothers collapsed, or going below the 1.1% rate it hit in December 2010.Central bankers are struggling to explain why inflation isn\u2019t responding the way the textbooks say it should to an improving global economy and falling jobless rates.\u00a0According to the OECD, the unemployment rate in developed economies fell to 5.9% in May from 6.3% a year earlier.In the U.S., Federal Reserve Chairwoman       Janet Yellen       has shrugged off the past few months of low inflation numbers, saying they were caused by temporary domestic factors, such as cheaper new cellphone plans. But the global inflation slowdown calls that thesis into question.Chicago Fed President       Charles Evans      suggested last month that poorly understood technological advances or aging populations could also be holding down inflation around the world.\u201cI sometimes wonder if there isn\u2019t something more global, more technological that\u2019s taking place that we don\u2019t quite have our arms around very well,\u201d\u00a0he said.Fed officials devoted part of their June 13-14 meeting to debating inflation\u2019s surprising weakness.\u00a0Some argued the link between the output gap and inflation had weakened over the past few years. Others worried letting the economy grow too fast would bring about a sudden burst of inflation that would be hard to control.The picture is just as confusing in Europe.In a June 27 speechthat was widely viewed by investors as signaling a readiness to remove some stimulus later this year or early next, European Central Bank President       Mario Draghi       said inflation has been weaker \u201cthan one would expect on the basis of output gap estimates and historical patterns.\u201dMr. Draghi concluded that a narrowing output gap would eventually have its usual effect on prices. It would just take longer.Other global factors may be at play. Because so many companies compete around the world, weaker economic growth and sluggish inflation in one country could keep a lid on prices in other countries, propagating low inflation across continents.Another explanation could be lower inflation expectations around the world. After years of tepid price growth, workers may not push that hard for a raise and companies may not feel compelled to increase prices despite signs of improvement in the economy.Whatever the cause, central bankers appear willing for now to look beyond the past few months of weak inflation numbers as they shift away from easy money policies. Faith in output gap theory is one driver. Some also are growing worried about other problems. For example, recent speeches from Fed officials and the minutes of the last meeting suggest a growing concern about financial stability as asset prices rise.If consumer price trends don\u2019t turn soon, however, central bank officials could find they have undermined the inflation mission they\u2019ve established as their core objective.Write to Paul Hannon at paul.hannon@wsj.com and David Harrison at david.harrison@wsj.comAppeared in the July 10, 2017, print edition as 'Weak Inflation Vexes Central Banks.'", "news_time": "2017-07-09 08:03:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/weak-inflation-raises-questions-about-traditional-model-linking-output-and-prices-1499601604", "news_title": "Central Banks Looking to Reduce Stimulus Face Quandary of Falling Inflation", "keywords": " central banks, consumer price, ecb, european central bank, fed, federal reserve, inflation, janet yellen, mario draghi,outlook,economic performance,indicators,economic growth,inflation,prices,employment,unemployment,economic news,commentaries,opinions"}, {"content": "If fireworks erupt at Wednesday\u2019s confirmation hearing for President       Donald Trump\u2019s       pick to be the next FBI director, they aren\u2019t likely to be sparked by the nominee,       Christopher Wray,        a former Justice Department official known as a workhorse who eschews the spotlight.Many current and former FBI agents say that is exactly what the agency needs\u2014someone who focuses on running investigations while leaving politics to others\u2014as the Federal Bureau of Investigation navigates turbulence following the firing of former Director       James Comey.       Other agents and legal observers wonder if Mr. Wray, who has spent a decade as a defense lawyer, has the gravitas to buck political pressure and chart an independent course for the nation\u2019s premier law-enforcement agency.The public will hear from Mr. Wray on Wednesday for the first time since his selection, as the Senate Judiciary Committee weighs his nomination to lead the FBI and its 13,000 agents. If confirmed, the 50-year-old Mr. Wray would take over one of the most challenging jobs in law enforcement, charged with impartially overseeing investigations while weathering political storms.\u201cChris looks for the way that creates the least drama,\u201d said       John Richter,        an attorney who worked with Mr. Wray at the Justice Department and at his law firm, King & Spalding.Few would say that about Mr. Comey, a larger-than-life figure at 6-foot-8 who was known for his dramatically timed press conferences, his performances before Congress and, by his own account, information leaks to the press. Mr. Comey was beloved by many agents for standing up for them, but he also attracted sometimes-unwelcome attention to the agency.The FBI in recent months has been criticized for its handling of the investigation into former Secretary of State       Hillary Clinton\u2019s       use of a private email server, buffeted by Mr. Comey\u2019s firing, and stung by Mr. Trump\u2019s allegations that its agents are on a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201dDemocrats plan to press Mr. Wray on whether he could stand up to White House pressure if necessary. Mr. Comey told Congress Mr. Trump demanded his loyalty and pressured him to drop an investigation of a former top aide, allegations the White House has denied.Mr. Comey\u2019s dismissal remains a sore point within the Bureau. At a \u201cFamily Day\u201d event last week at FBI headquarters, some agents wore T-shirts reading \u201cComey Is My Homey,\u201d as have others at bureau field offices around the country, according to photos and people at the events.\u201cThey are still ticked off,\u201d said       Frank Montoya Jr.      , a longtime FBI agent and supervisor who retired last year. Mr. Wray is \u201cgoing to be viewed first and foremost as a political appointment by a president who demanded loyalty from the last director and didn\u2019t get it, so he fired him,\u201d Mr. Montoya said.A big test for Mr. Wray would come the next time Mr. Trump tweeted criticism of the FBI, Mr. Montoya said. \u201cIs he going to apologize for the tweet or is he going to speak out forcefully and say that\u2019s not the way it is?\u201d he said.Mr. Wray appears to be reaching out to agents, meeting with the FBI Agents Association at his request, according to the group\u2019s president,       Thomas O\u2019Connor.Mr. O\u2019Connor said he was impressed by Mr. Wray\u2019s understanding of how agents do their job. \u201cIt was a positive meeting,\u201d he said, adding that agents are looking for someone who is \u201cruled by what is the right thing to do.\u201dMr. Wray\u2019s associates said he would walk away from the job if put in a compromising situation. They cited his threat to resign in 2004 along with Mr. Comey, then deputy attorney general, because the two believed a domestic surveillance program up for reauthorization was unconstitutional.\u201cHe\u2019s very good at convincing people of a wiser course, but he\u2019s highly principled, and if he can\u2019t stop the train, he\u2019ll find a way to blow the whistle and get off,\u201d Mr. Richter said.Mr. Wray spent several years near the top of the Justice Department hierarchy in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, routinely working 15-hour days that began at 6:30 a.m.\u201cHe was working so much he would go in with two different socks on,\u201d said       Andrew Hruska,        a childhood friend who worked with Mr. Wray at the department and the law firm. Mr. Wray also ran the department\u2019s criminal division between 2003 and 2005.He comes from a storied New York family. Mr. Wray\u2019s mother, Gilda Wray, is a descendant of Revolutionary War Gen.       Horatio Gates,        and his father and grandfather were partners at a top Wall Street law firm, Debevoise & Plimpton. His uncle,       Edwin Williamson,        was legal adviser to the State Department.The question is whether his reserved demeanor is the right medicine for an agency that has faced harsh scrutiny in recent months. The FBI was thrust into the spotlight when Mr. Comey last year took the unusual step of publicly announcing his recommendation that Mrs. Clinton not face charges for her email arrangement, while also describing her actions as \u201cextremely careless.\u201dSome agents felt Mr. Comey should have let the Justice Department make all public statements in the case.Agents said they hoped Mr. Wray would seek a lower profile than Mr. Comey while continuing his efforts to modernize the bureau and combat the fast-evolving threats of terrorism and cybercrime.\u201cIf he can do an effective job without being in the spotlight, he would prefer it that way, and the bureau really needs that,\u201d said       Joe Robuck,        a former FBI agent who worked with Mr. Wray on a 2000 major corruption case in Atlanta.Mr. Wray has been known as a workhorse since his youth. A serious athlete despite his slight frame, Mr. Wray \u201ctrained harder than everyone else,\u201d Mr. Hruska said, and made the Yale University lightweight crew team, on which       Anderson Cooper,        now a CNN anchor, was the coxswain. A spokeswoman for Mr. Cooper confirmed they were both on Yale\u2019s lightweight crew but said \u201cAnderson has not spoken or seen him in decades.\u201dA philosophy major, Mr. Wray met his future wife, Helen, in his freshman dorm, and the two married the summer after college. As executive editor of the Yale Law Journal, Mr. Wray personally edited every article, Mr. Hruska said, while the editor in chief served as the journal\u2019s public face.Mr. Wray once prosecuted an investment banker represented by his mentor, former deputy attorney general       Larry Thompson,        who is godfather to Mr. Wray\u2019s son. \u201cHe could have pulled a punch and cut a deal\u201d since he was going up against a mentor, said Mr. Richter, who worked as a federal prosecutor with Mr. Wray in Atlanta, but \u201cthat\u2019s not in Chris\u2019s nature.\u201dInstead, jurors watching his courtroom performance took to calling Mr. Wray \u201cthe bulldog,\u201d according to Mr. Robuck, the lead FBI agent on that investigation.Given Mr. Wray\u2019s determined but quiet approach, associates said they expected a notable change in tone from Mr. Comey\u2019s leadership.He \u201cwill always be cautious and circumspect,\u201d Mr. Hruska said, \u201cabout drawing legal conclusions in his public statements.\u201dWrite to Aruna Viswanatha at Aruna.Viswanatha@wsj.com and Del Quentin Wilber at del.wilber@wsj.comAppeared in the July 10, 2017, print edition as 'FBI Nominee Avoids the Spotlight.'", "news_time": "2017-07-09 08:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/fbi-nominee-christopher-wray-known-as-workhorse-who-eschews-spotlight-1499601602", "news_title": "FBI Nominee Christopher Wray Known as Workhorse Who Eschews Spotlight ", "keywords": " comey, confirmation hearing, donald trump,fbi director, president trump, senate hearing,FBI,Senate Judiciary Committee,James Comey,Christopher Wray,political,general news,crime,legal action,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,executive branch,justice department,retail,wholesale,specialty stores"}, {"content": "Two House Republicans plan to propose legislation in the next week that they say would give terminally ill British baby boy       Charlie Gard       permanent residency in the U.S. so he can travel for experimental therapy in America, after U.K. courts ruled doctors should discontinue his life support.The case has been the focus of international attention in recent days, with President       Donald Trump      offering unspecified assistance to Charlie\u2019s family and Pope Francis voicing his support for them. It has also drawn attention to the role of British and European courts in end-of-life decisions for the very young.Brad Wenstrup (R.

His parents later that month asked the European Court of Human Rights to overturn the ruling, but it declined to intervene.The rare genetic disorder, which affects the boy\u2019s brain, breathing and muscles, has left him brain damaged to such an extent, the courts said, that any treatment would be futile and that keeping him on artificial ventilation wasn\u2019t in his best interests.On Friday, the London hospital said fresh evidence about a potential treatment for Charlie from researchers at two international hospitals had prompted it to apply to the U.K. High Court for a new hearing.The hospital\u2019s view on Charlie\u2019s condition hadn\u2019t changed, it said in a statement, but it agreed with the boy\u2019s parents that fresh evidence should be examined.It wasn\u2019t immediately possible to reach lawyers for the boy\u2019s parents Sunday.Rep.

C -0.28%       began testing an ATM that would scan a customer\u2019s iris and make four-digit access codes obsolete. Two years on, Citi has quietly shelved the project.Among the reasons: the cost and complexity of collecting and managing millions of customers\u2019 biometric data. A large database of biometric data is also particularly juicy target for hackers.\u201cIf I steal your password, you make a new password,\u201d said       George Avetisov,        chief executive of HYPR Corp., a banking-technology startup. \u201cBut how do you make a new fingerprint?\u201dPerhaps as a response to that issue, banks are taking a different tack on collecting biometric data. They aim to use the information to replace personal-identification numbers and passwords, but are relying on customers to store and safeguard it themselves\u2014via their own smartphones.Over the past year, lenders such as             Wells Fargo        WFC 0.26%       & Co.,             J.P. Morgan Chase        JPM 0.14%       & Co. and Bank of America Corp. have started to roll out new ATMs that can link to customers\u2019 mobile devices. Customers will sign in through their phones, potentially using a fingerprint, and then transmit a code to the ATM.Though this adds a step to the identification process, customers are nonetheless eager to ditch the numerous PINs and passwords needed for transactions. Mobile phones are also one device on which biometrics has worked, as about two billion units globally can use fingerprints, pictures of eyes and faces, and voice recognition, according to HYPR. Those tools are already widely used for signing in to mobile-banking applications.Citigroup\u2019s apps, for example, use voice, face and fingerprint recognition, although the bank has yet to roll out cardless ATMs. As for the iris-reading ATMs, Citigroup has \u201creasons ranging from logistical to operational\u201d for not pursuing them at this time, a spokesman said.Other banks have shared similar difficulties with how to approach biometric data. A survey by the U.K.\u2019s University of Oxford and             Mastercard Inc.       published in June found that while nine out of 10 bankers wanted to take advantage of biometrics, only about a third reported a good experience so far using the technology.An added complication is that, unlike some other countries, the U.S. doesn\u2019t have national identification databases. In countries such as Chile, which does have such a database, banks could tap into it to enable customers to sign into an ATM with a fingerprint. So, banks in the U.S. are on their own to figure out how to record and store customers\u2019 biometric markers. That process adds extra steps, complexity and cost.Meanwhile, the need for next-generation ATMs is urgent. For one, card fraud is rising despite new security measures such as chip-enabled cards.             Fair Isaac Corp.      , a credit-data provider, has said it detected a 70% uptick in compromised cards being used at ATMs and merchants in 2016.Though ATMs\u2014introduced 50 years ago\u2014might seem quaint in the mobile age, their usage remains strong, and banks are still investing in them. Last year, J.P. Morgan, for example, increased the number of ATMs it owns by 4%, even as it closed 3% of its branches. In January, Citigroup nearly doubled the size of its ATM network with a deal to add 30,000 locations at retailers.In their quest to use smartphones for biometrics, banks are relying on processes that are already well established. A customer using a phone at an ATM would authenticate her identify, using, say, a fingerprint as is the case with             Apple Inc.\u2019s       iPhone and Apple Pay.The phone would then create an individual digital token and transmit that to the ATM. That would validate the transaction without revealing any underlying biometric data to the bank.\u2018Banks are reutilizing what they learned about biometrics through mobile.\u2019That means banks wouldn\u2019t have to protect treasure troves of genetic templates from hackers. This is because the biometric data would be stored on individual devices, not in a central location.\u201cWith tokens, there\u2019s no use in attacking the bank server,\u201d said HYPR\u2019s Mr. Avetisov. Such digital tokens are already widely used in mobile-payment applications and they are also generated by the chips now embedded in most credit cards.That approach does shift more of the security burden to the user. People must protect their phone from being imitated or hacked, and will have to be conscious of their phone\u2019s security measures. \u201cThink of your phone as becoming like your house keys,\u201d Mr. Avetisov said. \u201cBut hackers want the biggest payoff and attacking one person is a more difficult and low-profit attack.\u201dDavid Kuchenski,        director of business development for design and new technology at             Diebold Nixdorf Inc.,       which built the eye-reading ATM that Citigroup tested in 2015, said those units were a few years ahead of their time.\u201cPeople have gotten so used to biometrics on their phones,\u201d he said. \u201cSo banks are reutilizing what they learned about biometrics through mobile.\u201dLast year, Wells Fargo was touting the potential for ATMs with biometric readers built into them in its annual investor presentation, among other biometric capabilities. This year, the same presentation featured biometric authentication on a mobile device. A spokeswoman said Wells Fargo has \u201cno current plans\u201d to implement biometrics at its ATMs.Later this year and in 2018 Wells Fargo will enable customers to tap their phones at ATMs using apps such as Apple Pay and Android Pay, from Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google, which use a fingerprint for access.But smartphones may pose a different risk for banks, by empowering tech companies to compete more directly with them, said Lex Sokolin, head of fintech strategy at Autonomous Research. Apple, for example, recently launched a mobile peer-to-peer money-transfer service that competes with banks\u2019 apps.\u201cIf Apple and Google continue to gain share in the physical world, they will control authentication,\u201d Mr. Sokolin said.\u2014Emily Glazer contributed to this article.Write to Telis Demos at telis.demos@wsj.comAppeared in the July 10, 2017, print edition as 'For Phones, an ATM Role.'", "news_time": "2017-07-09 07:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-your-phone-will-be-the-key-to-atms-of-the-future-1499598001", "news_title": "Why Your Phone Will Be the Key to ATMs of the Future   ", "keywords": "atms,automated teller machines,biometric data,biometrics,consumer issues,finreg,fintech,Citigroup,C,J.P.

It will also determine whether Republicans are able to deliver on a seven-year-old campaign promise to repeal the law.It is a bedeviling assignment, made harder after Mr. Trump recently suggested in a tweet they could repeal the 2010 health law and replace it later. The majority leader\u00a0can lose only two Republican votes and still drive the GOP health bill through the Senate, and he has threatened to cut a final deal with Democrats if his caucus doesn\u2019t get in line.\u201cNo action is not an alternative,\u201d       Mr. McConnell       said at a Rotary Club lunch in Kentucky last week.Few people are willing to write       Mr. McConnell\u2019s       threats off, given his credentials as a smart, tenacious strategist who hates losing\u2014a distaste developed long ago.As a sophomore at the University of Louisville\u2019s College of Arts and Sciences,       Mr. McConnell       thought he had enough votes\u00a0from among his fraternity brothers to be elected student-council president.\u00a0He lost by one vote.       Mr. McConnell       hunted down the turncoat and accused the fraternity brother of tipping one of the voting members of the council against him.\u201cI know what you did in student council,\u201d       Mr. McConnell       fumed to Jeremy Jones, Mr. Jones recounted in an interview. \u201cI was all for you, but now I\u2019m against you,\u201d he said.Mr. McConnell was elected student-council president the following year. Through a spokesman, Mr. McConnell said the only remarkable thing about the loss was that he decided to run the next year, and won.\u201cNever underestimate Mitch McConnell,\u201d Sen.       Heidi Heitkamp       (D., N.D.) said.In his effort to assemble the votes to pass a bill before an August recess, Mr. McConnelll, 75 years old, will rely on\u00a0skills he has honed since childhood, including keeping his cards close, using every tool to build a coalition and moving decisively when the moment is right.The distance he has kept from Mr. Trump, whose approval rating is about 40%, reflects the way Mr. McConnell has sought political safety\u2014and leaving his options open\u2014by keeping his head down and his circle of confidants tight. The Kentucky senator is renowned for avoiding small-talk with fellow lawmakers on long overseas flights by keeping his nose buried in history books. Some congressional aides refer to Mr. McConnell as \u201cthe lockbox.\u201dDemocrats and some Republicans complain that he is taking the same approach to writing a health-care bill, which featured no public hearings and no input from the other party. \u201cIf you at least have open committee hearings and hear from both sides, I think that\u2019s better,\u201d said fellow Kentucky Republican Sen.       Rand Paul       in late June.Mr. McConnell, who declined to be interviewed, operates on the assumption that sharing too much information can be damaging.\u201cMost campaigns err, he believes, by talking too freely with media about matters they should be keeping confidential,\u00a0or under more calculated control,\u201d conservative\u00a0lawyer\u00a0John Dyche wrote in a book about the majority leader.A son of a midlevel manager, Mr. McConnell has spent a lifetime studying the elements of power. He believes not in\u00a0the power of\u00a0personal relationships but in the power of political leverage\u2014and a lightning-sharp willingness to dress down those who don\u2019t bend his way.Mr. McConnell didn\u2019t hesitate to tell White House chief of staff Reince Priebus that it was \u201cincredibly stupid\u201d for a Trump-aligned group to run ads pressuring Sen. Dean Heller (R., Nev.)\u00a0into backing the health bill, according to a GOP operative with knowledge of the conversation. The outside group pulled the advertisement.And, at a recent\u00a0Senate leadership meeting, Mr. McConnell confronted Sen. Rob Portman (R., Ohio), asking whether the man who was balking at the\u00a0bill\u2019s cuts to Medicaid funding was the same person who had backed changes to entitlement programs as head of the White House budget office under       George W. Bush,        according to a person familiar with the conversation.The blunt attack stunned some meeting participants, this person said, and prompted\u00a0Mr. Portman to defend himself, saying he supported overhauling entitlements but thought Republican leaders had overreached.Mr. McConnell is also willing to do a bit of horse trading to line up votes.During high school\u00a0in Louisville, Mr. McConnell quietly enlisted the most popular girl in his class, a cheerleader, to manage his campaign to be student-council president.\u00a0She helped line up the jocks and cheerleaders behind him and helped him defeat\u00a0the candidate Mr. McConnell says\u00a0was the front-runner in the race.\u201cHe\u2019s always been incredibly driven,\u201d said Terry McCoy, the classmate who lost.Elected to the Senate in 1984, Mr. McConnell\u00a0had served as an aide to two senators from Kentucky and spent decades studying the whims and attitudes of\u00a0his future colleagues.\u201cYou really have to have almost a mental framework or scoresheet or balance sheet against which you are able to keep counting,\u201d said former Sen. Richard Lugar (R., Ind.).To advance the GOP health bill, Mr. McConnell has floated adding $45 billion\u00a0to the bill to combat opioid addiction and to expand health-savings accounts so that\u00a0the tax-advantaged funds can be used to pay health-insurance premiums, according to outside groups and Republican aides who have followed the negotiations.That opioid provision is aimed at winning over Mr. Portman and Sen.       Shelley Moore Capito       from West Virginia, whose states have been beset with drug overdoses, and conservatives like Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, who has pushed the health-savings-account idea.If he can package together an acceptable bill, Mr. McConnell is expected to push to get the legislation through as soon as possible.When Mr. Trump earlier this year proposed that the Senate change its rules so that all legislation could pass with a simple majority, Mr. McConnell simply said \u201cwe\u2019re not going to do that.\u201d The president dropped the subject.Mr. McConnell wrote in his book that he learned the lesson of good timing in grade school, when he watched little boys boxing and concluded that the one who stood his ground\u2014and not the one who exhausted himself by throwing the most punches\u2014won\u00a0the fight.\u201cBeing effective, and staying around for a while, requires a penchant for standing firm,\u201d Mr. McConnell wrote.Now, Mr. McConnell is calculating that standing firm and forcing Senate Republicans to come to a consensus on a GOP health bill is a winning strategy.\u201cWhat he is basically doing for the Republican Party is saying you\u2019re going to put up or shut up on Obamacare,\u201d said Scott Jennings, a former campaign adviser to Mr. McConnell.\u2014Jim Oberman contributed to this article.Write to Siobhan Hughes at siobhan.hughes@wsj.comAppeared in the July 10, 2017, print edition as 'McConnell Deploys Steely Drive on Hill.'", "news_time": "2017-07-09 07:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/mitch-mcconnell-bobs-and-weaves-through-health-care-fight-1499598002", "news_title": "Mitch McConnell Bobs and Weaves Through Health-Care Fight", "keywords": "Mr. McConnell,Dean Heller,John Dyche,Rob Portman,Mitch McConnell,Rand Paul,Reince Priebus,political,general news,health,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,elections,upper house,health care,life sciences"}, {"content": "MALTEPE, Turkey\u2014As Turkey prepares nationwide commemorations marking last year\u2019s failed military coup, the country is divided over a single word\u2014justice\u2014and where to find it.For nearly a month,       Kemal Kilicdaroglu,        leader of the main opposition Republican People\u2019s Party, or CHP, has been seeking justice\u00a0along\u00a0State Road D100. His protest march\u00a0from the capital Ankara, which ended\u00a0Sunday in an Istanbul suburb,\u00a0was intended to highlight what many see as a sharp undemocratic tilt in their nation.\u201cDo we have a republic? No. We have one man on a hill who gives all the orders,\u201d said Mr. Kilicdaroglu in a recent interview along on the 260-mile march, which\u00a0some liken to       Mahatma Gandhi\u2019s       Salt March of civil disobedience in part because of the two men\u2019s physical likeness.Officials in Turkey\u2019s ruling party say Mr. Kilicdaroglu is looking in the wrong place. \u201cYou don\u2019t seek justice in the streets,\u201d Prime Minister\u00a0      Binali Yildirim       said shortly after his political opponent started the march on\u00a0June 15. He chided Mr. Kilicdaroglu for not working through parliament.The\u00a0thousands\u00a0of Justice Marchers who joined Mr. Kilicdaroglu\u00a0along one of Turkey\u2019s main highways\u00a0brought public\u00a0attention on a topic that is hard for the ruling party to ignore. The protest\u00a0also threatens to dim the spotlight on a week of events led by\u00a0President       Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s       government to mark\u00a0the uprising,\u00a0in which at least 270 people died. The CHP opposed last year\u2019s coup.The government plans to unveil monuments across the country, including a nearly 100-foot-tall sculpture depicting heroic citizens raising the Turkish star-and-crescent across from the presidential palace in Ankara. The government also will hold a series of \u201cdemocracy watches,\u201d echoing the mass rallies it held in the immediate aftermath of the coup attempt, as well as official visits to graveyards.Mr. Erdogan will address the nation early on\u00a0July 16, marking\u00a0the time a year earlier when the tide turned against the coup.On that day, military jets bombed parliament and tanks opened fire on the streets of Istanbul and Ankara. Millions of citizens from across Turkey\u2019s deeply divided political landscape mobilized overnight in a show of nonpartisan people power.But that surge of national unity quickly fizzled, as the government used to the state of emergency called in the aftermath of the coup to purge tens of thousands of civil servants and arrest tens of thousands more.The purges predominantly targeted people in the political opposition, not members of Mr. Erdogan\u2019s ruling Justice and Development Party party, despite their onetime close political alliance with the cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom the government blames for the coup. Mr. Gulen, who lives in the U.S., has denied any role in it.At least a dozen trials are under way of military officials and civilians accused of treason and murder for their alleged roles in the coup\u2014as well as alleged ties with Mr. Gulen.The main trial of senior military officers alleged to be among the \u201cPeace at Home Council\u201d\u00a0that was purportedly\u00a0to take charge of the country in the event of a successful coup is set to wrap up this month in a specially built courthouse attached to the Sincan prison outside Ankara.The trials have become morality plays about contemporary Turkey, with AKP officials urging citizens to attend as an act of patriotism and newspapers deriding arguments offered by the defense, reflecting broad national sentiment against the defendants.The centrist Posta newspaper headline about a trial that opened in May was\u00a0\u201cTraitors\u2019 day of account\u201d while the pro-government Yeni Safak\u2019s headline was \u201cYou are all murderers.\u201d\u00a0Most media outlets published\u00a0images of the mob outside the courthouse chanting for the death penalty as the suspects passed.Mr. Yildirim has expressed impatience with the slow progress of the trials and defendants\u2019 expressions of innocence.\u201cIt is certain who dropped the bomb, who gave them permission, who killed people, who drove the tanks and who flew the planes. What are we waiting for?\u201d Mr. Yildirim told journalists last month.Mr. Kilicdaroglu, a mild-mannered former bureaucrat, feels a similar impatience. He decided\u00a0to protest\u00a0after one of his CHP lawmakers, a former journalist,\u00a0was convicted for spying.\u00a0That followed Erdogan-backed constitutional changes which narrowly passed in an April referendum that the CHP says was fraudulent.Mr. Kilicdaroglu said he has given up on Turkey\u2019s judicial system, turning to a march for justice for all those who stand against what they perceive as creeping authoritarianism in government and in the judiciary. Some opposition leaders with the CHP have participated, but it is unclear whether Mr. Kilicdaroglu has attracted broad support beyond his party.The party faithful dominated recent crowds, with local CHP chapters bussing in protestors for the day and CHP politicians setting up roadside stands to dole out Turkish delight to hungry marchers.Mr. Kilicdaroglu promises that this protest is just the beginning.\u201cThe more we march, the more uncomfortable Erdogan feels,\u201d Mr. Kilicdaroglu said. \u201cHis discomfort makes me very happy.\u201dWrite to Ned Levin at ned.levin@wsj.com and Margaret Coker at margaret.coker@wsj.comAppeared in the July 10, 2017, print edition as 'Failed Coup Left Turkey Divided.'", "news_time": "2017-07-09 05:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/one-year-after-turkish-coup-search-for-justice-roils-nation-1499592600", "news_title": "One Year After Turkish Coup, \n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\tSearch for Justice Roils Nation", "keywords": "turkey and coup, turkey and march, turkey anniversary of coup,political,general news,national,public security,armed rebellion,politics,international relations,domestic politics,risk news,military action"}, {"content": "SEOUL\u2014The U.S. sent two B-1B bombers to the Korean Peninsula to practice \u201cattack capabilities\u201d with South Korean jet fighters Friday, the latest show of force by the U.S. military following North Korea\u2019s first-ever intercontinental ballistic missile test launch last week.The joint exercise, which included U.S. F-16 fighters jets as well as fighter planes from the South Korean and Japanese air forces, came a day after U.S. President       Donald Trump       said in Warsaw on Thursday that he was considering \u201csome pretty severe things\u201d in response to North Korea\u2019s latest actions.Friday\u2019s flyover also followed a joint missile drill by the U.S. and South Korean armies on Korea\u2019s east coast Wednesday.It was met with a sharp denunciation from Pyongyang, which called the B-1B drill \u201ca dangerous military move of the war maniacs to ignite a nuclear war on the Korean peninsula.\u201d\u201cThe danger of a nuclear war on the Korean peninsula is reaching an extreme pitch owing to the reckless military provocations of the U.S. imperialists,\u201d North Korea\u2019s Rodong Sinmun newspaper said in a commentary Sunday, according to the state-run Korean Central News Agency.The U.S. Pacific Air Forces said in a statement late Friday that its 10-hour flight drill was conducted \u201cin response to a series of increasingly escalatory actions by North Korea,\u201d the U.S. Pacific Air Forces said in a statement late Friday.\u201cNorth Korea\u2019s actions are a threat to our allies, partners and homeland,\u201d Gen. Terrence O\u2019       Shaughnessy,        Pacific Air Forces commander, said in a statement. \u201cLet me be clear, if called upon we are trained, equipped and ready to unleash the full lethal capability of our allied air forces.\u201dDuring the drill, two B-1B bombers flew from Andersen Air Force Base in Guam to the Korean Peninsula where they released inert weapons on an air force training range in South Korea, about 90 miles south of the demilitarized zone that divides the Korean Peninsula. They were joined by South Korean and U.S. F-16 jet fighters during the mission.The B-1Bs then flew with Japanese F-2 jet fighters over the East China Sea before returning to Guam.The U.S. has been making shows of force in recent months in response to perceived increases in tension on the Korean Peninsula.Twice in May, the U.S. sent B-1B bombers on flyovers near the Korean Peninsula. Each came shortly after a North Korean missile test.In April, the U.S. said it was sending the USS Carl Vinson carrier strike group to the western Pacific to underscore Washington\u2019s commitment to the region. In that case, the announcement instead raised questions about U.S. credibility after it came to light that the aircraft carrier was thousands of miles away.On Thursday, U.S. Secretary of Defense       Jim Mattis       told reporters in an impromptu briefing at the Pentagon that \u201cwe are leading with diplomatic and economic efforts.\u201dBut he also called North Korea\u2019s ICBM launch on Tuesday last week a \u201cvery serious escalation\u201d and warned the North that any effort to start a war \u201cwould lead to severe consequences.\u201dSeparately on Thursday, South Korean President Moon Jae-in said in a speech in Berlin that he was seeking more engagement with North Korea, and would be willing to meet with North Korean leader       Kim Jong Un       \u201cat any time, at any place,\u201d provided certain conditions were met.In its statement following Friday\u2019s air force exercise, the U.S. said that it \u201cmaintains flexible bomber and jet fighter capabilities\u201d in the region and could \u201cquickly respond to any regional threat.\u201dThe U.S. bombers and South Korean fighters \u201care just two of many lethal military options at our disposal,\u201d said Lt. Gen.       Thomas Bergeson,        deputy commander of the U.S. military in South Korea.\u201cThis mission clearly demonstrates the U.S.-ROK alliance remains prepared to use the full range of capabilities to defend and to preserve the security of the Korean Peninsula and region,\u201d Lt. Gen. Bergeson added, using the acronym for South Korea\u2019s formal name, the Republic of Korea.Write to Jonathan Cheng at jonathan.cheng@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-09 02:51:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-practice-attack-capabilities-with-south-korea-1499486950", "news_title": "U.S. Shows Off \u2018Attack Capabilities\u2019 After North Korea Missile Test", "keywords": "icbm,north korea missiles,north korea nuclear,north korea weapons,us bombers,us pacific forces,U.S. Army Air Force,U.S. Pacific Air Forces,air force,political,general news,national,public security,armed forces,nuclear weapons programs,risk news,military action,weapons programs,aerospace products,parts,military aircraft,aerospace,defense,defense equipment,products,industrial goods"}]
