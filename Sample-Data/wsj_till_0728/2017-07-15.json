[{"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said late Saturday he would put off a vote on a Republican health-care bill that had been set for next week so that Sen.       John McCain,        who is recovering from an unexpected surgery, can participate.Mr. McCain, an Arizona Republican, had surgery Friday to remove a blood clot from above his left eye after a routine physical, his doctors said Saturday. Mr. McCain\u2019s office said the senator, on the advice of his doctors, would spend next week recovering in Arizona.\u201cWhile John is recovering, the Senate will continue our work on legislative items and nominations, and will defer consideration of the Better Care Act,\u201d Mr. McConnell said.With 52 Republicans in the Senate, Mr. McConnell could afford to lose no more than two GOP votes, even with Vice President       Mike Pence       casting a tiebreaking vote. GOP Sens.       Susan Collins       of Maine and       Rand Paul       of Kentucky had said they would oppose advancing the bill in a procedural motion next week. No Democrats are expected to support the bill.In the House, GOP leaders pulled their health-care bill from the floor in late March after a series of setbacks. The House bill finally passed in May.It isn\u2019t yet clear what the result of the delay resulting from Mr. McCain\u2019s surgery will be, but Republican leaders generally have sought to push the bill ahead with a combination of speed and pressure, and are aware that delays from a congressional recess or other factors give a longer opportunity for opponents of the GOP bill to mobilize.Senate GOP leaders have struggled to corral support for the bill, which would dismantle much of the 2010 health law, set up a new system of tax credits to help some people buy insurance and dramatically curb federal spending on Medicaid. Conservatives had criticized the legislation for not rolling back enough of the Affordable Care Act, while centrist Republicans had fretted over the bill\u2019s deep cuts to Medicaid. The Senate bill would trim $772 billion in federal Medicaid funding over a decade.Last Thursday, Mr. McConnell unveiled a new version of the bill that sought to win over centrists with an added $45 billion in opioid funding and more money to help bring down premiums. But many Republicans in states that expanded Medicaid under the ACA said they still had concerns over scaling back the federal government\u2019s support for that program.Mr. McConnell had warned Republicans that if they hit an impasse over the bill, they would need to work with Democrats to shore up the faltering individual market, where people can buy insurance if they don\u2019t get it through their employer or the government.Already some GOP senators, including       Lindsey Graham       of South Carolina and Mr. McCain, had said they are open to working with Democrats.Write to Siobhan Hughes at siobhan.hughes@wsj.com, Louise Radnofsky at louise.radnofsky@wsj.com and Kristina Peterson at kristina.peterson@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-15 23:16:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/republican-health-bill-to-be-delayed-as-sen-john-mccain-recovers-from-surgery-1500173998", "news_title": "Republican Health Bill to Be Delayed as Sen.

Mr. Trump rewarded their enthusiasm with frequent trips to the edges of the box to wave and clap, drawing emotional cheers and anxious looks from organizers trying to quiet the crowd for the nearby golfers.Fans of the game, meanwhile, had to effectively turn their backs on the president\u2019s box to see the proceedings on the course.\u00a0A few muttered disappointment that he\u2019d shown up; one woman said she loved women\u2019s golf and wanted to support the game, but was angry it was at Mr. Trump\u2019s property and that he was there.The president wrote several times on his Twitter account that he would be in attendance at the event over Friday and Saturday. Those messages drew some fans to the event, such as       Lisa Hiebert       of\u00a0Long Valley, N.J.,\u00a0a commercial insurance underwriter who said she loved men\u2019s golf but had attended the women\u2019s game \u201cjust to get behind here and support him, because he\u2019s going through a lot right now.\u201dMs. Hiebert cited stock-market gains and employment numbers that the president had written about on his Twitter account about shortly before she saw him. \u201cHe cares about us,\u201d she said.\u00a0\u201cForget all this Russian other crap.\u201dShe quickly made friends around the viewing box as they waved to try to catch the president\u2019s attention and get him to wave back. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to find people who feel like I do,\u201d she said, hugging a woman she had just met, and then wiping away tears after she was successful in eliciting a response from Mr. Trump. \u201cAw, that was so awesome!\u201d she said. \u201cOh my God, we just waved to our president, isn\u2019t that crazy?\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s lengthy appearance at the event, which also included an hour in the box on Friday late afternoon, offered a rare view of him on the weekends he has typically spent at golf clubs he owns in Florida, Virginia and New Jersey, but where reporters aren\u2019t able to follow him and the White House has refused to confirm how he has spent his time.On this Saturday, however, White House reporters, golf reporters, and any person passing by could see the president relaxing, eating french fries and entertaining guests including some of the day\u2019s competitors.Many passersby stopped to look for Mr. Trump\u2019s familiar red baseball cap, which he wore over a white dress shirt and dark suit Saturday; some lifted their children to get a better view, pulled out a selfie-stick to pose for pictures with him in the background, or phoned friends to report what they were seeing.Joining Mr. Trump at the event were his sons Eric and Barron; Eric Trump\u2019s wife Lara; and       Dan Scavino,        a social-media adviser and former golf caddie and club manager, who sat near the edge of the box for much of the afternoon with two screens up.For the golfers taking part in the event, avoiding any partisan social-media tumult regarding whether the president\u2019s presence was disrupting the proceedings or shining a spotlight on it required some deft linguistic strokes. Several competitors, in interviews, walked a fine line.\u201cI honestly had no idea where he actually was,\u201d said       Stacy Lewis,        an Olympian of the president\u2019s arrival Friday. She went on to repeat the United States Golf Association statement of earlier Friday, that \u201cwe have never had an active, sitting president at one of our events before.\u201dLexi Thompson,        a Florida-based golfer who has played with the president before, told reporters Mr. Trump \u201cplays very fast\u201d and she felt \u201cpretty comfortable\u201d knowing he was out on Friday.On Saturday, the president didn\u2019t turn to watch her when she reached the 15th hole close to the box. Indeed, for much of the day, the president focused on the game on the screen, and on his guests inside the box and on the ground below, pausing only occasionally toward the and of the day to look at action on the course.Toward the end of the competition, Ms. Thompson and her parents came to the viewing box to meet the president and pose for photographs.\u201cThis is his golf course. I\u2019m just out here playing golf, playing the U.S. Women\u2019s Open,\u201d she said Saturday.Write to Louise Radnofsky at louise.radnofsky@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-15 20:58:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trump-is-both-spectator-and-spectacle-at-womens-golf-event-1500166725", "news_title": "Donald Trump Is Both Spectator and Spectacle at Women\u2019s Golf Event", "keywords": "donald trump golf,donald trump golf course,trump golf,trump watches golf,u.s. women's open,Donald Trump,political,general news,golf,politics,international relations,domestic politics,sports,government bodies,executive branch,routine general news,online service providers,media,entertainment,social media platforms,tools,technology"}, {"content": "Elon Musk       warned a gathering of U.S. governors that they need to be concerned about the potential dangers from the rise of artificial intelligence and called for the creation of a regulatory body to guide development of the powerful technology.Speaking Saturday at the National Governors Association meeting in Rhode Island, the chief executive of electric-car maker             Tesla Inc.       and rocket maker Space Exploration Technologies Corp. laid out several worst-case scenarios for AI, saying that the technology will threaten all human jobs and that an AI could even spark a war. \u201cIt is the biggest risk that we face as a civilization,\u201d he said.Mr. Musk has been vocal about his concerns about AI and helped create OpenAI, a nonprofit research group that aims for the safe development of the technology. He suggested to the governors that a regulatory agency needs to be formed to begin gaining insight into fast-moving AI development, followed by putting regulations into place.\u201cRight now the government doesn\u2019t even have insight,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce there is awareness people will be extremely afraid, as they should be.\u201dProponents of AI say such concerns are premature, given the current state of the technology. Arizona Gov.       Doug Ducey,        a Republican who said that he has spent his own career trying to reduce government regulations, questioned Mr. Musk over the suggestion of creating new rules, saying that he was unsure what policy makers could do beyond pushing for a slowdown in development. \u201cI was surprised by your suggestion to bring regulations before we know what we are dealing with,\u201d Mr. Ducey said.\u201cFor sure the companies doing AI\u2014most of them, not mine\u2014will squawk and say this is really going to stop innovation,\u201d Mr. Musk said. But he said he doubted that such a move would cause companies to leave the U.S.During his talk, Mr. Musk also was asked about the pressures that come from the valuation of Tesla, whose stock has risen more than 50% this year ahead of the introduction of a new sedan. The market capitalization has made Tesla bigger than             Ford Motor Co.       and, at times, larger than             General Motors Co.Those auto makers, unlike Tesla, are profitable and sell many more vehicles than the niche luxury brand.Mr. Musk reiterated that shares of Tesla are trading at a price \u201chigher than we have any right to deserve\u201d and that the high price reflects optimism over the company\u2019s future.\u201cThose expectations sometimes get out of control,\u201d he said. But Mr. Musk said he is committed to making Tesla a success. Besides selling shares to pay for taxes, Mr. Musk said he is avoiding selling company shares. \u201cI\u2019m going down with the ship,\u201d he said.Write to Tim Higgins at Tim.Higgins@WSJ.comAppeared in the July 17, 2017, print edition as 'Tesla Boss Warns on Artificial Intelligence.'", "news_time": "2017-07-15 17:32:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musk-warns-nations-governors-of-looming-ai-threat-calls-for-regulations-1500154345", "news_title": "Elon Musk Lays Out Worst-Case Scenario for AI Threat", "keywords": "ai development,ai regulation,ai research,artificial intelligence,elon musk,research and development,science and technology,tesla,Space Exploration Technologies,Elon Musk,regulation,government policy,regulatory bodies,capacity,facilities,automation,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,sciences,humanities,motor vehicles,alternative fuel vehicles,aerospace products,parts,space vehicles,aerospace,defense,automotive,industrial goods,technology"}, {"content": "PARIS\u2014In Washington earlier this week, President       Donald Trump       remained out of the public eye amid a political furor over his associates\u2019 talks with Russians. In Paris, he was a star.Over the course of a roughly 24-hour trip to the City of Light, he was treated to an elaborate military welcome ceremony, dinner at a Michelin-star restaurant inside the Eiffel Tower and a two-hour Bastille Day parade featuring dozens of tanks and airplanes along with a military band\u2019s rendition of the music of the French group Daft Punk.French President       Emmanuel Macron       praised relations with his U.S. counterpart in a friendly news conference on Thursday, and said Friday morning that Mr. Trump and first lady Melania Trump\u2019s attendance at the parade was a \u201csign of a friendship that lasts through time.\u201dEarlier this year, Mr. Trump had declared Paris was \u201cno longer Paris\u201d due to growing threats of terrorism. But seated on the reviewing stand at the Place de la Concorde on Friday, Mr. Trump\u2014who considered holding a military parade to celebrate his inauguration but ultimately opted against it\u2014grew animated as the aircraft began flying overhead, clapping and leaning toward Mr. Macron and his wife to point at the sky.The trip was largely positive for the two leaders, who both see an advantage in bolstering their ties and moving past the deep divisions on trade and climate change on display at last week\u2019s Group of 20 world leaders summit in Hamburg. There, 19 of the G-20 leaders issued a joint statement on climate change that one French official said was aimed at ensuring that the U.S. \u201cis clearly identified as being alone.\u201dOn Thursday, Mr. Macron sought to strike a different tone, calling for world leaders to move past their differences. \u201cDoes that mean we have to stop talking about the other subjects? No, resolutely and in no case,\u201d he said.A low point for Mr. Trump on the short visit came Thursday, when he was captured on video on the French presidential Facebook account complimenting France\u2019s first lady, Brigitte Macron. \u201cYou\u2019re in such good shape,\u201d he told her, before turning to Mr. Macron and remarking, \u201cShe\u2019s in such good physical shape.\u201dThe comment was described in the French press with disdain and surprise, with suggestions that it was inappropriately drawing attention to the age difference between Mr. Macron and his wife. Mr. Macron is 39, Mrs. Macron 64.\u201cEven if it isn\u2019t a sexist remark or a reference to the age of Brigitte Macron, the formulation seems at best maladroit,\u201d French daily Le Parisien wrote about the exchange.Barring that clumsy compliment, for Mr. Macron, Mr. Trump\u2019s visit went without a hitch.Before the visit, the stakes were high for the French leader. After his May election victory, Mr. Macron has surfed a wave of popularity that he needs to maintain as he pushes spending cuts and unpopular changes to labor laws. Mr. Trump is deeply unpopular in France and viewed with suspicion for his opposition to the Paris Accord.Yet the French leader\u2019s risky bet on the U.S. leader\u2019s visit seemed to be paying dividends. A nationally representative survey by polling company Odoxa showed that 61% of French people thought Mr. Macron was right to invite his U.S. counterpart for the Bastille Day celebrations. Even a slight majority of left-leaning French voters\u2014usually the most critical of Mr. Trump\u2014approved of Mr. Macron\u2019s invitation to Mr. Trump for the military show on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, the poll showed.\u201cEven if French people hate Mr. Trump, they broadly approve the decision of Mr. Macron,\u201d said Ga\u00ebl Sliman, head of Odoxa.Mr. Trump on Thursday said he and Mr. Macron had discussed their differences over climate change and the American president dangled the prospect of rejoining the Paris climate accord in the future, after deciding earlier this year to withdraw the U.S. from the international pact.\u201cSomething could happen with respect to the Paris accord, but we\u2019ll see what happens,\u201d he said.In a briefing aboard Air Force One on Friday, White House homeland security adviser Tom Bossert said the issue wasn\u2019t discussed at the extended bilateral meeting between the two leaders and their senior advisers a day earlier. \u201cThe topic didn\u2019t chill or infect or in any way come up verbally or through nonverbal cues in our conversations,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are no kinks in that relationship.\u201dWhile the leaders issued no major proclamations following two hours of talks on Thursday, officials said they discussed a range of issues. The talks focused largely on joint counterterrorism efforts, including a shared objective of eliminating \u201cterrorist propaganda\u201d from social media, Mr. Bossert said.He said talks would continue on the staff level as the nations examine whether there is a \u201cneed to compel that removal\u201d or whether the governments can work with social-media companies to remove such material.Messrs. Trump and Macron also discussed the cease-fire in Syria, which went into effect on Sunday; how to limit Iranian sponsorship for extremists and how to handle a feud between Qatar and four other Arab nations that both the U.S. and France want resolved, Mr. Bossert said.Mr. Trump on Friday also spoke by phone with Saudi Arabia\u2019s King Salman to discuss the conflict, the White House said.Following the parade, the Trumps departed Paris to fly home\u2014not to Washington, but to Bedminster, N.J., where the president owns a golf resort.Write to Rebecca Ballhaus at Rebecca.Ballhaus@wsj.com and William Horobin at William.Horobin@wsj.comAppeared in the July 15, 2017, print edition as 'Trump\u2019s Visit to Paris Ends on Grand Parade.'", "news_time": "2017-07-15 15:15:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/for-trump-little-beats-a-military-parade-1500026510", "news_title": "Bastille Day Parade in Paris Enthralls President Trump ", "keywords": "bastille day,champs-elysees,france u.s.,military parade,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,executive branch"}, {"content": "LONDON\u2014The chance was there for       Venus Williams.       Two of them, actually.Two set points on       Garbi\u00f1e Muguruza\u2019s       serve, two chances to get within striking distance of a sixth Wimbledon singles title and to become, at 37 years old, the oldest women\u2019s singles champion of the modern era.Muguruza wouldn\u2019t have any of it, outlasting Williams in a long rally, then coming up with big serves in reeling off four straight points to knot the first set at 5-5. She never lost another game, as Williams spread errors all across Wimbledon\u2019s grass, and Muguruza triumphed 7-5, 6-0.In beating Williams, who began playing here when Muguruza was a toddler, the Venezuela-born Spaniard ended a storybook run for the seven-time grand slam singles champion. Knowing that Williams wanted to attack, Muguruza focused on pounding the ball deep, landing it so often in the scruffy brown grass and dirt near the Centre Court baseline that she prevented Williams from executing her usual strategy of coming in and ending points early.\u201cFinally!\u201d said a jubilant Muguruza when it was over. She lost the final here two years ago to       Serena Williams,        Venus\u2019 younger sister, and grew up worshiping the Williams sisters. Serena Williams, the GOAT (greatest of all time) of women\u2019s tennis, is pregnant and couldn\u2019t play this tournament. \u201cIt\u2019s satisfying to go out there and win over someone who is like a role model to you.\u201dWith a misty rain falling in the early afternoon, tournament officials opted to close the roof rather than wait out the weather. The move figured to favor Williams. She serves harder than Muguruza, and the closed roof tends to raise the humidity level inside Centre Court, making the grass slicker. That keeps the ball low and provides an advantage to bigger servers.But Williams\u2019 biggest weapons\u2014especially her screaming second serve\u2014weren\u2019t firing Saturday. In the second set she won just 40% of the points on her first serve and none of the five on her second ball.And yet, what was at first a tight match turned decisively in that crucial 10th game, when Williams couldn\u2019t close out the first set. Usually steely on the big stage, Williams appeared rattled by the missed opportunity.In the next game, Williams\u2019 forehand, an occasionally shaky shot for her, all but disappeared. Three bad forehand errors helped give Muguruza the crucial break. Minutes later, on her second set point, Muguruza pinned Williams deep in the corner and forced her to net a tough backhand.\u201cI would have loved to have converted those,\u201d Williams said wistfully of her set-point chances.For a crowd desperate to see Williams make history, the second set became painful to watch. Williams double-faulted to lose the first game, won just 12 points in all and committed 21 errors. On match point, Williams, fittingly, sent a forehand from the baseline long. It was initially ruled in, though the replay revealed the ball had landed several inches out. In just 77 minutes, Williams\u2019 storybook narrative was crushed.She plans to try again. \u201cI\u2019d like to win,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to just get to a final.\u201dMuguruza was without her coach,       Sam Sumyk,        for this tournament. Sumyk\u2019s wife is about to give birth. To replace him, Muguruza brought       Conchita Martinez.       Kismet? In 1994, Martinez, then 22 years old, knocked off a 37-year-old       Martina Navratilova       to win the Wimbledon final.The final against Williams was a microcosm of the tournament for Muguruza. In the fourth round, she lost the first set to the top-seeded       Angelique Kerber,        then outlasted the German 4-6, 6-4, 6-4 in one of the tightest, highest quality matches of the fortnight. After surviving that, she didn\u2019t drop a set.Now Muguruza will get the privilege of dancing with the men\u2019s champion at the tournament ball Sunday night. Two hours after she lifted the trophy, Muguruza was asked whether she would prefer to dance with       Roger Federer       or Marin Cilic, who compete Sunday afternoon.\u201cCome on,\u201d she pleaded, before relenting. \u201c      Roger...I       want to see if he has that elegance dancing.\u201dWrite to Matthew Futterman at matthew.futterman@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-15 13:08:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/garbine-muguruza-beats-venus-williams-to-win-wimbledon-1500129128", "news_title": "Garbi\u00f1e Muguruza Beats Venus Williams to Win Wimbledon", "keywords": "champion,garbine muguruza,sets,title,venus williams,venus williams wimbledon,wimbledon women's championship,Serena Williams,Venus Williams,Garbi\u00f1e Muguruza,dance sport,sports,tennis,routine general news"}, {"content": "Office leasing in central New Jersey picked up steam in the second quarter, as tenants seeking affordable prices and like-new renovated buildings signed deals, according to reports from real-estate brokerage firms.The region was a rare bright spot in the state\u2019s overall market, which continues to struggle with large blocks of empty office space.In all, central New Jersey notched 1.9 million square feet of leases signed, up 70% from the second quarter last year, according to real estate services firm Colliers International. Meanwhile, the amount of space leased in northern New Jersey fell to about 1 million square feet, a drop of more than 50% from the same period last year.Specific areas such as Monmouth County and along the Interstate 287 corridor played a key role, real-estate brokers and analysts said. Major overhauls of older buildings such as the Bell Works project in Holmdel, N.J., have continued to draw tenants and set an example for other landlords to invest in renovations, they said.Somerset Development LLC, the developer behind Bell Works, announced in April that it had signed a 90,000-square-foot lease deal with the Guardian Life Insurance Company of America and has signed smaller deals since then. The project has helped pull down the vacancy rate for upper-tier office space in the Monmouth market from almost 30% in the third quarter to about 22%, said Steve Jenco, director of suburban tri-state research for real estate services firm JLL.Central New Jersey office buildings were responsible for 90% of the 510,000 square feet of upper-tier office space absorbed in the entire northern and central markets combined, Mr. Jenco said.\u201cYou are going to see pockets of activity in suburban markets where landlords invest in buildings and put in amenities that tenants are looking for,\u201d Mr. Jenco said. \u201cThose are going to attract interest.\u201dSome smaller properties in the Monmouth market have undergone makeovers as well. Michael Abboud, chief executive of TetherView, a technology company providing cloud services, revamped the former army headquarters building in Fort Monmouth to establish a home for his growing company. The expense of Manhattan and the inconvenience of a long commute convinced Mr. Abboud to locate the offices close to his and his employees\u2019 homes.\u201cIt\u2019s not an efficient use of anyone\u2019s time to be commuting two hours in either direction,\u201d Mr. Abboud said.The percentage of vacant or soon-to-be-unoccupied office space also plummeted in places such as Piscataway, Somerset and Franklin Township on the Interstate 287 corridor, which historically have recorded some of the state\u2019s highest availability and vacancy rates, brokers and analysts said.Empty offices or space expected to become vacant in the next 12 months fell to 18% in that corridor, compared with about 26% two years ago, according to Colliers.Terumo Medical Corp. expanded its offices by about 59,000 square feet at 265 Davidson Ave. in Somerset where it signed a lease for 95,023 square feet. The company said it has seen a growth in its U.S. business and has been adding office space and staff, a Terumo spokeswoman said.Over the past few years, the combination of higher rents and decreasing available space in surrounding markets have pushed tenants to consider the Interstate 287 corridor, where rents for top-tier space are much lower, said John Obeid, a senior director at Colliers.Owners upgrading buildings in the Interstate 287 corridor also has helped that market, said Mark Russo, research manager at real estate services firm Newmark Knight Frank.\u201cThat market is the least expensive of central and northern New Jersey, but the other factor has been major upgrades by different landlords to their buildings,\u201d Mr. Russo said.In nearby Edison, American Equity Partners has invested between $2.5 million and $3 million to add a gym and a 5,000 square-foot cafeteria and lounge, make over the lobby, add new elevator cabs and make other improvements to its 248,000-square-foot building called Lincoln Place, said David Elkouby, an American Equity principal.With lease deals expected to close shortly, the building\u2019s occupancy will soon reach 70%, up from 25% in 2014 when the company bought it, Mr. Elkouby said.\u201cWe go into areas where the real estate is good but the property needs some improvements,\u201d he said. \u201cIn turn, we see a great result from the tenancy that comes to take a look at these buildings, when in the past they were irrelevant.\u201dWrite to Keiko Morris at Keiko.Morris@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-15 09:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-new-hot-office-market-central-new-jersey-1500123600", "news_title": "The New Hot Office Market: Central New Jersey?", "keywords": " central new jersey, jersey, new jersey, office leasing,office space,Colliers International,political,general news,real estate,property,real estate agents,brokers,real estate transactions,office real estate,commercial,industrial real estate,construction"}, {"content": "BEIJING\u2014President       Xi Jinping       announced the setup of a cabinet-level committee to coordinate China\u2019s financial regulation at a high-level meeting that ended\u00a0Saturday, as Beijing focuses on keeping risks at bay ahead of a twice-a-decade\u00a0leadership\u00a0shuffle later this year.At the two-day gathering that sought to establish a broad framework\u00a0to make China\u2019s regulatory system more cohesive, Mr. Xi said a new group, called the State Council Financial Stability and Development Committee, will be formed to make sure financial regulators can work better together. He said the central bank\u2019s role in preventing systemic risk will be strengthened, according to an official statement released at the conclusion of the meeting late\u00a0Saturday.No detail was given about the composition of the committee. According to people familiar with the matter, one option is for the group to be placed within the People\u2019s Bank of China and headed by its governor. Details are still being hammered out, the people said.\u201cBetter regulatory coordination means better information-sharing among different regulators,\u201d one of the people said. \u201cThe central bank, in particular, needs to gather comprehensive information from other regulators in a timely manner while forming the monetary policy and deciding on other courses of action.\u201dFor years, China\u2019s central bank and regulators overseeing the banking, securities and insurance industries have often acted in isolation and sometimes even at cross-purposes. That has led to missteps that exacerbated a stock selloff in the summer of 2015 and has raised doubts around Beijing\u2019s management of the economy.The plan laid out by Mr. Xi represents a much less radical version than previously envisioned by some officials and government advisers, who had urged centralizing oversight by putting all regulation under the PBOC. That proposal, according to Chinese officials, has met strong opposition from groups that could have been forced to cede power.It remains to be seen whether the new committee can make a difference. In the past few years, China\u00a0already had created\u00a0a so-called financial\u00a0coordination\u00a0mechanism that includes the chiefs from all the regulators. But that mechanism hasn\u2019t succeeded in improving coordination in any meaningful way,\u00a0according to\u00a0officials. \u201cPeople just got together once a month, mostly for lunch,\u201d an official with knowledge of the mechanism said.The two-day meeting, dubbed the National Financial Work Conference, is held every five years. Traditionally, it was presided over by the premier.

At a government-organized press conference, he thanked officials for their care of Mr. Liu, who succumbed to liver cancer under police guard on Thursday. He said that Mr. Liu\u2019s wife, Liu Xia, was \u201ctoo weak\u201d to appear.One of China\u2019s most prominent democracy activists, Mr. Liu was the first Nobel Peace Prize laureate to die in state custody since Carl von Ossietzky, who died in a prison hospital in Nazi Germany in 1938. Since Mr. Liu\u2019s death, the U.S. and other governments have called for Beijing to allow his wife and other relatives to travel overseas.China\u2019s Foreign Ministry dismissed the calls Friday as meddling in the country\u2019s internal affairs.Mr. Liu was cremated Saturday and his ashes scattered at sea, according to China\u2019s official Xinhua News Agency. The government has sought to erase Mr. Liu\u2019s legacy and mentions of his name have long been scrubbed from China\u2019s internet; the scattering of the ashes means he won\u2019t have a grave where supporters can gather.The government of the Chinese city Shenyang released photos Saturday of Ms. Liu and other family members at a closed-door funeral, an apparent effort to show the relatives are well treated.\u201cLiu Xia is free so far, and we want her to avoid trouble because she was in a grief,\u201d Xinhua quoted a Shenyang government spokesperson as saying.Activists and friends of Ms. Liu questioned the government account, saying they believe she remains under close watch, her movements restricted.\u201cNone of her close friends could reach her and her family,\u201d said Patrick Poon, a researcher at Amnesty International. \u201cIt is incomprehensible how her situation could be described as \u2018free.\u2019\u201dLiu Xiaoguang, the elder brother, praised the government multiple times at the press conference Saturday and said officials had followed all the family\u2019s wishes for funeral arrangements.\u201cThis has shown the advantages of the socialist system,\u201d said Liu Xiaoguang. \u201cI would like to express my heartfelt thanks to the party and government.\u201dActivists criticized his appearance as political theater, saying it was impossible to verify if there was coercion. Friends say they have been unable to contact Liu Xia and other relatives.Wu Yangwei, a family friend and writer known by the pen name Ye Du, said he has been unable to contact Ms. Liu in recent days.\u201cIf she is free, then what have these years of house arrest and monitoring been about?\u201d said Mr. Wu.Mr. Liu was sentenced to 11 years of jail in 2009 for his calls for China to adopt democracy. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize the next year, a decision that infuriated Beijing. His wife has been under house arrest since then, though she hasn\u2019t been charged with a crime.Following Mr. Liu\u2019s death Thursday from liver cancer, the U.S., European Union and other governments called for Beijing to allow Ms. Liu to travel overseas.\u201cWe again ask that China release Liu Xia from house arrest, and permit her and her family to travel as they wish,\u201d U.S. ambassador to China       Terry Branstad       said in a statement.China\u2019s Foreign Ministry said Friday whether Ms. Liu could travel overseas was an internal decision.\u201cIn regards to Liu Xia, China has always handled the entry and departure of Chinese citizens in accordance with law,\u201d spokesman Geng Shuang said at the ministry\u2019s regular press conference Friday. \u201cAs for whether Liu Xia can go overseas, I will not make prejudgments.\u201dSeparately, Xu Zhiyong, the founder of a loosely organized civic group called the New Citizens Movement, was released from prison Saturday morning after completing a four-year sentence for \u201cgathering crowds to disturb public order,\u201d according to his lawyer.\u201cI spoke with him on the phone and briefly caught him up with the situation outside prison,\u201d said the lawyer, Zhang Qingfang. \u201cHe\u2019s in decent spirits.\u201dMr. Zhang said it \u201cisn\u2019t very convenient\u201d for Mr. Xu to appear in public for now.

AAPL 0.63%       seems intent on repeating at least one bit of history from the original\u2014scrambling to get the device actually done.That, at least, is the upshot of numerous leaks and reports over the past month. Apple is reportedly working on at least one new iPhone model that will sport an entirely new design from the previous generation. The challenges posed by that design\u2014plus shortages of key components such as Organic Light Emitting Diode, or OLED, displays\u2014now appear likely to push the actual launch of the device later in the year. The most recent new iPhone models have begun shipping in mid-to-late September.This complicates Wall Street\u2019s hopes for a \u201csupercycle\u201d that would drive Apple\u2019s shares still higher. Another wrinkle is that the new design is widely expected to cost a lot more\u2014with a starting price rumored at more than $1,000. That is more in line with some of the company\u2019s MacBook computers, and it would make the new iPhone the most expensive phone ever in the U.S., according to       Cliff Maldonado       of BayStreet Research.Apple also appears to still be ironing out some key functions. The new phone is expected to feature an edge-to-edge OLED display similar to the Samsung Galaxy S8 that went on sale in April. This is becoming a popular way for smartphone makers to increase their display real estate without bloating the device\u2019s size farther. Counterpoint Research projects shipments of such OLED devices will hit 115 million this year and triple next year as OLED supply improves.But such a design also obviates the need for the traditional \u201chome\u201d button, where the iPhone has typically placed its TouchID fingerprint scanner. Apple is reportedly having trouble getting the scanner to work under the display glass on the new design. That may add to the production bottleneck.       Andy Hargreaves       of KeyBanc Capital says Apple will need to order the necessary chips for the feature by next month in order to manufacture enough devices ahead of the holidays.Wall Street has largely responded to the recent reports by taking the longer-term view. At least nine analysts over the past month have lowered their projected iPhone sales for the current fiscal year that ends in September. Most have shifted their forecasts into the next year. As a result, iPhone unit sales are expected to grow just 2% this year and 13% in fiscal 2018, according to FactSet.That means Apple\u2019s forecast for the September quarter\u2014expected when the company reports fiscal third-quarter results on Aug. 1\u2014may not fully reflect this year\u2019s iPhone launch. And longer term, it is unclear how such an expensive phone will be received. iPhones have typically been priced in line with other premium smartphones. But Apple\u2019s customers are famously loyal.             Goldman Sachs                   reported \u201csurprisingly little sensitivity\u201d to a $999 starting price in its recent survey of more than 1,000 consumers.That price wouldn\u2019t include incentives from carriers, which could offset the increase a bit. Still, Samsung\u2019s top-of-the-line Galaxy S8 starts at $725. Arriving late and expensive, the new iPhone may test more than just the loyalty of its most ardent fans.Write to Dan Gallagher at dan.gallagher@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-15 08:03:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-tests-the-faithful-1500120180", "news_title": "Apple Tests the Faithful", "keywords": " 10th anniversary, apple, apple iphone,consumer tech: smartphones wireless,heard, heard on the street, iphone,iphone display, iphone functions,iphone galaxy, iphone model, iphone sales, iphone shipments, oled,Apple,AAPL,political,general news,living,lifestyle,personal technology,commodity,financial market news,computers,consumer electronics,telecommunications equipment,mobile communications devices,personal electronics,cellular,mobile phones,handheld electronic devices,smartphones,technology"}, {"content": "For Mayor Bill de Blasio, going to Brooklyn most mornings is a way to get away from City Hall\u2019s political scene. But after four years of hitting the same cafe and gym, that scene has followed him over the bridge.Park Slope\u2019s Ninth Street between Fifth and Sixth avenues, where the mayor works out and grabs coffee, has transformed from a quiet block into a hub for power brokers, protesters and politically minded neighbors.Public-school activist Tish Doggett ran into Mr. de Blasio at neighborhood cafe Colson Patisserie last year and told him a letter to the city she co-wrote went unanswered. Just days later, mayoral aides set up a meeting.\u201cI said \u2018I don\u2019t want to bother you,\u2019\u201d she recalled, \u201cand he said, \u2018Oh, no, many an important meeting has taken place at Colson.\u2019\u201dThe mayor\u2019s mornings in Brooklyn typically include stops at the Belgian cafe for a yogurt parfait and espresso, according to people familiar with his routine, then on to the YMCA for a workout. Both are near the home Mr. de Blasio has owned since 2004, where he lived before moving to Gracie Mansion after his 2014 swearing in.This mayor isn\u2019t the first to have a hard time finding refuge from the job. Former Mayor Michael Bloomberg took weekend trips to his residence in Bermuda only to become a local celebrity on the island and gain scrutiny from journalists for his overseas travel.William Cunningham, a former aide to Mr. Bloomberg and to late Gov. Hugh Carey, said mayors will face scrutiny everywhere. He recalled that Mr. Carey, another Brooklynite, was careful not to disturb his neighbors during campaigns and discouraged aides from putting up posters near his Brooklyn home.\u201cIf you thought you could hide in New York City by creating a routine in a different neighborhood, you are mistaken,\u201d Mr. Cunningham said of Mr. de Blasio\u2019s trips to BrooklynThe mayor\u2019s office declined to comment about Mr. de Blasio\u2019s effect on the neighborhood, but the mayor has previously said being there keeps him \u201cgrounded.\u201dA few weeks back, Darren Mack, an activist seeking to meet with Mr. de Blasio to hasten the closure of jails on Rikers Island, interrupted the mayor\u2019s morning workout. He got a guest pass to the gym and started on the treadmill while awaiting the mayor\u2019s arrival. Then he confronted Mr. de Blasio on camera.In a video that went viral in political circles, Mr. de Blasio, stretching, largely ignores the activist.\u201cHe goes to the YMCA to be with other New Yorkers,\u201d said Mr. Mack. \u201cSo we thought that was an appropriate space to let him know our concerns.\u201dOther groups have used the YMCA as a place to stage demonstrations. Last year, the Patrolmen\u2019s Benevolent Association, the police union, protested there during union contract negotiations, with signs reading \u201cWorkout a contract!\u201d A rally for conserving the Elizabeth Street Garden was held there earlier this year.\u201cDe Blasio has made a point of going all the way to this gym in Park Slope,\u201d said Menashe Shapiro, a former campaign aide to Mr. Bloomberg and a New York political consultant who helped organize the demonstration for the garden outside the mayor\u2019s gym. \u201cNow it\u2019s as good a place to protest as City Hall.\u201dWhen the mayor eludes the City Hall press corps, they too know how to reach him. \u201cIt only makes sense to go where we can find him,\u201d said Grace Rauh, a television journalist with local station NY1. \u201cMost mornings that\u2019s at the gym.\u201dThe mayor has long defended the trips from Gracie Mansion to south Brooklyn from criticisms that they waste taxpayer time and money, saying they keep him close to his roots. He ran as a liberal insurgent in 2013 and often pointed to his Brooklyn background on the campaign trail.Locals largely shrug off his visits now. \u201cPeople are used to it,\u201d said Jade Henry, 19, who works at juice bar next to the YMCA.\u201cI don\u2019t pay him no mind,\u201d said Eddie Maettei, a 63-year old who lives on Ninth Street.As crowds gather, staffers at these establishments remain protective of the mayor. A gym worker who didn\u2019t want to give his name said: \u201cThe man just wants to swim.\u201dAndrew Hackel, a partner at Colson Patisserie, said he didn\u2019t know if business has been aided by the mayoral visits, but they have opened a new location during Mr. de Blasio\u2019s tenure.\u201cHe\u2019s a customer like everyone else,\u201d Mr. Hackel said.\u2014Mara Gay and Mariana Alfaro contributed to this article.Write to Mike Vilensky at mike.vilensky@dowjones.com", "news_time": "2017-07-15 08:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/de-blasios-morning-coffee-workout-rituals-draw-politics-to-brooklyn-block-1500120000", "news_title": "De Blasio\u2019s Morning Coffee, Workout Rituals Draw Politics to Brooklyn Block", "keywords": "bill de blasio, brooklyn,new york city, new york mayor, ninth street, park slope,political,general news,civil unrest,national,public security,physical fitness,health,living,lifestyle,politics,international relations,domestic politics,risk news"}, {"content": "Improving freight demand could signal brighter days ahead for transportation companies\u2014if they can persuade retailers and manufacturers to pay more for shipping.Trucking and logistics firms should give their outlooks for the rest of the year as they begin to report earnings next week, with investors watching for signs of a rebound from a two-year slump in freight rates.J.B. Hunt Transport Services Inc.,        JBHT -0.34%       one of the largest U.S. freight carriers, is expected to announce its second-quarter earnings Monday.             C.H. Robinson Worldwide Inc.,        CHRW -1.17%       the biggest freight brokerage, reports Thursday. Several large trucking companies report the following week.The results come as bountiful produce harvests and increased shipping demand tied to             Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s        AMZN 0.24%Prime Day sales promotion have helped boost rates on the spot truckload market, where companies book freight transportation on a daily basis. The average rate for dry vans, the most common type of tractor-trailer used to ship consumer goods, rose 11% in June compared with the same month last year, according to DAT Solutions LLC, an online freight marketplace.The recent lift has fueled hopes for a broader freight recovery, and transportation firms will be watching closely this month to see whether the upswing holds. Spot rates can be a leading indicator for contract rates, the long-term prices transportation firms negotiate with shippers. Big carriers do the majority of their business via contract, and those prices have remained stubbornly low even as freight volumes rose.\u201cJuly is the canary in the coal mine for the industry,\u201d said Cowen & Co. analyst Jason Seidl.Overcapacity in the truckload sector, where customers book entire trailers to carry their cargo, has weighed on trucking companies since late 2015. Fleets that expanded during a previous boom found themselves with too many trucks chasing a smaller pool of freight. The glut has also tamped down rates in the intermodal business of moving container cargo over long distances by rail and truck.At J.B. Hunt, the largest U.S. intermodal carrier, second-quarter earnings are expected to hold steady at $0.92 per share, according to a consensus of analysts via FactSet.\u201cMoving into 2018, you got to believe that at some point truckload rates may improve, even if just slightly,\u201d Darren Field, J.B. Hunt\u2019s senior vice president for the intermodal division, said at an industry conference last month. \u201cIt offers an opportunity for intermodal.\u201dOver the past 18 months large truckload operators have trimmed their fleets to reduce capacity and gain more leverage with shippers. Demand is also picking back up from manufacturers and retailers that cut back on shipping last year as they worked through excess inventory levels.Still, it could be months before improvements in the spot market translate into broader pricing gains for most carriers, which often negotiate freight contracts in the first half of the year.Rates may start to climb this year, and catch up in 2018, said       Dave Yeager,        chief executive of             Hub Group Inc.,       an intermodal and brokerage provider that expanded its trucking portfolio this year with the $306 million acquisition of Estenson Logistics, which provides dedicated trucking services for shippers that have outsourced their private fleet operations. \u201cIt does appear that pricing is headed upward, versus that horrific downward trend we saw for quite some time,\u201d Mr. Yeager said in an interview.The surging spot market could shrink profits for freight brokers, which use it to source most of their trucking capacity. Citi recently lowered its second-quarter and 2017 estimates for C.H. Robinson.Even as some truckload carriers report freight demand is picking back up, analysts expect earnings for their most recent quarters to lag behind compared with the same period in 2016 because contract rates remain low.Better results are forecast for less-than-truckload carriers, which consolidate small shipments into trailer loads for multiple customers and have benefited from the rise in online shopping. Last month             Old Dominion Freight Line Inc.,        ODFL -0.18%Saia Inc.        SAIA 0.87%       and             YRC Worldwide Inc.

But have you captured your home\u2019s flying bugs?Procter & Gamble Co.       wants to add a step to your cleaning routine. The consumer-product company, already known for Tide laundry detergent, Mr. Clean disinfectant and Swiffer mops, in April introduced Zevo, an indoor trap for winged insects including flies, mosquitoes, gnats and moths.After cleaning tubs, floors, clothes, hair and skin, bugs offer a new frontier, and a potential opportunity as P&G looks to reverse years of lackluster sales. \u201cAnother dirt for P&G are those insects around your home,\u201d says       Jane Welling,        a scientist for P&G\u2019s Ventures unit, which pursues new business opportunities.\u201cWhen flying insects come in, they seem to multiply and ruin everything that makes your house a home,\u201d an online Zevo ad says. \u201cIf you have pets and kids that are constantly going in and out of the house, then Zevo is a must-have.\u201dCreating new product categories is one way P&G is trying to turn around its business, which has struggled as consumers cut back spending and small, upstart brands have eaten into its dominance of shaving, cleaning and beauty products. Sales in P&G\u2019s most recent quarter ended March 31 fell 1% to $15.6 billion. Its fabric & home care division posted sales and profit declines over the same period.The strategy isn\u2019t new. P&G for generations has excelled at convincing consumers of problems they didn\u2019t realize they had. Febreze captures household odors you may have become accustomed to but guests might detect. Crest teaches consumers that teeth should be white, not just cavity-free. Pantene sells the notion that healthy hair should always shine. Olay wants aging consumers to fight dull skin tone as well as wrinkles. Downy says washing clothes also requires fiber protection, softening and fragrance.P&G is taking a relatively quiet approach to its Zevo launch. Unlike the blockbuster store roll outs P&G\u2019s giant brands usually stage for a new product, Zevo is sold via its folksy website and             Home Depot\u2019s       stores and site. The Zevo site includes photos of the P&G team that created the product, including a mosquito-masked employee named \u201cMosquito Joe,\u201d whose title is \u201cchief test subject.\u201d Zevo\u2019s packaging includes a thank-you note.Zevo, which resembles a plug-in air freshener, uses a combination of blue and UV light to attract flying insects onto a sticky cartridge that ensnares and ultimately kills them. Developers borrowed know-how from across P&G\u2019s businesses, including device technology from Febreze, adhesive capabilities from Always sanitary pads and the replaceable-cartridge business model from Gillette razors. A starter kit, which includes a device and two trap cartridges, costs $12.99 and two refill cartridges cost $5.99.P&G considered at least 50 iterations of the device as it looked for the right cover for the sticky cartridge\u2014it needed to have openings wide enough for insects to see the blue light and fly through it to be captured, yet not so revealing that consumers could see too many dead bugs. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want the consumers to get totally grossed out,\u201d Ms. Welling says.Still, seeing how many dead bugs are snagged during the cartridge\u2019s 45-day or so lifespan helps persuade consumers they need the device, P&G says. During a four-week test in Orlando, chosen because of its bug-friendly climate, consumers involved initially were skeptical they had a bug problem. \u201cBut then looking at their cartridge, they said, \u2018oh, I did need that,\u201d Ms. Welling says.P&G uses gruesome facts to describe why winged insects are more than just a household nuisance. Twice as many germs are carried by house flies than cockroaches and flies spit, throw up and defecate on food they land on, P&G says in its marketing materials. Some 1.6 million gallons of American blood is sucked by mosquitoes each year, and fruit flies can lay 500 eggs on your fruit in less than 10 days, P&G says.Still, except for mosquito-borne diseases like the West Nile and Zika viruses, flying insects don\u2019t usually pose a health hazard in the U.S., says       Joshua Benoit,        an entomologist and assistant professor of biology at the University of Cincinnati, who is involved in Zevo\u2019s development. \u201cFlies and other insects in your house in the U.S. are mostly just a major nuisance,\u201d he says.This summer homeowners may face a particularly annoying insect population thanks to a mild winter and warmer and wetter spring this year in many parts of the U.S. \u201cWe\u2019ll have a lot more pests,\u201d Dr. Benoit says.P&G says they aren\u2019t replacing the capabilities of an exterminator, but rather helping to alleviate an annoyance without chemicals or swatters. \u201cIf you\u2019re doing nothing before, now you\u2019re doing something,\u201d Ms. Welling says.Write to Ellen Byron at ellen.byron@wsj.comAppeared in the July 17, 2017, print edition as 'bugs, the New Frontier in Housecleaning.'", "news_time": "2017-07-15 07:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/bugs-the-new-frontier-in-housecleaning-1500116400", "news_title": "Bugs, the New Frontier in Housecleaning", "keywords": "bugs ,bug spray,house cleaning,house flies,Procter & Gamble,PG,political,general news,living,lifestyle,cosmetics,toiletries,consumer goods,personal care products,appliances"}, {"content": "CARACAS\u2014To young Venezuelan activists imprisoned by the government, Lisbeth A\u00f1ez was a saint, delivering food, clothing and medicine while they were detained at a notorious prison run by the spy agency.Now, the 51-year-old known as \u201cMam\u00e1 Lis\u201d is also jailed there, charged in May by a military court with treason and rebellion, say her lawyers and relatives.\u201cI\u2019m not alone,\u201d Ms. A\u00f1ez wrote in a letter she recently released to relatives and supporters. \u201cThe love of Venezuela, together with God, accompany me.\u201dWhile the recent transfer of opposition leader Leopoldo L\u00f3pez from a military stockade to house arrest has received world-wide attention, Venezuela\u2019s jails now hold more political prisoners than at any time in 18 years of rule by the self-declared leftist Bolivarian Revolution, say human rights groups.The trend harks back to an era in Latin America when dictatorships from Nicaragua to Argentina jailed thousands of dissidents. With the exception of Cuba, the spread of democracy since the 1980s changed all that, but now Venezuela\u2019s government has revived the practice, rights groups say.Foro Penal, a Caracas group whose lawyers represent many detainees, counts about 440 political prisoners, up from 117 before large antigovernment demonstrations began on April 1. Many recent detainees\u2014including university students, professors and a prominent electoral expert\u2014face the threat of years in prison, their lawyers and relatives say.In all, 3,500 people have been detained since the protests began, most for short periods, more people even than when Venezuela was shaken by sustained street unrest, in 2014. Most aren\u2019t charged; others face charges ranging from treason to inciting violence.\u201cWe\u2019ve never seen this rate of detentions before,\u201d said Nizar El Fakih, a lawyer who leads the rights group Proiuris.Calls and emails to government officials weren\u2019t returned. President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and other top officials deny the existence of political prisoners in Venezuela and describe demonstrators as \u201cterrorists\u201d and part of a conspiracy to topple the state.Mr. Maduro\u2019s crackdown has recently taken a more sinister turn with his government\u2019s use of military tribunals to try civilians critical of his administration, say activists, opposition members and families of detainees. The policy has gathered momentum since the attorney general broke with Mr. Maduro\u2019s administration and voiced concerns over prisoners of conscience.Prisoners are regularly denied access to lawyers and their relatives, these people say. Defense attorneys say they often don\u2019t know when hearings have been scheduled, until last-minute notifications are issued. When lawyers arrive at court\u2014often improvised tribunals at a military facility\u2014they are given only a few minutes to confer with their clients.\u201cThis is systematic persecution,\u201d said Lilia Camejo, a lawyer for several prisoners.Opposition politician Wilmer Azuaje, who was detained by intelligence agents, according to Human Rights Watch, after alleging corruption among government officials, has been held without access to his family and lawyers, said Kelly Garcia, his wife.

He was shuttled between jails for four months.\u201cI would not see sunlight on a regular basis,\u201d he said. \u201cI was basically in a feces-infested dungeon. That was my cell.\u201d After his release last year, Mr. Marquez fled Venezuela and now lives in Washington.Others who were briefly held, like Argenis Agueto, a 27-year-old university student, said their jailers used the threat of long prison terms to scare them away from antigovernment politics. Mr. Agueto said the National Guard detained him and five friends on their way to protests in April. He said Molotov cocktails, knives and rocks were planted in their knapsacks and that they were beaten when they denied owning them.\u201cThey said that we would be imprisoned for 10 years, 20 years,\u201d said Mr. Agueto, who was released in a month but must report his whereabouts regularly.Pressure to release prisoners has come from the streets, where protests continue, and from foreign capitals, including Washington, calling on Mr. Maduro to open the jail cells.The country\u2019s most prominent prisoner, Mr. L\u00f3pez, who leads the Popular Will party, was transferred home came after mediators led by former Spanish Prime Minister       Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez       Zapatero met with top Maduro aides.Mr. L\u00f3pez received the attention of U.S. President       Donald Trump       after his wife, Lilian Tintori, went on a global tour to condemn Mr. Maduro\u2019s government. Others, however, like Ms. A\u00f1ez, are barely known outside of Venezuela.The imprisoned activist has hepatitis and back problems and hasn\u2019t received any treatment while in jail, said her son, Luis Fernando Gonz\u00e1lez. But Mr. L\u00f3pez\u2019s release has given her some hope, her son said.\u201cShe thinks this can have an effect on the rest of the political prisoners,\u201d he said.\u2014       Kejal Vyas       in Bogot\u00e1 contributed to this article.Write to Ryan Dube at ryan.dube@dowjones.comAppeared in the July 17, 2017, print edition as 'Venezuela Detentions Recall Earlier Era.'", "news_time": "2017-07-15 07:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/in-venezuela-a-latin-american-throwback-political-prisoners-1500116402", "news_title": "In Venezuela, a Latin American Throwback: Political Prisoners", "keywords": "venezuela and crisis, venezuela and lopez, venezuela and oil, venezuela and opposition, venezuel and food shortage, venezuel and prisoners,political,general news,crime,legal action,politics,international relations,domestic politics"}, {"content": "SAN FRANCISCO\u2014California lawmakers are considering $3 billion worth of rebates for buyers of electric cars in an effort to power an industry that relies heavily on public subsidies.The bill has passed the state Assembly, and is advancing in the state Senate, which is expected to take up the bill once it clears a final committee next month. Gov. Jerry Brown has set ambitious goals for zero-emissions vehicles; he hasn\u2019t said whether he would sign this bill.California has long been a leader on environmental, clean air and climate policies with its large size, geography and heavy reliance on the automobile. The state already has more than 250,000 zero emission vehicles on its roads, including electric cars, accounting for about half the U.S. market, according to the California Air Resources Board.Similar incentives helped boost electric car sales elsewhere.A $5,000 tax credit in Georgia helped the state become the second-largest electric vehicles market in the U.S. after California until the state tax credit was eliminated in July 2015, according to Edmunds, a website that tracks automotive sales. After the change, sales in Georgia fell to 2% of all U.S. electric vehicles sold in 2016 from 17% in 2014, according to the site. Georgia sales of Tesla, luxury electric vehicles that typically sell for about $100,000, initially fell but bounced back, according to Edmunds.Electric cars remain more expensive than those that run on gasoline, making sales challenging when gas prices are low.Auto executives talk about an impending \u201ctipping point\u201d when the costs of some electric car models are expected to fall below the cost of the conventional version of the same vehicle type. Industry analysts estimate that rising costs of developing combustion engines that meet ever-stricter emissions regulations could make some electric models more affordable as soon as 2025.In California, electric cars made up just 2.7% of the new car market in the first quarter of 2017, according to a report by the California New Dealers Association. During the first three months of 2017, the Honda Civic was the most popular selling new model in the state.But to meet aggressive mandates for statewide reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, California aims to build 1.5 million zero-emissions vehicles by 2025 and five million by 2030. The electric car industry needs an \u201caggressive boost\u201d to get there, said Assemblyman Phil Ting, a San Francisco Democrat who wrote the bill authorizing the rebates.\u201cWe have pushed and adopted very aggressive climate change policies,\u201d Mr. Ting said. \u201cThere is no way we are going to get there if we don\u2019t put more clean vehicles, or clean cars, on the road.\u201dCalifornia has had a tax rebate of $2,500 on full electric vehicles since 2010 but the program was scaled back this summer to customers based on income eligibility as the program awaits funding from the state, according to Chuck Colgan, a spokesman at the Center for Sustainable Energy.Funds for the proposed rebate will come from existing programs, Mr. Ting said, with one source being the state\u2019s cap-and-trade program, which requires industry in California to pay for greenhouse gas emissions. That program faces a key test on Monday, with state lawmakers having scheduled a vote on whether to extend the program from 2020 through 2030.Some cap and trade revenue helps fund the existing, limited electric car rebate program, in which a buyer has to apply for a rebate after purchasing a car. Mr. Ting\u2019s bill would create a program that offers buyers rebates at dealerships, and bigger discounts for lower-income buyers.The rebate bill isn\u2019t without critics, who say the program would be a giveaway to an industry that has struggled to survive without public funding.\u201cThe legislature is once again picking winners and losers in what is supposed to be a free-market,\u201d said state Senator Andy Vidak, a Republican from Hanford, Calif.Jessica Caldwell, an auto industry analyst for Edmunds, said a new California program should boost sales, particularly given that new electric car models such as the Chevrolet Bolt and Tesla Model 3 can go further distances, making them accessible for more consumers.\u201cIn major cities like San Francisco and Los Angeles, the infrastructure is growing, which has been a major barrier for widespread adoption,\u201d she said. \u201cOne can argue whether or not this proposal is an efficient use of state funds but if California politicians decide that, yes, increased EV ownership is a priority for the state, then providing more incentives is surely a way to achieve this goal.\u201dWrite to Tim Higgins at Tim.Higgins@WSJ.com", "news_time": "2017-07-15 07:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/california-pushes-new-incentives-for-zero-emissions-vehicles-1500116400", "news_title": "California Considers a $3 Billion Electric-Car Push", "keywords": "greenhouse gas emissions,California Air Resources Board,economic performance,indicators,car registrations,vehicle sales,government finance,government budget,taxation,economic news,political,general news,climate change,natural environment,global,world issues,motor vehicles,alternative fuel vehicles,automotive"}, {"content": "What does a 10-year-old have in common with a pro boxer? Both jump rope with ease, says       Grant Opperman.       \u201cBoxers, some of the fittest athletes in the world, work cardio, reflexes and coordination by performing an activity most of us did as children,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd even though it\u2019s grueling, there\u2019s also something really fun about jumping rope.\u201dMr. Opperman, the 52-year-old founder of the Microburst Group, a Bay Area communications and strategy consultancy, began his search for a sustainable workout in 1996. \u201cI was 31 years old then, so I wasn\u2019t feeling the effects of an unhealthy lifestyle, but in the span of a few years my pants size went from a 32 to a 34,\u201d he says.Having climbed to 187 pounds despite being just 5-foot-9, he was scared into a gym membership after an instructor in a yoga class warned him he was on the road to heart disease. Even with regular, hourlong sessions of cardio and weights, he didn\u2019t feel any fitter. \u201cI blamed it on my metabolism slowing with age,\u201d he says.In 2014, his wife told him to stop making excuses and join her at boot camp. The couple took the burpee exercise, their least favorite in class, and turned it into an at-home challenge. \u201cWe tried to do 100 burpees a day for one month,\u201d he says. \u201cYou get addicted to improving, and soon I was doing 150 or 200, and by the last day I did 400 burpees,\u201d he says.He began to take other exercises from class\u2014pull-ups, push-ups\u2014and turn them into monthly challenges. Last year he took on jump rope. \u201cThere was nothing enjoyable about burpees,\u201d he says. \u201cBut with jump rope, I was constantly amusing myself by trying new tricks.\u201dMr. Opperman found inspiration on the Zen Dude Fitness YouTube channel. \u201cIt\u2019s two young guys with six packs who created the ultimate jump-rope tutorial,\u201d he says. \u201cThey convinced me that if I just kept up with it, I could become good.\u201dThe combination of jump rope and boot camp has helped Mr. Opperman drop to 155 pounds. \u201cI have a leaner, stronger build than I ever believed possible,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m still not a master of jump rope, but I love that there\u2019s always a new move to learn.\u201dSix days a week Mr. Opperman rises at 4:45 a.m. He starts the day by jumping rope for 15 minutes. He uses a light rope for fancy footwork like side swipes, boxer skips and double unders, which require him to jump higher and spin the rope faster so that it passes twice before he touches the ground. He uses a heavier rope for endurance and strength.\u201cYou have no idea the pain that you can achieve jumping rope until you\u2019ve jumped for a minute with a 1-pound rope,\u201d he says. \u201cIt works the arms, chest and back muscles.\u201d Some days he does a circuit, performing one minute of basic bounce jumping, followed by a 30-second rest, one minute of mountain climbers, and a 30-second rest, then one minute of push-ups.At home, he jumps in his garage or in his backyard. On the road he jumps in the hotel gym or parking lot. \u201cI\u2019ve even jumped in front of the LAX airport,\u201d he says.After his jump-rope routine, he drives to Fit Body Boot Camp near his home in Dublin, Calif., for a 6:30 a.m. circuit class for 30 minutes. After boot camp he does 50 burpees.Mr. Opperman eats an energy bar pre-workout and drinks a protein shake after boot camp. He makes lunch at home, usually some variation of saut\u00e9ed spinach, peppers, broccoli and sweet potato mixed with black beans, two eggs and sometimes brown rice.\u201cAs I\u2019ve gotten older, my body doesn\u2019t process carbs as well, so I\u2019ve cut back,\u201d he says. If he\u2019s eating out, he\u2019ll order a burger in a lettuce wrap or a bowl at Chipotle rather than a burrito. His wife might make steak or chicken with roasted vegetables for dinner. \u201cChocolate and ice cream are problems in my life,\u201d he says. \u201cParticularly when I\u2019m stressed or tired.\u201dMr. Opperman initially resisted buying a good jump rope. \u201cIn my mind, a jump rope should cost $5, not $50,\u201d he says. \u201cBut like any other piece of athletic equipment, you pay for quality. Half the reason people can\u2019t jump rope is because 90% of jump ropes are miserable.\u201d He purchased a Crossrope starter set, which includes a \u00bc-pound agility rope and a 1-pound intensity rope.He wears             Under Armour                   Micro G Optimum sneakers, which are lightweight but cushioned for support. He bought his for $59 on Amazon. He says the minimalist nature of Inov-8 Bare-XF 210 sneakers (retail $110) are great for working on footwork. He pays $150 a month for his boot-camp membership.\u201cWhen you jump rope, it\u2019s not about what music you like or don\u2019t like, it\u2019s about the rhythm,\u201d he says. \u201cSome of the best music to jump to is from singers who are also dancers, like       Justin Timberlake,       Michael Jackson       or       Usher.      \u201dIn the eyes of Chris Vlaun, co-founder of V Art of Wellness in Park City, Utah and Miami, more people should think back to their childhood phys-ed classes. \u201cA lot of what we did as children translates to a great workout, and it\u2019s a lot more fun than a typical gym workout,\u201d he says.Jump rope works our cardiovascular system, fast-twitch muscles, core stability and our motor and brain function. \u201cIt\u2019s also meditative,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you lose focus, you trip on the rope.\u201d If jump rope is intimidating, he suggests starting with jumping jacks. \u201cIf you think about the tempo you jog at and how frequently your feet strike the ground, jumping jacks probably double that,\u201d he says. \u201cI tell clients that if they can do 300 jumping jacks nonstop, then they can run a 5K, no problem.\u201dMr. Vlaun suggests mixing up the footwork and adding in split jacks, where the feet scissor instead of extend laterally. He says playing tag with friends or your children is like an interval workout. Relay races are also a fun way to incorporate high-intensity intervals into your routine, he says.Jessica Graham, assistant director of fitness at the University of Oregon, says games like hopscotch also make great warm-up exercises. \u201cTry jumping both feet into each box, then jump single legged and then go for time,\u201d she says.Write to Jen Murphy at workout@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-15 07:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-joy-of-the-jump-rope-1500116401", "news_title": "The Joy of the Jump Rope", "keywords": "boot camp, boxer skips,burpees, double unders,fitness,jumping rope,jumprope,jump rope,more on fitness,side swipes,weight loss,what's your workout,Grant Opperman,political,general news,physical fitness,health,living,lifestyle"}, {"content": "Chadds Ford, Pa.Is it OK to like       Andrew Wyeth       again?One of the country\u2019s most respected artists for most of his life, the first living American painter to have a retrospective at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, he became a victim of his own mass acclaim. The critical backlash against his so-called Helga series\u2014\u201csecret\u201d nudes of his young blond and buxom neighbor that were disclosed in 1986-87 and inflated by lucrative media hype\u2014severely marred his reputation. It never recovered.Andrew Wyeth: In RetrospectBrandywine River Museum of Art  Through Sept. 17Since his death in 2009, his precisionist vision of rural America has seemed increasingly outmoded. Unlike his older friend       Edward Hopper,        he is not exalted as a prophet of film noir and contemporary unease. Sophisticates continue to dismiss Wyeth as a regional nostalgist.On the centenary of his birth, the Brandywine River Museum of Art has opened \u201cAndrew Wyeth: In Retrospect,\u201d a tightly edited exhibition (with catalog from Yale University Press) that seeks to present new facets of the artist. The co-curators,       Patricia Junker       from the Seattle Art Museum (the show\u2019s next and final venue) and       Audrey Lewis       from the BRMA, view Wyeth as a death-haunted magical realist, whose portrayal of his stark surroundings in Chadds Ford, Pa., and the islands of Maine was more mythic than documentary.Wyeth\u2019s obsession with World War I is one surprising theme of the show. Not only did he collect military miniatures from the period and portray aging men in their old uniforms (U.S. and German), he also developed an unhealthy enthusiasm for the 1925 silent film antiwar epic, \u201cThe Big Parade.\u201dAccording to the art historian       Henry Adams,        Wyeth bought a print of the epic, which runs almost 2\u00bd hours, and watched it an estimated 500 times. Directed by King Vidor, the melodrama unfolds against the realities of war; the hero becomes an amputee. Mr. Adams argues that elements of the film were incorporated into some of the most celebrated of Wyeth\u2019s post-World War II paintings, including \u201cWinter 1946\u201d (1946) and \u201cChristina\u2019s World\u201d (1948).To supplement the familiar meticulousness of his works in tempera, the curators also highlight ones done with a looser brush: the watercolors \u201cClump of Mussels\u201d (1939) and \u201cWolf Moon\u201d (1975), along with late works in tempera, such as \u201cSparks\u201d (2001), in which a cavernous fireplace spits out smears of smoke and ash.Finally, the circle of people in Wyeth\u2019s oeuvre is revealed to be wider than previously thought. On both floors of the show are more than a dozen portraits of African-Americans, along with paintings and drawings of the places where they lived and worshipped.The revision is persuasive and expands the borders of the artist\u2019s psychological concerns. The absence in the show of \u201cChristina\u2019s World,\u201d \u201cTenant Farmer,\u201d \u201cFaraway,\u201d \u201cCorner of the Woods\u201d and other favorites does not lessen the impact or quality of what\u2019s here.Wyeth\u2019s is a completely believable and self-contained world, one governed by a harsh and lonely code of self-sufficiency. Only single farms and houses are visible in his mostly treeless landscapes. There is no community. Nor do we see families, either\u2014only portraits of solitary individuals.He did not ignore the heavy toll paid by his characters\u2014women, above all\u2014for scratching out a life in these climates. In the drybrush watercolor \u201cThe Kuerners\u201d (1971), the only picture here of a couple, the rifle that hangs from the husband\u2019s shoulder is aimed at his wife\u2019s heart. (Wyeth often brings to mind       Robert Frost       at his bleakest, as in his poem \u201cThe Death of the Hired Man.\u201d)Like       Ansel Adams,        Wyeth chose to keep modernity from intruding on his frames. The one mechanical vehicle depicted in the show is a pickup truck at the scene of a farm foreclosure (\u201cPublic Sale,\u201d 1943). Electricity is in short supply. The sources of illumination in his paintings are usually sunlight or kerosene lamps. Stoves burn wood.What invigorates Wyeth\u2018s fossilized aesthetic is his undeniable skill as a draftsman and painter. The panoramic \u201cHoffman\u2019s Slough\u201d (1947) is a masterwork that should be more famous. Rendered in deep shadow, with mottled reds among the browns and greens, the valley still holds slivers of water in its hollows. The sentimental grip of a place where the artist skated as a child is conveyed in a design that is as abstract as it is realistic. It could almost be a Clifford Still.Wyeth\u2019s standing has suffered from his position apart from both pure abstraction and Pop. MoMA, for example, doesn\u2019t know what to do with \u201cChristina\u2019s World\u201d and has stuck it in a corridor by the escalators. Among contemporary art stars, only       James Welling       has been brave enough to cite Wyeth as an early inspiration. His 2010-12 series of photographs in the landscapes of Chadds Ford and Maine is an unironic homage.If       Norman Rockwell       can be rehabilitated for today\u2019s art world, Wyeth can be, too. He was a more complicated and blood-stirring artist than his detractors have led us to believe.\u2014Mr. Woodward is an arts critic in New York.", "news_time": "2017-07-15 07:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/andrew-wyeth-in-retrospect-review-reassessing-a-mythic-painter-1500116406", "news_title": "\u2018Andrew Wyeth: In Retrospect\u2019 Review: Reassessing a Mythic Painter", "keywords": "andrew wyeth, art review,arts in review, brandywine river museum of art, in retrospect, painting,Andrew Wyeth,art,political,general news,arts,entertainment,reviews"}, {"content": "A national craving for bacon is pushing U.S. pork-belly prices to record highs.Prices for the part of a hog used to make bacon have risen around 80% this year, while frozen reserves are at a six-decade low. Americans bought around 14% more bacon at stores in 2016 than in 2013, according to market-research firm Nielsen.\u201cThe consumer has simply woken up to the joy of having bacon on more and more things,\u201d said       Arlan Suderman,        chief commodities economist at INTL FCStone in Kansas City, Mo.Once considered a more unhealthy byproduct of a hog compared with prized cuts like pork chops and tenderloin, bacon has become a guilty pleasure amid a broader embrace of fatty meats. In the past decade, bacon has popped up on menus far from BLT\u2019s and breakfast specials. The craze has gained pace this year.Fast-food chain Arby\u2019s Inc. last month introduced a series of \u201ctriple thick\u201d bacon sandwiches. Brooklyn-based eatery Landhaus serves maple bacon on a stick. And bacon-themed summer festivals have sprung up in cities across the country.\u201cEverybody and their mother is coming out with a new bacon sandwich,\u201d said       Dan Norcini,        a livestock trader in Coeur d\u2019Alene, Idaho.Appetite for beef and bacon typically swells ahead of a July 4 and Memorial Day grilling boost. Wholesale beef prices followed that seasonal trajectory this year, falling from a mid-June peak.Some analysts say bacon, meanwhile, is becoming a yearlong staple that consumers are eager to procure. That voracious demand has left wholesalers in a squeeze. Retailers \u201chave turned hand-to-mouth, buying only what they need, waiting for production to increase and prices to decline,\u201d said       Dennis Smith,        a commodities broker at Archer Financial Services in Chicago.Pig farmers are struggling to keep up with demand. The national hog herd rose to a seasonal record of 71.7 million head in early June, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, up 3% from a year earlier.But it hasn\u2019t been enough to satiate bacon demand. Stocks of pork bellies in commercial freezers fell to 31.6 million pounds in May, down 59% from a year earlier and the lowest figure for the month since the USDA began keeping track in the 1950s.The crunch pushed the price for a pound of wholesale pork belly to $2.10 this week, the highest since the USDA began regularly tracking the market in 2013. Analysts say prices are also at a record high compared with those reported voluntarily before then. Lean hog futures at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange hit a 2\u00bd-year high in early July.High prices in the past have led some retailers and restaurants to slice bacon more thinly or promote alternatives like sausage, said Altin Kalo, an economist at the Steiner Consulting Group, which advises food companies.\u201cThere\u2019s a point where it gets to be too expensive,\u201d he said.Write to Benjamin Parkin at Benjamin.Parkin@wsj.comAppeared in the July 17, 2017, print edition as 'Bacon Craze Pushes Up Prices.'", "news_time": "2017-07-15 07:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/americas-lust-for-bacon-is-pushing-pork-belly-prices-to-records-1500116405", "news_title": "America\u2019s Lust for Bacon Is Pushing Pork Belly Prices to Records", "keywords": "bacon,bacon craze,lean hog futures ,pork belly,price of bacon,Arby's,Archer Financial Services,Chicago Mercantile Exchange,CME,Steiner Consulting Group,Arlan Suderman,Dan Norcini,Dennis Smith,political,general news,food,drink,living,lifestyle,politics,international relations,domestic politics,agriculture department,government bodies,executive branch,commodity markets,agricultural commodity markets,commodity,financial market news,hogs,pigs markets,livestock,meat markets,agriculture,farming,hog,pig farming,beverages,tobacco,wholesalers,retail,wholesale,food retailing,specialty stores,agricultural raw material wholesale,consumer goods,food products,livestock farming"}, {"content": "Former Google employee Deven Desai said part of his job at the company was to compile a list of \u201call the major policy academics in intellectual property so\u201d Google lobbyists could know whom to follow and potentially target for papers.
