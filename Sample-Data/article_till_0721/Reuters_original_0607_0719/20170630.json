Mookie Betts and Hanley Ramirez might be, too. Betts and Ramirez each blasted solo home runs, and Price tossed seven quality innings as the Boston Red Sox came from three runs down to beat the Minnesota Twins 6-3 on Thursday night at Fenway Park. Betts hit his team-leading 13th homer of the season and finished with two RBIs on the night. Ramirez collected his 11th home run.  Just went up there and tried to put a good swing on a good pitch,  Betts said.  I was able to put a couple in play for a couple of RBIs, but we had a great offensive night all around.  Betts has been off his American League MVP runner-up pace from one year ago, hitting .272 coming into the night -- which is low by his standards.  Still got to be a little more consistent,  he said.  It's just trying to take one game at a time and effect the game somehow, someway offensively.  Ramirez, meanwhile, has battled injuries and inconsistency at the plate this season. Related CoveragePreview: Twins at Red SoxMinnesota Twins - PlayerWatchBoston Red Sox - PlayerWatchDespite going deep in his first game back after missing three games with left knee soreness, Ramirez is batting just .242, and his 30 RBIs rank sixth on the team. His teammates are not worried yet, though.  He's huge in the middle of the lineup. We're going to need him,  Betts said of Ramirez.  He'll be there when we need him. I'm positive for that.  Price (3-2) allowed three runs on six hits and no walks with seven strikeouts. It was the former American League Cy Young Award winner's second consecutive quality start. He has allowed three or fewer runs in each of his past four starts and six of seven overall after beginning the season on the disabled list.  The last two (starts) have been the best so far,  Red Sox manager John Farrell said.  I think it's pretty natural that you get six, seven starts under your belt, arm strength continues to improve.  Craig Kimbrel struck out two in the ninth to notch his American League-leading 22nd save. He earned his 30th consecutive save at Fenway Park, a venue record. Deven Marrero also had two RBIs, and Jackie Bradley Jr. had three hits and an RBI for Boston (44-35), which won three of four games in the series against Minnesota (40-37) and capped a 4-3 homestand. Jorge Polanco drove in two runs and Joe Mauer had an RBI as the Twins dropped to 4-3 on their 11-game road trip.  It's not a park you get overly comfortable with at any particular point,  Twins manager Paul Molitor said of Fenway.  But it did have a good start to the game. (Minnesota starter Kyle Gibson) was efficient early.  Gibson (4-6) surrendered five runs (three earned) on six hits and a walk while striking out just two in 5 2/3 innings.  Really in the fourth inning I just threw Betts a pitch that he's hit out on me before,  Gibson said.  Other than the 3-0 pitch to Hanley, I thought I felt pretty good and just ran into some bad luck there.  Ramirez gave the Red Sox a 5-3 lead with his monster homer to straightaway center field in the sixth, a shot that traveled approximately 427 feet. Marrero's RBI double an inning later made it a three-run game. Boston scored three runs in the fifth inning to grab a 4-3 lead. Bradley's RBI double and Marrero's groundout tied the game at 3 before Betts singled in the go-ahead run with two outs. Betts put the Red Sox on the board an inning earlier with his estimated 398-foot home run over the Green Monster. Mauer's first-inning groundout plated Minnesota's first run. Polanco gave the Twins an early three-run advantage with a two-run double in the fourth. NOTES: Boston 2B Dustin Pedroia sat to rest his surgically repaired left knee.  Thought it was best to give him a day to try and stay ahead of things,  manager John Farrell said. ... Minnesota 3B Miguel Sano will participate in the Home Run Derby on July 10 in Miami. Sano's 18 homers lead the Twins and ranks among the AL leaders.  You're never sure if you're going to get another (opportunity). You might as well take advantage,  manager Paul Molitor said. ... Twins SS Nick Gordon and Red Sox 3B Rafael Devers will play in the All-Star Futures Game on July 9. ...

ZTE said it would invest 2 billion yuan ($295.5 million) in 5G research and development every year starting this year, up from 1 billion yuan invested last year. The budget could rise further as China aims to roll out 5G by 2020, the company said.

On Thursday night, a day after losing starter Chase Anderson to an oblique strain, the Brewers needed innings out of their starter to rest the bullpen and a few runs. They got that, and more. Milwaukee homered six times, including a pair of solo shots by Jonathan Villar and a three-run shot by Jesus Aguilar, in an 11-3 victory over the Cincinnati Reds in the finale of a three-game series at Great American Ball Park. Ryan Braun, Manny Pina and Domingo Santana also went deep for the Brewers (42-39), who avoided the sweep and improved to 7-3 against the Reds this season.  (Wednesday) was a tough game in a lot of ways,  Counsell said.  We keep bouncing back from those tough games. We came back tonight to get the last game of the series in a big way.  Aguilar went 3-for-5 with a homer, a double and four RBIs, helping Milwaukee remain in sole possession of first place in the National League Central for the 40th day. It was the sixth time in Brewers history that they homered six or more times in a game, the first time since 2007, when they also did it against Cincinnati. Related CoveragePreview: Brewers at RedsMilwaukee Brewers - PlayerWatchCincinnati Reds - PlayerWatchThe homers provided more than enough run support for right-hander Jimmy Nelson, who allowed only three hits and two runs in seven innings. Nelson (6-4) walked one and tied a career high with 11 strikeouts.  You don't want to put too much pressure on yourself to go deep in a game, but I wanted to help the bullpen,  Nelson said.  (Losing Anderson) is big for sure. We just have to step up as a rotation.  Joey Votto homered twice and Adam Duvall doubled twice for Cincinnati (33-45). Votto has 23 home runs this season, one behind the Dodgers' Cody Bellinger for the NL lead. Right-hander Homer Bailey (0-2) made his second start since coming off the disabled list on Saturday. And, unfortunately for the Reds, the results were much the same. On Saturday, Bailey allowed eight runs in 1 2/3 innings of an 18-3 loss at Washington. On Thursday, he was charged with six runs in three innings.  He's getting his sea legs under him,  said Reds manager Bryan Price, who was ejected in the third inning.  It's been the better part of three years since he's pitched at this level. His stuff is OK. I got to watch from the office. His location isn't good. This would be his early-season starts. He's a better pitcher than that.  Bailey was a strike away from retiring the Brewers in order in the first inning, but Braun hit Bailey's 1-2 pitch off the left field foul pole to put Milwaukee ahead 1-0. Pina belted his sixth homer to right-center with one out in the second to make the score 2-0. Villar's seventh homer made it a three-run lead.  The action on the pitches was there,  Bailey said.  The velocity was there. I'm getting back to the speed of the game. I have to be a little bit sharper.  Hernan Perez doubled home the Brewers' fourth run in the third inning. The ball got lodged at the base of the wall, and Price asked for replay review to determine if it was a ground-rule double, which would have sent the runner back to third. The call stood, and Price argued the decision with plate umpire Fieldin Culbreth. Price was ejected for the second time this season. The whole sequence was made moot when Milwaukee erupted for four runs in the fourth inning off right-hander Kevin Shackelford, who was making his major league debut. Villar, making his first start since coming off the disabled list on Tuesday, homered for the second consecutive at-bat, and Aguilar's three-run shot made the score 10-0.  I'm just waiting for my turn,  Villar said.  Whether I'm starting or coming in the middle of the game, I'll be ready.  Nelson held Cincinnati hitless until Votto's solo home run with one out in the fourth. Thursday was Votto's 13th career multi-homer game, first this season.  You knew we were going to bust out of it, especially in a park like this,  Nelson said. NOTES: Milwaukee placed RHP Chase Anderson on the 10-day disabled list with a left quad strain. Anderson left the Wednesday game in the first inning after injuring himself while batting. ... Brewers RHP Jorge Lopez was recalled from Double-A Biloxi prior to the Thursday game, and he allowed a run and four hits over two innings of relief. ...

Earlier this week, the government relaxed curbs on foreign investment, removing 30 entries from a list to allow more access into its services, manufacturing and mining sectors. Beijing, left 63 items restricted, or off-limits to foreign investment.  This year China's foreign investment has seen negative growth, this is something we need to closely monitor,  Li said, in comments carried on the website of China's cabinet, known as the State Council.  We must eliminate barriers to investment and increase the confidence of both domestic and foreign investors.  It takes longer for foreign firms to register and the time taken for goods to pass through customs is much slower versus global standards, Li added, acknowledging this had to change.  China's foreign direct investment in May fell 3.7 percent from a year earlier to 54.67 billion yuan. While China's economy grew slightly faster than expected in the first quarter, many analysts expect it to lose steam later in the year as the impact of earlier stimulus measures starts to fade and as local authorities step up their battle to rein in hot housing prices.  Development is the key to resolving all our problems, it is the root of maintaining social stability and it is the cornerstone in order for the Communist Party to hold onto power,  Li said. China needs to lower the cost of doing business and create more jobs, with 7.95 million university students and 5 million vocational college students slated to graduate this year as well as 600,000 military personnel set to finish their military service, he said.   In total we have more than 15 million people entering the workforce, plus millions more laid-off workers (from heavy  industries like coal and steel) that need jobs.  Laid-off workers in northeastern China told Reuters earlier this year that they were underemployed and underpaid in new jobs, including as cleaners and forestry workers that the government had assigned them, sometimes earning only a fifth of what they used to, despite rising living costs.  If we cannot create enough jobs, how will we create wealth? How will we maintain social stability?  Li said.

Some in the superyacht industry are seeing a rise in enquires and making plans for when New Zealand hosts the next America's Cup, likely in 2021.

Probably five, but that's a lot to us.   An elaborate superyacht refitting can cost as much as NZ$20 million ($14.65 million), though most involveare between NZ$3 million and NZ$5 million.  Business in the marine industry could potentially increase by 25 percent over the next few years and revenue rise by NZ$500 million as a result of the win,  said Peter Busfield, executive director of the New Zealand Marine Industry. Some superyacht servicers are planning to boost staffing and look to the Auckland Council to increase the number of berths during the next America's Cup.  I'm sure a few plans mooted in the past two or three years will have the dust blown off them,  said Phil Tomlinson, director of 37 South, an Auckland superyacht service that offers everything from refitting to food.

We have a high level estimate that the America's Cup could contribute a billion dollars of economic growth between now and 2021,  he said.  It might be that in four years' time there is much greater interest from places like China... there is an opportunity to get a broader interest in the America's Cup, interest from a broader base of travellers,  O'Riley said. Some government officials warned against overspending around the America's Cup, given that New Zealand already has the infrastructure for it and is accustomed to hosting big sporting events. Many consider the coming Cup an opportunity to attract foreign direct investment, fast-track infrastructure projects and further cast the Pacific island nation onto the international stage.

T.J. Rivera and Bruce had two RBIs apiece to lead the New York Mets to a 6-3 victory over the Miami Marlins on Thursday night at Marlins Park. Bruce scored from first on a double, raced home on a sacrifice fly, made an over-the-shoulder catch in deep right field and legged out his own double on a busy night.  Ooof -- that was a lot,  Bruce said with a smile.  The foul-ball double and then the fair-ball double is what really put me at a deficit early.  Seth Lugo (3-1) earned the win, allowing three runs (two earned) in six innings. Asked about Bruce's sprint-heavy night, Lugo said,  I thought he was going to need some oxygen for the plane.  Lugo is 3-0 against the Marlins and 6-1 on the road in his career. Overall, the Mets have won 10 of his past 11 starts. Related CoveragePreview: Mets at MarlinsNew York Mets - PlayerWatchMiami Marlins - PlayerWatch I didn't think he was as sharp as other times,  Mets manager Terry Collins said of Lugo,  but he moves the ball all over the place. He's tough to figure out.  The Mets got scoreless relief pitching from Jerry Blevins, Josh Edgin and Addison Reed, with the latter picking up his 12th save of the year. Rivera, who started in place of flu-ridden first baseman Lucas Duda, went 3-for-4 as the Mets won for the fifth time in their past six games. New York (36-42) also passed the Marlins (35-42) for third place in the NL East. Miami concluded a 5-5 homestand. In all-time home games against the Mets, the Marlins trail the series 102-101. Marlins starter Jose Urena (6-3), who had won five straight decisions, allowed five runs (three earned) and six hits in six innings.  If it wasn't my pitch count (of 105), I thought I could keep going,  Urena said. Urena got off to a poor start as the Mets scored twice in the first inning. Curtis Granderson hit a leadoff double to left-center and scored on a two-out single by Bruce, who hit an 0-2 fastball that caught too much of the plate. Bruce then made his dash for home on Rivera's double to the left-center gap. New York extended its lead to 5-0 in the third. Granderson got on base when a throw by Marlins shortstop JT Riddle pulled first baseman Justin Bour off the bag. After an infield hit by Yoenis Cespedes, Bruce hit an RBI double, and Rivera laced a run-scoring single. Jose Reyes added a sacrifice fly to score Bruce.  He can swing the bat,  Collins said of Rivera.  He's dangerous. He's an aggressive hitter. He's legit.  Giancarlo Stanton's 21st homer of the season, a solo blast in the fourth, ended Miami's scoreless streak at 13 innings, cutting New York's lead to 5-1. Miami closed its deficit to 5-3 in the sixth. Martin Prado's RBI single scored Stanton from second, and Christian Yelich crossed the plate when Lugo bounced a wild pitch.  We were chipping away,  Stanton said,  but it wasn't enough.  Indeed, the Mets stretched their lead to 6-3 with a run in the seventh. Matt Reynolds, getting a rare start in place of third baseman Wilmer Flores, tripled to the right field corner and scored on a groundout by Granderson. And now the Mets, who have made the playoffs the past two years but trail the NL East-leading Washington Nationals by 10 1/2 games, go home to face the Philadelphia Phillies feeling pretty good despite what so far has been a poor first half of the season.  I know I sound like a broken record and this is a boring interview, but you just have to play good baseball,  Bruce said.  In our case, we have to play great baseball.

He has had his problems this season, but Thursday night he struck out eight and allowed two hits over eight innings and the Baltimore Orioles defeated the Toronto Blue Jays 2-0. Jimenez is 8-5 with a 4.19 ERA in 19 career appearances (17 starts) against the Blue Jays, including a 6 2/3-inning scoreless outing Sept. 29, when he allowed one hit in a no-decision.  Ubaldo has always been tough on us,  Blue Jays manager John Gibbons said.  He was good tonight but he's always had our number. He was sticking it pretty good.   I think that's the best game I've seen him pitch,  Orioles manager Buck Showalter said. Jonathan Schoop and Caleb Joseph each had an RBI for the Orioles, who outhit the Blue Jays 8-3. Jimenez (3-3) allowed one walk to earn his second win in the past three starts. The right-hander threw 71 strikes among 98 pitches in reducing his ERA to 6.48. Related CoveragePreview: Orioles at Blue JaysBaltimore Orioles - PlayerWatchToronto Blue Jays - PlayerWatchBrad Brach took over the ninth for the Orioles and pitched around a one-out single by Russell Martin to earn his 15th save of the season. By winning the rubber match of the three-game series, the Orioles (39-39) took a 9-3 lead in their season series with the Blue Jays (37-41) and returned to .500 for the season. Toronto starter J.A. Happ (2-5) allowed eight hits, two walks and two runs over 6 1/3 innings.  Early in the game I felt real strong, I thought I was getting some early outs, keeping the pitch-count down,  Happ said.  I think any time you keep any team in this league, especially this division, in this ballpark, in the ballpark, you give yourself a chance to win. So overall, I feel pretty good about it.  The Orioles took a 1-0 lead in the third on a sacrifice fly by Schoop. It scored Ruben Tejada, who led off with a single and took third on a double by Joey Rickard. Baltimore added a run in the sixth. Schoop led off the inning with a single to left and was thrown out trying for a double by Ezequiel Carrera. Adam Jones singled, Mark Trumbo flied out to the wall in right, and after a wild pitch, Trey Mancini walked and Joseph hit an RBI single to right. Blue Jays center fielder Kevin Pillar crashed into the wall in right-center to catch Tejada's drive to lead off the seventh inning before Rickard singled to left to end Happ's night.  That was incredible,  Happ said of Pillar's catch.  Just no regard for his body at all. It was unbelievable. We almost get used to that but it's fun to watch.   Hopefully (Pillar) is all right, he seemed to be all right,  Gibbons said.  He's pretty good out there, he's not going to back off, he wins you games doing that.  Dominic Leone replaced the left-hander and retired the final two batters of the inning and threw a perfect eighth inning. Jimenez set down nine straight batters before Pillar doubled to right-center with two out in the eighth, the second hit of the game for the Blue Jays. Ryan Goins, who doubled in the third, fouled out to third to end the inning.  It was fun,  Jimenez said.  Since I was warming up in the bullpen, it felt like I was going to have a good day because everything was moving. The fastball was down in the zone. I had all the breaking balls, I could throw any in any count.  I could throw any pitch in any count. Everything was moving. The splitter was crazy, the slider was good. The fastball was moving in and out. When I threw the no-hitter in Colorado, I had the same feeling.   There really wasn't a bad pitch you could call with Ubaldo tonight,  said Joseph, who caught the game.  He had everything working. That's maybe the best I've ever seen him. It was just flat-out dominant. Toronto's Ryan Tepera pitched a perfect top of the ninth. NOTES: Orioles C Welington Castillo was a late scratch from the lineup Thursday because of a left knee sprain suffered when he slipped on the dugout stairs. His place behind the plate and in the No. 7 spot in the batting order was taken by C Caleb Joseph, who was 2-for-4 with an RBI. ...

Xi, who oversees the PLA in his role as head of the powerful Central Military Commission, repeatedly shouted,  Hello comrades!  and  Comrades, you are working hard!  into four microphones fixed atop his motorcade as martial music blared in the background. The troops, divided into squadrons of 20, responded in unison:  Hail to you chief!  and  Serve the people!  Xi's visit to the Shek Kong barracks in a quiet and lush corner of Hong Kong's New Territories came on the second day of his first trip as president to the financial hub, where he is marking the 20th anniversary of the city's handover from British to Chinese rule. He will oversee the swearing-in of Hong Kong's new leader, Carrie Lam, on Saturday. Xi and invitation-only guests were treated to troops parading in immaculate uniforms and a military display that included Z8 helicopters, mobile air defence missile trucks, armoured cars and light tanks. His visit comes amid heightened tensions between China and Hong Kong, where many people are concerned at what they perceive to be increasing interference by Beijing in the city's affairs. Britain returned Hong Kong to Chinese rule on July 1, 1997, under a  one country, two systems  formula that guarantees wide-ranging freedoms and judicial independence unseen in mainland China. More than 100,000 people took to the streets in 2014 to protest against Beijing's refusal to allow full democracy. The battle for full democracy in Hong Kong has been a defining issue for the city of 7.3 million. It has sown distrust between China and Hong Kong, polarized politics, hampered governance and stoked mass protests. The presence of the PLA in the city has long been one of the most sensitive parts of the city's reversion to Chinese rule, but the garrison has kept a noticeably low-key presence. Hong Kong's large and well-equipped police force - dominated by Hong Kong recruits - remains responsible for routine domestic security and was protecting the streets surrounding the base on Friday. Xi's formal inspection echoed that performed by his predecessor, Hu Jintao, at the same Shek Kong airfield five years ago.

Another motorist who saw the accident also told police Barson had a green light when Williams crossed in front of her.

While 31 of the Topix's 33 subsectors were in negative territory, tech names in particular underperformed after a sharp sell-off in the Nasdaq overnight soured sentiment. The Nikkei dropped 1.2 percent to 19,978.73 in midmorning trade after falling to as low as 19,946.51, the lowest level since June 16. For the week, the benchmark index is on track to fall 0.7 percent, but it is poised to rise 1.8 percent on the month. For the quarter, it has gained 5.8 percent so far. Equity investors are concerned about the rise in interest rates globally, as a host of hawkish comments from central banks signalled the beginning of the end of ultra-loose monetary policy. European Central Bank President Mario Draghi indicated on Tuesday that the central bank could begin to tighten monetary policy, though sources said on Wednesday that Draghi had been overinterpreted by markets. Bank of England Governor Mark Carney surprised many on Wednesday by conceding that a hike was likely to be needed as the economy came closer to running at full capacity. The Bank of Canada had its say, with two top policymakers this week suggesting they might tighten monetary policy as early as July.  Stock markets around the world have been supported by ultra-loose monetary policy by their central banks, so the signs of reversing are frightening investors,  said Yoshinori Shigemi, global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management.  With these central banks hinting at tightening, the next question will likely be to the Bank of Japan asking whether and when it will start discussing exit strategy.  On Friday, data showed that Japan's core consumer prices rose 0.4 percent in May from a year earlier, marking the fifth straight month of gains and offering the central bank some hope a strengthening economy will gradually lift inflation toward its ambitious 2 percent target. Tech shares were sold, with Advantest Corp tumbling 3.0 percent, Panasonic Corp shed 1.9 percent and electronic products maker Ibiden Co declined 2.6 percent. Banking stocks outperformed, after Benchmark U.S. Treasury yields rose overnight. Mizuho Financial Group and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group both rose 0.2 percent.

It is the third suspension at the mine since last October over gas concerns, and the regulator said the colliery would remain closed until it was satisfied that it was safe. Appin and the neighbouring Dendrobium colliery generated A$471 million ($363 million), or about 12 percent of South32's revenue, in the first half of 2017. South32 withdrew staff from the mine on June 28 as a precautionary measure after a fault with the mine's gas extraction system, the company said in a statement emailed to Reuters. It later found gas levels to be within safe limits and notified the New South Wales Department of Planning and Environment.  The regulator then issued a prohibition notice and expressed broader concern regarding the recent gas exceedance events and the operating practices of the Illawarra Metallurgical Coal operation,  South32 said in a statement to the Australian Securities Exchange.  Whilst FY17 production should remain relatively unaffected (given the timing), this suspension will likely roll into FY18,  Royal Bank of Canada analyst Paul Hissey said in a research note. South32 previously suspended operations at the mine last October, and again in May, owing to elevated gas concentrations and said in May that the stoppage would immediately hit sales because of low inventory levels. It also cited difficulties with gas in the mine as the reason for a fall in output for the first half of 2017. The Department said the mine was the subject of targeted regulatory attention  as a result of ongoing safety and compliance concerns  and the suspension would hold until any safety issues had been remedied. The Dendrobium colliery is still operating, the company said.

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said the tool, currently restricted to companies with gross revenues of $1 billion or less, would take effect from July 10. It is the first major policy announcement by new Chairman Jay Clayton, who has said he aimed to reverse the steep decline in IPOs and give individual investors more access to smaller, successful companies.  We are striving for efficiency in our processes to encourage more companies to consider going public, which can result in more choices for investors, job creation, and a stronger U.S. economy,  Clayton said in a statement. Under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act, companies, known as emerging growth companies, are able to withhold registration statements from the public until just before shares are sold, giving them more flexibility about when to go public and more time to work out regulatory kinks. It also means competitors are not alerted to their plans. Now that perk will be available for IPOs as well as most offerings made in the first year after a company has entered the public reporting system, the SEC said. (bit.ly/2sWW212)  I think it will increase the number of IPOs. How dramatically is yet to be seen,  said Michael Zeidel, a partner in the corporate finance department at law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP.  If you are a billion dollar company and may go public, I don't think the confidential filing is going to change your ultimate decision as to whether to go public or not, but it can encourage companies to move more quickly to start the process of filing so they are ready to access the capital markets at the most opportune time.  There has been a stark drop in the number of IPOs in the United States in the last 15 years, driven particularly by a reduction of small IPOs – those with proceeds of less than $30 million - which account for around 10 percent of all IPOs compared to 60 percent in the 1980s. Nonetheless, the JOBS Act had raised several debates with skeptics including some securities regulators worrying it diminished investor protections. Twitter Inc, one of the earliest companies to file confidentially under the then-new JOBS Act, had led to debates, with critics saying that the law denied investors time to digest a company's financial information and eroded market transparency. But, some critics also believed that the law allowed companies and the SEC to have generous discussion about proper disclosures and accounting methods.

Small incursions and troop stand-offs are common along other parts of China and India's contested 3,500 km (2175 miles) frontier, but a flare-up near strategically positioned Sikkim is rare. General Bipin Rawat arrived in Gangtok, the capital of the tiny Himalayan state, before heading off to visit troop formations. A spokesman for the Indian army said the one-day trip was  routine  and planned before the recent tensions. Reports of the incursion and a confrontation between troops emerged as Prime Minister Narendra Modi arrived in Washington to meet U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday, the latest in a line of stand-offs reported during diplomatic initiatives. India has deepened its military ties with the United States in recent years, worrying China, which is also unhappy with India's refusal to participate in Beijing's multi-billion-dollar Belt and Road infrastructure initiative. India is concerned the project could cement China's dominance over Asia.    According to the Chinese interpretation of events, Indian guards crossed into the Donglang region earlier in June and obstructed work on a road on a plateau. The two sets of troops then confronted each other close to a highly strategic valley controlled by China that separates India from Bhutan - a close Indian ally - and gives China access to the so-called Chicken's Neck, a slither of land that connects India to its remote northeastern regions. Indian media have reported that the dispute began when China removed an old Indian bunker. China says that unlike other parts of their shared border, the delineation of the frontier with Sikkim is settled, and it has the right to develop the area.  Donglang Region is part of China's territory,  Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said on Thursday.  China's road-building activities in Donglang on its own territory are totally reasonable and understandable.  Late on Thursday, the ministry released on its website two photographs it said showed Indian troops and at least two Indian military bulldozers on what it said was the Chinese side of the border. The Nathu La Pass, which lies on the frontier between Sikkim and Tibet, was the site of a fierce border clash between Chinese and Indian troops in 1967.

Umbrellas, a symbol of pro-democracy protests in 2014, were also banned but purple alternatives were provided.  The roughly 1,500 guests were told to pull down their souvenir umbrellas, even as temperatures sweltered above 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit), when Chinese President Xi Jinping arrived to inspect a military parade. Security personnel also confiscated a pen, taxi receipts, a 4G dongle, water, mints and pain relief tablets and other medication from Reuters reporters. Several correspondents had their notebooks searched. A list of prohibited items provided to reporters ahead of the visit also included heroin, marijuana, psychotropic substances, sunscreen, cosmetics, microwave transmission equipment, animals and plants.

The force is split between a network of barracks and facilities inherited from the British military in Hong Kong, as well as bases across the border in Guangdong, where its jet fighter planes are kept.

Liu, 61, was jailed for 11 years in 2009 for  inciting subversion of state power  after he helped write a petition known as  Charter 08  calling for sweeping political reforms. He was being treated in a hospital in the city of Shenyang for late-stage liver cancer after being granted medical parole, his lawyer told Reuters on Monday. A deputy head of the justice ministry told the diplomats that Liu's family was happy with the treatment he was receiving and had agreed that he should not be moved, said the source, who declined to be identified. The official did not elaborate. The diplomats asked that Liu and his wife be allowed to communicate directly with the outside world, choose their own hospital and get treatment from a foreign doctor. The Chinese side said that may not be possible, according to the source. On Thursday, U.S.-based rights lawyer and activist Jared  Genser said 154 Nobel laureates had called for Liu to be allowed to travel to the United States for medical treatment. Genser, who has acted as a lawyer for Liu in the past, said in a statement that the laureates made their request in a letter to U.S. President Donald Trump, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and U.S. ambassador to China Terry Branstad.   We urge the Chinese government on humanitarian grounds to grant Liu Xiaobo and Liu Xia's wish to travel to the United States for medical treatment,  Sir Richard Roberts, 1993 laureate in Physiology or Medicine, wrote in the letter on behalf of the laureates. The U.S. State Department said it was gathering details about Liu's condition. Washington called on Beijing to grant Liu full parole, release his wife from house arrest and allow them access to the medical care of their choosing, a spokeswoman, Anna Richey-Allen said, reiterating a previous statement. On Wednesday, Branstad said the United States would like to see Liu treated elsewhere, if that would help him. Liu Xia has been under effective house arrest since her husband won the peace prize in 2010 and was not available for comment on Thursday. Amnesty International told Reuters on Tuesday she had told Chinese authorities she wanted her husband to get treatment abroad. Western politicians and rights activists have voiced concern about the quality of Liu Xiaobo's treatment and have said he should be given the option of leaving China if that was the best option. The U.S. Embassy in Beijing on Thursday declined to comment on any briefing from the authorities. There was no immediate comment from EU officials.  FILE PHOTO: Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo is seen in this undated photo released by his families. Handout viaFile PhotoA German foreign ministry source also declined to comment on the meeting but said Liu should receive the medical treatment that he needs and wants. Another source familiar with the case said no final decision had been made on the matter. China's foreign ministry and justice ministry did not respond to requests for comment. 'Ordinary Prisoner' A video of Liu being treated in jail was released on YouTube, which is blocked in China, late on Wednesday, in what a source close to Liu said was a move by authorities to counter growing concern over his care behind bars. Liu is shown in the three-minute video playing badminton outside, being given a physical examination by prison guards and getting treatment from doctors, as well as being visited by his wife. Student leader Joshua Wong (R) attends a protest demanding the release of Chinese Nobel rights activist Liu Xiaobo outside China's Liaison Office in Hong Kong, China June 27, 2017.Bobby YipIt was not clear who took the video or published it on YouTube but another source, who is close to Liu and his wife, described it as  propaganda , and an attempt by the authorities to respond to criticism of Liu's treatment. The Shenyang legal bureau said in a statement on its website on Wednesday that signs Liu was unwell had been detected on May 31 and he was immediately sent to the hospital where he was now being treated by eight well-known domestic cancer experts.  It said the cancer had spread to other parts of his body. Several family members are with Liu in Shenyang, including his wife, and they had  expressed satisfaction  with his treatment, and had asked he be treated with traditional Chinese medicine, which was now happening, the legal bureau said. Liu had a history of hepatitis B before entering jail, it said, citing prison records, and said he had regular medical checks in prison, which had not previously found signs of hepatitis or tumors. The state-run Global Times said in an editorial Liu had no right to expect special treatment.  Liu is an ordinary prisoner. He ought to be grateful for extra help from the prison authorities, but he and his supporters have no right to demand preferential treatment,  it said. The source close to Liu's family told Reuters that his wife had weeks ago accepted an offer to move to Germany if she and Liu were released, but that was before the diagnosis of liver cancer was made public. Chiu Chui-cheng, deputy minister of the Taiwan Mainland Affairs Council, the island's China affairs policy-maker, said Taiwan was willing to host Liu.  A Hong Kong reporter shouted a question at Chinese President Xi Jinping after he gave a short speech upon arrival at Hong Kong airport, asking if Liu would be released or receive treatment abroad. Xi did not answer. Reporting by Christian Shepherd; Additional reporting by Ben Blanchard in BEIJING, Venus Wu in HONG KONG, J.R.

The two have been feuding bitterly over the $18 billion sale, particularly after Toshiba chose a different consortium as it is preferred bidder. Western Digital, which jointly runs Toshiba's main semiconductor plant, has sought a U.S. court injunction to prevent the inking of any deal without its consent.  On Wednesday Toshiba struck back with a lawsuit, saying Western Digital had interfered in the sale without due cause, adding that it is seeking 120 billion yen ($1 billion) in damages.

The U.S. firm called Toshiba's lawsuit a bid to pressure it to relinquish its consent rights, and added it was confident it would succeed on the legal merits of its arbitration request. Western Digital also reiterated its commitment to invest in their joint ventures, including the Fab 6 production line in Yokkaichi, central Japan.   Toshiba is rushing to sell the unit to cover billions of dollars in cost overruns at its bankrupt Westinghouse nuclear unit.

The Outlook is Stable. Fitch has also affirmed the senior unsecured notes issued by Silver Sparkle Limited (Silver Sparkle) at 'B' with Recovery Rating of 'RR4'. Silver Sparkle is a special-purpose vehicle (SPV) set up to issue the offshore notes on behalf of Fenghui. Fenghui is a Chinese domestically registered leasing company that started a leasing business in 2009. The company provides equipment leasing (77% of total receivables at end-1Q17) and entrusted loans (23%) to clients across China. KEY RATING DRIVERS IDR, Senior Notes and Recovery Rating Fenghui's IDR is constrained by its high risk appetite and weak funding and liquidity, compared with higher-rated peers. Growth in the company's balance sheet has outpaced the sector average, and exceeded its internal capital generation. Fenghui relies on funding from asset-backed securities, trust and asset management products, which are susceptible to volatility in China's liquidity conditions, and the asset quality of the underlying assets. The company is operating with a negative short-term funding gap, although funding diversity has improved in the past year. Fenghui's franchise is modest amid the fragmented and competitive leasing market in China. The management team's track record with Fenghui is short and has yet to be tested through economic cycles. The company has delivered some incremental improvement in its risk-management framework, including installation of an independently functioning risk control officer system. Nonetheless, Fenghui's concentration risk remains significant. At end-1Q17, its 10 largest clients represented 146% of the company's equity. The company's strong asset growth has resulted in a decrease in its impaired loan ratio; however, its concentrated portfolio and unseasoned loans have yet to be tested in an economic downturn. Fenghui has relied on capital injections from its shareholders to support its growth. The company's rapid asset growth reduced its equity-to-assets ratio to 15.9% at end-1Q17 from 23.4% at end-2015. Shareholders announced they would inject an additional CNY2 billion in capital to Fenghui in late 2016. They injected CNY0.5 billion at end-2016, and are likely to allocate the remaining CNY1.5 billion in 3Q17. 1Q17 pro-forma equity ratio stood at 21.4% after factoring in the capital injection. The ratings are supported by the company's high profitability, improving funding diversity, and its moderate use of encumbered assets. However, the company's high profitability may not fully reflect the inherent risk in Fenghui's rapid asset growth and may not be sustained in an economic downturn or during periods of market stress. The guaranteed notes issued by Silver Sparkle constitute general, unsecured and unsubordinated obligation of Fenghui and will rank pari passu with all other existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of Fenghui. The notes are rated at the same level at Fenghui's Long-Term IDR, and carry a Recovery Rating of 'RR4', which reflects average recovery prospects. RATING SENSITIVITIES IDR, Senior Notes and Recovery Rating Sustained improvement in Fenghui's funding and liquidity profile, and improved risk appetite, which may be manifested in reduced asset growth, could lead to a rating upgrade. Deterioration in liquidity and asset quality, including a high encumbered balance sheet and heightened refinancing risk, may lead to a rating downgrade. As the senior notes issued by Silver Sparkle are guaranteed by Fenghui, the ratings on notes would be sensitive to the same factors that drive the guarantor's IDR. In addition, the ratings on the notes would also be sensitive to changes in the Recovery Rating, which is in turn sensitive to changes in the size of issuance relative to guarantor's unencumbered assets and the underlying recovery prospects of these same assets.

Bob Carr was foreign minister before becoming director of University of Technology, Sydney's (UTS) Australia-China Relations Institute (ACRI) in 2014. This month, Carr wrote to UTS researcher and prominent Communist Party critic Chongyi Feng complaining about Feng's public statements suggesting he was barred from the department. In his letter, Carr told Feng he had written to the university's vice chancellor  drawing his attention to your comments and pointing out ACRI has no record of any efforts by you to become involved . ACRI has been in the spotlight since the Australian Broadcasting Corp and Fairfax Media reported this month that the Chinese billionaire who donated A$1.8 million to found the institute was being investigated by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) on suspicion of using political donations in Australia to seek influence on behalf of China. The donor, property developer Xiangmo Huang, was not available for comment. Huang has previously denied acting inappropriately. ASIO said it does not comment on individuals or operational details. The ABC/Fairfax report, strongly criticised by China's ambassador to Australia, fuelled concerns Beijing was using its growing influence to shift public opinion on sensitive policy issues and to stifle criticism. In a statement to Reuters, ACRI said Huang had no involvement in the strategic direction of its budget, research or other programmes.  The Institute is bound by UTS policies and procedures relating to academic integrity, independence and transparency.  ACRI said Carr had written to the vice chancellor to correct the record on Feng's assertions about his attempts to engage with the institute.  Feng has never been in contact with ACRI with any proposal to get involved in any capacity – to collaborate on research or events, or to set up a meeting,  ACRI said. Feng, who now teaches communications, said he applied for a position at ACRI when it was starting up in 2014. An email reviewed by Reuters showed ACRI rejecting Feng for the role of academic director.  I don't know what they might do,  Feng told Reuters at his small UTS office, referring to university management.  I don't want any disciplinary action. I'm in a weak position. I'm not in my research (specialty) so I'm not that important. I'm very, very vulnerable.  A UTS spokesman said the university didn't comment on  internal matters, other than to reaffirm our support for an academic community where diverse views are allowed, and indeed encouraged, as part of a non-negotiable commitment to academic freedom of speech . Carr's letter to Feng showed the mounting pressure Australian universities were under to distance themselves from any suggestion their research was being influenced by a growing pool of private Chinese money, said John Fitzgerald, a professor at Swinburne University of Technology who specialises in China.  For a university, reputation really matters,  he said. Feng published dozens of papers criticising the Communist Party's human rights record in his earlier roles as head of UTS's China studies for 11 years until 2006, then as deputy head of the university's China Research Centre until it folded in about 2014. Earlier this year while undertaking research in China, Feng was questioned and prevented from leaving the country for more than a week in order to  safeguard national security , according to Chinese officials. Carr, who was in China at the time, has said he made representations on Feng's behalf, helping secure his colleague's release. Feng told Reuters he believes he was released as a result of pressure from the international community as a result of media coverage, not Carr's specific intervention.

Concerns about the U.S. military's THAAD missile defense system and China's role in the region also are likely to come up in talks between Trump and Moon at the White House. Moon, making his first trip to the United States since becoming his country's president in May, joined Trump and his wife, Melania, for dinner in the White House State Dining Room on Thursday evening ahead of further talks on Friday.  I know you've been discussing with our people some of the complexities of North Korea and trade and other things, and we’ll be discussing them all as we progress, and it could be very well late into the evening,  Trump told Moon.  I’d like to also congratulate you upon your election victory. It was a great victory, and you did a fantastic job. A lot of people didn't expect that, and I did expect it. I thought that was going to happen.  Both men have an interest in building a strong relationship but tensions could puncture that effort.  Trump has spoken harshly about U.S. trade imbalances with South Korea and threatened to tear up a trade agreement with the country. Moon has taken a wary stance on the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system that the United States deployed in South Korea in March.  I think they’ll have a friendly and frank discussion about the trade relationship,  a White House official told reporters on Wednesday, noting concerns about barriers to U.S. auto sales and surplus Chinese steel that arrives in the United States via South Korea. After the dinner, Trump tweeted that he had a  very good meeting  with Moon and that  many subjects (were) discussed including North Korea and new trade deal!  The U.S. goods trade deficit with South Korea has more than doubled since the KORUS pact took effect in 2012, from $13.2 billion in 2011 to $27.7 billion in 2016. It was forecast to boost U.S. exports by $10 billion a year but they were $3 billion lower in 2016 than in 2011. In an interview with Reuters in April, Trump called the 5-year-old trade deal  horrible  and said he would either renegotiate or terminate it. During remarks at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce on Wednesday, Moon said unfair trade practices would be eradicated and factors that limited competition, such as market entry barriers and price regulations, would be re-evaluated under his administration. Trump has made challenging trade agreements a hallmark of his administration since taking office in January. South Korean President Moon attends a dinner with U.S. President Donald Trump in the White House, Washington, U.S., June 29, 2017.Carlos BarriaNorth Korea Focus Despite tensions over that issue, his meetings with Moon are likely to focus largely on North Korea. Moon has said he wants to form a friendship with the former New York businessman and find common ground on how to resolve the crisis over North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs.  Trump wants to build ties with an important new leader in the region as he grows frustrated that his relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping has not resulted in stronger action by Beijing to rein in Pyongyang. Slideshow (7 Images)The United States on Thursday imposed sanctions on two Chinese citizens and a shipping company for helping North Korea's nuclear and missile programs and accused a Chinese bank of laundering money for Pyongyang. The Trump administration also announced it plans to sell Taiwan about $1.42 billion in arms. Moon told Reuters in an interview last week he wanted to discuss a two-phased approach to resolving the North Korean nuclear issue, starting with a freeze on North Korea’s nuclear and missile development followed by complete dismantlement. “I am planning to have frank and open discussions with President Trump on the step-by-step approach,” he said. The THAAD defense system could be a sticking point.  Moon, who has advocated a more moderate approach toward Pyongyang, expressed shock late last month upon learning that four more launchers for the controversial system had been brought into the country. He ordered an investigation after his Defense Ministry failed to inform him of the move. The system, whose installation irritated China, is meant to counter the threat from North Korea's missile program. The White House said it did not expect THAAD to be a major point of conversation and Moon is expected to assure Washington that his recent decision to postpone full THAAD deployment to conduct an environmental review was a measure to follow domestic law. Despite potential areas of disagreement, the two leaders are expected to express common resolve over threats from North Korea.  The similarities in our approaches are already evident,  the White House official said, noting that both men had expressed willingness to engage with Pyongyang under the right conditions.  Even once the conditions may present themselves, to enter into dialogue we must maintain and actually increase pressure on North Korea. That’s President Moon’s approach; it’s President Trump’s approach.  additional reporting by James Oliphant; Editing by Bill Trott and Tom Brown","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-southkorea-idUSL1N1JQ0I7"},

The official manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) was at 51.7 in June, the eleventh straight month of expansion, and up from 51.2 in May, a monthly survey by the National Bureau of Statistics showed on Friday. It was the fastest pace since March and beat the 51.0 level predicted by analysts in a Reuters survey. The survey supports broad consensus that China's economy is stabilising at a moderate pace rather than slowing sharply, suggesting that Beijing is on track to meet its annual growth target of 6.5 percent for this year - encouraging news for President Xi Jinping ahead of a major leadership reshuffle in the autumn. Production surged to 54.4, marking a strong one percentage point jump from May. New orders in the month also rose to 53.1 from May's 52.3, with export orders surging by 1.3 percentage points to 52.0, suggesting external demand picked up. Nonetheless, most China observers agree that the world's second-biggest economy will continue to cool as authorities reduce high levels of debt across many of the heavy industries, crack down on financial risks and tighten monetary conditions. Growth in the services sector also accelerated to 54.9 in June, the highest since March, another official NBS survey found. The manufacturing PMI showed that the impetus came mostly from larger firms, while small and medium sized industries struggled, suggesting SMEs may be bearing the brunt of the government's deleveraging efforts. China's small and medium-sized firms have grown so acute that many are expected to become unprofitable or even go belly-up this year, boding ill for an economy running short on strong growth drivers. Friday's solid PMI numbers contrasted with a raft of data in recent months that have pointed to ebbing momentum in China, which got off to a strong start to the year when first quarter growth came in at 6.9 percent. Producer price inflation (PPI), for instance, fell for the third straight month in May on tumbling prices of raw materials, reinforcing expectations of a slowdown that would be bad news for debt-laden firms. As policy makers tighten the screws on debt risks, corporates are already facing higher financing costs, which could ripple through to decisions on investment, hiring, and wages over the next year. The real estate sector, a big contributor to economic growth, has also slowed and begun to hit property investment amid persistent curbs aimed at defusing bubble risks. Yet authorities are keen not to tap on the brakes too hard lest it deals a body blow to the economy. China's central bank will hold off on further monetary policy tightening and could even slightly loosen its grip in coming months as a deleveraging drive threatens economic growth and job creation, policy insiders said. Premier Li Keqiang told the World Economic Forum on Tuesday that China is capable of achieving its full-year growth target of 6.5 percent and controlling systemic risks despite challenges. However, maintaining medium to high-speed long-term growth will not be easy, Li said, reinforcing broad expectations of a period of slow growth as authorities rebalance the economic drivers toward consumption and away from its reliance on exports and investment. China's economy grew an annual 6.7 percent in 2016  - the slowest pace in 26 years.

In a defiant speech to parliament a week before she will host a summit of the world's top economic powers in Hamburg, the northern port city where she was born, Merkel did not mention Trump by name but said global problems could not be solved with protectionism and isolation. Her remarks raised the prospect of an open clash with Trump at the summit. She later met with European G20 leaders who promised to present a united front in Hamburg, while making clear they preferred compromise to conflict.  These will not be easy talks,  Merkel said.  The differences are obvious and it would be wrong to pretend they aren't there. I simply won't do this.  The G20 summit will be held a little over a month after a G7 summit in Sicily exposed deep divisions between other western countries and Trump on climate change, trade and migration. A short while later, Trump announced he was pulling the United States out of a landmark agreement to combat climate change reached in 2015 in Paris. Ahead of the G20 summit, Trump's administration has threatened to take punitive trade measures against China, including introducing tariffs on steel imports. This has made for an unusually tense atmosphere before the summit and German officials acknowledge they have little idea what the final communique will look like. Asked about Merkel's comments, Trump's national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, said the U.S. relationship with Germany was  as strong as ever  and played down the discord.  Of course there are going to be differences in relations with any country, and we'll talk frankly about those differences. The president enjoys those conversations,  McMaster told reporters. The German hosts face a difficult challenge. Along with Trump, Russia's Vladimir Putin and Turkey's Tayyip Erdogan will be attending. All have strained relations with Merkel and other European leaders. The summit, in a convention center in the heart of Hamburg, could also be disrupted by tens of thousands of protesters expected to descend on the city of 1.7 million. Existential Challenge Merkel said she was  more determined than ever  to make the Paris accord a success since Trump's decision to pull out, calling climate change an  existential challenge .  We cannot wait until every last person on Earth has been convinced of the scientific proof,  she said.  Anybody who believes the problems of the world can be solved with isolationism and protectionism is making a big mistake,  Merkel said. Trump looks forward to discussing his economic rationale for quitting the deal during his G20 meetings, said Gary Cohn, his top economic adviser.  He’s going to ask for a fair and level playing field. We cannot be in a position where the United States is cutting and cutting emissions while others continue to grow,  Cohn told reporters. French President Emmanuel Macron, in Berlin for the meeting of EU leaders, which included the prime ministers of Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and Britain, said he hoped the United States would  return to reason  on climate. But he also stressed that it made little sense to try to isolate Trump in Hamburg.  The relationship with the United States is a long-term one and it is deep,  Macron said.  I believe we must continue an intense dialogue with the United States because of these ties which are historic and enduring.  At Macron's invitation, Trump will visit Paris a week after the July 7-8 G20 summit for Bastille Day celebrations. They spoke by phone on Tuesday and agreed to work together to respond to any new chemical attacks from the Syrian government. Donald Tusk, the former Polish prime minister who chairs summits of EU leaders, said in Berlin that European countries would speak with one voice in Hamburg, defending the rules-based international order that Trump has called into question.

They are held in locations that are easily shielded from demonstrators. And policy differences are papered over by envoys behind closed doors well ahead of time. But the G20 meeting in Hamburg next week will be different. Host German Chancellor Angela Merkel has taken a high-risk gamble by choosing to hold the summit in the center of the northern port city, partly to show the world that big protests are tolerated in a healthy democracy. This has created a huge challenge for police. On the policy front, she is determined not to surrender too much ground to U.S. President Donald Trump on climate change, trade and migration, possibly setting the scene for an unusual public clash.         Quite honestly, it is hard to know what will happen in Hamburg,  said a senior German official who has been involved in the preparations and who declined to be identified.  It will not be a summit of great unity, that's for sure.    The biggest concern is security,  the official said.  If we have another Genoa, it will be a failure,  the official added, referring to the 2001 G8 summit in which protesters engaged in violent clashes with police. One person was shot dead and hundreds were injured. The stakes are high at the July 7-8 summit for Merkel, who is in the midst of a federal election campaign and can ill afford images of chaos and disharmony. Her relations with three of the most high-profile participants, Trump, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, are strained. Trump and Putin will be meeting face-to-face for the first time, an encounter which will be intensely scrutinized and could overshadow the entire summit. Merkel chose Hamburg, the city where she was born before her father moved the family to communist East Germany, to send a message of openness. It was the nightclubs of Hamburg, which traces its history back to mediaeval times and was badly bombed in World War Two, that helped to launch the Beatles. The city is one of the biggest trading hubs in Europe. It is home to some of Germany's biggest media groups and perhaps its most potent symbol of left-wing dissent, the Rote Flora, a former theater in the city's Sternschanze district that has been occupied by anti-capitalist squatters for nearly three decades. Related CoverageMerkel issues warning to Trump ahead of G20 summitAn additional incentive for Merkel, an avid opera fan, was the opportunity to show off Hamburg's new architectural marvel, the Elbphilharmonie concert hall, where G20 leaders will gather for dinner on the first evening of the summit.  Welcome to Hell  Ahead of the summit, the German government has played up the fact that protesters will be allowed to voice their opposition to the event. The message to leaders like Trump, Putin and Erdogan is clear: tolerance for public dissent is a cornerstone of a confident, open democracy.  We are a country where people have a right to demonstrate,  said Merkel's spokesman Steffen Seibert.  Every citizen has a right to protest. And that counts for the G20 too.  That message has put huge pressure on German police. If they cannot keep the peace, Hamburg officials have acknowledged, it will amount to a defeat for Merkel in her own backyard. Some 20,000 police, with dogs, horses and helicopters and 7.8 kilometers (4.8 miles) of steel barriers will be deployed. French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel on their way to the press conference after the meeting at the Chancellery in Berlin, Germany June 29, 2017.Hannibal HanschkePolice will be facing off against tens of thousands of protesters who plan to encircle the convention center in the heart of the city where leaders will meet - a far cry from Schloss Elmau, the idyllic, isolated retreat in the Bavarian Alps where Germany held a G7 summit two years ago. Security officials say that up to 8,000 of the demonstrators will be anarchists and left-wing radicals whose main goal is to disrupt the summit. They are planning a protest on the eve of the G20 that they have dubbed  Welcome to Hell .  The policies of the G20 have created hellish conditions in many countries around the world,  Andreas Blechschmidt, one of the organizers of the July 6 protest, told Reuters in front of the Rote Flora, which stands just a few hundred meters from the site where the leaders will meet.   We want to show them that we can turn up the heat too,  he said. Behind him, a large banner reading  Capitalism will end anyway, you decide when  hung from the graffiti-covered squat. Other protests will be held on July 7 and 8. Police are also worried about clashes between supporters of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), the militant group engaged in an armed struggle against the Turkish state, and Turkish nationalists who support Erdogan. Slideshow (4 Images) More so than Trump, the presence of Erdogan is mobilizing people across Europe,  said Werner Raetz, a veteran German activist involved in the planning of the G20 protests. Climate, Trade, Migration  On policy however, the German government views Trump and his  America First  doctrine, as its biggest headache. At previous G20 summits, a broadly united West led by the United States and Europe would push countries like Russia, China, India and Brazil to follow its lead. But since Trump entered the White House, the Western consensus has broken down. Trump ignored pleas from his Western allies at a G7 summit in Sicily last month and announced he would pull out of the Paris climate accord. His administration has been threatening countries like Germany and China with punitive trade measures on steel in the run-up to the G20. Washington even appears to be backtracking on language pledging to  fight all forms of protectionism  that Trump approved at the G7, say German officials, who list migration as another source of contention. On both climate and trade, Merkel's best ally in Hamburg may prove to be Chinese President Xi Jinping, who will meet her in Berlin before the summit.  Everything is open,  said Ulrich Speck, senior research fellow at the Elcano Royal Institute think-tank in Brussels.  There is not a clear Western position. It's a big change in the international landscape.  A decade ago, at a G8 summit in Heiligendamm on Germany's Baltic coast, Merkel managed to coax President George W. Bush - who like Trump had pulled out of a global climate pact shortly after taking office - into supporting a new climate deal with substantial cuts in greenhouse gas emissions. In the aftermath, German media anointed her  Gipfelkoenigin , or queen of summits, for her ability to forge sensitive compromises between leaders with disparate views. But in a speech to the Bundestag lower house of parliament on Thursday, Merkel acknowledged that no such compromises were likely in Hamburg.  These will not be easy talks,  she said.  The differences are obvious and it would be wrong to pretend they aren't there. I simply won't do this.

The response by Deutsche's lawyers at Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld is the second rejection by the bank for  information on Trump's finances.  Deutsche Bank has loaned the Trump organization millions of dollars for real-estate ventures, and five Democrats on the House of Representatives Financial Services Committee want information on Trump's finances.  We respectfully disagree with the suggestion that Deutsche Bank freely may reveal confidential financial information in response to requests from individual members of Congress,  Deutsche's counsel wrote in a letter seen by Reuters. Maxine Waters, ranking Democrat on the House of Representatives Financial Services Committee, said in an emailed response to Reuters on Thursday that she would pursue Deutsche Bank.   Trump has made it entirely clear that he has a lot to hide, and it appears that Deutsche Bank is willing to cover for him,  said California's Waters.  Efforts by Trump, his family members and associates, and Deutsche Bank to avoid scrutiny only intensify our resolve to follow the Trump money trail.”  Investigations are being conducted in the United States into possible collusion between Trump's campaign team and Russia during his 2016 U.S. presidential campaign. The White House and the Kremlin have denied that there was any interference in the election.  Waters and four other lawmakers first asked the bank in May to share details about Trump's real-estate business and whether Trump had financial backing from Russia. Deutsche Bank's Washington-based external counsel responded  that it would not share confidential information about Trump's finances. U.S. House Democrats have argued that U.S. federal laws protecting banking customers' confidentiality did not apply to requests from Congress. A disclosure document posted on the U.S. Office of Government Ethics website earlier in June showed liabilities for Trump of at least $130 million to Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas [DBKGK.UL]. The Democrats do not have the power to compel Deutsche Bank to comply with their request.

RadioShack emerged from bankruptcy in 2015 with a deal to co-brand about 1,400 stores with Sprint, which was meant to help the telecoms provider better compete with larger rivals AT&T; Corp and Verizon Communications Inc. However, by early 2017 RadioShack, owned by General Wireless, had returned to bankruptcy and is liquidating. The lawsuit filed in Delaware Superior Court by RadioShack's official committee of unsecured creditors says that Overland Park, Kansas-based Sprint breached its contract with RadioShack, and is seeking $500 million in damages. Sprint allegedly ignored its obligations to provide inventory and staff to RadioShack stores because of its own financial troubles. Sprint spokesman David Tovar said the company was disappointed by the creditors’ committee action and Sprint expected to defend the matter vigorously. A screen shows a Sprint logo above the floor of the New York Stock Exchange shortly before the opening bell in New York, U.S., June 27, 2017.Lucas JacksonThe lawsuit alleges that in 2016, Sprint used confidential information obtained from RadioShack to open 200 competing stores near RadioShack's best locations, sinking any comeback for the electronics chain. “Sprint’s action destroyed nearly 6,000 RadioShack jobs,” said the lawsuit. The allegations stand in sharp contrast to promises made less than seven months ago by the chief executive officer of SoftBank, Sprint’s Japanese parent company, that he would create U.S. jobs. U.S. President Donald Trump made jobs the centerpiece of his election campaign.  SoftBank's Masayoshi Son was among the first foreign business leaders to meet with then-President-elect Donald Trump at his New York headquarters and praised the Republican for a raft of planned deregulations. The CEO promised to invest $50 billion with the aim of hiring 50,000 people in the United States.  Trump took credit for the commitment and reported in late December that Sprint had committed to bringing 5,000 jobs to the United States.

The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, last stood at 95.598. That was near a low of around 95.53 touched this week, its lowest level since early October 2016. The euro eased 0.1 percent to $1.1430, backing away slightly from a peak of $1.1445 set this week, the common currency's strongest level in almost 14 months. The euro has risen rapidly following Tuesday's speech by European Central Bank President Mario Draghi that convinced markets the ECB was preparing to start reducing its aggressive monetary stimulus later this year. In addition, comments from Bank of England Governor Mark Carney and two top Bank of Canada policymakers on Wednesday ramped up expectations for interest rate increases from those central banks.  Obviously there's a shift afoot. It really seems that there's some coordinated effort going on out here among the G10 central banks,  said Stephen Innes, head of trading in Asia-Pacific for OANDA in Singapore, referring to the series of hawkish-sounding comments on monetary policy.  I think what we're seeing right now, it's a really tempting market. So this could be more about the fact that nobody wants to miss out on the party,  Innes said, adding that the euro could add to its gains in the near term. For the April-June quarter, the euro was on track for a gain of about 7.3 percent, its best quarterly performance since the July-September quarter of 2010. Sterling edged up 0.1 percent to $1.3016, having gained 2.3 percent so far this week. Market participants' lingering doubts that the Fed would be able to raise interest rates again this year, have weighed on the U.S. dollar.

Appointed Vatican economy minister by Francis, Cardinal George Pell is the highest-ranking Church official to face such accusations. He asserted his innocence and said the pontiff had given him leave of absence to return to Australia to defend himself.  I am looking forward finally to having my day in court. I repeat that I am innocent of these charges. They are false,  the 76-year-old told a news conference at the Vatican.  The whole idea of sexual abuse is abhorrent to me.  Pell's high-profile departure, even if temporary, puts pressure on a pontiff who has made compassion for the vulnerable his watchword, and has declared zero tolerance for a child abuse scandal that has beset the Church for decades, but has struggled to overcome resistance in the Church hierarchy and clergy. Pell was hand-picked by Francis to sit on a panel of nine cardinal-advisers to give a greater voice to the Church's global flock, and the new broom he chose to reform the Vatican's opaque finances. But Pell, a former archbishop of Melbourne and Sydney, had come under pressure from an Australian government commission on institutional child abuse, and had himself been under investigation for at least a year. On Thursday, police in the Australian state of Victoria, where Pell was a country priest in the 1970s, said he faced  multiple charges in respect of historical sexual offences  from multiple complainants. They did not detail the charges or specify the ages of the alleged victims or the period when the crimes were alleged to have occurred. He was originally ordered to appear before Melbourne Magistrates' Court on July 18, but that date was later pushed back to July 26. Australian police declined to say why the court date had been changed.   Pell, who declined to take questions, decried a  relentless character assassination  by the media and said he wanted to  clear my name and then return to my work in Rome . Victims Angry Related CoveragePope grants top adviser Pell leave to fight abuse chargesFactbox: Cardinal George Pell, senior Vatican adviser, charged with sexual offencesAustralian Catholic Church says Cardinal Pell 'strenuously denies' sexual assault chargesVatican spokesman Greg Burke said Pell would not appear in public Church services for the time being. Pell told the Australian inquiry last year that the Church had made  catastrophic  choices by refusing to believe abused children, shuffling abusive priests from parish to parish, and relying too heavily on the counsel of priests to solve the problem. But he angered victims by saying he was too ill to fly home, testifying instead from Rome.  He indicated on Thursday that he would now go to Australia.  I have spoken to my lawyers about when I need to return home and to my doctors about how best to do this,  Pell said. Francis said last year Pell should not undergo trial by media.  It's in the hands of the justice system and one cannot judge before the justice system ... After the justice system speaks, I will speak,  the pontiff said. Cardinal George Pell leaves his house in Rome, Italy, June 29, 2017.Remo CasilliThe indictment of such a close adviser raised questions about Francis's choice of personnel and his ability finally to root out the sexual abuse that had been tolerated or ignored in the Church for decades, and act against those who covered it up. Marie Collins, the top non-clerical member of the commission on abuse that Francis established in 2014, and its last remaining victim of priestly abuse, quit in frustration in March, citing a  shameful  lack of cooperation within the Vatican. She said the Vatican administration had even ignored a specific request from the pope that all correspondence from abuse victims should receive a response.  The long, aching scandal that stained the previous two popes - Vatican passivity to clergy abuse cases - is the swamp Pope Francis faces,  said Jason Berry, author of  Lead Us Not Into Temptation , a book about sexual abuse in the Church.  Unless the pope engineers systemic change, the crisis will get worse,  Berry told Reuters. Francis was impressed by Pell when they met in 2013. In meetings among cardinals before the conclave that elected Francis pope that year, the former Australian Rules football player stood out not only for his height and broad shoulders but also for his command of financial matters. Slideshow (7 Images)After becoming pope, Francis, hoping to put an end to Vatican financial scandals, moved Pell to Rome to head a new ministry, the Secretariat for the Economy. After initially giving Pell sweeping powers, the pontiff later clipped his wings when other departments accused him of an overbearing manner and of being condescending to the Italian-dominated Curia, the Church's central administration. Thousands of Victims  Church sexual abuse broke into the open in 2002, when it was discovered that U.S. bishops in the Boston area had simply moved abusers to new posts instead of defrocking them. Thousands of cases have come to light around the world as investigations have encouraged long-silent victims to go public, shattering the Church's reputation in places such as Ireland, and more than $2 billion has been paid in compensation.     Under previous popes, the Vatican, a sovereign state in the middle of Rome, sheltered officials wanted by other countries. In the early 1980s, the Vatican refused an Italian request to hand over Archbishop Paul Marcinkus, an American who was then head of the Vatican bank and was wanted for questioning about the fraudulent bankruptcy of a private Italian bank. Cardinal Bernard Law of Boston moved to Rome after a sexual abuse scandal erupted in his diocese, and has been living in the Italian capital for more than 15 years. Victims' groups were outraged when Law, now 85 and retired, was given a plum job as chief priest at a Rome basilica by the late Pope John Paul II. However, Francis was tough in the case of Jozef Wesolowski, a former archbishop who was accused of paying for sex with minors while serving as papal ambassador in the Dominican Republic. Wesolowski was recalled in 2013, defrocked and arrested in the Vatican in 2014, but died shortly before his trial was due to start in 2015.

We are not taking sides  in litigation between holders of $18 billion in general obligation (GO) debt and nearly the same amount in sales tax-backed debt known as COFINA bonds, Governor Ricardo Rossello told Reuters.  I can safely say that.  In an exclusive interview, Rossello, a 38-year-old Massachusetts Institute of Technology alumnus elected governor in November, discussed creditor disputes, his relationship with Puerto Rico's federal oversight board, and the island's push for U.S. statehood.  The son of a former governor, Rossello is trying to lead the island out of a crisis marked by $72 billion in debt, a 45 percent poverty rate, insolvent public pensions and a shrinking population. GO and COFINA bondholders are battling for first claim on Puerto Rico's sales tax revenue, as part of the island's massive bankruptcy filed in federal court in May. Some COFINA creditors believe Rossello's government favors GO bondholders, after a GO group issued a joint statement with the administration in March saying they had begun restructuring talks. COFINA holders also point to the government's unsuccessful April restructuring offer that would have repaid GO holders nearly 20 cents on the dollar more than COFINA creditors. But Rossello said the restructuring offer was based on the market value of the bonds.  The skeptics read it wrong,  he said.  He also defended recent legislation allowing the government to redirect COFINA assets into the general fund. The law, he said, was necessary to comply with a fiscal turnaround plan approved in March by the island's oversight board, which requires the pooling of funds available to pay debt.  If we did not do that, the opposite argument would have been made ... that we've already decided [in favor of] COFINA,  he said. Rossello insisted his government wants clarity on which side is entitled to the funds, just as creditors do.  We've asked the courts to speed up and decide  that issue, he said. Private Investment, With Local Input Rossello is in an odd position - the head of state for an island whose economy is under the supervision of a federal board, created by the 2016 Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act, or PROMESA.  The board, appointed by U.S. lawmakers, is tasked with managing Puerto Rico's finances and helping it regain access to capital markets.  Ricardo Rossello, Governor of Puerto Rico, listens to a question during an interview in New York, U.S., June 29, 2017.Shannon Stapleton Is it a unique, bizarre situation?  he said.  Yes. I have to govern ... with policy decisions being made at the federal level that have an impact on Puerto Rico and seeing how I can meet it half-way.   Rossello said  the jury is still out  on whether the board has helped or hindered Puerto Rico. The governor has objected to statements by the board that the island could face furloughs if it cannot meet cost-savings benchmarks.   The board's job is to make sure we have balanced budgets and the potential to come into the markets again,  Rossello said.  They're not here to design policy. That's my job, that's the government's job.   One major policy initiative, set to begin this summer, is to seek bids on public-private partnerships, to incorporate private investment first on smaller projects like maritime transport, then bigger, energy and sewer infrastructure endeavors. Rossello said he wants to attract $5 billion of investment within the next three years, and to create as many as 100,000 jobs. Slideshow (3 Images)Too much outside investment could be risky: For decades, Puerto Rico's economy was based on tax breaks to lure outside firms. But when the tax breaks left, so did the jobs. Rossello said that, far from  selling off Puerto Rico,  his plan - at least on larger projects - is to have between 25 and 45 percent of the investment from local investors.  It was something the local community was asking for - being part of bigger projects, even if they can't own it,  Rossello said. A Push for Statehood Rossello began his political career as a wavy-haired grassroots organizer of the pro-statehood movement.  Now cleaner cut and living in the governor's mansion, Rossello has to balance the statehood debate with managing a dire financial crisis. Still, making Puerto Rico the 51st U.S. state is a top priority for Rossello. He reiterated calls for U.S. Congress to recognize the results of a June 11 plebiscite in which Puerto Ricans voted overwhelmingly in favor of U.S. statehood, even though voter turnout was only 23 percent. And with other U.S. territories facing similar economic squeezes, most notably the U.S. Virgin Islands, Rossello called the territorial system  inherently flawed.  Territories face a  lack of political participation and lack of democratic rights,  he said.   Puerto Rico's participation per capita in the armed forces is more than most states, yet they can't vote for their commander in chief,  he said.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-puertorico-debt-rossello-exclusive-idUSKBN19K327"},

Newly-crowned women's world number one Ryu So-yeon, who won the year's first major at the ANA Inspiration, made a smooth start with a tidy 69 in front of a small afternoon gallery that included her mother Cho, the cathedral-like silence on the course broken mainly by an occasional passing train along the line that runs adjacent to the first fairway. Co-leader Choi was particularly pleased with her score after only one practice round, leaning heavily on her father-caddie Ji for advice.  I played just 18 holes before the tournament, so I don't remember every hole,  said Choi, winner of one LPGA event.  But I ask my dad, every hole, every shot and my shots were very good today.

You now can, but it will come at a cost. The Rafa Nadal Tennis Academy, which opened last autumn on the Spanish island of Mallorca, is charging kids 56,000 euros ($62,000) a year for tennis lessons and school. Patrick Mouratoglou's new academy on the French Riviera, where his protege Serena Williams and Novak Djokovic have trained, will set you back close to 40,000 euros a year, while the IMG Academy in Florida costs $78,250. With a cool 31.6 million pounds ($40 million) up for grabs at Wimbledon, including 2.2 million pounds for the singles winners, tennis at the top is a highly lucrative sport. But with most players now peaking in their late 20s and teenage grand slam winners few and far between, the cost of developing a tennis pro is rising while there are no guarantees that your child will make it as a professional. With half of all 14,000 professional tennis players making no prize money at all, are big-name academies worth it?  There is no rule, everything is possible,  Mouratoglou told Reuters in an interview at Roland Garros in Paris this month.  But the best way to succeed is to be surrounded by professionals,  said Mouratoglou, founder and chief executive officer of the Mouratoglou Tennis Academy.  In tennis clubs, they have no experience of that. It's a different thing, a different job.   One-Stop Shop  The €70 million Mouratoglou Tennis Academy near Nice, France currently has 170 full-time students between the ages of 11 and 18. Opened by 23-times major winner Williams last year, its 12 hectare state-of-the-art site houses 34 clay and hard courts as well as a sports medicine center, two pools (one in the shape of a tennis racket) and an athletics track.  Although Mouratoglou acknowledged that  most of the kids are not going to be champions  he said the investment is not in vain because his program teaches them important life skills while also serving as a springboard to a top U.S. university. Related CoverageFactbox: The cost of tennis academies We are No.1 in France to send players to American universities with scholarships, we send 60 players every year,  he said.  It's also a way to tell them (the parents) the investment you made that is huge for several years is worth it, because now your son or daughter has a great university and you don't have to pay for it.  Nadal echoed that line in comments to reporters last year about the philosophy behind his own academy in Mallorca.  At the international school, we are going to help them make that transition to the best universities possible and prepare them for life,  said Nadal, who never attended an academy but was coached by his uncle, Toni Nadal, from the age of four.  Craig O'Shannessy, an Australian strategy analyst for the men's ATP World Tour and a coach with more than 20 years experience, said the academies were just one of several options for would-be tennis champions.   Twenty years ago we wouldn't be taking our kids out of school to do this. Now, the bigger academies have become a one-stop shop where you can do your schooling and your tennis,  he told Reuters.  But I certainly wouldn't say it's the only option. I still think there is a lot of different ways to get there, whether it's other federations or other small academies or other private coaches.  For O'Shannessy, who has helped, among others, former top 10 player Kevin Anderson, nothing beats one-on-one attention when teaching technique, whereas academies focus much more on group lessons due to higher numbers and a restricted number of courts.  Cheaper Options Although Mouratoglou’s academy is cheaper than IMG or the Nadal academy, the Frenchman conceded:  The price is high and I know most parents cannot afford that.  Mouratoglou said he had been helping out players including Argentina's Renzo Olivo – who beat France's Jo-Wilfried Tsonga at Roland Garros – with his own money for years.  In 2014, Mouratoglou created a foundation which now has 15 players who are being supported in the form of training and fitness. He also recently launched an online platform that provides coaching via a website or app.   Phil Wright, father of 17-year-old budding tennis pro Marco Wright, moved his entire family from England to Portugal in 2012 after being quoted an annual fee of 25,000 pounds for a tennis academy in London.  Wright, a former semi-pro football player, enrolled his son at a local Lisbon club for a fraction of the London fees. Wright said his son had thrived in Portugal, where he is now enrolled at the JCS Tennis Academy near Lisbon led by former Portuguese Davis Cup player Joao Cunha-Silva. He trains daily with Portuguese pros including Fred Gil, a former world No. 62, and Felipe Cunha-Silva, who is ranked inside the top 400 in men's doubles.  We've saved an incredible amount of money,  said Wright.  I've personally invested about 50,000 pounds in his (Marco's) career. I know people who spent that in a year.  Instead of playing junior events on the ITF circuit across Europe – which can be very costly - Marco is now playing Futures events in Portugal and is ranked in the top five in the Under-18 age group in the country.  If he makes it, fantastic,  said Wright.  If he doesn't, then at least he knows for the rest of his life, he gave it his best shot.  Parental Pressure Paying a small fortune to advance a child's tennis career can put a lot of pressure on budding stars from an early age.  If you are paying a lot of money, you want the results,  said O'Shannessy, who as a coach has run academies himself.  Parents have some education on the process but the big thing is, they want results now. And tennis is not a results-now sport. It takes a lot of time, it takes development, it takes losing a lot of matches.  Editing by Gareth Jones","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-tennis-wimbledon-academies-idUSKBN19L03F"},

The Trump administration expects to delay the release of the hotly anticipated study until after Trump has spoken with G20 leaders at the summit in Germany next week, another administration official said on Thursday, requesting anonymity. The official said the delay was due to July 4 holiday week scheduling issues, with  no cause or linkage  to the Group of 20 meeting.    But the  Section 232  review will be a hot topic at the gathering in Hamburg. The report could lead to broad new U.S. quotas or tariffs on imported steel, and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross had previously said he hoped to reveal its findings by the end of June.  The premise of that report we will use as an opportunity to talk with many of our trading partners around the world about what's going on in steel,  Cohn said on Thursday. The study invokes a Cold War-era trade law that allows the president to restrict imports of goods deemed critical to national defense. The administration official declined to provide details on the findings of the study, which the department aims to use as a catalyst to help reduce excess global production capacity, particularly in China. But American companies that consume steel have been  vigorously  lobbying Trump administration officials against major new tariffs on foreign steel that would raise prices of the key raw material, a lobbyist with clients on both sides of the debate said. He compared the anti-tariff push to efforts by corporate CEOs in April to stop Trump from withdrawing from the North American Free Trade Agreement, with many calling the White House to try to persuade the president to change his mind. Russia requested a discussion on the U.S. steel 232 investigation at the World Trade Organization's Council for Trade in Goods meeting on Friday, signaling that any new import restrictions could face challenges from WTO members. Russia is a significant steel exporter to the United States. The Trump administration, asked whether provisions would be made for NATO allies, many of whom supply steel products to the U.S. defense industry, to negotiate an exemption from tariffs, said:  I wouldn’t call them exemptions. There is an interest in negotiating collective action which would deal with the problem in a more global way.   Ross has said he believes there is a  genuine  national security concern over the steel industry's health and one possible remedy is to impose import quotas on certain products coupled with tariffs on any amounts that exceed the quotas. Ross told a German economic conference that such measures might have to be  broad-scale  but would be aimed at provoking a collective solution to deal with global steel excess capacity. Cohn told the news briefing on Thursday that Trump would engage in discussions with G20 counterparts about promoting  free and fair trade,  including taking concrete actions to solve the excess capacity problems in the steel sector. But Cohn added that the Trump administration  will act to ensure a level playing field for all.

{"news_time":"2017-06-29 20:59:00","news_title":"How June 1 U.S. soybean stocks might translate to demand: Braun","keywords":"Brazil,United States,US,USA,SOYBEANS,BRAUN,Commentaries,South America / Central America,Brazil,Soybean,English,Grains,Embargoed,Reports,United States Department of Agriculture,Emerging Market Countries,United States","sector":"","content":"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Many industry analysts were surprised that healthy U.S. soybean demand did not prompt USDA to raise old-crop exports in its June update. But when the U.S. Department of Agriculture publishes its quarterly grain stocks report on Friday, the results will have demand implications for old-crop soybeans beyond just exports.  Friday's report will reflect U.S. grain and oilseed supplies as of June 1. The average trade guess for soybean stocks as of June 1, 2017, is 983 million bushels. If realized, this would mark the third-largest inventory for that date, trailing only 2007 and 2006. And it would be 13 percent higher than current third-place 2016, when June 1 soybean reserves tallied 872 million bushels. March 1, 2017, soybean stocks were exactly 13 percent larger than on the same date one year earlier. This implies that analysts have assumed a similar rate of domestic soybean use relative to supply for the spring of 2017 as in the same period in 2016.  Soybeans are used for two purposes in the United States: exports and crushing for protein-rich meal and oil. Although monthly crush numbers have somewhat disappointed in recent months, springtime crush measured against expectations to exactly the same degree as during spring 2016. But shipments and bookings have been stronger than year-ago, supporting the argument that USDA needs to increase its 2016/17 export target of 2.05 billion bushels. One factor supporting U.S. demand of late is that farmers in top-exporting Brazil have been reluctant sellers of their bumper crop as prices and exchange rates are unfavorably low. U.S. export sales to date for the 2016/17 marketing year have surpassed USDA’s target to a greater degree than in years past, and weekly export inspections have been elevated since April relative to previous years, reflecting the lower availability of Brazilian supplies. July Adjustments If USDA reveals tighter-than-expected June 1 soybean stocks on Friday, the assumption by analysts might be that 2016/17 exports will rise by a somewhat proportional degree in the agency’s July update.  But it is not that simple.  For one, the correlation between lower-than-expected June 1 stocks and an export increase in July is difficult to discern. USDA has lowered old-crop soybean exports in July only once since 2005 but has increased it nine times. The disparity between analyst stock guesses and the actual June 1 supply does not appear to have any bearing on the degree to which exports increased in the next month, either.  But supply disappearance does not have to show up in exports or crush. In its supply and demand updates following stock reports, USDA notoriously shuffles supply in and out of residual – a category that contains unaccounted-for demand.  Soybean residual is relatively small, usually never larger than 100 million bushels, but USDA’s June-to-July residual adjustments have generally been larger than adjustments to either exports or crush. And changes to this category in July have the best – and perhaps the only – relationship to the trade bias on June 1 stocks of any item on the balance sheet.  Although slimmer June 1 inventory might confirm that soybean demand is truly as healthy as it appears, whether that ends up reflected in exports, crush, or residual is less important when it comes to the end game: ending stocks. As long as the stocks report is not bearish for soybeans, USDA is likely to trim 2016/17 soybean carryout – estimated at a decade-high 450 million bushels – in its July update based on past habits. The agency has lowered old-crop ending stocks in 14 of the past 20 Julys and left it unchanged in another three.  June 1 stocks were extremely bearish in at least two of the three years in which USDA increased carryout from June to July, so the outcome of Friday’s report will set the tone for USDA’s supply and demand update on July 12.

Much of the increase in LNG capacity is because of the rapid boost to plants in Australia and the United States, as both countries take advantage of abundant local reserves of natural gas to muscle in on a market that until recently had been dominated by a few established producers and buyers. But it is perhaps ironic that while the action on the capacity side of LNG is an Australian and American story, the ultimate controlling player of the emerging global natural gas market is likely to be Europe. This is because Europe is likely to act as a  clearing house  for surplus LNG cargoes, given it has excess re-gasification capacity and the ability to use the fuel for a variety of purposes, from power generation to manufacturing to household heating. Europe is also the only region that can effectively arbitrage between LNG and pipeline prices, given its connection to Russian and other Eastern natural gas via pipelines. The continent is also best-placed to use market forces to find a price level for natural gas versus its competitors, given it still has substantial coal-fired power in some countries as well as being a leader in renewables such as wind and solar. To understand Europe's role in the LNG market, it's worth examining how the dynamics of trade in the super-chilled fuel are changing with the rise of Australia and the United States. LNG has traditionally been an opaque and tightly-controlled market, where a small number of exporters signed long-term, oil-linked contracts with an equally small number of buyers, who were more concerned about energy security than price. The major producers included Qatar, Indonesia and Malaysia, while the top buyers were concentrated in North Asia, namely Japan and South Korea, and also in Europe. It was inevitable that this situation would be disrupted once global energy giants such as Chevron, Royal Dutch Shell, ConocoPhillips and Exxon Mobil decided to pour some $200 billion into developing eight new LNG projects in Australia. Three of these are ground-breaking ventures based on using coal-seam gas as feedstock, one is the biggest floating LNG project and the rest are conventional offshore gas to onshore liquefaction plants. When the last of these new plants is operating, most likely by 2018, Australia will have around 80 million tonnes of annual LNG capacity, overtaking Qatar as the top exporter of the fuel. Not far behind Australia on the development scale is the United States, with 16 million tonnes of LNG capacity already operating at the Sabine Pass facility in the Gulf of Mexico. A further 60.5 million tonnes of annual capacity is under construction, and will arrive from late in 2017 to the end of 2019, with the bulk scheduled to be commissioned in 2018. Lng the Last to Boom and Bust? The International Gas Union (IGU), the industry's lobby group, said in its annual review in April that there was 340 million tonnes of LNG capacity as at the end of 2016, and a further 114 million tonnes under construction as of the start of this year. In some ways, LNG is the last cab off the rank in the commodity boom that saw massive capacity expansions in iron ore, coal and crude oil as part of the recovery from the 2008 global recession. Much of the investment in commodity projects was driven by the belief that China, the world's top commodity consumer and importer, would continue to soak up everything the world could throw at it. As can be seen from the five years of price declines for coal and iron ore from 2011 to 2015, this was a forlorn hope, even though China has continued to increase its imports of natural resources. LNG is equally likely to move into an oversupply situation by 2020, notwithstanding increased imports by China and the emergence of new buyers in Asia, such as Pakistan and Singapore. It's this oversupply dynamic that is changing the way LNG is traded, with buyers no longer willing to lock into long-term contracts linked to the price of crude oil. While it will take several years for these contracts to disappear entirely, buyers are having success in negotiating shorter-term deals, or even taking more spot cargoes. As a consequence, the spot price of LNG in Asia has plummeted in recent years. From a record $20.50 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) in February 2014, LNG was last at $5.40 in the week to June 23, down nearly 75 percent. The drop in Asian spot LNG prices has led them to converge with prices in Europe, with the British National Balancing Point (NBP) price actually exceeding the Asian spot price in May and June last year, according to the IGU. The difference between the two benchmarks averaged just 91 cents per mmBtu in 2016, the IGU said, showing how dramatically the Asian premium has narrowed in recent years, having been as high as $6 per mmBtu at the end of 2013. Front-month NBP futures ended at the equivalent of $4.88 per mmBtu on June 28, meaning spot the Asian LNG price commanded a premium of just 52 U.S. cents. Benchmark U.S. Henry Hub natural gas futures were at $3.067 per mmBtu on June 28, showing that the three main regional benchmarks are fairly close to each other. This becomes even more the case when the approximately $1.50 per mmBtu cost of liquefaction, already included in the spot Asian price, is added to the NBP and Henry Hub prices. The economics of the LNG market then come down to shipping costs across various routes, and it's here that Europe comes into its own. It's highly unlikely that Australian LNG will flow to the Atlantic Basin, given the long sea voyage, which adds to the cost but also increases the loss from boil-off of the LNG being shipped. This means Australian LNG will have to find a home in Asia, either among traditional buyers or emerging markets in Southeast Asia, where its geographic position gives it an advantage over Qatar and producers in Africa or the United States. The swing supplier will likely be the United States, which can ship to both Europe and Asia, as well as Latin America. It's also likely that Qatar may feel increasing pressure in Asia as it has to compete with new Australian supplies, meaning it either has to find new buyers in East Asia or push more cargoes westward to Europe. Flows Show Changing World The new dynamics of LNG trade can already be seen in flows around the world. In 2016, 278.9 million tonnes of LNG moved by ship globally, according to vessel-tracking and port data compiled by Thomson Reuters, a 7.6 percent hike from the 259.2 million  shipped the prior year. Of that total, 41.7 million tonnes went to Europe, while 156.5 million went to North Asia, which includes Japan, South Korea and China, and 33.2 million was shipped to the rest of Asia. Back in 2013 total LNG trade stood at 243.9 million tonnes, with 38.5 million going to Europe, 151.5 million to North Asia and 17.7 million to the rest of Asia. What this shows is that Europe and North Asia grew slowly in the past four years, while emerging Asia surged on the back of rising imports by India and newer buyers such as Singapore and Pakistan, and even by traditional exporters like Malaysia. Looking at the breakdown by exporting country shows that Australia has gone from shipping 23.7 million tonnes in 2013 to 46.1 million in 2016. Of Australian shipments in 2016, 39.6 million tonnes went to North Asia, up from 21.4 million in 2013.  Qatar shipped 34.7 million tonnes to North Asia in 2016, down from 40.5 million in 2013. It seems clear that Australia is supplanting Qatar as the main supplier to North Asian markets, a trend that's likely to continue as the Pacific nation brings another 40 million tonnes of LNG capacity on line by 2018. Qatar has had success in boosting its shipments to the rest of Asia and to Europe, but it will also face pressure in those markets. Australia has gone from shipping 65,900 tonnes, or just one cargo, to the rest of Asia in 2013 to supplying 3.1 million tonnes in 2016, and it's likely that its producers, especially those on the northwest coast, will be trying to gain a bigger foothold in markets like India and Sri Lanka. Overall, the global LNG market is becoming more competitive, driven by increased supply and buyer demands for more flexibility. These trends are set to continue in the coming years, creating a far larger spot market and likely seeing the demise of restrictive destination clauses and oil-linked pricing. It's also the case that much of the demand growth for LNG will be concentrated in Asia, but that doesn't necessarily mean the region will become the hub for LNG. The main problem in establishing an LNG trading hub is that the fuel isn't just simply a natural gas version of crude oil. Long-term storage is problematic given the boil-off that occurs when LNG is placed in land-based tanks or on ships. While newer LNG vessels can use boil-off as fuel for the engines, it's unlikely that LNG can be stored and traded multiple times, as is currently common in crude oil. Singapore would like to become Asia's LNG hub, but this would require massive infrastructure investment and the development of a regional pipeline system that would allow LNG to be re-gasified and then transported and stored. While this may happen over time, the absence of storage and interconnecting pipelines across Asia limits the continent's chances of being the center of the LNG universe. Rather, it's Europe with its plentiful re-gasification capacity and pipeline and storage infrastructure that can play that role. Among European countries, Spain has the best potential as an LNG hub, given its proximity to Qatar (through the Suez canal), West and North African producers and the United States. Spain has 49 million tonnes per annum in re-gasification capacity, but only 21 percent of this was being utilized in January this year, according to the IGU. Elsewhere in Europe, Britain has 35 million tonnes of re-gasification but, like Spain, only 21 percent was in use in January. In contrast Japan's 197 million tonnes of capacity had a utilization rate of 43 percent, South Korea's 101 million tonnes was used at 35 percent and China's 49 million tonnes at 56 percent. While it's clear that the big buyers in North Asia can take more LNG, it's also obvious that Spain and Britain can take substantially more LNG. They also have the means to use the natural gas, while demand in both Japan and South Korea has been largely steady in recent years, although China is witnessing strong growth. Overall, when the rest of Australia's LNG hits the market, it will likely push more Qatari cargoes to Europe. As the U.S. LNG comes on stream, it can choose whether to got to Europe or Asia depending on the price. Europe will become the destination of last resort for an increasing number of spot LNG cargoes, meaning it gets to set the price that determines where the fuel goes. Despite being a substantially smaller market than Asia, Europe will become the kingmaker in LNG.

On Thursday, about 6 million barrels of North Sea Brent crude were being stored on ships, down from four-month highs of as many as 9 million last week, and trading sources said it seemed now refineries were starting to take in more cargoes.  The uptick in demand has tilted the physical Brent market has into backwardation, where prices for prompt-loading cargoes were trading above those for delivery further in the future. This typically suggests the supply of oil for immediate delivery is harder to come by, but the North Sea market has been dogged in the last month by persistent oversupply that has seen traders store oil on ships rather than sell it.      The floating fleet is starting to shrink partly because of a  shift in the derivatives market that has made it more attractive to sell cargoes now, rather than hold out for higher prices further ahead.  Sentiment in the oil market remains morbid even though the physical market is perhaps showing some signs of emerging green shoots, thanks to Chinese teapots (refiners) slowly starting to come back to the market for crude,  consultant Energy Aspects said. The Brent crude futures price has risen by 8 percent to two-week highs above $47 a barrel in the last six days, its longest stretch of gains since April, even though concern about rapidly expanding global supply has prompted a number of market watchers to urge caution over the longevity of this move upward. Swaps Point to Deficit The contracts-for-difference (CFD) market, a derivative used to price and hedge trades of physical barrels of oil, shows prices for cargoes loading in one week's time now command their largest premium over those loading in two weeks' time for nearly six months. One-week CFDs are trading at a premium of about 12 cents to two-week rates, from a premium of closer to 20 cents a week ago and the price of a barrel of physical Brent is at six-week highs. Traders holding physical oil could  make a good sale  if they had bought the oil a couple of weeks ago and were now ready to sell it on the spot market, one trading source said. A major driver of the weakness in both the physical and the futures market has been the resistance of global crude inventories to the efforts of OPEC and its 11 major partners to force a drawdown by cutting their oil production. OPEC and a number of exporters such as Russia and Oman agreed to extend a 1.8-million barrels per day production cut into March next year to force global inventories to return to their long-term average levels and help price rise.  The structure of the two main crude oil futures contract suggests that the market is well balanced for the time being,  said PVM Oil Associates analyst Tamas Varga, referring to the structure of the Brent and U.S. crude futures market.

Then he got hot. Grichuk hit a go-ahead three-run homer with two outs in the seventh inning after Matt Carpenter was intentionally walked, then added a two-run double in a five-run eighth inning when the Cardinals pulled away for a 10-4 victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks at Chase Field on Thursday.  I would think every player, any time anybody gets intentionally walked to face you, you have got get (mad) and think that was a mistake and go up there with confidence and try to make them pay,  Grichuk said.  It definitely shows there's not much respect. It feels good to come in and do well in that situation.  Pinch-hitter Luke Voit doubled with two outs in the seventh before reliever Rubby De La Rosa (0-1) threw three balls to Carpenter. The D-backs then waved him to first base instead throwing another pitch. Grichuk hit a 1-2 breaking ball 421 feet down the left field line for a 5-3 lead. It was his third homer in five games. De La Rosa said he was trying to throw the ball in the dirt. Related CoveragePreview: Cardinals at DiamondbacksSt. Louis Cardinals - PlayerWatchArizona Diamondbacks - PlayerWatch You have an established major league hitter who has a tremendous track record,  Arizona manager Torey Lovullo said of Carpenter.  We talked about it pregame in certain situations, we would rather have the guy on-deck beat us. Not a very traditional move, to put the go-ahead run on base. But I felt the matchup and the stuff with Rubby would be better for the next hitter.  The Cardinals (37-41) loaded the bases with one out in the eighth inning on an infield error, a single and a walk before pinch-hitter Tommy Pham singled in two runs. After Pham stole second, Grichuk doubled in two more runs and scored on Stephen Piscotty's double to make it 10-3. Grichuk's five RBIs were one shy of his career high achieved against the Mets in 2015. Paul Goldschmidt and Jake Lamb had bases-empty homers and Gregor Blanco had a double, a triple and an RBI for the D-backs (50-30), who lost a second straight home game for only the second time this season. The D-backs have won 13 of 17 overall and are 30-12 at home in their franchise-record start. Lance Lynn (6-5) gave up three runs on four hits in six innings, benefiting from Grichuk's homer to get the victory. He struck out seven and walked one. Jedd Gyorko had two hits and Jose Martinez had a two-run single for the Cardinals, who have won four of five. They led 5-2 in the first game of the series Friday before losing in 10 innings.  Just the kind of series we need to put in the memory bank,  St. Louis manager Mike Matheny said.  This is more like what we need to do. This is how it should be. That first game was one of the best games we played all season. We just didn't finish it up right.  Lynn retired the first seven he faced before Ketel Marte doubled in the third inning and scored on a double by Blanco, who broke an 0-for-18 slump. Marte's hit was his first with Arizona since being recalled Wednesday. He was obtained in the Taijuan Walker-Jean Segura offseason deal from Seattle. Grichuk and Gyorko singled around a walk to Piscotty to load the bases with no outs in the fourth inning before Martinez hit a two-run single for a 2-1 lead. Arizona starter Patrick Corbin struck out two while pitching out of a bases-loaded, no-out jam to leave it there. Goldschmidt led off the fourth inning with his 19th homer to tie it at 2.

Back in October, Ahmad, 17, was rehoused in a reception center in Rennes, in the western Brittany region, and began the process of seeking asylum. He soon became disillusioned with the slow pace of French bureaucracy. After four months he gave up. Now his days are spent trying to climb aboard trucks and trains headed across the English Channel and evading riot police armed with batons and tear gas. He has no easy access to running water and relies on charities for food handouts.  Aid agencies and government officials estimate as many as 600 migrants have converged on Calais. Some, like Ahmad, were housed in the squalid  Jungle  camp before it was dismantled, others are newcomers. All seek a better life in Britain.       We know it is dangerous, but we have no other possibility because France is not giving answers on asylum requests so people come back here,  Ahmad said in broken English.      The police here they are very hard on us. Thank God I can run fast, like Usain Bolt,  he said with a defiant smile. Ahmad's personal belongings amount to little more than a mobile phone and wallet, carefully tucked in a light sports jacket. A charity gave him a plastic sleeping bag. His plight highlights how France and the European Union are struggling to find a coherent answer to a migration crisis that has tested cooperation between member states. French President Emmanuel Macron wants France's asylum process sped up. Italy, bearing the brunt of migrant arrivals across the Mediterranean, pressed on Wednesday for more help from the bloc. The OECD said the number of migrants fleeing war or poverty globally fell marginally in 2016 from a record high in 2015.

We knew migrants would come back. The weather is improving and many of them tell us others are on their way,  said Francois Guennoc of aid group Auberge des Migrants. Another charity worker, Gael Manzi, said there had been an outbreak of scabies among the migrants because living conditions were so dire. Macron has promised migrants will be treated humanely after the national human rights watchdog was fiercely critical of the living conditions they face.  Nonetheless, his interior minister, Gerard Collomb, last Friday dismissed charities' call for a new migrant reception center in Calais, saying it would act as a magnet, and said he would deploy extra riot police to contain the influx. A local court backed the government's stance but ruled local authorities must provide drinking water, toilets and showers.  Calais Mayor Natacha Bouchard said on Twitter she would file an appeal. Regional prefect Fabien Sudry also said he was considering an appeal against some of the court's decisions.  We are determined to prevent any kind of permanent settlement in the Calais area,  Sudry said.  These are complex issues. And we want to avoid creating any new pull effect.   Sudry denied accusations of police violence and said only one complaint had been submitted to the police so far this year.

Is Washington one reliever away from being a really good team?  We are a really good team now,  Washington manager Dusty Baker said.  We still need some help  in the bullpen. Anthony Rendon hit a two-run, go-ahead homer in the seventh off Carl Edwards, Jr. to give the Nationals a 3-2 lead. Rendon hit a full-count pitch to left for his 16th homer of the year and 11th in his last 32 games. Pinch-hitter Brian Goodwin of Washington had a bases-loaded single to drive in a run against reliever Pedro Strop to make it 4-2 later in the seventh. Jeimer Candelario hit his first major league homer -- a solo shot to start the seventh -- to give the Cubs a 2-1 lead off starter Joe Ross. The homer came in his 42nd at-bat over the past two seasons.  It worked out well,  said Joe Maddon, the Cubs manager.  Tommy, great at-bat and Jon Jay, struggling all night, and then ball in the gap. There you have it.  Ross gave up two runs and five hits in 6 2/3 innings.  It was tough today because Joe pitched a heck of a game. Our bullpen was spent today because we didn't have (Matt) Albers, we didn't have (Enny) Romero  since they pitched Wednesday, Baker said. The Cubs took a 1-0 lead in the top of the first as Anthony Rizzo doubled with two outs and then scored on a single to left by Willson Contreras, who was thrown out trying for a double. Washington tied the game in the bottom of the first. Bryce Harper walked with two outs and then scored on a double down the right field line by Ryan Zimmerman. The double by Zimmerman tied the Montreal/Washington franchise record for doubles in a career at 360, also held by Tim Wallach. Zimmerman broke into the majors with Washington in 2005 and entered Thursday leading the league in slugging at .632. Chicago starter Jon Lester gave up just three hits and one run in six innings with seven strikeouts.  It was a bad series of events,  Baker said of the loss. NOTES: Cubs SS Addison Russell (shoulder) was back in the starting lineup for the first time since Sunday, when he left the game in Miami with a sore shoulder. He pinch-hit in the Monday and Tuesday games in Washington. ... 3B/OF Kris Bryant (ankle sprain) did not play Thursday . He left Wednesday's game in the fifth inning after stepping on the third-base bag after catching a foul pop. He could return Tuesday, according to manager Joe Maddon. ... Cubs OF Mike Zagunis, who made his major league debut June 22, was drafted out of Virginia Tech in 2014 by Chicago. He walked as a pinch-hitter in the seventh. ... Washington manager Dusty Baker was ejected for the first time as the Nationals manager, after arguing a strikeout by Ryan Raburn in the sixth. ... Washington SS Trea Turner left the game in the top of the ninth after he was hit by a pitch on the arm in the seventh.  It will probably be sore for a couple of days,  Baker said. ... Washington is the only National League that has not been shutout.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-cubs-nationals-writethru-idUSMTZED6UC1QUPM"},

The blaze, dubbed the Goodwin Fire, has charred nearly 25,000 acres (10,120 hectares) and destroyed an unknown number of homes since erupting on Saturday in the Prescott National Forest, 70 miles (113 km) north of Phoenix. Stoked by high winds as it roared through dense, sun-baked chaparral, the blaze raged largely unchecked for the first few days, but by Thursday firefighting teams had managed to carve containment lines around 25 percent of the perimeter.  This means that we are really making progress on the fire,” said Tiffany Davila, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Forestry and Fire.  Crews are really getting a handle on the fire and all their efforts ... seem to be coming into play.  Residents of Mayer, a town of 1,400 people evacuated on Tuesday, were allowed to return home on Thursday morning, said Dwight Develyn, a spokesman for the Yavapai County Sheriff's Office. But Develyn said about 2,000 residents forced to flee from 10 other communities during the week remained under evacuation orders. About 1,400 children at summer camps in the area were also sent home, according to Sheriff Scott Mascher.

The Goodwin blaze was one of more than two dozen large, active wildfires reported burning on Thursday across Arizona and eight other U.S. states.  Heavy rainfall in parts of the West over the winter and spring helped delay the onset of fire season, but also spurred the growth of dense vegetation that has now dried out and become highly combustible as summertime heat sets in. Wildfires have scorched nearly 2.8 million acres so far this year, compared with 2.1 million acres at this point in 2016, according to the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise, Idaho. Forecasts called for hot, dry weather and gusty winds across much of the Southwest this coming holiday weekend, posing a lingering fire threat for the region.

In a court filing, Hawaii said the U.S. government intended to violate the Supreme Court's instructions by improperly excluding from the United States people who actually have a close family relationship to U.S. persons. The 90-day ban took effect at 8 p.m. EDT (0000 GMT Friday) along with a 120-day ban on all refugees. On Monday, the Supreme Court revived parts of a travel ban on people from six Muslim-majority countries, narrowing the scope of lower court rulings that had blocked parts of a March 6 executive order and allowing his temporary ban to go into effect for people with no strong ties to the United States. The court agreed to hear arguments during its next term starting in October to decide finally whether the ban is lawful. The Supreme Court exempted from the ban travelers and refugees with a  bona fide relationship  with a person or entity in the United States. As an example, the court said those with a  close familial relationship  with someone in the United States would be covered. The Trump administration decided on the basis of its interpretation of the court's language that grandparents, grandchildren and fiancés traveling from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen would be barred from obtaining visas while the ban was in place. In its court filing, Hawaii echoed criticism from immigrant and refugee groups that the Trump administration had defined too narrowly who should be exempted. Hawaii called the refusal to recognize grandparents, fiancés, and other relatives as an acceptable family relationship  a plain violation of the Supreme Court's command.  Hawaii's Attorney General Doug Chin asked U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson in Honolulu, who blocked Trump's travel ban in March, to issue an order  as soon as possible  clarifying how the Supreme Court's ruling should be interpreted. Karen Tumlin, legal director of the National Immigration Law Center, said the administration's guidance  would slam the door shut on so many who have waited for months or years to be reunited with their families.  Asked how barring grandparents or grandchildren makes the United States safer, a senior U.S. official did not directly answer, but instead pointed to Trump's guidance to pause  certain travel while we review our security posture.  The U.S. government expects  things to run smoothly  and  business as usual  at U.S. ports of entry, another senior U.S. official told reporters. The administration said that refugees who have agreements with resettlement agencies but not close family in the United States would not be exempted from the ban, likely sharply limiting the number of refugees allowed entry in coming months. Refugee resettlement agencies had expected that their formal links with would-be refugees would qualify as  bona fide.  But U.S. officials said on Thursday that, for now, that sort of relationship was not enough to qualify refugees for entry. The administration's decision likely means that few refugees beyond a 50,000-cap set by Trump would be allowed into the country this year. A U.S. official said that as of Wednesday evening, 49,009 refugees had been allowed into the country this fiscal year. The State Department said refugees scheduled to arrive through July 6 could still enter. Trump first announced a temporary travel ban on Jan. 27, calling it a counterterrorism measure to allow time to develop better security vetting. The order caused chaos at airports, as officials scrambled to enforce it before being blocked by courts. Opponents argued that the measure discriminated against Muslims and that there was no security rationale for it. A revised version of the ban was also halted by courts. The State Department guidance, distributed to all U.S. diplomatic posts on Wednesday evening and seen by Reuters, fleshed out the Supreme Court's ruling about people who have a  bona fide  relationship with an individual or entity in the United States. It defined a close familial relationship as being a parent, spouse, child, adult son or daughter, son-in-law, daughter-in-law or sibling, including step-siblings and other step-family relations. A department cable said grandparents, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, cousins, brothers-in-law and sisters-in-law, fiancés,  and any other 'extended' family members  are not considered close family. The guidelines also said that workers with offers of employment from a company in the United States or a lecturer addressing U.S. audiences would be exempt from the ban, but that arrangements such as a hotel reservation would not be considered bona fide relationships.

The OPEC member has been raising oil production to recoup market share lost under Western sanctions to regional rivals such as Saudi Arabia. Its exports last year also showed a similar decline in July before recovering sharply from August. Overall oil output was hovering at more than 3.9 million barrels per day (bpd) and is expected to reach 4 million bpd by March 2018, Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh said this month. Crude oil loadings from Iranian ports, excluding condensate from gas fields, will total 1.93 million bpd next month, with 2 million barrels of them being put into storage on tankers, according to the source. Loading figures for condensate, an ultra-light crude, were not available for June and July. Total crude exports for July will be 1.86 million bpd, up 2 percent on a year ago, with 1.28 million bpd destined for Asia and 580,000 bpd to Europe. That compared with 1.30 million bpd shipped to Asia and 700,000 bpd to Europe this month. The biggest buyer China is set to load 658,000 bpd in July, the highest amount since last September and up 3 percent from June. India remained the second-biggest buyer and is to load 395,000 bpd next month, down 15 percent on June, the source said. India has been curbing Iranian oil imports in a possible retaliation for Tehran not awarding a gas field development to Indian companies. India's Iranian oil imports in May fell to their lowest since June 2016. Japan is scheduled to lift 134,000 bpd in July, up 34 percent from June and the highest since January. Loadings of crude for South Korea next month are to hit a four-month high of 97,000 bpd, up from 90,000 bpd this month. In Europe, main buyer Turkey is lifting 194,000 bpd next month, down 27 percent from June. Italy is loading nearly 100,000 bpd, down from 133,000 bpd this month.

Yet despite having a flourishing business he does not pay any tax. Until now, his rundown premises and small scale operation has kept the business below the radar of India's tax officials. Come July 1, however,  the party will be over , says the 51-year-old, with a resigned shrug. A nationwide Goods and Services Tax (GST), set to come into effect on Saturday, has faced criticism for its complex design. But the country's biggest tax reform since independence is promising to bring millions of firms like Sachdeva's into the tax net, boosting government revenues and India's sovereign credit profile. The new tax will require firms to upload their invoices every month to a portal that will match them with those of their suppliers or vendors. Because a tax number is needed for a firm to claim a credit on the cost of its inputs, many companies are refusing to buy from unregistered businesses. Those who don't sign up risk losing any customer who has.  I have no option, but to register with the new system,  said Sachdeva, who spoke to Reuters on condition the name and precise location of his shop were not disclosed. Boosting the Coffers Improved tax compliance should shore up public finances, augmenting resources for welfare and development spending and giving a lift to the $2 trillion economy. India currently has one of the worst tax-to-GDP ratios among major economies at 16.6 percent, less the half the 34 percent average for the members of the OECD and also below many emerging economies. While there is no official estimate of the potential fiscal gain, some tax experts say the measure, after the initial teething trouble, would lift the tax-to-GDP ratio by as much as 4 percentage points as the number of tax filers is estimated to more than treble to 30 million.  In future, compliance is going to be extremely crucial,  Rajiv Nair, chief executive officer at Kaya Ltd., told Reuters.  Since we are also responsible for compliance across the supply chain, we have to ensure that the suppliers we have are in a position to work with us in a compliant manner.  Nair's company, which makes beauty and personal care products, has just streamlined its supply chain, dropping vendors that were not going to be GST-compliant. Other companies are doing the same. Elior Group, a French catering and food service company, said it has mandated GST-compliance as one of the eligibility criteria for its orders. Winners and Losers The unorganised sector of India's economy is vast, employing an estimated nine out of 10 workers. While staying outside the GST regime risks losing business, joining it will necessitate an overhaul of firms' accounting systems and an investment in technology. The new tax system requires three filing a month plus an annual return - a total of 37 filings - for each of India's 29 states in which a firm operates. For smaller companies operating on wafer thin margins, hiring accountants and technical staff could substantially dent their bottom line. Sanjiv Mehra, head of a traders' body in Delhi, reckons a  prohibitive  cost could prove to be counterproductive.  Compliance is needed for input tax credit,  he said.  But what if you are in a business where margins are strong and allows you to forsake credit?  But despite its flaws, many analysts think the new tax will be good news for bigger established businesses, because it will sweep away an array of federal and state sales taxes, levied at different stages of the supply chain, that often result in double taxation. The government estimates the GST will save companies around $14 billion because it will allow them to organise their warehouses and supply chains more efficiently. Firms can now move to demand-based  hub-and-spoke  models used globally, rather than operating state-by-state.  Those companies which can wring out the maximum cost efficiency are the ones investors should bet on,  said Ajay Bodke, head of portfolio management services at financial firm Prabhudas Lilladher in Mumbai.  All consumer-facing industries will be big beneficiaries of the GST.

The Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative (AMTI), part of Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies, said new satellite images show missile shelters and radar and communications facilities being built on the Fiery Cross, Mischief and Subi Reefs in the Spratly Islands. The United States has criticized China's build-up of military facilities on the artificial islands and is concerned they could be used to restrict free movement through the South China Sea, an important trade route. Last month, a U.S. Navy warship sailed within 12 nautical miles of Mischief Reef in a so-called freedom of navigation operation, the first such challenge to Beijing's claim to most of the waterway since U.S. President Donald Trump took office. China has denied U.S. charges that it is militarizing the sea, which also is claimed by Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam. Trump has sought China's help in reining in North Korea's nuclear and missile programs, and tension between Washington and Beijing over military installations in the South China Sea could complicate those efforts.

In February, Reuters reported that China had nearly finished building structures to house long-range surface-to-air missiles on the three islands.

Two more domes are being built at Mischief Reef, it said. A smaller dome has been installed near the missile shelters on Mischief,  indicating that it could be connected to radars for any missile systems that might be housed there,  AMTI said.

Lingmerth won a Web.com Tour event in 2012 on the tight Maryland layout near Washington D.C. and once again relied on his accuracy off the tee. The Swede, without a top 10 finish on tour this season in 17 events, missed just two fairways as he carded seven birdies and two bogeys, including one at his closing hole, the par-three ninth.  That's one of the main keys out here,  said Lingmerth.  It's a course where the rough is very penalising, very gnarly. You really got to stay in the fairway to have a chance to make birdies.  Lingmerth said it was a happy homecoming.  Obviously, coming here is going to give me great feelings knowing I have won here on the Web,  he said.  It seems to suit my eye really well.  Six players were bunched one shot back, including Australian Marc Leishman, Canadian Nick Taylor, South Korean Sung Kang and Americans Troy Merritt, Johnson Wagner and Daniel Summerhays, who holed out from 105 yards at the par-four 13th. Another seven players were tied at three-under 67. Lingmerth, showing signs of a return to form with four top-20 finishes since late April, started at the 10th and ran off three birdies in a row from 13, capping the string with an 18-foot birdie putt at the 15th. The Swede knocked his approach inside four feet at 18 for another birdie and made the turn at four-under 31. He added birdies at the first and fourth, where he rolled in a 20-footer from the fringe, before making bogey at the last after an errant tee shot at the par-three ninth. Thirty-one players broke par but two of the top names in the field were not among them. Rickie Fowler posted an even-par 70, while this season's three-time winner Justin Thomas suffered a nightmare round. Thomas made five birdies but signed for a four-over-par 74, fueled by a quadruple bogey nine at the par-five 10th. Thomas pulled his tee shot left into heavy native scrub land beyond the thick rough. He failed twice to advance the ball and finally took a penalty stroke and dropped a ball, which he sent across the fairway into more trouble. He was tied for 93rd, nine strokes off the pace.

(bit.ly/2sWW212) The confidential review process after the IPO reduces the potential for lengthy exposure to market fluctuations, the SEC said. Clayton has said he wants to reverse the steep decline in IPOs and give individual investors more access to smaller, successful companies. (Reporting by Sarah N.

A volunteer at the festival, Adi, 28, now fears that instead of safeguarding their rights authorities are targeting his community, forcing them to hide their lifestyles or even consider moving abroad.     Indonesia's Islamists have long sought to criminalize gay sex. The Islamic Defenders Front (FPI), the vigilante group that threatened the now defunct Q! film festival in Jakarta, has previously broken up what they said were gay parties and then urged the police to detain the men.  But what is sending a new chill through the gay community is that police seem to have taken on the vice patrol role themselves. In May, officers detained 141 men in a raid on the Atlantis sauna, accusing them of involvement in a gay prostitution ring in a part of Jakarta that is also home to many heterosexual  spas . A month earlier, police raided a hotel in Indonesia's second-biggest city of Surabaya over an alleged  sex party  and made the 14 detained men undergo HIV tests before publicly releasing the results, local media reports said.       Before this, we used to think of the police as our safety net when mass organizations, or anyone claiming to represent the people, came to attack us,  said Adi, who works in e-commerce and asked to be identified using only one name.  Now if I want to do anything, I'll do it in my apartment, in a private space,  he said, adding he was thinking of emigrating.  u.s. Congressional Letter With the exception of the ultra-conservative Aceh province in northern Sumatra, where Islamic law is enforced and two men were publicly flogged last month for gay sex, homosexuality is legal in Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim country. Police denied targeting the LGBT community. The police raided the Atlantis and the Surabaya hotel because the gatherings there had caused  turmoil in the community , national police spokesman Rikwanto said.  As long as they are kept private and their (LGBT community's) personal affairs are kept to themselves, then it will not be a problem,  he said. Indonesia's reputation for tolerance and pluralism was already under scrutiny after Jakarta Governor Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, an ethnic Chinese Christian, was sentenced last month to two years in prison for blasphemy in a trial that came after mass Islamist-led rallies last year. FILE PHOTO: A bath is seen on the second floor of the club where police detained 141 men for what they described as a gay prostitution ring, in Jakarta, Indonesia May 23, 2017.Darren Whiteside/File PhotoHis case highlighted the role of Islamic vigilante groups like the FPI, who helped organize the protests against him. The groups are known for raiding bars and brothels during the fasting month of Ramadan. Some have been suspected in arson attacks on churches. Predominantly Muslim Indonesia has substantial minorities of Christian, Buddhist, Hindus, Confucianists as well as non-Sunni Muslim creeds, such as Shias, who have expressed worries about the vigilantes.  Members of the U.S. Congress sent a letter to the Indonesian government last week, stating their concern over the reports of possible human rights abuses targeting the gay community.  These attacks are an unfortunate symptom of the growing radicalisation in Indonesia that has targeted women, religious and ethnic minorities, and which could negatively impact diplomatic relations and foreign investments in your country, if left unchecked,  said the letter signed by 35 congress members. An Indonesian presidential spokesman declined to comment on the letter. President Joko Widodo last year gave qualified support for the gay community, telling the BBC  there should be no discrimination against anyone , but noted homosexuality is not popular in his country. Homosexuality remains a taboo topic with the public, which is why the gay community gathers away from the public eye in saunas and underground parties. A Pew Research Center poll in 2013 found 93 percent of respondents in Indonesia disagreed that  society should accept homosexuality .    Shared on Social Media Activists say controversial anti-pornography laws, under which offenders can face up to 15 years' jail, were being misused against some of those rounded up during the recent raids in Jakarta. Police also seemed to be using shaming tactics in the raids.   The men detained at Jakarta's Atlantis sauna were nearly all later released without charge, but not before being strip-searched, photographed and marched semi-naked from the venue into vehicles. Adding to their humiliation, photos were then shared on social media.   Honestly, after what happened, I'm scared. Because what the police stripped naked was not just your body, but your name, your place of work. I'm a lecturer so it could be a problem for me,  said Ahmad, 33, who works at a university in Jakarta. He declined to give his full name or place of work, but nonetheless pledged he would not be deterred from visiting gay bars in Jakarta. Amnesty International said the police raids were further evidence of an  increasingly hostile environment  for the gay community, fueled over the past year by  reckless, inflammatory and inaccurate statements made by public officials apparently under the guise of ‘defending public morality’.    Vice President Jusuf Kalla last year asked the United Nations Development Programme to stop $8 million of funding of LGBT-related activities in Indonesia, while Defence minister Ryamizard Ryacudu has suggested homosexuality was part of a  proxy war  waged by foreign states.

Deals in India and South Korea will also drive a pick up in the region's equity capital markets (ECM) activity that -  according to preliminary Thomson Reuters data - rose 7 percent across Asia-Pacific exchanges in the first half of 2017, versus an almost 50 percent drop in the corresponding year-ago period. While IPOs in Shanghai and Shenzhen, both currently ahead of Hong Kong in IPO rankings, are expected to slow down after more than doubling so far this year, volumes will still be strong enough to boost activity, the bankers and analysts said.  China has curbed the pace of IPO approvals to prevent an oversupply of shares, but it remains the busiest market in the world for new listings. A queue of almost 600 companies waiting to go public indicates there is no shortage of deals.  They've decided to reduce the pipeline of IPOs, but the reality is that the market still needs a lot of money,  said Ringo Choi, Asia-Pacific IPO leader at consulting firm EY. New listings in China were a key driver of the $85.5 billion of equity offerings in Asia-Pacific in the first half, which offset an 8.1 percent decline in follow-on share sales, according to Thomson Reuters data through June 27. For Hong Kong, EY forecast about $25.8 billion of IPOs this year, only a quarter of which has been achieved so far. Most of this will come from end-2017 listings by state-owned China Tower Corp - which operates the mobile phone network for China's three wireless carriers - and Sinopec Marketing Co Ltd that are expected to raise at least $10 billion each.  These IPOs should push Hong Kong up the world IPO rankings, bankers said. It was No.1 last year, but dropped to No.4 as new listings fell 41.5 percent over the first half of 2017. Follow-on offerings or block trades, however, remained strong in the city, jumping 71 percent, and are expected to grow, helped by an 18 percent rally in local stocks.  The overall market backdrop has improved from a year earlier and global investors are now more willing to allocate capital to Asia,  said Aaron Arth, head of Financing Group in Asia ex-Japan at Goldman Sachs. Among the IPOs Hong Kong is expected to see this year are, at least a $1 billion listing from Zhong An Online Property and Casualty Insurance, China's first online-only insurer, and $1 billion each from China United Insurance Holding Corp and Ping An Securities . Despite political upheaval, South Korea's deal activity has surged and it was home to the largest IPO so far in the region - the $2.3 billion from Netmarble Games Corp.  Volumes are seen rising further with budget airline Jin Air Co Ltd, Kyobo Life Insurance [KYOBO.UL] and Celltrion Healthcare expected to go public in the second half of 2017. In India, offerings from insurers including General Insurance Corporation of India, SBI Life Insurance and New India Assurance, as well as National Stock Exchange are expected to lift ECM activity, on top of expected deals from infrastructure investment trusts.

A volunteer at the festival, Adi, 28, now fears that instead of safeguarding their rights authorities are targeting his community, forcing them to hide their lifestyles or even consider moving abroad.     Indonesia's Islamists have long sought to criminalize gay sex. The Islamic Defenders Front (FPI), the vigilante group that threatened the now defunct Q! film festival in Jakarta, has previously broken up what they said were gay parties and then urged the police to detain the men.  But what is sending a new chill through the gay community is that police seem to have taken on the vice patrol role themselves. In May, officers detained 141 men in a raid on the Atlantis sauna, accusing them of involvement in a gay prostitution ring in a part of Jakarta that is also home to many heterosexual  spas . A month earlier, police raided a hotel in Indonesia's second-biggest city of Surabaya over an alleged  sex party  and made the 14 detained men undergo HIV tests before publicly releasing the results, local media reports said.       Before this, we used to think of the police as our safety net when mass organizations, or anyone claiming to represent the people, came to attack us,  said Adi, who works in e-commerce and asked to be identified using only one name.  Now if I want to do anything, I'll do it in my apartment, in a private space,  he said, adding he was thinking of emigrating.  u.s. Congressional Letter With the exception of the ultra-conservative Aceh province in northern Sumatra, where Islamic law is enforced and two men were publicly flogged last month for gay sex, homosexuality is legal in Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim country. Police denied targeting the LGBT community. The police raided the Atlantis and the Surabaya hotel because the gatherings there had caused  turmoil in the community , national police spokesman Rikwanto said.  As long as they are kept private and their (LGBT community's) personal affairs are kept to themselves, then it will not be a problem,  he said. Indonesia's reputation for tolerance and pluralism was already under scrutiny after Jakarta Governor Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, an ethnic Chinese Christian, was sentenced last month to two years in prison for blasphemy in a trial that came after mass Islamist-led rallies last year. FILE PHOTO: A bath is seen on the second floor of the club where police detained 141 men for what they described as a gay prostitution ring, in Jakarta, Indonesia May 23, 2017.Darren Whiteside/File PhotoHis case highlighted the role of Islamic vigilante groups like the FPI, who helped organize the protests against him. The groups are known for raiding bars and brothels during the fasting month of Ramadan. Some have been suspected in arson attacks on churches. Predominantly Muslim Indonesia has substantial minorities of Christian, Buddhist, Hindus, Confucianists as well as non-Sunni Muslim creeds, such as Shias, who have expressed worries about the vigilantes.  Members of the U.S. Congress sent a letter to the Indonesian government last week, stating their concern over the reports of possible human rights abuses targeting the gay community.  These attacks are an unfortunate symptom of the growing radicalisation in Indonesia that has targeted women, religious and ethnic minorities, and which could negatively impact diplomatic relations and foreign investments in your country, if left unchecked,  said the letter signed by 35 congress members. An Indonesian presidential spokesman declined to comment on the letter. President Joko Widodo last year gave qualified support for the gay community, telling the BBC  there should be no discrimination against anyone , but noted homosexuality is not popular in his country. Homosexuality remains a taboo topic with the public, which is why the gay community gathers away from the public eye in saunas and underground parties. A Pew Research Center poll in 2013 found 93 percent of respondents in Indonesia disagreed that  society should accept homosexuality .    Shared on Social Media Activists say controversial anti-pornography laws, under which offenders can face up to 15 years' jail, were being misused against some of those rounded up during the recent raids in Jakarta. Police also seemed to be using shaming tactics in the raids.   The men detained at Jakarta's Atlantis sauna were nearly all later released without charge, but not before being strip-searched, photographed and marched semi-naked from the venue into vehicles. Adding to their humiliation, photos were then shared on social media.   Honestly, after what happened, I'm scared. Because what the police stripped naked was not just your body, but your name, your place of work. I'm a lecturer so it could be a problem for me,  said Ahmad, 33, who works at a university in Jakarta. He declined to give his full name or place of work, but nonetheless pledged he would not be deterred from visiting gay bars in Jakarta. Amnesty International said the police raids were further evidence of an  increasingly hostile environment  for the gay community, fueled over the past year by  reckless, inflammatory and inaccurate statements made by public officials apparently under the guise of ‘defending public morality’.    Vice President Jusuf Kalla last year asked the United Nations Development Programme to stop $8 million of funding of LGBT-related activities in Indonesia, while Defence minister Ryamizard Ryacudu has suggested homosexuality was part of a  proxy war  waged by foreign states.

RadioShack emerged from bankruptcy in 2015 with a deal to co-brand about 1,400 stores with Sprint, which was meant to help the telecoms provider better compete with larger rivals AT&T; Corp and Verizon Communications Inc. However, by early 2017 RadioShack, owned by General Wireless, had returned to bankruptcy and is liquidating. The lawsuit filed in Delaware Superior Court by RadioShack's official committee of unsecured creditors says that Overland Park, Kansas-based Sprint breached its contract with RadioShack, and is seeking $500 million in damages. Sprint allegedly ignored its obligations to provide inventory and staff to RadioShack stores because of its own financial troubles. Sprint spokesman David Tovar said the company was disappointed by the creditors’ committee action and Sprint expected to defend the matter vigorously. The lawsuit alleges that in 2016, Sprint used confidential information obtained from RadioShack to open 200 competing stores near RadioShack's best locations, sinking any comeback for the electronics chain. “Sprint’s action destroyed nearly 6,000 RadioShack jobs,” said the lawsuit. The allegations stand in sharp contrast to promises made less than seven months ago by the chief executive officer of SoftBank, Sprint’s Japanese parent company, that he would create U.S. jobs. U.S. President Donald Trump made jobs the centerpiece of his election campaign. SoftBank's Masayoshi Son was among the first foreign business leaders to meet with then-President-elect Donald Trump at his New York headquarters and praised the Republican for a raft of planned deregulations. The CEO promised to invest $50 billion with the aim of hiring 50,000 people in the United States. Trump took credit for the commitment and reported in late December that Sprint had committed to bringing 5,000 jobs to the United States.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/sprint-corp-lawsuit-radioshack-idUSL1N1JQ2DH"},

The maximum tax rate charged on pension fund investment returns will be 10 percent.            Also present at the summit are the presidents of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto, and Peru, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski.

Novegil said the $1.3 billion acquisition would raise Ternium's debt to up to 1.75 times its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, a gauge of profitability known as EBITDA. The steelmaker owed 0.5 EBITDA on the first quarter. Ternium struck the deal with ThyssenKrupp AG in February to buy the money-losing Companhia Siderúrgica do Atlantico SA and is awaiting Brazil antitrust watchdog Cade's approval. Novegil also said he was working to reach an agreement with joint venture partner Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corp over the control of Brazilian steelmaker Usinas Siderúrgicas de Minas Gerais. Novegil did not elaborate on ways to end the conflict that led the partners to sue each other.

As result of a legalization measure approved by Nevada voters in November, the state will join four other U.S. states and the District of Columbia in allowing recreational sales. Authorized marijuana shops will be able to sell up to one ounce (28 grams) for recreational use by customers 21 years and older, said Stephanie Klapstein, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Taxation. Public consumption of marijuana is prohibited, and Nevada has enacted new regulations against edible forms of pot that could appeal to children, such as fruit-shaped candies infused with cannabis. Nevada is also imposing a 10 percent excise tax on pot sales in addition to the regular 4.6 percent state sales tax. Nevada has yet to finalize the exact number of stores that regulators will approve. Sixty applications were submitted from across the state, according to Klapstein, whose department is overseeing the state's pot market. Only medical cannabis dispensaries, which became legal in the state in 2015, are eligible to apply for licenses for recreational sales. Many of them are expected to open in Las Vegas, Nevada's largest city and gambling magnet.  Tens of millions of visitors per year from all over the U.S. and around the world will see firsthand that regulating marijuana works,  said Mason Tvert, a spokesman for the Marijuana Policy Project, a group that backed the November 2016 ballot measure. Voters in three other states - California, Maine and Massachusetts - have also approved marijuana legalization. In 2012, Washington and Colorado were the first states to legalize recreational marijuana, followed by Oregon and Alaska. Marijuana remains illegal under federal law. Most U.S. states allow it for medical purposes, but not for recreation. A U.S. Department of Justice spokesman in an email declined to comment on Nevada's state-sanctioned marijuana sales and added that the department is reviewing its policies on marijuana enforcement. U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions has long opposed easing marijuana restrictions. At a speech in March, he described marijuana as  only slightly less awful  than heroin and said the United States needed to discourage drug use.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/nevada-marijuana-idUSL1N1JQ2CW"},

In the second recent marketing misstep involving members of the Kardashian family, Kendall and Kylie Jenner said they had withdrawn their $125 T-shirt line from sale a day after it was launched.  These designs were not well thought out and we deeply apologize to anyone that has been upset and/or offended, especially to the families of the artists,  the Jenner sisters said in a statement.  We are huge fans of their music and it was not our intention to disrespect these cultural icons in anyway,  they added.  The move followed outrage from relatives of some of the artists, and cease and desist letters from other musicians over unauthorized use of the images.  Girls, you haven't earned the right to put your face with musical icons. Stick to what you know … lip gloss,  Sharon Osbourne, the wife of Black Sabbath frontman Ozzy Osbourne, wrote on Twitter. Violetta Wallace, the mother of Notorious B.I.G, accused the sisters of exploitation and said no one had contacted the rapper's estate for permission.

The response by Deutsche's lawyers at Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld is the second rejection by the bank for information on Trump's finances. Deutsche Bank has loaned the Trump organization millions of dollars for real-estate ventures, and five Democrats on the House of Representatives Financial Services Committee want information on Trump's finances.  We respectfully disagree with the suggestion that Deutsche Bank freely may reveal confidential financial information in response to requests from individual members of Congress,  Deutsche's counsel wrote in a letter seen by Reuters. Maxine Waters, ranking Democrat on the House of Representatives Financial Services Committee, said in an emailed response to Reuters on Thursday that she would pursue Deutsche Bank.  Trump has made it entirely clear that he has a lot to hide, and it appears that Deutsche Bank is willing to cover for him,  said California's Waters.  Efforts by Trump, his family members and associates, and Deutsche Bank to avoid scrutiny only intensify our resolve to follow the Trump money trail.” Investigations are being conducted in the United States into possible collusion between Trump's campaign team and Russia during his 2016 U.S. presidential campaign. The White House and the Kremlin have denied that there was any interference in the election. Waters and four other lawmakers first asked the bank in May to share details about Trump's real-estate business and whether Trump had financial backing from Russia. Deutsche Bank's Washington-based external counsel responded that it would not share confidential information about Trump's finances. U.S. House Democrats have argued that U.S. federal laws protecting banking customers' confidentiality did not apply to requests from Congress. A disclosure document posted on the U.S. Office of Government Ethics website earlier in June showed liabilities for Trump of at least $130 million to Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas. The Democrats do not have the power to compel Deutsche Bank to comply with their request. The Financial Services Committee has subpoena power but Republican committee members, who are in the majority, would have to agree.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/deutsche-bank-trump-idUSL1N1JQ2CR"},

Reuters could not independently verify the authenticity of the recording, and Zavala and Vice President Martin Vizcarra, who is also heard in the recording, did not respond to requests for comment. In an interview with TV channel Canal N, Vizcarra did not dispute the recording and said the remarks in it were not improper because they reflected the government's public position on the $525 million Chinchero airport contract. He said the meeting occurred on May 2. Zavala has been doubling as the country's finance minister since last week when the opposition-controlled Congress ousted previous Finance Minister Alfredo Thorne with a vote of no-confidence over accusations that he tried to pressure the comptroller to approve a controversial contract. The latest tape could renew tension between Zavala and Congress. Opposition lawmaker Hector Becerril of the right-wing party Popular Force tweeted on Thursday,  After listening to the new audio, it's imperative for Prime Minister Zavala to be summoned to Congress. He owes explanations to the country.  On Thursday in an interview on Canal N, opposition lawmaker Marco Arana of the leftist group Broad Front called for Zavala to be summoned to Congress to answer questions about the audio recording. Zavala said in February that he had recused himself from discussions about Chinchero because his sister worked at Andino Investment Holding, part of the Kuntur Wasi consortium that was awarded the Chinchero contract in the previous government. Zavala's sister later resigned from Andino. In the recording broadcast on ATV, Zavala is heard in a meeting with comptroller Edgar Alarcon speaking about the importance of moving forward with Chinchero and other public work projects.

Mergers and acquisitions in Europe rose 45 percent year-on-year to $234 billion in the second quarter, as companies bet the region's economies will bounce back, according to Thomson Reuters data released on Thursday. Global M&A; dropped 12 percent to $771 billion, however, and U.S. M&A; dropped 36 percent to $281 billion.   The EU recovery is happening and has made companies more attractive even if there are increased regulatory hurdles,  said Hernan Cristerna, global M&A; co-head at JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N).  In the second quarter, Italian toll road operator Atlantia SpA (ATL.MI) made a 16.3 billion euro ($18.64 billion) offer for Spanish peer Abertis Infraestructuras SA (ABE.MC), while chemicals companies Huntsman Corp (HUN.N) and Clariant AG (CLN.S), of the United States and Switzerland, respectively, agreed a $14 billion merger. The United States also saw some big deals, including U.S. medical equipment supplier Becton Dickinson and Co's (BDX.N) $24 billion acquisition of peer C R Bard Inc (BCR.N).  But U.S. M&A; volume, as measured by the total value of deals, was down. The number of deals stayed almost flat year-on-year, but the average size of transactions decreased.  Some U.S. companies are in wait-and-see mode because they are still seeking clarity on the tax and regulatory reforms that the Trump administration has been promising. This kind of uncertainty is a major obstacle to mega-deals,  said Bill Curtin, global head of M&A; at law firm Hogan Lovells. Coupled with high stock market valuations, the uncertainty around U.S. President Donald Trump's policy agenda reduced the appetite of many North American chief executives for major deals.  Corporates are still actively acquiring, but they are taking less risk, so there are fewer transformational deals and the mix of M&A; has shifted toward more mid-sized transactions,  said Matt McClure, head of Americas M&A; for Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N). Regulatory risks to deals closing has been another factor weighing on deals. The European Commission has been flexing its antitrust muscle, while expectations that the Trump administration will adopt a more merger-friendly stance have yet to meaningfully materialize. Nevertheless, for some companies the adverse environment offers a window to make a bold acquisitive move with little competition. For example, Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) clinched a $13.4 billion deal for U.S. grocer Whole Foods Market Inc (WFM.O) earlier this month, which has yet to trigger any rival offers.  There is a subset of companies which view the current environment as an opportunity. There is a little bit of a 'dare-to-be-great' mentality,  said Michael Boublik, chairman of Americas M&A; at Morgan Stanley (MS.N). In the Asia-Pacific region, M&A; volumes were almost flat in the second quarter at around $207 billion. Many dealmakers say  global activity could increase in the second half of the year, particularly if there is more macroeconomic certainty in the United States.  Our outlook for the second half remains positive. Economic activity is strengthening, corporate earnings are robust, and financing markets remain very attractive,  said Barclays Plc (BARC.L) Americas head of M&A; Larry Hamdan.

The Congressional Budget Office report, requested by Senate Democrats, provides a longer-term look at how the Republican plan would affect Medicaid spending as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell searches for a formula to win over the conservative and moderate elements of his Republican caucus. Republican discussions on Thursday were focused on two proposals. One, by moderates, would keep a 3.8 percent Obamacare tax on high earners' investment income, instead of repealing it as Republicans have promised. Another, by conservative Senator Ted Cruz, would let insurers offer skimpier healthcare plans if they also offer a plan choice that is Obamacare compliant. An additional $45 billion over a decade to combat the opioid crisis also is on the table, sources close to the talks told Reuters. The original draft of the Republican bill was opposed by at least nine Republican senators. McConnell can only afford to lose two of 52 Republican votes in the 100-seat Senate to pass the bill. Vice President Mike Pence was on Capitol Hill to push for the bill, meeting with Cruz and moderate Senators Susan Collins, Shelley Moore Capito and Dean Heller. All opposed the bill in its original form. The two factions did not yet seem in agreement. Senator Lisa Murkowski said discussions were continuing to see whether Cruz' proposal could be made more acceptable to moderates like herself. Conservative Senator Pat Toomey said he would be  shocked  if the Obamacare 3.8 percent tax is not repealed. Republican Governor John Kasich of Ohio, which opted to expand Medicaid under Obamacare, said the CBO's latest assessment  further validates  his concerns. The bill proposes phasing out Obamacare's Medicaid expansion between 2021 and 2024, then making deeper cuts to the program and overhauling it in 2025. The CBO estimated that under current law, Medicaid spending would grow 5.1 percent a year during the next two decades. Under the Republican Senate plan, it projected growth of just 1.9 percent a year through 2026 and about 3.5 percent per year in the subsequent 10 years. The CBO can typically only score legislation in a 10-year window, so the bill's longer-term affects had not been assessed until Thursday's report. It had earlier estimated that the Senate bill would strip coverage for 22 million Americans in the next decade.

The $6.7 billion pullback from taxable bond mutual funds marks a change of heart after the funds heavily used by retail investors inhaled tens of billions in bonds since last year. The U.S. Federal Reserve is on a path to raising interest rates from very low levels even as economic data has remained mixed. Rising rates are seen as a drag on bond fund returns. Meanwhile monetary policy officials, including European Central Bank President Mario Draghi, made comments this week implying a global turn away from ultra-easy stimulus policies. Yields on the 10-year Treasury benchmark leapt from 2.14 on Monday to 2.27 on Thursday. Riskier high-yield bond mutual funds and ETFs posted $1.7 billion in withdrawals, their worst outflows since March, the data showed.  I wouldn't be surprised if it becomes more consistent than we've seen in the past - money leaving taxable-bond funds,  said Pat Keon, Senior Research Analyst at Lipper.  It's just a question of where does it go because equity funds are distasteful for a lot of people.  Mutual fund investors cashed out a net $7.3 billion from domestic stocks. ETF investors pulled an additional $4.2 billion from funds focused on U.S. company shares, adding to the equity market's woes.  The S&P; 500 has managed a 0.5 percent gain this month despite a dramatic selloff for oil and some of the year's most high-flying technology stocks. Investors had bid up high earning growth stocks in hopes that they would continue to eek out gains in a tepid U.S. economy that is still supported by the easy monetary policy that has been in place nearly a decade after the 2007-2009 global financial crisis. Meanwhile, foreign stocks continue to find favor among U.S. investors. Japanese equity funds pulled in half a billion dollars during the latest week, their largest haul since February. Within U.S. stocks, violent rotations between sectors continue. Finance sector funds posted $1.2 billion in outflows, the most since March, even as the Fed approved large banks' plans to use extra capital for stock buybacks, dividends and other purposes beyond being a cushion against catastrophe. Healthcare funds pulled in $1.7 billion and the most cash since November 2016 as Congress aimed to pass an Obamacare replacement bill. Rate-sensitive real estate and utilities sectors posted their largest withdrawals of the year.

Both the Kremlin and the White House announced on Thursday that the pair will meet on the sidelines of the July 7-8 summit of G20 nations in Hamburg. Trump's national security adviser H.R. McMaster downplayed the significance of the meeting, one of nine such side meetings for the U.S. president over two days.  It won't be different from our discussions with any other country, really,  McMaster said.  There's no specific agenda. It's really going to be whatever the president wants to talk about.  The meeting will be fraught with difficulties for Trump.     Allegations that Russia interfered in the U.S. presidential election last year and colluded with the Republican's campaign have overshadowed the businessman's unexpected victory and dogged his first five months in office. Russia and the United States are also at odds over Ukraine, NATO expansion and the civil war in Syria where Moscow supports President Bashar al-Assad.  The United States backs rebel groups trying to overthrow Assad, and Washington angered Russia by launching missile strikes against a Syrian government air base in April in response to what the United States says was a chemical weapons attack that killed dozens of civilians. Investigation Looms Trump has frequently called for better ties with Russia but lawmakers in his own Republican Party are urging him to be wary of Moscow.  As the president has made clear, he'd like the United States and the entire West to develop a more constructive relationship with Russia but he has also made clear that we will do what is necessary to confront Russia's destabilizing behavior,  McMaster said.     U.S. intelligence agencies say Russia hacked and leaked emails of Democratic Party political groups to help Trump win the 2016 U.S. presidential election against Democrat Hillary Clinton. Russia denies the allegations and Trump says his team did not collude with Moscow.     Several congressional committees as well as the FBI are investigating Russia's role in the election and any alleged collusion by Trump's campaign. That makes the optics of the Putin meeting particularly challenging for Trump.  If there are big grins on both of their faces, that will be the picture on the front pages of every Western newspaper, as the investigation continues here,  said Heather Conley, a former State Department official in the George W. Bush White House.  I would think the president would be advised, if there is a meeting, to be very careful with his body language,  Conley told Reuters. Syria Friction Trump raised Russian hackles this week when the White House said it appeared the Syrian military was preparing to conduct a chemical weapons attack and warned that Assad and his forces would  pay a heavy price  if it did so. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov warned on Wednesday that Moscow would respond proportionately if the United States took measures against Syrian government forces.     But Lavrov added that it would  probably not be right  if Putin and Trump did not talk at the G20 summit of world economic powers.                Republican Bob Corker, the influential chairman of the Senate foreign relations committee, described the planned encounter as  just a side meeting  but said he hoped Trump would bring up problematic issues with Putin.  I would hope what he would do is hand him a list of the issues we have with their country. And I think he may well do that,  Corker told Reuters. Putin, who has served as both Russian president and prime minister, has outlasted the previous two U.S. presidents, George W. Bush and Barack Obama. Officials from those administrations say American officials initially overestimated their potential areas of cooperation with the Russian leader. Then, through a combination of overconfidence, inattention and occasional clumsiness, Washington contributed to a deep spiral in relations with Moscow, they say. Those relations reached a post-Cold War low under Trump's predecessor, Obama. In the last days of his presidency, Obama ordered the expulsion of 35 Russian suspected spies and imposed sanctions on two Russian intelligence agencies over their involvement in hacking U.S. political groups in the 2016 election. A proposed new package of sanctions on Russia in the U.S. Congress might also put curbs on Trump's ability to pursue warmer relations with Moscow.  The U.S. Senate reached an agreement on Thursday to resolve a technical issue stalling the sanctions, although the measure's fate in the House of Representatives is uncertain.

The pipeline will not be rationing space on its gasoline line during the period as it typically does when nominations exceed capacity, a Colonial spokeswoman told Reuters.  The company said last week demand on its main gasoline line that hauls about 1.3 million barrels per day (bpd) of the motor fuel was the weakest in nearly six years. The conduit, which is a vital source of supply for the southeast and populous East Coast regions, has seen demand fall amid bloated inventories in the East Coast and as Gulf coast refiners and traders increasingly choose to export barrels instead. While overall gasoline inventories fell last week, stockpiles in the East Coast, or PADD 1, increased and sit well above the five-year average.

The companies - which account for over 60 percent of China's $11 trillion gross domestic product - have entered the most challenging funding environment in years as Beijing cracks down on easy credit to contain a dangerous debt build-up. Many of the firms - mostly in the industrial, transport, wholesale, retail, catering and accommodation sectors - are already grappling with soaring costs, fierce competition and thinning profits.  The strains faced by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are expected to grow more visible as Beijing deflates a real estate bubble and eases infrastructure spending to dial back its fiscal stimulus.   Many SMEs probably won't make it this year,  said Wang Cong, manager of a struggling mid-sized logistics company in the eastern city of Zibo.   Banks have started pulling the plug, just as competition has become a lot more intense.  Central bank data shows broad M2 money supply grew 9.6 percent in May from a year earlier, the slowest since at least January 1996, when Reuters data on the series began.  Cumulatively, combined trust loans, entrusted loans and undiscounted banker's acceptances - sources of funding for shadow banking activities that largely involve SMEs - fell to 28.9 billion yuan ($4.25 billion) in May from 177 billion yuan in April.  The lack of funds is taking a toll. Business activity in the SME sector weakened for the third straight month in June to hit the lowest in 16 months, a Standard Chartered survey tracking more than 600 Chinese SMEs found. The market pressures have led to an increase in unemployment, and weaker demand is expected to keep weighing on the labor market this year, the survey noted.  Our profit has thinned to the point where I don't think any more drop could be sustainable,  said Yu Zhihao, who runs a wood wholesale business in China's northeastern port city of Tianjin and has seen his gross margins contract by a quarter in the past year. Financing Costs For state-owned enterprises, growth in financing costs on average accelerated to 5.5 percent in May from 0.5 percent in February, said Jonas Short, who heads the Beijing office at investment bank Sun Hung Kai Financial (SHKF). For smaller businesses lacking strong collateral, funding is even more expensive - if they can find it. A worker uses a chainsaw to cut timber at a woodyard in Tianjin, China June 15, 2017.Thomas Peter It's pretty clear, financial expenses have skyrocketed since the decision to increase interbank rates over the New Year,  said Short. The waning fortunes of China's SMEs come ahead of a reshuffle in the country's political leadership team late this year. SMEs employ four-fifths of the workforce and are crucial to the stability craved by Beijing.  Many SMEs appear reluctant to expand production even as the government has introduced various favorable measures such as tax cuts to support their development, said Zhang Shaoping, analyst with the government-affiliated China Association of Small- and Medium-sized Enterprises.  My feeling is the second quarter would definitely be tougher for SMEs compared to the first quarter,  Zhang said. Slideshow (10 Images)Banks' willingness to lend to SMEs fell below the no-change mark of 50 for the first time on record in June, the Standard Chartered survey found, indicating banks are more hesitant to extend credit to SMEs.  That reflects analysts' views that even though the central bank will likely provide sufficient credit to avoid a liquidity crunch, banks may still prefer lending to bigger rather than smaller companies. Hangzhou Zugeng Import & Export Co, a medium-sized fruit import company based in Shanghai, was among those SMEs to fold as banks held back support.  One former employee said she had heard the company's banks had been unnerved by a rise in corporate loan delinquencies and had stopped providing funds to companies facing tough operating conditions. A former company representative confirmed the firm had closed when contacted by phone but declined any further comment.

Currently, 50 percent of such aid must be transported on U.S.-flagged vessels. The sources said Trump is considering going as far as doubling that to 100 percent, a move likely to stir opposition from both Republicans and Democrats.  An executive order is being drafted by the White House,  one source with knowledge of discussions told Reuters, adding that it was being discussed among government lawyers. Although unlikely to have any significant effect on the $4 trillion global cargo shipping industry, the initiative touted as part of Trump's  America First  platform may slow food aid getting to millions of people and do little to create jobs, critics said. Aid groups, and members of Congress from both parties have been working for years to lower, or eliminate, the 50 percent shipping requirement. The United States, the world's largest provider of humanitarian assistance, spent about $2.8 billion on foreign food aid in 2016. About half of that is estimated to go to shipping and storage. The conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute said in a November report that shipping food aid on U.S.-flagged vessels costs 46 percent more than aid shipped at internationally competitive rates and can take as much as 14 weeks longer. Supporters say Trump's initiative would not only create new U.S. jobs in the shipping industry but that U.S.-controlled food shipments are important for national security because the U.S. fleet could be transferred to the military in case of a conflict. Critics argue the order would create few, if any, jobs. Food aid is a very small percentage of the worldwide sea cargo flow, while the security issue is moot as most cargo ships are too slow for use by the 21st century military. The costs would also be far higher by eliminating competition for shipping contracts with lower-cost international carriers, requiring more U.S. taxpayer dollars to feed fewer people, they say. A spokesman for USAID, which oversees U.S. humanitarian programs, declined to comment, referring the question to the White House. Natalie Strom, a spokeswoman for the White House said,  We don't comment on any potential EO's (executive orders) that may or may not be in the works.  Trump has submitted a budget outline that proposed steep cuts in spending on foreign aid, which accounts for just 1 percent of all U.S. spending. Members of Congress from both parties said they opposed that plan. With the world facing four potential famines, and struggles to care for millions displaced by conflicts in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan, critics have been pushing to eliminate what they see as an unnecessary regulation that already adds $50 million a year to the cost of providing aid. Tom Hart, North America executive director at The One Campaign, a non-profit group co-founded by U2's Bono to fight poverty, said the regulation would hinder getting life-saving food assistance to the people Americans are trying to help.  Millions of people could be denied the food aid they need to survive if the cargo preference requirement is doubled,  said Hart. Senator Bob Corker, the influential Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has been an especially vocal critic of the shipping requirement. He and another committee member, Democratic Senator Chris Coons, have filed legislation to ease the requirement. After hearing about the potential order, senators from both parties called senior administration officials to let them know this would not be supported in Congress, a Senate aide told Reuters.  They've been warned,  the aide added.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-trump-aid-idUSL1N1JQ2BI"},

The $6.7 billion pullback from taxable bond mutual funds marks a change of heart after the funds heavily used by retail investors inhaled tens of billions in bonds since last year. The U.S. Federal Reserve is on a path to raising interest rates from very low levels even as economic data has remained mixed. Rising rates are seen as a drag on bond fund returns. Meanwhile monetary policy officials, including European Central Bank President Mario Draghi, made comments this week implying a global turn away from ultra-easy stimulus policies. Yields on the 10-year Treasury benchmark leapt from 2.14 on Monday to 2.27 on Thursday. Riskier high-yield bond mutual funds and ETFs posted $1.7 billion in withdrawals, their worst outflows since March, the data showed.

It's just a question of where does it go because equity funds are distasteful for a lot of people.  Mutual fund investors cashed out a net $7.3 billion from domestic stocks. ETF investors pulled an additional $4.2 billion from funds focused on U.S. company shares, adding to the equity market's woes.  The S&P; 500 has managed a 0.5 percent gain this month despite a dramatic selloff for oil and some of the year's most high-flying technology stocks.

More than 50 sheep, goats and cows stood in the scorching heat of a desolate no-man's land in arid northern Kenya, as Maasai and Samburu herders negotiated their handover. Lipan Kitonga cast a critical eye over his emaciated herd, which 10 gun-toting Samburu had stolen from his home in Isiolo County, 300 kilometers (186 miles) north of Kenya's capital.  I was not around at the time,  said Kitonga, a community-based police officer, known as a police reservist, dressed in camouflage fatigues with a G3 rifle in hand.  Otherwise it would have been a different matter,  he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation, his voice still tight with anger nine days after the animal theft.  Nomadic herders in remote northern Kenya, which is awash with illegal arms, frequently raid cattle from each other and fight over scarce pasture and water, especially during droughts. A wave of violence has hit Isiolo's neighboring Laikipia region in recent months as armed herders searching for grazing have driven tens of thousands of cattle onto private farms and ranches from denuded communal land.  The livestock exchange was organized by the Northern Rangelands Trust (NRT), a charity set up in 2004 with support from donors and conservationists to reduce conflict and poverty among nomads by helping them better manage their land. Almost 300,000 people are members of NRT's 33 conservancies, which are community organizations focused on conservation, owning nearly six million acres (2.4 million hectares) of land across Kenya's north and coast. Nomads No More Drought has hit millions this year in northern Kenya, where most people live off their livestock. As Kenya's population has doubled in 25 years, nomads can no longer freely follow the rains, turning some overgrazed common lands to dust.   You have got more people, with more livestock, on less and less productive rangeland and it's a really explosive situation,  said Mike Harrison, chief executive of NRT, funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID).  The only answer to this is that everybody has to invest in improving their land.  NRT promotes rotational grazing with a sustainable number of livestock, which allows land to rest, and the reseeding of degraded areas. Zones are set aside for wildlife, people and livestock, with limited access during drought for nomadic animals from other communities.        It also helps develop new businesses - tourism, bead-making and livestock markets - so nomads are less dependent on herding. Tourism is the real money-spinner.  The most successful conservancies earn about $500,000 a year  from visitors paying daily entry fees of $50-$80, Harrison said. These earnings go into a community fund with 40 percent spent on operations, like rangers' salaries, and 60 percent on community projects, like education and health, NRT says.  Shootouts One of NRT's main achievements has been to reduce conflict, cattle rustling and poaching by funding more than 500 rangers, trained by Kenya Wildlife Service, to patrol members' land. Many are police reservists, like Kitonga, issued with rifles by the government to beef up the overstretched police. In Nasuulu, just north of Isiolo town, the Samburu, Turkana, Somali and Borana -- who have traditionally fought each other -- have come together to form one conservancy, an NRT member.   They never used to talk to each other before, but they are now working together,  said Omar Godana, Nasuulu's chairman. Elephant poaching has stopped on 35,000 hectare (86,487 acre) Nasuulu since 12 NRT-funded scouts were deployed, he said. NRT's mobile security teams work with the police and wildlife service and receive aircraft and tracker-dog backup from a nearby wildlife conservancy, Lewa. With beefed up security and strict controls on grazing, shootouts between armed herders and rangers are inevitable.  It's a killer squad,  said John Leparsanti, a Samburu herder in Laikipia who sees the crackdown on illegal grazing on NRT conservancies as a threat to his traditional way of life.   When there is a biting drought we cannot graze.  Herding is key to the identity and culture of Kenya's nomads, whose young men are initiated as warriors in colorful ceremonies where each kills a cow and drinks its blood. Their role as 'morans' is to guard the community and its animals.  Livestock provide nomads with a ready income because they can be sold quickly for cash. Pastoralists often do not have bank accounts and have high illiteracy rates as they roam over vast terrains with their cattle from a young age.  We are not ready to do business like other tribes because we believe in cows,  said Samburu politician Mathew Lempurkel.  What are we going to replace them with?  Harrison says less than 1 percent of NRT members' land is set aside exclusively for wildlife. Status Cows In remote, insecure lands, with poor roads and patchy mobile phone networks, there are no obvious alternative ways of life.   If we went to say: 'Look, you've all got to cut your livestock numbers in half, we would be laughed out the door,  said Harrison.  It's a long slow process of rethinking what the incentives might be, trying different options.  The authority of elders who used to control shared grazing land has been eroded by centralized government rule and modern education, experts say. As climate change has brought increasingly frequent and prolonged drought and less grass, herders are keeping more goats as they can browse on shrubs and young shoots, unlike cattle. The goats rip out the grass roots, further degrading the rangeland and reinforcing the vicious downwards cycle.      Some northern counties have formalized traditional land management customs in local bylaws, with the aim of giving power back to elders, in contrast to NRT's approach of supporting decision-making by conservancy boards of directors.  When you have the elders managing, there is enhanced ownership and the feeling of exclusion is not there,  said George Wamwere-Njoroge, an expert with the International Livestock Research Institute, which supports such initiatives.  ILRI is also encouraging herders to keep fewer, healthier animals, which fetch a better price at local markets, instead of trucking their cattle for 24 hours to the capital, Nairobi, where cartels control sales, he said. One solution, rarely discussed by politicians, would be to reduce the number of livestock owned by wealthy, urban elites, who keep vast herds on northern lands as a status symbol. Unlike in the past, when droughts would naturally have reduced livestock numbers, the elites ship in hay and water to keep their animals alive.   A lot of destitute pastoralists have dropped out and moved to the small trading centers and depend on relief and petty trade,  said Wamwere-Njoroge.   But the elite pastoralist animals keep on going.

Stronger and calmer markets, a brighter economic outlook in some countries, as well as the avoidance of further political shocks in several European elections helped equity raising markets recover from 2016, when worries about China's economy, the British vote to leave the European Union and commodity prices discouraged potential issuers. Companies globally issued $386.8 billion of equity in the first half of this year, up 33 percent from the same period in 2016, which was the worst since 2008. Despite the rebound, issuance remained way off the highest issuance in more than 15 years in 2015 when $519.5 billion was raised. Including some 60 initial public offerings (IPOs) and 355 follow-on offerings, U.S. companies raised $116.8 billion in equity in the first half, 46 percent more than they did in the first half of 2016.   The United States is a stand-out: it has led in all fronts including IPOs – it started with inflationary expectations but there is also optimism about tax reform and the Fed slowly raising rates while being in control of the economy,” said Achintya Mangla, head of equity capital markets (ECM) in Europe, Middle East and Africa at JP Morgan (JPM.N) which was the top bookrunner globally by proceeds.   Investors are being selective and they are very focused on after market trading. We will see more IPOs in Europe and the United States and underwriters need to remain focused and disciplined on pricing and secondary market performance,  Mangla added. More than a quarter of U.S. IPO proceeds were from the high technology sector. Snap (SNAP.N), the owner of Snapchat - a mobile photo app, remained the largest U.S. equity offering but was only the sixth biggest ECM deal in the world with European bank issues dominating. Unicredit (CRDI.MI) in the first quarter and Credit Suisse (CSGN.S) and Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) in the second tapped equity markets, cumulatively raising proceeds of more than $26 billion. For the rest of the year, the market looked to a rights issue from German pharmaceutical giant Bayer (BAYGn.DE) to help raise $19 billion worth of equity capital to finance its acquisition of U.S. seeds firm Monsanto (MON.N). Relatively, the Asia-Pacific region lagged behind with a rise in ECM volume of 7.4 percent to $95.1 billion and just one deal in the global top 10: the 30 billion yuan ($4.35 billion) convertible bond issue from China Everbright Bank in March.  European Ipo Slump IPOs in Europe declined further from 2016's slump. The oversubscribed listing of Allied Irish Banks (ALBK.I) in Dublin and London was a rare bright spot and a milestone for the Irish recovery from the economic crisis almost a decade ago.  We're certainly not seeing the return to boom times just yet. The economy in the UK and Europe is softer compared to the United States and that may create headwinds for domestic listings,  said Maegan Morrison, head of the ECM practice at law firm Hogan Lovells. Bankers said the prospect of Britain leaving the European Union unnerved some potential issuers concerned over how Brexit could impact London's position as a global financial hub.   For most of the international companies we speak with, in the past London would win as a listing venue. Now there's a genuine debate, Brexit is coming up in every single conversation as a source of uncertainty,  a senior investment banker at a top global bank in London said, speaking on condition of anonymity.   New York is the clear beneficiary for IPOs, and that's a problem for capital inflows into the UK.

A monthly measure of consumer confidence published by market research firm GfK sank to -10, weaker than a median forecast of -7 in a Reuters poll of economists.  It was the lowest reading since last July's -12, shortly after Britain voted to leave the European Union.  Strong consumer spending has propped up the economy since last June but now the twin pressures of higher prices and sluggish wage growth are squeezing household finances and adding to widespread fears of a Brexit-induced economic slowdown,  Joe Staton, head of market dynamics at GfK, said. A measure of how willing consumers are to buy expensive items slumped to +1 from +9 in May, potentially raising alarm bells for retailers. The survey chimed with another measure of consumer confidence published by polling firm YouGov earlier this week which pinned the gloomier mood on Britain's messy election outcome and a weakening of the housing market. Britain's economy initially withstood the impact of the decision to leave EU. But the growing pressure on spending power from a weaker currency that is pushing up inflation caused a sharp slowdown in growth earlier this year. Inflation is expected to breach 3 percent soon while wage growth has slowed to below 2 percent. The Bank of England thinks there will be a pick-up in investment by business and in exports which will offset much of the drag from lower spending by consumers, potentially paving the way for its first interest rate hike in a decade. Official data due to be published at 0830 GMT on Friday are expected to confirm economic growth of just 0.2 percent in the first three months of 2017 compared with the final quarter of 2016. Economists are also watching for a reading of Britain's huge services sector performed during April which, could help show whether the economy recovered any of its momentum at the start of the second quarter.

Stronger and calmer markets, a brighter economic outlook in some countries, as well as the avoidance of further political shocks in several European elections helped equity raising markets recover from 2016, when worries about China's economy, the British vote to leave the European Union and commodity prices discouraged potential issuers. Companies globally issued $386.8 billion of equity in the first half of this year, up 33 percent from the same period in 2016, which was the worst since 2008. Despite the rebound, issuance remained way off the highest issuance in more than 15 years in 2015 when $519.5 billion was raised. Including some 60 initial public offerings (IPOs) and 355 follow-on offerings, U.S. companies raised $116.8 billion in equity in the first half, 46 percent more than they did in the first half of 2016.   The United States is a stand-out: it has led in all fronts including IPOs – it started with inflationary expectations but there is also optimism about tax reform and the Fed slowly raising rates while being in control of the economy,” said Achintya Mangla, head of equity capital markets (ECM) in Europe, Middle East and Africa at JP Morgan (JPM.N) which was the top bookrunner globally by proceeds.   Investors are being selective and they are very focused on after market trading. We will see more IPOs in Europe and the United States and underwriters need to remain focused and disciplined on pricing and secondary market performance,  Mangla added. More than a quarter of U.S. IPO proceeds were from the high technology sector. Snap (SNAP.N), the owner of Snapchat - a mobile photo app, remained the largest U.S. equity offering but was only the sixth biggest ECM deal in the world with European bank issues dominating. Unicredit (CRDI.MI) in the first quarter and Credit Suisse (CSGN.S) and Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) in the second tapped equity markets, cumulatively raising proceeds of more than $26 billion. For the rest of the year, the market looked to a rights issue from German pharmaceutical giant Bayer (BAYGn.DE) to help raise $19 billion worth of equity capital to finance its acquisition of U.S. seeds firm Monsanto (MON.N). Relatively, the Asia-Pacific region lagged behind with a rise in ECM volume of 7.4 percent to $95.1 billion and just one deal in the global top 10: the 30 billion yuan ($4.35 billion) convertible bond issue from China Everbright Bank in March.  European Ipo Slump IPOs in Europe declined further from 2016's slump. The oversubscribed listing of Allied Irish Banks (ALBK.I) in Dublin and London was a rare bright spot and a milestone for the Irish recovery from the economic crisis almost a decade ago.  We're certainly not seeing the return to boom times just yet. The economy in the UK and Europe is softer compared to the United States and that may create headwinds for domestic listings,  said Maegan Morrison, head of the ECM practice at law firm Hogan Lovells. Bankers said the prospect of Britain leaving the European Union unnerved some potential issuers concerned over how Brexit could impact London's position as a global financial hub.   For most of the international companies we speak with, in the past London would win as a listing venue. Now there's a genuine debate, Brexit is coming up in every single conversation as a source of uncertainty,  a senior investment banker at a top global bank in London said, speaking on condition of anonymity.   New York is the clear beneficiary for IPOs, and that's a problem for capital inflows into the UK.

Mergers and acquisitions in Europe rose 45 percent year-on-year to $234 billion in the second quarter, as companies bet the region's economies will bounce back, according to Thomson Reuters data released on Thursday. Global M&A; dropped 12 percent to $771 billion, however, and U.S. M&A; dropped 36 percent to $281 billion.   The EU recovery is happening and has made companies more attractive even if there are increased regulatory hurdles,  said Hernan Cristerna, global M&A; co-head at JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N).  In the second quarter, Italian toll road operator Atlantia SpA (ATL.MI) made a 16.3 billion euro ($18.64 billion) offer for Spanish peer Abertis Infraestructuras SA (ABE.MC), while chemicals companies Huntsman Corp (HUN.N) and Clariant AG (CLN.S), of the United States and Switzerland, respectively, agreed a $14 billion merger. The United States also saw some big deals, including U.S. medical equipment supplier Becton Dickinson and Co's (BDX.N) $24 billion acquisition of peer C R Bard Inc (BCR.N).  But U.S. M&A; volume, as measured by the total value of deals, was down. The number of deals stayed almost flat year-on-year, but the average size of transactions decreased.  Some U.S. companies are in wait-and-see mode because they are still seeking clarity on the tax and regulatory reforms that the Trump administration has been promising. This kind of uncertainty is a major obstacle to mega-deals,  said Bill Curtin, global head of M&A; at law firm Hogan Lovells. Coupled with high stock market valuations, the uncertainty around U.S. President Donald Trump's policy agenda reduced the appetite of many North American chief executives for major deals.  Corporates are still actively acquiring, but they are taking less risk, so there are fewer transformational deals and the mix of M&A; has shifted toward more mid-sized transactions,  said Matt McClure, head of Americas M&A; for Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N). Regulatory risks to deals closing has been another factor weighing on deals. The European Commission has been flexing its antitrust muscle, while expectations that the Trump administration will adopt a more merger-friendly stance have yet to meaningfully materialize. Nevertheless, for some companies the adverse environment offers a window to make a bold acquisitive move with little competition. For example, Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) clinched a $13.4 billion deal for U.S. grocer Whole Foods Market Inc (WFM.O) earlier this month, which has yet to trigger any rival offers.  There is a subset of companies which view the current environment as an opportunity. There is a little bit of a 'dare-to-be-great' mentality,  said Michael Boublik, chairman of Americas M&A; at Morgan Stanley (MS.N). In the Asia-Pacific region, M&A; volumes were almost flat in the second quarter at around $207 billion. Many dealmakers say  global activity could increase in the second half of the year, particularly if there is more macroeconomic certainty in the United States.  Our outlook for the second half remains positive. Economic activity is strengthening, corporate earnings are robust, and financing markets remain very attractive,  said Barclays Plc (BARC.L) Americas head of M&A; Larry Hamdan.

I am a frequent buyer of steak so I can tell the quality by its colour and marbling,  said one woman on Thursday at a Beijing Walmart store. She selected a 211 yuan ($31.13) pack of newly arrived U.S. steak over her usual choice from Australia.  This looks tasty, worth a try,  she said, declining to be named. Other shoppers at the store said imported beef was superior in quality and worth its hefty price. Beef is the fastest-growing meat sector in China, outstripping stagnant demand for more widely eaten pork, with consumers seeking healthier sources of protein and adopting Western eating habits. China's beef imports hit $2.6 billion last year, making it the world's fastest-growing overseas market for the meat. Consumer excitement about the lifting of a 2003 ban due to a scare over mad cow disease looks set to help U.S. beef grab a significant share of that demand. U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue is in Beijing to mark the return of U.S. beef to China, and is expected on Friday to meet his Chinese counterpart, Agriculture Minister Han Changfu, as well as Vice Premier Wang Yang. Some of the millions who buy food online are expected to join the woman in the Walmart store as some of the first to buy U.S. beef in China in more than a decade. Social media has been buzzing for weeks with those ready to tuck into American steak.  American steak is delicious,  said one user on China's Twitter-like Weibo service.  It doesn't have the mutton smell of domestic beef.  Womai.com, owned by food giant COFCO, said it had received more than 1,605 orders for beef from U.S. meat giant Tyson by late Wednesday. JD.com, one of the country's biggest online retailers, has started pre-sales of U.S. beef ahead of the product's availability from mid-July. Online meat is typically around 10 percent cheaper than it is in stores, according to Euromonitor. Imported meat accounted for more than 30 percent of JD.com's meat sales last year, with Australian beef the top category and the most searched-for item, the company said. Still, food safety fears linger, despite Beijing's stringent import requirements. One Walmart shopper, surnamed Huang, was worried about more than beautiful marbling:  We should not only stick to foreign beef.

The companies - which account for over 60 percent of China's $11 trillion gross domestic product - have entered the most challenging funding environment in years as Beijing cracks down on easy credit to contain a dangerous debt build-up. Many of the firms - mostly in the industrial, transport, wholesale, retail, catering and accommodation sectors - are already grappling with soaring costs, fierce competition and thinning profits.  The strains faced by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are expected to grow more visible as Beijing deflates a real estate bubble and eases infrastructure spending to dial back its fiscal stimulus.   Many SMEs probably won't make it this year,  said Wang Cong, manager of a struggling mid-sized logistics company in the eastern city of Zibo.   Banks have started pulling the plug, just as competition has become a lot more intense.  Central bank data shows broad M2 money supply grew 9.6 percent in May from a year earlier, the slowest since at least January 1996, when Reuters data on the series began.  Cumulatively, combined trust loans, entrusted loans and undiscounted banker's acceptances - sources of funding for shadow banking activities that largely involve SMEs - fell to 28.9 billion yuan ($4.25 billion) in May from 177 billion yuan in April.  The lack of funds is taking a toll. Business activity in the SME sector weakened for the third straight month in June to hit the lowest in 16 months, a Standard Chartered survey tracking more than 600 Chinese SMEs found. The market pressures have led to an increase in unemployment, and weaker demand is expected to keep weighing on the labor market this year, the survey noted.  Our profit has thinned to the point where I don't think any more drop could be sustainable,  said Yu Zhihao, who runs a wood wholesale business in China's northeastern port city of Tianjin and has seen his gross margins contract by a quarter in the past year. Financing Costs For state-owned enterprises, growth in financing costs on average accelerated to 5.5 percent in May from 0.5 percent in February, said Jonas Short, who heads the Beijing office at investment bank Sun Hung Kai Financial (SHKF). For smaller businesses lacking strong collateral, funding is even more expensive - if they can find it. A worker uses a chainsaw to cut timber at a woodyard in Tianjin, China June 15, 2017.Thomas Peter It's pretty clear, financial expenses have skyrocketed since the decision to increase interbank rates over the New Year,  said Short. The waning fortunes of China's SMEs come ahead of a reshuffle in the country's political leadership team late this year. SMEs employ four-fifths of the workforce and are crucial to the stability craved by Beijing.  Many SMEs appear reluctant to expand production even as the government has introduced various favorable measures such as tax cuts to support their development, said Zhang Shaoping, analyst with the government-affiliated China Association of Small- and Medium-sized Enterprises.  My feeling is the second quarter would definitely be tougher for SMEs compared to the first quarter,  Zhang said. Slideshow (10 Images)Banks' willingness to lend to SMEs fell below the no-change mark of 50 for the first time on record in June, the Standard Chartered survey found, indicating banks are more hesitant to extend credit to SMEs.  That reflects analysts' views that even though the central bank will likely provide sufficient credit to avoid a liquidity crunch, banks may still prefer lending to bigger rather than smaller companies. Hangzhou Zugeng Import & Export Co, a medium-sized fruit import company based in Shanghai, was among those SMEs to fold as banks held back support.  One former employee said she had heard the company's banks had been unnerved by a rise in corporate loan delinquencies and had stopped providing funds to companies facing tough operating conditions. A former company representative confirmed the firm had closed when contacted by phone but declined any further comment.  Some 1.21 million privately or individually-owned business went out of business during the first quarter of the year, a jump of almost a third compared to a year earlier, data from the State Administration for Industry & Commerce (SAIC) showed.  The market is going through a quicker process of survival of the fittest,  Yu Fachang, a SAIC official said.     For those who have not shuttered, some resort to more price cuts to stay competitive.

The German automaker has agreed to spend $800 million in California and a total of $2 billion nationwide on clean car infrastructure to atone for diesel emissions cheating. Critics, including rival charging station maker ChargePoint Inc and some automakers, said VW's plans could give it a competitive advantage and ignore poorer communities where the state wants to promote clean cars. Electric car maker Tesla Inc and some other charging station makers supported VW. In a supplemental plan released on Thursday, the VW unit said it aimed to spend 35 percent of investment funds in such areas during the first $200 million, 30-month tranche. Electrify America Chief Executive Mark McNabb said by phone that the company had decided to build community charging stations, such as home and work chargers, in six disadvantaged communities, rather than five, although it did not raise the amount of money to be spent on community charging from a previous draft. It committed to spend $2-3 million on education with groups that had access to disadvantaged communities and was working on ways to open the network to owners of used electric cars. It also said that more than half of funds for stations near highways would be spent in less affluent areas. McNabb said his company is considering four different charging station companies and hoped regulators would consider the revised plan over the summer.

The Congressional Budget Office estimated that spending on the Medicaid healthcare program for the poor would be 35 percent lower than under current law in 2036 if a Republican proposal under consideration in the Senate were to become law. The CBO estimated that under current law, Medicaid spending would grow 5.1 percent a year during the next two decades. Under the Republican Senate plan, it projected growth of just 1.9 percent a year through 2026 and about 3.5 percent per year in the subsequent 10 years. Senate Democrats requested the latest CBO report to analyze the impact of the Republican healthcare bill's Medicaid cuts between 2026 and 2036. The CBO can typically only score legislation in a 10-year window. But some of the changes to Medicaid proposed by Republicans would not go into effect until 2021, with more drastic cuts and a federal overhaul of the program in 2025. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is continuing to search for a formula that would win over the conservative and moderate elements of his divided Republican caucus. Thursday's CBO report may add to the concerns of some moderates about proposed cuts to the Medicaid program.

Currently, 50 percent of such aid must be transported on U.S.-flagged vessels. The sources said Trump is considering going as far as doubling that to 100 percent, a move likely to stir opposition from both Republicans and Democrats.  An executive order is being drafted by the White House,  one source with knowledge of discussions told Reuters, adding that it was being discussed among government lawyers. Although unlikely to have any significant effect on the $4 trillion global cargo shipping industry, the initiative touted as part of Trump's  America First  platform may slow food aid getting to millions of people and do little to create jobs, critics said.  Aid groups, and members of Congress from both parties have been working for years to lower, or eliminate, the 50 percent shipping requirement. The United States, the world's largest provider of humanitarian assistance, spent about $2.8 billion on foreign food aid in 2016. About half of that is estimated to go to shipping and storage. The conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute said in a November report that shipping food aid on U.S.-flagged vessels costs 46 percent more than aid shipped at internationally competitive rates and can take as much as 14 weeks longer.     Supporters say Trump's initiative would not only create new U.S. jobs in the shipping industry but that U.S.-controlled food shipments are important for national security because the U.S. fleet could be transferred to the military in case of a conflict. Critics argue the order would create few, if any, jobs. Food aid is a very small percentage of the worldwide sea cargo flow, while the security issue is moot as most cargo ships are too slow for use by the 21st century military.   The costs would also be far higher by eliminating competition for shipping contracts with lower-cost international carriers, requiring more U.S. taxpayer dollars to feed fewer people, they say. A spokesman for USAID, which oversees U.S. humanitarian programs, declined to comment, referring the question to the White House.  Natalie Strom, a spokeswoman for the White House said,  We don't comment on any potential EO's (executive orders) that may or may not be in the works.  Trump has submitted a budget outline that proposed steep cuts in spending on foreign aid, which accounts for just 1 percent of all U.S. spending. Members of Congress from both parties said they opposed that plan. With the world facing four potential famines, and struggles to care for millions displaced by conflicts in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan, critics have been pushing to eliminate what they see as an unnecessary regulation that already adds $50 million a year to the cost of providing aid. Tom Hart, North America executive director at The One Campaign, a non-profit group co-founded by U2's Bono to fight poverty, said the regulation would hinder getting life-saving food assistance to the people Americans are trying to help.      Millions of people could be denied the food aid they need to survive if the cargo preference requirement is doubled,  said Hart. Senator Bob Corker, the influential Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has been an especially vocal critic of the shipping requirement. He and another committee member, Democratic Senator Chris Coons, have filed legislation to ease the requirement.  After hearing about the potential order, senators from both parties called senior administration officials to let them know this would not be supported in Congress, a Senate aide told Reuters.  They've been warned,  the aide added. Reporting by Lesley Wroughton and Patricia Zengerle; Editing by Andrew Hay","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-aid-exclusive-idUSKBN19K33S"},

Nearly one in five suspected cases of skin cancer are likely diagnosed as more advanced than they really are, researchers found. Similarly, nearly one in five are likely diagnosed as less severe when they're actually more severe.  The diagnosis is made by a human,  said lead author Dr. Joann Elmore, of the University of Washington School of Medicine in Seattle.  There is no molecular marker or machine that will tell us what the diagnosis is.  Doctors who analyze and interpret biopsy samples are called pathologists. Elmore said pathologists are not to blame for inconsistent results, however. The cases tend to be difficult to interpret.  I had my own skin biopsy about a decade ago,  she said.  I ended up getting three different interpretations from three different people.   I realized this was an area I wanted to study and quantify,  she said. Skin cancer is the most common form of cancer in the United States, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The deadliest form of skin cancer in known as melanoma.  More than 76,500 people in the U.S. were diagnosed with melanoma skin cancer in 2014, according to the CDC. Nearly 9,500 people died of it that year. Skin cancer is diagnosed after doctors take a sample of suspicious-looking skin from a patient. The sample is then sent to a lab where a pathologist looks at thin slices of the skin under a microscope to see if there are any signs of cancer. If cancer is found, the pathologists assigns it a stage, ranging from 1 to 5, with stage 5 being a cancer that has likely spread throughout the body. For the new study, the researchers used 240 skin samples broken into sets of 36 or 48. The sets were then sent to 187 pathologists in 10 states for diagnoses. The same pathologists were asked to review the same set of slides at least eight months later. For the earliest melanoma, known as stage 1, about 77 percent of pathologists issued the same diagnoses in both phases of the study. Similarly, about 83 percent of pathologists issued the same diagnoses twice for the most advanced melanoma cases. Pathologists were less likely to confirm their diagnoses during the study's second phase for melanomas in stage 2 through 4, according to the results in The BMJ. The researchers also assembled a panel of three experienced pathologists to review the cases. The proportion of diagnoses the panel agreed with varied from 25 percent for stage 2 to 92 percent for stage 1. Overall, the researchers say, if real-world melanoma diagnoses were reviewed by such an expert panel, only about 83 percent would be confirmed.  They estimate that 8 percent of real-life cases are likely assigned too high a stage. About 9 percent of cases are assigned too low a stage.  Thankfully most of the biopsies are not of invasive melanoma,  said Elmore. Dr. Ashfaq Marghoob, a dermatologist with Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City, said the results show that pathologists have high certainty when diagnosing biopsies that fall on the extremes of the stages.  All the in-between cases, there is a potential you may waver,  said Marghoob, who wasn't involved with the new study.  This subjectivity has long been understood and recognized by both dermatologists and pathologists and has been demonstrated in previous studies,  said Dr. Jennifer DeFazio, who is also a dermatologist at Memorial Sloan-Kettering and was also not involved with the new study. Marghoob said the pathologist may diagnose a skin sample differently based on how they're feeling that day or any number of factors.  For me, it’s a study to (remind doctors that) pathology is not an exact science,  said Marghoob.

The USDA's report showed a record number of hogs for the March-May period, but the results were within analysts' forecasts.                  July         ended 1.550 cents per pound higher at 89.475 cents, and hit a fresh high of 89.650 cents. August         finished 1.275 cents higher at 80.750 cents, and above the 20-day moving average of 80.378 cents.     Hog futures received an added boost from surprising cash price strength, despite plants scheduled to close during the U.S. Fourth of July holiday.                  Solid profits for packers motivated them to line up hogs for what could be a big post-Saturday holiday slaughter, a trader said.     Retailers may buy small amounts of pork until they determine  how much of it moved during the holiday, he said.                       MAINLY HIGHER LIVE CATTLE     Most live cattle contracts at the CME gained, led by technical buying and futures' discounts to initial cash prices, said traders.

Most actively traded August         ended 0.875 cent higher at 116.500 cents, and above the 10-day moving average of 116.050 cents. October         finished 1.325 cents higher at 114.975 cents.     On Thursday, a small number of market-ready, or cash, cattle in the U.S. Plains brought $119 to $120 per cwt, compared with $118 to $123 last week, said feedlot sources.     Packing plant holiday shutdowns and seasonally slumping wholesale beef demand weakened most cash returns so far this week, said traders and analysts.                  Market bulls believe impressive packer profits and fewer animals for sale than last week might underpin prices for unsold cattle.                   Technical buying, buy stops and live cattle futures advances lifted CME feeder contracts        for a second straight session.

RadioShack emerged from bankruptcy in 2015 with a deal to co-brand about 1,400 stores with Sprint, which was meant to help the telecoms provider better compete with larger rivals AT&T; Corp and Verizon Communications Inc. However, by early 2017 RadioShack, owned by General Wireless, had returned to bankruptcy and is liquidating. The lawsuit filed in Delaware Superior Court by RadioShack's official committee of unsecured creditors says that Overland Park, Kansas-based Sprint breached its contract with RadioShack, and is seeking $500 million in damages. Sprint allegedly ignored its obligations to provide inventory and staff to RadioShack stores because of its own financial troubles. Sprint spokesman David Tovar said the company was disappointed by the creditors’ committee action and Sprint expected to defend the matter vigorously. A screen shows a Sprint logo above the floor of the New York Stock Exchange shortly before the opening bell in New York, U.S., June 27, 2017.Lucas JacksonThe lawsuit alleges that in 2016, Sprint used confidential information obtained from RadioShack to open 200 competing stores near RadioShack's best locations, sinking any comeback for the electronics chain. “Sprint’s action destroyed nearly 6,000 RadioShack jobs,” said the lawsuit. The allegations stand in sharp contrast to promises made less than seven months ago by the chief executive officer of SoftBank, Sprint’s Japanese parent company, that he would create U.S. jobs. U.S. President Donald Trump made jobs the centerpiece of his election campaign.  SoftBank's Masayoshi Son was among the first foreign business leaders to meet with then-President-elect Donald Trump at his New York headquarters and praised the Republican for a raft of planned deregulations. The CEO promised to invest $50 billion with the aim of hiring 50,000 people in the United States.  Trump took credit for the commitment and reported in late December that Sprint had committed to bringing 5,000 jobs to the United States.

In what he called a policy of  energy dominance,  Trump re-branded efforts to export liquefied natural gas (LNG) to markets in Eastern Europe and Asia that had been set in motion during the previous presidential administration. The United States also will offer to export coal to Ukraine, where energy consumers often have suffered from cuts in natural gas supply by Russia.  We are here today to unleash a new American energy policy,  Trump said at an event at the Department of Energy attended by oil and coal executives and union members who build pipelines.  We will export American energy all around the world.  Trump plans to promote U.S. LNG exports at a meeting next week in Warsaw with a dozen leaders from central and eastern Europe, a region heavily reliant on Russian supplies. Trump then will meet Russian President Vladimir Putin on the sidelines of a Group of 20 summit in Germany, in the first meeting between the two leaders, coming amid rising tensions over interference in the 2016 U.S. election.  After decades of being a major importer of natural gas, the United States is set to become a net exporter of gas later this year or in 2018 thanks to the boom in fracking in states such as Texas and Pennsylvania.  There is currently one operating U.S. LNG exporting facility in Sabine Pass, Louisiana, with four others currently under construction that are expected to become operational between 2018 and 2020. As the United States aims to boost LNG exports, it will  compete for markets with Australia, Qatar and Russia, other major gas producers. U.S. crude oil exports have also risen after former president Barack Obama signed a law in 2015 allowing the shipments. 'Hell of a Lot More Friends' U.S. President Donald Trump delivers remarks during an 'Unleashing American Energy' event at the Department of Energy in Washington, U.S., June 29, 2017.Carlos BarriaWhile many of Trump's opponents have said his plan to pull the United States out of the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate has the potential to harm the country's relations around the world,  Energy Secretary Rick Perry said at the event that energy exports will strengthen ties with allies.  The United States is in a position  to be able to clearly create a hell of a lot more friends by being able to deliver to them energy and not being held hostage by some countries, Russia in particular,  Perry said. Whether it is sending LNG to Poland or Ukraine,  the entirety of the EU totally get it that if we can lay in American LNG ... we can be able to have an alternative to Russia,  for natural gas sales to Europe, Perry said. Slideshow (2 Images)Earlier this month, Cheniere Energy Inc (LNG.A) delivered the first U.S. cargoes of LNG to Poland and the Netherlands. The Energy Department on Thursday approved additional LNG exports from the Lake Charles project in Louisiana, which is under development. Trump announced plans to offer coal exports to Ukraine, as well as lift restrictions on U.S. lending for coal projects overseas.  Ukraine already tells us they need millions and millions of metric tons (of coal),  he said.  Right now, there are many other places that need it too and we want to sell it to them and to everyone else all over the globe who need it.  The Trump administration will launch a review of the ailing nuclear power industry, which has experienced a slew of closures due to stagnant electricity demand and low natural gas prices. Trump's 2018 budget included $120 million for addressing nuclear waste at Nevada's Yucca Mountain and other projects, but most of the state's politicians oppose that project. In addition, the State Department issued a permit for a NuStar Logistics LP for its New Burgos Pipeline oil product pipeline from the United States to Mexico with a capacity of up to 180,000 barrels per day.  In 2016, the United States exported about 879,000 barrels of petroleum products daily to Mexico, more than any other country, according to the Energy Department. For the year, the United States exported 4.7 million barrels a day of products – including gasoline, diesel and other refined products – around the world, making it the world’s largest exporter of refined petroleum products.

Ng, 69, who has pleaded not guilty, has been accused of funneling roughly $2 million of suspect payments to John Ashe, a former General Assembly president and ambassador from Antigua and Barbuda, and Francis Lorenzo, a former deputy U.N. ambassador from the Dominican Republic. Prosecutors said Ng hoped his bribes would attract support for his Sun Kian Ip Group to build a multibillion-dollar center that would host an annual gala for the U.N. Office for South-South Cooperation, which works with developing countries.  This case is about the defendant's effort to corrupt the United Nations to get what he wanted,  Assistant U.S. Attorney Douglas Zolkind told jurors during his opening statement.  He decided to cheat. He paid bribes to get an unfair advantage.  Tai Park, a lawyer for Ng, countered that it was actually U.N. ambassadors who sought Ng's help in financing the center and getting it built, through a public-private partnership.  He did not bribe anyone, not a single cent,  Park said.  It is a case about philanthropy. ... He openly and transparently gave financial support in every way he could for five years.  The trial could focus both on China's dealings with the United Nations, and on defense contentions that Ng's prosecution is a political ploy by the U.S. government to curb China's influence over developing countries. Ng has sat on the Chinese government's Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and in the 1990s was implicated but not charged in a fundraising scandal involving U.S. President Bill Clinton's re-election bid. It took more than three days to find jurors for the possible four- to six-week trial in federal court in Manhattan, overseen by U.S. District Judge Vernon Broderick. Ng, who will hear testimony through a translator, has been free on $50 million bail, and allowed to live under 24-hour guard in a luxury Manhattan apartment. Six others were charged, including Jeff Yin, who Zolkind called Ng's  right-hand man  and who has entered a guilty plea. Lorenzo pleaded guilty to bribery and money laundering, and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors. He is expected to be a key witness against Ng. Ashe was also charged, but died at home last June after dropping a barbell on his neck.

Responsibility for examining the environmental impact of projects on federally-regulated land is shared between three separate entities, a system the Liberal government says the public does not trust. Plans released on Thursday mean the much-criticized national energy regulator would lose its power to assess natural resource projects. Aboriginal and environmental protesters currently trying to block major pipelines complained the National Energy Board (NEB)is too close to the industry.  This is all about rebuilding public trust in how we make  decisions on major projects that are important to our economy,  said an official who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the press. The official said Ottawa was currently thinking about giving overall responsibility for probes to the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency. The government would retain final responsibility for deciding the fate of a project. Anna Johnston of the West Coast Environmental Law group said that while the plan had positive aspects, it meant the government retained too much power.  Cabinet gets to make behind closed doors some decision that basically pits short-term economic gains against environmental harms and the environment almost always loses,  she said by phone. Protests last year forced Ottawa to veto one pipeline from Alberta's oil sands to the Pacific Coast and are dragging out study of another line to the Atlantic. Canada needs to get its landlocked crude to its east and west coasts to avoid pipeline bottlenecks that leave oil trading at a discount.         Under the plans, the new assessment body would pay more attention to the long-term implications of a project and the views of aboriginals as well as allowing public comments much earlier in the process. The proposals would have little immediate impact on the energy sector. Existing projects, such as TransCanada Corp's (TRP.TO) proposed Energy East pipeline from Alberta to the Atlantic Coast, will be assessed by the NEB under current rules. The government plans to introduce draft legislation later this year to implement the changes and hopes they will become law in 2018. NEB spokeswoman Rebecca Taylor said the board supported the government's work to modernize the approach to assessments. Reuters reported last year that the government would consider stripping the NEB of sole oversight for projects.

The House voted 228-195 to pass the  No Sanctuary for Criminals Act  that would withhold some federal grants to so-called  sanctuary city  jurisdictions that do not comply with certain federal immigration laws. By a vote of 257-167, the chamber also passed  Kate's law  to increase penalties for illegal immigrants who return to the United States. It is named for Kate Steinle, who was shot dead in San Francisco in 2015. An illegal immigrant who had been deported five times was charged with her murder. Both bills will need approval from the Senate to become law. Trump's Republicans control both chambers. But Democrats assailed the measures as fear-mongering.  Although people who illegally re-enter the country do so to reunite with their families, or to flee violence or persecution, this bill considers them all dangerous criminals who deserve lengthy prison sentences,  Democratic Representative Jerrold Nadler said during debate on  Kate's Law.  During the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump demanded action against sanctuary cities, which provide some protection for illegal immigrants under laws that limit how much cooperation local police may have with federal immigration authorities. The  No Sanctuary for Criminals Act  prohibits sanctuary cities from adopting policies that restrict police officers from asking individuals about their immigration status or the immigration status of others.

In a defiant speech to parliament a week before she will host a summit of the world's top economic powers in Hamburg, the northern port city where she was born, Merkel did not mention Trump by name but said global problems could not be solved with protectionism and isolation. Her remarks raised the prospect of an open clash with Trump at the summit. She later met with European G20 leaders who promised to present a united front in Hamburg, while making clear they preferred compromise to conflict.  These will not be easy talks,  Merkel said.  The differences are obvious and it would be wrong to pretend they aren't there. I simply won't do this.  The G20 summit will be held a little over a month after a G7 summit in Sicily exposed deep divisions between other western countries and Trump on climate change, trade and migration. A short while later, Trump announced he was pulling the United States out of a landmark agreement to combat climate change reached in 2015 in Paris. Ahead of the G20 summit, Trump's administration has threatened to take punitive trade measures against China, including introducing tariffs on steel imports. This has made for an unusually tense atmosphere before the summit and German officials acknowledge they have little idea what the final communique will look like. Asked about Merkel's comments, Trump's national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, said the U.S. relationship with Germany was  as strong as ever  and played down the discord.  Of course there are going to be differences in relations with any country, and we'll talk frankly about those differences. The president enjoys those conversations,  McMaster told reporters. The German hosts face a difficult challenge. Along with Trump, Russia's Vladimir Putin and Turkey's Tayyip Erdogan will be attending. All have strained relations with Merkel and other European leaders. The summit, in a convention center in the heart of Hamburg, could also be disrupted by tens of thousands of protesters expected to descend on the city of 1.7 million. Existential Challenge Merkel said she was  more determined than ever  to make the Paris accord a success since Trump's decision to pull out, calling climate change an  existential challenge .  We cannot wait until every last person on Earth has been convinced of the scientific proof,  she said.  Anybody who believes the problems of the world can be solved with isolationism and protectionism is making a big mistake,  Merkel said. Trump looks forward to discussing his economic rationale for quitting the deal during his G20 meetings, said Gary Cohn, his top economic adviser.  He’s going to ask for a fair and level playing field. We cannot be in a position where the United States is cutting and cutting emissions while others continue to grow,  Cohn told reporters. French President Emmanuel Macron, in Berlin for the meeting of EU leaders, which included the prime ministers of Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and Britain, said he hoped the United States would  return to reason  on climate. But he also stressed that it made little sense to try to isolate Trump in Hamburg.  The relationship with the United States is a long-term one and it is deep,  Macron said.  I believe we must continue an intense dialogue with the United States because of these ties which are historic and enduring.  At Macron's invitation, Trump will visit Paris a week after the July 7-8 G20 summit for Bastille Day celebrations. They spoke by phone on Tuesday and agreed to work together to respond to any new chemical attacks from the Syrian government. Donald Tusk, the former Polish prime minister who chairs summits of EU leaders, said in Berlin that European countries would speak with one voice in Hamburg, defending the rules-based international order that Trump has called into question.

Last week, Haldane surprised financial markets by saying he was likely to vote for higher borrowing costs this year, adding to speculation about the first BoE rate hike in a decade.  We need to look seriously at the possibility of raising interest rates to keep the lid on those cost of living increases,  Haldane told the BBC during a visit to Wales.  For now we are happy with where the rates are, we need to be vigilant for what happens next.  British inflation is at its highest level in nearly four years at 2.9 percent, tightening the squeeze on consumers who now face the added worry of political uncertainty after this month's inconclusive election. The pay of workers has begun to lag behind inflation again after a decade of mostly falling spending power, something BoE Governor Mark Carney has said needs to improve before he would consider a rate hike. Carney also wants to see the impact of the Brexit process on Britain's economy in the coming months.  Haldane told BBC television that low productivity growth was one of the biggest contributing causes to lack of pay growth. Only between 1 and 5 percent of firms were  high-innovation  and  the root cause of the stagnation in productivity and pay is that long lower tail of firms. They're taking the low-productivity road,  he said. Haldane said in a separate interview on Thursday that interest rates needed to be set in a way which minimized the risk of persistently high inflation.  First and foremost, we need to set our interest rate policy to prevent those higher inflation rates becoming entrenched,  Haldane told the Guardian newspaper. Haldane said that in addition to breaching the bank's inflation target of 2.0 percent another reason high inflation was a concern was because of its impact on the poorest. This  is having big and serious consequences for those on the lowest incomes in society and that came across loud and clear today,  Haldane said.

The Security Council has failed to even take minimal steps to respond to these violations,  Haley told a council briefing on Iran.  We must ... show Iran that we will not tolerate their egregious flaunting of U.N. resolutions.  Most U.N. sanctions were lifted 18 months ago under a deal Iran made with key world powers to curb its nuclear program. But Iran is still subject to an arms embargo and other restrictions, which are not technically part of the nuclear agreement. U.N. political affairs chief Jeffrey Feltman briefed the council on Thursday on Secretary-General Antonio Guterres' third six-monthly report on the implementation of the remaining sanctions and restrictions, enshrined in resolution 2231.   The secretary-general's report makes clear that Iran is in violation of the Security Council resolution 2231 and so the question becomes 'what is the Security Council going to do about it?'  Haley said.  No council members have proposed taking any action against Iran. Diplomats say veto-powers Russia and China were unlikely to agree to more measures. Russia on Thursday questioned some of the findings of Guterres' report.  Feltman told the council that in relation to a weapons seizure by the French Navy in the northern Indian Ocean in March 2016, the United Nations was  confident that the weapons seized are of Iranian origin and were shipped from Iran.  The report also looked at Iran's Jan. 29 launch of a ballistic missile and noted there was no consensus within the Security Council on how the launch related to resolution 2231.  I call upon the Islamic Republic of Iran to avoid such ballistic missile launches, which have the potential to increase tensions,  Guterres said in the report. A year ago Guterres' predecessor Ban Ki-moon described ballistic missile launches by Iran as  not consistent with the constructive spirit  of the nuclear deal. Under the U.N. resolution, Iran is  called upon  to refrain from work on ballistic missiles designed to deliver nuclear weapons for up to eight years. Some states argue that language does not make it obligatory. U.S. President Donald Trump's administration is reviewing the nuclear deal - agreed to under President Barack Obama - and Haley said that  until that review is completed we will comply with our commitments and we expect Iran to do the same.

Trump, who often decries what he calls  fake news  in the American media and who this week attacked CNN, the New York Times and the Washington Post, took fierce aim on Thursday at the hosts of the MSNBC program  Morning Joe,  Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski. The Republican president called Brzezinski, a journalist and daughter of former White House national security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski,  low I.Q. Crazy Mika  and said she was  bleeding badly from a face-lift  when she visited his Mar-A-Lago estate around New Year's Eve. He referred to former Republican U.S. Congressman Scarborough as  Psycho Joe.  Trump is known for his prolific Twitter habit, which includes mocking attacks on critics and rivals, but his tweets on Thursday drew a particularly strong response.  It's a sad day for America when the president spends his time bullying, lying and spewing petty personal attacks instead of doing his job,  MSNBC's communications office said on Twitter.  The  Morning Joe  program broadcast live telephone interviews with Trump during the 2016 presidential race, but its hosts have turned increasingly critical of him since he took office in January. On Thursday's show, Brzezinski excoriated the Trump administration and said its officials should not act  lobotomized  because they are scared of the president. Comcast Corp owns NBCUniversal, MSNBC's parent company. Lawmakers in both parties rebuked Trump.  I don't see that as an appropriate comment,  Republican House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said of Trump's tweets, saying they do not help improve civility in Washington. The tweets represent  what is wrong with American politics, not the greatness of America,  said Republican Senator Lindsey Graham. Republican senator Ben Sasse called Trump's remarks  beneath the dignity of your office.  MSNBC's Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski arrive for the annual White House Correspondents' Association dinner in Washington April 25, 2015.Jonathan ErnstNancy Pelosi, the top Democrat in the House of Representatives, on Twitter called Trump's tweets  sexist, an assault on the freedom of the press & an insult to all women.     At a briefing, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders called it a  false narrative  to portray Trump's remarks as  an attack on a woman  rather than on a critic, adding,  What about the constant attacks that he receives?   He's not going to sit back and get attacked by the liberal media, Hollywood elites. And when they hit him, he's going to hit back,  Sanders said.  I don't think it's a surprise to anybody that he fights fire with fire.  U.S. President Donald Trump talks to the media during his meeting with immigration crime victims at the White House in Washington, U.S., June 28, 2017.Yuri GripasAttacks on Media The tweets created an uproar in Washington and a distraction as Republican senators tried to bridge differences within the party and agree on major healthcare legislation. A wealthy businessman and former reality TV star with no previous experience in government, Trump has been quick to respond to criticism of his presidency, lashing out at the media for its coverage of probes into potential collusion between his campaign team and Russia, and other matters. He has sometimes singled out individual journalists, including a high-profile attack while he was running for office on former Fox News and current NBC journalist Megyn Kelly. That included a comment about  blood coming out of her wherever,  which was widely interpreted as a reference to menstruation. Trump has been criticized in the past for his comments about women. He attacked Kelly after she asked him during a presidential debate about his previous references to some women as  fat pigs, dogs, slobs and disgusting animals.  Trump apologized last October, just before the election, after a 2005 video surfaced in which he said he could grab women by their genitals whenever he wanted because he was a star. Trump has been critical before of the  Morning Joe  hosts, but Thursday's attack was especially harsh. Scarborough and Brzezinski are engaged to be married. During the January meeting at the Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, Trump offered to host their wedding and even to officiate it, the two said in an interview in Vanity Fair published in May.

In a policy Trump calls  energy dominance,  he rebranded efforts to export liquefied natural gas (LNG) to markets in Eastern Europe and Asia that had been set in motion during the previous administration. The United States also will offer to export coal to Ukraine, where energy consumers have suffered from cuts in natural gas supply by Russia.  We are here today to unleash a new American energy policy,  Trump said at an event at the Department of Energy attended by oil and coal executives and union members who build pipelines.  We will export American energy all around the world.  After decades of being a major importer of natural gas, the United States is set to become a net exporter of gas by 2018 thanks to the boom in fracking in states like Texas and Pennsylvania. Trump plans to promote U.S. natural gas exports at a meeting next week in Warsaw with a dozen leaders from central and eastern Europe, a region heavily reliant on Russian supplies. As the United States aims to boost LNG exports, it will compete for markets with Australia, Qatar and Russia, which are also major producers of gas. While many of Trump's opponents have said the plan to pull the United States out of the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate has the potential to harm the country's relations around the world, Energy Secretary Rick Perry said at the event that energy exports will strengthen ties with allies. The United States is in a position  to be able to clearly create a hell of a lot more friends by being able to deliver to them energy and not being held hostage by some countries, Russia in particular,  Perry said. Whether it is sending LNG to Poland or Ukraine,  the entirety of the EU totally get it that if we can lay in American LNG ... we can be able to have an alternative to Russia,  for natural gas sales to Europe, Perry said. Earlier this month, Cheniere Energy Inc delivered the first U.S. cargoes of LNG to Poland and the Netherlands. The Energy Department on Thursday approved additional LNG exports from the Lake Charles project in Louisiana, which is under construction. Trump announced plans to offer coal exports to Ukraine, as well as lift restrictions on U.S. lending for coal projects overseas.  Ukraine already tells us they need millions and millions of metric tons (of coal). Right now, there are many other places that need it too and we want to sell it to them and to everyone else all over the globe who need it,  Trump said. The Trump administration will launch a review of the ailing nuclear power industry, which has experienced a slew of closures due to stagnant electricity demand and low natural gas prices. Trump's 2018 budget included $120 million for addressing nuclear waste at Nevada's Yucca Mountain and other projects, but most of the state's politicians oppose that project. In addition, the State Department issued a permit for a NuStar Logistics LP for its New Burgos Pipeline oil product pipeline from the United States to Mexico with a capacity of up to 180,000 barrels per day.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-trump-energy-idUSL1N1JQ1X4"},

Declining production of oil, a major export, has left the government increasingly short of cash, and lack of everything from food to medical equipment is hitting vulnerable groups like the elderly and children particularly hard.   Becerra's mother, Judith Bront, still cries as she discusses her son's death.  Samuel has had chronic renal failure since birth,  said Bront, 53,  He had been receiving dialysis for nine years, and this had never happened.  A dozen other children have the same infection, which doctors traced back to dialysis machines that were improperly maintained due to lack of resources, according to Belén Arteaga, head of the hospital's kidney unit. Surveys conducted in October by Catholic non-profit organization Caritas in poor sectors of Venezuela's four most populous states found that 48 percent of children younger than 5 were malnourished. By April, that figure had risen to 56 percent. Those at high risk of death from malnutrition increased to 11.4 percent of the sample from 8 percent in that time, the surveys showed. Many treatments at J.M. de los Rios are available only because of private donations, according to parents and doctors. Parents routinely clean the rickety rooms, and there is no drinking water. A survey earlier this year by Venezuela's opposition-led Congress showed that nine of the country's 10 main hospitals did not have adequate diagnostic facilities, such as X-ray machines and laboratories, and 64 percent did not offer food to the patients. Neither Venezuela's Information Ministry nor the Health Ministry responded to requests for comment. Infant Mortality Of the young patients, infants suffer most. A girl lays on a bed at the  J.M. de los Rios  Children Hospital in Caracas, Venezuela June 22, 2017. Picture taken June 22, 2017.Marco BelloLast year 31 Venezuelan infants died every day on average.  Many were victims of diarrhea, bacterial infections and other diseases that, according to the local pediatric society, could have been prevented or easily treated.  There are vaccines and antibiotics available, but Venezuela is so lacking that these illnesses are coming back,  said Dr. Huniades Urbina, president of the Venezuelan Society of Childhood and Pediatrics. Deaths of babies younger than 1 year old jumped 30 percent in Venezuela in 2016, according to government figures. That is a stark contrast to declines across Latin America. Critics blame the problems on strict currency and price controls that reduce incentives to produce food and restrict imports. The government says the opposition and Washington are waging an  economic war  against it.  Slideshow (7 Images)Scavenging Caritas found that Venezuela's highest rate of malnutrition was in the La Guajira region of the western state of Zulia, on the arid and volatile Colombian border. In Caracolito, a tiny settlement of three dirty and crumbling houses containing a total of some 30 people, a woman scavenged for food for her 6-month-old boy at a garbage dump near their home. The child was recovering from a weeks-long stay in a nearby hospital, where he overcame chronic malnutrition.  His brother had died in March from the condition.   We were told to take vitamins but couldn't find them,  said their mother, Lideibis Bracho, who is 26 and unemployed.  We went to search in Colombia, but they're too expensive.  Susana Raffalli, a nutritional coordinator at Caritas, said the health crisis was catastrophic.       It's not normal for you to go to a community, weigh 100 children and have 30 of them close to dying,  Raffalli said.     The government has been slow to publish data, and the previous health minister was fired shortly after the publication of recent infant mortality figures.  Back at the J.M. De Los Rios hospital in Caracas, double the number of children have come in for malnutrition-related issues this year, compared with all of 2016, according to Raffalli. One mother caressed her son, who was suffering from malnutrition, pneumonia, macrocephaly and a severe lack of calcium.  He's nine months old, and he looks like a two-month-old,  said Marisela Huertas, 39.  I was told to give him whole milk, but I can't find it.

The government of President Nicolas Maduro said Oscar Perez, a strapping pilot, diver and parachutist, was responsible for firing shots and lobbing grenades on the Interior Ministry and the Supreme Court after hijacking the helicopter. In a social media video, Perez said he was fighting a tyrannical, vile government. Perez, 36, produced and starred in a 2015 Venezuelan action movie called  Suspended Death  about the rescue of a kidnapped businessman, which includes scenes of him firing a rifle from a helicopter and emerging from water in scuba gear.   He has an unusually public profile for the usually tight-lipped and secretive investigative police.  Perez has given interviews about his film and maintained a colorful Instagram feed with images of him riding horseback in combat gear, scuba-diving with rifles and pistols, and jumping out of a helicopter with a dog.  I'm a man who goes out into the streets without knowing whether I'll return home,  Perez told a local television network in an interview about the film in 2015. The movie glorifies Venezuela's investigative police as they stage a complex and action-packed rescue using improbably futuristic technology. Asked what inspired him to make the movie, he said a conversation with a young delinquent led him to believe that movies could help change minds.   (I asked myself) what can we do to create a positive idea, to be a weapon against delinquency? That's how 'Suspended Death' came to be,  said Perez in another TV interview.

Picture taken March 1, 2015.Christian VeronReuters was unable to immediately get comment from Perez.      Interior Minister Nestor Reverol said on Wednesday he had requested an Interpol alert for Perez's capture. Target Practice Perez's action came during a major national crisis as hundreds of thousands of people have taken to the streets in recent months calling for an end to Maduro's presidency, amid food shortages, a collapsing currency and soaring inflation. Slideshow (2 Images)Critics accuse Maduro of creating a dictatorship by stifling dissent, using security forces to limit the right to protest and  arbitrarily jailing demonstrators. Maduro dismisses the protests as a U.S.-backed attempt to overthrow him.  On Tuesday evening, Perez unfurled a banner from the helicopter with the word,  Freedom!  Though he supposedly claimed to be representing a coalition of disaffected security and civilian officials, there was no immediate evidence that he had further backing.  In a 2016 video on Perez's Instagram feed, he stands with his back to a mannequin target and successfully shoots it with the help of a small makeup mirror for aim. He also appeared in several public service videos including one in which a police officer takes a bribe from a driver he has pulled over, only for the driver to later kill the officer's son. Perez at the end of video looks into the camera and says  Corruption affects all of us. Denounce it.  His acting experience and his theatrical photos have spurred opposition criticism that Tuesday's incident, which did not include any reports of injuries or deaths, may have been staged by Maduro as an excuse to clamp down on adversaries.

In extraordinary scenes over Caracas around sunset on Tuesday, the stolen helicopter fired shots at the Interior Ministry and dropped grenades on the Supreme Court, both viewed by Venezuela's opposition as bastions of support for a dictator. Nobody was injured. Officials said special forces were seeking Oscar Perez, 36, a police pilot named as the mastermind of the raid by the helicopter that carried a banner saying  Freedom!  In 2015, Perez co-produced and starred in  Death Suspended,  an action film in which he played the lead role as a government agent rescuing a kidnapped businessman. There was no sign on Wednesday of Perez, whom officials condemned as a  psychopath , but the helicopter was found on Venezuela's northern Caribbean coastline.  We ask for maximum support to find this fanatic, extremist terrorist,  vice president Tareck El Aissami said. The attack exacerbated an already full-blown political crisis in Venezuela after three months of opposition protests demanding general elections and fixes for the sinking economy. At least 76 people have died in the unrest since April, the latest a 25-year-old man shot in the head near a protest in the Petare slum of Caracas, authorities said on Wednesday.  Hundreds more people have been injured and arrested in what Maduro terms an ongoing coup attempt with U.S. encouragement. Related CoverageVenezuela movie actor behind helicopter attack on government buildingsMore Venezuelan children dying from preventable diseases amid crisisThe attack fed a conspiracy theory by opposition supporters that it may have been a government setup and overshadowed other drama on Tuesday, including the besieging of opposition legislators by gangs in the National Assembly. The helicopter raid also coincided with a judicial measure weakening the powers of dissident chief state prosecutor Luisa Ortega, who has emerged as a major challenger to Maduro.  It seems like a movie,  said Julio Borges, leader of the opposition-controlled legislature, of the helicopter raid.  Some people say it is a set-up, some that it is real ... Yesterday was full of contradictions ... A thousand things are happening, but I summarize it like this: a government is decaying and rotting, while a nation is fighting for dignity.   Though Perez posted a video on social media showing himself in front of four hooded armed men and claiming to represent a coalition of security and civilian officials rising up against  tyranny,  there was no evidence of deeper support.   Cheap Show  FILE PHOTO: Police official Oscar Perez poses for photographs during an event of the Body of Scientific, Penal and Criminal Investigation (CICPC) in Caracas, Venezuela March 1, 2015.Christian VeronThe government, however, accused the policemen of links to the CIA and to Miguel Rodriguez, a former interior minister and intelligence chief under Maduro and his predecessor Hugo Chavez, who recently broke with the government.  I'm not at all convinced by the helicopter incident,  Rodriguez told Reuters on Wednesday, saying the figures behind Perez in the video looked like dummies and expressing surprise the helicopter could fly freely and also not injure anyone.  Conclusion: a cheap show. Who gains from this? Only Nicolas for two reasons: to give credibility to his coup d'etat talk, and to blame Rodriguez,  he added, referring to himself. Around the time of the attack, the pro-government Supreme Court expanded the role of the state ombudsman, a human rights guarantor who is closely allied with Maduro, by giving him powers previously held only by the state prosecutor's office.     Opposition leaders described that as an attempt to supplant chief prosecutor Ortega, who has confronted both Maduro and the Supreme Court this year after splitting ranks. Slideshow (16 Images)The Supreme Court on Wednesday evening said it approved a measure blocking Ortega from leaving the country, freezing her bank accounts, and summoning her to a July 4 hearing to discuss whether she has committed  serious offenses.   Adding to Venezuela's tinder-box atmosphere, opposition supporters again took to the streets nationwide on Wednesday to barricade roads.  One opposition lawmaker, Juan Guaido, filmed himself bleeding from wounds he said were inflicted by rubber bullets.  Opposition supporters hope that cracks within government may swing the crisis their way, and have been delighted to see heavyweights like Ortega and Rodriguez oppose Maduro. Their main focus is to stop a July 30 vote called by Maduro to form a super-body known as a Constituent Assembly, with powers to rewrite the constitution and supersede other institutions. Maduro says the assembly is the only way to bring peace to Venezuela, but opponents say it is a sham vote intended solely to keep an unpopular government in power.   We can't let July 30 happen, we mustn't,  said children's health worker Rosa Toro, 52, blocking a road with friends.  We're being governed by criminals, traffickers and thieves,  added lawyer Matias Perez, 40, protesting with a plastic trumpet. Government officials lined up on Wednesday to condemn the helicopter attack, insisting it was the work of a few individuals and not representative of wider dissent.  Foreign Minister Samuel Moncada complained about the lack of international condemnation of the attack, saying it contrasted with the barrage of foreign criticism of the government.  In Europe it's now eight at night, but we've not had any reaction from European Union countries,  he said of a bloc that has been strongly critical of Maduro in recent months. The minister rejected accusations that the attack was carried out by the government for its own purposes.   Who can believe we are that sophisticated? Sending someone to throw grenades, who can believe that?  he asked.

{"news_time":"2017-06-29 21:06:00","news_title":"Exclusive: 'We're not taking sides' in creditor fights - Puerto Rico Governor","keywords":"Puerto Rico,United States,United States Virgin Islands,Ricardo Rossello,US,PUERTORICO,DEBT,ROSSELLO,EXCLUSIVE,United States","sector":"Markets","content":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Puerto Rico's governor said on Thursday his administration is  not choosing sides in a bitter dispute between two of the  bankrupt U.S. territory's largest creditors, despite some stakeholders' views to the contrary.   We are not taking sides  in litigation between holders of $18 billion in general obligation (GO) debt and nearly the same amount in sales tax-backed debt known as COFINA bonds, Governor Ricardo Rossello told Reuters.  I can safely say that.  In an exclusive interview, Rossello, a 38-year-old Massachusetts Institute of Technology alumnus elected governor in November, discussed creditor disputes, his relationship with Puerto Rico's federal oversight board, and the island's push for U.S. statehood.  The son of a former governor, Rossello is trying to lead the island out of a crisis marked by $72 billion in debt, a 45 percent poverty rate, insolvent public pensions and a shrinking population. GO and COFINA bondholders are battling for first claim on Puerto Rico's sales tax revenue, as part of the island's massive bankruptcy filed in federal court in May. Some COFINA creditors believe Rossello's government favors GO bondholders, after a GO group issued a joint statement with the administration in March saying they had begun restructuring talks. COFINA holders also point to the government's unsuccessful April restructuring offer that would have repaid GO holders nearly 20 cents on the dollar more than COFINA creditors. But Rossello said the restructuring offer was based on the market value of the bonds.  The skeptics read it wrong,  he said.  He also defended recent legislation allowing the government to redirect COFINA assets into the general fund. The law, he said, was necessary to comply with a fiscal turnaround plan approved in March by the island's oversight board, which requires the pooling of funds available to pay debt.  If we did not do that, the opposite argument would have been made ... that we've already decided [in favor of] COFINA,  he said. Rossello insisted his government wants clarity on which side is entitled to the funds, just as creditors do.  We've asked the courts to speed up and decide  that issue, he said. Private Investment, With Local Input Rossello is in an odd position - the head of state for an island whose economy is under the supervision of a federal board, created by the 2016 Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act, or PROMESA.  The board, appointed by U.S. lawmakers, is tasked with managing Puerto Rico's finances and helping it regain access to capital markets.  Ricardo Rossello, Governor of Puerto Rico, listens to a question during an interview in New York, U.S., June 29, 2017.Shannon Stapleton Is it a unique, bizarre situation?  he said.  Yes. I have to govern ... with policy decisions being made at the federal level that have an impact on Puerto Rico and seeing how I can meet it half-way.   Rossello said  the jury is still out  on whether the board has helped or hindered Puerto Rico. The governor has objected to statements by the board that the island could face furloughs if it cannot meet cost-savings benchmarks.   The board's job is to make sure we have balanced budgets and the potential to come into the markets again,  Rossello said.  They're not here to design policy. That's my job, that's the government's job.   One major policy initiative, set to begin this summer, is to seek bids on public-private partnerships, to incorporate private investment first on smaller projects like maritime transport, then bigger, energy and sewer infrastructure endeavors. Rossello said he wants to attract $5 billion of investment within the next three years, and to create as many as 100,000 jobs. Slideshow (3 Images)Too much outside investment could be risky: For decades, Puerto Rico's economy was based on tax breaks to lure outside firms. But when the tax breaks left, so did the jobs. Rossello said that, far from  selling off Puerto Rico,  his plan - at least on larger projects - is to have between 25 and 45 percent of the investment from local investors.  It was something the local community was asking for - being part of bigger projects, even if they can't own it,  Rossello said. A Push for Statehood Rossello began his political career as a wavy-haired grassroots organizer of the pro-statehood movement.  Now cleaner cut and living in the governor's mansion, Rossello has to balance the statehood debate with managing a dire financial crisis. Still, making Puerto Rico the 51st U.S. state is a top priority for Rossello. He reiterated calls for U.S. Congress to recognize the results of a June 11 plebiscite in which Puerto Ricans voted overwhelmingly in favor of U.S. statehood, even though voter turnout was only 23 percent. And with other U.S. territories facing similar economic squeezes, most notably the U.S. Virgin Islands, Rossello called the territorial system  inherently flawed.  Territories face a  lack of political participation and lack of democratic rights,  he said.   Puerto Rico's participation per capita in the armed forces is more than most states, yet they can't vote for their commander in chief,  he said.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/puertorico-debt-rossello-idUSL1N1JQ26H"},

Home Capital has been searching for a new CEO since March 27 when it terminated the employment of former chief executive Martin Reid.  Industry sources say attracting a candidate with strong relationships with mortgage and deposit brokers is critical.

Director Alan Hibben, a former Royal Bank of Canada (RY.TO) executive who has played a key role in negotiating the bank's refinancing and asset sales, said that he was not one of the candidates, despite media reports linking him with the role.

The technology sector .SPLRCT, which has led the S&P; 500's 8-percent gain for the year, dropped 1.8 percent, and were the worst-performing major group. Declines in big tech stocks, including Apple (AAPL.O) and Microsoft (MSFT.O), weighed the most on the benchmark S&P.; Financials .SPSY and energy .SPNY were the only sectors in positive territory as investors may have been rotating into groups that have lagged this year.  U.S. equities have remained extended, at or close to record territory for an extended period of time really without a tremendous amount of conviction in the market,  said Peter Kenny, senior market strategist at Global Markets Advisory Group, in New York.  It’s really been treading water. Without a major stimulus to drive prices higher, equities have to reset and that’s what they’re doing today,  Kenny said. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 167.58 points, or 0.78 percent, to 21,287.03, the S&P; 500 .SPX lost 20.99 points, or 0.86 percent, to 2,419.7 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 90.06 points, or 1.44 percent, to 6,144.35. The Nasdaq closed below its 50-day moving average for the first time since April 13, breaking below a key technical support level. The CBOE Volatility index .VIX, the widely followed barometer of expected near-term stock market volatility, rose to a six-week high of 15.16, before paring some of the move. Equity investors also may be concerned about the rise in interest rates globally, as a slew of hawkish comments from central banks signaled the beginning of the end of ultra-loose monetary policy. European stocks also declined. With the second quarter coming to a close, the market has experienced a volatile few days. Just on Wednesday, the tech-heavy Nasdaq had posted its best day since Nov. 7. Financials were the bright spot for the stock market, rising 0.7 percent. Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange shortly after the opening bell in New York, U.S., June 27, 2017.Lucas JacksonBank stocks gained after the U.S. Federal Reserve approved the banks' plans to raise dividend payouts and share buybacks under its annual stress test program. Wells Fargo (WFC.N) shares rose 2.7 percent while Citigroup (C.N) gained 2.8 percent. Energy inched 0.1 percent higher. Oil prices CLc1 edged up after a decline in weekly U.S. crude production temporarily eased concerns about oversupply.  There's a slight rotation,  said Omar Aguilar, chief investment officer for equities at Charles Schwab Investment Management.  You see the sectors that are underperforming are the ones that have done the best. Tech stocks are feeling the pain today, but it's more of a technical reversal.   Investors have been concerned about tepid U.S. economic growth as the Fed is raising interest rates from very low levels. Data showed the U.S. economy slowed less sharply in the first quarter than initially estimated due to unexpectedly higher consumer spending and a bigger jump in exports.  In corporate news, Rite Aid (RAD.N) shares slumped 26.5 percent after Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA.O) scrapped its deal to buy Rite Aid after failing to win antitrust approval, but said it would instead buy nearly half of the smaller rival's U.S. stores. Walgreens also ended a related deal to sell as many as 1,200 Rite Aid stores to Fred's Inc (FRED.O), sending Fred's shares down 22.8 percent. Walgreens shares rose 1.7 percent. Blue Apron Holdings (APRN.N) shares ended flat in their market debut following the meal-kit delivery company's watered down IPO in the shadow of Amazon.com's (AMZN.O) deal to buy Whole Foods Market WFM.N. Nike (NKE.N) shares rose after the market closed following the company's quarterly results. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 2.38-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.69-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The feud erupted on June 5 when Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt severed diplomatic and travel links with Qatar, accusing it also of courting regional foe Iran. Qatar denies the allegations.(For a graphic of Qatar's relations with its neighbors click tmsnrt.rs/2sinDGg) The four countries have sent Doha a list of 13 demands, including closing the state-funded Al Jazeera television station and reducing ties to Iran, an official of one of the four countries said. They gave Doha 10 days to comply. The deadline is expected to expire on Sunday. Kuwait, which retained ties with Qatar, is trying to mediate in the dispute with the support of the United States. In Washington on Thursday, Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani told reporters that Qatar, together with the Americans and Kuwaitis, was preparing responses. Related CoverageInternational businesses caught in Qatar crossfire We have to set the conditions first in order to pursue these negotiations,  Sheikh Mohammed said. At a later event, Sheikh Mohammed said the future of the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council could be at risk. The security group comprises Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait and Oman.  We believe this is a big question mark for the future of the GCC,  the foreign minister said in response to a question. FILE PHOTO: Buildings are seen on a coast line in Doha, Qatar June 5, 2017.Stringer/File PhotoThe group was formed to guard against external threats, he said, adding:  When the threat is coming from inside the GCC, there is a suspicion about the sustainability of the organization.  Sheikh Mohammed has called the demands by the four Arab countries  unreasonable  and said setting a deadline impinged on Qatar's sovereignty. Doha was ready to discuss  legitimate issues  with Arab states to end the crisis but some demands were impossible to meet because the underlying accusation was untrue, the foreign minister said in a statement earlier on Thursday.  We cannot 'sever links with so-called Islamic State, al-Qaeda and Lebanese Shia militant group Hezbollah' because no such links exist,  the statement said.  And we cannot 'expel any members of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard' because there are none in Qatar.  The director of Qatar's World Trade Organization office, Ali Alwaleed al-Thani, said Qatar was considering a complaint at the  WTO against a  blockade  by the Arab states.

Thursday's outcome was the largest on record for the period since 1964, maintaining a string of quarterly record highs dating back to March 2016. Still, analysts viewed the data as neutral for Chicago Mercantile Exchange lean hog futures on Friday because the results were close to expectations. Analysts attributed the herd expansion to improved producer profits, affordable feed and the need for more supplies to accommodate at least two new packing plants scheduled to come on line later this year. A record number of baby piglets that survived during the quarter helped farmers to be more efficient and boosted herd sizes. USDA's report showed the U.S. hog herd as of June 1 at 103.0 percent of the year-ago level or 71.650 million head. The result topped analysts' average forecasts and was the most for the quarter since USDA began compiling data for the period in 1964. Analysts, on average, had expected 71.597 million head, or 103.3 percent of the year-earlier herd. The U.S. breeding herd was 102.0 percent of the year-ago level, at 6.069 million head, up from 5.979 million last year. The average trade forecast was 6.069 million, or 101.5 percent of the previous year. The June 1 supply of market-ready hogs for sale to packers was 104.0 percent of a year earlier, at 65.581 million head, up from 63.302 million last year. Analysts, on average, had estimated a 3.5 percent rise, or 65.490 million. Allendale Inc chief strategist Rich Nelson called the record hog herd size  shocking,  but said it would have no effect on the market. Industry observers for several months had expected record production and most of the results came in line with expectations, he added. The industry will monitor whether two new hog plants will be operational by September to handle the massive supplies ahead, said Nelson.  Any delays in the start of the two plants will be clearly taken as bad news by the industry,  he added. Bob Brown, an independent market analyst in Edmond, Oklahoma, agreed that the  numbers came in pretty much as expected - nothing outlandish.  Nearby CME hog futures will likely follow prices for market-ready, or cash, hogs and not focus on trading months further out associated with Thursday's report, said Brown.

Assistant U.S. Attorney Edward Imperatore told the jurors that in July 2014, Block plugged fake numbers into a spreadsheet that was used to prepare American Realty's financial report for the second quarter of that year, misleading investors.  You can't lie to investors,  Imperatore said.  It's pretty much that simple.  Block's lawyer, Reid Weingarten, later told jurors in his closing argument that Block was dealing with a difficult accounting problem that quarter because the company had just changed its accounting methods.  He faced interesting choices, all of which would have been legitimate,  Weingarten said.  But fraud was not included in the mix.  American Realty shares plunged as much as 37 percent on Oct. 29, 2014, wiping out roughly $4 billion of market value, after the company said employees intentionally concealed accounting errors. It also said Block and its chief accounting officer, Lisa McAlister, had resigned the previous day. Block was charged last year with securities fraud. Authorities said he falsified numbers in July 2014 to disguise a calculation error in a previous report. Imperatore in Thursday reviewed testimony from two government witnesses: McAlister and Ryan Steel, American Realty's former director of financial reporting. McAlister has pleaded guilty and is cooperating with prosecutors, while Steel is cooperating under a non-prosecution agreement. Imperatore recounted how both witnesses testified they saw Block change numbers in the spreadsheet and were uncomfortable. Steel said he was  freaking out  and could not sleep that night, according to Imperatore. Weingarten, on the other hand, said the changes were made  with the full knowledge of everyone involved.  He said the company switched accounting methods for legitimate business reasons, and there was no accounting error to disguise. He also attacked the witnesses' credibility, calling McAlister a  trained puppy dog  for the prosecutors.

The CNPC, a national council of cattle ranchers, asked the government, which oversees the vaccination program, to halve the doses, change the place where vaccines are administered on the animals from muscle to just beneath the skin, and to eliminate a substance called saponin from the vaccines. Brazil, home to the world's largest cattle herd, has for decades required ranchers to administer FMD vaccines twice a year to the animals, aiming to eradicate an illness that has in the past prevented its beef from entering valued export markets. The market for FMD vaccines is estimated by CNPC to be worth 500 million reais ($151 million) per year.  The largest producers are locally listed firm Ouro Fino Saúde Animal Participações SA, Boehringer Ingelheim do Brasil Química e Farmacêutica, a subsidiary of German firm Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH, and Ceva Saúde Animal Ltda, the local unit of France's Ceva Santé Animale SA [NEINVA.UL]. The United States suspended imports of Brazilian fresh beef last week, saying a high percentage of shipments failed to pass safety checks. One of the main problems were abscesses, which Brazilian ranchers blame on the vaccines. CNPC also said Brazil should scrap the vaccination in 12 states that are home to around 120 million heads which have not reported a FMD case in more than 20 years.  We can't continue the program as it is,  CNPC head Sebastião Guedes told Reuters on Thursday.  He hopes the U.S. ban would lead the government to listen to the suggestions for changes regarding vaccination.  Brazil's agriculture ministry opened an investigation into the problems, aiming to also check possible adverse reactions to the vaccines.  The producers declined to comment individually, saying the industry association Sindan would should answer questions on their behalf. Sindan on Thursday defended the country-wide vaccination, saying ending it in some states could put the whole herd under risk due to lack of vaccination in some of Brazil's neighbors such as Venezuela. It again denied infections or abscesses were a possible reaction to the vaccine, saying they would be likely linked to inappropriate handling of the process, such using dirty or damaged needles.

The jury in a Manhattan federal court said the Alavi Foundation, majority owner of an office tower at 650 Fifth Avenue, knew that its partner and the building's minority owner, Assa Corp, was a front for Iran, and helped conceal the fact. Jurors said the government had proven that the property was involved in or traceable to money laundering. The government wanted to seize the 36-story building, which could be worth nearly $1 billion, to benefit people with legal judgments against Iran relating to bombings and other attacks.  In this trial, 650 Fifth Avenue’s secret was laid bare for all to see,  said Acting U.S. Attorney Joon Kim in Manhattan, whose office represented the government.  On behalf of all of our clients, we are extremely pleased with the decision and the verdict handed down today,  said James Bernard, a lawyer for the judgment holders.  The Alavi Foundation is disappointed by today’s verdict and by the court’s decision in the related cases and is considering its options,  said John Gleeson, a former federal judge who represented the foundation at trial. Alavi was founded in 1973 as the Pahlavi Foundation by the then-Shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. It describes its mission as promoting the study of Persian and Islamic culture in the United States, and also funds schools and free clinics. The tower at 650 Fifth Avenue was built at the shah's behest in 1978 to provide a source of income. After the Islamic Revolution in 1979 that ousted the shah, Iran's new government replaced much of Alavi's board of directors. In 1989, Alavi entered into a partnership with Iran's state-controlled Bank Melli under which Alavi owned a majority share of the building, and the bank owned the rest through a subsidiary, Assa. The case turned on whether Alavi knew that Assa was still owned by Bank Melli after the United States imposed sanctions on Iran in 1995. Lawyers for the government argued that it did, but kept distributing rental income to Assa anyway, while working to conceal its ownership from U.S. authorities. Gleeson argued that the foundation was led to believe that Bank Melli was sold before the sanctions took effect.

When he exited the game, Fulmer was apologetic. Detroit Tigers fans showered manager Brad Ausmus with boos when he removed Fulmer but the second-year right-hander had no complaints.  I said, 'Sorry, Skip,'  Fulmer said.  I don't want to have him use anybody from the bullpen. He kind of looked at me and said, 'Don't apologize for anything. You had a great game.' I don't blame him for the move there.  Justin Wilson recorded the last out and Fulmer settled for a victory. The Detroit offense backed him with three homers as the Tigers thumped the Kansas City Royals 7-3 on Thursday afternoon at Comerica Park. Fulmer (7-6) gave up seven hits and struck out seven. He erased three of the baserunners on double plays. Related CoveragePreview: Royals at TigersKansas City Royals - PlayerWatchDetroit Tigers - PlayerWatchHe just missed recording the second shutout of his career. He blanked Texas last August 14 during his rookie season.  I wanted him to complete the game, too,  Ausmus said.  First, he loses the shutout. OK, no big deal. Obviously, he can still get the complete game. But at some point I felt like I had to make a decision because the most important thing is winning. Could Michael have gotten the next out? Maybe. Probably, actually. But I felt like the tide had turned a little bit. I just wanted to stop the momentum in its tracks.  Justin Upton hit a three-run homer in the first inning. Andrew Romine supplied a two-run shot, and Ian Kinsler added a solo homer for the Tigers (35-43), who have won three of their last four games. Kinsler reached base three times and scored three times. Drew Butera's two-run double in the ninth broke up Fulmer's shutout bid. Kansas City's other run scored on an Upton error.  Just one out short,  Fulmer said.  I felt like the stuff was good all game. Even that ninth inning, I got two quick outs. I wasn't trying to overdo anything. I felt like they fouled off some great pitches and ultimately they just found holes that one inning.  Jake Junis (2-2) gave up six runs on seven hits in six innings as the Royals (38-39) lost their first series since Detroit took two of three from them in Kansas City last month.  It was a tale of good and bad,  Royals manager Ned Yost said of his rookie right-hander.  He didn't have his good stuff at all. A lot of mislocated sliders, mislocated fastballs. But with the weekend coming up and a split doubleheader on Saturday, we really need some length out of him today. Going six innings was a tremendous job for us.  Upton gave his club a quick jolt. He followed a single by Kinsler and walk to Alex Avila by smoking a 2-0 pitch into the left-center field stands. That gave him a team-high 15 homers on the season. Kinsler led off the third with his ninth homer. Romine made it 6-0 when he followed a one-out single by Mikie Mahtook with a blast into the right field stands. Fulmer was struck in the right leg by Alex Gordon's line-drive single in the sixth but shook it off and struck out the next batter, Ramon Torres.  We were hoping to wear him down earlier than the ninth inning with two outs,  Yost said.  He just had an electric fastball and really good slider. We didn't even really have any scoring opportunities up until the ninth inning.  J.D. Martinez completed a 15-pitch at-bat in the seventh with a run-scoring single off Kevin McCarthy. Martinez, who fouled a ball off his foot earlier in the at-bat, was then removed for a pinch-runner. NOTES: Detroit LHP Matt Boyd will be recalled from Triple-A Toledo to start one of the two games in Saturday's doubleheader against Cleveland. Boyd, who made 11 starts with the Tigers earlier this season, is 3-0 with a 2.86 ERA in five starts with the Mud Hens. ... Royals OF/DH Jorge Soler, who was recalled from Triple-A Omaha on Wednesday, will receive regular playing time.  He's coming off a good stint down there and looked good (Wednesday) night,  manager Ned Yost said.  Just want to try to get him some consistent at-bats up here and hopefully get him in a good groove.  ... Kansas City LHP Jason Vargas will try to stretch his personal winning streak to seven consecutive starts against Minnesota on Friday. It's the longest streak of consecutive winning starts by a Royals pitcher since Zack Greinke in 2008-09. ... The Tigers are 1-20 in games in which they didn't hit a homer.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-royals-tigers-writethru-idUSMTZED6TBRPL7X"},

The studies, one conducted across three European countries and another in Canada, found some negative effects after exposure to neonicotinoids in wild and honeybee populations, but also some positives, depending on the environmental context. Scientists who conducted the European research - in Britain, Hungary and Germany - told reporters their overall findings suggested neonicotinoids are harmful to honeybee and wild bee populations and are  a cause for concern . But scientists representing companies who funded the work - Germany's Bayer AG and Switerland's Syngenta AG - said the results showed  no consistent effect . Several independent experts said the findings were mixed or inconclusive. The European Union has since 2014 had a moratorium on use of neonicotinoids - made and sold by various companies including Bayer and Syngenta - after lab research pointed to potential risks for bees, crucial for pollinating crops. But crop chemical companies say real-world evidence is not there to blame a global plunge in bee numbers in recent years on neonicotinoid pesticides alone. They argue it is a complex phenomenon due to multiple factors. A spokesman for the EU's food safety watchdog EFSA, said the agency is in the process of assessing all studies and data for a full re-evaluation of neonicotinoids, expected in November. EFSA's scientific assessment will be crucial to a European Commission decision in consultation with EU states on whether the moratorium on neonicotinoid use should remain in place. The two studies published on Thursday, in the peer-reviewed journal Science, are important because they were field studies that sought to examine the real-world exposure of bees to pesticides in nature. Researchers who led the Canadian study concluded that worker bees exposed to neonicotinoids - which they said often came from contaminated pollen from nearby plants, not from treated crops - had lower life expectancies and their colonies were more likely to suffer from a loss of queen bees. On the findings of the European study, researchers told a briefing in London that exposure to neonicotinoid crops harmed honeybee colonies in two of the three countries and reduced the reproductive success of wild bees across all three. They noted, however, that results from Germany showed a positive effect on bees exposed to neonicotinoids, although they said this was temporary and the reasons behind it were unclear.  This represents the complexity of the real world,  said Richard Pywell, a professor at Britain's Centre of Ecology and Hydrology who co-led the work.  In certain circumstances, you may have a positive effect ... and in other circumstances you may have a negative effect  Overall, however, he said:  We are showing significant negative effects on (bees') critical life-cycle stages, which is a cause for concern.  Several specialists with no direct involvement in the study who were asked to assess its findings said they were mixed. Rob Smith, a professor at Britain's University of Huddersfield, said the results were  important in showing that there are detectable effects of neonicotinoid treatments on honeybees in the real world , but added:  These effects are not consistent . Lynn Dicks at the University of East Anglia said the findings  illustrate the complexity of environmental science .  If there was a really big effect of neonicotinoids on bees, in whatever circumstances they were used, it would have shown up in both of these studies,  she said. Norman Carreck, an insect expert at Britain's Sussex University, said:  Whilst adding to our knowledge, the study throws up more questions than it answers.

Long-term pricing looks sensible and offers decent protection though investors will need to search to find attractive income streams and sources of growth that can deliver target returns, said the investment management arm of Prudential Financial Inc. Following the financial crisis of a decade ago, investors benefited from historically low interest rates, low valuations and rising rents, resulting in returns not seen since the 1980s. There is no evidence of mispricing in major markets, leverage has been reduced and prime real estate is priced at about fair value, said Peter Hayes, PGIM Real Estate's global head of investment research.   There is no obvious trigger out there that would point to a collapse in real estate values,  he said.  There's definite investor nervousness (but) that's always been the case. But there's no evidence of systemic risk,  he said. PGIM, which manages $65.9 billion in real estate assets, said opportunities can be found in non-gateway U.S. markets such as Dallas and Phoenix and non-central business districts in Asia and Europe, where office rental demand looks strong. Ongoing demand for warehousing in the United States and elsewhere because of e-commerce and the world's growing middle class, which is driving tourism, especially in Asia, also offer opportunities, PGIM said in a presentation. Caution, which has reigned since the global financial crisis, still prevails as investors take their foot off the pedal a little bit after the superior returns from 2010-2015, Hayes said.  In core U.S. real estate assets those returns were in the mid-teens and now will likely be in the high single digits, said Eric Adler, chief executive of PGIM Real Estate. The number of global transactions fell in 2016 but were still high from a historical perspective, suggesting continued competition for deals, PGIM said. However, the amount of capital targeting real estate has dropped slightly and pricing pressure in global markets has cooled, it said. Eight global gateway cities - London, Paris, Hong Kong, Tokyo, New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Washington - account for about one-third of investment capital, Hayes said.

The jury in a Manhattan federal court said the Alavi Foundation, majority owner of an office tower at 650 Fifth Avenue, knew that its partner and the building's minority owner, Assa Corp, was a front for Iran, and helped conceal the fact. Jurors said the government had proven that the property was involved in or traceable to money laundering. The government wanted to seize the 36-story building, which could be worth nearly $1 billion, to benefit people with legal judgments against Iran relating to bombings and other attacks.  In this trial, 650 Fifth Avenue’s secret was laid bare for all to see,  said Acting U.S. Attorney Joon Kim in Manhattan, whose office represented the government.  On behalf of all of our clients, we are extremely pleased with the decision and the verdict handed down today,  said James Bernard, a lawyer for the judgment holders.  The Alavi Foundation is disappointed by today’s verdict and by the court’s decision in the related cases and is considering its options,  said John Gleeson, a former federal judge who represented the foundation at trial. Alavi was founded in 1973 as the Pahlavi Foundation by the then-Shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. It describes its mission as promoting the study of Persian and Islamic culture in the United States, and also funds schools and free clinics. The tower at 650 Fifth Avenue was built at the shah's behest in 1978 to provide a source of income. After the Islamic Revolution in 1979 that ousted the shah, Iran's new government replaced much of Alavi's board of directors. In 1989, Alavi entered into a partnership with Iran's state-controlled Bank Melli under which Alavi owned a majority share of the building, and the bank owned the rest through a subsidiary, Assa. The case turned on whether Alavi knew that Assa was still owned by Bank Melli after the United States imposed sanctions on Iran in 1995. Lawyers for the government argued that it did, but kept distributing rental income to Assa anyway, while working to conceal its ownership from U.S. authorities. Gleeson argued that the foundation was led to believe that Bank Melli was sold before the sanctions took effect.

Assistant U.S. Attorney Edward Imperatore told the jurors that in July 2014, Block plugged fake numbers into a spreadsheet that was used to prepare American Realty's financial report for the second quarter of that year, misleading investors.  You can't lie to investors,  Imperatore said.  It's pretty much that simple.  Block's lawyer, Reid Weingarten, later told jurors in his closing argument that Block was dealing with a difficult accounting problem that quarter because the company had just changed its accounting methods.  He faced interesting choices, all of which would have been legitimate,  Weingarten said.  But fraud was not included in the mix.  American Realty shares plunged as much as 37 percent on Oct. 29, 2014, wiping out roughly $4 billion of market value, after the company said employees intentionally concealed accounting errors. It also said Block and its chief accounting officer, Lisa McAlister, had resigned the previous day. Block was charged last year with securities fraud. Authorities said he falsified numbers in July 2014 to disguise a calculation error in a previous report. Imperatore in Thursday reviewed testimony from two government witnesses: McAlister and Ryan Steel, American Realty's former director of financial reporting. McAlister has pleaded guilty and is cooperating with prosecutors, while Steel is cooperating under a non-prosecution agreement. Imperatore recounted how both witnesses testified they saw Block change numbers in the spreadsheet and were uncomfortable. Steel said he was  freaking out  and could not sleep that night, according to Imperatore. Weingarten, on the other hand, said the changes were made  with the full knowledge of everyone involved.  He said the company switched accounting methods for legitimate business reasons, and there was no accounting error to disguise. He also attacked the witnesses' credibility, calling McAlister a  trained puppy dog  for the prosecutors. Ryan, he said, was a  black and white guy, quick to make a judgment,  who even described himself as an  alarmist.

The CNPC, a national council of cattle ranchers, asked the government, which oversees the vaccination program, to halve the doses, change the place where vaccines are administered on the animals from muscle to just beneath the skin, and to eliminate a substance called saponin from the vaccines. Brazil, home to the world's largest cattle herd, has for decades required ranchers to administer FMD vaccines twice a year to the animals, aiming to eradicate an illness that has in the past prevented its beef from entering valued export markets. The market for FMD vaccines is estimated by CNPC to be worth 500 million reais ($151 million) per year.  The largest producers are locally listed firm Ouro Fino Saúde Animal Participações SA, Boehringer Ingelheim do Brasil Química e Farmacêutica, a subsidiary of German firm Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH, and Ceva Saúde Animal Ltda, the local unit of France's Ceva Santé Animale SA [NEINVA.UL]. The United States suspended imports of Brazilian fresh beef last week, saying a high percentage of shipments failed to pass safety checks. One of the main problems were abscesses, which Brazilian ranchers blame on the vaccines. CNPC also said Brazil should scrap the vaccination in 12 states that are home to around 120 million heads which have not reported a FMD case in more than 20 years.  We can't continue the program as it is,  CNPC head Sebastião Guedes told Reuters on Thursday.  He hopes the U.S. ban would lead the government to listen to the suggestions for changes regarding vaccination.  Brazil's agriculture ministry opened an investigation into the problems, aiming to also check possible adverse reactions to the vaccines.  The producers declined to comment individually, saying the industry association Sindan would should answer questions on their behalf. Sindan on Thursday defended the country-wide vaccination, saying ending it in some states could put the whole herd under risk due to lack of vaccination in some of Brazil's neighbors such as Venezuela. It again denied infections or abscesses were a possible reaction to the vaccine, saying they would be likely linked to inappropriate handling of the process, such using dirty or damaged needles.

With Kerber losing, Simona Halep could have taken over the German's top spot in the world rankings if she had gone on to reach the final of this event but the Romanian missed out by losing to Caroline Wozniacki in three sets. Konta, Britain's big hope in the women's draw at Wimbledon starting next week, proved the main attraction as she beat two grand slam winners in the space of a few hours. Two days of rain delays at the south coast grass court event had left a punishing two-match schedule for most of the players but Konta rose brilliantly to the challenge, first overcoming Ostapenko 7-5 3-6 6-4 before later eclipsing Kerber 6-3 6-4. Konta's victory over top seed Kerber, though, was accompanied by high drama when, while holding match point, she slipped and fell heavily on to her back while also hitting her head on the ground. Lying on the turf and initially sobbing from the shock and the pain, the British number one needed treatment as the match was halted for 10 minutes amid fears she might not be fit to continue. Kerber was so concerned that she came around the net to help her distraught opponent yet, remarkably, the groggy Konta rejoined the fray and won the next two points to set up a semi-final on Friday against Czech third seed Karolina Pliskova, who beat Svetlana Kuznetsova 6-7(7) 6-2 6-4 in their quarter-final.

Slideshow (5 Images) It's been a busy afternoon, we've played a lot of tennis and I'm looking forward to recovering the best I can.  Konta, set to become the first British woman ranked in the world's top 10 at Wimbledon since 1984, had earlier rallied from a break down in the deciding set to end newly-crowned French Open champion Ostapenko's eight-match winning streak. Fifth seed Konta then won the final four games and saved a break point in the tense last one, in which the 20-year-old Latvian also saved two match points, before clinching victory in two hours 18 minutes. Wozniacki fought back from a set down against Halep to win 5-7 6-4 6-1 and reach the last four, where the Dane will meet another Briton Heather Watson, who beat Czech Barbora Strycova 6-1 1-6 6-4 in the other quarter-final. Sixth-seeded Wozniacki said:  She (Halep) came out with some amazing shots and I lost the first set, and she had the momentum in the second. But I kept grinding and kept digging in there and somehow managed to turn it around .

The election of Trump and his early days in office sent U.S.-Mexico relations to a new low due to his threats to slap tariffs on Mexican-made goods and a plan to build a wall on the southern U.S. border to keep out illegal immigrants. The foreign ministry said the two leaders would review progress in various aspects of the bilateral relationship, and that more details would be published in due course. In late January, a planned meeting between the presidents was canceled following a Twitter dispute over Trump's pledge to make Mexico pay for the wall. The American president has since shied away from that demand. Trump's administration also moved toward talks to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), toning down earlier threats to pull out of the pact with Mexico and Canada. This month, the U.S. and Mexican governments resolved a long-standing dispute over the sugar trade, while agricultural ministers from the three NAFTA countries met and said there were  relatively few  differences over farm trade to resolve in talks.

The report was circulated to members of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) in The Hague, but was not made public. The attack on April 4 in the town of Khan Sheikhoun in northern Idlib province was the most deadly in Syria's civil war in more than three years. It prompted a U.S. missile strike against a Syrian air base which Washington said was used to launch the strike. After interviewing witnesses and examining samples, a fact- finding mission (FFM) of the OPCW concluded that  a large number of people, some of whom died, were exposed to sarin or a sarin-like substance. Related CoverageFrance says watchdog's report on Syria proves sarin gas used in April'No doubt' Assad government behind sarin attack in Syria: UK's JohnsonRussia says chemical watchdog's report on Syria attack is biased: agencies It is the conclusion of the FFM that such a release can only be determined as the use of sarin, as a chemical weapon,  a summary of the report said.  Now that we know the undeniable truth, we look forward to an independent investigation to confirm exactly who was responsible for these brutal attacks so we can find justice for the victims,  U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said in a statement on Thursday.  FILE PHOTO: A man breathes through an oxygen mask as another one receives treatments, after what rescue workers described as a suspected gas attack in the town of Khan Sheikhoun in rebel-held Idlib, Syria April 4, 2017.Ammar AbdullahA joint United Nations and OPCW investigation, known as the JIM, can now look at the incident to determine who is to blame, she said. The JIM has found Syrian government forces were responsible for three chlorine gas attacks in 2014 and 2015 and that Islamic State militants used mustard gas. Western intelligence agencies had also blamed the government of Bashar al-Assad for the April chemical attack. Syrian officials have repeatedly denied using banned toxins in the conflict. The mission was unable to visit the site itself due to security concerns and will not attempt to get there, the head of the OPCW was said to have decided. Syria joined the chemicals weapons convention in 2013 under a Russian-U.S. agreement, averting military intervention under then U.S. President Barack Obama.  The United States said on Wednesday the Syrian government appeared to have heeded a warning this week from Washington not to carry out a chemical weapons attack. Russia, the Syrian government's main backer in the civil war, warned it would respond proportionately if the United States took pre-emptive measures against Syrian forces after Washington said on Monday it appeared the Syrian military was preparing to conduct a chemical weapons attack.

The Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P;/TSX composite index ended down 142.16 points, or 0.93 percent, at 15,213.42. All 10 of its main sectors ended in the red. The utilities and telecom sectors, where stocks typically pay chunky dividends and are sensitive to changing expectations for interest rates, both fell at least 1 percent. Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz earlier this week said that rate cuts in 2015 had done their job, part of a dramatic shift to a more hawkish tone from the central bank that startled analysts who had not expected a hike until 2018. The market is now fully pricing in a hike by October.  It's a combination of a shift in stance from the Bank of Canada which is maybe accelerating fund flows heading into quarter-end,  said Bryden Teich, portfolio manager at Avenue Investment Management.  There's no fundamental reason why something that was up yesterday should be down today.  The index is expected to edge up to set a new high by the middle of 2018, a Reuters poll found on Thursday, boosted by moderate economic growth offsetting depressed oil prices and worries about the country's housing market. Industrials fell 1.2 percent, with Canadian National Railway Co down 2 percent at C$105.45 and Bombardier Inc off 1.2 percent at C$2.42 after the company confirmed its transportation unit plans to cut up to 2,200 jobs in Germany as part of a sweeping savings plan. Alimentation Couche Tard Inc declined 2.5 percent to C$62.75. The convenience store operator's shares had jumped earlier in the week on news it had won U.S. antitrust approval to buy rival CST Brands Inc. Heavyweight energy and gold mining stocks also weighed, with pipeline operator Enbridge Inc down 1.3 percent and gold miner Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd off 3.8 percent at C$58.24.

Vista Oil & Gas, the special purpose vehicle, intends to purchase energy exploration and production assets in Mexico, Colombia, Argentina and Brazil within two years of its listing, tentatively planned for a month from now, according to an investor presentation. The stock market listing would be the first to take advantage of a 2013 constitutional change that opened Mexico's energy production and exploration to private investors for the first time in 75 years. Reuters could not immediately reach a Riverstone spokesman. Special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, raise money from investors and then go shopping, betting that their management teams will find attractive deals at suitable prices.  They have gained ground in U.S. shale oil and gas because they hold cash that can be invested quickly, and because their publicly traded shares are more liquid than private equity investments. Riverstone, a private equity group founded in 2000, has committed over $35 billion in 130 investments in the energy industry.  Galuccio resigned as head of YPF last year amid a change in administration by Argentina's incoming president, Mauricio Macri. Credit Suisse and Citi are managing the listing of Vista Oil & Gas, according to its prospectus.

The dollar index touched its lowest since October, before Donald Trump was elected U.S. president, as investors shifted to the view that Federal Reserve might not be the only game in town when it comes to higher interest rates. With the Fed approving dividends and buybacks in major banks as part of another round of stress tests, U.S. financial stocks rose but not enough to offset declines in technology and interest rate-sensitive sectors.  Part of the reason why tech is down today is the steam in the recent rotation out of some of big tech winners and into banks,  said Michael Scanlon, portfolio manager at Manulife Asset Management in Boston.

Bank of England Governor Mark Carney surprised many on Wednesday by conceding a rate hike was likely to be needed as the economy came closer to running at full capacity. That sent sterling above $1.30 on Thursday for the first time in five weeks, leaving it close to its highest levels since last September. The pound was last trading at $1.3006, up 0.63 percent on the day. The Bank of Canada also had its say, with two top policymakers this week suggesting they might tighten monetary policy there as early as July. The Canadian dollar strengthened 0.30 percent versus the greenback at 1.30 per dollar.  The shifting monetary policy trajectories of other central banks is making other currencies more attractive relative to the U.S. dollar,  said Kathy Lien, managing director at BK Asset Management in New York. The Japanese yen strengthened 0.16 percent versus the greenback at 112.12 per dollar. Benchmark U.S. Treasury yields rose to five-week peaks in sympathy with higher European government debt yields, as investors evaluated the likelihood of less accommodative policy.  What's going on in Europe is really what's driving us here,  said Brian Daingerfield, a macro strategist at NatWest Markets in Stamford, Connecticut. Treasury 10-year notes last fell 13/32 in price to yield 2.2666 percent, from 2.223 percent late on Wednesday. U.S. oil futures were slightly higher after hitting a two-week peak, extending a rally into a sixth straight session after a decline in weekly U.S. crude production temporarily alleviated concerns about deepening oversupply.

The pound was last trading at $1.3006, up 0.63 percent on the day. The Bank of Canada also had its say, with two top policymakers this week suggesting they might tighten monetary policy there as early as July. The Canadian dollar strengthened 0.30 percent versus the greenback at 1.30 per dollar.  The shifting monetary policy trajectories of other central banks is making other currencies more attractive relative to the U.S. dollar,  said Kathy Lien, managing director at BK Asset Management in New York. The Japanese yen strengthened 0.16 percent versus the greenback at 112.12 per dollar. Benchmark U.S. Treasury yields rose to five-week peaks in sympathy with higher European government debt yields, as investors evaluated the likelihood of less accommodative policy.  What's going on in Europe is really what's driving us here,  said Brian Daingerfield, a macro strategist at NatWest Markets in Stamford, Connecticut. Treasury 10-year notes last fell 13/32 in price to yield 2.2666 percent, from 2.223 percent late on Wednesday. U.S. oil futures were slightly higher after hitting a two-week peak, extending a rally into a sixth straight session after a decline in weekly U.S. crude production temporarily alleviated concerns about deepening oversupply. Brent ticked lower. U.S. crude rose 0.29 percent to $44.87 per barrel and Brent was last at $47.36, up 0.11 percent on the day. Gold fell as the central bank comments lifted bond yields. Spot gold dropped 0.3 percent to $1,245.31 an ounce. U.S. gold futures fell 0.26 percent to $1,245.80 an ounce. Copper rose 0.75 percent to $5,925.00 a tonne.

Vista Oil & Gas, the special purpose vehicle, intends to purchase energy exploration and production assets in Mexico, Colombia, Argentina and Brazil within two years of its listing, tentatively planned for a month from now, according to an investor presentation. The stock market listing would be the first to take advantage of a 2013 constitutional change that opened Mexico's energy production and exploration to private investors for the first time in 75 years.

Special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, raise money from investors and then go shopping, betting that their management teams will find attractive deals at suitable prices.  They have gained ground in U.S. shale oil and gas because they hold cash that can be invested quickly, and because their publicly traded shares are more liquid than private equity investments.

Monthly temperatures for June are set to be about 3 degrees Celsius (4.8 Fahrenheit) above long-term averages for Western Europe, the World Weather Attribution group of scientists said in a report.  We found clear and strong links between this month's record warmth and human-caused climate change,  said Geert Jan van Oldenborgh, senior researcher at the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute, one of the authors. Climate change, stoked by man-made use of fossil fuels, had made the intensity and frequency of such heat at least four times more likely in France, Switzerland, the Netherlands and central England and made it 10 times as likely in Portugal and Spain, the study found, based on historical trends. The scientists said the heat was vanishingly unlikely to be a freak natural event, and could not be explained by shifts in the sun's output or by other natural factors such as low amounts of sun-dimming volcanic dust in the atmosphere. That meant that a build-up of man-made greenhouse gas emissions, mainly from burning fossil fuels, had raised the risks.  By the end of the century, these high temperatures will become the norm in Western Europe,  they added.  Heat can be deadly — especially for the very young and the elderly,  said Friederike Otto of Oxford University who was one of the authors.  It is critical that cities work with scientists and public health experts to develop heat action plans.  Forest fires in Portugal killed more than 60 people and more than 2,000 people were evacuated in Spain to escape wildfires.  Heat wave plans were triggered in France, Switzerland and the Netherlands in June. Much of France had the hottest June night on record on June 21 and England had its hottest June day since a summer heatwave in 1976.

The guilty plea, by former Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams, 50, ended a two-week trial. He was indicted in March on 23 charges including bribery and fraud. Williams compromised himself and his elected office by using his office to help  those willing to secretly pay him with valuable items like money, trips, and cars,  as well as by defrauding his political action committee and others, Acting U.S. Attorney William Fitzpatrick said in a statement. Williams, who maintained his innocence until Thursday's hearing, will remain in custody until his sentencing on Oct. 24.  He faces a maximum of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine, federal prosecutors said in the statement. Between July 2010 and May 2015, prosecutors said, Williams accepted trips, money and other items of value from a Philadelphia-area businessman, Mohammad N. Ali. In return, the prosecutors said, Williams took steps including  contacting a Philadelphia police official in order to pressure and advise the official to assist Ali with security screenings at the airport.  Williams' attorney, Michael Diamondstein, did not immediately return a call requesting comment on Thursday. Ali, 40, pleaded guilty in May to federal bribery and tax evasion charges. Williams was also accused of soliciting bribes from two business owners that included a sofa, cash, clothing and a trip to Punta Cana, Dominican Republic. The former district attorney, who according to local media reports was led out of the courtroom in handcuffs, agreed in January to pay $62,000 in civil penalties to end a Philadelphia ethics board investigation into his failure to disclose gifts that also included NBA basketball tickets.

Buyout firms largely have refrained from attempting leveraged buyouts of U.S. retailers in the past two years, amid a wave of bankruptcies in the sector that have included Sports Authority, Rue21, Gymboree and BCBG Max Azria LLC. Sycamore's deal for Staples, however, which Reuters was first to report would come this week, illustrates that some buyout firms are distinguishing between mall-based fashion retailers, which are vulnerable to changing consumer tastes, from retailers with a niche and rich cash flow, such as Staples.  The acquisition also shows that Sycamore, whose buyout fund is dedicated to retail deals, is willing to take on the risk of falling store sales at Staples because of the potential it sees in Staples' delivery unit, which supplies businesses directly.  Sycamore said it would pay $10.25 per share in cash for Staples. The shares ended trading at $9.93 on Wednesday after Reuters reported the exact deal price. Staples said the deal was expected to close by December. Shira Goodman will remain as Staples CEO.

This structure will give Sycamore the option to shed Staples' retail business in the future, one of the sources said. Framingham, Massachusetts-based Staples, which made its name selling paper, pens and other supplies, has 1,255 stores in the United States and 304 in Canada. It previously tried to merge with rival retailer Office Depot Inc (ODP.O) but the deal was thwarted by a U.S. federal judge on antitrust grounds last year. A shopping cart is seen outside a Staples office supplies store in the Chicago suburb of Glenview, Illinois, February 4, 2015. No. 1 office supply chain Staples and smaller rival Office Depot Inc said on May 10, 2016, they would terminate their planned merger after a U.S. federal judge ordered the deal temporarily halted because of antitrust concerns.Jim Young/File PhotoStaples has the largest share of office supply stores in the United States at 48 percent, according to Euromonitor, and generated $889 million of adjusted free cash flow in 2016. Sycamore has a reputation amongst private equity peers for taking bets on retail investments others might eschew. Its previous investments include regional department store operator Belk Inc, discount general merchandise retailer Dollar Express and mall and web-based specialty retailer Hot Topic.

Rite Aid's shares plunged about 28 percent to $2.85, while Walgreens shares were up 1 percent at $77.97. Walgreens also ended a related deal to sell as many as 1,200 Rite Aid stores to Fred's Inc (FRED.O), sending Fred's shares down 19 percent. Walgreens, the biggest U.S. drugstore chain, will likely have an easier time winning antitrust approval to buy 2,186 Rite Aid stores after it failed to win approval to take over the nearly 4,600-store chain.  Walgreens and Rite Aid have taken a pragmatic approach,  said Neil Saunders, managing director of market research firm GlobalData Retail. The revised deal could offer many of the same benefits as a whole-sale take out of the company, but on a smaller scale. Walgreens said it expects about $400 million of cost savings from its new agreement, down from around $1 billion expected from the original deal.  That could help offset challenges it faced in recent years hitting targets for sales growth, which has been weighed on in part by disappointing growth in its retail segment.  Walgreens also invited Rite Aid to join its group purchasing agreement, which aims to leverage the combined heft of its members to negotiate discounts on generic drug prices.  The decision to sell so many stores will weaken Rite Aid and could still be controversial, said David Balto, an antitrust lawyer who had worked with groups opposing Walgreens’ takeover of Rite Aid.  Rite Aid's future is going to be bleak after they sell these stores. This is still going to raise some serious questions. It's still taking out a major competitor,  Balto said. In fact, Walgreens' plan to buy 2,186 Rite Aid stores accomplishes many of the same goals as the merger - including eliminating Rite Aid as a rival - but does so in a way that makes it harder for the FTC to take the companies to court to stop the transaction, antitrust experts said. A sign marks a Rite Aid pharmacy in Somerville, Massachusetts, U.S., June 29, 2017.Brian Snyder Obviously no victory dance for the FTC today. This was a big stick-it-to-you. They're (the FTC) getting a worse outcome than they would before,  said Andre Barlow of the law firm Doyle, Barlow and Mazard PLLC.  Clearly they (the companies) know what the FTC concerns are. They have likely worked around those issues, which has to be very frustrating for the FTC.  The FTC sued to stop two separate deals last week, suggesting that former administration's tough antitrust approach will continue under President Donald Trump. The agency is being run by Acting Chairwoman Maureen Ohlhausen and three commissioner slots are vacant. The FTC said on Thursday it would review the new proposal. Walgreens to Pay More Per Store Slideshow (5 Images)Rite Aid said the stores to be sold are mainly in the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic and Southeast. The deal also includes distribution centers in Connecticut, Pennsylvania and South Carolina.  Leerink Partners analyst David Larsen estimated that under the new deal, Walgreens would be paying $2.4 million per Rite Aid store, higher than what it would have paid under a previous agreement, where it would have paid $2.04 million to $2.06 million per store.  Walgreens said on Thursday it expects the new deal to close within six months.      Walgreens also reported better-than-expected profit and sales for the third quarter, helped by a rise in prescription volumes in its U.S. pharmacy business.   The company also authorized a $5 billion buyback program and raised the lower end of its full-year profit forecast by 8 cents per share to a range of $4.98 to $5.08. Analysts on average were expecting full-year profit of $4.96 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  The new agreement will assist Rite Aid in addressing pharmacy margin challenges and in significantly reducing debt, the company's CEO John Standley said in a statement.  Walgreens said it would pay Rite Aid a $325 million termination fee. In October 2015, Walgreens said it would buy No. 3 Rite Aid for $9.5 billion.

Republican leaders hope to agree on changes to the legislation by Friday so lawmakers can take it up after next week's Independence Day recess.. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Tuesday abandoned plans to seek passage of it this week because Republicans did not have 50 votes to pass the bill. For seven years, Republicans have led a quest to undo the 2010 law known as Obamacare, Democratic former President Barack Obama's signature legislative achievement. Trump made dismantling it a top campaign promise during last year's presidential campaign but policy differences within the party have raised doubts Republicans can achieve a repeal. Democrats have unified against the bill and Republicans control the Senate by a slim 52-48 margin, which means McConnell can afford to lose only two Republicans. So far at least 10  - including moderates and hard-line conservatives - have expressed opposition to the current bill, although some indicated they would vote for it with certain changes. McConnell, with his reputation as a strategist on the line, met with a procession of Republican senators in his office on Wednesday. John Cornyn, the No. 2 Senate Republican, said party leaders will talk to every Republican senator who has concerns about the bill or is undecided. The House of Representatives passed its healthcare bill last month, only after striking a balance between the center of the party and the right wing. Now McConnell must find a similar sweet spot. During a lunch meeting on Wednesday Republicans made presentations on potential fixes. Senator Rand Paul called for jettisoning more parts of Obamacare to get conservatives on board. Tax Issue Senator Mike Rounds suggested keeping a 3.8 percent Obamacare tax on high earners' investment income, which the current bill would eliminate. Rounds said the tax could pay for more Americans to receive the tax credits that help pay for health insurance. Senator Bob Corker, who also supports keeping the tax, said one of the issues he was focused on was helping lower-income Americans pay for health plans.  My sense is there's a good chance that issue and other issues people are trying to get addressed can be addressed,  Corker told reporters. Trump said the bill was moving along well and predicted a  great, great surprise  but did not elaborate. Maine Senator Susan Collins, a moderate, said it would be  very difficult  to reach agreement by Friday. Collins and other centrists were put off by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office's projection on Monday that 22 million people would lose medical insurance under the existing bill. Finishing the legislation's revisions by Friday would be  optimal,  Cornyn said, so the CBO can analyze the new version. . Even then, Democrats could mount a forceful resistance. They have repeatedly said they will not discuss a repeal but have expressed openness to negotiating improvements. The Senate's top Democrat, Chuck Schumer, proposed Trump call all 100 senators to Blair House across the street from the White House to craft a bipartisan bill fixing Obamacare but Trump said did not think Schumer's offer was serious. McConnell said Democrats had refused  to work with us in a serious way to comprehensively address Obamacare's failures in the seven years since they passed it.  The legislation has triggered protests at the Capitol and police said they arrested 40 people, including cancer survivors, on Wednesday for blocking Senate offices. Obama's 2010 Affordable Care Act, which passed without Republican support, expanded health insurance coverage to some 20 million people but Republicans call it a costly government intrusion. The Senate bill rolls back Obamacare's expansion of the Medicaid government insurance for the poor and cuts planned Medicaid spending starting in 2025. It also repeals most of Obamacare's taxes, ends a penalty for not obtaining insurance and overhauls subsidies that help people buy insurance with tax credits.

Gains for the loonie came after it scored on Wednesday, posting its biggest advance in three months as hawkish comments from Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz helped push Canadian bond yields upward.                  Higher yields tend to increase the return from owning a currency.     Given the  sizable  move higher in yields we are starting to see an unwind of short positions in the Canadian dollar, said Scott Lampard, head of global markets at HSBC Bank Canada.     Data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission and Reuters calculations last week showed that bearish bets on the Canadian dollar had been reduced from record levels in May, but remained at elevated levels.                  Chances of a Bank of Canada rate hike next month have increased to 44 percent from just 20 percent after subdued inflation data on Friday, data from the overnight index swaps market shows           .     Prices of oil, one of Canada's major exports, rose for a sixth straight session after a decline in weekly U.S. production eased concerns about deepening oversupply.     U.S. crude        prices settled 19 cents higher at $44.93 a barrel.           At 4 p.m. EDT (2000 GMT), the Canadian dollar          was trading at C$1.3005 to the greenback, or 76.89 U.S. cents, up 0.3 percent.     The currency's weakest level of the session was C$1.3044, while it touched its strongest since Feb. 2 at C$1.2986.      It isn't just a Canadian dollar story,  it's a broader shift away from the greenback, Lampard said.     The U.S. dollar fell against a basket of major currencies        on growing expectations of more hawkish monetary policies in Europe as well as Canada and on skepticism of another Federal Reserve interest rate increase this year.            Canadian government bond prices were lower across a steeper yield curve in sympathy with U.S. Treasuries and German Bunds.     The 10-year             declined 73 Canadian cents to yield 1.707 percent. The 10-year yield touched its highest intraday since March 21 at 1.715 percent, while the gap between it and its U.S. equivalent narrowed by 3.8 basis points to a spread of -56.1 basis points, its narrowest since Oct. 19, as Canadian government bonds underperformed.

Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of an event in London, Bullard added that it was  disconcerting  that market measures of inflation in the world's largest economy had fallen despite the central bank raising interest rates twice so far this year.  The U.S. is kind of trying to go it alone... which we can do and we certainly have done historically,  Bullard earlier told an event hosted by the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum (OMFIF).  But if you want to go it alone in this environment you have to really have data that's coming in strong behind you and justifying what you want to do.  Bullard, who does not currently vote in the U.S. Federal Reserve's rate-setting committee and is more dovish than many of his peers, questioned how long the Fed could continue on its tightening path while other central banks were still keeping policy easy.  You can go independently - I just think it's hard in this environment with low rates around the world, negative rates in Europe and Japan... how realistic is it for the U.S. to have a (bond) yield curve that is dramatically above our foreign rivals?  Bullard said such differentials in yields -- an indication of where a country can borrow cash on financial markets -- may lead to major moves in the value of the dollar relative to other currencies. Inflation Expectations The Fed's last policy statement flagged concern over a recent fall in the Fed's preferred measure of inflation to 1.5 percent. Fed officials have since then split between those worried the trend may persist and those who feel the Fed needs to tighten still-loose monetary policy as a precaution. Bullard said he was concerned investors appeared to doubt the Fed's ability to generate price growth.  Market-based measures of inflation expectations... have come down since March and normally you would think if the Fed was tightening into good data then the inflation expectations would stay constant.  That's a bit disconcerting for the normalization strategy.  Rather than hiking rates further, Bullard said the Fed's  natural next step  should be to trim its balance sheet -- a process that could take at least five years. He added the Fed was likely to announce plans for balance sheet adjustments at its policy meeting in September, skipping its July meeting where it is not scheduled to hold a press conference.

That will be cut to 9 percent from July 2018 and to zero three years later, the government said in a statement after the parliamentary vote.  A similar bill reforming pensions for civil servants was passed earlier this week, fulfilling a campaign promise by President Tsai Ing-wen.  The reforms are projected by her government to delay the possibility of a default in payments to retirees by a decade. Additional legislation reforming the pension system for the military will be reviewed later.  The plan has angered public sector employees, many of whom say it will ruin their retirement plans. Thousands of military personnel, teachers, police and civil servants have protested against it. Pension reform is critical for Taiwan as large payouts are no longer sustainable for the export-reliant economy, with contributions crimped by slower economic growth and a rapidly aging population. Pensions for civil servants could default by 2030, teachers by 2031, and other workers by 2048, government data shows, if the system is not reformed. Thursday's bill also raised the minimum retirement age for teachers to 58 from 55, the statement said.

On Thursday, the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee adopted legislation that includes Federal Aviation Administration reforms, but unlike a House panel, does not spin off air traffic control and leaves it with the FAA.  The support is not there,  said Senator Bill Nelson, the top Democrat on the panel. The U.S. House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee approved the privatization plan on Tuesday, putting air traffic control under the oversight of a nonprofit corporation. President Donald Trump has said the move would modernize air traffic control and lower flying costs. The proposal has drawn fire from private plane owners and rural airports. Critics say it would hand control of a key asset to special interests and big airlines. American Airlines Group Inc, United Airlines, Southwest Airlines Co and JetBlue Airways Corp all back the proposal. Congress has until Sept. 30 to reauthorize the FAA, but Republican Senator John Thune, chairman of the committee, said the Senate may not take up the proposal until after the August recess, potentially leaving little time to come up with a compromise measure.  The Senate bill would require new rules prohibiting cancellation, baggage, seat selection and same day change fees that are not  reasonable and proportional.  Airlines for America, an airline trade group, said it would result in  government-mandated price controls  and should be rejected. In 2016, U.S. airlines collected $7.1 billion in baggage and reservation change fees. Both measures would make it illegal for an airline to bump an already boarded passenger from a flight. In April, a United passenger was forcibly removed from his seat, prompting public outrage. The airline has since banned the practice. The Senate bill also requires new rules that would mandate  airlines promptly refund passengers for baggage fees or other fees if they do not receive services. The House bill would require the FAA to set minimum seat sizes on U.S. airlines and a minimum distance between rows to  protect the safety and health of airline passengers.  The average distance between rows of seats has dropped from 35 inches in the 1970s to about 31 inches today, supporters say, and the average width of airline seats has shrunk from 18 inches to about 16-1/2 inches. One contentious issue is training requirements for pilots, and whether certain simulated training hours can be counted. Thune said that two-thirds of U.S. airports are only served by regional carriers and that there is a  crisis  in trying to attract pilots, while Democrats said the revised rules could lead to unqualified pilots. Both bills would seek to speed approval of some commercial drone use and testing, while studying privacy implications. The measures also require medium- and large-sized airports to provide clean private rooms in all terminals for nursing mothers and would enshrine a ban on making in-flight mobile phone calls in law. The Senate bill would direct a study of airplane air quality and require a study of whether airlines are shrinking airplane bathrooms to add more seats.

Kluber struck out 12 in eight innings and Lonnie Chisenhall had a pinch-hit, two-run double to lead the Cleveland Indians to a 5-1 victory over the Texas Rangers at Progressive Field. Kluber (7-2) gave up one run on three hits and one walk. He reached double figures in strikeouts for the fourth consecutive start, tying the Indians' record set by Hall of Famer Bob Feller in 1939. Texas starter Andrew Cashner (3-7) gave up five runs on six hits in five innings to take the loss. Texas lost six of the seven games in its season series with Cleveland. The Indians won three of the four games with the Rangers this week, and Thursday's series finale was the Corey Kluber Show. After spending most of the month of May on the disabled list with a strained back, Kluber was activated on June 1, and he has been unbeatable since. In six June starts he was 4-0 with a 1.26 ERA, while averaging 13.4 strikeouts per nine innings and holding opposing batters to a .150 batting average.  We've seen it before when he gets on these kind of rolls, and it seems like he's right there again,  Indians manager Terry Francona said.  And we need it. We've had some ups and down with our rotation, but it seems like Corey is getting on a really good roll now.  Related CoveragePreview: Rangers at IndiansTexas Rangers - PlayerWatchCleveland Indians - PlayerWatchKluber struck out the first two batters in the first inning, but Nomar Mazara pounded an 0-2 pitch over the wall in right field for his 11th home run. It was the Rangers' only run of the game.  Kluber made it very challenging for us,  said Texas manager Jeff Banister.  His breaking ball is a wipeout pitch. He got us to expand our zone, and got lots of swings and misses.  After giving up the home run to Mazara, Kluber retired 21 of the last 24 batters he faced.  You come in with a game plan and then adjust as you go, based on how the hitters are reacting to your pitches,  Kluber said. Cleveland rallied for two runs in the third inning. Yan Gomes led off the inning with a single, and he went to second when Bradley Zimmer beat out a high chopper to second for an infield single. The runners moved to second and third on a wild pitch by Cashner. Gomes scored on a groundout by Francisco Lindor, and Zimmer scored on another wild pitch by Cashner, giving Cleveland a 2-1 lead. The Indians widened their lead in the sixth inning, knocking Cashner out of the game in the process. Michael Brantley led off the inning with a double into the right-field corner. Edwin Encarnacion singled to right, scoring Brantley to push the lead to 3-1. Encarnacion shattered his bat on his hit. The barrel sailed out to the mound and hit Cashner on the right forearm, causing him to fall to the ground. Casher remained in the game, but exited after giving up a double to the next hitter, Jose Ramirez, Cashner sustained a contusion on his forearm, and was taken for precautionary X-rays.  That was scary,  Cashner said.  I didn't even see the bat until it hit me. It's a little sore, but I think I'll be OK.  Nick Martinez relieved Cashner, and Chisenhall greeted him with a double down the right-field line, scoring Encarnacion and Ramirez to make it 5-1. As a pinch hitter this year, Chisenhall is 4-for-14, with two doubles, two home runs and nine RBIs. The nine pinch-hit RBIs lead the American League.  Lonnie does a really good job of being ready to hit right from pitch one, and he's in a good place confidence-wise,  said Francona. It was a tough series for the Texas hitters, who scored just six runs in the last three games.  You don't come in here and expect to put a ton of runs on the board against that pitching staff,  said Banister. NOTES: Indians C Yan Gomes has thrown out a major league-best 46 percent of attempted base stealers (16-of-35). ...

Under its current capital program, the state's Metropolitan Transportation Authority is spending $32.5 billion between 2015 and 2019 to upgrade aging transit infrastructure, improve its communications with commuters, and replace or refurbish its more than 6,000 subway cars.  Nearly half of that spending is for the New York City subway system, with the remainder split between various commuter railroads, bus networks, bridges and tunnels that the MTA operates. Only 63 percent of subway trains are on time so far in 2017, down from 85 percent six years ago, according to MTA data. Just this week, a subway derailment injured 34 people.  The current state of decline is wholly unacceptable,  Cuomo said in a speech at an MTA conference for transit experts.  We know the system is decaying, and we know it's happening rapidly.  FILE PHOTO: Commuters wait to ride New York City Subway in New York, December 12, 2013.Eric Thayer/File PhotoThe $1 billion comes in addition to $8.3 billion in state funding to the MTA's capital program announced last year. Other funding comes from New York City, the federal government and through the sale of bonds.  Cuomo also signed an executive order declaring a state of emergency for the MTA that suspended a number of procurement and environmental regulations for repairs to the system.

Alphonso David, the governor's chief legal counsel, said in a telephone interview that the suspension of these laws was  standard  in emergencies, pointing to similar provisions in recent emergency orders issued by the governor during winter storms. The order would expire in 30 days, but can be renewed as long as the system's disrepair remains an emergency, which could take weeks, months or years, David said.  Riders Alliance, an advocacy group for New York commuters, said $1 billion was welcome but not enough.   The Governor has stopped ignoring the problem, which is a vital first step,  John Raskin, the alliance's director, said in a statement.  Now he needs to produce a credible plan to fix the subway, and to put together the billions of dollars we will need to make it happen.

Fisher,Jeffrey Wall,Paul Clement,OTC,FRANKEL,SCOTUS,Analyses,United States","sector":"Subjects","content":"(Reuters) - It’s always fascinating to see how the U.S. solicitor general’s office attempts to reconcile competing executive-branch interests when it files briefs in U.S. Supreme Court litigation affecting the government’s relationships with foreign sovereigns.  The latest example is the Justice Department’s brief in a dispute over whether about 6,000 non-U.S. citizens can use a 1798 law to sue Jordan’s biggest financial institution, Arab Bank, for allegedly facilitating terrorism. The brief preserves the integrity of the solicitor general’s office by repeating arguments the Justice Department made in a 2012 Supreme Court case that raised the exact same question as the Arab Bank case. But the filing also reflects the U.S. State Department’s concerns about alienating an important ally.  That awkward balance could be an opportunity for Arab Bank to get the Supreme Court to look at a second issue in a case the bank is otherwise almost certain to lose.  The Supreme Court granted review of the case, Jesner v. Arab Bank, to decide whether the Alien Tort Statute can be asserted against corporations. If that question sounds familiar, it’s because the justices agreed to hear the same issue back in 2011, in Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum. The Justice Department, siding with the Nigerian plaintiffs in the Royal Dutch case, submitted a brief arguing that the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals was wrong to hold that corporations cannot be sued under the ATS. It urged the Supreme Court to reverse the 2nd Circuit and rule that corporations can be liable.  Instead, the Supreme Court changed its mind about what the real issue in the case was. The justices called for additional briefing about whether the ATS extends to conduct outside of U.S. borders. The court’s 2013 Kiobel decision held that the ATS presumptively does not apply to overseas conduct but plaintiffs can rebut the presumption by showing “with sufficient force” that their claims “touch and concern the territory of the United States.”  The Supreme Court’s Kiobel decision did not directly address whether corporations can be sued so the 2nd Circuit’s Kiobel ruling remained intact, as the non-U.S. plaintiffs trying to sue Arab Bank discovered to their detriment in 2015. The plaintiffs, all of whom blame the Jordanian bank for allowing Hamas to finance international terror attacks, moved to revive dismissed ATS claims after the Supreme Court’s Kiobel decision. A three-judge 2nd Circuit panel said they still couldn’t sue the bank because Kiobel was still binding 2nd Circuit precedent, and under that precedent, plaintiffs can’t assert the ATS against corporations. In 2016, a splintered en banc 2nd Circuit declined to hear the Arab Bank ATS case.

That will be cut to 9 percent from July 2018 and to zero three years later, the government said in a statement after the parliamentary vote.  A similar bill reforming pensions for civil servants was passed earlier this week, fulfilling a campaign promise by President Tsai Ing-wen.  The reforms are projected by her government to delay the possibility of a default in payments to retirees by a decade. Additional legislation reforming the pension system for the military will be reviewed later.  The plan has angered public sector employees, many of whom say it will ruin their retirement plans. Thousands of military personnel, teachers, police and civil servants have protested against it. Pension reform is critical for Taiwan as large payouts are no longer sustainable for the export-reliant economy, with contributions crimped by slower economic growth and a rapidly aging population. Pensions for civil servants could default by 2030, teachers by 2031, and other workers by 2048, government data shows, if the system is not reformed. Thursday's bill also raised the minimum retirement age for teachers to 58 from 55, the statement said.

On Thursday, the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee adopted legislation that includes Federal Aviation Administration reforms, but unlike a House panel, does not spin off air traffic control and leaves it with the FAA.  The support is not there,  said Senator Bill Nelson, the top Democrat on the panel. The U.S. House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee approved the privatization plan on Tuesday, putting air traffic control under the oversight of a nonprofit corporation. President Donald Trump has said the move would modernize air traffic control and lower flying costs. The proposal has drawn fire from private plane owners and rural airports. Critics say it would hand control of a key asset to special interests and big airlines. American Airlines Group Inc, United Airlines , Southwest Airlines Co and JetBlue Airways Corp all back the proposal. Congress has until Sept. 30 to reauthorize the FAA, but Republican Senator John Thune, chairman of the committee, said the Senate may not take up the proposal until after the August recess, potentially leaving little time to come up with a compromise measure. The Senate bill would require new rules prohibiting cancellation, baggage, seat selection and same day change fees that are not  reasonable and proportional.  Airlines for America, an airline trade group, said it would result in  government-mandated price controls  and should be rejected. In 2016, U.S. airlines collected $7.1 billion in baggage and reservation change fees. Both measures would make it illegal for an airline to bump an already boarded passenger from a flight. In April, a United passenger was forcibly removed from his seat, prompting public outrage. The airline has since banned the practice. The Senate bill also requires new rules that would mandate airlines promptly refund passengers for baggage fees or other fees if they do not receive services. The House bill would require the FAA to set minimum seat sizes on U.S. airlines and a minimum distance between rows to  protect the safety and health of airline passengers.  The average distance between rows of seats has dropped from 35 inches in the 1970s to about 31 inches today, supporters say, and the average width of airline seats has shrunk from 18 inches to about 16-1/2 inches. One contentious issue is training requirements for pilots, and whether certain simulated training hours can be counted. Thune said that two-thirds of U.S. airports are only served by regional carriers and that there is a  crisis  in trying to attract pilots, while Democrats said the revised rules could lead to unqualified pilots. Both bills would seek to speed approval of some commercial drone use and testing, while studying privacy implications. The measures also require medium- and large-sized airports to provide clean private rooms in all terminals for nursing mothers and would enshrine a ban on making in-flight mobile phone calls in law. The Senate bill would direct a study of airplane air quality and require a study of whether airlines are shrinking airplane bathrooms to add more seats.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-aviation-idUSL1N1JQ163"},

The measures also require medium- and large-sized airports to provide clean private rooms in all terminals for nursing mothers and would enshrine a ban on making in-flight mobile phone calls in law. The Senate bill would direct a study of airplane air quality and require a study of whether airlines are shrinking airplane bathrooms to add more seats.

Ali,Seth Williams,William Fitzpatrick,PENNSYLVANIA,PROSECUTOR/,Americas,United States","sector":"","content":"(Reuters) - Philadelphia's top prosecutor on Thursday pleaded guilty to a federal bribery charge and resigned his post, ending seven years in office. The guilty plea, by former Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams, 50, ended a two-week trial. He was indicted in March on 23 charges including bribery and fraud. Williams compromised himself and his elected office by using his office to help  those willing to secretly pay him with valuable items like money, trips, and cars,  as well as by defrauding his political action committee and others, Acting U.S. Attorney William Fitzpatrick said in a statement. Williams, who maintained his innocence until Thursday's hearing, will remain in custody until his sentencing on Oct. 24. He faces a maximum of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine, federal prosecutors said in the statement. Between July 2010 and May 2015, prosecutors said, Williams accepted trips, money and other items of value from a Philadelphia-area businessman, Mohammad N. Ali. In return, the prosecutors said, Williams took steps including  contacting a Philadelphia police official in order to pressure and advise the official to assist Ali with security screenings at the airport.  Williams' attorney, Michael Diamondstein, did not immediately return a call requesting comment on Thursday. Ali, 40, pleaded guilty in May to federal bribery and tax evasion charges. Williams was also accused of soliciting bribes from two business owners that included a sofa, cash, clothing and a trip to Punta Cana, Dominican Republic. The former district attorney, who according to local media reports was led out of the courtroom in handcuffs, agreed in January to pay $62,000 in civil penalties to end a Philadelphia ethics board investigation into his failure to disclose gifts that also included NBA basketball tickets. It was the largest penalty the board imposed in its 10-year history.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/pennsylvania-prosecutor-idUSL1N1JQ1Y3"},

The case offers notable lessons in anti-bribery governance and oversight.  Petrobras did not disclose the terms of the agreement, but the company said it will raise its financial provision for settlements with shareholders to $445 million from $372 million. The oil company has been the target of more than two dozen lawsuits by shareholders in recent years as a result of a massive corruption scheme in which Petrobras executives allegedly took bribes from contractors who had overcharged the company for work. The company claims it was a victim of the graft. Vanguard is one of Petrobras's largest shareholders, a group that includes Brazil's federal government and other agencies of the Brazilian state. The settlement offers some lessons from multiple perspectives: Bribery that is undetected by executives reveals gaps in monitoring, record-keeping and compliance controls, and long-term overbilling by contractors signals corporate lapses in vendor oversight and selection. An effective due-diligence strategy must be a priority for any regulated organization to protect itself and its officers from wrongdoing that represent serious financial and reputational risk. Petrobras Corruption Allegations A government probe of the scandal known as Operation Car Wash has landed several former Petrobras executives and Brazilian politicians in jail.  Launched in March 2014, the operation initially focused on agents known as doleiros (black-market money dealers), who used small businesses, such as petrol stations and car washes, to launder the profits of crime.  Law enforcement soon realized, however, that the doleiros were working on behalf of an executive at Petrobras, Paulo Roberto Costa, the director of refining and supply. This link led prosecutors to uncover a vast and extraordinarily intricate web of corruption.  Under questioning, Costa described how he, Cerveró and other Petrobras directors had been deliberately overpaying on contracts with various companies for office construction, drilling rigs, refineries and exploration vessels. The contractors they were paying had formed an agreement to ensure they were guaranteed business on excessively lucrative terms if they agreed to channel a share of between 1 and 5 percent of every deal into secret slush funds. The scandal also contributed to the downfall of Brazil's former president, Dilma Rousseff. She was ousted by Brazil's Senate last August, ending an impeachment process that polarized her country amid the massive corruption scandal and a brutal economic crisis. While Petrobras has managed to settle with most of the shareholders out of court, a class-action suit in which plaintiffs claim tens of billions of dollars in damages remains active in New York federal court.  At the moment, it isn't possible for Petrobras to make a reliable estimate as to the outcome of the class action,  the company said. Instead, it hid the corruption scheme and  massively overstated its assets and profitability,  leaving shareholders with huge losses after the advertised growth failed to materialize, the suit said. In late April, the company said its board of directors approved settlements to end four individual lawsuits filed in federal court in New York. The plaintiffs in the suits were the New York City Employees Retirement System, Transamerica Income Shares, Inc., Internationale Kapitalanlagegesellschaft, and Lord Abbett Investment Trust--Lord Abbett Short Duration Income Fund. Those four individual lawsuits were consolidated with 23 other individual suits and class actions filed against Petrobras in federal court in New York. To date, Petrobras has resolved 19 individual actions from a total of 27 that were consolidated with the class action losses. The latest Vanguard lawsuit held that Petrobras relied heavily on U.S. securities markets to fuel an ambitious growth plan and  assured investors that it would be transparent and responsible in managing that growth.   Instead, it hid the corruption scheme and  massively overstated its assets and profitability,  leaving shareholders with huge losses after the advertised growth failed to materialize, the suit said. Despite, the long-running corruption ordeal, the Petrobras executive leadership plans to stay put until the end of its mandate in April 2019. Best Practice Reminders It’s easy to get lost in the sums and arcane detail of the Operation Car Wash saga and to miss its enormous offering of best practice pointers. In Brazil, state institutions and private corporate interests are closely entwined, and companies must be mindful of the country's Clean Company Act, enacted in 2014 to counter widespread corruption in both the private and public sectors. Like the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA)(here) and UK Bribery Act(here), the Brazil Clean Company Act[here] allows for extraterritorial reach in some respects, meaning any company doing business in Brazil can be punished, along with its culpable executives. As a result, companies need to make the effort to ensure compliance. This includes training employees on the law and how to report any evidence of transgression, plus knowing how to conduct an investigation of suspected violations, possibly tapping outside experts. The company needs to gather as many facts as possible and consider potential solutions and corrective action for any violations, and consider self-reporting to regulators, after seeking the advice of counsel. Designing an effective anti-corruption compliance program that meets the requirements of many different jurisdictions is not easy. Multinational companies often use the strictest law or laws in any given area of law and regulation and proceed on the basis of satisfy its goals. Such companies can and should also take note of the broad global consensus that has developed around what governments and international organizations expect of corporate anti-corruption compliance programs. These include the Good Practice Guidance for Companies compiled by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development; the U.S. Justice Department's and SEC's Resource Guide [here] to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA Guide); and guidance provided by the World Bank, International Chamber of Commerce [here] and Transparency International[here]. The commonly accepted core components of an effective anti-corruption program include: -- Support and commitment from the top. Senior management and boards of directors should create a corporate culture that promotes and publicly rewards compliance. In evaluating a company's compliance, U.S. authorities say they will consider  whether senior management has clearly articulated company standards, communicated them in unambiguous terms, adhered to them scrupulously, and disseminated them throughout the organization.  With this said, a commitment to compliance must be reinforced by managers throughout the organization and documented by compliance staff. -- Oversight by compliance officers equipped with autonomy, resources and authority. The responsible corporate officer (or officers)  must have appropriate authority within the organization, adequate autonomy from management, and sufficient resources to ensure that the company's compliance program is implemented effectively,  the FCPA Guide states.  Best practice also dictates designation of a corporate officer and establishment a department or structural unit responsible for the prevention of corruption and related offenses. -- Generally applicable compliance measures focused on high-risk areas. An effective program,  should be developed on the basis of a risk assessment addressing the individual circumstances of a company.  High-risk areas, like gifts; hospitality, entertainment and expenses; customer travel; political contributions; charitable donations and sponsorships, should receive the closest scrutiny and periodic investigations with a thorough reporting of their results. -- Ensuring the compliance of third parties. Companies must perform documented due diligence of business partners, inform business partners of the company's commitment to compliance, seek a reciprocal commitment, and monitor continued compliance. Anti-corruption rules are only effective if they are enforced, and this must mean with contractors as well as employees. Their adherence to such laws is integral to the soundness of the hiring company and its reputation, and any pledges must be backed up with demonstrable action -- evidence the hiring firm must require at intervals. -- Accounting procedures, including a system of internal controls. Internal controls that are crafted to alert the business when policies, procedures and legal obligations are being violated is integral, as are periodic audits, to ensure the integrity of a company's operations. These targeted audits make certain that controls on paper are working in practice. -- Confidential reporting and whistleblower portals. An effective program must provide resources for company employees and contractors to obtain compliance information, answer questions, and be able to report potential or actual misconduct. --World Bank guidance:here (Julie DiMauro is a regulatory intelligence expert in the Enterprise Risk Management division of Thomson Reuters Regulatory Intelligence.

The technology sector .SPLRCT, which has led the S&P; 500's 8-percent gain for the year, dropped 1.8 percent, and were the worst-performing major group. Declines in big tech stocks, including Apple (AAPL.O) and Microsoft (MSFT.O), weighed the most on the benchmark S&P.; Financials .SPSY and energy .SPNY were the only sectors in positive territory as investors may have been rotating into groups that have lagged this year.  U.S. equities have remained extended, at or close to record territory for an extended period of time really without a tremendous amount of conviction in the market,  said Peter Kenny, senior market strategist at Global Markets Advisory Group, in New York.  It’s really been treading water. Without a major stimulus to drive prices higher, equities have to reset and that’s what they’re doing today,  Kenny said. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 167.58 points, or 0.78 percent, to 21,287.03, the S&P; 500 .SPX lost 20.99 points, or 0.86 percent, to 2,419.7 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 90.06 points, or 1.44 percent, to 6,144.35. The Nasdaq closed below its 50-day moving average for the first time since April 13, breaking below a key technical support level. The CBOE Volatility index .VIX, the widely followed barometer of expected near-term stock market volatility, rose to a six-week high of 15.16, before paring some of the move. Equity investors also may be concerned about the rise in interest rates globally, as a slew of hawkish comments from central banks signaled the beginning of the end of ultra-loose monetary policy. European stocks also declined. With the second quarter coming to a close, the market has experienced a volatile few days. Just on Wednesday, the tech-heavy Nasdaq had posted its best day since Nov. 7. Financials were the bright spot for the stock market, rising 0.7 percent.

Wells Fargo (WFC.N) shares rose 2.7 percent while Citigroup (C.N) gained 2.8 percent. Energy inched 0.1 percent higher. Oil prices CLc1 edged up after a decline in weekly U.S. crude production temporarily eased concerns about oversupply.  There's a slight rotation,  said Omar Aguilar, chief investment officer for equities at Charles Schwab Investment Management.  You see the sectors that are underperforming are the ones that have done the best. Tech stocks are feeling the pain today, but it's more of a technical reversal.   Investors have been concerned about tepid U.S. economic growth as the Fed is raising interest rates from very low levels. Data showed the U.S. economy slowed less sharply in the first quarter than initially estimated due to unexpectedly higher consumer spending and a bigger jump in exports.  In corporate news, Rite Aid (RAD.N) shares slumped 26.5 percent after Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA.O) scrapped its deal to buy Rite Aid after failing to win antitrust approval, but said it would instead buy nearly half of the smaller rival's U.S. stores. Walgreens also ended a related deal to sell as many as 1,200 Rite Aid stores to Fred's Inc (FRED.O), sending Fred's shares down 22.8 percent. Walgreens shares rose 1.7 percent.

The official told Reuters that Mohammed bin Nayef, a veteran interior minister, was continuing to host guests and there were no restrictions at all on his or his family's movements. Mohammed bin Nayef, who was admired in Washington for quashing an al Qaeda insurgency in the kingdom between 2003 and 2006, was relieved of all his duties a week ago. In his place as Crown Prince, King Salman appointed his son Mohammed bin Salman who also serves as defense minister and leads an ambitious reform agenda to end Saudi Arabia's over-reliance on oil.               Mohammed bin Salman's promotion ended two years of speculation about a behind-the-scenes rivalry near the pinnacle of royal power, but analysts said he still has to win over powerful relatives, clerics and tribesmen. The New York Times, citing four current and former American officials and Saudis close to the royal family, said  Mohammed bin Nayef has been  barred from leaving the kingdom and confined to his palace  in the Red Sea city of Jeddah. Reuters could not reach Mohammed bin Nayef for comment. But the senior Saudi official expressed shock at the report, which he described as a  fabricated story  and suggested that Mohammed bin Nayef may seek legal action against the newspaper.  What was published by the New York Times is untrue, completely false, and baseless,  the official told Reuters, responding to a question on the New York Times report.  His Royal Highness Prince Mohammed bin Nayef and his family is moving freely and hosting his guests unrestrictedly. Nothing has changed for Prince Mohammed, except for stepping down from his government positions,  the official said.  He hosts guests and leaves his house on a daily basis since he has stepped down. Further, there are no restrictions on his movement whatsoever, either in or outside of Saudi Arabia.  A State Department spokesperson said the United States was  aware of reports that Prince Mohammed bin Nayef is being confined , but would not comment on the accuracy of the reports. The spokesperson added that Mohammed bin Nayef  has been a key partner and helped strengthen the foundation for counterterrorism and security cooperation between the United States and Saudi Arabia . Although Mohammed bin Salman's promotion to crown prince had long been expected among those who follow the royal family closely, the timing was a surprise, and puts the kingdom's future in relatively untested hands. The promotion proceeded smoothly, with royal family members, senior officials and clerics participating in a traditional ceremony held in the Muslim holy city of Mecca in which they pledged allegiance to the new crown prince.      Saudi state media, eager to show the change was going smoothly, repeatedly broadcast footage of the young Mohammed bin Salman kissing the hand of Mohammed bin Nayef, as his older cousin offered him congratulations. The Saudi official said Mohammed bin Nayef was  entitled to bring legal action against the newspaper and anyone who defames his reputation by publishing such false news about him .

Under its current capital program, the state's Metropolitan Transportation Authority is spending $32.5 billion between 2015 and 2019 to upgrade aging transit infrastructure, improve its communications with commuters, and replace or refurbish its more than 6,000 subway cars.  Nearly half of that spending is for the New York City subway system, with the remainder split between various commuter railroads, bus networks, bridges and tunnels that the MTA operates. Only 63 percent of subway trains are on time so far in 2017, down from 85 percent six years ago, according to MTA data. Just this week, a subway derailment injured 34 people.  The current state of decline is wholly unacceptable,  Cuomo said in a speech at an MTA conference for transit experts.  We know the system is decaying, and we know it's happening rapidly.  FILE PHOTO: Commuters wait to ride New York City Subway in New York, December 12, 2013.Eric Thayer/File PhotoThe $1 billion comes in addition to $8.3 billion in state funding to the MTA's capital program announced last year. Other funding comes from New York City, the federal government and through the sale of bonds.  Cuomo also signed an executive order declaring a state of emergency for the MTA that suspended a number of procurement and environmental regulations for repairs to the system.

Alphonso David, the governor's chief legal counsel, said in a telephone interview that the suspension of these laws was  standard  in emergencies, pointing to similar provisions in recent emergency orders issued by the governor during winter storms. The order would expire in 30 days, but can be renewed as long as the system's disrepair remains an emergency, which could take weeks, months or years, David said.  Riders Alliance, an advocacy group for New York commuters, said $1 billion was welcome but not enough.   The Governor has stopped ignoring the problem, which is a vital first step,  John Raskin, the alliance's director, said in a statement.  Now he needs to produce a credible plan to fix the subway, and to put together the billions of dollars we will need to make it happen.

Kabila was due to address the nation on Thursday on the eve of independence day. Instead, scrolling text on screen attributed to Kabila read:  I regret that, for reasons of health, I cannot this year address to you my message in the usual manner.  An adviser to Kabila told Reuters earlier the government would not hold its annual independence day military parade on Friday because of security concerns. In the capital Kinshasa, unknown assailants with firearms and machetes attacked a prison. National police spokesman Colonel Pierre Mwanamputu said police killed one of the  bandits  and captured three others. Four officers were wounded and some prisoners escaped, he said, but did not say how many. Police and diplomatic sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a police officer was killed in the clashes in Kinshasa's bustling Matonge neighborhood. Dozens of heavily-armed police and soldiers were deployed to the area and security was reinforced around the state television building several kilometers away.   There was gunfire. I saw a woman wounded in her leg by a bullet,  said one witness who asked not to be named.    Thousands of inmates have escaped from jails this year in Congo, including about 4,000 from Kinshasa's main high-security prison last month in an attack blamed on a separatist sect from southwest Congo. The raids have underscored the deteriorating security situation in the wake of Kabila's refusal to step down at the end of his mandate in December.  Rising militia violence and a humanitarian crisis have unsettled Africa's largest copper producer in recent months and raised fears of a return to the civil wars of the turn of the century that killed millions.  Fighting between government forces and a local militia in the central Kasai region has killed more than 3,300 people and forced 1.3 million to flee their homes since August. Independence day parades have been held in each of the last three years to mark the end of Belgian colonial rule in 1960 and have been used to show off the central African country's latest arms acquisitions.

The New York Legislature faced a Friday deadline for passing the measure or school control would have reverted back to local school boards. Lawmakers had begun their summer vacation last week when Governor Andrew Cuomo summoned them to a special session on the bill.  Before dawn on Thursday, the Assembly passed the school control bill 115 to 15.  Also tied into the voting were deals allowing a three-year extension for local sales taxes and a $55 million flood recovery grant for residents of New York's Lake Ontario coastline and other infrastructure plans. The Senate passed the bill at midday on Thursday. Mayoral control of New York City's schools began in 2002 to increase accountability. Mayor Michael Bloomberg convinced the legislature to grant him control for seven years and a six-year extension in 2009.  Mayor de Blasio, who is up for reelection in November, has been granted only annual renewals by lawmakers who have used that leverage to strike political deals.  A two-year extension of mayoral control ensures continuity and stability for New York City’s public school students,  said state Senator Jeff Klein, a Democrat from New York City's borough of the Bronx. In the flurry of activity, Cuomo also secured the legislature's approval to rename the Tappan Zee Bridge over the Hudson River in Westchester County after his father, former New York Governor Mario Cuomo.  The deal making irked some lawmakers, including Republican Senator James Tedisco of Glenville, who voted against the bill because he was opposed to renaming the Tappan Zee bridge.  “I am not supporting or voting on this bill to commemorate a governor or assembly men. I will support commemorating a war hero with the work we’re doing today,” Tedisco said. Reporting by Riham Alkousaa","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-new-york-education-idUSKBN19K2WT"},

The 2.7 percent increase in output versus May 2016 was below median expectations in a Reuters poll of analysts for a 3.5 percent increase. The positive reading was nonetheless welcome in a country hit by high inflation that has reduced domestic consumption and weakness in main trade partner Brazil. Industrial activity has fallen a cumulative 1.4 percent so far this year compared with the first five months of 2016, after a 4.6 percent decline overall last year.  The turnaround, if sustained, could provide a boost to President Mauricio Macri's efforts to spur growth, seen at around 3 percent in 2017 by the government. Overall economic activity fell 2.2 percent last year but has grown 0.4 percent in the first four months of the year. Macri has been hard put to deliver on promises of attracting  investment needed to get the economy moving ahead of the October mid-term vote, which will determine the power he will have in Congress to push through market-friendly reforms in the second half of his term. The rebound in industrial production in May was driven by a 17.4 percent year-over-year increase in the automotive sector and a 3.9 percent increase in food production. Output of steel and cement - crucial inputs for a fast-growing construction sector - also posted strong growth.  Struggling industries such as textiles and tobacco continued to decline, falling 13.3 and 15.2 percent, respectively.  May's official economic activity figures have not yet been released.

The official told Reuters that Mohammed bin Nayef, a veteran interior minister, was continuing to host guests and there were no restrictions at all on his or his family's movements. Mohammed bin Nayef, who was admired in Washington for quashing an al Qaeda insurgency in the kingdom between 2003 and 2006, was relieved of all his duties a week ago. In his place as Crown Prince, King Salman appointed his son Mohammed bin Salman who also serves as defense minister and leads an ambitious reform agenda to end Saudi Arabia's over-reliance on oil.               Mohammed bin Salman's promotion ended two years of speculation about a behind-the-scenes rivalry near the pinnacle of royal power, but analysts said he still has to win over powerful relatives, clerics and tribesmen. The New York Times, citing four current and former American officials and Saudis close to the royal family, said  Mohammed bin Nayef has been  barred from leaving the kingdom and confined to his palace  in the Red Sea city of Jeddah. Reuters could not reach Mohammed bin Nayef for comment. But the senior Saudi official expressed shock at the report, which he described as a  fabricated story  and suggested that Mohammed bin Nayef may seek legal action against the newspaper.  What was published by the New York Times is untrue, completely false, and baseless,  the official told Reuters, responding to a question on the New York Times report.  His Royal Highness Prince Mohammed bin Nayef and his family is moving freely and hosting his guests unrestrictedly. Nothing has changed for Prince Mohammed, except for stepping down from his government positions,  the official said.  He hosts guests and leaves his house on a daily basis since he has stepped down. Further, there are no restrictions on his movement whatsoever, either in or outside of Saudi Arabia.  A State Department spokesperson said the United States was  aware of reports that Prince Mohammed bin Nayef is being confined , but would not comment on the accuracy of the reports. The spokesperson added that Mohammed bin Nayef  has been a key partner and helped strengthen the foundation for counterterrorism and security cooperation between the United States and Saudi Arabia . Although Mohammed bin Salman's promotion to crown prince had long been expected among those who follow the royal family closely, the timing was a surprise, and puts the kingdom's future in relatively untested hands. The promotion proceeded smoothly, with royal family members, senior officials and clerics participating in a traditional ceremony held in the Muslim holy city of Mecca in which they pledged allegiance to the new crown prince.      Saudi state media, eager to show the change was going smoothly, repeatedly broadcast footage of the young Mohammed bin Salman kissing the hand of Mohammed bin Nayef, as his older cousin offered him congratulations.

Trump, who often decries what he calls  fake news  in the American media and who this week attacked CNN, the New York Times and the Washington Post, took fierce aim on Thursday at the hosts of the MSNBC program  Morning Joe,  Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski. The Republican president called Brzezinski, a journalist and daughter of former White House national security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski,  low I.Q. Crazy Mika  and said she was  bleeding badly from a face-lift  when she visited his Mar-A-Lago estate around New Year's Eve. He referred to former Republican U.S. Congressman Scarborough as  Psycho Joe.  Trump is known for his prolific Twitter habit, which includes mocking attacks on critics and rivals, but his tweets on Thursday drew a particularly strong response.  It's a sad day for America when the president spends his time bullying, lying and spewing petty personal attacks instead of doing his job,  MSNBC's communications office said on Twitter.  The  Morning Joe  program broadcast live telephone interviews with Trump during the 2016 presidential race, but its hosts have turned increasingly critical of him since he took office in January. On Thursday's show, Brzezinski excoriated the Trump administration and said its officials should not act  lobotomized  because they are scared of the president. Comcast Corp owns NBCUniversal, MSNBC's parent company. Lawmakers in both parties rebuked Trump.  I don't see that as an appropriate comment,  Republican House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said of Trump's tweets, saying they do not help improve civility in Washington. The tweets represent  what is wrong with American politics, not the greatness of America,  said Republican Senator Lindsey Graham. Republican senator Ben Sasse called Trump's remarks  beneath the dignity of your office.  MSNBC's Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski arrive for the annual White House Correspondents' Association dinner in Washington April 25, 2015.Jonathan ErnstNancy Pelosi, the top Democrat in the House of Representatives, on Twitter called Trump's tweets  sexist, an assault on the freedom of the press & an insult to all women.     At a briefing, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders called it a  false narrative  to portray Trump's remarks as  an attack on a woman  rather than on a critic, adding,  What about the constant attacks that he receives?   He's not going to sit back and get attacked by the liberal media, Hollywood elites. And when they hit him, he's going to hit back,  Sanders said.  I don't think it's a surprise to anybody that he fights fire with fire.  U.S. President Donald Trump talks to the media during his meeting with immigration crime victims at the White House in Washington, U.S., June 28, 2017.Yuri GripasAttacks on Media The tweets created an uproar in Washington and a distraction as Republican senators tried to bridge differences within the party and agree on major healthcare legislation. A wealthy businessman and former reality TV star with no previous experience in government, Trump has been quick to respond to criticism of his presidency, lashing out at the media for its coverage of probes into potential collusion between his campaign team and Russia, and other matters. He has sometimes singled out individual journalists, including a high-profile attack while he was running for office on former Fox News and current NBC journalist Megyn Kelly. That included a comment about  blood coming out of her wherever,  which was widely interpreted as a reference to menstruation. Trump has been criticized in the past for his comments about women. He attacked Kelly after she asked him during a presidential debate about his previous references to some women as  fat pigs, dogs, slobs and disgusting animals.  Trump apologized last October, just before the election, after a 2005 video surfaced in which he said he could grab women by their genitals whenever he wanted because he was a star. Trump has been critical before of the  Morning Joe  hosts, but Thursday's attack was especially harsh. Scarborough and Brzezinski are engaged to be married. During the January meeting at the Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, Trump offered to host their wedding and even to officiate it, the two said in an interview in Vanity Fair published in May.

Responsibility for examining the environmental impact of projects on federally-regulated land in Canada is shared between three separate entities, a system that the Liberal government says the public does not trust. Government plans released on Thursday mean the much-criticised national energy regulator would lose its power to assess natural resource projects. Aboriginal and environmental protesters currently trying to block major pipelines have long complained the National Energy Board is too close to the industry.  This is all about rebuilding public trust in how we make decisions on major projects that are important to our economy,  said a government official who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the press. The official said the government was currently thinking about giving overall responsibility for probes to the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency. Protracted protests last year forced Ottawa to veto one major pipeline from Alberta's oil sands to the Pacific Coast and are dragging out study of another line to the Atlantic. Canada needs to get its landlocked crude to its east and west coasts to avoid pipeline bottlenecks that leave Canadian oil trading at a discount. Under the plans, the new assessment body would pay more attention to the long-term implications of a project and the views of aboriginal populations as well as allowing public comments much earlier in the process. The government would retain final responsibility for deciding whether a project could go ahead. Even if the new body were created it would have little immediate impact on the energy sector. Existing projects, such as TransCanada Corp's proposed Energy East pipeline from Alberta to the Atlantic Coast, will be assessed by the NEB under current rules. The government plans to introduce draft legislation later this year to implement the changes and hopes they will become law in 2018. Reuters reported last year that the Liberal government would consider stripping the NEB of sole oversight for new projects.

Every 1 degree Celsius rise in global temperatures will cost the United States as a whole about 1.2 percent of its Gross Domestic Product, researchers said in the journal Science. But the economic damage will be unequally spread. Colder and richer areas in the north may benefit from improved health and agriculture and lower energy costs, researchers said. But the poorest third of counties in the nation could sustain damages costing as much as a fifth of their income.    Unmitigated climate change will be very expensive for huge regions of the United States,  said Solomon Hsiang, a professor of public policy at the University of California, Berkeley.   If we continue on the current path, our analysis indicates it may result in the largest transfer of wealth from the poor to the rich in the country's history,  he said. The team of economists and climate scientists calculated how agriculture, crime, health, energy demand, labor and coastal communities will be affected by higher temperatures, changing rainfall, rising seas and intensifying hurricanes. For example, if emissions continue at their current rate, the Midwest could by the end of the century see agricultural losses similar to those suffered during the Dustbowl period of the 1930s, said study co-author Amir Jina of the University of Chicago. At that time, a wave of dust storms crippled agriculture over a vast area of the Great Plains and led to an exodus of people, many to California. The Gulf Coast, too, is likely to be badly hit by rising sea level, destructive hurricanes and extreme heat, the researchers said.  In the absence of major efforts to reduce emissions and strengthen resilience, the Gulf Coast will take a massive hit,  said Robert Kopp, professor of earth and planetary sciences at Rutgers University-New Brunswick.   Its exposure to sea-level rise - made worse by potentially stronger hurricanes - poses a major risk to its communities. Increasingly extreme heat will drive up violent crime, slow down workers, amp up air conditioning costs, and threaten people's lives,  he added. Previous research has found that violent crime rises and productivity falls when people experience higher than usual temperatures, Kopp told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  The researchers used 116 climate projections developed by scientists around the world to price the impacts of climate change by means similar to those used by the insurance industry or investors to compare risks and rewards.  We are making decisions today about the kinds of lives we and our children want to lead,  said James Rising, a postdoctoral fellow at University of California, Berkeley. Risk analysis - done with the aid of computers - is allowing researchers to  see the economic hole we're digging for ourselves,  he said.

U.S. District Court Judge Sarah Evans Barker issued a preliminary injunction late on Wednesday against portions of measure signed in April by Indiana Governor Eric Holcomb. Indiana law already required parental consent for minors unless a judge provided a waiver known as a  judicial bypass.  The new law allowed the judge to notify parents if the waiver is granted, and was scheduled to take effect July 1. Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky and the American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana sued to stop the law in May, arguing it created an unconstitutional burden on minors and would create a chilling effect. Indiana Attorney General Curtis Hill is reviewing the ruling to determine whether to appeal, spokesman Corey Elliot said in an interview.  Wednesday's injunction essentially encourages a minor to go it alone through the emotionally and physically overwhelming procedure of aborting a human being,  Hill said in a statement.  We will always support the authority of parents to know what is going on with their children.  The judge also blocked provisions that barred abortion clinics from talking with teens about options in other states, and more stringent identification requirements for parents before their child gets an abortion.  This decision affirms that the state must continue to provide a safe alternative for young women who - whatever their circumstances - are unable to talk to their parents about this difficult and personal decision,  ACLU of Indiana Legal Director Ken Falk said in a statement. The Indiana State Department of Health recorded 244 abortions in 2015 of girls aged 10 to 17, roughly 3 percent of the state total. The U.S. Supreme Court has held that a minor who is unable or unwilling to obtain parental consent for an abortion must be allowed to proceed if a judge determines that she is sufficiently mature to make the decision herself or that an abortion is in her best interest, the ACLU said.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/indiana-abortion-idUSL1N1JQ1MH"},

Kabila was due to address the nation on Thursday on the eve of independence day. Instead, scrolling text on screen attributed to Kabila read:  I regret that, for reasons of health, I cannot this year address to you my message in the usual manner.  An adviser to Kabila told Reuters earlier the government would not hold its annual independence day military parade on Friday because of security concerns. In the capital Kinshasa, unknown assailants with firearms and machetes attacked a prison. National police spokesman Colonel Pierre Mwanamputu said police killed one of the  bandits  and captured three others. Four officers were wounded and some prisoners escaped, he said, but did not say how many. Police and diplomatic sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a police officer was killed in the clashes in Kinshasa's bustling Matonge neighborhood. Dozens of heavily-armed police and soldiers were deployed to the area and security was reinforced around the state television building several kilometers away.   There was gunfire. I saw a woman wounded in her leg by a bullet,  said one witness who asked not to be named.    Thousands of inmates have escaped from jails this year in Congo, including about 4,000 from Kinshasa's main high-security prison last month in an attack blamed on a separatist sect from southwest Congo. The raids have underscored the deteriorating security situation in the wake of Kabila's refusal to step down at the end of his mandate in December.  Rising militia violence and a humanitarian crisis have unsettled Africa's largest copper producer in recent months and raised fears of a return to the civil wars of the turn of the century that killed millions.  Fighting between government forces and a local militia in the central Kasai region has killed more than 3,300 people and forced 1.3 million to flee their homes since August.

U.N. chief Antonio Guterres and the African Union (AU) had recommended the move to the 15-member Security Council in a report last month. The council unanimously adopted a resolution on Thursday that could also cut police by more than a quarter. Conflict in Darfur began in 2003 when mainly non-Arab tribes took up arms against Sudan's Arab-led government. A joint AU/U.N. peacekeeping operation, known as UNAMID, has been on the ground for the past decade. The United Nations says up to 300,000 people have been killed and millions displaced during the conflict.  Under the U.N. resolution adopted on Thursday, the troop ceiling will be cut to 11,395 from 15,485 in the first six months and the maximum police level would be reduced to 2,888 from 3,403. The council also asked Guterres and the AU to submit an assessment by Jan. 1, 2018. That report would review implementation of the drawdown and impact on protection of civilians and access to aid, cooperation of the Sudanese government with the mission and  whether conditions on the ground remain conducive to further reductions.   Unless the Security Council decides otherwise, the peacekeeping mission would then cut its number further during the first half of 2018 to 8,735 troops and 2,500 police.  The council said there was a  need to keep the situation in all areas of Darfur under review  and that the  reconfiguration of UNAMID has to be effectively mitigated by an improved ability to respond to threats quickly and adequately.  The drawdown comes as the United States presses the United Nations to cut costs and become more efficient. U.N. states struck a deal on Wednesday on a $7.3 billion annual peacekeeping budget, diplomats said, cutting $600 million from current costs. In January, the United States gave Sudan 180 days to improve its human rights record and resolve its political and military conflicts before Washington lifts some major unilateral economic sanctions. The United States first imposed sanctions on Sudan in 1997, including a trade embargo and blocking the government's assets, for human rights violations and terrorism concerns. It layered on more sanctions in 2006 for what it said was complicity in the violence in Darfur.

New York will get about 250 new workers with the move, while Aetna will keep thousands of jobs in Connecticut and hold on to its Hartford campus. It has about 6,000 employees in the state, most of them in the Hartford area, where it has been located for more than 160 years. The move comes after Aetna and General Electric publicly criticized the state of Connecticut in 2015 for its taxes and business climate. Later that year, Aetna agreed to be bought by Humana Inc , and a decision about its headquarters was delayed. General Electric announced last year that it was moving its headquarters to Boston from Fairfield, Connecticut. The Humana deal was terminated earlier this year. A few months later, Aetna said it was considering several locations for a new headquarters. After the move to the new building in Manhattan, Aetna will have between 1,000 and 2,000 employees in New York. New York City will provide a $9.6 million assistance package, the city said in a news release. Regarding its operations in Connecticut, the company said on its website,  Aetna’s long-term commitment to Connecticut will be based on the state’s economic health.

U.S. District Court Judge Sarah Evans Barker issued a preliminary injunction late on Wednesday against portions of measure signed in April by Indiana Governor Eric Holcomb. Indiana law already required parental consent for minors unless a judge provided a waiver known as a  judicial bypass.  The new law allowed the judge to notify parents if the waiver is granted, and was scheduled to take effect July 1. Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky and the American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana sued to stop the law in May, arguing it created an unconstitutional burden on minors and would create a chilling effect. Indiana Attorney General Curtis Hill is reviewing the ruling to determine whether to appeal, spokesman Corey Elliot said in an interview. FILE PHOTO: A girl is carried as healthcare activists with Planned Parenthood and the Center for American Progress protest in opposition to the Senate Republican healthcare bill on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., on June 28, 2017.Joshua Roberts/File Photo Wednesday's injunction essentially encourages a minor to go it alone through the emotionally and physically overwhelming procedure of aborting a human being,  Hill said in a statement.  We will always support the authority of parents to know what is going on with their children.  The judge also blocked provisions that barred abortion clinics from talking with teens about options in other states, and more stringent identification requirements for parents before their child gets an abortion.      This decision affirms that the state must continue to provide a safe alternative for young women who - whatever their circumstances - are unable to talk to their parents about this difficult and personal decision,  ACLU of Indiana Legal Director Ken Falk said in a statement. The Indiana State Department of Health recorded 244 abortions in 2015 of girls aged 10 to 17, roughly 3 percent of the state total. The U.S. Supreme Court has held that a minor who is unable or unwilling to obtain parental consent for an abortion must be allowed to proceed if a judge determines that she is sufficiently mature to make the decision herself or that an abortion is in her best interest, the ACLU said.

The inquiry focuses on Good Days, which operates a co-pay assistance program that it says since 2003 has provided more than $1 billion in assistance to patients to buy expensive drugs for chronic and terminal diseases. The Texas-based charity, previously known as Chronic Disease Fund Inc, has since February filed several lawsuits in federal courts in three states and the District of Columbia to quash summonses the IRS served on drug companies that donated to it. In court papers, the IRS said that in 2011, about 95 percent of the $129.3 million in assistance the charity provided patients to cover co-pays was spent on drugs made by the companies that had made donations for specific diseases.  In other words, the vast majority of funds that are 'donated' by a pharmaceutical manufacturer are returned to it in the form of co-pay assistance,  Cathy Tai, an IRS agent, said in court papers. The IRS sent summonses to Novartis AG, Roche Holding AG's Genentech unit, Johnson & Johnson, Bayer AG, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd and Biogen Inc seeking information about donations to Good Days, court papers show. Robert Zinkham, a lawyer for Good Days, said it has been undergoing an IRS audit for almost four years. Good Days in court papers said it is  fully independent  from its donors. Bayer and Novartis said they are cooperating with the IRS. Genentech said it acts in accordance with the law. J&J; said it has no control over such charities. Other companies did not respond to requests for comment. Bloomberg first reported the IRS inquiry. As drug price increases have drawn the ire of politicians and the healthcare industry, concern has grown that donations from pharmaceutical companies to patient-assistance groups may be contributing to price inflation. Drug companies are prohibited from subsidizing co-payments for patients enrolled in government healthcare programs like Medicare. But they may donate to non-profits that provide co-pay assistance as long as they are independent from the companies. Several drugmakers have disclosed they received subpoenas from the U.S. Attorney's Office in Massachusetts related to their support for patient-assistance charities. Zinkham said Good Days also received a subpoena but the probe appeared unrelated to the IRS audit.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-pharmaceuticals-charity-idUSL1N1JQ1UL"},

Using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scans and academic indicators, the study team found differences in the brains of kids growing up in the most disadvantaged environments. But those with supportive parents showed brain development more like that of peers who were less disadvantaged. “Society is struggling with righting equality, particularly economic equality,” said senior study author Nick Allen, a psychology professor at the University of Oregon in Eugene who is also affiliated with the University of Melbourne. “We know from social science that being raised in a socioeconomically disadvantaged environment is bad for development,” he told Reuters Health in a phone interview. “What we’re trying to understand now is how children are affected and what we can do about it.” The researchers analyzed data on 166 adolescents between ages 11 and 20 in Melbourne who were participating in a larger study. All the kids had up to three MRI brain scans at early, middle and late adolescence, and researchers also assessed their family and neighborhood socioeconomic environments, academic success and characteristics of their parents.  The examination of parents included educational level, income and the family’s socioeconomic status within the immediate surrounding neighborhood of about 250 homes. To gauge parenting behaviors, researchers observed as the adolescents and their mothers completed two 20-minute interactions such as event-planning or problem-solving tasks that displayed verbal and nonverbal reactions. Parental behaviors considered to be positive included approving, validating, affectionate or humorous comments.  The research team found that neighborhood, but not family-level, economic measures were associated with differences in brain development between early adolescence and the late teen years. The most disadvantaged kids showed differences from others in the brain’s temporal lobes in particular, which could affect stress, memory and language, the study authors write in JAMA Psychiatry. “Adolescence is an important time for the development of the brain, particularly in terms of factors that influence your life and the ability to regulate behavior and form relationships,” Allen said. Positive parenting behaviors, however, seemed to moderate the negative effects of the poor environment, especially in the brain region known as the amygdala, which has a central role in regulating emotions.  In contrast, the combination of growing up in a disadvantaged neighborhood and low parental positivity was linked to increased odds of dropping out of school, primarily among boys.  “We were surprised to find that parenting can actually change development and behaviors,” Allen said. “We still need to work for political and social change to lift people out of poverty, but supporting families could be part of that picture.” Limitations of the study include the fact that parenting and socioeconomic circumstances were only assessed at one time point, the authors note. They also didn’t have data on brain development and other factors prior to adolescence that could influence the results. The study also doesn’t prove that poverty caused the brain differences seen among teens, or the changes seen over time in individual children.  Still, this link between environment and biology continues the conversation about the increased risks associated with low socioeconomic status, such as poor mental health, physical health, school readiness, academic success, high school completion and career opportunities, said Jamie Hanson of the University of Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania, who wasn’t involved in the study. “We’re just starting to realize more and more about the effects of different experiences on the brain,” he told Reuters Health by phone. “It speaks to how experience becomes biologically embedded in us.” The next research step is to work with those disadvantaged communities and families, he added. In Pittsburgh, for example, neighborhood community redevelopment programs are beginning to reach out to families to get them more involved in family and community activities. “Parents can be a powerful source of change,” Hanson said. “They have the agency to help their kids, even under challenging circumstances.” SOURCE: bit.ly/2t60WHk JAMA Psychiatry, online June 21, 2017.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-adolecents-brain-parenting-idUSKBN19K2VG"},

NNPC, in an emailed statement, said under the agreement Schlumberger would provide the $700 million investment in developing the fields, which would add 193 million barrels of crude to current reserves. The state oil company said it would also add 800 billion cubic feet of gas to Nigeria's proven gas reserves. Nigeria has the world's ninth largest gas reserves, at 187 trillion cubic feet (tcf).  In terms of daily production, the fields will yield 50,000 barrels of crude oil per day and 120 million standard cubic feet of gas per day by early 2019,  NNPC spokesman Ndu Ughamadu said in the statement.   The state oil company said OMLs 83 and 85 were located in shallow waters 40 km (25 miles) offshore.

U.N. chief Antonio Guterres and the African Union (AU) had recommended the move to the 15-member Security Council in a report last month. The council unanimously adopted a resolution on Thursday that could also cut police by more than a quarter. Conflict in Darfur began in 2003 when mainly non-Arab tribes took up arms against Sudan's Arab-led government. A joint AU/U.N. peacekeeping operation, known as UNAMID, has been on the ground for the past decade. The United Nations says up to 300,000 people have been killed and millions displaced during the conflict.  Under the U.N. resolution adopted on Thursday, the troop ceiling will be cut to 11,395 from 15,485 in the first six months and the maximum police level would be reduced to 2,888 from 3,403. The council also asked Guterres and the AU to submit an assessment by Jan. 1, 2018. That report would review implementation of the drawdown and impact on protection of civilians and access to aid, cooperation of the Sudanese government with the mission and  whether conditions on the ground remain conducive to further reductions.   Unless the Security Council decides otherwise, the peacekeeping mission would then cut its number further during the first half of 2018 to 8,735 troops and 2,500 police.  The council said there was a  need to keep the situation in all areas of Darfur under review  and that the  reconfiguration of UNAMID has to be effectively mitigated by an improved ability to respond to threats quickly and adequately.  The drawdown comes as the United States presses the United Nations to cut costs and become more efficient. U.N. states struck a deal on Wednesday on a $7.3 billion annual peacekeeping budget, diplomats said, cutting $600 million from current costs. In January, the United States gave Sudan 180 days to improve its human rights record and resolve its political and military conflicts before Washington lifts some major unilateral economic sanctions. The United States first imposed sanctions on Sudan in 1997, including a trade embargo and blocking the government's assets, for human rights violations and terrorism concerns. It layered on more sanctions in 2006 for what it said was complicity in the violence in Darfur.

Trump,Steve Mnuchin,USA,BUDGET/ (UPDATE 1),Americas,United States","sector":"","content":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Congress will need to raise the nation's debt limit by early to mid-October to avoid defaulting on loan payments, the Congressional Budget Office said in a report on Thursday. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin has suggested his agency could hit the debt ceiling in September, and has encouraged Congress to raise the limit before the lawmakers go on their August recess. Republican leaders in Congress have begun having bipartisan discussions on the matter in the House. The U.S. government has a statutory limit on how much money it can borrow to cover the budget deficit that results from Washington spending more than it collects in taxes. Only Congress can raise that limit. The updated deadline will do little to diminish the urgency in Congress to act on the debt ceiling. Lawmakers will be still be pressured to tackle the increase before September, when funding the government will become their primary focus. The CBO report pointed to slower-than-expected tax receipts this year, a factor that Mnuchin has cited as a reason to raise the debt ceiling sooner. Lower tax payments were cited also as a factor in an increase in the deficit estimate. The CBO increased the deficit estimate for the current fiscal year to $693 billion, a $134 billion increase from its January estimate. The report factors in only current law that has been approved by Congress, and does not include proposals that have been made by President Donald Trump in his budget proposal released earlier this year. Congress continues to struggle with completing its hefty to-do list. In addition to raising the debt ceiling, Congress must pass a government spending bill before the end of September or face a government shutdown in October. This aligns the deadlines for the debt limit and the spending bill, creating the potential for them to become intertwined. Congressional leaders have expressed a desire to see the two kept separate to avoid getting the debt ceiling increase caught up in the politics of government spending. Congress also is trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act healthcare law and to overhaul the tax code – two efforts that have stalled and consumed more time than was initially expected. And there still are forces pushing against the effort to find agreement on the debt ceiling, including some Republicans who say an increase in the limit should accompany a cut in spending. And there are Democrats who have warned they will not contribute votes to legislation increasing the level if tax cuts for the rich add to the deficit.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-budget-idUSL1N1JQ1SW"},

They didn't see the police operation that killed seven drug suspects that night. But they witnessed the gory aftermath and it haunts them still. That night, Herlina Alim said she watched police haul away the men's bodies, leaving trails of blood.  They were dragged down the alley like pigs,  she said. Her neighbor Lenlen Magano said she saw three bodies, face down and motionless, piled at the end of the alley while police stood calmly by. It was at least an hour, according to residents, before the victims were thrown into a truck and taken to hospital in what a police report said was a bid to save their lives. Old Balara's chief, the elected head of the district, told Reuters he was perplexed. They were already dead, Allan Franza said, so why take them to hospital? An analysis of crime data from two of Metro Manila's five police districts and interviews with doctors, law enforcement officials and victims' families point to one answer: Police were sending corpses to hospitals to destroy evidence at crime scenes and hide the fact that they were executing drug suspects. Thousands of people have been killed since President Rodrigo Duterte took office on June 30 last year and declared war on what he called  the drug menace.  Among them were the seven victims from Old Balara who were declared dead on arrival at hospital. A Reuters analysis of police reports covering the first eight months of the drug war reveals hundreds of cases like those in Old Balara. In Quezon City Police District and neighboring Manila Police District, 301 victims were taken to hospital after police drug operations. Only two survived. The rest were dead on arrival. The data also shows a sharp increase in the number of drug suspects declared dead on arrival in these two districts each month. There were 10 cases at the start of the drug war in July 2016, representing 13 percent of police drug shooting deaths. By January 2017, the tally had risen to 51 cases or 85 percent. The totals grew along with international and domestic condemnation of Duterte's campaign. This increase was no coincidence, said a police commander in Manila, who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity. In late 2016, he said, police began sending victims to hospitals to avoid crime scene investigations and media attention that might show they were executing drug suspects. A Reuters investigation last year found that when police opened fire in drug operations, they killed 97 percent of people they shot. The Manila commander said police depended on emergency room doctors being too focused on the patients to care about why they were shot. The doctors  aren't asking any questions. They only record it: DOA,  he said. But five doctors told Reuters they were troubled by the rising number of police-related DOAs. Four said many drug suspects brought to hospital had been shot in the head and heart, sometimes at close range – precise and unsurvivable wounds that undermined police claims that suspects were injured during chaotic exchanges of gunfire. Oscar Albayalde, Metro Manila's police chief, said he had never heard of officers taking dead suspects to hospital to cover up crime scenes.  We will have that investigated,  he told Reuters. If that investigation showed police were  intentionally moving these dead bodies and bringing them to the hospitals just to alter the evidence, then I think we have to make them explain.  Duterte's office declined to expand on Albayalde's response to Reuters' questions. According to police reports about the incidents, suspects shot during operations were  immediately rushed  to hospital.  The most important (thing) is the life of the person,  said Randy Llanderal, a precinct commander in Quezon City. The police reports reviewed by Reuters showed Llanderal had led or joined operations in which 13 drug suspects ended up dead on arrival. Llanderal said all suspects were shot in self-defense during legitimate operations. The Manila police commander, a retired senior officer and some doctors believe there is a cover up. Hospitalizing drug suspects who have been shot allows police to project a more caring image, said the Manila commander. The retired officer agreed.  It is basically a ploy to make the public believe that the police are mindful of the safety and survival of suspects,  he said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The Manila commander said his officers were instructed to shoot at  sensitive areas.  Suspects who survived were shot again to finish them off or smothered with their own clothing, he said. A Reuters examination of the Old Balara incident and similar operations also suggests that the purpose of hospital runs was to destroy evidence rather than save lives. Police manhandled gunshot victims and showed no urgency in getting them medical treatment, said three sets of family members and other witnesses. Removing bodies makes it harder to work out what really happened.  You obliterate the crime scene – the evidence,  said Rizaldy Rivera, an agent at the Philippines' National Bureau of Investigation who has investigated allegations of police brutality. Police forensic investigators at the scene, said Rivera, must carry out their work on what is effectively a  tampered crime scene.  Scene of Crime Operatives, or SOCO units as police forensic teams are called, process crime scenes and conduct autopsies. Aurelio Trampe, the police general who oversees SOCO, said police officers haven't been removing bodies to alter crime scenes. He said they have the discretion to disregard crime-scene investigative procedures  just as long as they could save lives.  SOCO can still collect evidence from bodies once they reach the hospital, but doesn't always do so. Instead, said SOCO forensic chief Reynaldo Calaoa, that task falls to a police investigator assigned to the case. That investigator often hails from the same station as the colleagues who killed the suspect. Such practices can leave the system open to abuse, said Raquel Del Rosario Fortun, an independent forensic scientist and chair of the University of the Philippines Manila pathology department.  They do the shooting, they do the killing - and they investigate themselves,  she said.  Impunity, that's what's happening.  Cold to the Touch Old Balara is part of Quezon City, the largest of the 17 cities and municipalities that make up Metro Manila, and the most populous city in the Philippines. Old Balara district chief Franza said police insisted his staff of volunteer security guards bring drug-war casualties from operations to the hospital – even when it was clear they were dead. Because he has assisted the police by transporting casualties, the victims' families have accused him and his staff of complicity in the killings, he said. In March, Franza decided he had enough. Keep responding to police calls, he told his staff, but don't take a body to hospital without the go-ahead from SOCO crime scene investigators.  I decided not to take action which I think is not proper,  said Franza. The seven victims from Old Balara arrived at East Avenue Medical Center stacked in a flatbed truck and another vehicle, said Jerome Paez, an attending physician at the emergency room that night. Most had been shot in the head and many also had multiple gunshots in their chests, he said. None were breathing or had a pulse.  All of them were cold to the touch,  said Paez, who has dealt with 21 drug suspects pronounced dead on arrival. The victims had been refused admission earlier at Quezon City General Hospital's emergency room, a 15-minute drive away, because they were already dead, said district chief Franza. The hospital told Reuters it had no record of receiving patients from Old Balara that night. The Old Balara bodies were already in the morgue of East Avenue Medical Center by the time the mother of victim Elmer Gayoso arrived. She asked Reuters to withhold her name, saying she feared retribution from the police. Gayoso had been shot through the head and the heart, she said, and the headshot had destroyed his face. She said her husband identified him by scouring his corpse for familiar childhood scars. The wounds were so grave that she didn't believe that the police took Gayoso to the hospital to save his life.  That was their pretense,  she said, weeping. FILE PHOTO: Men are handcuffed after they were detained by police during a police anti-illegal drugs operation in Quezon city, Metro Manila, Philippines November 9, 2016.Czar Dancel/File PhotoThe killings also troubled Paez, the ER doctor.  We documented everything, just in case in the future it is needed for investigation,  he said. Even if doctors at East Avenue Medical Center suspect a new arrival is dead, hospital protocol requires them to try to resuscitate the patient, said Paez. This is costly and wastes time at a big public hospital teeming with patients. In a recent visit by Reuters, old people wearing oxygen masks lay unmoving on gurneys. New patients arrived every few minutes. Asked about the number of drug suspects arriving dead at hospital, the acting director of the East Avenue Medical Center, Victoria Abesamis, said:  I cannot categorically say that the police are bringing these dead bodies because they want to cover up. I think I will give them the benefit of the doubt.  Trained Shooter Lawrence Bello and three other doctors at East Avenue Medical Center interviewed by Reuters also expressed unease about handling dead-on-arrival cases from police operations. Bello said the police would sometimes deliver bodies that were already displaying rigor mortis, which sets in several hours after death. East Avenue would get two or three such bodies per month, he said. Bello has dealt with 20 cases where suspects were dead on arrival following a police operation, according to Quezon City Police District data. One of them, Bello said, had a single gunshot wound. The bullet had entered below the chin and exited through the top of the head. Bello said he found the injury  quite questionable.  Such an injury is usually associated with victims of suicide or execution, said Homer Venters of Physicians for Human Rights, a group based in New York that investigates mass atrocities.  It is very hard for that to happen when a person isn't fully compliant,  he said. Venters didn't examine the body that Bello referred to. Patel Mayuga, another ER doctor at East Avenue Medical Center, has pronounced 10 victims of police shootings dead on arrival, according to Quezon City Police District data. Suspects who are dead on arrival usually have  clean shots  in the forehead or chest, suggesting the killings were intentional, said Mayuga.  If they are shot in the chest or head, there was time for the attacker to prepare,  he said. Many other drug suspects brought to hospitals in Quezon City by police were also shot in the head and heart, often from less than a meter away, four doctors told Reuters. One January evening, police delivered five bodies in a small jeepney bus to the state-run Novaliches District Hospital in Quezon City. The floor of the jeepney bus was puddled with the victims' blood and excrement, recalled Lawrence Laguno, the ER doctor on duty. According to police, the victims had all pulled guns and opened fire on undercover officers during an anti-drug operation. They missed, and the police returned fire. Slideshow (11 Images) All suspects were seriously injured,  said the police report.  Thereafter, wounded suspects were rushed to Novaliches District Hospital for medical treatment but pronounced dead on arrival by attending physician, Dr. Lawrence Laguno.  Laguno told Reuters that all five men had been shot in the head and chest, with almost the same entry and exit wounds – injuries that looked to him both deliberate and impossible to survive.  It's unusual to have the same five patients with almost the same injuries,  said the doctor.  It was a trained shooter. They knew what they were doing.  Venters of Physicians for Human Rights said it is  incredibly rare  to sustain a tight grouping of gunshot wounds in a shootout. Venters, a medical doctor, has overseen research and investigations into extrajudicial killings. When bullets enter a body from the same direction and plane, it shows the target wasn't moving, he said.  Either they were surprised and shot, or they were subdued and shot.  Willie Saludares, acting chairman of the emergency room at East Avenue Medical Center, said doctors didn't follow up on questionable cases, since how patients were killed wasn't their concern.  I'm sorry to sound too cold, but that's the way it is,  he said.  I am only concerned about the health of the patient. I'm not doing investigative work.  Nor, it seemed, were others. Saludares said that state agencies that investigate police killings, such as the Commission on Human Rights or the National Bureau of Investigation, didn't come to interview him. Saludares also said he was uncomfortable speaking freely and feared losing his job. Chito Gascon, chairman of the Commission on Human Rights, said that if specific cases were brought to the agency's attention, its investigators should pursue them and secure testimony from doctors. But the Commission was stretched, he added.  The CHR, given its current capacity constraints, is only able to investigate and document a fraction of all the deaths that have been reported by the media,  he said. The National Bureau of Investigation didn't comment.  They Weren't Breathing  Police say they don't shoot to kill and that saving lives is paramount. But 17 witnesses interviewed by Reuters say their behavior at crime scenes suggests the opposite. In September, in a district called Nagkaisang Nayon, precinct commander Llanderal led an operation that added six dead-on-arrival cases to the Quezon City body count. According to a police report, the suspects - five men and a woman - opened fire on undercover officers posing as drug buyers. They missed, and the officers returned fire.  When the smoke cleared,  said the report,  all suspects sustained gunshot wounds on their body. Immediately thereafter, all suspects were rushed to Novaliches District Hospital for medical treatment but (were) pronounced dead on arrival.  None of the officers were injured. Llanderal acknowledged that removing the bodies disturbed the crime scene, but insisted the suspects were alive.  They were still moving. All of them!  he said. Bereaved relatives and other witnesses told Reuters the bodies were taken to hospital an hour or more after the shooting, and that none of the victims showed signs of life.  They weren't moving. They weren't breathing,  said Feliciano Dela Cruz, the local district chief.  It's not possible they were alive,  said Jocelyn Ceron, 47, whose husband, Ronaldo, was among the dead.  We saw them thrown in the back of a truck.  Ceron said Ronaldo's body had six bullet wounds: three in the chest or torso, one in the leg, and one in each hand. Relatives said the other bodies each bore at least six gunshot wounds. Ceron showed Reuters photos of the crime scene. Llanderal confirmed that the photos were taken by police investigators and showed the immediate aftermath of his operation. One photo shows a woman lying face down in a blood-smeared alleyway. Others show a tiny room in which five men lie slumped in pools of blood or on the floor; two guns are clearly visible. Reuters shared the crime scene photos with Fortun, the independent forensic scientist.  Based on the pictures, they are apparently very dead,  Fortun said of the six victims. For so many bodies to be crammed into a tiny room  doesn't seem consistent  with police claims that the suspects were shot while fleeing during a gun battle, she added. Relatives of Ronaldo Ceron believe the police executed him and others in cold blood. A neighbor called Maricol Amacna said she heard one of the men begging,  Don't kill me, sir!  The Commission on Human Rights says it is investigating the killings. The police have dismissed allegations of wrongdoing as  useless and baseless,  and have issued commendations to Llanderal and his men for  the extraordinary courage you have displayed in the successful operation...which resulted in the neutralization  of the suspects. Llanderal denied executing drug suspects.  In police operations, we don't know where the bullets may hit,  he said.  Some suspects retaliate, fight us. We are only defending ourselves.

The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) said it had a tripartite agreement with local energy firm First Exploration and Petroleum Development Company and international oil services company Schlumberger to develop the Anyala and Madu fields under Oil Mining Licence (OML) 83 and 85.  The OPEC member state has been seeking investment to increase its crude oil reserves to 40 billion barrels by the year 2020, up from the current proven reserves of 37.2 billion barrels.   NNPC, in an emailed statement, said under the agreement Schlumberger would provide the $700 million investment in developing the fields, which would add 193 million barrels of crude to current reserves. The state oil company said it would also add 800 billion cubic feet of gas to Nigeria's proven gas reserves. Nigeria has the world's ninth largest gas reserves, at 187 trillion cubic feet (tcf).  In terms of daily production, the fields will yield 50,000 barrels of crude oil per day and 120 million standard cubic feet of gas per day by early 2019,  NNPC spokesman Ndu Ughamadu said in the statement.   The state oil company said OMLs 83 and 85 were located in shallow waters 40 km (25 miles) offshore.

U.S. crude futures CLc1 settled up 19 cents at $44.93 a barrel after hitting a two-week high of $45.45 in late-morning trading. The market retreated from highs after Societe Generale became the third investment bank to cut its outlook for oil prices in the last week. Crude prices hit a 10-month low last week but have rebounded more than 5 percent, stretching their bull run to the longest since April. Brent crude futures LCOc1 ended up 11 cents at $47.42 a barrel, after touching a two-week high of $48.03 earlier in the session.  After the steep drop in oil prices of recent weeks, I believe that especially hedge funds saw nice buying momentum and lower U.S. crude production was the trigger to act,  said Hans van Cleef, senior energy economist at ABN Amro. Analysts were not sure whether bearish sentiment had abated in the oil market, given larger-than-usual inventories in the United States for both crude oil and key products like gasoline.  It does feel as if a wave of selling has ebbed for now,  wrote analysts at Credit Suisse. They added, however, that the rebound in prices reflected technical buying rather than a change in fundamentals.     In recent weeks, funds have been unloading long speculative positions, reducing bets on higher prices while brokerages including Goldman Sachs and Societe Generale have cut their 2017 forecasts for crude prices. SocGen on Thursday estimated U.S. crude futures would average $47.50 a barrel in the third quarter, down from previous expectations for $55. U.S. crude production dropped 100,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 9.3 million bpd last week, the steepest weekly fall since July 2016. But analysts said the decline was related to temporary factors, including production shut as a precaution in the Gulf of Mexico due to Tropical Storm Cindy, along with maintenance in Alaska. Global oil supplies remain ample despite output cuts of 1.8 million bpd by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers since January.  OPEC and its allies, trying to reduce a crude glut, agreed in May to extend the supply cut through March 2018. OPEC has exempted Nigeria and Libya from the curbs, leaving them free to ramp up output that had been sapped by local unrest.  That's going to increase pressure on OPEC cuts,  said Tony Scott, managing director of analytics at BTU Analytics in Denver.

It's something that is achievable in the coming months,  Niel said in an interview with Reuters on the site, dubbed Station F, which plans to house 1,000 start-ups under its 1920s glass arcades.  We're of course helped by Brexit,  he added. Paris and Berlin are vying to displace London's lead in the European start-up scene, while other cities including Dublin, Amsterdam and Frankfurt are also promoting themselves as alternative tech hubs in the face of uncertainties caused by the British vote to leave the European Union. Station F's 34,000 square meter (366,000 sq ft) site in Paris makes it the world's biggest startup incubator.  It will shelter early stage companies, venture capital funds, a post office, a round-the-clock restaurant, a tax center and will offer 26 programs to help out entrepreneurs, Niel said. It will also have 3-D printing labs and bars.  U.S. giants Facebook (FB.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O) and South Korea's Naver (035420.KS) partnered with the project, as well as French bank BNP Paribas (BNPP.PA), defense company Thales (TCFP.PA) and French online retailer vente-privée.com. France's President Emmanuel Macron and his wife Brigitte speak with French entrepreneur and businessman Xavier Niel (R) during the inauguration of start-ups incubator  Station F , in Paris, France, June 29, 2017 .Bertrand Guay/PoolFrance's startup scene has been gaining traction lately thanks to booming investments and high expectations for a business-friendly government under new President Emmanuel Macron, who has said he wants to transform France into a  start-up  nation, via a mix of business-friendly reforms and the launch of a 10 billion euro ($11.4 billion) dedicated fund.  We have an environment that serves us well because foreign leaders are either old or they do not make young people dream,  Niel said. Thirty-nine-year old Macron is the youngest leader in France's modern history.  Slideshow (2 Images)The French president was guest of honor at a formal opening ceremony for the center on Thursday.  This word 'entrepreneur' ...is a French word, very French, which the Anglo-Saxons stole from us,  Macron said jokingly to a laughing audience at Station F on Thursday.  Niel, a telecoms maverick who transformed France's mobile sector via the company he founded, Iliad (ILD.PA), wholly funded Station F, investing 250 million euros in the project.     Venture capitalists invested in 590 French startups in 2016, putting the country ahead of Britain (520 deals) and Germany (380), according to research firm Tech.eu. It was a record year with a total of 874 million euros invested in venture capital in France, up 15 percent from 2015, according to the industry lobby Afic. This remains below Germany, with investments of 937 million.

The euro jetted to $1.1444 EUR=, its highest since May 11, 2016, with European Central Bank sources' attempt on Wednesday to moderate the message from Tuesday's speech by President Mario Draghi falling largely on deaf ears. The speech convinced markets that the central bank was preparing to start withdrawing its own emergency stimulus for the euro zone economy later this year. Meanwhile, comments from Bank of England Governor Mark Carney and two top Bank of Canada policymakers on Wednesday ramped up expectations for interest rate increases from those central banks.  The shifting monetary policy trajectories of other central banks is making other currencies more attractive relative to the U.S. dollar,  said Kathy Lien, managing director at BK Asset Management in New York. The euro was last 0.5 percent higher against the dollar at $1.1437. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was down 0.4 percent at 95.597. The index hit a roughly nine-month low of 95.531 in afternoon U.S. trading after the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) forecasts for real U.S. gross domestic product growth in 2017 and 2018 came in slightly lower than the January estimate. Analysts also said lingering doubts among traders that the Fed would be able to raise interest rates again this year hurt the dollar, which is expected to benefit from such increases.   The market is a little sceptical about the Fed outlook for another rate hike this year,  said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington.  Esiner said that scepticism, combined with the more hawkish signals from other central banks, hurt the dollar because it disrupted expectations held since mid-2014 that the Fed would become less accommodative before several other central banks.  The greenback touched a roughly five-month low of C$1.2987 against the Canadian dollar and last traded down 0.3 percent at $1.3001. The dollar hit a more than one-month high of 112.92 yen before easing from that level to last trade 0.2 percent lower against the Japanese currency at 112.05.

ANZ, Australia's third-biggest lender, filed papers on June 6 asking the U.S. District Court in San Francisco to allow it to interview U.S. witnesses about a fraud that involved fake ownership documents for nickel stored in Asian warehouses owned by commodities group Glencore (GLEN.L).   ANZ and Glencore declined to comment.  As part of a complex series of financial transactions, ANZ ended up with ownership documents for nickel stored in Singapore and South Korea, but discovered they were fraudulent when it tried to sell the metal, the court papers said. ANZ has not yet filed a lawsuit, but the bank told the U.S. court it planned to do so in Asia once it discovered who was behind the fraud. ANZ  has every intention of pursuing causes of action against... fraudsters, once their identities are known , the papers said. This is the second legal action that has emerged following the announcement in January by Glencore's metals warehouse firm Access World that it became aware of fake warehouse receipts circulating in its name.      Earlier this month, a court filing in London's High Court showed French bank Natixis (CNAT.PA) had sued metals broker Marex Spectron for $32 million that Natixis said it lost due to fake warehouse receipts for metal stored at Access World depots.  Marex had said in a statement it rejected the claim and issued a separate claim against Access World for an unspecified amount because it said the warehouse operator had verified the receipts as being authentic. Natixis and Access World had declined to comment. Nickel Worth $306 Mln The fraud was uncovered following repurchase transactions between ANZ and two Hong Kong firms involving 84 warehouse receipts for nickel of which 83 turned out to be fake, the court papers filed by ANZ said.   ANZ's court filing included copies of the purchase contracts, showing the transactions involved 32,964 tonnes of nickel, which at current benchmark prices CMNI3 would be worth about $306.4 million. The deals were arranged by broker ED&F; Man, which was not involved in the fraud and was cooperating to identify those responsible, ANZ added in the legal documents. “ED&F; is not involved in this legal action and has no further comment to make,” the broker said in an emailed statement. ANZ said in the U.S. court papers that it had already unearthed information in Hong Kong after it asked courts there for access to bank records. For example, those bank documents, included in the U.S. court filing, showed transfers of $151 million from the two Hong Kong firms involved in the nickel trades to people and entities in California. ANZ told the U.S. court it wanted to interview those parties in California that received the funds.

It's something that is achievable in the coming months,  Niel said in an interview with Reuters on the site, dubbed Station F, which plans to house 1,000 start-ups under its 1920s glass arcades.  We're of course helped by Brexit,  he added. Paris and Berlin are vying to displace London's lead in the European start-up scene, while other cities including Dublin, Amsterdam and Frankfurt are also promoting themselves as alternative tech hubs in the face of uncertainties caused by the British vote to leave the European Union. Station F's 34,000 square meter (366,000 sq ft) site in Paris makes it the world's biggest startup incubator.  It will shelter early stage companies, venture capital funds, a post office, a round-the-clock restaurant, a tax center and will offer 26 programs to help out entrepreneurs, Niel said. It will also have 3-D printing labs and bars.  U.S. giants Facebook (FB.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O) and South Korea's Naver (035420.KS) partnered with the project, as well as French bank BNP Paribas (BNPP.PA), defense company Thales (TCFP.PA) and French online retailer vente-privée.com.

We have an environment that serves us well because foreign leaders are either old or they do not make young people dream,  Niel said. Thirty-nine-year old Macron is the youngest leader in France's modern history.  Slideshow (2 Images)The French president was guest of honor at a formal opening ceremony for the center on Thursday.  This word 'entrepreneur' ...is a French word, very French, which the Anglo-Saxons stole from us,  Macron said jokingly to a laughing audience at Station F on Thursday.  Niel, a telecoms maverick who transformed France's mobile sector via the company he founded, Iliad (ILD.PA), wholly funded Station F, investing 250 million euros in the project.     Venture capitalists invested in 590 French startups in 2016, putting the country ahead of Britain (520 deals) and Germany (380), according to research firm Tech.eu. It was a record year with a total of 874 million euros invested in venture capital in France, up 15 percent from 2015, according to the industry lobby Afic. This remains below Germany, with investments of 937 million.

Unlike in other parts of the United Kingdom, abortion is banned in Northern Ireland unless the life or mental health of the mother is in danger. Women can be jailed for life, as can doctors who perform abortions. In a landmark ruling in 2015, Belfast's High Court found that the laws breached the European Convention on Human Rights by failing to provide exceptions in cases of fatal foetal abnormality or sexual crime. Belfast's Court of Appeal quashed that ruling on Thursday following a challenge by Northern Ireland's justice department and attorney general, concluding that abortion legislation should be a matter for Northern Ireland's provincial assembly. The board of the non-governmental Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission (NIRHC), which brought the original case, said they plan to lodge an appeal to the British Supreme Court in London.  We first raised this issue in 2013 and remain as concerned today in 2017 that the law as it stands does not protect women and girls right to be free from torture and inhuman and degrading treatment,  NIRHC Chief Commissioner Les Allamby said in a statement. Earlier this month, the Supreme Court narrowly upheld a ban on Britain's National Health Service funding abortion care in England for women from Northern Ireland, out of  respect  for the decisions of the region's assembly. That prompted Britain's opposition Labour Party to propose an amendment to Prime Minister Theresa May's new legislative programme, calling for women from Northern Ireland to have access to free abortions in England. Just as in the Republic of Ireland, where the law is equally strict, thousands of women travel to Britain from Northern Ireland every year for abortions. To avoid a potential defeat on the amendment, which had support among May's Conservative lawmakers, finance minister Philip Hammond said London would  fund abortions in England for women arriving here from Northern Ireland . The leader of Northern Ireland's Alliance Party described the move a  helpful measure  but not a solution, as women would still have to travel and face financial costs while Northern Ireland continued to  export  the issue.  We have got to find a solution which is respectful of the sensitivities of our society but at the same time respectful of the fact that women have to be given some degree of control over their own fertility rights,  Naomi Long told reporters.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/nireland-abortion-idUSL1N1JQ1RH"},

Iraqi authorities expect the long battle for Mosul to end in coming days as remaining Islamic State fighters are bottled up in just a handful of neighborhoods of the Old City. The seizure of the nearly 850-year-old Grand al-Nuri Mosque -- from where Islamic State proclaimed the caliphate nearly three years ago to the day -- is a huge symbolic victory.  The return of al-Nuri Mosque and al-Hadba minaret to the fold of the nation marks the end of the Daesh state of falsehood,  Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said in a statement, referring to the hardline Sunni Mulsim group by an Arabic acronym. The fall of Mosul would in effect mark the end of the Iraqi half of the IS caliphate, although the group still controls territory west and south of the city, ruling over hundreds of thousands of people.  Its stronghold in Syria, Raqqa, is also close to falling. A U.S.-backed Kurdish-led coalition besieging Raqqa on Thursday fully encircled it after closing the militants' last way out from the south, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group said. These setbacks have reduced Islamic State's territory by 60 percent from its peak two years ago and its revenue by 80 percent, to just $16 million a month, said IHS Markit.   Their fictitious state has fallen,  an Iraqi military spokesman, Brigadier General Yahya Rasool, told state TV. However, it still occupies an area as big as Belgium, across Iraq and Syria, according to IHS Markit, an analytics firm.   Islamic State fighters blew up the medieval mosque and its famed leaning minaret a week ago as U.S.-backed Iraqi forces started a push in its direction. Their black flag had been flying from al-Hadba (The Hunchback) minaret since June 2014. Related CoverageIraqi PM declares 'the end of the Daesh state of falsehood' after capture of Mosul mosqueMuch of the mosque and brickwork minaret was reduced to rubble, said a Reuters TV reporter who went to the site with the elite units that captured it. Only the stump of the Hunchback remained, and a green dome of the mosque supported by a few pillars which resisted the blast, he said. The mosque grounds were off limits as the insurgents are suspected to have planted booby traps.  Abadi  issued instructions to bring the battle to its conclusion,  by capturing the remaining parts of the Old City, his office said. The cost of the fighting has been enormous. In addition to military casualties, thousands of civilians are estimated to have been killed. About 900,000 people, nearly half the pre-war population of the northern city, have fled, mostly taking refuge in camps or with relatives and friends, according to aid groups. Members of Iraqi Counter Terrorism Service sift through the ruins of the Grand al-Nuri Mosque at the Old City in Mosul, Iraq June 29, 2017.Erik De CastroThose trapped in the city suffered hunger, deprivation and IS oppression as well as death or injury, and many buildings have been ruined. Arduous Task Counter Terrorism Service (CTS) troops captured the al-Nuri Mosque's ground in a  lightning operation  on Thursday, a commander of the U.S.-trained elite units told state TV.  CTS units are now in control of the mosque area and the al-Hadba and Sirjkhana neighborhoods and they are still advancing, a military statement said. Other government units, from the army and police, were closing in from other directions.  An elite Interior Ministry unit said it freed about 20 children believed to belong to Yazidi and other minorities persecuted by the jihadists in a quarter north of the Old City which houses Mosul's main hospitals.  Slideshow (12 Images)A U.S.-led international coalition is providing air and ground support to the Iraqi forces fighting through the Old City's maze of narrow alleyways.     But the advance remains arduous as IS fighters are dug in the middle of civilians, using mortar fire, snipers, booby traps and suicide bombers to defend their last redoubt. The military estimated up to 350 militants were still in the Old City last week but many have been killed since.  They are besieged in one sq km (0.4 square mile) making up less than 40 percent of the Old City and less than one percent of the total area of Mosul, the largest urban center over which they held sway in both Iraq and Syria. Those residents who have escaped the Old City say many of the civilians trapped behind IS lines -- put last week at 50,000 by the Iraqi military -- are in a desperate situation with little food, water or medicines.  Boys and girls who have managed to escape show signs of moderate malnutrition and carry psychosocial scars,  the United Nations Children's Fund UNICEF said in a statement. Thousands of children remain at risk in Mosul, it said. IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi proclaimed himself ruler of all Muslims from the Grand al-Nuri Mosque's pulpit on July 4, 2014, after the insurgents overran swathes of Iraq and Syria. His speech from the mosque was the first time he revealed himself to the world and the footage broadcast then is to this day the only video recording of him as  caliph . He has left the fighting in Mosul to local commanders and is believed to be hiding in the border area between Iraq and Syria, according to U.S. and Iraqi military sources. The mosque was named after Nuruddin al‑Zanki, a noble who fought the early Crusaders from a fiefdom that covered territory in modern-day Turkey, Syria and Iraq. It was built in 1172-73, shortly before his death, and housed an Islamic school. The Old City's stone buildings date mostly from the medieval period. They include market stalls, a few mosques and churches, and small houses built and rebuilt on top of each other over the ages. Additional reporting by Stephen Kalin in Erbil.

ANZ, Australia's third-biggest lender, filed papers on June 6 asking the U.S. District Court in San Francisco to allow it to interview U.S. witnesses about a fraud that involved fake ownership documents for nickel stored in Asian warehouses owned by commodities group Glencore (GLEN.L).   ANZ and Glencore declined to comment.  As part of a complex series of financial transactions, ANZ ended up with ownership documents for nickel stored in Singapore and South Korea, but discovered they were fraudulent when it tried to sell the metal, the court papers said. ANZ has not yet filed a lawsuit, but the bank told the U.S. court it planned to do so in Asia once it discovered who was behind the fraud. ANZ  has every intention of pursuing causes of action against... fraudsters, once their identities are known , the papers said. This is the second legal action that has emerged following the announcement in January by Glencore's metals warehouse firm Access World that it became aware of fake warehouse receipts circulating in its name.      Earlier this month, a court filing in London's High Court showed French bank Natixis (CNAT.PA) had sued metals broker Marex Spectron for $32 million that Natixis said it lost due to fake warehouse receipts for metal stored at Access World depots.  Marex had said in a statement it rejected the claim and issued a separate claim against Access World for an unspecified amount because it said the warehouse operator had verified the receipts as being authentic. Natixis and Access World had declined to comment. Nickel Worth $306 Mln The fraud was uncovered following repurchase transactions between ANZ and two Hong Kong firms involving 84 warehouse receipts for nickel of which 83 turned out to be fake, the court papers filed by ANZ said.   ANZ's court filing included copies of the purchase contracts, showing the transactions involved 32,964 tonnes of nickel, which at current benchmark prices CMNI3 would be worth about $306.4 million. The deals were arranged by broker ED&F; Man, which was not involved in the fraud and was cooperating to identify those responsible, ANZ added in the legal documents. “ED&F; is not involved in this legal action and has no further comment to make,” the broker said in an emailed statement. ANZ said in the U.S. court papers that it had already unearthed information in Hong Kong after it asked courts there for access to bank records. For example, those bank documents, included in the U.S. court filing, showed transfers of $151 million from the two Hong Kong firms involved in the nickel trades to people and entities in California. ANZ told the U.S. court it wanted to interview those parties in California that received the funds.

Despite public fatigue, Europe's latest offer for reinforcements underscores the West's determination to defeat Taliban fighters who harbored al Qaeda militants behind the September 2001 attacks on New York and Washington. It also reflects a growing realization that the United States and its allies were too hasty in pulling down their large troop presence in 2011, which allowed militants to regain ground and weaken efforts to build Afghanistan's democracy.  Looking back on it, it's pretty much a consensus that we may have ...reduced the numbers a little too rapidly,  U.S. Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis told a news conference following a meeting of NATO defense ministers. Since drastically drawing down from a peak of more than 130,000 NATO troops in 2011, allies have scrapped an earlier plan to pull out of the country despite the high costs of the United States' longest-running war. In a closed-door meeting, Mattis pressed NATO allies and non-member partners to provide more personnel to help train the Afghan armed forces. That would add to the 13,450 U.S. and multinational troops involved in training in the country.  NATO commanders are working on the basis of around 1,200 additional troops for next year, diplomats said, but Mattis declined to go into numbers. He said so far he filled 70 percent of the gaps identified by NATO and voiced confidence following his talks in Brussels that  we'll be filling the rest.   We still have a few gaps and nations are stepping up,  Mattis said. The United States is considering sending up to 5,000 more troops beyond what NATO allies offer, officials say.

British Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said London would add just under 100 troops, taking its contribution to 585. Spain said it had not made a decision but was ready to help where it could.  We are in it for the long haul, it's a democracy that has asked for our help and it is important that Europe responds,  Fallon said, noting the widening Taliban insurgency across the country and frequent suicide attacks that have hit Kabul.

Marshall Center in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany June 28, 2017.Michaela RehleSome governments declined to offer more, including Canada, which withdrew the last of its troops in 2014. Progress hung on a new U.S. strategy still being devised and which Mattis is expected to present in mid-July to Donald Trump, after the U.S. president sharply criticized U.S. policy in Afghanistan during his election campaign. After almost 40 years of conflict in Afghanistan, NATO's will be the latest effort to break what its Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg called a stalemate, stressing the need for a peace deal involving regional powers. Several attempts in recent years to broker a settlement between the Western-backed government in Kabul and the Taliban, have all failed. Without the militants at the table, experts say it is hard to envisage a meaningful solution. The U.S. Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats has also warned the outlook for the country is bleak even with more NATO and U.S. troops. Mattis did not comment on that intelligence assessment but signaled his long-term support for Afghanistan, declining to say when it might end.  I don't put timelines on wars,  he said, adding the West had learned the consequences of allowing its enemies to plot against it from ungoverned spaces.

Since drastically drawing down from a peak of more than 130,000 NATO troops in 2011, allies have scrapped an earlier plan to pull out of the country despite the high costs of the United States' longest-running war. In a closed-door meeting, Mattis pressed NATO allies and non-member partners to provide more personnel to help train the Afghan armed forces. That would add to the 13,450 U.S. and multinational troops involved in training in the country.  NATO commanders are working on the basis of around 1,200 additional troops for next year, diplomats said, but Mattis declined to go into numbers. He said so far he filled 70 percent of the gaps identified by NATO and voiced confidence following his talks in Brussels that  we'll be filling the rest.   We still have a few gaps and nations are stepping up,  Mattis said. The United States is considering sending up to 5,000 more troops beyond what NATO allies offer, officials say.

Marshall Center in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany June 28, 2017.Michaela Rehle No Timeline  Britain, Norway and Lithuania were among countries to publicly commit to more personnel. British Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said London would add just under 100 troops, taking its contribution to 585. Spain said it had not made a decision but was ready to help where it could.  We are in it for the long haul, it's a democracy that has asked for our help and it is important that Europe responds,  Fallon said, noting the widening Taliban insurgency across the country and frequent suicide attacks that have hit Kabul.

Progress hung on a new U.S. strategy still being devised and which Mattis is expected to present in mid-July to Donald Trump, after the U.S. president sharply criticized U.S. policy in Afghanistan during his election campaign. After almost 40 years of conflict in Afghanistan, NATO's will be the latest effort to break what its Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg called a stalemate, stressing the need for a peace deal involving regional powers. Several attempts in recent years to broker a settlement between the Western-backed government in Kabul and the Taliban, have all failed. Without the militants at the table, experts say it is hard to envisage a meaningful solution. The U.S. Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats has also warned the outlook for the country is bleak even with more NATO and U.S. troops. Mattis did not comment on that intelligence assessment but signaled his long-term support for Afghanistan, declining to say when it might end.  I don't put timelines on wars,  he said, adding the West had learned the consequences of allowing its enemies to plot against it from ungoverned spaces.

Blue Apron's IPO, the first for a U.S. meal-kit company, was expected to create a buzz around smaller peers, which are either looking to go public or be acquired at rich valuations. However, Amazon's $13.7 billion deal to buy Whole Foods has left potential investors worried about the prospects of the meal-kit industry. Industry insiders say that buying Whole Foods would bolster Amazon's distribution system for food delivery in the form of brick-and-mortar grocery stores. There are also concerns about Blue Apron's lack of profitability and marketing costs. Like other meal-kit companies, Blue Apron has spent heavily on marketing to compete for customers who often switch service providers, or cancel their subscriptions altogether. Blue Apron spent roughly 18 percent of its $795.4 million revenue in 2016 on marketing, posting a net loss of $54.9 million.

If Zscaler succeeds in going public, it would be one of the few venture capital-backed cyber security IPOs in recent years, despite a surge in cyber attacks and hacks. Investors have been wary of the companies' ability to constantly advance their software to stay on top of threats.  Zscaler is expected to hire IPO underwriters in the coming weeks, the sources said this week, asking not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Zscaler declined to comment.  Okta Inc, an identity management company went public in April, the only cyber security IPO so far this year, and is trading above its IPO price. It has a market capitalization of about $2 billion.  Cyber security companies such as Carbon Black, ForeScout and LogRhythm have been exploring IPOs, but have remained on the sidelines. Hundreds of security startups have sprouted in recent years, promising  next-generation  technologies to fight cyber criminals, government spies and hacker activists, who have plagued some of the world's biggest corporations.  Many of the younger companies have struggled to stand out from the crowd and grow revenue on a sustainable basis since sophisticated cyber attacks can make software obsolete very quickly.  While the IPO market has reopened for technology companies this year, some investors expect more  meat-and-potatoes  technology offerings of enterprise software firms with moderate valuations but established business models. Zscaler counts Alphabet's growth equity fund, CapitalG, and private equity firm TPG's growth equity fund as investors. It is seeking a valuation at nearly double its last funding round in 2015. That year, it closed a $110 million funding round and was valued at more than $1 billion, Reuters has reported. San Jose, California-based Zscaler was founded in 2008 by Jay Chaudhry, who is its chief executive officer. It specializes in cloud security and its software is in 100 data centers globally that can scan incoming and outgoing traffic between corporations and the public cloud to identify threats and protect corporate intellectual property. Zscaler hired Remo Canessa as a new chief financial officer in February. He had worked as a CFO at public technology companies.

The dollar index touched its lowest since October - before Donald Trump was elected U.S. president - as investors shifted to the view that the U.S. Federal Reserve might not be the only game in town when it comes to higher interest rates. With the Fed green-lighting dividends and buybacks in major banks as part of another round of stress tests, financial stocks rose but not enough to offset declines in technology and interest-rate sensitive sectors.  Part of the reason why tech is down today is the steam in the recent rotation out of some of big tech winners and into banks,  said Michael Scanlon, portfolio manager at Manulife Asset Management in Boston. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 141.38 points, or 0.66 percent, to 21,313.23, the S&P; 500 lost 19.61 points, or 0.80 percent, to 2,421.08 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 101.99 points, or 1.64 percent, to 6,132.42. European shares logged their biggest one-day loss in nine months on Thursday as interest rate-sensitive sectors were hit by a rising hawkish chorus from central banks globally. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index lost 1.36 percent and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.50 percent. Emerging market stocks lost 0.13 percent. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 0.54 percent higher, while Japan's Nikkei rose 0.45 percent. As euro zone bond yields rallied, the euro surged to as high as $1.1434, its strongest since May 2016. The dollar index fell 0.42 percent, with the euro up 0.51 percent to $1.1434. Bank of England Governor Mark Carney surprised many on Wednesday by conceding a hike was likely to be needed as the economy came closer to running at full capacity. That sent sterling above $1.30 on Thursday for the first time in five weeks, leaving it close to its highest levels in nine months. The pound was last trading at $1.2993, up 0.53 percent on the day. The Bank of Canada had its say, with two top policymakers this week suggesting they might tighten monetary policy as early as July. The Canadian dollar strengthened 0.25 percent versus the greenback at 1.30 per dollar.  The shifting monetary policy trajectories of other central banks is making other currencies more attractive relative to the U.S. dollar,  said Kathy Lien, managing director at BK Asset Management in New York. The Japanese yen strengthened 0.23 percent versus the greenback at 112.07 per dollar. Benchmark U.S. Treasury yields rose to five-week highs in sympathy with higher European government debt yields, as investors evaluated the likelihood of less accommodative policy.  What's going on in Europe is really what's driving us here,  said Brian Daingerfield, a macro strategist at NatWest Markets in Stamford, Connecticut. Treasury 10-year notes last fell 14/32 in price to yield 2.2701 percent, from 2.223 percent late on Wednesday. U.S. oil futures edged up after hitting a two-week high, extending a rally into a sixth straight session after a decline in weekly U.S. crude production temporarily alleviated concerns about deepening oversupply. Brent ticked lower. U.S. crude rose 0.07 percent to $44.77 per barrel and Brent was last at $47.24, down 0.15 percent on the day. Gold fell as central bank comments lifted bond yields. Spot gold dropped 0.3 percent to $1,245.62 an ounce. U.S. gold futures fell 0.26 percent to $1,245.80 an ounce. Copper rose 0.75 percent to $5,925.00 a tonne.

Premium channels like CBS Corp's Showtime have done this for years to entice new subscribers, but cable networks have not, fearing they might cannibalize TV ratings. But today viewers have many more choices as streaming companies like Amazon.com Inc and Netflix Inc bring a year-round slate of new shows on top of broadcast television.  As a result, networks need to do more to promote new shows, according to Dave Morgan, head of advertising technology company Simulmedia. Previously, networks focused all marketing around a show's premier, said Kevin Reilly, chief creative officer at Turner.   Today, the entire first season is a marketing vehicle,  he said. “If I said that five years ago, people would have said 'You're out of your mind'.  Over the past year, Turner put five premiers on Facebook and Google's YouTube. Discovery's true crime channel, Investigation Discovery (ID), plans to put the first episode of at least five of its series on its app for cable subscribers before they air on TV, said Kevin Bennett, general manager of ID. When college football season starts in August, Walt Disney Co's sports network ESPN, which is struggling with declining subscribers, will let online viewers watch 10 minutes of any game or show for free on its app.  If the app recognizes the viewer as a fan of a specific team, it will showcase that team's games, Justin Connolly, executive vice president, affiliate sales and marketing at ESPN, told Reuters. After 10 minutes, they will have to verify they are a cable subscriber or sign up. File Photo: The Discovery Communications headquarters building is seen in Silver Spring, Maryland December 3, 2009.Brad Bower/File PhotoEarly Success? By putting some episodes online for free, Turner faces the added risk of upsetting its cable and satellite partners. Aware of that, Turner has only selected certain shows to put online.  Last June, Turner's TNT got about 6 million viewers for the first episode of its new family crime drama,  Animal Kingdom,  which it streamed on Facebook and YouTube before it aired on TV. Turner said 16 percent of those online viewers - or about 960,000 people - came back to watch the show on TV. Turner believes that putting the premier online helped the show to increase its share of younger viewers, between 18 and 49 years old, from 899,000 at the show's television debut to 1.15 million by the final episode.  Ticker and trading information for media conglomerate Time Warner Inc. is displayed at the post where it is traded on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S., October 21, 2016.Brendan McDermid It might not build Nielsen ratings, but it builds engagement,  said Michael Engleman, executive vice president of entertainment marketing at Turner, referring to the TV industry's leading ratings firm. ID has put the second episodes of some shows on its ID GO app for cable subscribers immediately after the first episodes aired on TV in a bid to drive people to its app and to create a buzz, Bennett said. Last Spring, Discovery streamed the second episode of its miniseries about Casey Anthony, the Florida mom acquitted of killing her two-year-old daughter, right after the first episode aired on TV.  When the episode aired on TV the next night, it was the highest-rated second episode for ID ever on TV, Bennett said.  For Discovery, whether viewers watch its shows on its app or on TV is not a key distinction. Discovery gets a 50-percent premium on ads sold through the app since they are more targeted and viewers cannot skip ads, said Paul Guyardo, chief commercial officer at Discovery. Such tactics can help when Discovery begins negotiations with its pay TV partners, he said.  When we come up for renewals, we aren't just providing a linear channel,  Guyardo said.  That helps with renewals and rate increases.  Reporting by Jessica Toonkel; editing by Anna Driver and Bill Rigby","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/television-internet-idUSL1N1JQ1NC"},

Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin has suggested his agency could hit the debt ceiling in September, and has encouraged Congress to raise the limit before the lawmakers go on their August recess. Republican leaders in Congress have begun having bipartisan discussions on the matter in the House.  The U.S. government has a statutory limit on how much money it can borrow to cover the budget deficit that results from Washington spending more than it collects in taxes. Only Congress can raise that limit.  The updated deadline will do little to diminish the urgency in Congress to act on the debt ceiling. Lawmakers will be still be pressured to tackle the increase before September, when funding the government will become their primary focus. The CBO report pointed to slower-than-expected tax receipts this year, a factor that Mnuchin has cited as a reason to raise the debt ceiling sooner.  Lower tax payments were cited also as a factor in an increase in the deficit estimate. The CBO increased the deficit estimate for the current fiscal year to $693 billion, a $134 billion increase from its January estimate. The report factors in only current law that has been approved by Congress, and does not include proposals that have been made by President Donald Trump in his budget proposal released earlier this year. Congress continues to struggle with completing its hefty to-do list. In addition to raising the debt ceiling, Congress must pass a government spending bill before the end of September or face a government shutdown in October. This aligns the deadlines for the debt limit and the spending bill, creating the potential for them to become intertwined. Congressional leaders have expressed a desire to see the two kept separate to avoid getting the debt ceiling increase caught up in the politics of government spending.  Congress also is trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act healthcare law and to overhaul the tax code – two efforts that have stalled and consumed more time than was initially expected. And there still are forces pushing against the effort to find agreement on the debt ceiling, including some Republicans who say an increase in the limit should accompany a cut in spending.

Using the handle, @BillAckman1, the 51-year-old investor is the latest to join the social media network that rivals like Carl Icahn, @Carl_C_Icahn, have used to unveil investment ideas and comment on news about portfolio companies. A spokesman for Ackman confirmed the account is real. So far, the account looks bare-bones. As of Thursday afternoon, there was no picture of the widely photographed fund manager, nor were there any tweets. But Ackman had already accumulated more than 1,000 followers, including many self-described traders and financial journalists. Among the 46 users he followed were former Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, tennis star Roger Federer and Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein. Ackman also follows President Donald Trump on Twitter, and like Trump himself he has a reputation for saying exactly what is on his mind, sometimes ignoring the social norms of polite conversation. After two years of heavy losses that damaged his reputation as a savvy investor, Ackman has said this year that his investment team is working on new ideas while he also goes back to his basics to beef up performance. His Pershing Square Holdings is now nursing losses of 2.5 percent for the year so far after having had gains earlier in the year.

Rite Aid's shares plunged about 28 percent to $2.85, while Walgreens shares were up 1 percent at $77.97. Walgreens also ended a related deal to sell as many as 1,200 Rite Aid stores to Fred's Inc (FRED.O), sending Fred's shares down 19 percent. Walgreens, the biggest U.S. drugstore chain, will likely have an easier time winning antitrust approval to buy 2,186 Rite Aid stores after it failed to win approval to take over the nearly 4,600-store chain.  Walgreens and Rite Aid have taken a pragmatic approach,  said Neil Saunders, managing director of market research firm GlobalData Retail. The revised deal could offer many of the same benefits as a whole-sale take out of the company, but on a smaller scale. Walgreens said it expects about $400 million of cost savings from its new agreement, down from around $1 billion expected from the original deal.  That could help offset challenges it faced in recent years hitting targets for sales growth, which has been weighed on in part by disappointing growth in its retail segment.  Walgreens also invited Rite Aid to join its group purchasing agreement, which aims to leverage the combined heft of its members to negotiate discounts on generic drug prices.  The decision to sell so many stores will weaken Rite Aid and could still be controversial, said David Balto, an antitrust lawyer who had worked with groups opposing Walgreens’ takeover of Rite Aid.  Rite Aid's future is going to be bleak after they sell these stores. This is still going to raise some serious questions. It's still taking out a major competitor,  Balto said. In fact, Walgreens' plan to buy 2,186 Rite Aid stores accomplishes many of the same goals as the merger - including eliminating Rite Aid as a rival - but does so in a way that makes it harder for the FTC to take the companies to court to stop the transaction, antitrust experts said. A sign marks a Rite Aid pharmacy in Somerville, Massachusetts, U.S., June 29, 2017.Brian Snyder Obviously no victory dance for the FTC today. This was a big stick-it-to-you. They're (the FTC) getting a worse outcome than they would before,  said Andre Barlow of the law firm Doyle, Barlow and Mazard PLLC.  Clearly they (the companies) know what the FTC concerns are. They have likely worked around those issues, which has to be very frustrating for the FTC.  The FTC sued to stop two separate deals last week, suggesting that former administration's tough antitrust approach will continue under President Donald Trump. The agency is being run by Acting Chairwoman Maureen Ohlhausen and three commissioner slots are vacant. The FTC said on Thursday it would review the new proposal. Walgreens to Pay More Per Store Slideshow (5 Images)Rite Aid said the stores to be sold are mainly in the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic and Southeast. The deal also includes distribution centers in Connecticut, Pennsylvania and South Carolina.  Leerink Partners analyst David Larsen estimated that under the new deal, Walgreens would be paying $2.4 million per Rite Aid store, higher than what it would have paid under a previous agreement, where it would have paid $2.04 million to $2.06 million per store.  Walgreens said on Thursday it expects the new deal to close within six months.      Walgreens also reported better-than-expected profit and sales for the third quarter, helped by a rise in prescription volumes in its U.S. pharmacy business.   The company also authorized a $5 billion buyback program and raised the lower end of its full-year profit forecast by 8 cents per share to a range of $4.98 to $5.08. Analysts on average were expecting full-year profit of $4.96 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  The new agreement will assist Rite Aid in addressing pharmacy margin challenges and in significantly reducing debt, the company's CEO John Standley said in a statement.  Walgreens said it would pay Rite Aid a $325 million termination fee. In October 2015, Walgreens said it would buy No. 3 Rite Aid for $9.5 billion.

Finance is not the enemy, unemployment is the enemy,  Le Maire said, referring to former president Francois Hollande who swept to power in 2012 declaring finance his enemy and imposing a now-defunct tax on millionaires.

Most loan and derivative contracts in Europe are written in English law, but Britain's exit from the European Union raises problems about how they would be enforced outside of Britain.  All proceedings will take place in English. We will hire people with experience in common law regardless of where they come from,  Le Maire said. While Macron, a former investment banker, is more relaxed about the use of English than previous French leaders, the move marks a big step for a country that takes deep pride in its language and cherishes its legal system rooted in Roman law.  Long gone are the days when you could only do business or speak to regulators in French. We will always be proud of our language, but we also understand the need to make it easier for financial institutions operating in France,  Le Maire said in a speech delivered in English. Macron's government is keen to convince Wall Street banks to dump London for Paris, hoping to override concerns about its rigid labour laws and high taxes with plans to push through reforms to make doing business easier.  Attracting major U.S. banks to Paris, rather than letting them settle in London, Dublin, Amsterdam or Frankfurt, is about creating jobs in France, bringing wealth to France,  Le Maire said. Prime Minister Edouard Philippe is to announce measures in the coming weeks to boost the attractiveness of Paris as a global financial hub, a government spokesman said on Wednesday. In New York, Le Maire was due to meet executives from banks JPMorgan, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, Lazard , private equity firm KKR, fund giant Blackrock and hedge fund Paulson & Co. Former Bank of France governor Christian Noyer told Reuters this week that banks from London had been quietly securing licences to operate from Paris after Brexit.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/france-britain-court-idUSL1N1JQ1NS"},

The technology sector, which has led the S&P; 500's 8-percent gain for the year, dropped 2.1 percent, and were the worst-performing major group. Declines in big tech stocks, including Apple and Microsoft, weighed the most on the benchmark S&P.; Financials and energy were the only sectors in positive territory as investors may have been rotating into groups that have lagged this year.  U.S. equities have remained extended, at or close to record territory for an extended period of time really without a tremendous amount of conviction in the market,  said Peter Kenny, senior market strategist at Global Markets Advisory Group, in New York.  It’s really been treading water. Without a major stimulus to drive prices higher, equities have to reset and that’s what they’re doing today,  Kenny said. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 167.7 points, or 0.78 percent, to 21,286.91, the S&P; 500 lost 21.67 points, or 0.89 percent, to 2,419.02 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 109.49 points, or 1.76 percent, to 6,124.92. The CBOE Volatility index, the widely followed barometer of expected near-term stock market volatility, rose as high as 15.16, its highest level in six weeks. Equity investors also may be concerned about the rise in interest rates globally, with European stocks also falling. With the second quarter coming to a close, the market has experienced a volatile few days. Just on Wednesday, the tech-heavy Nasdaq had posted its best day since Nov. 7, and tech remains the best-performing sector this year. “Large-cap tech and software are extended on a valuation basis,  Kenny said.  The opposite is the case in financials and in energy.  Financials were the bright spot for the stock market, rising 0.8 percent. Bank stocks gained after the U.S. Federal Reserve approved the banks' plans to raise dividend payouts and share buybacks under its annual stress test program. Wells Fargo shares rose 2.6 percent while Citigroup gained 3.3 percent. Energy rose 0.4 percent. Oil prices edged up after a decline in weekly U.S. crude production temporarily alleviated concerns about deepening oversupply. Investors have been concerned about tepid data about U.S. economic growth as the Fed is raising interest rates from very low levels. Data showed the U.S. economy slowed less sharply in the first quarter than initially estimated due to unexpectedly higher consumer spending and a bigger jump in exports. The Fed can go it alone on monetary policy among global central banks but strong data is needed for that to continue, St. Louis Federal Reserve chief James Bullard said. In corporate news, Rite Aid slumped 29 percent after Walgreens Boots Alliance scrapped its deal to buy Rite Aid after failing to win antitrust approval, but said it would instead buy nearly half of the smaller rival's U.S. stores. Walgreens shares rose 1.2 percent. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 2.95-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.22-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

After antitrust pushback on the full-strength $9.4 billion deal, Walgreens has abandoned it and is instead buying over 2,000 of Rite Aid's stores for $5.2 billion. For Chief Executive Officer Stefano Pessina, doing about half the deal with half the benefits is something – but it's a modest return on at least 20 months' work. The acquisition, announced in October 2015, was always a high-risk, high-return venture. Adding over 4,500 locations would have combined two of the top three pharmacies in America and produced a projected $1 billion of annual savings. Investors initially added $5 billion to Walgreens’ market value. Regulators proved harder to persuade. An initial proposal to divest 865 stores was bumped up to 1,200 in a revised proposal earlier this year. The Federal Trade Commission made it clear, however, that this still wouldn't cut it.  Walgreens is confident the new deal addresses watchdogs' concerns. And Pessina can claim there's still a decent rationale for the acquisition, even though Walgreens has to pay a $325 million break fee to Rite Aid for the old deal on top of the new price. The purchase includes almost half Rite Aid’s stores, and Walgreens reckons there are at least $400 million of annual cost savings to be had. The value of those synergies should cover any premium Pessina is paying. And assuming the stores account for half of Rite Aid’s estimated net operating profit in 2020, it all adds up to a post-tax return on investment above 10 percent. Walgreens stock was flat in Thursday late morning trade in New York, when the broader market was down. That's a far better outcome than the more than 25 percent slump in Rite Aid's shares. Even so, it's hardly the knockout transaction Pessina was aiming for. Given Walgreens and its executives have spent approaching two years on the deal, it may count as a dent in his strong deal-making reputation. Amid other big threats, including Amazon.com exploring the pharmacy business, all that time and effort could have been usefully directed elsewhere.BreakingviewsReuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

The jury in a Manhattan federal court said the Alavi Foundation, majority owner of an office tower at 650 Fifth Avenue, knew that its partner and the building's minority owner, Assa Corp, was a front for Iran, and helped conceal the fact. Jurors said the government had proven that the property was involved in or traceable to money laundering. The government wanted to seize the 36-story building, which could be worth nearly $1 billion, to benefit people with legal judgments against Iran relating to bombings and other attacks.  In this trial, 650 Fifth Avenue’s secret was laid bare for all to see,  said Acting U.S. Attorney Joon Kim in Manhattan, whose office represented the government.  On behalf of all of our clients, we are extremely pleased with the decision and the verdict handed down today,  said James Bernard, a lawyer for the judgment holders. The Alavi Foundation did not immediately respond to a request comment. Alavi was founded in 1973 as the Pahlavi Foundation by the then-Shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. It describes its mission as promoting the study of Persian and Islamic culture in the United States, and also funds schools and free clinics. The tower at 650 Fifth Avenue was built at the shah's behest in 1978 to provide a source of income. After the Islamic Revolution in 1979 that ousted the shah, Iran's new government replaced much of Alavi's board of directors. In 1989, Alavi entered into a partnership with Iran's state-controlled Bank Melli under which Alavi owned a majority share of the building, and the bank owned the rest through a subsidiary, Assa. The case turned on whether Alavi knew that Assa was still owned by Bank Melli after the United States imposed sanctions on Iran in 1995. Lawyers for the government argued that it did, but kept distributing rental income to Assa anyway, while working to conceal its ownership from U.S. authorities. John Gleeson, a former Brooklyn federal judge who represented Alavi, argued that the foundation was led to believe that Bank Melli was sold before the sanctions took effect.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-iran-lawsuit-idUSL1N1JQ18X"},

The government, which is trying to push an unpopular austerity agenda through Congress, posted a primary budget deficit of 29.371 billion reais ($8.88 billion) in May, compared to 15.478 billion reais in the year-earlier period. Economists in a Reuters poll had expected a deficit of 20 billion reais. The May deficit was the biggest ever recorded for that month.   The deficit in the 12 months through May reached 167.6 billion reais, equivalent to 2.59 percent of gross domestic product. The official target for 2017 is for a deficit of 139 billion reais. Economists are forecasting it will be 142 billion reais, according to a Finance Ministry survey. Treasury Secretary Ana Paula Vescovi told journalists the deficit widened last month mainly due to a decision to service judicial debts ahead of schedule, a move she said would help save between 600 million and 700 million reais this year. She added that measures under discussion, including a farm tax renegotiation, could boost extraordinary revenues by about 15 billion reais this year. President Michel Temer's government, stung by the loss of Brazil's investment-grade rating, has signaled it is ready to raise taxes later this year if needed to hit the budget target as weaker-than-expected economic growth weighs on tax revenues.

It's something that is achievable in the coming months,  Niel said in an interview with Reuters on the site, dubbed Station F, which plans to house 1,000 start-ups under its 1920s glass arcades.  We're of course helped by Brexit,  he added. Paris and Berlin are vying to displace London's lead in the European start-up scene, while other cities including Dublin, Amsterdam and Frankfurt are also promoting themselves as alternative tech hubs in the face of uncertainties caused by the British vote to leave the European Union. Station F's 34,000 square metre (366,000 sq ft) site in Paris makes it the world's biggest startup incubator. It will shelter early stage companies, venture capital funds, a post office, a round-the-clock restaurant, a tax centre and will offer 26 programmes to help out entrepreneurs, Niel said. It will also have 3-D printing labs and bars. U.S. giants Facebook, Microsoft and South Korea's Naver partnered with the project, as well as French bank BNP Paribas, defence company Thales and French online retailer vente-privée.com. France's startup scene has been gaining traction lately thanks to booming investments and high expectations for a business-friendly government under new President Emmanuel Macron, who has said he wants to transform France into a  start-up  nation, via a mix of business-friendly reforms and the launch of a 10 billion euro ($11.4 billion) dedicated fund.  We have an environment that serves us well because foreign leaders are either old or they do not make young people dream,  Niel said. Thirty-nine-year old Macron is the youngest leader in France's modern history. Niel, a telecoms maverick who transformed France's mobile sector via the company he founded, Iliad, wholly funded Station F, investing 250 million euros in the project. Venture capitalists invested in 590 French startups in 2016, putting the country ahead of Britain (520 deals) and Germany (380), according to research firm Tech.eu. It was a record year with a total of 874 million euros invested in venture capital in France, up 15 percent from 2015, according to the industry lobby Afic.

Yet the Wimbledon crowds, who were enchanted by Willis's tale in 2016, will have an equally unlikely figure to cheer for next week in the shape of world number 855 Alex Ward, who became the only British player to get through the qualifiers. Willis, who last year was ranked 772 when he negotiated pre-qualifying, qualifying and a first round match to earn a fairytale Centre Court tie with Roger Federer, this time struggled with injury in his 6-4 6-1 7-6(4) loss to Ukraine's  Illya Marchenko.  Yet Ward positioned himself as 2017's answer to Willis as he reached the main draw by beating an equally improbable path to the two-week grand slam that starts on Monday, culminating in a shock final qualifying round victory over Teymuraz Gabashvili. The Russian was ranked 679 places higher on the ATP computer than Ward but the 27-year-old Englishman still prevailed 6-7(3) 6-4 7-6(6) 6-1. Ward could not hide his delight at his unlikely progress. He had lost in the final round of pre-qualifying only to be granted a wildcard to take part in the qualifying event. Sidelined for months with a wrist injury after being a wild card entrant in last year's Wimbledon, and seeing his ranking plummet by more than 600 places, Ward is hoping now for a big show court date like the one Willis enjoyed.  I'd like to play one of the big names. That would be brilliant,  Ward told Wimbledon.com after his remarkable qualifying run this week had ended a sequence of seven straight losses.  It's amazing to qualify. I can't believe it really. It will mean everything to return to Wimbledon, especially having qualified. I feel like I really deserve my place there.  Willis, though, was left disappointed after he took a tumble in the second set against the world number 117 Marchenko. He had to have his leg heavily strapped before succumbing in straight sets.  Wimbledon will also welcome back two qualifiers responsible for a couple of the event's biggest sensations in previous editions. Czech Lukas Rosol, who defeated Rafael Nadal in 2012, and Ukraine's Sergiy Stakhovsky, conqueror of the then champion Roger Federer the following year, both negotiated their final qualifying hurdles. Rosol beat Barbadian Darian King 6-4 3-6 6-3 6-4 while Stakhovsky defeated Japan's Tatsuma Ito 6-3 6-7(2) 6-7(6) 6-4 8-6.

It did not elaborate on what the two men discussed, saying only that Kissinger was in Russia for the Primakov Readings, an annual forum of experts, diplomats and politicians. Kissinger met U.S. President Donald Trump last month, and Putin and Trump are expected to meet on the sidelines of the Group of Twenty summit in Germany next week, in what would be their first face-to-face meeting since Trump became president. Contacts between Russia and the United States are under intense scrutiny following allegations by U.S. intelligence officials of Russian interference in last year's U.S. presidential election. Russian officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, say they are frustrated that the Trump administration has not been able to engage effectively with Russia on important issues.  They say the issue is not Trump himself, but the stand-off inside the U.S. political system which, they say, means the U.S. president is liable to be attacked by domestic opponents if he makes any overtures towards Russia.  The officials say the amount of substantial contact Moscow has with the U.S. administration is minimal. Illustrating the sensitivities around high-level contacts, the Kremlin acknowledged on Thursday that no formal bilateral meeting between Trump and Putin was planned for the G20 summit in Germany early next month, though the two were likely to cross paths. Moscow is frustrated, according to the Russian officials, because it believes dialogue with the United States is crucial to resolving the conflict in Syria and concluding a peace deal which would allow Russia to end its military engagement there. Kissinger, as national security adviser to U.S. President Richard Nixon, established a private channel of communication with Anatoly Dobrynin, the Soviet ambassador to Washington, which historians credit with helping ease Cold War tensions.

European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said on Tuesday the ECB might tweak its stimulus so it does not become more accommodative as the economy recovers. Sources on Wednesday, however, said he had not intended to signal imminent tightening.                               Bank of England Governor Mark Carney also said on Wednesday that a rise in British interest rates is likely to be needed as the economy comes closer to running at full capacity.                  “What’s going on in Europe is really what’s driving us here,” said Brian Daingerfield, a macro strategist at NatWest Markets in Stamford, Connecticut.     Position squaring before month-end and the end of the first half of the year may also be behind the bond weakness, said Lou Brien, a market strategist at DRW Trading in Chicago.     Benchmark 10-year notes             fell 14/32 in price to yield 2.27 percent, after earlier rising to 2.30 percent, the highest since May 17.     Treasuries pared price losses as stocks declined.                  The U.S. economy will take focus on Friday when personal income and consumption data will be evaluated for inflation signals.     “Another weak number may be a factor in the pace of rate hikes going forward,  said Brien.     St Louis Fed President James Bullard said on Thursday that there is nothing left for the Fed to do on interest rates and the natural next step for the central bank would be to start trimming its balance sheet.                   Data on Thursday showed the U.S. economy slowed less sharply in the first quarter than initially estimated due to unexpectedly higher consumer spending and a bigger jump in exports.                  The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits edged up last week, but the underlying trend remained consistent with a tight labor market, other data showed.                  The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) on Thursday estimated that the U.S. will have a budget deficit of $693 billion this year, $134 billion more than its prior estimate made in January.     The CBO also said that Congress will need to raise the debt limit by  early to mid-October.

As the world struggles with a glut of grain that has filled inventories to record-highs and cast a wet blanket over the  corn and bean markets, the shortage of high-quality spring wheat has taken markets by surprise. The drought in the United States has propelled prices for the high protein grain that is prized by bread makers to three-year highs. The weekly U.S. Drought Monitor, produced by a consortium of climatologists, on Thursday showed that 25 percent of North Dakota was classified as being in  extreme drought,  up from 7.7 percent a week earlier.   MGEX spring wheat futures jumped another 5.1 percent on Thursday, hitting a peak of $7.59-3/4 a bushel. Prices have risen for six days in a row, gaining more than 14 percent during the streak. The top has been taken off,  said North Dakota State University extension agronomist Joel Ransom, referring to the crop's harvest potential.  We are kind of fixed that we cannot get back to trend line for sure.  Some North Dakota farmers were asking questions about cutting their crop for hay and using it for animal feeding, indicating that they have already given up on their wheat fields turning out profitable yields, Ransom said. Ransom added that the next 10 days were critical for determining how far below expectations the crop will fall below expectations. Much of the crop will be in its grain filling stage of development, when it needs water and cool temperatures to maximize harvest potential.   Going forward, it looks pretty dry,  said Kyle Tapley, an agricultural meteorologist with MDA Weather Services.  I really do not see much rain at all coming up over the next seven days. Conditions are going to be deteriorating once again across that area.  Temperatures also were expected to rise, Tapley added, and will likely be above normal for the next 10 days. The drought has been devastating to hardest hit ranchers in the regions reeling from rising hay costs and withered grazing pastures, said experts. The average price of grass hay has skyrocketed to around $100 per ton from roughly $60 since April, forcing cattle and sheep producers to either cull their less productive animals, and those that required the most feed, by sending them to packing plants or trucking them to neighboring states where grazing conditions are much better, said North Dakota State University livestock economist Tim Petry.

If the meeting is not called by then, minority stakeholder BNDES Participações SA has the right to do so, said the source, who was not authorized to speak publicly about the matter and requested anonymity. Brothers Wesley and Joesley Batista in May made a plea deal with prosecutors in which they admitted bribing almost 2,000 politicians, including allegedly President Michel Temer. Other minority stakeholders including state-controlled lender Caixa Econômica Federal [CEF.UL], which owns around 4 percent of JBS, support BNDES' plan to oust the Batistas, the source said. Representatives for JBS were not immediately available for comment. The Batistas, who control holding company J&F; Investimentos SA, have agreed to pay 10.3 billion reais ($3.1 billion) in fines in leniency deal.  Joesley Batista, who secretly taped Temer, was the only family member to leave the company.  State-development bank BNDES, which indirectly holds a 21 percent stake in JBS through its BNDESPar investment arm, filed a request last week that shareholders of JBS convene to change its board and management. Reuters reported on Monday that BNDESPar wanted to remove the controlling Batista family from the meatpacker's management and board. JBS Chief Executive Wesley Batista and his father José Batista Sobrinho are board members. JBS has also been ensnared in a scandal involving alleged bribing of food safety inspectors that prompted several countries to suspend imports of Brazilian meat for days.

Markets reacted badly, with stocks and the leu currency falling, and centrist President Klaus Iohannis strongly criticized the measures. Parliament gave the cabinet of Prime Minister Mihai Tudose a vote of confidence on Thursday. Tudose replaces Sorin Grindeanu, who was ousted by the ruling Social Democrats (PSD) and junior coalition partner ALDE for failing to implement the governing program that helped win them a December election. Critics said that with some leading political figures facing allegations of graft, Grindeanu was more likely fired for not doing enough to water down anti-corruption legislation. The Romania is plagued by bureaucracy and corruption. The tax changes – included in a revised governing program - and a plan to scrap a mandatory private pension pillar, which was later retracted, drove the Bucharest stock market almost 3.6 percent lower, and the leu currency down half a percent.  We find the coalition with a new government, and surprisingly, a new governing program,  Iohannis told the cabinet at its swearing-in ceremony.   Such behavior certainly does not fall within what is fiscal-budgetary predictability and … certainly induces doubts within the business environment. In the name of Romanians, I ask you to stop this fiscal-budgetary hopping.  The president, a centrist, can obstruct the changes to a limited extent. He has become a counterweight to the coalition's attempts earlier this year to weaken anti-corruption legislation and his criticism will sting. PSD leader Liviu Dragnea said the tax program had been re-worked to make up for delays. Former Finance Minister Darius Valcov, currently on trial for taking bribes, is one of its authors.  I have no other objective than enforcing the governing program and recovering the delays,  Tudose told lawmakers.  If we want campaign promises to become reality, we must forget the state of normality.  Loose fiscal plans have worried the European Commission and the International Monetary Fund over missing budget targets. The Commission expects Romania to run the EU's largest deficits this year and next. Romania's new Prime Minister Mihai Tudose attends the swearing-in ceremony at the Cotroceni Palace after winning a vote of confidence in parliament, Bucharest, Romania June 29, 2017. Inquam Photos/Octav Ganea/via REUTERSRomanian and foreign investors have repeatedly urged the PSD to ensure predictable fiscal policies.  The proposed measures have a major impact on the Romanian economy and cannot be made without public consultations and an impact assessment,  said the Coalition for Romania’s Development, which groups investors’ associations.  The nature of the proposed tax changes can affect large-scale investment and compromise the positive economic growth cycle of the Romanian economy.  Private Pensions in Focus The program plans replace the 16 percent corporate tax on profit with a progressive tax of 1-3 percent on turnover. Income tax will fall to 10 percent.  Social security contributions will fall by 4.25 percentage points to 35 percent and will be paid solely by workers, not their employers. A dividend tax will be scrapped, but a one percentage point cut to value added tax will be postponed by a year to 2019. A new solidarity tax could be enforced on people who earn more than 14,500 lei ($3,617) per month, Finance Minister Ionut Misa said, adding all data was preliminary.  In a new twist, Misa said the cabinet planned to scrap a mandatory private pension pillar that was introduced in 2008 to supplement a communist-era system. Up to 7 million Romanians contribute to mandatory private pension funds, whose assets stand at 35.1 billion lei ($8.78 billion).  Hungary and Poland have taken similar steps that had upset investors and weighed on local markets for years. PSD had vehemently denied it was planning to scrap the pension system and later on Thursday, both PSD leader Dragnea and Tudose contradicted Misa and denied the plans existed. The Romanian Private Pension Association welcomed the denial.   (The association) would like to remind that the second pillar has been one of the most successful structural reforms in Romania, which ... does not justify in any way a measure to affect its architecture,  it said in a statement.

One in five patients covered by Medicare, the federal insurance program for people over age 65, who were observed in a hospital but not admitted returned for a repeat visit within a month, researchers found. Financial incentives and disincentives have led to an increase in the number of Medicare patients who spend up to 48 hours being observed in the hospital without being admitted. Today, 1.5 million Medicare beneficiaries are observed in hospitals each year, according to Dr. Kumar Dharmarajan, who led the study. The new findings suggest that clinicians might need to focus more attention on caring for patients once they return home after being observed in the hospital, said Dharmarajan, a geriatrician and cardiologist at Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut.  “These people are quite vulnerable after discharge,” he said in a phone interview. “We need to think hard about helping improve transitions as people leave observation services.” As reported in The BMJ, Dharmarajan and his team analyzed Medicare data from 2006-2011 on hundreds of thousands of emergency department visits, observation stays and inpatient stays (that is, when patients were admitted to the hospital). The number of emergency department and inpatient stays remained the same, while the number of observation stays increased during the period. More than 20 percent of patients discharged from observation stays returned to the hospital within 30 days. In nearly half of those revisits, the patients ended up being officially admitted to the hospital, the study found. “If one in five are coming back, there probably are opportunities to improve care for these patients,” Dharmarajan said. For example, he said, protocols should be in place to ensure that patients discharged from observation stays have follow-up appointments with their physicians. “This is a group that’s been relatively neglected from an outcomes perspective, and a group that’s not going away,” he said. “Could something different have been done in the hospital the first time, and could something different have been done after they left?” Dr. Michael Ross, an emergency physician who oversees six observation units in Atlanta, Georgia, agreed that care coordination and, when possible, clinic visits within a week of observations stays can help reduce the number of patients who need to revisit hospitals after observation stays. “They’re sick patients, and anything that could be done to prevent return visits would be a step forward,” he said in a phone interview. “I can’t conclude from the paper that more could be done, but in principle, I could say there’s always more that can be done with follow-up clinic visits and home care.” Ross, a professor at Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta who was not involved in the new study, believes it suggests the need for separate observation units with clear protocols for patients who are watched by physicians for up to two days to determine if they should be admitted.  About one-third of U.S. hospitals have dedicated observation units, which Ross said have better outcomes than observation stays in other parts of hospitals. “A big gap in American healthcare is that observation patients need to be placed in dedicated observation units. In a bed anywhere, it’s the Wild West. There are no protocols,” he said. “A protocol-driven observation unit is more prone to facilitating outpatient care and making sure all patients receive complete testing before discharge,” he said. If patients don’t complete their testing in the hospital, they’re more likely to need hospital care soon again, he added.

In a roadshow in New York where he was meeting Wall Street banks, Le Maire, a conservative poached by new President Emmanuel Macron, said France no longer considered finance an enemy, in a dig to his Socialist predecessor.  Finance is not the enemy, unemployment is the enemy,  Le Maire said, referring to former president Francois Hollande who swept to power in 2012 declaring finance his enemy and imposing a now-defunct tax on millionaires. Seeking to capitalize on Macron's pro-business outlook, Le Maire told a conference at the Economic Club of New York that France would create a special court to handle disputes related to financial contracts governed by English law once Britain leaves the EU. Most loan and derivative contracts in Europe are written in English law, but Britain's exit from the European Union raises problems about how they would be enforced outside of Britain.  All proceedings will take place in English. We will hire people with experience in common law regardless of where they come from,  Le Maire said. While Macron, a former investment banker, is more relaxed about the use of English than previous French leaders, the move marks a big step for a country that takes deep pride in its language and cherishes its legal system rooted in Roman law.  Long gone are the days when you could only do business or speak to regulators in French. We will always be proud of our language, but we also understand the need to make it easier for financial institutions operating in France,  Le Maire said in a speech delivered in English. Macron's government is keen to convince Wall Street banks to dump London for Paris, hoping to override concerns about its rigid labor laws and high taxes with plans to push through reforms to make doing business easier.  Attracting major U.S. banks to Paris, rather than letting them settle in London, Dublin, Amsterdam or Frankfurt, is about creating jobs in France, bringing wealth to France,  Le Maire said. Prime Minister Edouard Philippe is to announce measures in the coming weeks to boost the attractiveness of Paris as a global financial hub, a government spokesman said on Wednesday. In New York, Le Maire was due to meet executives from banks JPMorgan, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, Lazard, private equity firm KKR, fund giant Blackrock and hedge fund Paulson & Co.  Former Bank of France governor Christian Noyer told Reuters this week that banks from London had been quietly securing licenses to operate from Paris after Brexit.

The average rent landlords are seeking in downtown climbed to $62 a square foot last month when the addition of 1.7 million square feet at 3 World Trade Center is added to the office space available for lease, the brokerage said. Since January 2011, 393 have moved in, compared with only 74 leaving, CBRE said. The relocations highlight the transformation of a Lower Manhattan hit hard by the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks into a highly desirable neighborhood. Downtown's revival has been driven by firms based in technology, advertising, media and information, or TAMI, which account for the largest amount of leasing at 30 percent. More than half of these firms chose space in buildings built before World War Two. The TAMI sector has also driven jobs growth in the city since 2010, with new employment in these firms outpacing the financial services industry, traditionally the biggest jobs creator in Manhattan. Unemployment in the city is near record lows, with the jobless rate in Manhattan last month climbing three-tenths of a percent off an all-time low of 3.5 percent in April, according to the New York State Department of Labor. The rate is lower than the U.S. unemployment rate of 4.3 percent in May. The desire of millennials to  live, work and play  in their neighborhood has helped turn Lower Manhattan more residential and upscale. The median income of people ages 18 to 44 living in Lower Manhattan is $161,739, according to the Alliance for Downtown New York, which promotes business in the area. Lower Manhattan's revival as an office market can also be seen in the narrowing of the gap to 23.5 percent from more than 43 percent a decade ago between asking rents in Midtown, a bastion of Corporate America, and downtown. The volume of leasing has climbed above a five-year average, which is another sign of the market's vitality, CBRE said. The increase in rents above $60 a square foot downtown marks a threshold, according to Colliers International, which expects to report asking rents for Lower Manhattan will be $63.46 a square foot at quarter's end.

Ana Brnabic, also Serbia's first openly gay head of government, was picked by president Aleksandar Vucic, who stepped down as prime minister to take the more ceremonial role after winning an April election in a landslide. But as head of the ruling Serbian Progressive Party (SNS), Vucic will control a parliamentary majority. The government received the support of 157 lawmakers, while 55 voted against in the 250-seat parliament. New ministers will be sworn in later in the evening. Opposition deputies said Brnabic, who is not affiliated with any party, was unlikely to have any real leverage on the work of her cabinet in which most ministers come from Vucic's SNS and the Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS). In her speech to parliament, Brnabic pledged to modernize state administration and speed up accession talks with the European Union while working on strengthening ties with Russia.  Brnabic, who was minister in charge of state administration in Vucic's cabinet, named Nenad Popovic, a well known businessman with strong links to Russia, as one of her deputies. Dusan Vujovic will remain finance minister. She added that her government would focus on achieving average economic growth of 3.5 percent a year and would tackle environmental issues, including power production from renewables and waste control -- both key elements in the Balkan state's plans to join the EU.

Markets reacted badly, with stocks and the leu currency falling, and centrist President Klaus Iohannis strongly criticized the measures. Parliament gave the cabinet of Prime Minister Mihai Tudose a vote of confidence on Thursday. Tudose replaces Sorin Grindeanu, who was ousted by the ruling Social Democrats (PSD) and junior coalition partner ALDE for failing to implement the governing program that helped win them a December election. Critics said that with some leading political figures facing allegations of graft, Grindeanu was more likely fired for not doing enough to water down anti-corruption legislation. The Romania is plagued by bureaucracy and corruption. The tax changes – included in a revised governing program - and a plan to scrap a mandatory private pension pillar, which was later retracted, drove the Bucharest stock market almost 3.6 percent lower, and the leu currency down half a percent.  We find the coalition with a new government, and surprisingly, a new governing program,  Iohannis told the cabinet at its swearing-in ceremony.   Such behavior certainly does not fall within what is fiscal-budgetary predictability and … certainly induces doubts within the business environment. In the name of Romanians, I ask you to stop this fiscal-budgetary hopping.  The president, a centrist, can obstruct the changes to a limited extent. He has become a counterweight to the coalition's attempts earlier this year to weaken anti-corruption legislation and his criticism will sting. PSD leader Liviu Dragnea said the tax program had been re-worked to make up for delays. Former Finance Minister Darius Valcov, currently on trial for taking bribes, is one of its authors.  I have no other objective than enforcing the governing program and recovering the delays,  Tudose told lawmakers.  If we want campaign promises to become reality, we must forget the state of normality.  Loose fiscal plans have worried the European Commission and the International Monetary Fund over missing budget targets. The Commission expects Romania to run the EU's largest deficits this year and next. Romania's new Prime Minister Mihai Tudose attends the swearing-in ceremony at the Cotroceni Palace after winning a vote of confidence in parliament, Bucharest, Romania June 29, 2017. Inquam Photos/Octav Ganea/via REUTERSRomanian and foreign investors have repeatedly urged the PSD to ensure predictable fiscal policies.  The proposed measures have a major impact on the Romanian economy and cannot be made without public consultations and an impact assessment,  said the Coalition for Romania’s Development, which groups investors’ associations.  The nature of the proposed tax changes can affect large-scale investment and compromise the positive economic growth cycle of the Romanian economy.  Private Pensions in Focus The program plans replace the 16 percent corporate tax on profit with a progressive tax of 1-3 percent on turnover. Income tax will fall to 10 percent.  Social security contributions will fall by 4.25 percentage points to 35 percent and will be paid solely by workers, not their employers. A dividend tax will be scrapped, but a one percentage point cut to value added tax will be postponed by a year to 2019. A new solidarity tax could be enforced on people who earn more than 14,500 lei ($3,617) per month, Finance Minister Ionut Misa said, adding all data was preliminary.  In a new twist, Misa said the cabinet planned to scrap a mandatory private pension pillar that was introduced in 2008 to supplement a communist-era system. Up to 7 million Romanians contribute to mandatory private pension funds, whose assets stand at 35.1 billion lei ($8.78 billion).  Hungary and Poland have taken similar steps that had upset investors and weighed on local markets for years. PSD had vehemently denied it was planning to scrap the pension system and later on Thursday, both PSD leader Dragnea and Tudose contradicted Misa and denied the plans existed. The Romanian Private Pension Association welcomed the denial.   (The association) would like to remind that the second pillar has been one of the most successful structural reforms in Romania, which ... does not justify in any way a measure to affect its architecture,  it said in a statement.

The S&P; 500 Bank sector index .SPXBK rose as much as 3 percent to its highest point since March 17 and was last up 1.3 percent. Regions Financial (RF.N) was the biggest percentage gainer of the 34 banks involved in the stress tests with a 3 percent jump. A total shareholder payout estimate of $132 billion compared with expectations for $120 billion from Barclays analyst Jonathan Goldberg including the 22 banks his firm covers. RBC analysts estimated a total payout of $137 billion for the 25 banks it covers compared with its expectation of $126 billion. Regions' $1.8 billion payout plan topped RBC's $1.2 billion estimate.   Generally speaking there were high expectations and they came in above that,  said Barclay's Goldberg. JPMorgan Chase & Co's (JPM.N) buyback alone is around the same amount as the gross domestic product of Iceland or the entire market value of KeyCorp (KEY.N), Goldberg noted. Capital One Financial Corp (COF.N) was one of nine companies whose shares fell on Thursday after the Fed said it must resubmit its scheme by year-end, though it can go ahead with its capital plan in the meantime. Its shares were down 2.9 percent. The stress test showed that many of the banks involved have not only built up adequate capital buffers but also improved risk management, the Fed said late on Wednesday. The approval was a victory for the industry, which has worked to regain its stature since the 2007-2009 financial crisis, and marked the first time since the crisis that banks could pay out as much as they report in annual profits.  Citigroup Inc (C.N) shares were up 2.2 percent, Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) 2 percent, Fifth Third (FITB.O) 2 percent and Zions Bancorp (ZION.O) 1.7 percent. Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) was up 1.2 percent while JPMorgan added 0.9 percent, and Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) rose 0.54 percent. Morgan Stanley (MS.N) shares were up 0.3 percent.

The agency plans to deploy a team of senior reviewers with expertise in drugs to treat diseases with 200,000 patients or fewer, known as orphan drugs. The goal will be to eliminate a backlog of 200 orphan drug designation requests, starting with the oldest. The agency aims to clear the backlog by mid-September. Pharmaceutical companies have become increasingly interested in developing orphan drugs since they can command prices in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. Soliris, for example, a drug made by Alexion Pharmaceuticals Inc to treat paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, a rare disease that destroys red blood cells, can cost up to $440,000 a year. In 2016 the FDA received 568 new requests for orphan drug designation, more than double the number received in 2012.  Congress gave us tools to incentivize the development of novel therapies for rare diseases and we intend to use these resources to their fullest extent,  FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said in a statement.  The agency is in a broad push to speed new drugs to the market, a mandate expressed in legislation passed last year known as the 21st Century Cures Act. On Tuesday the FDA released a list of roughly 180 drugs that have lost patent protection but have no generic rivals, and said it will prioritize applications of generic competition for these drugs. The goal is to prevent the kind of price hikes seen when Martin Shkreli, formerly chief executive officer of Turing Pharmaceuticals, acquired and then raised the price of an old anti-parasitic drug called Daraprim to $750 a pill from $13.50. The agency plans to respond to orphan drug applicants within 90 days of receiving an application and establish an Orphan Products Council to help ensure the FDA is applying a consistent approach to regulating and reviewing these products. Drugs that win orphan drug status are given a variety of incentives, including tax credits and eligibility for seven years of marketing exclusivity.

The average rent landlords are seeking in downtown climbed to $62 a square foot last month when the addition of 1.7 million square feet at 3 World Trade Center is added to the office space available for lease, the brokerage said. Since January 2011, 393 have moved in, compared with only 74 leaving, CBRE said. The relocations highlight the transformation of a Lower Manhattan hit hard by the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks into a highly desirable neighborhood. Downtown's revival has been driven by firms based in technology, advertising, media and information, or TAMI, which account for the largest amount of leasing at 30 percent. More than half of these firms chose space in buildings built before World War Two. The TAMI sector has also driven jobs growth in the city since 2010, with new employment in these firms outpacing the financial services industry, traditionally the biggest jobs creator in Manhattan. Unemployment in the city is near record lows, with the jobless rate in Manhattan last month climbing three-tenths of a percent off an all-time low of 3.5 percent in April, according to the New York State Department of Labor. The rate is lower than the U.S. unemployment rate of 4.3 percent in May. The desire of millennials to  live, work and play  in their neighborhood has helped turn Lower Manhattan more residential and upscale. The median income of people ages 18 to 44 living in Lower Manhattan is $161,739, according to the Alliance for Downtown New York, which promotes business in the area. Lower Manhattan's revival as an office market can also be seen in the narrowing of the gap to 23.5 percent from more than 43 percent a decade ago between asking rents in Midtown, a bastion of Corporate America, and downtown. The volume of leasing has climbed above a five-year average, which is another sign of the market's vitality, CBRE said. The increase in rents above $60 a square foot downtown marks a threshold, according to Colliers International, which expects to report asking rents for Lower Manhattan will be $63.46 a square foot at quarter's end.

For the study, researchers asked 196 scientists to predict whether six mouse experiments published in prominent medical journals could be reproduced - that is, done again achieving the same results with the same effect size, such as shrinking tumors by the same amount, and the same level of statistical significance, meaning the findings aren’t simply due to chance.  None of the six experiments researchers asked scientists to review got the same statistical significance or effect size when they were repeated by investigators at the Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology, a collaboration between the Science Exchange and the Center for Open Science that is independently testing the reliability of experiments published in prominent medical journals (osf.io/e81xl/).  But, on average, scientists participating in the survey predicted a 75 percent probability of reproducing the statistical significance and a 50 percent probability of getting the same effect size.  “This is the first study of its type, but it warrants further investigation to understand how scientists interpret major reports,” said senior study author Jonathan Kimmelman of McGill University in Montreal.  “I think there is probably good reason to think that some of the problems we have in science are not because people are sloppy at the bench, but because there is room for improvement in the way they interpret findings,” Kimmelman said by email.  The work follows on numerous reports exploring biomedicine’s reproducibility crisis. In the last 10 or 15 years, there have been mounting concerns that some of the techniques and practices used in biomedical research lead to inaccurate assessments of a drug’s clinical promise, Kimmelman’s team writes in PLoS Biology. The results do, however, raise the possibility that training might help many scientists overcome certain cognitive biases that affect their interpretation of scientific reports, the researchers propose.  The study team asked both established cancer scientists and trainees in elite education programs to assess the six mouse experiments, and they found the more experienced and more influential scientists tended to be more accurate. “What is surprising here is that researchers are not very accurate, actually they are less accurate than chance, at predicting whether a study will replicate,” said Dr. Benjamin Neel, director of New York University’s Perlmutter Cancer Center.  Study participants reported their own level of expertise in the field, however, they were not, on average, the most influential scientists as measured by how many publications they had and how often other researchers cited their work, Neel, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.  “Probably the biggest reason the studies don’t hold up is because the sample size is too small. For example, if only 5 to 10 mice are used, a 50-animal study might not yield the same result,” Neel said. “I think all pre-clinical results should be validated by an independent laboratory before they are used as the basis for clinical trials,” he added.  For patients, even the experiments that fail in mice or can’t be reproduced can help scientists determine if human research is possible, a necessary step in discovering new treatments, said Dr. Anthony Olszanski, director of the phase 1 developmental therapeutics program at Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia.  “Today, it is very hard to predict if promising results in preclinical studies will be seen in humans,” Olszanski, who wasn’t involved in the current study, said by email. “However, the majority of effective anti-cancer agents used today became medicines based, in part, on the findings of early researchers.” SOURCE: bit.ly/1BYqPuv PLoS Biology, online June 29, 2017.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-cancer-science-reproducibility-idUSKBN19K2ND"},

We are exploring all possible legal avenues, including, but not limited to, the (WTO) Dispute Settlement Body,  Ali Alwaleed al-Thani, director of Qatar's WTO office, told Reuters. The feud erupted this month when the four countries severed diplomatic and travel links, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorism and regional foe Iran. Qatar denies the accusations. Al-Thani said the measures went against the fundamental principles of WTO laws, including agreements on trade in goods, services and intellectual property rights, as well as the WTO trade facilitation agreement, supposed to cut red tape at customs and speed cross-border trade.   They were among the first countries to ratify this agreement and now the first to violate it,  he said.  There are also issues regarding international maritime law and air transport rights.  The WTO dispute system can end with costly trade sanctions imposed on wrongdoers, but it normally takes at least two or three years and sometimes much longer.  We work under the premise that these measures are going to be in place for a while. It’s not necessarily so, but we have to work under this premise,  al-Thani said. National Security  He expected the four countries to cite national security as a reason for the trade restrictions, an exemption permitted by the WTO but one that has never been used in its 22-year history. Trade experts refer to it as the  nuclear option  because of the potential systemic damage it might do to the WTO. Such a defense could be challenged on the grounds of proportionality and necessity, al-Thani said.  What’s the national security value of limiting exports of milk to Qatar?  On Wednesday, Britain's The Guardian newspaper published an interview with the UAE's ambassador to Russia, in which he said more economic sanctions could follow, including forcing other countries to choose between trading with Qatar or its accusers. Al-Thani said that would violate WTO rules.  It would be unfathomable for a member to ask other members to choose their trading partners,  he said. The UAE, Saudi Arabia and Bahrain are members with Qatar of the Gulf Cooperation Council, a trading club with a common customs border.    The customs union is going through a tough time. Will it survive?  al-Thani said.  With regards to the actual trade effect, it would be relatively easy for us to readjust.   We’re mostly a net importer from within the GCC, so it’s the countries that are imposing the blockade that stand to lose most,  he said, adding Qatar was continuing to sell gas to the UAE via the Dolphin pipeline and directly by ship.   It’s solving a headache by shooting yourself in the head, which is not necessarily the way political issues should be resolved,  he said.   Qatar's main concern was imports of food and dairy products.  We are finding alternatives, diversifying our supply and also expanding domestic production,  he said.

But ask bond traders what the impact will be, or how they are strategizing around the so-called  taper,  and get little more than a yawn. In interviews, trading executives at Wall Street banks said they are not expecting much to happen just because the Fed is finally whittling down its balance sheet. Investors largely expected the move, and want to see other policy changes from Washington and from central banks abroad before shifting their portfolios, they said.  Because the Fed has been talking about the taper for four years, people have heard enough about it,  Chris Leonard, head of U.S. rates trading at Barclays PLC, told Reuters.  They feel like they're prepared.  On June 14, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates for the third time since December, and said it would start reducing its $4.2 trillion portfolio of Treasury bonds, mortgage-backed securities and federal agency debt that it had purchased to support markets and the broader economy. This week, central bankers in Europe indicated that they may start tightening monetary policy as well, offering a quick shot in the arm for bond markets. But the process is expected to take a long time, trading executives said. The majority of assets the Fed plans to wind down are not scheduled to mature for at least five years. Europe has only begun to talk about hiking rates and being less accommodative. Instead of cheering the moves, trading executives pointed to signs that the bond market does not much care about the Fed's balance sheet shrinkage, and noted that upticks in bond yields like those following comments from central bankers in England and Europe this week have not lasted long in recent years. Volatility remains near historic lows, as do 10-year Treasury bond yields. And the difference between short-term and long-term interest rates has narrowed, suggesting there are concerns about the long-term health of the economy. All of this bodes poorly for second-quarter profits at big Wall Street banks like JPMorgan Chase & Co, Citigroup Inc, Bank of America Corp, Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Morgan Stanley, whose bond trading businesses have been suffering for years due to a combination of low rates, weak trading activity and new regulations. At recent industry conferences, senior bank executives have told analysts and investors to expect declines of 10 to 15 percent in trading revenue when they report second-quarter results next month, due in large part to weak bond market activity. Stock analysts have been issuing gloomier forecasts for similar reasons.  Going into the slower part of the year, we still see some value, but the group has its work cut out for it to justify '18 estimates,  Evercore ISI analyst Glenn Schorr wrote about the Wall Street banks he covers in a Wednesday report cutting profit forecasts. The latest troubles come on top of a 51 percent decline in annual bond trading revenue across Wall Street since 2009, according to research firm Coalition. For conditions to change, investors need to see more evidence that the U.S. economy is poised for meaningful growth and that other global economies are truly on a stronger footing, trading executives said. One head of U.S. Treasury trading said his clients were more disappointed that the White House and Congress had not been able to make progress on tax reform or infrastructure spending than they were encouraged by the Fed's widely expected decision. In the meantime, there is skepticism that economic conditions will improve as much and as quickly as central banks have been indicating, said the executive, who was not authorized to speak publicly.  The market was betting on (growth) heavily going into 2017 and in the meantime oil has declined and inflation has declined,  he said.  It's almost as of the market wants to see it before it prices it in.

Heeding a call from the public audit office for action, Philippe said his government would come up with savings rather than tax hikes to plug the more than 8 billion euro shortfall.  As I speak, our debt rises every second. We can't do that to our children. They shouldn't be the ones paying for this,  he said in a rare televised address by a serving prime minister.  Under the president's authority, the government will put an end to the continuous spiraling increases in our deficits,  said the former conservative mayor appointed by Emmanuel Macron last month. Elected in May on pledges to reform the economy, the president faces a first major test to find the extra savings deemed necessary by the Cour des Comptes audit office, after the last government overspent in its final months. Unless cuts are made, the public sector deficit will reach 3.2 percent of economic output this year, exceeding the previous Socialist-led government's 2.8 percent target.  This situation requires a big effort to keep spending in control,  Cour des Comptes head Didier Migaud told journalists, urging the new government to break with its predecessor's habit of under-budgeting expenditures. The auditor estimated savings of up to 5 billion euros ($5.7 billion) would be required if Macron's government is to respect its pledge to post a deficit of 3.0 percent or less this year, honoring an EU-agreed limit for the first time in a decade. Credibility France's fiscal credibility with its European partners and Germany in particular has long suffered from Paris' repeated failure to keep to the EU limit, which it has broken in 12 of the last 15 years.  All these tricks place France in a situation of major weakness vis-a-vis our European partners,  Philippe said, blaming his predecessors for making what he called  blank cheques . Last year France posted the biggest deficit in the European Union after Spain, at 3.4 percent, which the public auditor said was the legacy of years of slower deficit reduction than other states and faster spending growth. Government ministers had made no secret they expected bad news. By ordering the audit and preparing public opinion about possible belt-tightening measures, Macron's government is keen not to repeat his predecessor's mistake, who became irredeemably unpopular by abruptly raising taxes at the start of his mandate in the face of a gaping deficit.  Emmanuel Macron has learnt the lessons from Francois Hollande's mistake in mid-2012 who did not communicate enough on the tough situation of public finances,  former budget minister Christian Eckert said in a blog post. The auditor warned that 2018 would be tricky if the government were to trim a further 0.5 percentage points from the deficit as planned, especially as higher spending is expected on security, infrastructure and local authorities. To keep deficit reduction on track, spending growth would have to be kept to no more than the rate of inflation. It has run 0.9 percent annually on average between 2011 and 2016, the audit office said. Macron's campaign platform included plans for 60 billion euros in budget savings over his five-year term, but details are scarce and it also calls for 50 billion euros in investment, as well as tax cuts. The public auditor said the central state's budget was running 5.9 billion euros over budget with 2.3 billion of that going to the recapitalization of nuclear group Areva.

Ana Brnabic, also Serbia's first openly gay head of government, was picked by president Aleksandar Vucic, who stepped down as prime minister to take the more ceremonial role after winning an April election in a landslide. But as head of the ruling Serbian Progressive Party (SNS), Vucic will control a parliamentary majority. The government received the support of 157 lawmakers, while 55 voted against in the 250-seat parliament. New ministers will be sworn in later in the evening. Opposition deputies said Brnabic, who is not affiliated with any party, was unlikely to have any real leverage on the work of her cabinet in which most ministers come from Vucic's SNS and the Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS). In her speech to parliament, Brnabic pledged to modernize state administration and speed up accession talks with the European Union while working on strengthening ties with Russia.  Brnabic, who was minister in charge of state administration in Vucic's cabinet, named Nenad Popovic, a well known businessman with strong links to Russia, as one of her deputies.

Moller-Maersk (MAERSKb.CO) two days ago, showing the scale of the damage a computer virus can unleash on the technology dependent and inter-connected industry. About 90 percent of world trade is transported by sea, with ships and ports acting as the arteries of the global economy. Ports increasingly rely on communications systems to keep operations running smoothly, and any IT glitches can create major disruptions for complex logistic supply chains. The cyber attack was among the biggest-ever disruptions to hit global shipping. Several port terminals run by a Maersk division, including in the United States, India, Spain, the Netherlands, were still struggling to revert to normal operations on Thursday after experiencing massive disruptions.  South Florida Container Terminal, for example, said dry cargo could not be delivered and no container would be received. Anil Diggikar, chairman of JNPT port, near the Indian commercial hub of Mumbai, told Reuters that he did not know  when exactly the terminal will be running smoothly .  His uncertainty was echoed by Maersk itself, which told Reuters that a number of IT systems were still shut down and that it could not say when normal business operations would be resumed.  It said it was not able to comment on specific questions regarding the breach of its IT systems or the state of its cyber security as it had  all available hands focused on practical stuff and getting things back to normal .  The impact of the attack on the company has reverberated across the industry given its position as the world's biggest container shipping line and also operator of 76 ports via its APM Terminals division.   Container ships transport much of the world's consumer goods and food, while dry bulk ships haul commodities including coal and grain and tankers carry vital oil and gas supplies.  As Maersk is about 18 percent of all container trade, can you imagine the panic this must be causing in the logistic chain of all those cargo owners all over the world?  said Khalid Hashim, managing director of Precious Shipping (PSL.BK), one of Thailand's largest dry cargo ship owners.    Right now none of them know where any of their cargoes (or)containers are. And this 'black hole' of lack of knowledge will continue till Maersk are able to bring back their systems on line.   Back to Basics The computer virus, which researchers are calling GoldenEye or Petya, began its spread on Tuesday in Ukraine and affected companies in dozens of countries. Maersk said the attack had caused outages at its computer systems across the world. In an example of the turmoil that ensued, the unloading of vessels at the group's Tacoma terminal was severely slowed on Tuesday and Wednesday, said Dean McGrath, president of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union Local 23 there. The terminal is a key supply line for the delivery of domestic goods such as milk and groceries and construction materials to Anchorage, Alaska.  They went back to basics and did everything on paper,  McGrath said.     Ong Choo Kiat, President of U-Ming Marine Transport (2606.TW), Taiwan's largest dry bulk ship owner, said the fact Maersk had been affected rang alarm bells for the whole shipping industry as the Danish company was regarded as a leader in IT technology.   But they ended up one of the first few casualties. I therefore conclude that shipping is lacking behind the other industry in term of cyber security,  he said.   How long would it takes to catch up? I don't know. But recently all owners and operators are definitely more aware of the risk of cyber security and beginning to pay more attention to it.   In a leading transport survey by international law firm Norton Rose Fulbright published this week, 87 percent of respondents from the shipping industry believed cyber attacks would increase over the next five years - a level that was higher than counterparts in the aviation, rail and logistics industries.  Vulnerable Apart from the reliance on computer systems, ships themselves are increasingly exposed to interference through electronic navigation devices such as the Global Positioning System (GPS) and lack the backup systems airliners have to prevent crashes, according to cyber security experts. There were no indications that GPS and other electronic navigation aids were affected by this week's attack, but security specialists say such systems are vulnerable to signal loss from deliberate jamming by hackers. Last year, South Korea said hundreds of fishing vessels had returned early to port after its GPS signals were jammed by North Korea, which denied responsibility.  The Maersk attack raises our awareness of the vulnerability of shipping and ports to technological failure,  said Professor David Last, a previous president of Britain's Royal Institute of Navigation.  When GPS fails, ships' captains lose their principal means of navigation and much of their communications and computer links. They have to slow down and miss port schedules,  said Last, who is also a strategic advisor to the General Lighthouse Authorities of the UK and Ireland. A number of countries including the UK and the United States are looking into deploying a radar based back up navigation system for ships called eLoran, but this will take time to develop.  David Nordell, head of strategy and policy for London-based think tank, the Centre for Strategic Cyberspace and Security Science, said the global shipping and port industries were vulnerable to cyber attack, because their operating technologies tend to be old.  It's certainly possible to imagine that two container ships, or, even worse, oil or gas tankers, could be hacked into colliding, resulting in loss of life and cargo, and perhaps total loss of the vessels,  Nordell said.   Carried out in a strategically sensitive location such as the Malacca Straits or the Bosphorus, a collision like this could block shipping for enough time to cause serious dislocations to trade.  Secretive Industry Cyber risks also pose challenges for insurance cover.     In a particularly secretive industry, information about the nature of cyber attacks is still scarce, which insurance and shipping officials say is an obstacle to mitigating the risk, which means there are gaps in insurance cover available.  There has been a lot of non-reporting (of breaches) on ships, and we’re trying efforts where even if there could be anonymous reporting on a platform so we can start to get the information and the data,  said Andrew Kinsey, senior marine consultant at insurer Allianz Global Corporate & Specialty. There is also a gap in provision, because most existing cyber or hull insurance policies - which insure the ship itself - will not cover the risk of a navigation system being jammed or physical damage to the ship caused by a hacking attack.  The industry is just waking up to its vulnerability,  said Colin Gillespie, deputy director of loss prevention with ship insurer North.    Perhaps it is time for insurers, reinsurers, ship operators and port operators to sit down together and consider these risks in detail. A collective response is needed - we are all under attack.

Bunnings halted the planned closure of several Homebase stores a year ago, and is investing 500 million pounds to convert the entire Homebase estate to the Bunnings name and format in three years. The piloting of new stores comes at a time when British consumer confidence has plunged following the political crisis sparked by Prime Minister Theresa May's election gamble that backfired.

Cablevision, a cable TV provider owned by Televisa, said a Mexico City tribunal on Wednesday upheld a previous order to suspend the importation and distribution of the devices.  Cablevision cannot allow the content that it licenses from domestic and foreign companies to be illegally used,  Cablevision spokeswoman Maria Eugenia Zurita told Reuters via email.  We would also like Roku Inc to better supervise the use of its software so that it's not used inappropriately.  Connected to televisions, Roku devices provide access to Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, Starz and other services over the Internet. They and similar products are a major part of a consumer trend away from cable television in recent years. Los Gatos, California-based Roku disagrees with Wednesday's court ruling and will continue legal efforts to ensure it is able to distribute its products in Mexico, General Counsel Steve Kay said in a statement.   Today's decision is not the final word in this complex legal matter, and it is not expected to prevent consumers from purchasing Roku products in Mexico at this time,  Kay said. Hackers in Mexico use messaging app WhatsApp to offer Roku owners illegal access to monthly packages of hundreds of television channels, including Televisa's, HBO, ESPN and others.  In some cases, customers make cash transfers at convenience stores and then send the hackers photos of their receipts. A judge last week issued a court order requested by Cablevision to stop the importation and sale of the Roku devices, but Roku then won a suspension. Wednesday's decision overturned that suspension.  Following the latest ruling, Roku devices on Thursday were available for purchase on the Mexican websites of Amazon.com, Best Buy and Wal Mart de Mexico. Roku accounted for nearly half of all over-the-top streaming devices in the United States last year, according to market research firm comScore.

The country's top derivatives regulator said three former traders, Jeremy Lao and Shlomo Salant of New York and Daniel Liao of Japan, had all cooperated with the CFTC into its investigation of illegal  spoofing  - a manipulative trading tactic in which traders create the false appearance of market interest by placing orders and then immediately cancel them. The CFTC had previously fined Citigroup $25 million in the case, which involved spoofing of U.S. Treasury futures. That was the first time a bank had been charged with spoofing since the CFTC won broad new powers in the 2010 Dodd-Frank law to go after the practice. In March, the CFTC also filed civil charges against two other traders in connection with the case, ordering them to pay fines and face a six-month suspension. But James McDonald, the newly minted head of the CFTC's Enforcement Division, said in a statement on Thursday that Lao, Liao and Salant stood out and were deserving of a non-prosecution deal.  For many types of complex cases, there is simply no substitute for cooperating witnesses, who can tell the inside story of the fraud or misconduct at issue,  he said in a statement.  That’s exactly what happened here:  These traders readily admitted their own wrongdoing, identified misconduct of others, and provided other valuable information, all of which expedited our investigation and strengthened our cases against the other wrongdoers.  An attorney for the three traders did not have an immediate comment on the case. As part of the deal, the three former traders admitted to wrongdoing, the CFTC said. Non-prosecution agreements are not uncommon in other parts of the government. The Justice Department has often used them in its cases, and the Securities and Exchange Commission incorporated them into its enforcement program a few years ago as well. The CFTC had not done so until now. In January, the regulator laid out new guidance that is designed to entice companies and individuals to better cooperate during investigations.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-cftc-citigroup-idUSL1N1JQ1FY"},

Heeding a call from the public audit office for action, Philippe said his government would come up with savings rather than tax hikes to plug the more than 8 billion euro shortfall.  As I speak, our debt rises every second. We can't do that to our children. They shouldn't be the ones paying for this,  he said in a rare televised address by a serving prime minister.  Under the president's authority, the government will put an end to the continuous spiraling increases in our deficits,  said the former conservative mayor appointed by Emmanuel Macron last month. Elected in May on pledges to reform the economy, the president faces a first major test to find the extra savings deemed necessary by the Cour des Comptes audit office, after the last government overspent in its final months. Unless cuts are made, the public sector deficit will reach 3.2 percent of economic output this year, exceeding the previous Socialist-led government's 2.8 percent target.  This situation requires a big effort to keep spending in control,  Cour des Comptes head Didier Migaud told journalists, urging the new government to break with its predecessor's habit of under-budgeting expenditures. The auditor estimated savings of up to 5 billion euros ($5.7 billion) would be required if Macron's government is to respect its pledge to post a deficit of 3.0 percent or less this year, honoring an EU-agreed limit for the first time in a decade. Credibility France's fiscal credibility with its European partners and Germany in particular has long suffered from Paris' repeated failure to keep to the EU limit, which it has broken in 12 of the last 15 years.  All these tricks place France in a situation of major weakness vis-a-vis our European partners,  Philippe said, blaming his predecessors for making what he called  blank cheques . Last year France posted the biggest deficit in the European Union after Spain, at 3.4 percent, which the public auditor said was the legacy of years of slower deficit reduction than other states and faster spending growth. Government ministers had made no secret they expected bad news. By ordering the audit and preparing public opinion about possible belt-tightening measures, Macron's government is keen not to repeat his predecessor's mistake, who became irredeemably unpopular by abruptly raising taxes at the start of his mandate in the face of a gaping deficit.  Emmanuel Macron has learnt the lessons from Francois Hollande's mistake in mid-2012 who did not communicate enough on the tough situation of public finances,  former budget minister Christian Eckert said in a blog post. The auditor warned that 2018 would be tricky if the government were to trim a further 0.5 percentage points from the deficit as planned, especially as higher spending is expected on security, infrastructure and local authorities. To keep deficit reduction on track, spending growth would have to be kept to no more than the rate of inflation. It has run 0.9 percent annually on average between 2011 and 2016, the audit office said. Macron's campaign platform included plans for 60 billion euros in budget savings over his five-year term, but details are scarce and it also calls for 50 billion euros in investment, as well as tax cuts. The public auditor said the central state's budget was running 5.9 billion euros over budget with 2.3 billion of that going to the recapitalization of nuclear group Areva.

Cyber security firms are trying to piece together who was behind the computer worm, dubbed NotPetya by some experts, which has paralyzed thousands of machines worldwide, shutting down ports, factories and offices as it spread through internal organizational networks to an estimated 60 countries. Ukrainian politicians were quick on Tuesday to blame Russia, but a Kremlin spokesman dismissed  unfounded blanket accusations . Kiev has accused Moscow of two previous cyber strikes on the Ukrainian power grid and other attacks since Russia annexed Crimea in 2014.  A growing consensus among security researchers, armed with technical evidence, suggests the main purpose of the attack was to install new malware on computers at government and commercial organizations in Ukraine. Rather than extortion, the goal may be to plant the seeds of future sabotage, experts said. International firms appear to have been hit through their operations in the country.  Slovakian security software firm ESET released statistics on Thursday showing 75 percent of the infections detected among its global customer base were in Ukraine, and that all of the top 10 countries hit were located in central, eastern or southern Europe. Arne Schoenbohm, president of BSI, Germany's federal cyber security agency, told Reuters in an interview on Thursday that most of the damage from the attack had hit Ukraine, and Russia to a lesser extent, with only a few dozen German firms affected.  In all of the known cases, the companies were first infected through a Ukrainian subsidiary,  the German official said. Smokescreen Ukraine's cyber police said in a statement on Thursday morning that it had received 1,500 requests for help from individuals and companies in connection with the virus. The malicious code in the new virus encrypted data on computers and demanded victims pay a $300 ransom, similar to the extortion tactic used in a global WannaCry ransomware attack in May.  A top Ukrainian police official told Reuters that the extortion demands were likely a smokescreen, echoing working hypotheses from top cyber security firms, who consider NotPetya a  wiper , or tool for destroying data and wiping hard disks clean, that is disguised as ransomware.   Since the virus was modified to encrypt all data and make decryption impossible, the likelihood of it being done to install new malware is high,  the official, who declined to be identified, wrote in a phone text message to Reuters. Information Systems Security Partners (ISSP), a Kiev-based cyber research firm that has investigated previous cyber attacks against Ukraine, is pursuing the same line of inquiry. ISSP said that given that few people actually paid the $300 demanded for removing the virus, money was unlikely to be the primary object of the attack.   It's highly likely that during this attack new attacks were set up,  said ISSP chairman Oleg Derevianko.  At almost all organizations whose network domains were infected, not all computers went offline,  he said by phone.  Why didn't they all go offline? We are trying to understand what they might have left on those machines that weren't hit.  Ukraine's National Security and Defence Council Secretary Oleksandr Turchynov said the virus was first and foremost spread through an update issued by an accounting services and business management software.   Also involved was the hosting service of an internet provider, which the SBU (Ukraine's state security service) has already questioned about cooperation with Russian intelligence agencies,  he said, according to a statement.  Destructive Intent Technical experts familiar with the recent history of the cyber escalation between Russia and Ukraine, say these latest attacks are part of the wider political and military conflict, although no  smoking gun  has been found to identify the culprits. John Hultquist, a cyber intelligence analyst with FireEye, said the failed ransomware attack disguises an as yet unseen destructive motive.  If it were an attack masquerading as crime, that would not be unprecedented at all,  Hultquist said. Some cyber security researchers have said the fact that the Kremlin's two flagship energy companies are victims of the attack could suggest Moscow was not behind it. Russian oil major Rosneft was one of the first companies to reveal it had been compromised by the virus and sources told Reuters on Thursday computers at state gas giant Gazprom had also been infected.  For technical reasons, NotPetya appears to be more targeted than last month's global ransomware attack, known as WannaCry. When first infected by WannaCry, computers scanned the internet globally for other vulnerable machines. By contrast, NotPetya does not randomly scan the Internet to find new computers to infect. It only spreads itself inside organizational networks, taking advantage of a variety of legitimate network administration tools. This makes it far harder for anti-virus software or network security technicians to detect. It also gives it the capacity to infect other Windows computers, even those with the latest security patches, several security firms warned on Thursday.  Petya is proving to be more sophisticated than WannaCry in terms of scope, ability to be neutralized, and apparently, the motivation behind its launch,  corporate security consulting firm Kroll has advised its clients.  So far, NotPetya appears only to have been distributed inside Ukraine via a handful of so-called  watering-hole attacks  - by piggy-backing on the software updating feature of a popular national tax accounting program known as MEDoc. Kaspersky, a global cyber security firm based in Russia, also said they found a second distribution point on a local news site in the city of Bakhmut, Ukraine, which infected visitors who clicked on the site with the ransomware-like attack.  Our analysis indicates the main purpose of the attack was not financial gain, but widespread destruction,  said Costin Raiu, Kaspersky’s global head of research.  NotPetya ..combined elements of a targeted watering hole attack we’ve traditionally seen used by nation states with traditional software exploitation to devastate a specific user base,  Lesley Carhart, a Chicago-based security researcher, wrote in a blog widely shared online by top security experts.

Macedonia was thrown into political turmoil in 2015, when opposition parties accused former Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski and his counter-intelligence chief of orchestrating the wiretapping of more than 20,000 people. The crisis prompted the EU to broker an agreement in which parties agreed to hold early elections and establish the office of the special prosecutor to investigate the content of the wiretaps. On Thursday Special Prosecutor Katica Janeva told reporters that her office had filed charges against 94 people and seven legal entities in 17 cases, the state-run MIA news agency reported.   These cases are all clearly related to abuse of institutional capacities, by both individuals and organized groups, abuse of office and also violation of public procurement procedure,  the agency quoted Janeva as saying.  She said the evidence would be presented to a court which would then decide on filing indictments.  Janeva said she was considering asking for the detention of 18 people including a party leader, but gave no names. Macedonian media said Gruevski and his former interior minister Gordana Jankulovska were among the 18.  This is a political process aimed at destroying the VMRO-DPMNE officials,  MIA quoted Gruevski as telling a news conference on Thursday, referring to his party.  Gruevski stepped down last year as part of the EU-brokered agreement to allow early elections to take place.  Following December elections, his rival Zoran Zaev's Social Democrats entered a coalition with ethnic Albanian parties to form a government.  Nationalists including VMRO-DPMNE say the coalition deal threatens the sovereignty of Macedonia and allege it could lead to division along ethnic lines if more autonomy is given to ethnic Albanians, who make up a third of the population.    Macedonia's accession into the EU and NATO has been blocked over a name dispute with Greece, which has a northern province called Macedonia and regards Skopje's use of the name as a territorial grab.

Bush,Henry Floyd,John Bailey,Joshua Schopf,Trump,MURRAY ENERGY,EPA/DECISION,Americas,United States","sector":"","content":"(Reuters) - A federal appeals court said the Environmental Protection Agency should not have been ordered by a lower court judge to assess how its air regulations affect coal industry jobs, in a defeat for Murray Energy Corp, a large coal miner. The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia, ruled on Thursday that in passing the Clean Air Act, Congress did not authorize lawsuits such as Murray's, depriving federal courts of jurisdiction to hear them. Murray had accused the EPA, during the Obama administration, of overstepping its authority by imposing regulations without regard for their economic and employment impact. The 3-0 decision was also a defeat for 16 U.S. states, all but one with Republican governors, that supported Murray. Gary Broadbent, a Murray spokesman, said the St. Clairsville, Ohio-based company intends to appeal. Murray had sued the EPA in 2014, citing a Clean Air Act provision directing it to  conduct continuing evaluations of potential loss or shifts of employment  when enforcing its regulations. Chief Executive Bob Murray had been a persistent critic of the Obama administration over what he called its  war on coal.  Last October, U.S. District Judge John Bailey in Wheeling, West Virginia, ordered the EPA to write a report on the jobs impact of coal industry regulations, rejecting its argument that it had discretion to decide when evaluations were needed. But the appeals court said the Clean Air Act did not require the EPA to write such a report.  The agency gets to decide how to collect a broad set of employment impact data, how to judge and examine this extensive data, and how to manage these tasks on an ongoing basis,  Circuit Judge Henry Floyd wrote.  A court is ill-equipped to supervise this continuous, complex process.  EPA spokeswoman Amy Graham said in an email:  President Trump's EPA will take the economic and job impacts of its proposed regulations into account consistent with its statutory requirements, regardless of the outcome of this particular case.  Murray also drew support from the Cause of Action Institute, an advocacy group favoring limited government. Joshua Schopf, a lawyer for the group, in an interview said courts should not  unduly defer to agencies' interpretation of statutory language,  and the 4th Circuit  appeared to engage in verbal gymnastics  by ruling against Murray. Former President Barack Obama appointed the judges on the appeals court panel. Floyd was previously a district court judge appointed by President George W. Bush. The case is Murray Energy Corp et al v. EPA, 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 16-2432.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/murray-energy-epa-decision-idUSL1N1JQ1F8"},

Moller-Maersk (MAERSKb.CO) two days ago, showing the scale of the damage a computer virus can unleash on the technology dependent and inter-connected industry. About 90 percent of world trade is transported by sea, with ships and ports acting as the arteries of the global economy. Ports increasingly rely on communications systems to keep operations running smoothly, and any IT glitches can create major disruptions for complex logistic supply chains. The cyber attack was among the biggest-ever disruptions to hit global shipping. Several port terminals run by a Maersk division, including in the United States, India, Spain, the Netherlands, were still struggling to revert to normal operations on Thursday after experiencing massive disruptions.  South Florida Container Terminal, for example, said dry cargo could not be delivered and no container would be received. Anil Diggikar, chairman of JNPT port, near the Indian commercial hub of Mumbai, told Reuters that he did not know  when exactly the terminal will be running smoothly .  His uncertainty was echoed by Maersk itself, which told Reuters that a number of IT systems were still shut down and that it could not say when normal business operations would be resumed.  It said it was not able to comment on specific questions regarding the breach of its IT systems or the state of its cyber security as it had  all available hands focused on practical stuff and getting things back to normal .  The impact of the attack on the company has reverberated across the industry given its position as the world's biggest container shipping line and also operator of 76 ports via its APM Terminals division.   Container ships transport much of the world's consumer goods and food, while dry bulk ships haul commodities including coal and grain and tankers carry vital oil and gas supplies.  As Maersk is about 18 percent of all container trade, can you imagine the panic this must be causing in the logistic chain of all those cargo owners all over the world?  said Khalid Hashim, managing director of Precious Shipping (PSL.BK), one of Thailand's largest dry cargo ship owners.    Right now none of them know where any of their cargoes (or)containers are. And this 'black hole' of lack of knowledge will continue till Maersk are able to bring back their systems on line.   Back to Basics The computer virus, which researchers are calling GoldenEye or Petya, began its spread on Tuesday in Ukraine and affected companies in dozens of countries. Maersk said the attack had caused outages at its computer systems across the world. In an example of the turmoil that ensued, the unloading of vessels at the group's Tacoma terminal was severely slowed on Tuesday and Wednesday, said Dean McGrath, president of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union Local 23 there. The terminal is a key supply line for the delivery of domestic goods such as milk and groceries and construction materials to Anchorage, Alaska.  They went back to basics and did everything on paper,  McGrath said.     Ong Choo Kiat, President of U-Ming Marine Transport (2606.TW), Taiwan's largest dry bulk ship owner, said the fact Maersk had been affected rang alarm bells for the whole shipping industry as the Danish company was regarded as a leader in IT technology.   But they ended up one of the first few casualties. I therefore conclude that shipping is lacking behind the other industry in term of cyber security,  he said.   How long would it takes to catch up? I don't know. But recently all owners and operators are definitely more aware of the risk of cyber security and beginning to pay more attention to it.   In a leading transport survey by international law firm Norton Rose Fulbright published this week, 87 percent of respondents from the shipping industry believed cyber attacks would increase over the next five years - a level that was higher than counterparts in the aviation, rail and logistics industries.  Vulnerable Apart from the reliance on computer systems, ships themselves are increasingly exposed to interference through electronic navigation devices such as the Global Positioning System (GPS) and lack the backup systems airliners have to prevent crashes, according to cyber security experts. There were no indications that GPS and other electronic navigation aids were affected by this week's attack, but security specialists say such systems are vulnerable to signal loss from deliberate jamming by hackers. Last year, South Korea said hundreds of fishing vessels had returned early to port after its GPS signals were jammed by North Korea, which denied responsibility.  The Maersk attack raises our awareness of the vulnerability of shipping and ports to technological failure,  said Professor David Last, a previous president of Britain's Royal Institute of Navigation.  When GPS fails, ships' captains lose their principal means of navigation and much of their communications and computer links. They have to slow down and miss port schedules,  said Last, who is also a strategic advisor to the General Lighthouse Authorities of the UK and Ireland. A number of countries including the UK and the United States are looking into deploying a radar based back up navigation system for ships called eLoran, but this will take time to develop.  David Nordell, head of strategy and policy for London-based think tank, the Centre for Strategic Cyberspace and Security Science, said the global shipping and port industries were vulnerable to cyber attack, because their operating technologies tend to be old.  It's certainly possible to imagine that two container ships, or, even worse, oil or gas tankers, could be hacked into colliding, resulting in loss of life and cargo, and perhaps total loss of the vessels,  Nordell said.   Carried out in a strategically sensitive location such as the Malacca Straits or the Bosphorus, a collision like this could block shipping for enough time to cause serious dislocations to trade.  Secretive Industry Cyber risks also pose challenges for insurance cover.     In a particularly secretive industry, information about the nature of cyber attacks is still scarce, which insurance and shipping officials say is an obstacle to mitigating the risk, which means there are gaps in insurance cover available.  There has been a lot of non-reporting (of breaches) on ships, and we’re trying efforts where even if there could be anonymous reporting on a platform so we can start to get the information and the data,  said Andrew Kinsey, senior marine consultant at insurer Allianz Global Corporate & Specialty. There is also a gap in provision, because most existing cyber or hull insurance policies - which insure the ship itself - will not cover the risk of a navigation system being jammed or physical damage to the ship caused by a hacking attack.  The industry is just waking up to its vulnerability,  said Colin Gillespie, deputy director of loss prevention with ship insurer North.    Perhaps it is time for insurers, reinsurers, ship operators and port operators to sit down together and consider these risks in detail. A collective response is needed - we are all under attack.

The $188 billion U.S. bank doubled its dividend and boosted its share buyback by $15.6 billion after clearing the exam. Chief Executive Mike Corbat has been understandably laser-focused on returning capital and appeasing watchdogs, objectives that eluded his predecessor and lifted him into the job. Spurring growth to match bigger investor payouts is a trickier challenge. Corbat was brought in as Citi’s chief in 2012, after the bank failed the test for the first time under Vikram Pandit. The bank failed again in 2014, leaving Corbat stunned. With his job at stake, Corbat persuaded an executive to delay retirement and take over the examination process. The bank spent $180 million to improve its systems and streamlined operations.  On Wednesday, for the third straight year, Citi passed. Corbat raised the dividend to 32 cents per share, bringing total payouts to $18.9 billion over the next year. That amounts to 125 percent of projected earnings; analysts expected 110 percent. After sitting on excess capital for several years, Corbat said the results marked a “significant milestone” and the bank can now start delivering on bigger payouts and better returns.   Citigroup's profitability has lagged peers, with a 7.6 percent return on tangible common equity. JPMorgan is at 13 percent. Citi has also been shrinking, pulling out of 20 consumer markets, about half its geographical footprint. It's not clear whether the remaining businesses can produce the kind of profitability that will support higher returns to shareholders.  The bank is investing in areas of growth. For example, Citi announced in 2016 it was acquiring Costco's credit card portfolio from American Express, which could help boost earnings in 2017. Citi also believes it needs an 11.5 percent common equity Tier 1 capital ratio to meet regulatory standards; it now has 12.8 percent. That gives the bank more room to invest and return capital.   Shareholders will hear more about Citi’s plans later this month during its first investor day in nine years. Further unleashing trapped capital could help the bank eventually reach its goal of a 14 percent return on tangible common equity. More difficult will be improving operational performance, boosting market share in its U.S. consumer arm, explaining its aspirations for Mexico and generally articulating where Citi sees itself now that it has graduated from stress-test purdah.

The Permanent Court of Arbitration's decision is final and binding, but Croatia, which withdrew from the proceedings in 2015, said it would ignore the ruling. The court found that Slovenia should have  uninterrupted access  to the sea it shares with Croatia, presiding Judge Gilbert Guillaume said, in the case between the European Union neighbors.  This decision is not legally binding for us in any way and we have no intention to implement it,  Croatian Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic said in a reaction.  We're open for a bilateral dialogue with Slovenia and we do not expect from Slovenia any one-sided action on this issue,  Plenkovic said. Slovenia's government welcomed the ruling, calling it  definitive and legally binding .  Slovenia will continue its good cooperation with Croatia and will not do anything that would aggravate mutual relations,” Slovenian Prime Minister Miro Cerar told a news conference. The countries have been arguing over a stretch of their sea and land border since both declared independence from the former Yugoslavia in 1991 as it disintegrated into war and broke up. The dispute, which centers on the bay of Piran, held up Croatian accession to the EU for many years. Only after both parties agreed to arbitration was Zagreb granted entry to the bloc in 2013.  The court has now ruled that Slovenia gets the vast majority of the Piran bay area recognized as its territorial waters. In addition, the tribunal established a 2.5 nautical-mile wide and some 10 nautical-mile long corridor through Croatian waters to give Slovenia much-coveted direct access to international waters.  The zone shall give freedom of communication to all ships and aircraft, civil and military, of any state for the purpose of access to Slovenia,  the court ruled. Croatia withdrew from the arbitration procedures in 2015 after a leaked tape showed a Slovenian judge on the panel improperly exchanging confidential information with the Ljubljana government. The judge involved resigned and the court decided to continue with the case, saying the incident had not compromised the court's ability to reach a final verdict. It added that rule violations did not allow Croatia to withdraw from the arbitration process.  Slovenia has said Croatia should respect the verdict, while Croatian officials say the row should be resolved bilaterally. The EU has looked to the arbitration between Croatia and Slovenia as a possible blueprint for the way to handle other border disputes that remain between several other Balkan EU-hopefuls.  Croatia's unilateral withdrawal casts doubts on the success of future arbitrations, as well as whether promises made in order to obtain EU accession will be kept once a state has been admitted to the union.

Morocco had recalled its ambassador in the Hague at the weekend over what it described as the Netherlands' failure to  take measures against  Said Chaaou, 50, who it suggested was involved in providing  financial and logistical support  in Morocco's Rif region, the center of months of protests. Chaaou has also been the subject of two arrest warrants accusing him of criminal association and international drug trafficking, issued by a Moroccan court in 2010 and 2015. The Dutch Justice Department confirmed his arrest, after it was first reported by Morocco's MAP state news agency on Thursday, and said it was made under an international arrest warrant related to a 2015 request from Morocco.  It said the arrest had not been carried out before because Morocco had not given the required guarantees to Chaaou as a Dutch citizen. As a Dutch national he needed a guarantee he can serve out any sentence in the Netherlands. The Moroccan foreign ministry said that it would now seek Chaaou's extradition from the Netherlands.  Today's arrest of Said Chaaou, by Dutch authorities, constitutes an important development in the treatment of this affair tied with organized crime and which has lasted years,  it said. The Dutch justice department said a court would review the extradition request, a process that can take up to 18 months. In Morocco's Rif region, a movement called Hirak al Chaabi in Arabic has led demonstrations, accusing officials of corruption and abuses after the death last October of a fishmonger who was crushed in a garbage truck trying to recover fish confiscated by the police. A lawyer defending several leaders of the Hirak currently held in prison previously told Reuters that Chaaou has no ties with the movement, describing reports of Chaaou's funding of Hirak as  rumors.

The Permanent Court of Arbitration's decision is final and binding, but Croatia, which withdrew from the proceedings in 2015, said it would ignore the ruling. The court found that Slovenia should have  uninterrupted access  to the sea it shares with Croatia, presiding Judge Gilbert Guillaume said, in the case between the European Union neighbors.  This decision is not legally binding for us in any way and we have no intention to implement it,  Croatian Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic said in a reaction.  We're open for a bilateral dialogue with Slovenia and we do not expect from Slovenia any one-sided action on this issue,  Plenkovic said. Slovenia's government welcomed the ruling, calling it  definitive and legally binding .  Slovenia will continue its good cooperation with Croatia and will not do anything that would aggravate mutual relations,” Slovenian Prime Minister Miro Cerar told a news conference. The countries have been arguing over a stretch of their sea and land border since both declared independence from the former Yugoslavia in 1991 as it disintegrated into war and broke up. The dispute, which centers on the bay of Piran, held up Croatian accession to the EU for many years. Only after both parties agreed to arbitration was Zagreb granted entry to the bloc in 2013.  The court has now ruled that Slovenia gets the vast majority of the Piran bay area recognized as its territorial waters. In addition, the tribunal established a 2.5 nautical-mile wide and some 10 nautical-mile long corridor through Croatian waters to give Slovenia much-coveted direct access to international waters.  The zone shall give freedom of communication to all ships and aircraft, civil and military, of any state for the purpose of access to Slovenia,  the court ruled. Croatia withdrew from the arbitration procedures in 2015 after a leaked tape showed a Slovenian judge on the panel improperly exchanging confidential information with the Ljubljana government. The judge involved resigned and the court decided to continue with the case, saying the incident had not compromised the court's ability to reach a final verdict. It added that rule violations did not allow Croatia to withdraw from the arbitration process.  Slovenia has said Croatia should respect the verdict, while Croatian officials say the row should be resolved bilaterally. The EU has looked to the arbitration between Croatia and Slovenia as a possible blueprint for the way to handle other border disputes that remain between several other Balkan EU-hopefuls.  Croatia's unilateral withdrawal casts doubts on the success of future arbitrations, as well as whether promises made in order to obtain EU accession will be kept once a state has been admitted to the union.

The review comes amid a flurry of activity in the packaged food sector in which Nestle is being pushed to change by an activist shareholder, Unilever  is selling its margarines business and Reckitt Benckiser is selling its mustard business.  In line with good corporate governance, the group regularly reviews options to deliver value for all its stakeholders,  the company said in a statement on Thursday.  These reviews are carried out in the ordinary course of business as part of the group's standard planning cycle and also on ad hoc bases, and may involve external advisors.  A spokesman for Premier Foods declined to elaborate, but the company's statement was in response to a Wall Street Journal report that said Premier had hired Credit Suisse to review options that could include the sale of one or more brands, a merger with another food group or an outright sale. Credit Suisse has been an adviser to the company for several years. A spokeswoman for the bank declined to comment. Premier said last month it was changing its strategy to give equal focus to revenue growth, cost efficiencies and cash generation. It said on Thursday its board had made no changes to the new strategy. Separately, Hong Kong-based shareholder Oasis Management, which has a representative on Premier's board, said it had raised its stake in the company to 8.84 percent. Its plan is to reach 10 percent by June 2018. Last year, Premier rejected a twice-improved 65 pence-per-share takeover bid from U.S. rival McCormick Foods ,  garnering criticism from major shareholders and leading to a steep drop in its share price. The shares closed on Wednesday at 40 pence apiece.

Trump,John T. Standley,Maureen Ohlhausen,Neil Saunders,RITEAID,MandA/WALGREENS BOOTS (UPDATE 5),Americas,United States","sector":"","content":"(Reuters) - Drugstore chain Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc scrapped its deal to buy Rite Aid Corp after failing to win antitrust approval, but said it would instead buy nearly half of the smaller rival's U.S. stores for $5.18 billion. Rite Aid's shares plunged about 30 percent to $2.77, while Walgreens shares were flat at $76.91 midday. Walgreens also ended a related deal to sell as many as 1,200 Rite Aid stores to Fred's Inc, sending Fred's shares down 19 percent. Walgreens, the biggest U.S. drugstore chain, will likely have an easier time winning antitrust approval to buy 2,186 Rite Aid stores after it failed to win approval to take over the nearly 4,600-store chain.  Walgreens and Rite Aid have taken a pragmatic approach,  said Neil Saunders, managing director of market research firm GlobalData Retail. That said, the decision to sell so many stores will weaken Rite Aid and could still be controversial, said David Balto, an antitrust lawyer who had worked with groups opposing Walgreens’ takeover of Rite Aid.  Rite Aid's future is going to be bleak after they sell these stores. This is still going to raise some serious questions. It's still taking out a major competitor,  Balto said. In fact, Walgreens' plan to buy 2,186 Rite Aid stores accomplishes many of the same goals as the merger - including eliminating Rite Aid as a rival - but does so in a way that makes it harder for the FTC to take the companies to court to stop the transaction, antitrust experts said.  Obviously no victory dance for the FTC today. This was a big stick-it-to-you. They're (the FTC) getting a worse outcome than they would before,  said Andre Barlow of the law firm Doyle, Barlow and Mazard PLLC.  Clearly they (the companies) know what the FTC concerns are. They have likely worked around those issues, which has to be very frustrating for the FTC.  The FTC sued to stop two separate deals last week, suggesting that former administration's tough antitrust approach will continue under President Donald Trump. The agency is being run by Acting Chairwoman Maureen Ohlhausen and three commissioner slots are vacant. The FTC said on Thursday it would review the new proposal. Walgreens to Pay More Per Store Rite Aid said the stores to be sold are mainly in the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic and Southeast. The deal also includes distribution centers in Connecticut, Pennsylvania and South Carolina. Leerink Partners analyst David Larsen estimated that under the new deal, Walgreens would be paying $2.4 million per Rite Aid store, higher than what it would have paid under a previous agreement, where it would have paid $2.04 million to $2.06 million per store. Walgreens said on Thursday it expects the new deal to close within six months. Walgreens also reported better-than-expected profit and sales for the third quarter, helped by a rise in prescription volumes in its U.S. pharmacy business. The company also authorized a $5 billion buyback program and raised the lower end of its full-year profit forecast by 8 cents per share to a range of $4.98 to $5.08. Analysts on average were expecting full-year profit of $4.96 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The new agreement will assist Rite Aid in addressing pharmacy margin challenges and in significantly reducing debt, the company's CEO John Standley said in a statement. Walgreens said it expects the new deal to modestly add to adjusted earnings per share in the first full year after the close and generate savings of more than $400 million.

Citizens of Parachinar began a sit-in protest soon after the two bombs went off last week on Friday evening, as shoppers were out buying supplies in preparation for the breaking of the fast on one of the last days of the holy month of Ramadan. A faction of the Pakistan-based Sunni Muslim militant group Lashkar-e-Jhangvi claimed responsibility for the attack in a town where a large number of members of the Shi'ite Muslim minority live. The crowd, already angry over what they see as the failure of authorities to ensure security, has become more enraged by the shooting dead of three protesters by police trying to keep order. Authorities have not confirmed that three protesters were killed, saying only they were investigating.  We are tired of picking up the dead bodies of our people,  said Arshad Umerzai, a former provincial government minister. Umerzai said the prime minister and army chief should visit Parachinar, which is close to the border with Afghanistan, in response to the violence the town has suffered. Children hold placards on the front line as protesters demonstrate against the lack of security provided to residents of Parachinar during a demonstration in Islamabad, Pakistan June 27, 2017.Caren FirouzPrime Minister Nawaz Sharif announced 1 million rupees ($10,000) compensation for the families of every victim of the blasts, and 500,000 rupees for the wounded, but the protesters dismissed that, saying victims of attacks in other places got more, a witness said. Security forces stopped media crew from traveling into the town to cover the protest on Thursday, saying they needed special permission. Parachinar is part of the Federally Administrated Tribal Areas, ethnic Pashtun-majority areas along the Afghan border covered by special laws and regulations. A former senator, Allama Abid al-Hussaini, said the sit-in, centered in a town park, was estimated to have attracted 70,000 participants on Thursday. A senior government official in the town said tens of thousands joined the protest. Parachinar had already suffered two bomb attacks this year, before last Friday's blasts, that killed about 50 people. Religious leader Allama Fida Mazahiri said the killing of the protesters in police firing was particularly infuriating.  We have sided with the security forces at every turn in fighting terrorism ... but the firing on protesters is uncalled for and action needs to be taken,  Mazahiri said.

The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia,  ruled on Thursday that in passing the Clean Air Act, Congress did not authorize lawsuits such as Murray's, depriving federal courts of jurisdiction to hear them. Murray had accused the EPA, during the Obama administration, of overstepping its authority by imposing regulations without regard for their economic and employment impact. The 3-0 decision was also a defeat for 16 U.S. states, all but one with Republican governors, that supported Murray. Gary Broadbent, a Murray spokesman, said the St. Clairsville, Ohio-based company intends to appeal. Murray had sued the EPA in 2014, citing a Clean Air Act provision directing it to  conduct continuing evaluations of potential loss or shifts of employment  when enforcing its regulations. Chief Executive Bob Murray had been a persistent critic of the Obama administration over what he called its  war on coal.  Last October, U.S. District Judge John Bailey in Wheeling, West Virginia, ordered the EPA to write a report on the jobs impact of coal industry regulations, rejecting its argument that it had discretion to decide when evaluations were needed. But the appeals court said the Clean Air Act did not require the EPA to write such a report.  The agency gets to decide how to collect a broad set of employment impact data, how to judge and examine this extensive data, and how to manage these tasks on an ongoing basis,  Circuit Judge Henry Floyd wrote.  A court is ill-equipped to supervise this continuous, complex process.  EPA spokeswoman Amy Graham said in an email:  President Trump's EPA will take the economic and job impacts of its proposed regulations into account consistent with its statutory requirements, regardless of the outcome of this particular case.  Murray also drew support from the Cause of Action Institute, an advocacy group favoring limited government. Joshua Schopf, a lawyer for the group, in an interview said courts should not  unduly defer to agencies' interpretation of statutory language,  and the 4th Circuit  appeared to engage in verbal gymnastics  by ruling against Murray. Former President Barack Obama appointed the judges on the appeals court panel. Floyd was previously a district court judge appointed by President George W. Bush.

Cyber security firms are trying to piece together who was behind the computer worm, dubbed NotPetya by some experts, which has paralyzed thousands of machines worldwide, shutting down ports, factories and offices as it spread through internal organizational networks to an estimated 60 countries. Ukrainian politicians were quick on Tuesday to blame Russia, but a Kremlin spokesman dismissed  unfounded blanket accusations . Kiev has accused Moscow of two previous cyber strikes on the Ukrainian power grid and other attacks since Russia annexed Crimea in 2014.  A growing consensus among security researchers, armed with technical evidence, suggests the main purpose of the attack was to install new malware on computers at government and commercial organizations in Ukraine. Rather than extortion, the goal may be to plant the seeds of future sabotage, experts said. International firms appear to have been hit through their operations in the country.  Slovakian security software firm ESET released statistics on Thursday showing 75 percent of the infections detected among its global customer base were in Ukraine, and that all of the top 10 countries hit were located in central, eastern or southern Europe. Arne Schoenbohm, president of BSI, Germany's federal cyber security agency, told Reuters in an interview on Thursday that most of the damage from the attack had hit Ukraine, and Russia to a lesser extent, with only a few dozen German firms affected.  In all of the known cases, the companies were first infected through a Ukrainian subsidiary,  the German official said. Smokescreen Ukraine's cyber police said in a statement on Thursday morning that it had received 1,500 requests for help from individuals and companies in connection with the virus. The malicious code in the new virus encrypted data on computers and demanded victims pay a $300 ransom, similar to the extortion tactic used in a global WannaCry ransomware attack in May.  A top Ukrainian police official told Reuters that the extortion demands were likely a smokescreen, echoing working hypotheses from top cyber security firms, who consider NotPetya a  wiper , or tool for destroying data and wiping hard disks clean, that is disguised as ransomware.   Since the virus was modified to encrypt all data and make decryption impossible, the likelihood of it being done to install new malware is high,  the official, who declined to be identified, wrote in a phone text message to Reuters. Information Systems Security Partners (ISSP), a Kiev-based cyber research firm that has investigated previous cyber attacks against Ukraine, is pursuing the same line of inquiry. ISSP said that given that few people actually paid the $300 demanded for removing the virus, money was unlikely to be the primary object of the attack.   It's highly likely that during this attack new attacks were set up,  said ISSP chairman Oleg Derevianko.  At almost all organizations whose network domains were infected, not all computers went offline,  he said by phone.  Why didn't they all go offline? We are trying to understand what they might have left on those machines that weren't hit.  Ukraine's National Security and Defence Council Secretary Oleksandr Turchynov said the virus was first and foremost spread through an update issued by an accounting services and business management software.   Also involved was the hosting service of an internet provider, which the SBU (Ukraine's state security service) has already questioned about cooperation with Russian intelligence agencies,  he said, according to a statement.  Destructive Intent Technical experts familiar with the recent history of the cyber escalation between Russia and Ukraine, say these latest attacks are part of the wider political and military conflict, although no  smoking gun  has been found to identify the culprits. John Hultquist, a cyber intelligence analyst with FireEye, said the failed ransomware attack disguises an as yet unseen destructive motive.  If it were an attack masquerading as crime, that would not be unprecedented at all,  Hultquist said. Some cyber security researchers have said the fact that the Kremlin's two flagship energy companies are victims of the attack could suggest Moscow was not behind it. Russian oil major Rosneft was one of the first companies to reveal it had been compromised by the virus and sources told Reuters on Thursday computers at state gas giant Gazprom had also been infected.  For technical reasons, NotPetya appears to be more targeted than last month's global ransomware attack, known as WannaCry. When first infected by WannaCry, computers scanned the internet globally for other vulnerable machines. By contrast, NotPetya does not randomly scan the Internet to find new computers to infect. It only spreads itself inside organizational networks, taking advantage of a variety of legitimate network administration tools. This makes it far harder for anti-virus software or network security technicians to detect. It also gives it the capacity to infect other Windows computers, even those with the latest security patches, several security firms warned on Thursday.  Petya is proving to be more sophisticated than WannaCry in terms of scope, ability to be neutralized, and apparently, the motivation behind its launch,  corporate security consulting firm Kroll has advised its clients.  So far, NotPetya appears only to have been distributed inside Ukraine via a handful of so-called  watering-hole attacks  - by piggy-backing on the software updating feature of a popular national tax accounting program known as MEDoc. Kaspersky, a global cyber security firm based in Russia, also said they found a second distribution point on a local news site in the city of Bakhmut, Ukraine, which infected visitors who clicked on the site with the ransomware-like attack.  Our analysis indicates the main purpose of the attack was not financial gain, but widespread destruction,  said Costin Raiu, Kaspersky’s global head of research.  NotPetya ..combined elements of a targeted watering hole attack we’ve traditionally seen used by nation states with traditional software exploitation to devastate a specific user base,  Lesley Carhart, a Chicago-based security researcher, wrote in a blog widely shared online by top security experts.

The computer worm was first seen in Ukraine on Tuesday, going on to affect port facilities ranging from Mumbai to Los Angeles. It hit Argentina on Wednesday, slowing wheat and fertilizer shipments and threatening to impact the flow of soybeans to the country's main client, China, at the height of export season.  Cofco's system has been affected by the global attack. It has been infected by a virus. So they are working mechanically, not connected to their regular information system,  Guillermo Wade, head of Argentina's CAPyM port operators' chamber, told Reuters in a telephone interview. A local Cofco representative did not respond to a request for comment. The company's Brazil unit declined to comment.  In 2014 Cofco agreed to buy Dutch grain trader Nidera and the agribusiness of Noble Group for more than $3 billion. The deal propelled Cofco to the No. 2 spot among exporters of Argentine grains, oilseeds and byproducts.  So far we've heard only Nidera and Noble were hit,  said a senior Buenos Aires-based grains trader, who requested anonymity.  One of several ships scheduled to unload fertilizer at a Cofco port facility in Rosario had been halted since Tuesday, Wade said, while a vessel loading wheat produced in the vast Pampas grains belt was interrupted for hours until local operators found a mechanical work-around to the attack.  It is affecting all of Cofco's port operations in Rosario,  Wade added.  The cargo ship that was unloading fertilizer is still stopped. This has caused a backup in the line of other ships that have cargo to unload.  Cofco is one of 43 export and port service companies that belong to the CAPyM chamber. Cofco operates two ports in Rosario. Each has two berths used to load grains, oilseeds and byproducts, as well as unload fertilizers used by growers across the country. Argentina is the world's top exporter of soymeal livestock feed and the No. 3 supplier of raw soybeans, as well as a major global corn supplier. Other major exporters like Archer Daniels Midland Co (ADM.N) have operations in Rosario. The port complex is located on the banks of the Parana River, which leads out to the shipping lanes of the South Atlantic. On Tuesday U.S.-based ADM spokeswoman Jackie Anderson said a small number of the company's computers were impacted by the cyber attack.  We have been able to continue normal business operations and are continuing to monitor the situation,  she said.

The virus is believed to have first taken hold on Tuesday in Ukraine where it silently infected computers after users downloaded a popular tax accounting package or visited a local news site, national police and international cyber experts said. More than a day after it first struck, companies around the world were still wrestling with the fallout while cyber security experts scrambled to find a way to stem the spread. Danish shipping giant A.P. Moller-Maersk (MAERSKb.CO) said it was struggling to process orders and shift cargoes, congesting some of the 76 ports around the world run by its APM Terminals subsidiary. U.S. delivery firm FedEx Corp (FDX.N) said its TNT Express division had been significantly affected by the virus, which also wormed its way into South America, affecting ports in Argentina operated by China's Cofco. The malicious code locked machines and demanded victims post a ransom worth $300 in bitcoins or lose their data entirely, similar to the extortion tactic used in the global WannaCry ransomware attack in May. More than 30 victims paid up but security experts are questioning whether extortion was the goal, given the relatively small sum demanded, or whether the hackers were driven by destructive motives rather than financial gain. Hackers asked victims to notify them by email when ransoms had been paid but German email provider Posteo quickly shut down the address, a German government cyber security official said. Ukraine, the epicenter of the cyber strike, has repeatedly accused Russia of orchestrating attacks on its computer systems and critical power infrastructure since its powerful neighbor annexed the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea in 2014. The Kremlin, which has consistently rejected the accusations, said on Wednesday it had no information about the origin of the global cyber attack, which also struck Russian companies such as oil giant Rosneft (ROSN.MM) and a steelmaker.  No one can effectively combat cyber threats on their own, and, unfortunately, unfounded blanket accusations will not solve this problem,  said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov.

Eternal Blue The aim of the latest attack appeared to be disruption rather than ransom, said Brian Lord, former deputy director of intelligence and cyber operations at Britain's GCHQ and now managing director at private security firm PGI Cyber.  My sense is this starts to look like a state operating through a proxy ... as a kind of experiment to see what happens,  Lord told Reuters on Wednesday. While the malware seemed to be a variant of past campaigns, derived from code known as Eternal Blue believed to have been developed by the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA), experts said it was not as virulent as May's WannaCry attack. Security researchers said Tuesday's virus could leap from computer to computer once unleashed within an organization but, unlike WannaCry, it could not randomly trawl the internet for its next victims, limiting its scope to infect.

MIKHAIL GOLUB via REUTERSBushiness that installed Microsoft's (MSFT.O) latest security patches from earlier this year and turned off Windows file-sharing features appeared to be largely unaffected. There was speculation, however, among some experts that once the new virus had infected one computer it could spread to other machines on the same network, even if those devices had received a security update. After WannaCry, governments, security firms and industrial groups advised businesses and consumers to make sure all their computers were updated with Microsoft (MSFT.O) security patches. Austria's government-backed Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) said  a small number  of international firms appeared to be affected, with tens of thousands of computers taken down. Security firms including Microsoft, Cisco's (CSCO.O) Talos and Symantec (SYMC.O) said they had confirmed some of the initial infections occurred when malware was transmitted to users of a Ukrainian tax software program called MEDoc. Slideshow (11 Images)The supplier of the software, M.E.Doc denied in a post on Facebook that its software was to blame, though Microsoft reiterated its suspicions afterwards.  Microsoft now has evidence that a few active infections of the ransomware initially started from the legitimate MEDoc updater process,  it said in a technical blog post. Russian security firm Kaspersky said a Ukrainian news site for the city of Bakhumut was also hacked and used to distribute the ransomware to visitors, encrypting data on their machines. Corporate Chaos A number of the international firms hit have operations in Ukraine, and the virus is believed to have spread within global corporate networks after gaining traction within the country. Shipping giant A.P. Moller-Maersk (MAERSKb.CO), which handles one in seven containers shipped worldwide, has a logistics unit in Ukraine. Other large firms affected, such as French construction materials company Saint Gobain (SGOB.PA) and Mondelez International Inc (MDLZ.O), which owns chocolate brand Cadbury, also have operations in the country. Maersk was one of the first global firms to be taken down by the cyber attack and its operations at major ports such as Mumbai in India, Rotterdam in the Netherlands and Los Angeles on the U.S. west coast were disrupted. Other companies to succumb included BNP Paribas Real Estate (BNPP.PA), a part of the French bank that provides property and investment management services.  The international cyber attack hit our non-bank subsidiary, Real Estate. The necessary measures have been taken to rapidly contain the attack,  the bank said on Wednesday. Production at the Cadbury factory on the Australian island state of Tasmania ground to a halt late on Tuesday after computer systems went down. Russia's Rosneft, one of the world's biggest crude producers by volume, said on Tuesday its systems had suffered  serious consequences  but oil production had not been affected because it switched to backup systems.

Naser Haj Mansour, a senior SDF official, told Reuters the SDF had taken a decision to confront Turkish forces  if they try to go beyond the known lines  in the areas near Aleppo where the sides exchanged fire on Wednesday.  Certainly there is a big possibility of open and fierce confrontations in this area, particularly given that the SDF is equipped and prepared,  he said.  If it (the Turkish army)attacks we will defend, and if it attacks there will be clashes.   Turkey has recently deployed reinforcements into the area, according to Turkey-backed rebel groups, prompting SDF concern that Ankara is planning to attack nearby areas that are under SDF control. The SDF is an alliance of Kurdish and Arab groups spearheaded by the YPG militia which Turkey views as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has waged a three-decade insurgency in Turkey.  The Turkish military said on Wednesday it had fired artillery at YPG positions south of the town of Azaz in what it said was a response to the YPG's targeting of Turkey-backed rebels. Mansour said the SDF had responded to Turkish shelling.     On Thursday, Turkey's deputy prime minister, Numan Kurtulmus, said it would retaliate against any cross-border gunfire from the YPG and not remain silent in the face of anti-Turkey activities by terrorist groups abroad. Kurtulmus also reiterated Ankara's opposition to the U.S. arming of YPG combatants and said U.S. officials would understand this was the  wrong path . Mansour said an attack on SDF-controlled areas would  do great harm  to the U.S.-backed Raqqa assault by drawing some SDF fighters away from front lines. The SDF launched a long-anticipated assault on Raqqa city earlier this month. Mansour said SDF forces would soon completely besiege the city by closing the last remaining way out from the south.  There is a plan to impose a complete siege, but if this will take a day or two days, I can't say,  he said. Later the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a war monitor, said the SDF had fully encircled the city after closing the militants' last way out from the south. Raqqa is bordered to the south by the River Euphrates. He said that Islamic State fighters were focusing their efforts on defending certain key positions in the city,  meaning they are conducting fierce battles in some strategic positions .  This may be due to a shortage of numbers and ammunition,  he said.

The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia,  ruled on Thursday that in passing the Clean Air Act, Congress did not authorize lawsuits such as Murray's, depriving federal courts of jurisdiction to hear them. Murray had accused the EPA, during the Obama administration, of overstepping its authority by imposing regulations without regard for their economic and employment impact. The 3-0 decision was also a defeat for 16 U.S. states, all but one with Republican governors, that supported Murray. Gary Broadbent, a Murray spokesman, said the St. Clairsville, Ohio-based company intends to appeal. Murray had sued the EPA in 2014, citing a Clean Air Act provision directing it to  conduct continuing evaluations of potential loss or shifts of employment  when enforcing its regulations. Chief Executive Bob Murray had been a persistent critic of the Obama administration over what he called its  war on coal.  Last October, U.S. District Judge John Bailey in Wheeling, West Virginia, ordered the EPA to write a report on the jobs impact of coal industry regulations, rejecting its argument that it had discretion to decide when evaluations were needed. But the appeals court said the Clean Air Act did not require the EPA to write such a report.  The agency gets to decide how to collect a broad set of employment impact data, how to judge and examine this extensive data, and how to manage these tasks on an ongoing basis,  Circuit Judge Henry Floyd wrote.  A court is ill-equipped to supervise this continuous, complex process.  EPA spokeswoman Amy Graham said in an email:  President Trump's EPA will take the economic and job impacts of its proposed regulations into account consistent with its statutory requirements, regardless of the outcome of this particular case.  Murray also drew support from the Cause of Action Institute, an advocacy group favoring limited government. Joshua Schopf, a lawyer for the group, in an interview said courts should not  unduly defer to agencies' interpretation of statutory language,  and the 4th Circuit  appeared to engage in verbal gymnastics  by ruling against Murray. Former President Barack Obama appointed the judges on the appeals court panel. Floyd was previously a district court judge appointed by President George W. Bush. The case is Murray Energy Corp et al v. EPA, 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 16-2432.

Cablevision, a cable TV provider owned by Televisa , said a Mexico City tribunal on Wednesday upheld a previous order to suspend the importation and distribution of the devices.  Cablevision cannot allow the content that it licenses from domestic and foreign companies to be illegally used,  Cablevision spokeswoman Maria Eugenia Zurita told Reuters via email.  We would also like Roku Inc to better supervise the use of its software so that it's not used inappropriately.  Connected to televisions, Roku devices provide access to Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, Starz and other services over the Internet. They and similar products are a major part of a consumer trend away from cable television in recent years. Los Gatos, California-based Roku disagrees with Wednesday's court ruling and will continue legal efforts to ensure it is able to distribute its products in Mexico, General Counsel Steve Kay said in a statement.  Today's decision is not the final word in this complex legal matter, and it is not expected to prevent consumers from purchasing Roku products in Mexico at this time,  Kay said. Hackers in Mexico use messaging app WhatsApp to offer Roku owners illegal access to monthly packages of hundreds of television channels, including Televisa's, HBO, ESPN and others. In some cases, customers make cash transfers at convenience stores and then send the hackers photos of their receipts. A judge last week issued a court order requested by Cablevision to stop the importation and sale of the Roku devices, but Roku then won a suspension. Wednesday's decision overturned that suspension. Following the latest ruling, Roku devices on Thursday were available for purchase on the Mexican websites of Amazon.com , Best Buy and Wal Mart de Mexico. Roku accounted for nearly half of all over-the-top streaming devices in the United States last year, according to market research firm comScore.

The government, which is trying to push an unpopular austerity agenda through Congress, posted a primary budget deficit of 29.371 billion reais ($8.88 billion) in May, compared to 15.478 billion reais in the year-earlier period. Economists in a Reuters poll had expected a deficit of 20 billion reais. The May deficit was the biggest ever recorded for that month.   The deficit in the 12 months through May reached 167.6 billion reais, equivalent to 2.59 percent of gross domestic product. The official target for 2017 is for a deficit of 139 billion reais. Economists are forecasting it will be 142 billion reais, according to a Finance Ministry survey. Treasury Secretary Ana Paula Vescovi told journalists the deficit widened last month mainly due to a decision to service judicial debts ahead of schedule, a move she said would help save between 600 million and 700 million reais this year. She added that measures under discussion, including a farm tax renegotiation, could boost extraordinary revenues by about 15 billion reais this year. President Michel Temer's government, stung by the loss of Brazil's investment-grade rating, has signaled it is ready to raise taxes later this year if needed to hit the budget target as weaker-than-expected economic growth weighs on tax revenues. Brazil is emerging from its worst recession on record.

Israel Radio reported that Olmert would be freed on Sunday after a parole board decided to cut his sentence by a third, a common practice in Israel for prisoners who have not committed violent crimes. The prosecution said it would not appeal the decision.  He was very excited. He was very happy,  Eli Zohar, another Olmert attorney, said of the parole decision.  He hopes very much the prosecution service will not ask to delay his release.  Olmert was found guilty in 2014 of accepting bribes from real estate developers when he was Jerusalem's mayor, before his 2006-09 term as prime minister and head of a centrist political party. The corruption allegations led to Olmert's resignation as prime minister in September 2008. He stayed in office in a caretaker capacity until a February 2009 election brought right-winger Benjamin Netanyahu to power. During his time as Israel's leader, he claimed significant progress in talks with the Palestinians on securing a final peace deal, offering an Israeli withdrawal from much of the occupied West Bank. But no agreement was reached. FILE PHOTO: Former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert speaks to the media after a hearing at the Supreme Court in Jerusalem December 29, 2015.Debbie Hill/Pool/File PhotoA lawyer by profession, Olmert began his political career in the 1970s as a right-wing lawmaker who targeted organized crime in Israel. As prime minister, Olmert waged war against militants in Lebanon in 2006 and the Gaza Strip in 2008. His original six-year sentence - the judge in the case said his corruption offences were tantamount to  treason  - was cut to 18 months on appeal, but another month was later tagged on over obstruction of justice charges. Olmert's term was ultimately lengthened to 27 months after he was convicted in a separate case involving cash payments from a U.S. businessman. Over the past several weeks, Olmert was again in the Israeli headlines after police raided a publishing house over suspicions a memoir he is writing contained security secrets that had not been cleared by the country's military censor. Olmert was taken to hospital last week, complaining of chest pains, Israeli media reports said. He was returned to prison on Tuesday after tests and treatment. Any attempt at a political comeback seems unlikely. A court found that his crimes entailed  moral turpitude , which under Israeli law would preclude Olmert from running for public office for seven years after his release, when he will be 78.

In a joint statement, 29 nonprofit groups said that any move to deny girls the opportunity to go back to school after giving birth would only punish them, their children - and the nation. “Our motivation is the girls themselves, their quality of life and the opportunities they have to progress. Women and girls make up 51 percent of the population so the question of what happens to them and their children is one that affects all of us,” the group said.  Educating young girls brings economic and social benefits to the whole country.” Last week, President John Magufuli said that schoolgirls who got pregnant would never be re-admitted to school after giving birth, and appeared to mock the young mothers for multitasking.  After calculating some few mathematics, she'd be asking the teacher in the classroom ‘let me go out and breastfeed my crying baby,'  he said. His home affairs minister has also warned activists to stop campaigning for the pregnant girls or risk deregistration. Tanzania has one of the highest adolescent pregnancy and birth rates in the world. According to a 2015/16 survey conducted by the Tanzania Bureau of Statistics, 21 percent of girls aged 15 to 19 have given birth. Challenges Advocates say schoolgirls already face multiple challenges to get an education, be it overcoming the crush of poverty, gender-based violence or long travel distances to school. And many of the girls who become pregnant do so after rape, sexual violence or coercion, said Christa Stewart, program manager at the global girls' charity Equality Now. “When education is universally recognized as the linchpin to success, allowing this violence to continue, and punishing girls who have become pregnant as a result, is a policy doomed to failure.” She told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by email.  More than 55,000 schoolgirls have been expelled from school over the last decade for being pregnant, the U.S.-based Center for Reproductive Rights (CRR) said in a recent report. While some wealthier families can send their daughters to private schools, most expelled girls end up doing casual work. No Turning Back Zainab Kyejo hauls shards of gravel into piles to sell and make some sort of a living, working under blistering sun with a 2-year-old strapped to her back. “This is what I do to get something to feed my baby. I got pregnant and expelled from school,  she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in an interview. “I still don’t know how to prevent myself from getting pregnant.” It is a world away from her old life at Zinga secondary school from which she was expelled in 2015. Now the 19-year-old spends hours crushing stones at Kunduchi quarry in a Dar es Salaam suburb - knowing it is too late to turn back. ”I have learned a bitter lesson, I wish I could go back to school,” she said.  “I don’t like crushing stones, but what else can I do?” Underage sex is criminalized in Tanzania, with convicts facing up to 30 years in prison. In April this year a court in the northern Kilimanjaro region sentenced 22-year-old Daudi Maulidi to a 30-year jail term and five strokes for impregnating a 16-year-old student. But it is girls who most often pay the heaviest price for underage sex, and teachers say they deserve a second chance if the country is to prosper. “ If young mothers are not educated, they are not likely to  fully engage in income-generating activities,  said Adelvina Magayane, a teacher at Ununio primary school.

Benchmark government note yields, however, jumped to their highest level in more than a month on Thursday in a global bond market selloff, prompted by concerns the era of easy money might be drawing to close following hawkish rhetoric from several major central banks.      Mortgage rates may increase in next week's survey if Treasury yields continue to rise,  Freddie Mac chief economist Sean Becketti said in a statement.

Last week, the average 30-year rate was 3.90 percent, the mortgage finance agency said.     On Thursday, 10-year Treasury yield touched 2.297 percent, matching the level last seen on May 24.

The pan-European STOXX 600 index ended 1.3 percent lower, extending falls just before the U.S. market open, while European blue chips fell 1.8 percent. Signals that central bankers are becoming more hawkish sent bond yields rising, which weighed on defensive, dividend-paying sectors including Europe's personal and household goods sector , health care and food and beverages, which were all down 2 percent or more. Utilities were also down 1.8 percent, led lower by Germany's RWE and Uniper, which both fell around 3 percent. These sectors suffer as growing expectations of rate hikes make their constant dividend flows less attractive.  The fact is that rising rates put at risk the global carry trade and fuel volatility,  said Giuseppe Sersale, fund manager at Anthilia Capital in Milan. On Tuesday European Central Bank President Mario Draghi indicated that the central bank could begin to tighten monetary policy, though sources said on Wednesday that Draghi had been overinterpreted by markets. Likewise Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said on Wednesday that a rise in British interest rates is likely to be needed as the economy comes closer to running at full capacity. Receding political risks, an improving economy and a rebound in corporate earnings have fuelled investor appetite for the bloc's equities, with European shares seen racking up double digit gains this year, according to a Reuters poll of investors. However, Europe's new-found popularity means that any pullback can hit its stocks particularly hard.  Europe is more at risk because it's the consensus trade while positioning on Wall Street is more balanced,  Anthilia Capital's Sersale added. A potential turn towards a tightening in policy has also seen investors begin to favour cyclical stocks once more, with broker UBS downgrading European utilities, saying that valuations of cyclicals looked more attractive again. Only two sectors, banks and basic resources made any gains, up 0.5 percent and 0.4 percent respectively. Banks rose for a fourth straight session after the U.S. Federal Reserve cleared capital return plans from big banks. Among banks given the Fed green light were also U.S. units of Deutsche Bank, HSBC and Santander . The Germany heavyweight lender was also supported by news that a U.S. federal judge dismissed a lawsuit accusing it of concealing major deficiencies in its anti-money laundering controls as part of a $10 billion Russian trading scheme. HSBC, which hit a 4-year high, was also upgraded to  overweight  by Morgan Stanley which forecasts the bank to have $45 billion in excess capital by 2019.  We expect the narrative on HSBC to flip from prior concerns on the dividend to a debate on how to deploy excess capital,  Morgan Stanley said.

Tech stocks, which have led the S&P; 500's record run this year, pulled back recently after some investors questioned the sector's high valuations and shifted to defensive sectors. The S&P; tech index led the laggards among the 11 sectors, with the index on track to post its biggest monthly loss in a year. Apple, which fell 1.8 percent, was the biggest drag on all the three major indexes, while Alphabet, Microsoft and Amazon were among the top three drags on the Nasdaq and the S&P.; The CBOE Volatility index, or Wall Street's  fear gauge , hit more than a one-month high of 12.38 points. The financial sector, which rose as much as 2.02 percent, before paring gains to trade up 0.31 percent, was one of the only two gainers. Shares of the top six U.S. banks rose after the Federal Reserve cleared them in the second part of its annual stress test, allowing them to raise dividend payouts and share buybacks.  Part of the reason why tech is down today is the steam in the recent rotation out of some of big tech winners and into banks,  said Michael Scanlon, portfolio manager at Manulife Asset Management in Boston.  The catalyst for that rotation today is the really strong stress test results coupled with higher treasury rates this morning and a positive GDP revision, leading investors to move into financial which has underperformed this year.  The financial index has grown about 6 percent this year, underperforming the 8.1 percent rise in the S&P.; At 12:41 P.m. ET (1641 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 166.04 points, or 0.77 percent, at 21,288.57, the S&P; 500 was down 21.49 points, or 0.88 percent, at 2,419.2. The Nasdaq Composite index was down 100.77 points, or 1.62 percent, at 6,133.65, on track to post a monthly loss after seven straight months of gains. Earlier in the day, data showed the U.S. economy slowed less sharply in the first quarter than initially estimated due to unexpectedly higher consumer spending and a bigger jump in exports. Oil prices rose to a two-week high, extending the rally into the sixth straight session, after a decline in weekly U.S. production eased concerns about deepening oversupply, helping the energy sector post a gain of 0.38 percent. Among stocks, Rite Aid slumped as much as 30 percent to a near four-year low after Walgreens Boots Alliance terminated its agreement to buy the drug store chain and said it would instead buy nearly half of its stores for $5.18 billion. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 2,156 to 714. On the Nasdaq, 2,007 issues fell and 786 advanced.

Rodon struggled with command in Chicago's 12-3 loss to the New York Yankees, allowing six walks. He gave up three unearned runs in five innings and struck out two.

Andujar, 22, made his major league debut as New York's DH and went 3-for-4 with four RBIs. Andujar hit .308 with Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, after being promoted from Double-A Trenton on June 19. INF Tyler Austin will undergo an MRI on his right hamstring Thursday and might be facing a stint on the 10-day disabled list. After being relegated to DH duties Tuesday because of his mobility, Austin missed the Yankees' game Wednesday at the Chicago White Sox. Austin is day-to-day.

Chase Utley started at first base. SS Corey Seager ran and took batting practice Wednesday to test his sore right hamstring. Seager hurt his hamstring last Friday, but the Dodgers decided against putting him on the disabled list, believing he could return within 10 days. If there are no setbacks, Seager could return to the lineup in the next couple of days. LHP Hyun-Jin Ryu held the Angels scoreless through five innings, then gave up a two-run homer to SS Andrelton Simmons in the sixth. He didn't make it out of the sixth, giving up two runs on seven hits and one walk in 5 2/3 innings, striking out eight. Ryu managed to stay in the game after getting hit on the left foot by a Simmons line drive in the fourth inning.  It's sore,  Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said of Ryu's foot.

He took batting practice with the Diamondbacks before their Wednesday night game against St. Louis. He might be able to rejoin the team next week if he doesn't experience any setbacks. He was hitting .241 with eight homers and 22 RBIs when he last played June 2. INF Ketel Marte, who leads the minor leagues with 105 hits while batting .338 with 36 extra-base hits for Triple-A Reno, was recalled Wednesday from the PCL team to replace injured INF Nick Ahmed. Marte, 23, had six homers, 23 doubles, seven triples and a .381 average with runners in scoring position. The Diamondbacks acquired him with RHP Taijuan Walker in a November trade with Seattle. Manager Torey Lovullo likes that he's a switch hitter, which means he'll likely be used as a pinch-hitter in late-inning situations if he doesn't start.  It's going to be a great luxury,  Lovullo said.  If I need to go get a pinch-hitter, it's going to be a simple thought. I don't need to find if there's a better matchup. It's going to fall right in his lap. (That's a) lot of value to have.  RHP J.J. Hoover, who is about midway through his recovery from an inflamed right shoulder, is progressing as expected, according to Diamondbacks manager Torey Lovullo.  All things are moving in a very positive direction for him and his maintenance program,  Lovullo said.  He's right in the middle of it.  SS Nick Ahmed is expected to be out for six to eight weeks with a broken right hand that required three pins to be inserted Wednesday. He was placed on the disabled list. Ahmed's injury, which occurred when he was hit by a pitch from St. Louis RHP Trevor Rosenthal during a 6-5, 10-inning Arizona win over the Cardinals on Tuesday, is a setback for a team that has been the majors' hottest for more than a month. Ahmed was hitting .251 with six homers and 21 RBIs.  Everybody's bummed about it,  manager Torey Lovullo said. RHP Fernando Rodney struggled in his first month with the Diamondbacks, giving up two runs or more in four of his first 11 games. Since then, he has been difficult to hit. His one scoreless inning Tuesday against the Cardinals gave him a streak of 10 consecutive outings without a hit allowed and 18 consecutive games without a run surrendered. During that streak, batters are hitting .038 (2-for-52) against him. Despite Rodney's uneven April, manager Torey Lovullo said it was easy to stay with the 40-year-old as his closer, and not just because of his 281 career saves.  (He's)  done it a long time and had a high level of success,  Lovullo said.  He's a pretty special character. He's nothing like you think from the other side (the opposing dugout). He's charismatic, he's caring, he believes in and trusts his teammates. He's a great teacher and everybody gravitates toward him.

A month later, he was placed on the 10-day disabled list with a right calf strain. Brewers manager Craig Counsell plans to continue using Peralta in relief when he's healthy.  That's what we're shooting for,  Counsell said.  When he gets to the point of being able to rehab, he will pitch out of the bullpen. That's still what we're planning.  RHP Chase Anderson left Wednesday night's game in Cincinnati after pitching one inning. Anderson appeared to grab his left side after striking out to end the second. The injury was defined as a strained left oblique.  Anytime you lose one of your five starters, it's a big blow,  Brewers manager Craig Counsell said.  We're probably going to lose him for a pretty good bit of time here. The guy's pitching very, very well and we'll have to cover in his absence. It's going to be difficult.  Coming into Wednesday's outing, Anderson was 11-3 with a 2.87 ERA in his previous 27 starts dating to last July. Counsell said the key for Anderson is renewed confidence in his curve ball and the cutter. Anderson is 6-2 with a 2.89 ERA in 16 starts this season, helping Milwaukee spend 39 days alone in first place in the National League Central.

Cozart is leading National League shortstops in the latest All-Star voting and continued to progress in his baseball activity.  He's not as close as we'd like him to be,   Reds manager Bryan Price said.  We think the next 24 to 48 hours.  When he went on the DL, Cozart led all shortstops in batting average, hits, triples, homers, and RBIs.

Manager Joe Maddon said after the game Wednesday that Russell could start Thursday since 3B Kris Bryant left the game in the fifth inning with a mid-to-mild right ankle sprain. The Cubs could use Russell on the infield at SS with Bryant out. 3B/OF Kris Bryant left the game in the fifth when he stepped on third while catching a foul pop.

Manager Joe Maddon said Bryant will not play in the series finale Thursday and  obviously  will stay off his feet a few days.  I was watching closely. It was more painful than you would think,  Maddon said.  I wanted to get him off the field quickly and get it iced as quickly as possible.  Bryant was 2-for-3 off Stephen Strasburg before he left the game. C Victor Caratini was called up from Triple-A Iowa to take the place of C Miguel Montero, who was designated for assignment. Caratini spent all of last year at Double-A Tennessee. He was retired on a grounder as a pinch hitter in the ninth Wednesday in his first big league at-bat. RHP John Lackey gave up a season-high eight runs in the loss Wednesday. The losing pitcher was Lackey, who has a 5.24 ERA.  I think it was a matter of location and lack of execution,  manager Joe Maddon said. LHP Jon Lester will pitch the series finale Thursday at Washington. He is 5-4 with a 3.83 ERA this year. Lester has made four starts in his career against the Nationals and they have all been quality ones. He last faced Washington in 2015 at Wrigley Field and took the loss despite allowing only one earned run in seven innings with 10 strikeouts. C Miguel Montero was designated for assignment Wednesday, one day after he blasted RHP Jake Arrieta for not holding runners on after the Nationals stole seven bases Tuesday.

Alex was on the edge early,  Angels manager Mike Scioscia said.  He struggled. That was an extreme effort for him to get through six innings. He made some big pitches to get out of a couple innings early, but he found his release point and finished strong through the sixth and gave us a chance to win. It's all you can ask for.  RHP Matt Shoemaker, out since June 15 with a strained right forearm, played catch Wednesday and is expected to throw a bullpen session in the next couple of days. If all goes well, he could return to the rotation by Sunday to face Seattle. RHP Bud Norris, out since June 20 with inflammation in his right knee, is scheduled to throw one inning on a rehab assignment for Class A Inland Empire on Thursday. Norris assumed the closer's role in April and had 11 saves with a 2.34 ERA in 34 games before hurting his knee. It is possible he could return to the major league roster this weekend.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-angels-playerwatch-idUSMTZED6TBJ9P3F"},

Hicks was batting .299 with three home runs and 12 RBIs. Hicks was called up from the Mud Hens when designated hitter Victor Martinez was placed on the 10-day disabled list in mid-June. There was no role for Hicks upon Martinez's return, as the team opted not to keep three catchers. Miguel Cabrera is entreched at first base in the other position that Hicks plays. RHP Warwick Saupold was one of the few bright spots in an 8-2 loss to Kansas City on Wednesday. Replacing an ineffective Daniel Norris, Saupold tossed 4 1/3 innings to keep the rest of the bullpen from getting overtaxed during a busy week. He allowed one run on three hits. The run was the first he's given up in his last six outings over 9 2/3 innings. Saupold's performance solidifies his role as the team's main long reliever. 1B Miguel Cabrera remained in the cleanup spot for the second straight game and also homered for the second consecutive night. He ripped a solo blast off Kansas City starter Ian Kennedy for one of the team's two runs. Cabrera finally reached double digits in homers, making him the fourth Tiger this season with at least 10 long balls. All but three of Cabrera's homers have gone to the opposite field. He's also fourth on the team in slugging percentage a .454. DH Victor Martinez was activated from the 10-day disabled list Wednesday but was in a different spot in the batting order. Manager Brad Ausmus dropped Martinez into the No. 6 spot and left Miguel Cabrera in the cleanup spot for the second straight game. Martinez, who was sidelined because of an irregular heartbeat, went 1-for-4. The batting order switch could last for awhile as Ausmus was heavily criticized prior to Martinez's DL stint for keeping the veteran in the No. 4 spot despite the presence of power hitters Justin Upton and J.D. Martinez. RHP Justin Verlander has 23 career victories over Kansas City, including the team's 5-3 victory Tuesday. That's the most wins by any pitcher against any opponent over the last 12 seasons. He's also the first pitcher to give up five consecutive hits at the start of a game and record the victory since Edwin Jackson did it in 2008 for the Tampa Bay Rays. Verlander did not allow another run in his seven-inning stint after the slow start.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-tigers-playerwatch-idUSMTZED6TBJ9P3C"},

It's the first time in 16 starts this season that Bauer has pitched six or more innings and allowed one or fewer runs. Bauer has made 19 such starts in his career, and he is 12-0 in those games.

Trump,Ted Wieseman,US,USA,ECONOMY,Inventories,Inflation,Picture available,Economic Indicators,Consumer Credit,Economic Events,Economic Output,Major News,Graphics,US Government News,Reports,Economic News (3rd Party),United States","sector":"Markets","content":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. economy slowed less than feared in the first quarter  due largely to a jump in consumer spending, providing a slightly more encouraging outlook for growth this year. Gross domestic product increased at a 1.4 percent annual rate instead of the 1.2 percent reported last month, the Commerce Department said in its final assessment for the period on Thursday. The reading was the worst since the second quarter of 2016 but above analysts' expectations, easing fears the economy had been hobbled at the start of this year. The government had pegged first-quarter growth at a paltry 0.7 percent in its first estimate in April.  The upward revision occurred even with a downward revision to the inventory data, which has favorable implications for the adding up of second-quarter growth,  said Daniel Silver, an economist at J.P. Morgan. Economists polled by Reuters had expected GDP growth to be unrevised at 1.2 percent in the first quarter. The economy tends to underperform in that period relative to the rest of the year due to perennial issues with the calculation of the data. The government has said it is working to resolve those issues. The U.S. dollar .DXY briefly edged up after the release of the data before retracing earlier losses against a basket of currencies. Prices of U.S. Treasuries were trading lower and stocks on Wall Street were down sharply. First-quarter economic growth was boosted by an upward revision to consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. Consumer spending rose at a 1.1 percent pace, the weakest reading since the second quarter of 2013 but almost double the 0.6 percent reported last month. Despite the upward revision to GDP, the Trump administration's stated target of swiftly boosting annual U.S. economic growth to 3 percent remains a challenge. A sustained average growth rate of 3 percent has not been achieved in the United States since the 1990s. The U.S. economy has grown an average 2 percent since 2000 and it expanded only 1.6 percent in 2016, which was the weakest growth in five years. President Donald Trump's economic program of tax cuts, regulatory rollbacks and infrastructure spending has yet to get off the ground five months into his presidency. FILE PHOTO: A customer exits after shopping at a Macy's store in the Brooklyn borough of New York, U.S., on May 11, 2017.Brendan McDermid/File PhotoDetails of the White House's tax plan remain sparse as Trump advisers attempt to win over fiscally conservative Republicans in Congress who want any changes to ultimately be revenue-neutral.  Initial signs that economic growth re-accelerated sharply in the second quarter have also faltered in the face of recent disappointing data on retail sales, manufacturing production and inflation. Housing data has also been mixed. The Atlanta Federal Reserve is currently forecasting annualized growth of 2.9 percent in the second quarter. Labor Market Still Strong Other data on Thursday showed the job market was still flashing a green light. The Labor Department reported that the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits last week rose slightly, but the underlying trend remained consistent with a tight labor market. The unemployment rate fell to a 16-year low in May.  U.S. exporters also flexed more muscle in the first quarter. Exports for the period were revised to show a 7.0 percent rate of growth from the previously reported 5.8 percent. Exports in the fourth quarter fell at a rate of 4.5 percent. Business spending on equipment was revised to show it increasing at a rate of 7.8 percent in the January-March period rather than the 7.2 percent previously estimated. Businesses accumulated inventories at a rate of $2.6 billion in the first quarter, rather than the $4.3 billion reported last month. Inventory investment rose at a rate of $49.6 billion in the fourth quarter of last year. Inventories subtracted 1.11 percentage point from GDP growth in the first quarter instead of the 1.07 percentage point previously reported. The government also reported that corporate profits after tax with inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustments fell at an annual rate of 2.7 percent in the first quarter after rising at a 2.3 percent pace in the prior three months.

Premium channels like CBS Corp's Showtime have done this for years to entice new subscribers, but cable networks have not, fearing they might cannibalize TV ratings. But today viewers have many more choices as streaming companies like Amazon.com Inc and Netflix Inc bring a year-round slate of new shows on top of broadcast television. As a result, networks need to do more to promote new shows, according to Dave Morgan, head of advertising technology company Simulmedia. Previously, networks focused all marketing around a show's premier, said Kevin Reilly, chief creative officer at Turner.  Today, the entire first season is a marketing vehicle,  he said. “If I said that five years ago, people would have said 'You're out of your mind'.  Over the past year, Turner put five premiers on Facebook and Google's YouTube. Discovery's true crime channel, Investigation Discovery (ID), plans to put the first episode of at least five of its series on its app for cable subscribers before they air on TV, said Kevin Bennett, general manager of ID. When college football season starts in August, Walt Disney Co's sports network ESPN, which is struggling with declining subscribers, will let online viewers watch 10 minutes of any game or show for free on its app. After 10 minutes, they will have to verify they are a cable subscriber or sign up, Justin Connolly, executive vice president, affiliate sales and marketing at ESPN, told Reuters. Early Success? By putting some episodes online for free, Turner faces the added risk of upsetting its cable and satellite partners. Aware of that, Turner has only selected certain shows to put online. Last June, Turner's TNT got about 6 million viewers for the first episode of its new family crime drama,  Animal Kingdom,  which it streamed on Facebook and YouTube before it aired on TV. Turner said 16 percent of those online viewers - or about 960,000 people - came back to watch the show on TV. Turner believes that putting the premier online helped the show to increase its share of younger viewers, between 18 and 49 years old, from 899,000 at the show's television debut to 1.15 million by the final episode.  It might not build Nielsen ratings, but it builds engagement,  said Michael Engleman, executive vice president of entertainment marketing at Turner, referring to the TV industry's leading ratings firm. ID has put the second episodes of some shows on its Discovery GO app for cable subscribers immediately after the first episodes aired on TV in a bid to drive people to its app and to create a buzz, Bennett said. Last Spring, Discovery streamed the second episode of its miniseries about Casey Anthony, the Florida mom acquitted of killing her two-year-old daughter, right after the first episode aired on TV. When the episode aired on TV the next night, it was the highest-rated second episode for ID ever on TV, Bennett said. For Discovery, whether viewers watch its shows on its app or on TV is not a key distinction. Discovery gets a 50-percent premium on ads sold through the app since they are more targeted and viewers cannot skip ads, said Paul Guyardo, chief commercial officer at Discovery. Such tactics can help when Discovery begins negotiations with its pay TV partners, he said.  When we come up for renewals, we aren't just providing a linear channel,  Guyardo said.  That helps with renewals and rate increases.  Reporting by Jessica Toonkel; editing by Anna Driver and Bill Rigby","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/television-internet-idUSL1N1JG0ZG"},

The committee, made up of British and EU representatives, would ensure the good functioning of the withdrawal agreement, deal with unforeseen situations and discuss diverging views. The documents, published on the European Commission's website, said, however, that when it came to citizens' rights and the continued application of EU law in Britain, the Brexit deal should establish a separate regime. They said they would like Britain to give the European Commission full powers to monitor the implementation of the agreement on EU citizens' rights in Britain after Brexit and the European Court of Justice (ECJ) to have jurisdiction over cases involving citizens' rights after Brexit. This may be very hard to accept in London, which wants to end the ECJ jurisdiction over Britain when the country leaves the EU at the end of March 2019. EU negotiators want the joint committee with Britain to be able to settle disputes about the implementation of the divorce agreement, brought in by either side, but if the committee is unable to find a solution, the EU would like the dispute to be settled by the ECJ. Cases and administrative proceedings that are in motion at the time of Britain's exit would continue to be handled by EU institutions and authorities as well as the ECJ, the documents said, as well as cases brought to the ECJ or EU authorities after Brexit, but concerning events that took place while Britain was still a member of the bloc. This meant that state aid or supervision proceedings that are pending on Britain's withdrawal date would continue to be processed and should be enforced. The negotiating position documents also said that EU institutions and employees with  residual  continuation of activities in Britain after Brexit should enjoy the same level of protection as under current rules.  This covers borrowing, financing and treasury operations of the European Investment Bank in the United Kingdom and with United Kingdom counterparts,  one of the documents said. The documents said both Britain and the EU should be able to use police information obtained from each other before Brexit, confidential and classified information should retain that status. All deals signed between British and EU entities before Brexit, therefore governed by EU laws, should remain under EU laws after London leaves. Finally, British and EU goods available on the market on the day Britain leaves should still be allowed to sell normally if they comply with EU laws on that day.

Trump,Ted Wieseman,US,USA,ECONOMY,Inventories,Inflation,Picture available,Economic Indicators,Consumer Credit,Economic Events,Economic Output,Major News,Graphics,US Government News,Reports,Economic News (3rd Party),United States","sector":"Markets","content":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. economy slowed less than feared in the first quarter  due largely to a jump in consumer spending, providing a slightly more encouraging outlook for growth this year. Gross domestic product increased at a 1.4 percent annual rate instead of the 1.2 percent reported last month, the Commerce Department said in its final assessment for the period on Thursday. The reading was the worst since the second quarter of 2016 but above analysts' expectations, easing fears the economy had been hobbled at the start of this year. The government had pegged first-quarter growth at a paltry 0.7 percent in its first estimate in April.  The upward revision occurred even with a downward revision to the inventory data, which has favorable implications for the adding up of second-quarter growth,  said Daniel Silver, an economist at J.P. Morgan. Economists polled by Reuters had expected GDP growth to be unrevised at 1.2 percent in the first quarter. The economy tends to underperform in that period relative to the rest of the year due to perennial issues with the calculation of the data. The government has said it is working to resolve those issues. The U.S. dollar .DXY briefly edged up after the release of the data before retracing earlier losses against a basket of currencies. Prices of U.S. Treasuries were trading lower and stocks on Wall Street were down sharply. First-quarter economic growth was boosted by an upward revision to consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. Consumer spending rose at a 1.1 percent pace, the weakest reading since the second quarter of 2013 but almost double the 0.6 percent reported last month. Despite the upward revision to GDP, the Trump administration's stated target of swiftly boosting annual U.S. economic growth to 3 percent remains a challenge. A sustained average growth rate of 3 percent has not been achieved in the United States since the 1990s. The U.S. economy has grown an average 2 percent since 2000 and it expanded only 1.6 percent in 2016, which was the weakest growth in five years. President Donald Trump's economic program of tax cuts, regulatory rollbacks and infrastructure spending has yet to get off the ground five months into his presidency.

Initial signs that economic growth re-accelerated sharply in the second quarter have also faltered in the face of recent disappointing data on retail sales, manufacturing production and inflation. Housing data has also been mixed. The Atlanta Federal Reserve is currently forecasting annualized growth of 2.9 percent in the second quarter. Labor Market Still Strong Other data on Thursday showed the job market was still flashing a green light. The Labor Department reported that the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits last week rose slightly, but the underlying trend remained consistent with a tight labor market. The unemployment rate fell to a 16-year low in May.  U.S. exporters also flexed more muscle in the first quarter. Exports for the period were revised to show a 7.0 percent rate of growth from the previously reported 5.8 percent. Exports in the fourth quarter fell at a rate of 4.5 percent. Business spending on equipment was revised to show it increasing at a rate of 7.8 percent in the January-March period rather than the 7.2 percent previously estimated. Businesses accumulated inventories at a rate of $2.6 billion in the first quarter, rather than the $4.3 billion reported last month. Inventory investment rose at a rate of $49.6 billion in the fourth quarter of last year. Inventories subtracted 1.11 percentage point from GDP growth in the first quarter instead of the 1.07 percentage point previously reported. The government also reported that corporate profits after tax with inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustments fell at an annual rate of 2.7 percent in the first quarter after rising at a 2.3 percent pace in the prior three months.

Britain's main share index ended 0.5 percent lower, having spent much of the session in positive territory, while euro zone stocks fell 1.7 percent. British banks, a sector which would benefit from higher rates, jumped 2.7 percent to a four-month high after the U.S. regulator approved higher dividends and buybacks, sending a ripple effect across financial stocks worldwide. The Fed approved plans from the 34 largest U.S. banks, including U.S. units of HSBC and Deutsche Bank, to use extra capital for stock buybacks and other purposes beyond a cushion against possible catastrophe. HSBC was up more than 4 percent to a near four-year high, also boosted by a Morgan Stanley upgrade to 'overweight'. Analysts said they saw capital return rising up the agenda for the bank, with around $45 billion of surplus by 2019.  Our work suggests HSBC will be in the top quartile of EU banks for cash returns over the next three years,  said Morgan Stanley analysts.  HSBC's weighting towards Asia sets it apart from everything else that's listed here. I can see why there's potential for a split where people start looking at HSBC instead of Lloyds, who are far more exposed to Brexit risks,  said Gareth Burchell, partner at Shard Capital.  HSBC pays a very high dividend which is also attractive.  Miners Rio Tinto, Glencore, Antofagasta and Anglo American also lent support as copper and gold prices climbed against the weaker dollar. Shares in broadcaster Sky rose 3.3 percent after the UK government said that it intended to subject Rupert Murdoch's takeover of the group to an in-depth investigation after finding the $15 billion deal risked giving the media mogul too much power over the news agenda. Sky's shares rose on hopes a full investigation could still be averted by concessions over its 24-hour TV news channel. While the sell-off was broad-based, consumer staples were the biggest weight, with British American Tobacco, Unilever, Reckitt Benckiser and Diageo coming under pressure following more hawkish signals from central banks, including the Bank of England on Wednesday. The dividends of such interest-rate sensitive stocks look less attractive when rates are expected to rise. Mid-caps also saw some robust company moves, with hefty losses from JD Sports sending the index down 0.7 percent. Packaging company DS Smith jumped 8.4 percent, hitting an all-time high after reporting upbeat full-year results and a planned $920 million acquisition of 80 percent of U.S. corrugated packaging firm Interstate Resources. JD Sports sank 8.5 percent, its worst day in a year, after a trading update showed sales growth in line with expectations.

The strike by BA's mixed fleet cabin crew - those who work on both long and short-haul flights - is due to begin on Saturday. BA had already applied to Britain's Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) to use nine Qatar-registered Airbus A320 or A321s between July 1 and July 16 and Walsh, CEO of International Consolidated Airlines Group (IAG), said the plan would go ahead.  I'll be pleased to say that those airplanes will fly and all of the British Airways passengers who are booked to fly with us over the next couple of weeks will be flying,  Walsh told reporters in Brussels on Thursday when asked if the application to use the planes had been successful. Members of the mixed fleet crew are engaged in a long-running dispute with BA about pay. The forthcoming strike is over sanctions on union members involved in previous industrial action. British Airways had previously guaranteed that all customers would reach their destinations, although some flights will be merged. The CAA would not confirm that BA's application had been approved and said it was still processing it.  Under European regulations specific approval is required for an EU airline, such as British Airways, to wet lease aircraft from an airline based outside of Europe,  a spokesman for the CAA said in a statement.  The UK Department for Transport will approve or reject the application taking into account advice from the Civil Aviation Authority.  A  wet-leasing  deal would mean that BA pays Qatar to use its aircraft and crew for the two-week period. The deal could help Qatar make more use of its planes after its operations were disrupted by a boycott from four Arab nations, forcing it to seek out other destinations on which to use its planes. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut ties with Qatar on June 5 in the worst diplomatic crisis in the region in years. BA and Qatar Airways have close ties. Both are partners in the OneWorld alliance and code share on certain flights, while the Doha-based carrier owns a 20 percent stake in BA parent International Airlines Group.

Arne Schoenbohm, president of the BSI cyber agency, declined to say exactly how many German firms were affected, but said it was a  low two-digit number , and all the known cases thus far were infected through a Ukrainian subsidiary. No German government sites were affected, since the infections occurred through Ukrainian accounting software that was not used by German government agencies, Schoenbohm said in a telephone interview with Reuters. Ukrainian officials on Thursday said the crippling worm, which has paralyzed thousands of machines worldwide, was likely targeted at that country's computer infrastructure.     The virus has shut down ports, factories and offices as it spread through internal organizational networks to an estimated 60 countries. BSI has urged German firms to report any problems, install software patches when issued and carry out regular anti-virus software updates. German postal and logistics company Deutsche Post on Tuesday said its Ukrainian division had been hit. Germany's BSI estimates that about 60 percent of the infections occurred in the Ukraine, 30 percent in Russia, and the rest spread among other countries, Schoenbohm said, citing external estimates that over 2,000 companies had been hit worldwide. It was not clear if the main intent was to spread ransomware or to wreak destruction on computer networks, but the incident had  not proven effective as a way to earn money , he said.  Ransomware payments were limited due to rapid action by German email provider Posteo to shut down an email account used by hackers, Schoenbohm said. Ukraine, the epicenter of the cyber strike, has repeatedly accused Russia of orchestrating attacks on its computer systems and critical power infrastructure since its powerful neighbor annexed the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea in 2014. The Kremlin, which has consistently rejected the accusations, said on Wednesday it had no information about the origin of the global cyber attack, which also struck Russian companies such as oil giant Rosneft (ROSN.MM) and a steelmaker.

About 10,000 people have been rescued over the past three days, mainly from unsafe smugglers' dinghies that had set out from Libya. Italy has taken in 82,000 refugees and migrants so far this year, a third more than a year ago. That makes Italy the main point of entry to Europe, a fact that is increasingly influencing domestic politics. Voters dealt a blow to the ruling party in local elections last week, opting for right-wing groups promising a tougher line on immigration.   We will support Italy in discussions on regional cooperation on disembarkation,  a migration spokeswoman for the European Commission told a briefing, adding the bloc's migration ministers would tackle the matter next week in Tallinn.  We understand Italy's concerns and we support their call for a change in the situation,  she said, and the charities running rescue operations would also be informed. The Commission has signaled readiness to give Italy more cash to help with increased arrivals, though officials and diplomats in Brussels were skeptical there would be any swift agreement for other EU states to take in the NGO boats. They said the ports of Barcelona and Marseille were possible options.  Spain's EU mission said it would only unveil their position on the matter at the ministers' meeting in the Estonian capital. The French Foreign Ministry declined to comment. A French diplomatic source said no specific proposal was on the table at this stage, expecting more talks next week. The United Nations says more than 2,000 people perished while attempting the voyage so far in 2017. Non-governmental organizations now account for a big part of the rescue missions and have at times been criticized by politicians, including in Italy. They bring more migrants and refugees to European shores, which is the opposite of what the EU is trying to achieve.  The rescue groups say they are acting on humanitarian grounds and are being scapegoated by politicians keen to tap into higher anti-immigration sentiment. Italy has threatened to close its ports to the NGO boats, though few in Brussels believed it would come to that.   We have not discussed it among ourselves at all so far,  an EU diplomat said.  Seemed like the Italians have just started by detonating this media bomb to lay ground for talks next week.  Some 1.7 million refugees and migrants have reached EU shores after perilous Mediterranean voyages since 2014.  The influx bolstered eurosceptic, anti-immigrant parties, prodding EU leaders into steps to curb arrivals of people fleeing wars and poverty in the Middle East and Africa. The EU's 28 member states are at loggerheads over sharing out those asylum-seekers who make it to Europe, with formerly communist eastern capitals refusing to host any to help frontline states Italy and Greece. To discourage arrivals, the EU has turned increasingly restrictive in granting asylum and is trying to step up deportations of those judged to have arrived only to improve their standard of living, not to escape persecution or war. It has also expanded assistance to Libya and other African states in hopes of improving stability and generating enough sustainable economic opportunity there to diminish the attractiveness of a hazardous journey to Europe.  In addition, the EU runs a naval operation in the southern Mediterranean to rein in people smugglers. But all these measures have not reduced the number of crossings so far.  Politically, the situation is not good for Italy. If the arrival figures keep on rising, Rome will be in trouble,  another EU diplomat said.  But there are no easy solutions. I don't think others would be happy to accept these vessels.  Editing by Alison Williams","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-europe-migrants-italy-idUSKBN19K291"},

The Insurance-Linked Securities Rating Criteria is a sector-specific rating criteria report and draws upon other criteria from the Structured Finance and Insurance sectors in assigning the rating. Insurance-linked securities are used to transfer insurance risks to the capital markets, to fund excess reserve requirements, or to securitize value-in-force cash flows.

Fitch has anticipated increased payout ratios and, therefore, they should not have near-term credit implications. The results, released yesterday, marked the first year that the Federal Reserve (the Fed) did not object to any of the tested banks' capital plans. All banks met the quantitative assessment, and those subject to the qualitative assessment were cleared to proceed with their capital return plans. This will mean a substantial rise in the payout ratio from prior years for some firms. Many have already announced increased dividends and share repurchases in response to their CCAR results. This could reverse the trend of continued capital build for some of these banks. The median increase in the total risk-based capital ratio for the firms that fall under the stress tests between last year's and this year's DFAST was 0.5%. However, Fitch does not expect payouts to increase to a level that would lead to meaningful capital erosion. As with last year's stress test, none of the 34 BHCs tested (up from 33 last year) failed to meet the CCAR quantitative assessment. This was the first year where the qualitative assessment of the CCAR excluded BHCs with less than $250 billion in assets and foreign banking organizations. While the 13 firms subject to the qualitative assessment did not receive capital plan objections, Capital One received a conditional non-objection for qualitative reasons and will have to resubmit its capital plan by the end of the year. The Fed noted that there had been general improvement in the capital planning practices and analyses that were measured under the qualitative assessment process. However, it also noted that there were still weaknesses for some firms, particularly in areas pertaining to controls, loss estimation approaches and identification of risks with new products or changes in underwriting standards. In the case of Capital One, the Fed highlighted several areas pertaining to these weaknesses as the reasons for the conditional non-objection. Both Amex and Capital One changed their capital plans following the release of the DFAST results last week. Overall, the combined DFAST and CCAR results underscore the improvements that have been made by large U.S. BHCs in capital planning processes and building regulatory capital in recent years. This has been a key factor underpinning Fitch's view of the resilience of large U.S. banks.

The fire on June 14 gutted the 24-story Grenfell Tower social housing block in west London, trapping families as they slept, in Britain's deadliest fire since World War Two. Police have said they believe there were no survivors from 23 of the block's 129 apartments.   I am well aware residents and the local people want a much broader investigation and I can fully understand why they would want that,  said Martin Moore-Bick, a retired Court of Appeal judge who was appointed to head a public inquiry into the disaster on Thursday.  Whether my inquiry is the right way in which to achieve that I am more doubtful.  Prime Minister Theresa May promised to hold an inquiry into the disaster after she and the authorities were widely criticized for the initial response to the blaze. Residents of the block have demanded answers as to why the fire spread so rapidly and whether proper fire safety measures had been in place. They also want explanations about why their concerns had been ignored and if the government had been generally neglectful of social housing. Visiting the site of the fire on Thursday, Moore-Bick said his inquiry would be limited to investigating the start of the fire and its rapid spread.  There may be other ways in which that desire for an investigation can be satisfied other than through the work that I am going to do,  he said, adding he hoped an interim report would be released within a year.   The fire at Grenfell Tower, close to one of Britain's richest neighborhoods, has become a lightning rod for anger at May's government with opponents blaming public spending cuts for its devastating effect. It also raised questions about the quality of social housing across the country. Police have said the tower's exterior cladding added for aesthetic and insulation purposes during a refurbishment failed all fire safety tests. Checks carried out since the fire have shown 137 other tower blocks had also failed tests, May's spokesman said on Thursday.  I am determined that there will be justice for all the victims of this terrible tragedy and for their families who have suffered so terribly,  May said in a statement. Joe Delaney from the Grenfell Action Group, an organization of local residents, said they were confident the inquiry would get to the cause of the fire but not that it would expose those responsible.

We understand Italy's concerns and we support their call for a change in the situation,  she said, and the charities running rescue operations would also be informed. The Commission has signaled readiness to give Italy more cash to help with increased arrivals, though officials and diplomats in Brussels were skeptical there would be any swift agreement for other EU states to take in the NGO boats. They said the ports of Barcelona and Marseille were possible options.  Spain's EU mission said it would only unveil their position on the matter at the ministers' meeting in the Estonian capital. The French Foreign Ministry declined to comment. A French diplomatic source said no specific proposal was on the table at this stage, expecting more talks next week. The United Nations says more than 2,000 people perished while attempting the voyage so far in 2017. Non-governmental organizations now account for a big part of the rescue missions and have at times been criticized by politicians, including in Italy. They bring more migrants and refugees to European shores, which is the opposite of what the EU is trying to achieve.  The rescue groups say they are acting on humanitarian grounds and are being scapegoated by politicians keen to tap into higher anti-immigration sentiment. Italy has threatened to close its ports to the NGO boats, though few in Brussels believed it would come to that.   We have not discussed it among ourselves at all so far,  an EU diplomat said.  Seemed like the Italians have just started by detonating this media bomb to lay ground for talks next week.  Some 1.7 million refugees and migrants have reached EU shores after perilous Mediterranean voyages since 2014.  The influx bolstered eurosceptic, anti-immigrant parties, prodding EU leaders into steps to curb arrivals of people fleeing wars and poverty in the Middle East and Africa. The EU's 28 member states are at loggerheads over sharing out those asylum-seekers who make it to Europe, with formerly communist eastern capitals refusing to host any to help frontline states Italy and Greece. To discourage arrivals, the EU has turned increasingly restrictive in granting asylum and is trying to step up deportations of those judged to have arrived only to improve their standard of living, not to escape persecution or war. It has also expanded assistance to Libya and other African states in hopes of improving stability and generating enough sustainable economic opportunity there to diminish the attractiveness of a hazardous journey to Europe.  In addition, the EU runs a naval operation in the southern Mediterranean to rein in people smugglers. But all these measures have not reduced the number of crossings so far.  Politically, the situation is not good for Italy. If the arrival figures keep on rising, Rome will be in trouble,  another EU diplomat said.  But there are no easy solutions. I don't think others would be happy to accept these vessels.  Editing by Alison Williams","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/europe-migrants-italy-idUSL8N1JQ542"},

The dollar index touched its lowest since October - before Donald Trump was elected U.S. president - as investors shifted to the view that the U.S. Federal Reserve might not be the only game in town when it comes to higher interest rates. With the Fed green-lighting dividends and buybacks in major banks as part of another round of stress tests, financial stocks rose but not enough to offset declines in technology and interest-rate sensitive sectors.  Part of the reason why tech is down today is the steam in the recent rotation out of some of big tech winners and into banks,  said Michael Scanlon, portfolio manager at Manulife Asset Management in Boston. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 141.81 points, or 0.66 percent, to 21,312.8, the S&P; 500 lost 19.3 points, or 0.79 percent, to 2,421.39 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 92.96 points, or 1.49 percent, to 6,141.46. European shares failed to hold onto early gains. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index lost 1.36 percent and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.52 percent. Emerging market stocks lost 0.08 percent. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 0.59 percent higher, while Japan's Nikkei rose 0.45 percent. As euro zone bond yields rallied, the euro surged to as high as $1.1434, its strongest since May 2016. The dollar index fell 0.31 percent, with the euro up 0.4 percent to $1.1421. Bank of England Governor Mark Carney surprised many on Wednesday by conceding a hike was likely to be needed as the economy came closer to running at full capacity. That sent sterling above $1.30 on Thursday for the first time in five weeks, leaving it close to its highest levels in nine months. The pound was last trading at $1.2986, up 0.48 percent on the day. The Bank of Canada had its say, with two top policymakers this week suggesting they might tighten monetary policy as early as July. The Canadian dollar strengthened 0.21 percent versus the greenback at 1.301.30 per dollar.  The shifting monetary policy trajectories of other central banks is making other currencies more attractive relative to the U.S. dollar,  said Kathy Lien, managing director at BK Asset Management in New York. The Japanese yen was flat versus the greenback at 112.29 per dollar. Benchmark U.S. Treasury yields rose to five-week highs in sympathy with higher European government debt yields, as investors evaluated the likelihood of less accommodative policy. Treasury 10-year notes last fell 12/32 in price to yield 2.2648 percent, from 2.223 percent late on Wednesday. Oil futures edged up less than 1 percent after hitting a two-week high, extending a rally into a sixth straight session after a decline in weekly U.S. crude production temporarily alleviated concerns about deepening oversupply.

Unlike in other parts of the United Kingdom, abortion is banned in Northern Ireland unless the life or mental health of the mother is in danger. Women can be jailed for life, as can  doctors who perform abortions. In a landmark ruling in 2015, Belfast's High Court found that the laws breached the European Convention on Human Rights by failing to provide exceptions in cases of fatal foetal abnormality or sexual crime. Belfast's Court of Appeal quashed that ruling on Thursday following a challenge by Northern Ireland's justice department and attorney general, concluding that abortion legislation should be a matter for Northern Ireland's provincial assembly. The board of the non-governmental Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission (NIRHC), which brought the original case, said they plan to lodge an appeal to the British Supreme Court in London.  We first raised this issue in 2013 and remain as concerned today in 2017 that the law as it stands does not protect women and girls right to be free from torture and inhuman and degrading treatment,  NIRHC Chief Commissioner Les Allamby said in a statement. Earlier this month, the Supreme Court narrowly upheld a ban on Britain's National Health Service funding abortion care in England for women from Northern Ireland, out of  respect  for the decisions of the region's assembly. That prompted Britain's opposition Labour Party to propose an amendment to Prime Minister Theresa May's new legislative program, calling for women from Northern Ireland to have access to free abortions in England.  Just as in the Republic of Ireland, where the law is equally strict, thousands of women travel to Britain from Northern Ireland every year for abortions. To avoid a potential defeat on the amendment, which had support among May's Conservative lawmakers, finance minister Philip Hammond said London would  fund abortions in England for women arriving here from Northern Ireland . The leader of Northern Ireland's Alliance Party described the move a  helpful measure  but not a solution, as women would still have to travel and face financial costs while Northern Ireland continued to  export  the issue.   We have got to find a solution which is respectful of the sensitivities of our society but at the same time respectful of the fact that women have to be given some degree of control over their own fertility rights,  Naomi Long told reporters.

The fire on June 14 gutted the 24-story Grenfell Tower social housing block in west London, trapping families as they slept, in Britain's deadliest fire since World War Two. Police have said they believe there were no survivors from 23 of the block's 129 apartments.   I am well aware residents and the local people want a much broader investigation and I can fully understand why they would want that,  said Martin Moore-Bick, a retired Court of Appeal judge who was appointed to head a public inquiry into the disaster on Thursday.  Whether my inquiry is the right way in which to achieve that I am more doubtful.  Prime Minister Theresa May promised to hold an inquiry into the disaster after she and the authorities were widely criticized for the initial response to the blaze. Residents of the block have demanded answers as to why the fire spread so rapidly and whether proper fire safety measures had been in place. They also want explanations about why their concerns had been ignored and if the government had been generally neglectful of social housing. Visiting the site of the fire on Thursday, Moore-Bick said his inquiry would be limited to investigating the start of the fire and its rapid spread.  There may be other ways in which that desire for an investigation can be satisfied other than through the work that I am going to do,  he said, adding he hoped an interim report would be released within a year.   The fire at Grenfell Tower, close to one of Britain's richest neighborhoods, has become a lightning rod for anger at May's government with opponents blaming public spending cuts for its devastating effect. It also raised questions about the quality of social housing across the country. Police have said the tower's exterior cladding added for aesthetic and insulation purposes during a refurbishment failed all fire safety tests. Checks carried out since the fire have shown 137 other tower blocks had also failed tests, May's spokesman said on Thursday.  I am determined that there will be justice for all the victims of this terrible tragedy and for their families who have suffered so terribly,  May said in a statement. Joe Delaney from the Grenfell Action Group, an organization of local residents, said they were confident the inquiry would get to the cause of the fire but not that it would expose those responsible.

It is rare to find a female coach in the higher echelons of the game, even among women players. In fact, only five of the world's top 100 women singles players have female coaches. The highest-ranked player with a female coach is world number 14 and new French Open champion Jelena Ostapenko, who is trained by Anabel Medina Garrigues, according to data from the Women's Tennis Association (WTA). The reason for this gender disparity, according to Garrigues, is not because male coaches are any better, but simply because of a dearth of female coaches.  Women players spend years traveling around the world and once they retire - often in their mid-30s - many choose to have a family rather than going into coaching, the Spaniard told Reuters.   It is very difficult to combine the two because coaching a top player involves traveling 20 to 30 weeks of the year,  she said. FILE PHOTO: Spain's Anabel Medina Garrigues returns to France's Julie Coin during their match at the Australian Open tennis tournament in Melbourne, Australia, January 22, 2009.Darren Whiteside/File Photo It's a great shame - as a woman you can understand how a woman player feels on the court, you can understand their thinking. Men's thinking is completely different.  Judy Murray, a former Britain Fed Cup captain and the mother of men's number one Andy Murray, expressed similar sentiments earlier this year when she said there were not  anywhere near enough women coaches .  Women so much better understand how girls think and behave and what their needs are. Teenage girls, in my experience, are not going to open up about their fears - such as issues with their bodies - to male coaches,  she told the BBC.  Andy Murray himself bucked the trend in 2014 when he hired Amelie Mauresmo as his coach, in a high-profile move, though the partnership ended after two years. Garrigues, who won two French Open doubles titles, said Mauresmo had proved a role model for her and other female coaches.  It is very important for people to see a woman coach - the more they see this, the more it will be seen as normal,  the 34-year-old added.   I hope there will be more women coaches in years to come.

The inquiry focuses on Good Days, which operates a co-pay assistance program that it says since 2003 has provided more than $1 billion in assistance to patients to buy expensive drugs for chronic and terminal diseases. The Texas-based charity, previously known as Chronic Disease Fund Inc, has since February filed several lawsuits in federal courts in three states and the District of Columbia to quash summonses the IRS served on drug companies that donated to it. In court papers, the IRS said that in 2011, about 95 percent of the $129.3 million in assistance the charity provided patients to cover co-pays was spent on drugs made by the companies that had made donations for specific diseases.  In other words, the vast majority of funds that are 'donated' by a pharmaceutical manufacturer are returned to it in the form of copay assistance,  Cathy Tai, an IRS agent, said in a court filing. The IRS sent summonses to Novartis AG, Roche Holding AG's Genentech unit, Johnson & Johnson, Bayer AG, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd and Biogen Inc seeking information about donations to Good Days, according to court papers. Robert Zinkham, a lawyer for Good Days, said it has been undergoing an IRS audit for almost four years. Good Days in court papers said it is  fully independent  from its donors. Novartis said it is cooperating with the IRS. Genentech said it acts in accordance with the law. Other companies did not respond to requests for comment. The IRS inquiry was first reported by Bloomberg. As drug price increases have drawn the ire of politicians and the healthcare industry, concern has grown that donations made by pharmaceutical companies to patient-assistance groups may be contributing to price inflation. Drug companies are prohibited from subsidizing co-payments for patients enrolled in U.S. government healthcare programs like Medicare and Medicaid. But they may donate to nonprofits that can provide co-pay assistance as long as they do not influence how the charities operate. Several drugmakers have disclosed they received subpoenas from the U.S. Attorney's Office in Massachusetts related to their support for patient-assistance charities. Zinkham said Good Days also received a subpoena but the probe appeared unrelated to the IRS audit.

Unless national governments assist with funding them, then the cost will ultimately fall on airports, airlines and air travelers,  he said, adding there was no time to lose to implement the measures.  Airlines and airports across Europe said it was too early to give details of any operational impact or costs. Airlines such as Lufthansa and Norwegian Air Shuttle said they would work with authorities to implement the measures.

The airline industry is very capable at adapting to changes in the security regulations so I think it's marginal on the overall scale of things,  he said at an event in Brussels. The airports with the most U.S.–bound flights in Europe are London Heathrow, Paris Charles de Gaulle, Frankfurt, Amsterdam Schiphol and Dublin. A spokeswoman for Schiphol airport, where there have been long security queues this summer, said moving U.S. flights to another part of Schiphol could be an option, but it was unclear at the moment whether that would be necessary. A German interior ministry spokeswoman said passengers flying to the United States should expect extra security checks on devices bigger than a smartphone. She declined to comment on details of the checks for security reasons.   The new measures will avoid an extension of the ban on passengers bringing large electronic devices such as laptops and tablets into cabins, which many had said would have resulted in widespread disruption at airports and led to increased fire risks from storing such devices in the hold.   We are satisfied that, at this stage, the U.S. has... instead decided in favor of more targeted measures to address identified risks, without compromising safety,  ACI Europe said.  Emirates Airline, one of those affected by the laptop ban introduced in March, said it would work to implement the new measures as soon as possible, with a view to the ban being lifted.

The agency plans to deploy a team of senior reviewers with expertise in drugs to treat diseases with 200,000 patients or fewer, known as orphan drugs. The goal will be to eliminate a backlog of 200 orphan drug designation requests, starting with the oldest. The agency aims to clear the backlog by mid-September. Pharmaceutical companies have become increasingly interested in developing orphan drugs since they can command prices in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. Soliris, for example, a drug made by Alexion Pharmaceuticals Inc to treat paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, a rare disease that destroys red blood cells, can cost up to $440,000 a year. In 2016 the FDA received 568 new requests for orphan drug designation, more than double the number received in 2012.  Congress gave us tools to incentivize the development of novel therapies for rare diseases and we intend to use these resources to their fullest extent,  FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said in a statement.  The agency is in a broad push to speed new drugs to the market, a mandate expressed in legislation passed last year known as the 21st Century Cures Act. On Tuesday the FDA released a list of roughly 180 drugs that have lost patent protection but have no generic rivals, and said it will prioritize applications of generic competition for these drugs. The goal is to prevent the kind of price hikes seen when Martin Shkreli, formerly chief executive officer of Turing Pharmaceuticals, acquired and then raised the price of an old anti-parasitic drug called Daraprim to $750 a pill from $13.50. The agency plans to respond to orphan drug applicants within 90 days of receiving an application and establish an Orphan Products Council to help ensure the FDA is applying a consistent approach to regulating and reviewing these products. Drugs that win orphan drug status are given a variety of incentives, including tax credits and eligibility for seven years of marketing exclusivity.

A full list of rating actions is at the end of this commentary. KEY RATING DRIVERS IDRS, SUPPORT RATINGS AND SUPPORT RATING FLOORS The three banks' Long-Term IDRs, Support Rating and Support Ratings Floors are underpinned by potential state support, in case of need, and are aligned with the sovereign rating (B-/Stable). In assessing support, Fitch considers the banks' state ownership, government control through supervisory board representation at each of the banks and the track-record of support to date. We also factor in the policy roles of BBK and DBRB as the country's largest providers of government programme lending backed by dedicated government funding, the systemic importance of BBK (market share of 41% by assets and 45% of retail deposits) and the government's subsidiary liability on DBRB's bond obligations, which, however, is as yet untested. The authorities' ability to provide support in foreign currency is limited, in Fitch's view, given the three banks' significant external funding (a combined USD2.2 billion at end-2016, including USD1.2 billion short-term debt maturing over the 12 months starting from 1 March 2017) and high dollarisation of domestic liabilities (USD7.3 billion at end-2016), largely in the form of customer deposits (bonds at DBRB). These FX liabilities are large relative to the country's international reserves of USD5.2 billion, while FX liquidity at all three banks is largely invested in the FX bonds issued by the government (long-term debt) and central bank (short-term debt). We expect the authorities to make this FX liquidity available to banks, in case of need, to avoid defaults on external borrowings. Positively, around 40% of the latter comprise facilities from Russian creditors and so are more likely to be rolled over, in our view. Liquidity shortages in local currency, if any, are likely to be covered by the central bank (BBK, BIB) or the authorities (DBRB). There were no new capital contributions from the government at the three banks in 2016 (although government-held subordinated debt at BIB was converted into equity) and none are expected in the near term. The original plan to partially privatise BBK announced in 2016 has now been postponed and the bank will focus on structural reforms as Fitch understands from management. The privatisation of BIB (100% stake) is also unlikely in the near term in Fitch's view given this bank's similar need for structural reforms and uncertainty over the country's economic prospects. We believe the authorities' propensity to support will remain unchanged for both BBK and BIB as long as the government holds a controlling stake. VRs - BBK, BIB The banks' standalone credit profiles are closely linked to that of the sovereign due to large direct exposure to the government and, more generally, the public sector. This makes the banks' asset quality dependent on the state of government finances and the ability of the authorities to support macroeconomic stability and the public sector. At end-2016, direct exposure to the sovereign (including claims on the government and the central bank) relative to Fitch Core Capital (FCC) was 3x at BBK, and 2.7x at BIB. Loans issued to public sector corporates (including those issued under government programmes) contributed a further 3.8x FCC at BBK and 2x at BIB. Credit risks remain high as the economy is sluggish and borrower performance remains constrained by generally significant leverage in the corporate sector and loan dollarisation (BBK: 60%; BIB: 70% of loans), while the share of hedged borrowers is limited. Asset quality metrics have weakened across the board during 2015-2016. We expect this trend to continue through 2017 as operating conditions remain challenging. BBK's individually impaired loans (as per IFRS accounts) grew to a high at 37% of end-2016 gross loans from 30% at end-2015, reflecting deterioration in borrowers' financial standing and/or collateral value. At the same time, loans over 90 days overdue remained low, at 1.6% of loans, helped by loan restructuring/roll-overs but also reflecting the high share of borrowers benefitting from government support (in the form of subsidies on interest payments or loan repayments under state guarantees). BIB's individually impaired loans were also high at 30% of loans at end-2016, down from 34% at end-2015, and loans over 90 days overdue were 11.6%. Asset quality ratios have benefitted from moderate balance sheet clean-ups arranged by the authorities in 2015-2016 through exchange of selected problem loans for long-term bonds issued by the Ministry of Finance, DBRB or local governments. We expect that clean-up will continue although this is likely to be a gradual process given the government's limited financial capacity for significant support. Fitch views capitalisation as modest given the banks' credit exposures and levels of impaired loans. The unreserved portion of the latter was equal to a high 1.7x FCC at BBK and 1x FCC at BIB.  At end-5M17, the regulatory Tier 1 and Total capital adequacy ratios were 16.2% and 18.6%, respectively, at BBK and 10.5% and 15.2%, respectively, at BIB. These capital cushions allowed limited loss absorption capacity equal to 9% of loans at BBK and 5% at BIB, without breaching regulatory minimum levels (including buffers). Pre-impairment profit (net of accrued interest not received in cash) was a solid 5.8% of average gross loans (BBK) and 8% (BIB). However, in Fitch's view there is uncertainty about the ability of some borrowers to service loans out of their own cash flows rather than through receipt of new credit. Large loan impairment charges (equal to 65% of pre-impairment operating profit at BBK in 2016 and 98% at BIB) constrained returns on equity (ROAE) at 8.9% at BBK and 0% at BIB. Core funding is from customers (over 70% of liabilities), but with a high proportion of foreign currency accounts (67% at BBK, 62% at BIB). Deposit trends have been stable recently, limiting immediate liquidity pressure. However, liquidity management remains highly dependent on the confidence of depositors and support from the authorities. Fitch has not assigned a VR to DBRB due to the bank's special status as a development institution and its close association with the authorities. RATING SENSITIVITIES IDRS, SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOORS Changes to the banks' IDRs are likely to be linked to changes in the sovereign credit profile, and the Stable Outlooks reflect that on the sovereign ratings. The banks' ratings could also be downgraded, and hence notched down from the sovereign, in case timely support is not made available, when needed, or if increased pressure on the country's external finances heightens the risk of capital or exchange controls being introduced prior to a sovereign default. VR - BBK, BIB Downgrades of VRs could result from capital erosion due to a further marked deterioration in asset quality or a significant tightening of FX liquidity positions. Upgrades of VRs above the sovereign rating are extremely unlikely given the close linkages between sovereign and bank credit profiles. The rating actions are as follows: BBK and BIB Long-Term Foreign Currency IDR affirmed at 'B-'; Outlook Stable Short-Term Foreign Currency IDR affirmed at 'B' Viability Rating affirmed at 'b-' Support Rating affirmed at '5' Support Rating Floor affirmed at 'B-' DBRB Long-Term Foreign Currency IDR affirmed at 'B-'; Outlook Stable Short-Term Foreign Currency IDR affirmed at 'B' Long-Term Local Currency IDR affirmed at 'B-'; Outlook Stable Support Rating affirmed at '5' Support Rating Floor affirmed at 'B-' Contact: Primary Analyst Anna Erachina Associate Director +7 495 956 7063 Fitch Ratings CIS Limited Valovaya Street, 26 Moscow 115054 Secondary Analyst Ilya Sarzhin Analyst +7 495 956 9983 Committee Chairperson Alexander Danilov Senior Director +7 495 956 2408 Media Relations: Julia Belskaya von Tell, Moscow, Tel: +7 495 956 9908, Email: julia.belskayavontell@fitchratings.com; Peter Fitzpatrick, London, Tel: +44 20 3530 1103, Email: peter.fitzpatrick@fitchratings.com.

A full list of ratings follows at the end of this release. Fitch views the new proposal, which replaces WBA's previous proposal to acquire Rite Aid in its entirety, to be a strategic positive based on increased geographic coverage, including the Northeastern U.S., although neutral to its credit profile. WBA's 'BBB' rating incorporates the company's leading position and increasing market share in the growing drugstore category. WBA's ample free cash flow (FCF) provides it the financial flexibility to invest strategically in its business and new opportunities while managing its balance sheet. The addition of 2,186 Rite Aid locations offers WBA the ability to strengthen its competitive position while generating synergies of around $400 million as guided by management. Given the significantly reduced purchase price, pro forma adjusted debt/EBITDAR is expected to remain around 3.3x, similar to latest 12-month levels (excluding funded debt associated with the proposed Rite Aid acquisition). Fitch expects adjusted leverage to remain near these levels over the next 24-36 months, absent further investment opportunities. Rating concerns include ongoing pressure on U.S. pharmacy reimbursement rates, WBA's under-penetration in the U.S. specialty pharmacy business, and integration risks with the addition of Rite Aid stores. KEY RATING DRIVERS Since Walgreen Co. (WAG) completed its merger with Alliance Boots to form WBA on Dec. 31, 2014, the combined entity has developed a holistic strategy to grow its presence in the U.S. healthcare market. The company has undertaken a number of strategic priorities to drive the business, including the following: --AmerisourceBergen Corp. (ABC) Long-Term Relationship: In March 2013, WAG and wholesaler ABC announced a 10-year agreement (subsequently extended to 2026) to source all drugs through a newly formed strategic partnership which would enable sharing of synergies by layering ABC's generic volume into WBA. Previously, WAG sourced branded pharmaceuticals through Cardinal Health Inc., specialty pharmaceuticals through ABC and generics directly from manufacturers. Management also believed an economic interest in ABC was important and structured warrants and an open-market purchase program. WBA currently owns approximately 26% of ABC at a cost of approximately $3.1 billion after exercising its final warrants for $1.2 billion. --Cost Structure Opportunities: The company has identified $1.5 billion in cost reduction opportunities primarily in the Walgreens U.S. business, up from $1 billion initially identified in June 2012 at the announcement of the WAG/Alliance Boots partnership, and plans to complete the program by the end of fiscal 2017. Key areas of focus have included retail footprint optimization, headquarters rationalization and store operations efficiencies. WBA has a multifaceted strategy in terms of the front-end, which represents around 30% of enterprise sales volume, three-quarters of which is generated via Walgreens stores in the U.S. First, new management sees an opportunity to improve basic operations such as inventory management and shrink reduction. Second, management believes Walgreens has historically been overly focused on promotions, with many loss-leaders driving down margins. WBA has been reducing promotions and relying more on strong operations and its Balance Rewards loyalty program to drive sales. Third, WBA plans to revitalize its beauty offering in the U.S., using elements of the successful Boots model including owned brands such as No 7, Soap & Glory and Botanics. Fitch views as positive efforts to drive installed loyalty programs as a means to improve customer stickiness. RATING STRENGTHS Category Growth and Competitive Resilience WBA benefits from share gains in its U.S. pharmacy business, which accounts for approximately 50% of total company sales, with the industry expected to grow 1%-2% annually each in volume and pricing. The industry has benefitted from an aging U.S. population, enrollment increases due to the Affordable Care Act (ACA), and prescription price increases, particularly for specialty pharmaceuticals. Unlike many other retail categories, Fitch views pharmacies as having limited competition from new formats given fixed-price contracts and pharmacist supply constraints. Mail-order, which emerged as a major threat to retailers over the past several decades, appears to have peaked, particularly given  90-day at retail  offers across the industry as well as a number of branded drugs shifting to over-the-counter. However, there has been significant pharmacy reimbursement pressure due to shifts to managed care from cash over the 1990s through mid-2000s and growth in Medicaid/Medicare over the last few years, and this pressure is expected to continue over the next few years as payers strive to contain healthcare costs. Economics of scale are critical to negotiate better pricing on pharmaceutical purchases to help offset some of the reimbursement pressure. As a result, Fitch expects WBA will continue to drive U.S. share gains with volume growth in the 2%-3% range while the overall industry grows at 1%-2%. Fitch has currently not modelled any impact on total coverage, volume, or pricing based on potential changes to the ACA or other legislative activity affecting the pharmaceutical industry. Front-end sales have grown in the low single digits in recent years, and have shown resilience to competition from channels including discounters and online. Fitch believes that WBA's low front-end ticket at less than $10 in most cases, convenience model, and purchase immediacy have allowed it to effectively compete against new entrants. Fitch expects WBA's front-end comparable store sales (comps) to be slightly positive over the next three years. Market Share Gains Expected to Continue With 20% prescription market share, WBA is the second-largest player in the U.S. and has driven market share through execution and scale benefits. As a leading market player with strong loyalty from a sticky customer base, WBA is a preferred retail partner and can compete effectively for inclusion in pharmacy networks with acceptable financial terms. WBA's size also permits cost-effective pharmaceuticals buying, enhanced by its partnership with wholesaler ABC, to leverage the combined buying scale. As a result of WBA's scale and execution, the company has built a long track record of growth, including U.S. comparable prescription volume growth of 3.5% and 2.3% in fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2016, respectively. This growth reflects market share gains in light of the structural challenges facing the retail pharmacy space. Industry challenges, such as increased concentration of payers (including the government), mail-order, and narrow networks, have not had a negative impact on Walgreens' volume growth and, in Fitch's view, have likely helped it gain share against smaller operators and independents. However, these challenges have dampened gross margins and Fitch expects WBA's U.S pharmacy gross margins to decline 30bps-40bps annually. Despite overall market strength, WBA is underpenetrated in specialty pharmaceuticals relative to the market and competitors such as CVS Caremark (CVS), which has made targeted investments into the specialty category and benefits from its purchase of pharmacy benefits manager (PBM) and mail-order operator Caremark in 2006. CVS currently has approximately a 25% share of the U.S. specialty market, which Fitch estimates at more than twice that of Walgreens. As specialty pharmaceutical growth will dominate overall spending growth over the rating horizon, WBA is somewhat structurally disadvantaged. The company's recently announced strategic alliance to combine its specialty pharmacy business with Prime Therapeutics LLC could improve its growth profile while benefitting from scale efficiencies. WBA's proposed acquisition of 2,186 Rite Aid locations would yield increased geographic coverage, particularly in certain Northeastern markets of the U.S., improving its ability to compete for inclusion in narrow and preferred pharmacy networks. At the end of fiscal 2016, 76% of the U.S. population lived within a five-mile radius of a Walgreens or Duane Reade (also owned by WBA) and Fitch anticipates the coverage is likely to rise modestly following the Rite Aid stores acquisition. Fitch anticipates WBA can grow its U.S. pharmaceuticals sales at around 4% annually, by taking share in non-specialty categories while maintaining or losing modest share in the specialty category. Fitch expects WBA's international business, approximately 30% of total company sales, to grow in the low single digits annually over the forecast horizon, driven by 1%-2% comps in international retail and modest growth in the international wholesale business. International gross margins are expected to be flattish in the low-20% range, as the dynamics pressuring gross margins in the U.S. are less prevalent abroad. RATING CONCERNS Gross Margin Pressure Fitch sees continued gross margin pressure on sales of pharmaceuticals in the U.S. Structural margin pressure has been a consequence of increased penetration of the government as a pharmaceutical payer under the Medicare and Medicaid programs, ongoing pressure from commercial payers, and a mix shift toward the  90-day at retail  offering. This pressure has been somewhat mitigated by the growth in generic penetration over the last few years, though this is expected to taper off given a lighter calendar of branded expirations. Projected margins may also be affected by the growth in preferred/narrow networks, as WBA sacrifices margin for network inclusion to drive volume. Over the forecast horizon, Fitch expects U.S. pharmacy gross margins to decline 30bps-40bps annually, while U.S front-end gross margins are expected to remain relatively flat. Fitch has also assumed modest gross margin pressure in WBA's international retail pharmacy and wholesale businesses. Cash Flow Deployment Options/Lack of Financial Targets WBA has shown a willingness to use cash and leverage to grow its business. Examples include its strategic investment in ABC and its announced merger with Rite Aid. Management has expressed support of partnerships and the need to reduce inefficiency in the U.S. healthcare system. This mindset, coupled with management's lack of publicly stated financial targets, yields some risk with regard to the pace of debt paydown. Front-End Competition from Online Players WBA's enterprise front-end sales have been resilient to strengthened competition from discounters and online channels. Fitch believes this is due to low average ticket prices, WBA's convenience model, and purchase immediacy. However, online merchants, Amazon.com, Inc. in particular, continue to improve their business models and speed of delivery, which could affect WBA's higher-margin front-end sales in the future. Amazon.com's proposed purchase of Whole Foods Market, Inc. suggests the online retailer could be an increasing threat for share gains in some of WBA's categories like food consumables. DERIVATION SUMMARY WBA's 'BBB' rating incorporates the company's leading position in the growing drugstore category, which has proven to be resilient to discount and online competition. The rating also considers the company's ample FCF generation and balance sheet management. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: --Fitch expects 2.5%-3% sales growth at legacy WBA, driven by 4% U.S. pharmacy and 0%-1% U.S. front-end comps and low-single-digit growth in the company's international retail and wholesale businesses. Sales growth for the acquired Rite Aid stores could initially be somewhat negative given Rite Aid's current trajectory, but should improve to modestly positive if WBA is able to reverse the trend. --Standalone EBITDA, which was $9 billion in fiscal 2016, is expected to increase toward $10 billion over the next 36 months, primarily on sales growth. Margins are expected to be range-bound given ongoing reimbursement rate pressure. EBITDA of approximately $9.4 billion on a pro forma basis including the acquired Rite Aid stores could improve toward $10.5 billion over the 36 months following the close of the transaction on modest core growth and Rite Aid synergies. --FCF is projected to be around $4.5 billion on a pro forma basis, prior to merger-related expenses and restructuring charges. FCF is expected to increase toward $5 billion on Rite Aid synergies in the 36 months following the close of the acquisition. Pro forma leverage is expected to be around 3.3x and remain near this level, absent further investment opportunities. --Standalone FCF is projected to be around $4 billion annually beginning fiscal 2017, and could be used to resume WBA's share repurchase program while maintaining leverage in the low-3.0x range. RATING SENSITIVITIES Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action --Persistently negative front-end comparable store sales or flattish prescription volume growth, indicating market share erosion; --Unsuccessful execution yielding flattish or modestly declining EBITDA from pro forma levels, driven by greater-than-expected gross margin declines on worsening reimbursement rates or weak implementation of merchandising/systems initiatives; --A debt-financed transaction which diminishes confidence in WBA's ability to sustain adjusted leverage below 3.5x. Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action Given WBA's lack of stated targets with respect to financial leverage, an upgrade is unlikely due to the risk of a leveraging transaction. However, Fitch would view positively a public commitment to sustain leverage below 3x. LIQUIDITY At May 31, 2017, the company had $12.2 billion in cash and full availability on its revolvers. WBA had $19 billion of debt at May 31, 2017, of which approximately $6 billion was expected to finance the Rite Aid acquisition. Given the revised transaction terms, Fitch expects WBA to pay down debt in addition to the $3.5 billion of notes redeemed in June 2017. Year-end debt is expected to be in the $13 billion range, consisting primarily of unsecured notes. Fitch would expect to withdraw its ratings of redeemed debt upon repayment. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has affirmed WBA's ratings as follows: Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. --Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'BBB'; --Unsecured revolver (as co-borrower) at 'BBB'; --Unsecured term loans at 'BBB'; --Unsecured bonds at 'BBB'; --Short-Term IDR at 'F2'; --Commercial paper at 'F2'. Walgreen Co. --Unsecured revolver (as co-borrower) at 'BBB'; --Unsecured term loan (as co-borrower) at 'BBB'; --Unsecured bonds at 'BBB'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.

On Thursday, the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee adopted legislation that includes Federal Aviation Administration reforms, but unlike a House panel, does not spin off air traffic control and leaves it with the FAA.  The support is not there,  said Senator Bill Nelson, the top Democrat on the panel. The U.S. House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee approved the privatization plan on Tuesday, putting air traffic control under the oversight of a nonprofit corporation. President Donald Trump has said the move would modernize air traffic control and lower flying costs. The proposal has drawn fire from private plane owners and rural airports. Critics say it would hand control of a key asset to special interests and big airlines. American Airlines Group Inc, United Airlines , Southwest Airlines Co and JetBlue Airways Corp all back the proposal. Congress has until Sept. 30 to reauthorize the FAA, but Republican Senator John Thune, chairman of the commerce committee, said the Senate may not take up the proposal until after the August recess, potentially leaving little time to come up a compromise measure. Both the House and Senate measures would make it illegal for an airline to bump an already boarded passenger from a flight. In April, a United passenger was forcibly removed from his seat, prompting public outrage. The airline has since banned the practice. The Senate bill also requires new rules that would mandate that airlines promptly refund passengers for baggage fees or other fees if they do not receive the service. The House bill would require the FAA to set minimum seat sizes on U.S. airlines and a minimum distance between rows to  protect the safety and health of airline passengers.  The average distance between rows of seats has dropped from 35 inches in the 1970s to about 31 inches today, supporters say, and the average width of airline seats has shrunk from 18 inches to about 16-1/2 inches. One contentious issue is training requirements for pilots, and whether certain simulated training hours can be counted. Thune said that two-thirds of U.S. airports are only served by regional carriers and that there is a  crisis  in trying to attract pilots, while Democrats said the revised rules could lead to unqualified pilots. Both bills would seek to speed approval of some commercial drone use and testing, while studying privacy implications. The measures also require medium- and large-sized airports to provide clean private rooms in all terminals for nursing mothers and would enshrine a ban on making in-flight mobile phone calls in law. The Senate bill would direct a study of airplane air quality and require a study of whether airlines are shrinking airplane bathrooms to add more seats.

Energy firms have faced shareholder demands to do more to curb carbon emissions, while some pension funds are demanding more commitment to climate goals from firms they invest in. Yet progress has still been modest since the Paris deal agreed by almost 200 nations came into force in November last year, aiming to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times.  Lots of investors are looking to align their investments with a 2 degrees world. It's just at what pace they all get there,  said Fiona Reynolds, managing director at the United Nations-backed Principles for Responsible Investment. Advocates of the climate deal hope new impetus will come from Thursday's document published by the Financial Stability Board's Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), a group set up by G20 nations. The task force's document outlines a voluntary framework for companies to disclose the financial impact of climate-related risks and opportunities, drawing support from more than 100 companies with $11 trillion of assets. It aims to help investors, lenders, insurers and other stakeholders understand how firms manage climate risk and guide companies on information they should provide to explain their climate strategy, ultimately helping ensure corporate laggards are held to account.  The more companies report effectively on climate related risks and opportunities, the easier it becomes for investors to allocate the substantial amounts of capital required to implement the Paris Agreement,  said Philippe Desfossés, chief executive of French pension fund ERAFP. High Benchmark Sweden's largest national pension fund AP7 set a high benchmark in June when it named six companies it said had breached the Paris accord, and ditched them from its portfolio. Several energy firms have faced shareholder rebellions at annual general meetings over their stance on climate change. ExxonMobil (XON.N) has been accused of misleading investors by a U.S. prosecutor, allegations the U.S. firm has dismissed as  frivolous . Many energy firms have been sharing more information on their climate strategies, and some mining companies are starting to follow suit, such as iron ore miner Vale (VALE5.SA). In a Reuters survey, 13 leading public and corporate pension schemes in Europe, Asia and North America managing a total $1.1 trillion said they were committed to engaging firms on their climate strategy. Three of those funds said explicitly that divestment was an option if talks were unsatisfactory. However, some funds said the threat of divestment was not the best approach to encouraging firms to improve environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues.  We think engagement investment is about promoting companies to be involved with ESG through engagement,  said Hiroichi Yagi, an adviser to the pension fund of Japan's Secom, a leading security firm.  If you just sell and stop investing in companies that are not mindful of climate change, then you are abandoning engagement there,  he said, adding that he was not aware of any Japanese pension funds advocating divestment as an option.  Glacial Pace  To date, most divestments have tended to be from companies mining coal, the dirtiest energy source. Some large investors, such as Norway's $960-billion sovereign wealth fund, have set limits on how much revenues can come from that source. The most active asset owners on climate change have tended to be big pension schemes and sovereign wealth funds - Norway's and New Zealand's have reduced exposure to fossil fuels. Such firms have more in-house analysts to assess investments. Smaller funds are making slower progress in pushing climate issues up the agenda in determining investment policy. A survey by consultants Mercer of 1,241 European pension schemes, half of which had less than 100 million euros ($114 million) in assets, showed just 5 percent considered the financial impact of climate change on their portfolios. However, that was up from 4 percent a year earlier.  It's ironic that the pace of response to this enormous issue is best described as glacial, outside a small group of leading funds,  said Phil Edwards, Mercer's Global Director of Strategic Research, calling for more  urgency  to be applied. Advocates of the Paris accord hope the TFCD's framework document will particularly assist smaller firms. Britain's Environment Agency Protection Fund, a founder member of the Transition Pathway Initiative (TPI) that aims to help asset owners assess firms, said more than 3 trillion pounds  ($3.9 trillion) of assets were now being invested using the TPI's guidelines.  We are aiming to be one of the first asset owners to do this to show our support for the TCFD and its pick up by other asset owners,  said Faith Ward, the scheme's chief responsible investment officer. She said her fund planned to link its annual report to the TCFD framework.

Trump, who often decries what he calls  fake news  in the American media and who this week attacked CNN, the New York Times and the Washington Post, took aim on Thursday at the hosts of the MSNBC program  Morning Joe,  Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski. The Republican president called Brzezinski, a journalist and daughter of former White House national security advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski,  low I.Q. Crazy Mika  and said she was  bleeding badly from a face-lift  when she visited one of his golf resorts around New Year's Eve. He referred to former Republican U.S. congressman Scarborough as  Psycho Joe.  Trump is known for his prolific Twitter habit, which includes attacking critics and rivals, but his tweets on Thursday drew a particularly strong response.  It's a sad day for America when the president spends his time bullying, lying and spewing petty personal attacks instead of doing his job,  MSNBC's communications office said on Twitter.  Morning Joe  takes sometimes strong views on Trump and the president has often criticized its hosts in the past. Comcast Corp owns NBCUniversal, MSNBC's parent company. Republican lawmakers and others sharply rebuked Trump.  Mr. President, your tweet was beneath the office and represents what is wrong with American politics, not the greatness of America,  Republican Senator Lindsey Graham wrote on Twitter. Another Republican senator, Ben Sasse, tweeted,  Please just stop. This isn't normal and it's beneath the dignity of your office.  Democrats seized on the remarks as an example of what they view as Trump's sexism.  Trump's bullying tweets are an attack on women everywhere,  Democratic National Committee spokeswoman Adrienne Watson said in a statement.  From his Twitter slurs to his policies, we have a president who continues to show us he has no regard for women and whose comments demean the office he holds.  The president's tweets created a new distraction as senators in his own party struggled to bridge their differences and agree on major healthcare legislation. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders defended his tweets as simply a question of responding to criticism.  I don't think that the president has ever been someone that gets attacked and doesn't push back,  she told Fox News Channel.  People on that show have personally attacked him many times,  she added.  This is a president who fights fire with fire and certainly will not be allowed to be bullied by liberal media and the liberal elites within the media, or Hollywood or anywhere else.  Democratic Senator Ed Markey wrote on Twitter:  If you can't stifle the press, then you attack them personally. Today's tweets from Donald Trump are unpresidential and warrant an apology.

The measures, announced on Wednesday by the Department of Homeland Security and applicable to all commercial flights to the United States, include increased explosive trace detection efforts and more screening of passengers.  It's difficult to estimate, at this point, how much the new measures will cost, but it is likely to be significant,  a spokesman for ACI Europe told Reuters.   Unless national governments assist with funding them, then the cost will ultimately fall on airports, airlines and air travelers,  he said, adding there was no time to lose to implement the measures.  Airlines and airports across Europe said it was too early to give details of any operational impact or costs. Airlines such as Lufthansa and Norwegian Air Shuttle said they would work with authorities to implement the measures.  Willie Walsh, the CEO of British Airways parent IAG, said he did not expect a major increase in costs.    The airline industry is very capable at adapting to changes in the security regulations so I think it's marginal on the overall scale of things,  he said at an event in Brussels. The airports with the most U.S.–bound flights in Europe are London Heathrow, Paris Charles de Gaulle, Frankfurt, Amsterdam Schiphol and Dublin. A spokeswoman for Schiphol airport, where there have been long security queues this summer, said moving U.S. flights to another part of Schiphol could be an option, but it was unclear at the moment whether that would be necessary. A German interior ministry spokeswoman said passengers flying to the United States should expect extra security checks on devices bigger than a smartphone. She declined to comment on details of the checks for security reasons.   The new measures will avoid an extension of the ban on passengers bringing large electronic devices such as laptops and tablets into cabins, which many had said would have resulted in widespread disruption at airports and led to increased fire risks from storing such devices in the hold.   We are satisfied that, at this stage, the U.S. has... instead decided in favor of more targeted measures to address identified risks, without compromising safety,  ACI Europe said.

Faris, 18, chose to study the Israeli curriculum instead of the Palestinian equivalent in the hope that it will open more doors at colleges in Israel and help him get work there.  I know it's the 'Occupation'. But Palestine, Israel -- I don't care. I just want to go to university,  said Abu-Mayyaleh, who lives and studies in East Jerusalem, annexed by Israel after the 1967 Middle East war.  Israel hopes many other Palestinians will share his attitude after offering additional funding to Palestinian schools in East Jerusalem if they agree to teach the Israeli curriculum. The aim, it says, is to help young Palestinians gain the qualifications they need to find work in Israel more easily. It also offers Israel a chance to steer some Palestinians away from a curriculum it says is rife with anti-Semitism and incitement. It is a loaded issue for principals, parents and pupils. Many Palestinian schools badly need funding, but embracing the Israeli education program -- including subjects such as Israeli civics and history -- is seen by many Palestinians as tantamount to adopting the historical narrative of the enemy. Only 10 of the city's public Palestinian schools have so far agreed to the change on offer since last year, and only about 5,000 of the 110,00 Palestinian pupils of East Jerusalem's 185 public and private establishments study the Israeli program.   It's not easy,  said a Palestinian member of staff who teaches Israeli civics at a Palestinian school.  The children want to learn about their own people. I teach a lot of things I don't believe in, but I have no choice.   Not every school uses the same textbooks but the Palestinian and Israeli programs differ widely on some historical events. Under the Israeli curriculum, pupils are taught that the Arab-Israeli war of 1948, the year Israel was created, was a battle for independence for a state that would be a haven for Jews after centuries of persecution.  The Palestinian curriculum teaches it as the Nakba, or Catastrophe, when hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were driven from their homes during the fighting. Gaps  Staff at the East Jerusalem schools who spoke to Reuters asked not to be identified because they did not have permission to be interviewed and feared for their jobs.  The head of one East Jerusalem school who rejected the Israeli curriculum said authorities had offered to triple the annual budget for each pupil, from about 500 shekels ($144)to 1,500. Another Palestinian headmaster said:  They offered me more money, but I said no. The parents here don't want it. It's not our story, we want to teach the Palestinian story.   Israeli Education Minister Naftali Bennett, head of the religious-nationalist Jewish Home party, said the program was meant to close gaps in education, poverty and unemployment that have afflicted Jerusalem's 320,000 Palestinians for decades.   A young man from East Jerusalem who has an Israeli diploma has a much higher chance of getting a job. Our aim is to spur economic progress -- that's why we're using a carrot, not a stick,  Bennett told Reuters. Palestinian school children walk home after school in the East Jerusalem neighbourhood of Jabel Mukhaber June 12, 2017.Ammar AwadThe Education Ministry did not provide full details of the extra budget and incentives these schools have received, beyond funding for extra teachers and teaching hours.  Asked whether funding could be tripled per pupil at schools that adopted the Israeli curriculum, an Education Ministry source said it was  certainly possible  but the offers of extra funding varied from school to school. The Association for Civil Rights in Israel (ACRI) and other rights groups say the program is discriminatory. They say Palestinian schools in East Jerusalem are underfunded and the Israeli authorities should fund all the city's schools equally.  Israeli authorities have for years neglected the education system in East Jerusalem,  said Nisreen Alyan, head of the Jerusalem Program at ACRI.  While it is the first time the government and municipality see a need to close the gaps in East Jerusalem, the program is designed according to a political agenda.    Bennett rejected the criticism.  Slideshow (10 Images) I'm not forcing anything on anyone. I'm saying 'make it available',  he said.  I believe market forces will do the job. Ultimately, parents will tell their children: 'I want you to get the Israeli diploma so you get a job in programing, not cleaning'.  Classroom Shortage Israeli authorities recognize that gaps in education deepen a chasm between Jerusalem's east -- which Palestinians want to be the capital of their future state -- and predominantly Jewish west, making it harder for Palestinians to get ahead in life.   More than a third of Jerusalem's Palestinian children drop out of high school. Among Israelis only about 2 percent do so. Almost 80 percent of the city's Palestinians live below the poverty line and just 40 percent are employed, mostly at the lower rungs of the labor market ladder, according to the Israeli Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS).  The Israeli national employment rate stands at 64 percent, and in Jerusalem 58 percent of Israelis are employed, according to the CBS. Supreme Court petitions and reports by rights groups including ACRI show consistent gaps between Jerusalem's Palestinian and Israeli schools, including allocation of staff and funding for educational programs. There is a shortage of 3,800 classrooms, disproportionately affecting the poorer Palestinian and ultra-Orthodox Jewish sectors. The municipality has rented apartments in some areas to create space, or supplied mobile shacks to serve as classrooms. In the Jabel Mukhaber neighborhood of East Jerusalem, the Al-Sawahereh primary school for boys is housed in a converted two-storey apartment building. Pupils are crammed, mostly in groups of 25-30, into six classrooms of about 12 square meters (130 square feet), and facilities are poor. When the bell sounds at the end of the day, 150 boys in bright blue uniforms run through a sparse, narrow yard and pour out of a driveway gate into a bumpy, broken road lined with overflowing rubbish containers. Residents see a stark contrast with the well-kept streets of Armon Hanatziv, the Israeli neighborhood across the street.  I see normal schools there,  said Mahmoud Awissat, a father of six from Jabel Mukhaber who drives a school bus in west Jerusalem.  It's worlds apart.   Jerusalem Mayor Nir Barkat acknowledges gaps in the quality of schools.  But we're catching up. We just took a loan of a billion shekels ($284 million) to build 1,000 classrooms, and half of that will be in East Jerusalem,  he told Reuters.

Data showing inflation in Germany, the biggest economy in the single currency bloc, edged up unexpectedly in June and stronger-than-expected inflation numbers in Spain helped send five-year German yields to their highest level since March 2016, adding to heavy selling across the region. That sell-off was sparked on Tuesday after comments from ECB chief Mario Draghi were seen as opening the door to monetary policy tweaks, fuelling market expectations that the central bank could announce a reduction in stimulus in September. ECB sources told Reuters on Wednesday that markets had over- interpreted Draghi's comments, allowing bond yields to pare some of their sharp increases. However, in a week during which Bank of England Governor Mark Carney has raised the spectre of an interest rate hike in Britain in the coming months, nervous investors stayed away from rate-sensitive bond markets. The U.S. Federal Reserve this month hiked rates for the second time in 2017, forecast one more hike this year and seemed to largely brush off recent mixed economic data.  First, we have to recognise that we are coming out of an extraordinary period where bond market yields were low and market volatility was squished - a backdrop that lends itself to an outburst of volatility,  said Peter Schaffrik, global macro strategist at RBC Capital Markets.  Secondly, the comments from the ECB come against a backdrop of a global move by central banks all pointing in the same direction.  Germany's 10-year bond yield jumped 9 basis points to 0.45 percent, hitting a six-week high after data for June showed German consumer prices rose by 1.5 percent on the year - higher than analysts had forecast. Five-year German bond yields rose as high as minus 0.23 percent, while 30-year bond yields also soared 8 basis points to a five-week high at 1.22 percent. Across the euro zone, bond yields were anywhere between 6 and 12 bps higher on the day, while U.S. and British bond yields also rose sharply . Time to Taper? With the euro zone economy rebounding and the ECB facing a scarcity of eligible bonds for its bond-buying stimulus, focus has turned to a  tapering  of the ECB's stimulus scheme even as the ECB tries to calm market expectations for a tighter policy. Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann said on Thursday he sees the current expansive monetary policy as appropriate.  Seeing the fall-out of Tuesday's speech from Draghi, ECB officials showed some effort to downplay the message,  analysts at ING said.  The 10-year Bund yield, consequently, dropped back somewhat, but the 'damage' has been done and yields have settled in the upper half of the year-to-date trading range.  Money markets price in a roughly 90 percent chance the ECB will lift interest rates by July 2018, a turnaround in rate-hike expectations from just a few weeks ago.  We are approaching the point where the ECB is going to have to discuss tapering as it's running out of eligible bonds to buy for the scheme,  said Commerzbank rates strategist Rainer Guntermann.  And Draghi has painted a scenario where there is a also fundamental reason for that if the ECB looks past recent subdued inflation data.

Critics charge that under Zuma, the ANC idealism and ethics epitomised by former president Nelson Mandela have been replaced by a relentless scramble for power, dividing the party and tarnishing the reputation of the post-apartheid  Rainbow Nation . Popular support has slumped. Zuma will be replaced as ANC leader at a national conference in December with Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa and former African Union chair and Zuma's ex-wife Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma widely viewed as frontrunners. The six-day conference beginning on Friday should offer clues to who may be in the ascendant.

We expect it to represent the real starting gun for factional alignments into December’s elective conference.  Zuma has drawn unprecedented criticism from senior ANC members in recent weeks. A shock cabinet reshuffle prompted ratings agencies to downgrade South Africa to  junk  status, the economy slid into recession and unemployment hit a 14-year high. The party is now split between factions broadly aligned to Dlamini-Zuma and Ramaphosa. Analysts mostly think the party will hold together, although a breakaway is possible should Dlamini-Zuma lose in December. Dlamini-Zuma's camp is expected to push for the expropriation of land without compensation and greater black ownership of businesses as part of a broader drive to defeat the  enemy  of  white monopoly capital . The government says only 8 million hectares of arable land has been transferred to black people since 1994, less than 10 percent of the 82 million hectares available and a third of the ANC's 30 percent target. Dlamini-Zuma's supporters also want to clip the wings of the central bank so that it focuses its mandate on growth, not inflation, and to reform the banking sector to promote black interests, including the creation of a state bank. Ramaphosa's supporters also prioritise wealth redistribution but believe the best strategy is through reforms that grow the economy, encourage investment, create jobs and tackle the corruption that has plagued the ANC under Zuma. Redistribution Many investors and ANC members in Ramaphosa's camp are concerned Dlamini-Zuma would continue in the mould of her ex-husband. She says opponents are trying to use her past to undermine her credibility. Ramaphosa has warned ANC members that if corruption and infighting rife under Zuma are not tackled, the party will be unable to arrest the decline that saw it lose control of major cities in local elections last year. An opposition coalition led by the Democratic Alliance, a traditionally white party that is becoming more inclusive, says it is confident of unseating the ANC at an election in 2019.  Cyril's main argument to grassroots ANC members is: if you don't choose me, the economy will collapse and we'll lose in 2019 and you'll have nothing,  a senior ANC source told Reuters.  The question is if he can win that ideological argument against an opponent with attractive populist policies and Zuma's well-established party patronage system.  Dlamini-Zuma, who has the support of Zuma and his powerful grassroots Zulu ANC support base, has accused her opponents of being 'anti-transformation' and too cosy with rich whites. A medical doctor and health minister under Mandela, Dlamini-Zuma has support in rural areas where Zuma is strong. Unionist-turned-business-mogul Ramaphosa has a more urban, middle-class constituency. Zuma has tried to temper fears over land reform, promising there will be no repeat of the chaos triggered by farm invasions in neighbouring Zimbabwe. Any changes would follow parliamentary procedure. A new charter raising the threshold for black ownership in mining companies was criticised by investors and industry players who said it was bullied through without consultation. Signs this month that the central bank's independence is in question have weakened the rand. Though few major policy changes are expected to be agreed at this week's meeting, the policy agenda will be watched for clues to whose voice - Ramaphosa's or Dlamini-Zuma's - feeds through more clearly in the language.  Leadership will play its part, even if it is an official no-go area,  political analyst Mcebisi Ndletyana said.  Even if there are no specifics, it will be interesting to see the language agreed. We may get some signals as to what is the dominant faction.  (Editing by Ralph Boulton)","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/safrica-politics-idUSL8N1JQ265"},

The media mogul’s 21st Century Fox offered concessions to protect the independence of Sky’s news arm in an attempt to secure UK government approval for its 11.7 billion pound bid for full control of the pay-TV company. Murdoch’s history of editorial meddling makes such pledges unconvincing. The 86-year-old and his family had hoped this time would be different. The clan withdrew an earlier bid for Sky after a phone-hacking scandal at some of its UK titles. Since then, Murdoch has separated his broadcasting assets from newspapers like the Sun and the Times. The rise of digital media has also arguably diluted his print influence. But because the Murdochs still own 39 percent of both Fox and News Corp, regulator Ofcom treated the two companies as a single entity, and concluded that taking full ownership of Sky could give the Murdoch empire the third-largest reach of any UK news provider. That would concentrate too much control over the country’s news media in the hands of one family. In an attempt to soothe those fears, Fox promised to establish an independent editorial board for Sky News and to carry on investing in the loss-making service for five years. Ofcom accepts that the proposed remedies should help to insulate the head of Sky News. The problem is that future appointments to the editorial board would be made by a sub-committee of Fox’s board of directors – hardly a guarantee of independence. Media Secretary Karen Bradley rejected the remedies, but might still wave through the deal if Fox comes back with revised measures before July 14. Investors are betting that is what will happen. Sky shares now trade just 8 percent shy of Fox’s offer, from 11 percent on Wednesday. Murdoch has paid little attention to such guarantees in the past, though. His 1981 bid for the Times and Sunday Times came with commitments “protecting the editorial quality and integrity” that were subsequently ignored. A Special Committee set up to protect the editorial integrity of the Wall Street Journal after Murdoch bought it in 2007 did not prevent him from replacing the newspaper’s managing editor a few months later. That track record undermines the credibility of the latest concessions. The government should ignore them and trigger a full review of the deal by the UK competition authorities.BreakingviewsReuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

The euro jetted to $1.1434, its highest since May 11, 2016, with European Central Bank sources' attempt on Wednesday to moderate the message from Tuesday's speech by President Mario Draghi falling largely on deaf ears. The speech convinced markets that the central bank was preparing to start withdrawing its own emergency stimulus for the euro zone economy later this year. Meanwhile, comments from Bank of England Governor Mark Carney and two top Bank of Canada policymakers on Wednesday ramped up expectations for interest rate increases from those central banks.  The shifting monetary policy trajectories of other central banks is making other currencies more attractive relative to the U.S. dollar,  said Kathy Lien, managing director at BK Asset Management in New York. The euro was last 0.4 percent higher against the dollar at $1.1424. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was down 0.3 percent at 95.727 after touching a roughly nine-month low of 95.685. Analysts also said lingering doubts among traders that the Fed would be able to raise interest rates again this year hurt the dollar, which is expected to benefit from such increases.  The market is a little skeptical about the Fed outlook for another rate hike this year,  said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington. Esiner said that skepticism, combined with the more hawkish signals from other central banks, hurt the dollar because it disrupted expectations held since mid-2014 that the Fed would become less accommodative before several other central banks. The greenback touched a roughly five-month low of C$1.2987 against the Canadian dollar and last traded down 0.3 percent at $1.2994. The dollar hit a more than one-month high of 112.92 yen before easing from that level to trade up just 0.1 percent against the Japanese currency at 112.37.

RBI set out plans on Thursday to sell the stake to meet a deadline set by Poland's financial market regulator, which wants to increase transparency and local ownership of banks. But the IPO comes at a difficult time for Raiffeisen Bank Polska, also known as Raiffeisen Polbank, as the lender has a portfolio of troublesome Swiss franc mortgages and its net loss rose more than sevenfold in the first quarter. Two fund managers said that Raiffeisen Polbank's IPO price range has been set at 25.5-28 zlotys per share, both adding that investors will find it too high. Several fund managers and investment bankers contacted by Reuters earlier on Thursday said they were sceptical about the IPO's success, with some expressing doubts it could be completed at all.  Raiffeisen does not want to sell the stake at a price lower than book value, while investors are unwilling to pay that much,  said a Warsaw-based fund manager. Another source said investors were unlikely to buy Raiffeisen Polbank's shares if they were priced at more than 0.4 times book value. Earlier this year, RBI put the book value of its Polish business at about 1.4 billion euros ($1.6 billion), equivalent to 6.2 euros or about 26 zlotys per share. The shares will be offered only to institutional investors. Book building will start on Thursday and last until July 6, when the share price is due to be published, according to the prospectus for the IPO. Trading on the Warsaw bourse is planned to start on about July 19. The prospectus lists a number of reasons why the IPO could be scrapped, including insufficient demand for the shares or an unsatisfactory price. It is not clear how Polish financial regulator KNF would respond to any cancellation of the IPO. The KNF was not immediately available to comment, while RBI and Raiffeisen Polbank both declined to comment on prospects for the IPO.  If the IPO fails, I'd expect a kind of compromise between RBI and the regulator,  said one Poland-based analyst. RBI previously convinced KNF to allow the IPO to be postponed by a year until June 30, 2017. Earlier this year, RBI sought a further delay, but the KNF refused. Since buying Polbank and merging it with its local operations, the profitability of Raiffeisen's Polish banking unit, now Poland's 10th lender by assets, has worsened, partly due to a bank asset tax introduced last year, analysts said. A portfolio of Swiss franc denominated loans has also hurt the lender's profitability and is forcing it to put aside more capital as required by new regulations. Seeking to make the IPO more attractive, Raiffeisen Polbank began a cost-cutting plan this year, including layoffs and branch closures. The prospectus showed RBI plans to sign a deal with Citigroup Global Markets Limited that will oblige the latter under certain conditions to buy Raiffeisen Polbank shares that are not purchased by institutional investors.

Media Secretary Karen Bradley said she was persuaded that Twenty-First Century Fox's (FOXA.O) bid could give the Murdoch family excessive influence over the media, after regulator Ofcom assessed the impact of the deal.   The proposed entity would have the third largest total reach of any news provider - lower only than the BBC and ITN - and would, uniquely, span news coverage on television, radio, in newspapers and online,  Bradley said. The Media Secretary said she would take a final decision on July 14, giving Fox two weeks to address her concerns. Shares in Sky rose on hopes a full investigation could still be averted by concessions over its 24-hour TV news channel.  Murdoch, 86, and his family have long coveted full control of Sky, despite the damaging failure of a previous attempt in 2011 when their British newspaper business became embroiled in a phone-hacking scandal which forced them to abandon that bid. A public inquiry into the affair revealed deep ties between Murdoch and the political establishment, making the renewed bid potentially toxic for Prime Minister Theresa May's government which is fighting for survival after losing its majority. Bradley had asked regulators to examine whether Fox would have too much control of the media, and whether it would be committed to upholding broadcasting standards if allowed to buy the company which broadcasts in Britain, Ireland, Germany, Austria and Italy.  Fox said it was disappointed by the government's rejection of its plans to maintain editorial independence of Sky News, and said a full investigation could push the deal's completion date back to next June.  We will continue to work constructively with the UK authorities,  it said.  During the previous takeover attempt Murdoch proposed spinning off Sky News into a separate company. However, Ofcom said on Thursday it was concerned that separating Sky News could be counter-productive, given the potential difficulties in funding the service outside of the Sky structure.

Britain's political leaders have long sought the backing of Murdoch and his Times and Sun newspapers, sparking accusations that he uses his media empire to play puppet master in the corridors of power.  Tom Watson, deputy leader of the opposition Labour Party and a long-standing Murdoch critic, said the government was going through the motions and would ultimately approve the deal.

The regulator said allegations of sexual and racial harassment at Fox News in the U.S. were extremely serious and disturbing but had found no clear evidence to suggest senior executives at Fox were aware of the misconduct. Fox tried to pre-empt government concerns over the impact on Sky's editorial independence by proposing the creation of an independent board to run Sky News, the company's influential 24-hour news channel.

We cannot allow them (aid workers) to go and then be hit by wrong elements against peace and then the government will be blamed,  said the spokesman, Ateny Wek Ateny.   It is about safety for the humanitarians. It is to be coordinated, and the government can only clear the humanitarian workers when it is safe.  South Sudan's four-year-old civil war has killed tens of thousands of people and displaced more than three million. Earlier this year, the U.N. briefly declared a famine in the northern rebel stronghold of Unity state. Ateny's comments follow U.N. complaints that the government has blocked aid deliveries to rebel-held areas in the southern Equatoria region over the last two months, but allowed aid to reach government-held towns. Since May, four aid convoys were prevented from reaching 30,000 displaced civilians in rebel-held areas in Central Equatoria state's Kajo Keji county, the U.N. Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said in a statement on Wednesday.  Authorities also restricted relief groups from rural areas around Torit town in Eastern Equatoria state, OCHA said. Both counties face  emergency  levels of food insecurity, one step below famine, according this month's report from the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification system (IPC), a government-led statistical body. In Western Equatoria, aid groups were denied access to the rebel-held villages Kotobi and Bangolo, the U.N. said.  But aid deliveries have reached government-controlled towns, OCHA noted. South Sudan's government holds most major towns in Equatoria and the rebels are in the countryside. Aid groups are mostly based in the government-controlled capital, Juba. Kenyi Erastus Michael, the rebel-appointed commissioner in Kajo Keji county, urged aid groups to send relief from neighboring Uganda, which borders rebel-held areas, instead of trying to send convoys across front lines from Juba.  Humanitarian agencies ...want to bring their things from their main stores in Juba with permission from the government, and then it is the government sabotaging it,  Michael said by phone. South Sudan's civil war is one of the world's most dangerous for aid workers. At least 79 have been killed since the start of the civil war, including six in a single attack in March.

Media Secretary Karen Bradley said she was persuaded that Twenty-First Century Fox's (FOXA.O) bid could give the Murdoch family excessive influence over the media, after regulator Ofcom assessed the impact of the deal.   The proposed entity would have the third largest total reach of any news provider - lower only than the BBC and ITN - and would, uniquely, span news coverage on television, radio, in newspapers and online,  Bradley said. The Media Secretary said she would take a final decision on July 14, giving Fox two weeks to address her concerns. Shares in Sky rose on hopes a full investigation could still be averted by concessions over its 24-hour TV news channel.  Murdoch, 86, and his family have long coveted full control of Sky, despite the damaging failure of a previous attempt in 2011 when their British newspaper business became embroiled in a phone-hacking scandal which forced them to abandon that bid. A public inquiry into the affair revealed deep ties between Murdoch and the political establishment, making the renewed bid potentially toxic for Prime Minister Theresa May's government which is fighting for survival after losing its majority. Bradley had asked regulators to examine whether Fox would have too much control of the media, and whether it would be committed to upholding broadcasting standards if allowed to buy the company which broadcasts in Britain, Ireland, Germany, Austria and Italy.  Fox said it was disappointed by the government's rejection of its plans to maintain editorial independence of Sky News, and said a full investigation could push the deal's completion date back to next June.  We will continue to work constructively with the UK authorities,  it said.  During the previous takeover attempt Murdoch proposed spinning off Sky News into a separate company. However, Ofcom said on Thursday it was concerned that separating Sky News could be counter-productive, given the potential difficulties in funding the service outside of the Sky structure.

Yet despite having a flourishing business he does not pay any tax. Until now, his rundown premises and small scale operation has kept the business below the radar of India's tax officials. Come July 1, however,  the party will be over , says the 51-year-old, with a resigned shrug. A nationwide Goods and Services Tax (GST), set to come into effect on Saturday, has faced criticism for its complex design. But the country's biggest tax reform since independence is promising to bring millions of firms like Sachdeva's into the tax net, boosting government revenues and India's sovereign credit profile. The new tax will require firms to upload their invoices every month to a portal that will match them with those of their suppliers or vendors. Because a tax number is needed for a firm to claim a credit on the cost of its inputs, many companies are refusing to buy from unregistered businesses. Those who don't sign up risk losing any customer who has.  I have no option, but to register with the new system,  said Sachdeva, who spoke to Reuters on condition the name and precise location of his shop were not disclosed.  Boosting the Coffers Improved tax compliance should shore up public finances, augmenting resources for welfare and development spending and giving a lift to the $2 trillion economy. India currently has one of the worst tax-to-GDP ratios among major economies at 16.6 percent, less the half the 34 percent average for the members of the OECD and also below many emerging economies. While there is no official estimate of the potential fiscal gain, some tax experts say the measure, after the initial teething trouble, would lift the tax-to-GDP ratio by as much as 4 percentage points as the number of tax filers is estimated to more than treble to 30 million.  In future, compliance is going to be extremely crucial,  Rajiv Nair, chief executive officer at Kaya Ltd. (KAYA.NS), told Reuters.  Since we are also responsible for compliance across the supply chain, we have to ensure that the suppliers we have are in a position to work with us in a compliant manner.  Nair's company, which makes beauty and personal care products, has just streamlined its supply chain, dropping vendors that were not going to be GST-compliant. Other companies are doing the same. Elior Group (ELIOR.PA), a French catering and food service company, said it has mandated GST-compliance as one of the eligibility criteria for its orders. Winners and Losers The unorganized sector of India's economy is vast, employing an estimated nine out of 10 workers. While staying outside the GST regime risks losing business, joining it will necessitate an overhaul of firms' accounting systems and an investment in technology.   The new tax system requires three filing a month plus an annual return - a total of 37 filings - for each of India's 29 states in which a firm operates. For smaller companies operating on wafer thin margins, hiring accountants and technical staff could substantially dent their bottom line. Sanjiv Mehra, head of a traders' body in Delhi, reckons a  prohibitive  cost could prove to be counterproductive.  Compliance is needed for input tax credit,  he said.  But what if you are in a business where margins are strong and allows you to forsake credit?  But despite its flaws, many analysts think the new tax will be good news for bigger established businesses, because it will sweep away an array of federal and state sales taxes, levied at different stages of the supply chain, that often result in double taxation. The government estimates the GST will save companies around $14 billion because it will allow them to organize their warehouses and supply chains more efficiently. Firms can now move to demand-based  hub-and-spoke  models used globally, rather than operating state-by-state.  Those companies which can wring out the maximum cost efficiency are the ones investors should bet on,  said Ajay Bodke, head of portfolio management services at financial firm Prabhudas Lilladher in Mumbai.  All consumer-facing industries will be big beneficiaries of the GST.

Nemtsov, one of President Vladimir Putin's most vocal critics, was murdered in 2015 as he walked across a bridge near the Kremlin after dining with his girlfriend. Aged 55, he had been working on a report examining Russia's role in Ukraine. His killing sent a chill through opposition circles. After more than eight months of hearings, a jury trial convicted five ethnic Chechen men of his murder, including the man prosecutors said pulled the trigger, Zaur Dadayev, a former soldier in Chechnya. The court said the four others had acted as his accomplices and that the group had been promised a bounty of 15 million rubles ($253,889.59) for the high-profile assassination. Nemtsov's supporters gave a muted welcome to the verdict, but said Dadayev and the others were only low-level operatives. The case remained unsolved, they said, because those who had ordered, financed and organized the hit had not been caught.  It's the biggest crime of the century and yet they haven't identified the real organizers or those who ordered it,  Vadim Prokhorov, a lawyer for the late politician's daughter, told reporters after the verdict.   The Russian government was not prepared to look into the entourage of (Chechen leader Ramzan) Kadyrov,  he said, despite his view that one of the masterminds was a close associate of the Chechen strongman.  Zhanna Nemtsova, the slain politician's daughter, repeatedly said she wanted Kadyrov, the Kremlin-backed head of Chechnya who calls himself  Putin's footsoldier , to be questioned about what he knew about the case. Kadyrov has praised the trigger man Dadayev as a  true patriot of Russia . Kadyrov, who has denied allegations he was personally involved, was never summoned by the court. Nemtsova said she was disappointed but not surprised that her father's murder case remained unsolved.   Clearly, investigators and the court did not strive to establish the truth,  Nemtsova said in a statement on social media.  It was of course not a proper investigation, but only an imitation of one.     Blame Goes 'Straight to the Top' The Kremlin, as it did when journalist Anna Politkovskaya was murdered in 2006, has downplayed Nemtsov's significance, calling his killing a  provocation  designed to cause problems for the Russian authorities. Tamerlan Eskerkhanov, who is suspected of involvement in the killing of opposition figure Boris Nemtsov, stands inside a glass-walled cage during their trial at the Moscow military district court, Russia June 27, 2017.Sergei KarpukhinDmitry Peskov, President Vladimir Putin's spokesman, said after the verdict it was up to investigators to decide if further examination of the case was necessary. Before the verdict, Peskov had said it was  an extraordinarily complex case  and that it sometimes took years to identify and arrest the masterminds in such cases. Investigators have said they are still seeking a man they suspect of having helped organize the killing. Nemtsova said she saw no willingness on the authorities' part to pursue the case.   Her father, a former deputy prime minister who was once tipped to succeed Boris Yeltsin as president, a job Putin got, had authored an excoriating report on Putin's rule. Shortly before he was killed, he had been working on a report examining the Russian military's role in Ukraine. Kremlin critics say the trial was flawed. The authorities never made public any CCTV footage of the killing despite it taking place in sight of the Kremlin's walls. Slideshow (3 Images)A murder weapon was never recovered, and many witnesses were never summoned. One of the main suspects was also killed - in unclear circumstances - when authorities tried to detain him in Chechnya.   Olga Mikhailova, a lawyer for Nemtsova, said during the trial that Nemtsov had been a major irritant to the authorities.   We are absolutely convinced, considering how the murder was organized and carried out, that the roots of the killing go straight to top Russian and Chechen officials,  she said. Ilya Yashin, Nemtsov's one-time spokesman, said he and other supporters would now try to pressure the authorities into pursuing the people who were really behind the murder.             Nemtsov's memory is kept alive in central Moscow where, for more than 700 days and nights, a small group of anti-Kremlin activists has guarded a makeshift memorial to him on the bridge opposite Moscow's Red Square where he was gunned down. The city authorities have dismantled the memorial several times, but each time activists have rebuilt it. The five Chechen men will be sentenced by the court at a later date. A lawyer for at least one of them said he would appeal. Nemtsova said she would not rest until the case was solved.   We will fight on to find out the full truth using all means at our disposal,  she said.

Kenya relies heavily on geothermal and hydro power for its electricity, providing the bulk of the country's total 2,341 MW output. Wind power provides about 25 MW. The construction of the 266-mile (428-km), 400-kilovolt power line from the Lake Turkana Wind Power project, running from Loiyangalani in the north to Suswa in the center, started in November 2015 and had been due to be completed by December.        Danish wind turbine maker Vestas Wind Systems, supplier of the wind farm's 365 turbines, said this month the wind farm was ready for launch but would be idle until next year as the government had not yet installed the transmission line. Energy and Petroleum Cabinet Secretary Charles Keter said on Thursday work was under way to get all required material for local subcontractors as Spain's Grupo Isolux Corsan [GCFB.UL], the main contractor, was having financial difficulties.  We saw the need that instead of us terminating the contract, we'd rather manage by getting the materials because the subcontractors who are working on the line are Kenyans,  Keter told a news conference.  If we get the materials within the next three months, we should complete the line from Lake Turkana all the way to Suswa,  he said. The Lake Turkana consortium consists of KP&P; Africa, Aldwych International, Investment Fund for Developing Countries, Finnish Fund for Industrial Cooperation, Norwegian Investment Fund for Developing Countries, Sandpiper and Vestas.

Until then at least, stock and bonds had again been trading higher on the premise that the total pot of global liquidity was still swelling despite rising Federal Reserve rates - courtesy of ongoing European Central Bank and Bank of Japan bond buying programs, most of all.  That's why Mario Draghi's apparent change of tack on Tuesday had such an impact on every global asset from Wall Street to London and Tokyo - far more than any of the latest Fed utterances.  German Bund yields DE10YT=TWEB, a proxy for core Europe's borrowing costs, doubled, spreads between U.S. debt and almost everywhere else tightened, and a number of big banks declared the dollar rally dead as the euro EUR= put it to the sword. SEB investment management's head of asset allocation, Hans Peterson, said the central banks and their ultra-accommodative policies were  slowly, slowly, slowly turning .   It remains to be seen how markets react longer-term,  he added.  The thing is, we have a whole generation of investment managers and people in the markets that have never lived without central bank support.  Suddenly, the usual central bank noise has suddenly harmonized over what the Bank for International Settlements - where dozens of central bankers met at the weekend - called the  great unwinding  of easy money. Hours after Draghi spoke, U.S. Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen was warning of high asset price valuations, a colleague was talking about putting its balance sheet on  autopilot , and Bank of England Governor Mark Carney had pirouetted from saying that now was not the time to think about rate hikes to saying they would soon have to be discussed. Despite the initial knee-jerk moves, markets remained relatively cautious, wary that subdued global inflation and wage growth - which policymakers openly admit they are struggling to understand - will delay their reactions. A Bank of England rate hike is now 80 percent priced-in by March next year, and Canada is at 70 percent after talk of rate rises there too this week. But traders are still not banking on another Fed rate rise in the next 12 months, and the ECB is not expected to raise rates in that timeframe either, even if privately some of its hawkish members say it could. Pulling Out the Plug Between them, the Fed, the ECB, the BoE and the Bank of Japan have hoovered up almost $15 trillion of bonds over the last eight years, roughly three-quarters of what the U.S. economy is worth. The current rate of accumulation is still almost $200 billion a month, split almost equally between the ECB and BOJ. Even if $50 billion was lopped off in the next six months or so as the Fed trims its balance sheet, it will all be carefully managed. Therefore the assumption is that there won't be a meaningful reduction in liquidity for at least a year.   The sink will be broadly as full as it has been, even with the plug gradually being removed,  said Neil Williams, chief economist of UK fund manager Hermes. The banks will be all too aware that, despite all their cheap money, a decade on from the big credit crash, economies remain highly indebted. Global debt levels have climbed $500 billion in the past year alone to a record $217 trillion, one of the most authoritative trackers of global capital flows, the Institute of International Finance (IIF), said this week. It adds up to 327 percent of the world's annual economic output. The IIF warned of  rollover  risks in store, especially in emerging markets, where $1.9 trillion will have matured by the end of 2018. SEB's Peterson thinks equities will be the place to be as rates rise, but that any sign of corporate borrowing costs starting to rise away from official interest rates should be seen as a warning.  The difference between the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield and the average on Barclays' corporate bond index is currently just 0.3 percentage points - 2.2 compared to 2.5 percent - virtually the lowest in three years.

The two parties have each committed an initial US$100m in equity capital, according to a June 22 regulatory filing. The fund, structured as a 50-50 joint venture between Owl Rock Capital Corp, one of the firm’s two business development companies (BDCs), and Regents, the governing board of the University of California system, is expected to invest in senior secured loans that are made to middle market companies or in broadly syndicated loans. BDCs are specialized investment funds that lend to US mid-sized companies. Funds include both publicly traded vehicles with shares listed on an exchange as well as private unlisted vehicles. The off balance sheet vehicle will allow Owl Rock Capital Corp to employ additional leverage beyond the one-to-one total debt to equity cap for BDCs. Such off balance sheet investment strategies have been used by BDCs as a means to enhance portfolio returns when investing in a lower yielding environment. BDC managers have used joint ventures of varying strategies, not only to boost yields, but also as a means to increase scale, commit larger amounts of capital and invest in bigger transactions. Ares Capital Corp, the largest BDC by market capitalization and total assets, and asset manager Varagon Capital Partners announced the Senior Direct Lending Program joint venture in 2015. Regents also entered into a joint venture with Goldman Sachs BDC in 2014, according to regulatory filings. Lenders to middle market businesses, including BDCs, as well as commercial finance companies and other direct lending platforms, have seen asset spreads erode as institutional investors chasing yield have increasingly turned to middle market loans. Middle market institutional term loan yields have declined for three consecutive quarters to 6.22% in the most recent three-month period, Thomson Reuters LPC data show. This year through June 27, LPC has tracked approximately US$28.6bn in total middle market fundraising, including capital allocated to debt funds and separately managed accounts, as well as BDC equity raises and middle market collateralized loan obligations. This follows a total of US$59bn raised last year for middle market lending strategies. New loan supply has not kept pace with demand and existing portfolio companies have also sought to take advantage of investor appetite to slash borrowing rates, leaving lenders to deploy repayments at lower yields. Regents had previously invested in Owl Rock, according to regulatory filings. An Owl Rock spokesperson declined to comment. A spokesperson for Regents did not return a telephone call or e-mails seeking comment. Owl Rock was founded by Douglas Ostrover, a founder of GSO Capital Partners, Blackstone Group’s credit investment unit, Marc Lipschultz, a former global head of energy and infrastructure at KKR, and Craig Packer, a former co-head of leveraged finance in the Americas at Goldman Sachs. Owl Rock Capital Corp made its first portfolio company investment in April 2016 and as of March 31 its portfolio consisted of 60.7% first-lien debt investments and 39.3% second-lien debt investments, according to a May 10 regulatory filing. Between April 1, 2017 and June 16, 2017, Owl Rock funded US$629.7m in commitments in new portfolio companies, according to a June regulatory filing. New portfolio investments include travel document services provider CIBT Global Inc, power tool manufacturer Blount International, food service disposables distributor Dade Paper & Bag and veterinary hospital operator PetVet Care Centers.

The film is the first time that Spider-Man, one of Disney-owned Marvel's most popular characters, is the lead in a film set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.  Kevin Feige, the president of Marvel Studios, championed the cause of getting Spider-Man into the Disney-run sphere.  Now we have the first time Spider-Man in the Marvel Universe where he belongs,  he stated at the premiere, adding  I sort of am still pinching myself. I can't believe it. I can't believe we're premiering the movie tonight and I can't wait for people to see it.

Yet despite having a flourishing business he does not pay any tax. Until now, his rundown premises and small scale operation has kept the business below the radar of India's tax officials. Come July 1, however,  the party will be over , says the 51-year-old, with a resigned shrug. A nationwide Goods and Services Tax (GST), set to come into effect on Saturday, has faced criticism for its complex design. But the country's biggest tax reform since independence is promising to bring millions of firms like Sachdeva's into the tax net, boosting government revenues and India's sovereign credit profile. The new tax will require firms to upload their invoices every month to a portal that will match them with those of their suppliers or vendors. Because a tax number is needed for a firm to claim a credit on the cost of its inputs, many companies are refusing to buy from unregistered businesses. Those who don't sign up risk losing any customer who has.  I have no option, but to register with the new system,  said Sachdeva, who spoke to Reuters on condition the name and precise location of his shop were not disclosed.  Boosting the Coffers Improved tax compliance should shore up public finances, augmenting resources for welfare and development spending and giving a lift to the $2 trillion economy. India currently has one of the worst tax-to-GDP ratios among major economies at 16.6 percent, less the half the 34 percent average for the members of the OECD and also below many emerging economies. While there is no official estimate of the potential fiscal gain, some tax experts say the measure, after the initial teething trouble, would lift the tax-to-GDP ratio by as much as 4 percentage points as the number of tax filers is estimated to more than treble to 30 million.  In future, compliance is going to be extremely crucial,  Rajiv Nair, chief executive officer at Kaya Ltd. (KAYA.NS), told Reuters.  Since we are also responsible for compliance across the supply chain, we have to ensure that the suppliers we have are in a position to work with us in a compliant manner.  Nair's company, which makes beauty and personal care products, has just streamlined its supply chain, dropping vendors that were not going to be GST-compliant. Other companies are doing the same. Elior Group (ELIOR.PA), a French catering and food service company, said it has mandated GST-compliance as one of the eligibility criteria for its orders. Winners and Losers The unorganized sector of India's economy is vast, employing an estimated nine out of 10 workers. While staying outside the GST regime risks losing business, joining it will necessitate an overhaul of firms' accounting systems and an investment in technology.   The new tax system requires three filing a month plus an annual return - a total of 37 filings - for each of India's 29 states in which a firm operates. For smaller companies operating on wafer thin margins, hiring accountants and technical staff could substantially dent their bottom line. Sanjiv Mehra, head of a traders' body in Delhi, reckons a  prohibitive  cost could prove to be counterproductive.  Compliance is needed for input tax credit,  he said.  But what if you are in a business where margins are strong and allows you to forsake credit?  But despite its flaws, many analysts think the new tax will be good news for bigger established businesses, because it will sweep away an array of federal and state sales taxes, levied at different stages of the supply chain, that often result in double taxation. The government estimates the GST will save companies around $14 billion because it will allow them to organize their warehouses and supply chains more efficiently. Firms can now move to demand-based  hub-and-spoke  models used globally, rather than operating state-by-state.  Those companies which can wring out the maximum cost efficiency are the ones investors should bet on,  said Ajay Bodke, head of portfolio management services at financial firm Prabhudas Lilladher in Mumbai.  All consumer-facing industries will be big beneficiaries of the GST.

Tech stocks, which have led the S&P; 500's record run this year, pulled back recently after some investors questioned the sector's high valuations and shifted to defensive sectors. The S&P; tech index led the laggards among the 11 sectors, with the index on track to post its biggest monthly loss in a year. Apple, which fell 1.2 percent, was the biggest drag on all the three major indexes, while Alphabet and Microsoft were among the top three drags on the Nasdaq and the S&P.; However, the financial sector, which rose 1.29 percent, limited the slide. Shares of the top six U.S. banks rose after the Federal Reserve cleared them in the second part of its annual stress test, allowing them to raise dividend payouts and share buybacks.  Part of the reason why tech is down today is the steam in the recent rotation out of some of big tech winners and into banks,  said Michael Scanlon, portfolio manager at Manulife Asset Management in Boston.  The catalyst for that rotation today is the really strong stress test results coupled with higher treasury rates this morning and a positive GDP revision, leading investors to move into financial which has underperformed this year.  The financial index has grown 6.6 percent this year, underperforming the 9 percent rise in the S&P.; At 10:54 a.m. ET (1454 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 32.17 points, or 0.15 percent, at 21,422.44, the S&P; 500 was down 7.3 points, or 0.29 percent, at 2,433.39. The Nasdaq Composite was down 54.77 points, or 0.88 percent, at 6,179.65. Earlier in the day, data showed the U.S. economy slowed less sharply in the first quarter than initially estimated due to unexpectedly higher consumer spending and a bigger jump in exports. Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yields rose to five-week highs in sympathy with weaker European government debt, as investors evaluated the likelihood that central banks in Europe will soon become less accommodative. Oil prices rose to a two-week high, extending the rally into the sixth straight session, after a decline in weekly U.S. production eased concerns about deepening oversupply. The energy sector was among the two gainers on the S&P;, rising 0.89 percent. Among stocks, Rite Aid slumped 24.5 percent after Walgreens Boots Alliance terminated its agreement to buy the drug store chain and said it would instead buy nearly half of its stores for $5.18 billion.

But now there seems to be an olive branch from Paris. The U.S. leader said on Wednesday he had accepted an invitation from Emmanuel Macron to celebrate July 14 Bastille Day celebrations and 100 years since the U.S. troops entered into World War One. Trump will likely revel in a ceremony laden with pageantry and military pomp, with U.S. soldiers marching down the Champs Elysees boulevard beside French servicemen - a welcome respite from his domestic woes. For Macron, 39, it is an opportunity to use soft diplomacy to win Trump's confidence as he tries to establish himself as a leading global statesman at a time when decision-making in the White House has become increasingly unpredictable.  We don't want the United States to isolate themselves,  a Macron aide said recently.  That's what diplomacy is for. It's not to let people sulk in their corner.  In the space of six weeks, France's youngest leader since Napoleon, will have hosted Russian President Vladimir Putin in Versailles and Trump on Paris' most iconic avenue. Macron flattered Putin in May with a meeting at the sumptuous palace of France's former monarchy, built outside Paris by Louis XIV - the 'Sun King' - to symbolize absolute power. Even so, Macron pulled no punches, accusing Russian state media of  lying propaganda  during his French election campaign. A French diplomat indicated there would be frank exchanges with Trump too after Macron took a dig in English at Trump's withdrawal from the Paris climate accord when he urged U.S. citizens to help  make this planet great again .  On climate change it's complicated,  the diplomat said.  But the rest is sufficiently important for him to make this historic trip on July 14.   France Is No Longer France  Macron appears to be broadly aligning his foreign policy with U.S. priorities of tackling terrorism while seeking better ties with Russia. The battle against Islamic State, Syria's civil war and Iran's nuclear accord are likely talking points. Privately, some French diplomats have lamented the lack of a clear U.S. policy on the long-term political process in Syria and say even setting up a meeting between the French and U.S. foreign ministers is tough.  A White House statement said the two leaders would  further build on the strong counter-terrorism cooperation and economic partnership between the two countries . Past words may haunt Trump. It will be his first visit since he declared that a wave of militant attacks showed France was soft on immigration and fighting jihadists.   France is no longer France. They won't like me for saying that but... France is no longer France and this world better be very careful and they better get very tough and very smart,  the U.S. president said in a campaign speech.  In bringing Trump to Paris, Macron has stolen a march on Britain's embattled Prime Minister Theresa May.      London's offer in February of a state visit for Trump met fierce public resistance, Britons perceiving it as a desperate act by a government in need of a trade deal as it faced tough negotiations on its exit from the European Union. A date has still not been confirmed. In Paris, public opinion appeared divided.  You can see that the way Trump's headed isn't going to help things and I think diplomatic channels are the best way to calm things down,  said antique dealer Florence Toussaint.

Foes of Venezuelan socialist President Nicolas Maduro are holding public showings of Netflix's  Winter on Fire  documentary about the three-month standoff in Ukraine that led to 100 deaths and the exit of then-president Viktor Yanukovich. In Venezuela's anti-government unrest, where 80 people have died since April, youths bear colorfully decorated homemade shields akin to those used in Kiev's Maidan Square. The young Venezuelans make their shields from satellite TV dishes, drain covers, barrels or any other scraps of wood and metal they can find. Some supporters also make and donate shields. The protesters use the shields to form walls, or even beat on them in unison, as Roman soldiers and Norsemen used to do going into battle. Fellow demonstrators cheer as the self-styled  Resistance  members link arms to walk to the front lines and face off with National Guard troops and police.  The shields don't stop bullets, but they do protect us from tear gas, rubber bullets and stones,  said 20-year-old law student Brian Suarez, wearing a gas mask and carrying a shield depicting Maduro in the sights of a rifle target.  Other shields carry quotes and images of Venezuela's constitution, paintings and religious symbols, depictions of the faces of slain protesters, or slogans saying  SOS! ,  No More Dictatorship!  or  Murderer, Maduro!  While the protesters say they are fighting against tyranny in the South American oil producer, Maduro accuses them of seeking a violent coup with U.S. support.  Manuel Melo said he was on the front line of protests, hurling stones and protecting other marchers with his blue plastic shield, until one day he was caught by a water cannon. The 20-year-old graphic design student lost his kidney from the impact.   Nevertheless, he wants to go back.  It's an important role being a shield-bearer because you know that everything they throw goes straight at you,  he said while recovering from his home in Caracas.  I'm not out there because I like it, but for the common good.   Am I in Ukraine?  A demonstrator holding a rudimentary shield and a tennis racket poses for a picture before a rally against Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's government in Caracas, Venezuela, May 27, 2017. He said:  I protest for the future of my country. Carlos Garcia Rawlins Winter on Fire,  by Russian director Evgeny Afineevsky, shows tens of thousands of Ukrainian protesters braving snow and baton attacks from riot police to barricade themselves in Maidan Square. It has been discreetly shown around Venezuela, including at bookshops, a university, a public square and an arts cinema.  Forums and discussions are held afterward.  Hearing a Ukrainian and seeing the tears in their eyes, you ask yourself: 'Hold on, am I in Ukraine or in Cafetal?'  said university professor Carlos Delgado, referring to an upper-class part of Caracas that has vigorously supported the protests.  Slideshow (11 Images)Delgado, 48, recently participated in a screening and forum about  Winter on Fire  at Venezuela's Catholic University, where opposition to Maduro is also strong.  Many have also spread the word on social media.   This documentary is unmissable,  Venezuelan actress and author Ana Maria Simon exhorted on her Instagram account.  All Venezuelans should see it, especially those who are tired, especially those close to losing faith.  In both countries, protesters have opposed presidents they consider repressive, and the clashes turned increasingly violent. But differences abound, too.  While Ukraine's protesters endured freezing conditions day and night, Venezuela's thin out quickly when rain starts, and they go home in the evening and enjoy balmy Caribbean weather.  The Venezuelans point out that criminal gangs make the streets dangerous at night. And with their economy in meltdown, they are often short of medicine, food and other needs, whereas the Ukrainians had a good supply line.   Hans Wuerich, who became famous for stripping in front of an armored car with a Bible in Caracas, said  Winter on Fire  made him think Venezuela's Resistance needed to escalate tactics.   It's time to take the protests to another level,  the 27-year-old reporter said in Caracas' Altamira Square, a focus of the demonstrations.  But we need to be organized if we're going to take the streets day and night, if it's really about a point of no return.

Fuel price increases had been widely anticipated as part of Egypt's loan accord with the International Monetary Fund and Thursday's measures were the second rise since the government floated the pound currency in November. Government officials say spending cuts will help revive an economy where subsidies have accounted for about a quarter of state expenditures. But austerity carries risks for Sisi as inflation and a contested deal to hand two Red Sea islands to Saudi Arabia have eroded his public standing. Prime Minister Sherif Ismail told reporters after the announcement that officials would monitor market prices, adding:  We will not allow any greed and exploitation of our citizens.  Petroleum Minister Tarek El Molla told Reuters the price of 92-octane gasoline had been put up by more than 40 percent to 5 Egyptian pounds ($0.2767) from 3.5 pounds per litre. Diesel and 80-octane - the most commonly used fuel categories - rose more than 50 percent to 3.65 pounds per litre from 2.35 pounds. The government also increased the price of cooking gas cylinders - used mostly by poorer Egyptians - by 100 percent to 30 pounds ($1.66) from 15 pounds per cylinder. Molla said the total subsidies for petroleum products in 2017-2018 would fall to 110 billion Egyptian pounds ($6.09 billion) from 145 billion pounds ($8.02 billion). Fuel oil prices to cement factories will rise by 40 percent to 3,500 Egyptian pounds per tonne from 2,500 pounds a tonne, but gas prices to the industrial sector will remain stable, Molla said. Last year, the government embarked on an ambitious reform programme to revive the economy that includes lifting subsidies, raising taxes and loosening capital controls as part of a three-year IMF agreement. Foreign Investors, Tourists Egypt has been struggling since a 2011 uprising drove foreign investors and tourists away, and many Egyptians have been hit hard by record inflation and a local currency that has lost half its value since it was floated in November. In December, Sisi said that tough economic conditions in Egypt would improve in six months. But for many Egyptians, conditions have deteriorated.  It's completely the wrong timing. People can't take it anymore, all prices will increase,  Cairo taxi driver Ehab Labib said of the fuel hike.  I will sell this taxi, what else am I going to do?  Government officials say short-term austerity under the IMF plan will free up more financing for infrastructure and help draw foreign investment to help create jobs and economic growth. Egypt is expected to receive the second IMF loan instalment of $1.25 billion within the coming few weeks. The central bank floated the pound last November as part of reforms agreed with the IMF. At that time, the government increased fuel prices by as much as 46 percent. Egyptian businessmen worry that they will have to bear the extra costs of Thursday's move and say they have not yet fully recovered from the impact of austerity measures taken over the past eight months.  My expectation is costs will go up between 3-5 percent,  said Hani Berzi, Edita Food Industries chairman, one of the country's largest food producers.  I will have to absorb that, I have no intention of increasing prices... the market can't stand it.  Thursday's announcement came on the fourth anniversary of mass demonstrations against then-President Mohammed Mursi of the Muslim Brotherhood. Mursi, democratically elected after the 2011 revolution, was overthrown by Sisi, then the armed forces chief. Sisi on Saturday also ratified an agreement that cedes sovereignty over two uninhabited Red Sea islands to Saudi Arabia, which had long claimed them, brushing off widespread public criticism of the deal.

Several other airlines, domestic and international, have also expressed an interest in buying part of Air India, Jayant Sinha told reporters. He did not name any of the other airlines.  They (IndiGo) have expressed an interest in the strategic divestment process,  he said.  The process has just begun ... it's a very introductory interest.  IndiGo owner InterGlobe Aviation confirmed late on Thursday that it had sent a letter expressing an interest in buying the international operations of Air India and Air India Express to India's ministry of civil aviation earlier in the day.  Alternatively, we are equally interested in acquiring all of the airline operations of Air India and Air India Express,  InterGlobe President Aditya Ghosh said in the letter, a copy of which was sent to the stock exchange. The airline, which flies four of every 10 Indian domestic passengers and launched in 2006, has expanded rapidly in India's booming aviation market, with a focus on running a single fleet of aircraft and prioritising domestic routes - unlike Air India. Shares in InterGlobe closed down 2.2 percent in a firmer Mumbai market. The government's decision on Wednesday to give  in-principle  approval to sell Air India has kick-started a process that could see the government offload an airline struggling to turn a profit in the face of growing competition from low-cost rivals and its huge debts. Air India, once the country's biggest airline, has seen its domestic market share shrivel to 13 percent as private rivals such as IndiGo and SpiceJet have expanded. However, its sought-after landing slots on international routes, its domestic passenger base and the possibility of the government writing off part or all of the company's 520 billion rupees ($8 billion) in debt could make it an attractive proposition. Indian media have reported that the Tata conglomerate, which runs two airlines in partnership with Singapore Airlines and Malaysia's AirAsia, is also interested in acquiring part of Air India. Tata, which tried to buy the airline in a failed privatisation process a decade and half ago, has declined to comment. Any actual sale of Air India is some time away. India will now form a committee to decide on the details, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said on Wednesday, including the size of the stake to be sold.  We would greatly appreciate the opportunity to engage with the relevant ministries involved with Air India's privatisation process to discuss the matter in greater detail,  IndiGo's Ghosh said in the letter to the government. (bit.ly/2tomlxQ) Previous attempts to sell the state-owned airline have floundered, in part due to a lack of potential buyers and union opposition.

In the German state of Hesse, annual inflation rose to 1.9 percent in June from 1.7 percent in May, the data showed. It also edged up in Saxony, Brandenburg and Baden-Wuerttemberg while it remained stable in North Rhine-Westphalia and Bavaria. The state readings, which are not harmonized to compare with other euro zone countries, will feed into nationwide inflation data due at 1200 GMT. A Reuters poll conducted before the release of the regional data suggested EU-harmonized consumer price inflation fell to 1.3 percent in June from 1.4 percent in May. Capital Economics analyst Jennifer McKeown said the state readings now suggested that German inflation edged up in June to 1.5 percent, adding that price pressure would rise further in the coming months due to the robust German labor market.

Pediatricians recommend that mothers exclusively breastfeed infants until they’re at least 6 months of age because it can reduce babies’ risk of ear and respiratory infections, sudden infant death syndrome, allergies, childhood obesity and diabetes.  Mothers can benefit too, with longer periods of breastfeeding linked to lower risks of depression, bone deterioration and certain cancers. For the new study, researchers examined birth certificate data on 160,911 infants born at 126 hospitals statewide in 2014. Overall, they found, 48.5 percent of infants who were fed breast milk were also given formula.  Just 18.2 percent of breastfed newborns received formula at community hospitals that treat low-risk patients, compared to 50.6 percent to 57 percent at hospitals that handle more complex cases. But certain groups, including black, Hispanic, Asian and less educated mothers, had higher odds of supplementation at community hospitals.   “Every mother should have an equal chance to be supported to exclusively breastfeed,” said Dr. Lori Feldman-Winter, a pediatrics researcher at Cooper Medical School of Rowan University in Camden, New Jersey, who wasn’t involved in the study. Compared to white babies at community hospitals, black and Hispanic infants were almost twice as likely to get formula supplements, and the odds were almost three times higher for Asian newborns, the study found.  Babies of color were also more likely to get formula at hospitals that treat more complex cases, but the differences relative to white infants were not as pronounced.  At community hospitals, mothers without a high school degree were almost three times more likely to get formula for their babies than women with at master’s degree; at regional perinatal centers that treat the most complex patients the odds were doubled.  Women insured by Medicaid, the government health program for the poor, were 60 percent more likely to get formula for their babies as women with other insurance at regional perinatal centers; at community hospitals the odds increased by 27 percent.  Across all hospital levels, there were some places that met the HealthyPeople 2020 goal of reducing the proportion of newborns who receive supplemental formula to no more than 14 percent. This benchmark was set to encourage exclusive breastfeeding as often as possible while allowing for cases when women may be unable to do this.  One limitation of the study is that researchers lacked data on mothers’ planned feeding intentions or the reasons why the infant was supplemented with formula, the study authors, led by Dr. Trang Nguyen of the New York State Department of Health, write in the journal Pediatrics.  Medical evidence clearly shows that breastfeeding is crucial to the healthy growth and development of infants, and also provides important health benefits to mothers, the health department said in an emailed statement. Breastfeeding data for each hospital in the state is available on the health department’s website (here: on.ny.gov/2tZwrmA). Formula supplements may be needed in some circumstances, such as when the mother and infant are separated due to serious medical issues, when a baby has jaundice or when a newborn has very low birth weight or loses more weight than expected after birth, said Jennifer Yourkavitch, a certified lactation counselor at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, who wasn’t involved in the study. But it still is done too often, Feldman-Winter said.  “It is normal for mothers to produce very little milk volume during the first days of breastfeeding, and this is accompanied by normal weight loss in their babies,” Feldman-Winter said by email. “Over-supplementing with infant formula can lead to excess weight gain during the first years of life, and that is associated with being overweight at two years of age.” SOURCE: bit.ly/2siSDL9 Pediatrics, online June 26, 2017.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-breastfeeding-formula-idUSKBN19K265"},

About 10,000 people have been rescued over the last three days, mainly from unsafe smugglers' dinghies that had set out from Libya. Italy has taken in 82,000 refugees and migrants so far this year, a third more than a year ago. That makes Italy the main point of entry to Europe, a fact that is increasingly influencing domestic politics. Voters dealt a blow to the ruling party in local elections last week, opting for right-wing groups promising a tougher line on immigration.  We will support Italy in discussions on regional cooperation on disembarkation,  a migration spokeswoman for the European Commission told a briefing, adding the bloc's migration ministers would tackle the matter next week in Tallinn.  We understand Italy's concerns and we support their call for a change in the situation,  she said, and the charities running search-and-rescue operations in the Mediterranean would also be informed. The Commission has signalled readiness to give Italy more cash to help with increased arrivals, though officials and diplomats in Brussels were sceptical there would be any swift agreement for other EU states to take in the NGO boats. They said the ports of Barcelona and Marseille were possible options. Spain's EU mission declined immediate comment. A French diplomatic source said no such specific proposal was on the table at this stage and that this would be addressed at the migration ministers' meeting in the Estonian capital. Some 1.7 million refugees and migrants have attained EU shores after perilous Mediterranean voyages since 2014. The influx prompted a public backlash that bolstered euro-sceptic, anti-immigrant parties, prodding EU leaders into steps  to curb arrivals of people fleeing wars and poverty in the Middle East and Africa. The EU's 28 member states have long been at loggerheads over sharing out those asylum-seekers who make it to Europe, with formerly communist eastern capitals refusing to host any to help frontline states Italy and Greece. To discourage arrivals, the EU has turned increasingly restrictive in granting asylum and is trying to step up deportations of those judged to have arrived only to improve their standard of living, not to escape persecution or war. It has also increased assistance to Libya and other African states in hopes of improving stability and generating enough sustainable economic opportunity there to diminish the attractiveness of a hazardous odyssey to Europe. In addition, the EU runs a naval operation in the southern Mediterranean to rein in people smugglers. But all these measures have not reduced the number of crossings so far.  Politically, the situation is not good for Italy. If the arrival figures keep on rising, Rome will be in trouble,  an EU diplomat said.  But there are no easy solutions. I don't think others would be happy to accept these vessels in their ports.  (Editing by Mark Heinrich)","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/europe-migrants-italy-idUSL8N1JQ2X5"},

The feud between Arab powers threatens to undermine the region's progress in positioning itself as business friendly and raises concerns that some firms may be forced to pick sides.     Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut diplomatic ties with Qatar on June 5 and imposed economic sanctions, accusing it of funding terrorism, a claim Qatar rejects.     Many multinational businesses, from builders to law firms and banks, have a base in Dubai from where they serve the region, including Qatar.  Qatar is a valuable market for us and we want to continue here but it has become difficult and if there's no improvement we will have to review our strategy [in Qatar],  said a commercial manager at a European construction services company with a regional head office in UAE.  The company may be forced to stop bidding for new contracts in Qatar or wind down its operations altogether if sanctions intensify, the manager, who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter, said. Global banks are also in a bind. Some have joined lenders from the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Bahrain in curtailing new business in Qatar, while others including a few large Asian, European and U.S. banks are still providing financing. Many of the big international banks have strong relations with both Qatar and Saudi Arabia. HSBC, JPMorgan and Deutsche Bank were involved in sovereign bond issues by both Qatar and Saudi Arabia last year. The three banks declined to comment on how they are responding to the crisis.     Suspended land, sea and air links with Qatar have had the most immediate impact on businesses. For William Grieve, a Bahrain-based businessman with consulting work in Manama and Doha, his weekly 40-minute flight to Qatar is now a 10-hour journey via Kuwait.  When two elephants fight, it is the grass that suffers and that's what's happening now,  said Grieve. A Doha-based executive at an international engineering firm said the situation had already forced his company to delay some projects.      As a satellite office in Qatar we rely on being able to bring staff across from UAE regularly. Several jobs have had to be postponed due to building materials being held up in Jebel Ali port (in UAE),  he said.  Where necessary, employees have had to travel for seven hours via Oman to get to Qatar.  One construction firm in Doha has been forced to bypass the port of Jebel Ali and import raw materials either directly or via Oman - and discovered that it has actually lowered costs in doing so, a sales manager at the firm said. Risks to businesses, however, could increase as the four countries that cut ties with Qatar are now stepping up pressure. Last week they issued 13 demands to Doha, including closing Al Jazeera television, curbing relations with Iran and shutting a Turkish military base. Qatar is reviewing the list but has said the demands are not reasonable or actionable. Opportunities and Risks Governments dominate the commercial landscape of the region but they have worked hard to cultivate a business friendly image and are keen to attract foreign capital.     Qatar attracted 133 billion riyals ($36 billion) in foreign investment in 2015, the latest available figure. Opportunities in the region include oil giant Saudi Aramco's planned initial public offering in 2018, potentially the world's biggest IPO ever; the 2022 World Cup in Qatar; and the Dubai World Expo 2020. A Qatari official downplayed concerns about the rift making life harder for businesses and said it was an opportunity for new firms to enter a lucrative market.    Don't believe all the hype about business being affected. Qatar can weather the storm. It is business as usual for us here,  said the official who declined to be named under government briefing rules. Still, the CEO of the Qatar Stock Exchange, Rashid al-Mansoori, said the bourse may look to Asia or Europe for new consultants as transport costs for its current Dubai-based advisers have soared.    And the dispute has left some companies worried about the political risks attached to commercial deals. On June 20, Attorney General Ali al-Marri said Qatar would pursue legal action against firms and individuals that caused harm to Qatar.  Nobody is being asked to pick sides and I don't know if it will come to that, but if it did there would be some uncomfortable and potentially costly decisions to be made,  said an Australian businessman working for a multinational with interests in Doha, Dubai and Riyadh. Some companies are already turning down business for fear of being accused of a conflict of interest.    Law firms, for example, are being approached by Qatari individuals and businesses about potential class action law suits in the United States relating to the embargo.     We have been approached to represent those who have been damaged by the crisis but we are not in a position to accept as we are conflicted,  one lawyer said.   Although we have business in Qatar, we also have clients in UAE and Saudi Arabia. All the law firms do.      For businesses the drying up of financial flows between Qatar and its neighbors has made it trickier to make payments. One executive at a global engineering company, with a regional headquarters in Dubai, said his firm was making contingency plans to pay Qatar-based staff salaries through its European office if the dispute stops payments being made between Doha and Dubai.

After decades of strong growth, H&M; has repeatedly missed sales forecasts over the past year, with earnings squeezed by heavy investment and stiff competition from budget rivals such as Primark and online firms Zalando (ZALG.DE) and Asos (ASOS.L). The world's second-biggest fashion group reported a better than forecast 10 percent rise in pretax profit for March-May but said unexpectedly low sales and higher inventories meant it had to mark down the prices of its clothes more to get them sold.  CEO Karl-Johan Persson told Reuters it was looking  tough  to reach a target given in January for 10 percent to 15 percent sales growth this year after first-half sales came in lower than H&M; had expected. H&M;'s shares have been on a downward slope since 2015 and have fallen 18 percent in 2017 alone, whereas market leader Inditex (ITX.MC), the owner of Zara, has weathered sluggish markets better and seen its shares rise.  H&M;'s shares were up 2 percent by 1220 GMT as investors weighed the upbeat quarterly profit of 7.71 billion crowns ($904 million) against an uncertain outlook. Analysts had on average forecast profit of 7.1 billion crowns.   Whilst the outcome for the quarter is better than expected, there is plenty here for the bears too,  said Morgan Stanley analysts, who have an  underweight  rating on H&M; stock. The company put the profit increase down to better cost control and the opening of more stores. Investment Payoff? H&M; has made large investments to integrate its brick-and-mortar stores better with online shopping and speed up its supply chain. Analysts complain, however, that they are still seeing little sign of the investment paying off.  Swedish clothing retail company H&M CEO Karl-Johan Persson presents the company's second quarter report during a press conference in Stockholm, Sweden June 29, 2017. Henrik Montgomery/TT News Agency/via REUTERS H&M; has been investing heavily in online capability (IT, logistics and integration) for some time now, but sales growth has yet to respond to this,  said Societe Generale analyst Anne Critchlow, who rates H&M; stock as  sell .  For the H&M; concept's young value fashion target audience, stronger investment may be required, for example through a free delivery and returns offer, in line with some of the pure online competitors,  she said. Persson told a news conference investment would remain high. The company, which does not report online sales separately, predicted annual online sales growth of least 25 percent going forward.  H&M; is showing good confidence in the outlook for online sales and profitability. It still remains to be seen though whether its investments will have a net incremental benefit or if H&M; is merely playing catch up,  said RBC analyst Richard Chamberlain who has an  outperform  rating on the stock. FILE PHOTO: The logo of Swedish fashion label H&M is seen outside a store in Vienna, Austria, October 1, 2016,Leonhard Foeger /File PhotoH&M; warned of more price markdowns in its third quarter, after inventories also rose in the second quarter. It expected sales growth measured in local currencies in June, the first month of its third quarter, of 7 percent from a year earlier. Critchlow said that implied unchanged like-for-like sales and no improvement on the rest of the year so far. To reach more shoppers and reduce its exposure to the increasingly crowded budget clothes market, H&M; is branching out into new separate brands with higher prices than its core brand. H&M; reiterated on Thursday that its biggest separate chain, COS, would have sales of 10 billion crowns this year.  Inditex this month reported an 18 percent rise in quarterly profit.  H&M; also announced plans to open stores in new markets Uruguay and Ukraine next year.

Kenya relies heavily on geothermal and hydro power for its electricity, providing the bulk of the country's total 2,341 MW output. Wind power provides about 25 MW. The construction of the 266-mile (428-km), 400-kilovolt power line from the Lake Turkana Wind Power project, running from Loiyangalani in the north to Suswa in the center, started in November 2015 and had been due to be completed by December.        Danish wind turbine maker Vestas Wind Systems, supplier of the wind farm's 365 turbines, said this month the wind farm was ready for launch but would be idle until next year as the government had not yet installed the transmission line. Energy and Petroleum Cabinet Secretary Charles Keter said on Thursday work was under way to get all required material for local subcontractors as Spain's Grupo Isolux Corsan [GCFB.UL], the main contractor, was having financial difficulties.  We saw the need that instead of us terminating the contract, we'd rather manage by getting the materials because the subcontractors who are working on the line are Kenyans,  Keter told a news conference.  If we get the materials within the next three months, we should complete the line from Lake Turkana all the way to Suswa,  he said. The Lake Turkana consortium consists of KP&P; Africa, Aldwych International, Investment Fund for Developing Countries, Finnish Fund for Industrial Cooperation, Norwegian Investment Fund for Developing Countries, Sandpiper and Vestas.  Once completed, Google will acquire Vestas' 12.5 percent-stake in the project.

The study would apply lessons from the 2007-2009 financial crisis when Northern Rock collapsed because of an unsustainable business model, Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), told a conference on Thursday. It coincides with government efforts to increase competition in a sector dominated by HSBC, Lloyds, Royal Bank of Scotland and Barclays. Bailey said 16 new banks had been approved over the last five years and 38 were considering seeking authorisation.  My hope is that we can lay out a body of evidence from which conclusions can start to be drawn,  Bailey told the British Bankers' Association (BBA) conference, adding that evidence would be gathered into the first half of next year. The study will initially focus on different products and services and their profitability as fewer customers visit bank branches, preferring to use the phone or Internet instead. BBA Chief Executive Anthony Browne told the conference that apps were now the most popular way to access accounts. But he said there was a  public interest  in access to bank branches, after many have been closed as more customers bank online. Bailey said the study  should enable us to assess better the impact of changes – for instance in technology – on retail banking business models.  In a separate review to be published in coming months, the FCA has been examining so-called high-cost credit including overdrafts, after lawmakers criticised banks for charging hefty fees for people who overdraw on their accounts.  We will then be able to decide if we need to intervene further,  Bailey said. Britain has capped high interest rates on  payday  loans, where customers borrow money against their next monthly wage and usually face steep rates. Critics say the cap risks making it tougher for the most vulnerable to access credit and could drive them into the arms of unregulated  loan sharks . Bailey said this had not been the outcome so far. Some lawmakers have called for a wider use of caps, but Bailey said  capping everything  was not the right approach. Findings from a third review by the regulator, examining how banks assess customers' understanding of their products and services, are also due to be published soon. Some lawmakers have called for the banks to end what they call  free banking  for those in credit because they say it simply means other services, such as overdrafts, are charged more heavily and that often hurts the less well off more.  I do not advocate ending free-if-in-credit banking. Why? Because there is no such thing to start with,  Bailey said, adding that it simply meant some customers paid more or less than others depending on what products they used.

The measure is part of policy efforts to defuse a demographic time bomb that could hit the ageing continent over the next 50 years when the ratio of retirees to working-age people is estimated to double. As EU states' stretched public finances are struggling to cover current levels of pensions, the European Commission is trying to encourage personal savings to make up for lower pensions. The proposed Pan-European Personal Pension Product (PEPP), if approved by EU states and the European Parliament, will give consumers a new savings option and is expected to increase the number of people subscribing to a personal pension, the Commission said. Only 27 percent of working-age EU citizens have bought personal pensions, which complement occupational and state-funded pensions, setting aside 700 billion euros managed by banks, pension funds or insurances. The industry is expected to double its size in the EU by 2030, but the Commission said that, with PEPP, assets under management could reach 2.1 trillion euros. This is expected to benefit countries where there is virtually no market for personal pension products, particularly in eastern Europe. The Commission said only in Germany, Austria, Slovenia, Spain and Sweden 15 percent or more of eligible consumers made such investments. Mobile workers, who build their pension in several EU states, could also show interest, although they may face costs for merging the capital accumulated in different countries. EU countries will remain free to set their tax treatment of PEPP, although the Commission urged them to grant PEPP the same tax relief applied to national products. PEPP providers will need authorisation from the EU pension regulator, the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA). Managers of PEPP assets will be free to invest in all assets, including derivatives, as long as they respect consumers' choices when they opt for prudent investment. InsuranceEurope, which represents the sector's national associations, welcomed  at first sight  some of PEPP's features but said more time was needed to assess the added value of the proposal. PensionsEurope, the body representing the pension funds industry, welcomed the proposal and urged EU states to introduce tax incentives for PEPP.

Jandaga floated 45 million shares, giving it a value of about 9.9 million pounds. The shares, placed at 5 pence, were trading at 5.34p by 1500 GMT. Executive chairman, Brian McMaster, said the company will spend the money developing its Pedra Branca mine. It also has exploration licences to find more platinum, nickel and copper. South African mining companies, which produce 70 percent of the world's platinum, are hamstrung by soaring costs and low precious metal prices as well as new rules requiring higher black ownership that they say discourage investment. South Africa's mainly underground mines can be as deep as nearly 2 km (1.2 miles), making them costly to mine. Jandaga Mines' shallow, open-pit Pedra Branca project in Brazil aims to produce 30,000 ounces of platinum group metals per annum within 12-18 months. McMaster said even with the pressures on South African miners, such as Lonmin  and Impala Platinum , Pedra Branca was an attractive investment because its costs were low and production was due to begin next year.  Regardless of what happens in South Africa our story still makes sense,  he said. Even at today's platinum prices the mine would be profitable. The price of platinum, used to reduce emissions in diesel cars, has lagged a general rebound among other commodities.

The three officials from Spain, Italy and Slovakia had faced charges stemming from the sale of state properties in 2015. The case had stalled in a system backlog, but it had been an obstacle to Greece's chances of getting fresh funds from the EU under a multi-billion euro bailout brokered in 2015. Payments for the next tranche are due to start in early July. Spain had said it would block disbursement of aid, amounting to 8.5 billion euros, unless Athens granted immunity to the three, who were consultants for the country's privatisation agency. The experts had been charged by a prosecutor with breach of duty in relation to a sale and lease-back deal involving 28 state-owned buildings. Thursday's decision, by the deputy prosecutor of the country's Supreme Court, also dropped charges against three board members of the privatisation agency and a further three consultants. The deputy prosecutor based his decision on the  lack of justification  for pursuing the case, and on flawed legal reasoning, the court officials said.

Please credit Stateline, an initiative of the Pew Charitable Trusts. For downloadable graphics, please visit www.pewtrusts.org/stateline) By Rebecca Beitsch June 29 (Stateline) - When Brad Hoylman and his husband wanted to start a family, they looked to a woman nearly 3,000 miles away to carry their child. The two Manhattanites turned to a surrogate in California, a state with a robust commercial surrogacy industry, because the practice is banned in New York. The advent of gay marriage, advances in reproductive technology, and the fact that more people are waiting longer to start families have fueled a surge in the surrogacy industry. In 2015, 2,807 babies were born through surrogacy in the U.S., up from 738 in 2004, according to the American Society for Reproductive Medicine. Women are often paid at least $30,000 to carry a baby created from the egg and sperm of others. But in many places, once the baby arrives, outdated state laws fail to answer an important question: Who are the parents? In many states the law is murky or even silent on surrogacy. The industry is free to operate but the contracts signed between surrogates and intended parents may not be legally binding. The baby may be born in a state that views the woman who gave birth as its mother, even if she has no genetic connection to the child. The legal uncertainty is particularly concerning to the intended parents, who usually spend about $100,000 (including payments to a surrogate and the company she works with as well as doctors and lawyers) and risk ending up without the child they counted on. Gay male couples have an additional fear: that they might be discriminated against if they are embroiled in a legal fight over custody. In states that ban commercial surrogacy and those with no laws at all, legislators are pushing bills that would legalize the practice, determine parentage before a child arrives, and ensure that contracts are enforceable and followed by all parties. In many cases, they would require surrogates to be at least 21, to have already given birth to their own children, and to undergo medical and psychiatric evaluations before signing a contract. Hoylman, a state senator from New York, introduced a bill this year that would legalize surrogacy in his state and establish the legal framework of intended parentage. Surrogacy became legal in Washington, D.C., in April, and lawmakers in Minnesota and Massachusetts debated bills this year but didn’t approve them. In New Jersey, state lawmakers passed similar bills in 2012 and in 2015, but Republican Gov. Chris Christie vetoed them. The Senate passed another bill this week. Women and Babies as Commodities? Critics of surrogacy, including both religious conservatives and some feminists, object to what they view as the commodification of both women and children. Opponents point to numerous European countries that have banned the practice and say states should be wary of letting American women be used by others, including foreigners searching for surrogates beyond their borders. For many, the financial aspect of surrogacy is most troubling. “Women will be exploited by wealthy people,” said Jason Adkins, executive director of Minnesota’s Catholic Conference. “We see all kinds of Hollywood stars contracting with surrogates, but we don’t see any Hollywood stars serving as surrogates for their nannies and maids.” Surrogacy companies prefer to work with women they consider financially stable in order to avoid women who may be acting out of financial desperation. Medicaid does not cover surrogacy costs, and women who are enrolled in the program would risk losing coverage for themselves and their families if they carry a surrogate baby. Hoylman, and even some surrogacy critics, say having no rules puts surrogates and intended parents at risk. Two married men in Virginia nearly lost their child who was born through a surrogate in Wisconsin after a judge there declared the baby an orphan rather than turn it over to either the parents or the surrogate. The couple later won custody, and the judge resigned. Hoylman and his husband turned to a surrogate in California six years ago to avoid such trouble. They plan to return to the state in August for the birth of their second child. In California, and in most of the other 11 states and Washington, D.C., that permit commercial surrogacy, the intended parents are able to get pre-birth orders that name them as parents before a child even arrives. Only Indiana, Nebraska, New Jersey, Michigan and Washington share New York’s ban on commercial surrogacy. By lifting the ban, Hoylman hopes New Yorkers would no longer be forced to go to nearby states, where their parental rights may not be recognized. “I don’t want to send New Yorkers to other states especially where laws aren’t even written. It’s dangerous. I can picture the image of a judge in some rural part of the country, on the bench, looking down his nose at a gay couple and their surrogate and trying to determine just who the parent of this child is,” he said. “That’s my worst-case scenario.” The Supreme Court’s 2015 decision to allow same-sex marriage in all 50 states has further opened the door to surrogacy for gay couples, as five states allow the process only for married couples. But not all have created a welcoming environment for gay couples: Louisiana limits surrogacy to heterosexual couples by requiring that the intended parents supply both the sperm and egg used in the process. Multiple Steps in Minnesota Minnesota has no laws on the books governing surrogacy, yet it has a robust industry. A number of surrogacy companies in the state match women with couples who are frequently gay and often come from countries where surrogacy is prohibited. Because the state has no laws on the books governing surrogacy, couples often go through a multistep process to obtain custody, said Steve Snyder, a lawyer who owns a surrogacy company and represents intended parents in court. The process is especially fraught for gay male couples who fear they may not get the necessary judicial approval. If a surrogate is married, Minnesota law presumes her husband to be the father of the child. In the case of two gay men, the genetic father must file a paternity suit to remove the surrogate’s husband from the child’s birth certificate. The surrogate and genetic father are then listed as the child’s parents. Once the surrogate waives her parental rights, the genetic father’s spouse is free to adopt the child. Surrogates who work with Snyder’s agency sign a contract saying they will not visit Michigan, New York, Nebraska, New Jersey or Washington during the pregnancy for fear that if they delivered there, it could be difficult to transfer custody to the intended parents. State Rep. John Lesch, a Democrat who sponsored legislation that would allow commercial surrogacy and establish the process to obtain a pre-birth order, said Minnesota’s current process leaves gay couples facing too much risk that they will be discriminated against during the legal process. He doesn’t want parents fighting judges for custody like the couple in Wisconsin. “Very few parents are going to want to enter into a legal minefield with knowing most judges are pretty good,” he said. “They’re going to want to know the law is on their side.” Famous cases like the 1988 “Baby M” case, in which a New Jersey surrogate attempted to keep the baby she delivered, helped spur bans on surrogacy in that state and others. But such instances are quite rare, Snyder said, and proponents of surrogacy laws seem to be more worried about what actions judges or intended parents might take. Pre-birth orders would solve the problem of disputed parentage. Because the contracts would be enforceable, surrogates would be required to give up the child and the new parents would be required to take it. Many surrogates say they want legal protection to ensure the intended parents take the baby, regardless of any birth defects or a change in their own life situations. “Both sides are taking an emotional risk. We’re taking on more of a physical risk; [intended parents] are taking on more of a financial and legal risk,” said Traci Woolard, 44, a Minnesota woman who has delivered five babies as a surrogate after having four children of her own. Woolard’s fear is that a judge could decide to leave her with a baby. “My family’s done. It’s complete, and I do not want to have any more children.” here","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/stateline-idUSL1N1JQ0YD"},

Apple has sold more than 1 billion iPhones since June 29, 2007, but the first iPhone, which launched without an App Store and was restricted to the AT&T; Inc network (T.N), was limited compared to today's version. After sluggish initial sales, Apple slashed the price to spur holiday sales that year.   The business model for year one of the iPhone was a disaster,  Tony Fadell, one of the Apple developers of the device, told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday.  We pivoted and figured it out in year two.   The very concept of the iPhone came as a surprise to some of Apple's suppliers a decade ago, even though Apple, led by CEO Steve Jobs, had already expanded beyond computers with the iPod.  We still have the voicemail from Steve Jobs when he called the CEO and founder here,  said David Bairstow at Skyhook, the company that supplied location technology to early iPhones.  He thought he was being pranked by someone in the office and it took him two days to call Steve Jobs back.  The iPhone hit its stride in 2008 when Apple introduced the App Store, which allowed developers to make and distribute their mobile applications with Apple taking a cut of any revenue.

New Model Fans and investors are now looking forward to the 10th anniversary iPhone 8, expected this fall, asking whether it will deliver enough new features to spark a new generation to turn to Apple. Slideshow (4 Images)That new phone may have 3-D mapping sensors, support for  augmented reality  apps that would merge virtual and real worlds, and a new display with organic LEDs, which are light and flexible, according to analysts at Bernstein Research. A decade after launching into a market largely occupied by BlackBerry and Microsoft devices, the iPhone now competes chiefly with phones running Google's Android software, which is distributed to Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) and other manufacturers around the world. Even though most of the world's smartphones now run on Android, Apple still garners most of the profit in the industry with its generally higher-priced devices.  More than 2 billion people now have smartphones, according to data from eMarketer, and Fadell, who has worked for both Apple and Alphabet, sees that as the hallmark of success.  Being able to democratize computing and communication across the entire world is absolutely astounding to me,  Fadell said.  It warms my heart because that's something Steve tried to do with the Apple II and the Mac, which was the computer for the rest of us. It's finally here, 30 years later.

Debt-ridden Mozambique released on Saturday a forensic audit report into $2 billion worth of loans made to tuna fishing company EMATUM, security firm Proindicus and Mozambique Asset Management(MAM). The report by risk management firm Kroll Inc found around a quarter of the money remained unaccounted for. It said no evidence was provided that any assessment took place before government guarantees worth $1 billion were signed. Potential conflict of interest issues were also identified, it added. Reacting to the report, the Global Group of Mozambique Bondholders (GGBM) said in an emailed statement it was  evident that there is no basis -- in either Mozambican or English law -- for the Mozambique government to honour the purported guarantees of the Proindicus and MAM loans.   Disavowal of those purported guarantees and the liquidation of Proindicus, MAM, and Ematum is the appropriate restructuring that needs to take place to clean up the system,  GGBM said. This would also help insulate the government balance sheet from further liabilities and help restore access to external financing for Mozambique, the group added. Discovery of the previously hidden credits led the International Monetary Fund and Western donors to halt support to Mozambique, triggering the collapse of its currency and leading to a default on debt. Mozambique told its creditors last autumn that its debt position was unsustainable and it had to renegotiate repayment terms. Bondholders dug in their heels, saying they had already accepted one debt swap in the spring of 2016, and other lenders should be first in line to take additional pain. In its latest statement, the group also said Mozambique's economy was improving thanks to a strengthening of the Metical currency, a recovery in exports and an increase in foreign exchange reserves. Government efforts to tackle expenditure such as fuel subsidies, increased tax receipts and a recovery in foreign direct investment had also helped, the group said. The GGMB estimated that the government's capacity to service its debt payments over the next five years had improved by about $850 million. The 2023 bond has some $727 million outstanding, according to Reuters data. Two-thirds of that issue is held by the steering committee of the group, or large bondholders supporting it, a lawyer for the GGBM said.

After losing more than 2 percent against the dollar when Prime Minister Theresa May lost her parliamentary majority in the June 8 election, the pound has recovered as BoE officials bent towards raising record low interest rates. The Bank's Governor Mark Carney said on Wednesday that a rise in rates was likely to be needed as the economy came closer to running at full capacity, and that the Bank would debate this in the coming months. For markets, that ran contrary to comments Carney made last week when he said now was not the time to raise interest rates, when his chief economist Andy Haldane flipped to support a hike later this year. Sterling strengthened to $1.2995 in early European trade, briefly rising as high as $1.3007 after Haldane told the BBC the bank needed to look seriously at raising rates. It was last up 0.4 percent on the day at $1.2984 and 0.1 percent higher at 87.90 pence per euro.   (Carney's comments) have been quite supportive for the pound, particularly against the dollar which is trading around pre-election levels,  said Alexandra Russell-Oliver, currency analyst with Caxton FX.  The market's getting ahead of itself and focusing on the hawkish aspects of his comments. I think (a rate hike) will ultimately depend on how the data unfolds and what developments we see in terms of Brexit negotiations.  Politics remained on investors' radars, ahead of a parliamentary vote on Prime Minister Theresa May's policy programme, watered down after her election setback and growing pressure over her Brexit and austerity plans. Britain called for a speedy agreement between pro-British unionists and Irish nationalists in Northern Ireland, but the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) said a breakthrough will not be possible before Thursday's deadline to restore the province's power-sharing government. The Irish and British governments - guarantors of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement which ended three decades of sectarian violence in Northern Ireland - have warned that a failure to reach an agreement would have  profound and serious  implications and limit the province's influence in Brexit talks. With a weakening dollar and a strengthening euro, strategists were suggesting investors might now use the single currency to express a bearish take on sterling as Britain enters a period of uncertainty negotiating its exit from the EU.

The rollout of the controversial measure follows a U.S. Supreme Court decision this week that allowed the executive order to take effect but significantly narrowed its scope, exempting travelers and refugees with a  bona fide relationship  with a person or entity in the United States. It is set to go into effect at 8 p.m. ET (0000 GMT Friday). Late Wednesday, the State Department said visa applicants from Iran, Libya, Syria, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen must have a close U.S. family relationship or formal ties to a U.S. entity to be admitted to the United States. Trump first announced a temporary travel ban in January, calling it a counterterrorism measure to allow time to develop better security vetting. The order caused chaos at airports as officials scrambled to enforce it and was blocked by federal courts, with opponents arguing the measure discriminated against Muslims and there was no security rationale for it. A revised version of the ban, issued in March, was also halted by courts. In its decision on Monday, the Supreme Court allowed the ban, which bars people from the designated six countries for 90 days and refugees for 120 days, to go partially into effect until the top court can take up the case later this year. The State Department guidance on the ban, distributed to all U.S. diplomatic posts and seen by Reuters, defined a close familial relationship as being a parent, spouse, child, adult son or daughter, son-in-law, daughter-in-law or sibling, including step siblings and other step family relations.  Grandparents, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, cousins, brothers-laws and sisters-in-law, fiancés, and any other 'extended' family members,  are not considered close family, according to the cable, first reported by the Associated Press. Asked about the guidance, the State Department declined to comment on internal communications. The Department of Homeland Security is expected to release additional information on Thursday. A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment. Several immigration lawyers expressed surprise late on Wednesday that fiancés, grandparents and grandchildren would not qualify as close family.  This language is extremely disappointing,  said Johnathan Smith, legal director at Muslim Advocates, a civil rights group.  Defining close family to exclude grandparents, cousins, and other relatives defies common sense and directly goes against the intent of the Supreme Court's order.  The ban's looming enforcement stirred anger and confusion in parts of the Middle East on Wednesday, with would-be visitors worried about their travel plans and their futures. Airlines in the region said they had not received a directive from the United States, and there were few people at the U.S. Consulate in Dubai, where there is normally a line out the door of people waiting to process visa applications. On Thursday, Emirates Airline, the Middle East's largest airline, said its flights to the United States were operating normally. Abu Dhabi-based Etihad Airways said it is allowing nationals from the six countries to board U.S.-bound flights if they have valid travel documents.

While the National Health Service provides free abortions to women in most of the United Kingdom, abortion is only permitted in Northern Ireland if a woman's life is at risk or if there is a serious risk to her health. Finance minister Philip Hammond told parliament the government would  fund abortions in England for women arriving here from Northern Ireland . Women's rights groups estimate around 1,000 women travel to Britain each year for terminations, which they must finance themselves along with travel and other costs. Justine Greening, Britain's minister for women and equalities, said the government was committed to providing safe abortions.  This is clearly a sensitive issue and one which has direct implications for equality in treatment of women from Northern Ireland,  Greening wrote in a letter to parliamentarians. Clinics in England charge around 600 pounds ($779) to terminate pregnancies of less than 14 weeks and up to 2,000 pounds for more advanced pregnancies. Earlier this month, Britain's highest court rejected an appeal by a mother and daughter in their legal battle for women from Northern Ireland to receive free abortions in England.  Political parties in Northern Ireland are divided on abortion. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), which struck a billion-pound deal in return for its support for British Prime Minister May's minority government, is among the most socially conservative in Europe and opposes widespread access to abortion.

After losing more than 2 percent against the dollar when Prime Minister Theresa May lost her parliamentary majority in the June 8 election, the pound has recovered as BoE officials bent towards raising record low interest rates. The Bank's Governor Mark Carney said on Wednesday that a rise in rates was likely to be needed as the economy came closer to running at full capacity, and that the Bank would debate this in the coming months. For markets, that ran contrary to comments Carney made last week when he said now was not the time to raise interest rates, when his chief economist Andy Haldane flipped to support a hike later this year. Sterling strengthened to $1.2995 in early European trade, briefly rising as high as $1.3007 after Haldane told the BBC the bank needed to look seriously at raising rates. It was last up 0.4 percent on the day at $1.2984 and 0.1 percent higher at 87.90 pence per euro.   (Carney's comments) have been quite supportive for the pound, particularly against the dollar which is trading around pre-election levels,  said Alexandra Russell-Oliver, currency analyst with Caxton FX.  The market's getting ahead of itself and focusing on the hawkish aspects of his comments. I think (a rate hike) will ultimately depend on how the data unfolds and what developments we see in terms of Brexit negotiations.  Politics remained on investors' radars, ahead of a parliamentary vote on Prime Minister Theresa May's policy programme, watered down after her election setback and growing pressure over her Brexit and austerity plans. Britain called for a speedy agreement between pro-British unionists and Irish nationalists in Northern Ireland, but the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) said a breakthrough will not be possible before Thursday's deadline to restore the province's power-sharing government. The Irish and British governments - guarantors of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement which ended three decades of sectarian violence in Northern Ireland - have warned that a failure to reach an agreement would have  profound and serious  implications and limit the province's influence in Brexit talks. With a weakening dollar and a strengthening euro, strategists were suggesting investors might now use the single currency to express a bearish take on sterling as Britain enters a period of uncertainty negotiating its exit from the EU.  With the euro in play, many may feel that the euro also now provides a more suitable vehicle with which to express their politically orientated doubts about sterling: of course, there is just the question of whether the market has placed the appropriate spin on Mr Carney's 'hawkish' comments yesterday,  Neil Mellor, currency strategist at Bank of New York Mellon, wrote in a note.

The feud between Arab powers threatens to undermine the region's progress in positioning itself as business friendly and raises concerns that some firms may be forced to pick sides. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut diplomatic ties with Qatar on June 5 and imposed economic sanctions, accusing it of funding terrorism, a claim Qatar rejects. Many multinational businesses, from builders to law firms and banks, have a base in Dubai from where they serve the region, including Qatar.  Qatar is a valuable market for us and we want to continue here but it has become difficult and if there's no improvement we will have to review our strategy [in Qatar],  said a commercial manager at a European construction services company with a regional head office in UAE. The company may be forced to stop bidding for new contracts in Qatar or wind down its operations altogether if sanctions intensify, the manager, who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter, said. Global banks are also in a bind. Some have joined lenders from the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Bahrain in curtailing new business in Qatar, while others including a few large Asian, European and U.S. banks are still providing financing. Many of the big international banks have strong relations with both Qatar and Saudi Arabia. HSBC, JPMorgan and Deutsche Bank were involved in sovereign bond issues by both Qatar and Saudi Arabia last year. The three banks declined to comment on how they are responding to the crisis. Suspended land, sea and air links with Qatar have had the most immediate impact on businesses. For William Grieve, a Bahrain-based businessman with consulting work in Manama and Doha, his weekly 40-minute flight to Qatar is now a 10-hour journey via Kuwait.  When two elephants fight, it is the grass that suffers and that's what's happening now,  said Grieve. A Doha-based executive at an international engineering firm said the situation had already forced his company to delay some projects.  As a satellite office in Qatar we rely on being able to bring staff across from UAE regularly. Several jobs have had to be postponed due to building materials being held up in Jebel Ali port (in UAE),  he said.  Where necessary, employees have had to travel for seven hours via Oman to get to Qatar.  One construction firm in Doha has been forced to bypass the port of Jebel Ali and import raw materials either directly or via Oman - and discovered that it has actually lowered costs in doing so, a sales manager at the firm said. Risks to businesses, however, could increase as the four countries that cut ties with Qatar are now stepping up pressure. Last week they issued 13 demands to Doha, including closing Al Jazeera television, curbing relations with Iran and shutting a Turkish military base. Qatar is reviewing the list but has said the demands are not reasonable or actionable. Opportunities and Risks Governments dominate the commercial landscape of the region but they have worked hard to cultivate a business friendly image and are keen to attract foreign capital. Qatar attracted 133 billion riyals ($36 billion) in foreign investment in 2015, the latest available figure. Opportunities in the region include oil giant Saudi Aramco's planned initial public offering in 2018, potentially the world's biggest IPO ever; the 2022 World Cup in Qatar; and the Dubai World Expo 2020. A Qatari official downplayed concerns about the rift making life harder for businesses and said it was an opportunity for new firms to enter a lucrative market.  Don't believe all the hype about business being affected. Qatar can weather the storm. It is business as usual for us here,  said the official who declined to be named under government briefing rules. Still, the CEO of the Qatar Stock Exchange, Rashid al-Mansoori, said the bourse may look to Asia or Europe for new consultants as transport costs for its current Dubai-based advisers have soared. And the dispute has left some companies worried about the political risks attached to commercial deals. On June 20, Attorney General Ali al-Marri said Qatar would pursue legal action against firms and individuals that caused harm to Qatar.  Nobody is being asked to pick sides and I don't know if it will come to that, but if it did there would be some uncomfortable and potentially costly decisions to be made,  said an Australian businessman working for a multinational with interests in Doha, Dubai and Riyadh. Some companies are already turning down business for fear of being accused of a conflict of interest. Law firms, for example, are being approached by Qatari individuals and businesses about potential class action law suits in the United States relating to the embargo.  We have been approached to represent those who have been damaged by the crisis but we are not in a position to accept as we are conflicted,  one lawyer said.  Although we have business in Qatar, we also have clients in UAE and Saudi Arabia. All the law firms do.  For businesses the drying up of financial flows between Qatar and its neighbours has made it trickier to make payments. One executive at a global engineering company, with a regional headquarters in Dubai, said his firm was making contingency plans to pay Qatar-based staff salaries through its European office if the dispute stops payments being made between Doha and Dubai.

In an interview with the Wirtschaftswoche magazine published on Thursday, Merkel did not give a clear commitment to the diesel technology that her government has promoted to help cut carbon dioxide emissions and fight climate change.  What is important is that the newest and best technology is used,  she was quoted as saying.  We are in a transformation phase away from the combustion engine.  Merkel's comments - almost two years after the Volkswagen emissions scandal broke - come as her government faces growing pressure ahead of national elections on Sept. 24 to reduce diesel pollution or see cities impose driving bans. Sales of diesel cars have been falling since the VW scandal, but have dropped faster since cities, including Stuttgart and Munich, have considered banning some diesel vehicles, blaming emissions for a rise in respiratory disease. On Tuesday, German ministers announced they would establish a national  diesel forum  to find ways to cut pollution and set up a new organisation to test vehicles. On Wednesday, German carmakers BMW, Audi and truck manufacturer MAN agreed with the regional government in Bavaria to cut nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions from diesel engines, a likely precursor to the national plan. Foreign carmakers have not yet committed to cutting emissions but will likely do so by the Aug. 2 meeting of the government's  diesel forum  on Aug. 2, the German auto importers' association VDIK said on Thursday. Germany's ADAC car club, Europe's largest and most influential, has warned consumers to push back planned purchases of diesel cars until cleaner Euro-6D technology becomes available in new models this autumn. Merkel said how fast the shift away from combustion engines took place had to be negotiated, with efficient combustion engines likely to still have a long future, perhaps combined with electric motors in hybrid cars. Last month, she admitted Germany was likely to miss the government's target of bringing 1 million electric cars onto the roads by the end of the decade, but added the breakthrough could come very abruptly, as with the smartphone. Merkel, who has been criticised by environmental and consumer groups for defending the diesel industry since the VW scandal, hit out at manufacturers that cheat emissions tests.  There is nothing that can justify the fraudulent methods used to limit test values in the diesel area of some manufacturers that has damaged the whole diesel business,  she said.  For many years we have appreciated diesel because it helped save fuel and CO2,  she said, adding some things had to be re-evaluated.

The treatment is almost impossible for Libyan families to obtain due to the collapse of the health system and an economic crisis that makes sending patients abroad unaffordable.  The doctors have been visiting eastern Libya since 2012, but did not go to Benghazi for two years because of fighting that has destroyed parts of the city and is still raging in one downtown neighborhood.  This time they hope to operate on 30 to 40 children, though the final number will depend on the complexity of children's' defects. Most are under three years old. Some could die within weeks without the treatment.   Khaled al-Fellah's 19-month old daughter Zahra was among the first to receive the surgery.    Her heart problem was discovered the day of her birth . . . We received basic treatment to maintain the condition as there were no possibilities (for medical care),  he said.   The diagnosis was wrong many times. When the diagnosis was correct a surgery had to be performed. We should have had this surgery 10 months ago.   The team is led by William Novick, an American doctor who set up a foundation that has treated children with heart disease in more than 30 developing countries. They train local staff as they work.

For the past three years rival alliances have been battling for power in Libya, setting up competing governments in Tripoli and the east. Benghazi, where forces loyal to Khalifa Haftar have been fighting Islamists and other opponents, has seen some of the heaviest violence. A U.N.-backed government has been trying to establish itself in Tripoli since last March, but Haftar and the eastern government have rejected it. Across the country, public services have continued a slow decline.

Medical supplies and equipment are in short supply, and many hospitals are shut or barely functional.  Conditions at the Benghazi Medical Center have got worse, Novick said.  The staff is gone. The maintenance of the hospital is low,  he said.  I've found that the situation has very much deteriorated since 2012.   Reida El Oakley, the health minister for the eastern government, said a private clinic in Tripoli is the only medical facility in the country that offers heart operations.  The 28,000 Libyan dinar ($20,000) cost is prohibitive for Libyans who  go bankrupt to treat their children  but struggle to withdraw even a few hundred dinars from the bank because of a liquidity crisis. Trips by Novick's teams have been delayed because of funding shortages. Lives have been lost because of a lack of treatment, said Oakley.   We have more than 300 kids waiting for open heart surgery, maybe 400,  he said.  (The doctors) need to be here full time.

The National Monetary Council, Brazil's highest body of economic policy, set inflation targets of 4.25 percent for 2019 and 4.00 percent for 2020, compared with the goal of 4.50 percent for previous years.     Economists expected a reduction, but the lower 2020 goal came as a surprise. Before the decision was announced, they had been forecasting an annual inflation rate of 4.25 percent for the years of 2019, 2020 and 2021, according to a weekly central bank poll released on Monday.     The lower target fostered bets that the central bank could cut rates by more than expected next year, traders said. Still, short-term rate futures were flat as the outlook for the near term remained intact, with yields suggesting a 75 basis-point cut in the Selic rate next month to 9.5 percent.     Hopes that President Michel Temer's plan to revamp labor regulations could pass a Senate vote next week also helped drive long-term yields lower after a congressional committee approved the proposal early on Thursday.     Demand for Brazilian assets has increased on hopes that Temer's plan could curb public debt and boost long-term economic growth, but mounting corruption scandals have left some traders cautious.     The Brazilian real, however, weakened 0.3 percent, tracking other Latin American currencies lower.     The Mexican peso was down 0.8 percent as traders booked profits from a recent rally following stronger-than-expected U.S. economic growth data.      The U.S. report allayed some concerns over the pace of economic growth in the world's No. 1 economy, which had triggered bets on a slow pace of interest rate hikes in coming months.

Most of the cuts will be at the loss-making train-making division's plants in Hennigsdorf near Berlin and Goerlitz on the German border with Poland, he told a news conference on Thursday, confirming a Reuters report published last week. He said Bombardier's factory in the eastern German town of Bautzen could even see its headcount rise if orders were strong, and added that there was an agreement to have no compulsory redundancies until the end of 2019. Bombardier said last October it would slash 7,500 jobs worldwide, mostly in its Germany-based train-making division, following extended delays and budget overruns in its aerospace business. The group declined to say on Thursday what impact a possible tie-up with the rail business of German engineering group Siemens would have on the restructuring. Siemens and Bombardier have held talks to combine their rail operations, two people close to the matter told Reuters in April, although such a tie-up would be difficult because of antitrust concerns and questions over which company would retain control of a combined venture.

Joint sessions of parliament, known as a Congress, are rare and take place in the sumptuous palace of France's former kings built at Versailles outside Paris by Louis XIV to symbolize absolute power. Macron's aides say he intends to use the occasion to set the tone of his presidency just over a month after his election. But leftwing firebrand Jean-Luc Melenchon, who leads the 17-strong 'France Unbowed' group in parliament, said the Congress showed Macron's intent to concentrate power in his own hands.  It is the sign of the pharaonic drift of this monarchical presidency,  Melenchon, a fierce orator known for his colorful rhetoric, told reporters.  This meeting has no real objective other than have us listen to the president.  Melenchon, who came fourth in the first round of the presidential election in April with 19.5 percent of the votes, also complained about his lawmakers getting no top jobs in parliamentary committees and what he said was too little time to prepare amendments on labor law decrees.  We are rebelling and we won't be subdued,  he said, adding:  Our only way to show our anger is ... not to go to Versailles.

Under its current capital program, the MTA is spending $32.5 billion between 2015 and 2019 to upgrade aging transit infrastructure, improve its communications with commuters and replace some of its subway cars. Nearly half of that spending is going towards improvements in the New York City subway system, with the remainder split between various commuter railroads, bus networks, bridges and tunnels that the MTA operates.  We're seeing what happens when a transit system breaks down,  Cuomo said in a speech, referring to increasingly common delays he said were infuriating New Yorkers, as well as the subway train derailment this week that injured 34 people.  The current state of decline is wholly unacceptable and we're gonna do something about it now.  Only 63 percent of subway trains are arriving on time so far in 2017, compared to 85 percent just six years ago, according to MTA data. The $1 billion comes in addition to $8.3 billion in state funding to the MTA's 2015-2019 capital program he announced last year. Other funding comes from New York City, the federal government and through the sale of bonds. Cuomo, speaking at an MTA event bringing transit experts together to discuss new ideas for improving the system, also said he would sign an executive order declaring  a state of emergency when it comes to the MTA,  but details of what that order might achieve were not immediately available.

The stock touched a high of $10.46 in early trading, giving the company a market capitalization of about $2 billion. The 30-million share offering was priced at $10 per share late on Wednesday, after the company slashed its valuation expectations by a third. Blue Apron's IPO, the first for a U.S. meal-kit company, was expected to create a buzz around smaller peers, which are either looking to go public or be acquired at rich valuations. However, Amazon.com's $13.7 billion deal to buy Whole Foods Market Inc has left potential investors worried about the prospects of the meal-kit industry. There are also concerns about the company's lack of profitability and marketing costs. Like other meal-kit companies, Blue Apron has spent heavily on marketing to compete for customers who often switch from one service to another, or cancel their subscriptions altogether. The company spent roughly 18 percent of its $795.4 million revenue in 2016 on marketing, posting a net loss of $54.9 million. It has also faced steep costs of building out delivery infrastructure for fresh food. Blue Apron was founded in 2012 by Matthew Salzberg, Matt Wadiak and Ilia Papas to deliver ingredients and recipes that would allow customers prepare meals at home. In 2014, the company started selling curated selections of cooking utensils and pantry items via its online marketplace, Blue Apron Market, and in September 2015, it expanded its culinary gamut to include wine. The company bought BN Ranch, a supplier of beef, poultry and lamb, in February.

Bain and Cinven’s initial €5.3bn takeover bid fell through after 65.52% of Stada’s equity signed up for the deal, below the 67.5% threshold required. The financing was conditional on the buyout going ahead and should in theory have fallen away once the bid failed. However, the financing remains in place for now and is expected to back any new bid Bain and Cinven are likely to make, the sources said. A new bid could launch as early as next week and is likely to come before the summer if one is made, the sources said. The private equity firms are expected to bid at the same price but lower the acceptance threshold to 65%, the sources said. They will need the underwriting banks to approve the lower acceptance level in order to keep the same financing in place, the sources said. The banks -- Barclays, Citigroup, Commerzbank, Jefferies, JP Morgan, Nomura, Societe Generale and UBS -- are expected to approve the lower limit, as they are keen to keep the profitable financing in play, the sources said.  The banks will be more than eager to finance this deal -- the whole of the market wants to buy it,  one of the sources said. Any new bid launched within a year needs recommendation from Stada's executive and supervisory boards. The 65% threshold is likely to be an attractive proposition, as it gives a high level of certainty a second offer will be successful, enabling Stada to avoid the embarrassment and repercussions of another failed bid. Bain and Cinven declined to comment. Stada was not immediately available to comment. Highly Anticipated As potentially Europe’s largest leveraged financing so far this year, it has been highly anticipated by both loan and high- yield bond investors. They have been starved of new money opportunities and are eager for the chance to soak up excess liquidity and reverse the supply/demand imbalance that has plagued the market. The underwritten financing comprises a €1.95bn seven-year senior secure term loan B; €485m of seven-year senior secured fixed rate bonds; €340m of eight-year senior unsecured fixed rate notes; and a €400m seven-year revolving credit facility. The underwriting banks are set to recieve €60m of fees altogether -- around €7.5m each -- based on a 2% underwriting fee. A fee of this size is unprecedented so far this year after a flood of unprofitable and time consuming repricings and refinancings. Gaining Ground A second bid is expected to gain ground from a number of hedge funds that only tendered a minimum number of shares the first time round. They held back shares either because they viewed being a minority shareholder as an economically attractive trade or because they speculated on securing a higher price for any remaining stock after a successful initial tender offer. A second offer is likely to see the hedge funds tender a larger number of shares, having lost money after Stada’s share price fell following the failed sale, the sources said. “It was high stakes poker that didn’t work. The hedge funds are sitting on losses and might be willing to tender more in renewed bid,” a second source said. Once the acceptance level is met, index funds accounting for a chunk of the shareholder base are expected to sell their shares. “It is impossible for them to tender as they can only really sell when liquidity in the stock is below a certain level. They will sell shares once the conditional acceptance is met,” the second source said. The tender offer for the agreed €5.3bn deal at €66 per share was made conditional on securing 67.5% of the shares, after the minimum acceptance threshold was lowered earlier in June from 75%. For 2017, Stada expects sales adjusted for currency and portfolio effects of €2.28bn to €2.35bn, with adjusted Ebitda of €430m-€450m, Thomson Reuters reported previously.

The measures, which European and U.S. officials said would begin taking effect within three weeks, could replace the in-cabin ban on laptops and other large electronics on direct flights to the United States from the Middle East. Lifting the ban would be a welcome reprieve for Middle East carrier which have seen demand to the United States weakened by travel restrictions imposed by President Donald Trump's administration.  We welcome the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s latest directive on enhanced screening measures,  an Emirates spokeswoman said in a statement.  We look forward to working with the authorities and Dubai airport stakeholders to implement these measures as soon as possible for our U.S. flights.” Rival Etihad Airways said the pre-clearance facility at its Abu Dhabi International Airport hub, which clears passengers through U.S. immigration before departure, adheres to the short-term measures outlined in the new directive.  We look forward to working with the TSA (Transportation Security Administration) and verifying that the security measures are in place which will see the ban lifted on personal electronic devices being carried in the cabin on our flights to the U.S.,  a spokesman for the Abu Dhabi-based carrier said. In March, laptops were banned from the cabins of flights to the United States originating at 10 airports in the Middle East, including Abu Dhabi International and Emirates' Dubai International Airport hub, to address fears that bombs could be concealed in electronic devices taken aboard aircraft. The 10 Middle East airports where laptops are banned from the cabin on U.S. flights will be able to get off the list if they meet the new security requirements, Homeland Security officials said on Wednesday.  Lifting the ban on bringing laptops and other personal electronic devices onboard will be good news for travelers flying into the U.S.,  Emirates' spokeswoman said. U.S. authorities want increased security protocols around aircraft and in passenger areas, expanded canine screening and additional places where travelers can be cleared by U.S. officials before they depart.  European and U.S. officials told Reuters that airlines have 21 days to put in place increased explosive trace detection screening and have 120 days to comply with other security measures, including enhanced screening of airline passengers.

Porte, who joined BMC Racing from Team Sky in 2016, is seen as the man most likely to stop Briton Froome over the next three weeks and general manager Jim Ochowicz said his team's  singular goal  is to put the 32-year-old on the podium. In Olympic road champion Greg van Avermaet, this year's Tour de Suisse runner-up Damiano Caruso and former Sky man Nicolas Roche, Porte has a powerful unit behind him and he oozed confidence at a news conference on Thursday.  It's a massive opportunity for me,  the Tasmanian told reporters inside a huge conference hall alongside the River Rhine, not far from the site of Saturday's Grand Depart.  It's the first time in my career I have a fully dedicated team to me so it's my chance to have as good a crack as winning this race as possible.  I think I'm closer to (Froome) this year. I've beaten him in the races I've done so far, but that doesn't count for anything once you get to July 1, that's another level.  He is the defending champion and for me the big favorite.  Porte out-rode Froome during the Criterium du Dauphine, often seen as a barometer of form going into the Tour. Twelve months ago, he lost nearly 2 minutes after a puncture on the second stage but still ended up fifth after matching Froome over the punishing climbs of the Pyrenees and Alps. This year's route includes only three summit finishes and Porte, who announced on Thursday he had signed a one-year contract extension, believes the race will be less easy for Team Sky to control.  It could be a free-for-all,  he said.  On paper it's not the average Tour de France so it could all come down to the time trial in Marseilles (on the penultimate day of the Tour).  It's not going to be an easy lap around France. There will be good battles, like on the stage into Chambery. It's not a perfect parcours but whoever wins it will be a worthy winner.  With the usual mind games going on in the build-up to the start - Team Sky have named Porte as favorite - the Australian just wants get on his bike and ride.  They are just playing a game,  he said.  Behind closed doors they think they have the guy to win it. And he knows how to win it. He'll be better than at the Dauphine.  I'm just excited to get it started to be honest.  Classics expert van Avermaet, who won a stunning gold in Rio last year, thinks Porte has every chance to break Sky's grip.  The main goal is to support Richie and get him in yellow and he has the capability to do it,  the Belgian said.

The contract with Volkswagen's (VOWG_p.DE) upscale Audi division underlines increased spending by automakers on technology designed to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, in response to tightening standards and testing regimes. Volkswagen and Valeo both declined to comment. Unlike a typical alternator, which converts engine torque to electricity to power a vehicle's circuitry and charge its battery, the starter-alternator can also re-start the engine in a fraction of a second. The Valeo system delivers fuel savings of up to 15 percent by automatically shutting down the engine whenever a car is halted by a red light or traffic, with an in-step reduction of CO2 and pollution emissions in congested cities. First introduced in 2004, the so-called  i-StARS  technology is a flagship product of Valeo's 4 billion euro ($4.6 billion)propulsion systems division, with 3 million units sold. But launch customer PSA Group (PEUP.PA) and other volume manufacturers have since dropped it from new models in favor of beefed-up starter motors, a cheaper though less efficient stop-and-start solution. The i-StARS system is beginning to find new markets, however, Valeo boss Jacques Aschenbroich told Reuters.  Demand for it is continuing to grow significantly,  the CEO said, predicting double-digit percentage sales rise. With the mild-hybrid RS5, which went on sale this month in Germany and in France next week, Audi becomes the first German premium brand to use the technology on its current vehicle lineup.

The measures, which European and U.S. officials said would begin taking effect within three weeks, could replace the in-cabin ban on laptops and other large electronics on direct flights to the United States from the Middle East. Lifting the ban would be a welcome reprieve for Middle East carrier which have seen demand to the United States weakened by travel restrictions imposed by President Donald Trump's administration.  We welcome the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s latest directive on enhanced screening measures,  an Emirates spokeswoman said in a statement.  We look forward to working with the authorities and Dubai airport stakeholders to implement these measures as soon as possible for our U.S. flights.” Rival Etihad Airways said the pre-clearance facility at its Abu Dhabi International Airport hub, which clears passengers through U.S. immigration before departure, adheres to the short-term measures outlined in the new directive.  We look forward to working with the TSA (Transportation Security Administration) and verifying that the security measures are in place which will see the ban lifted on personal electronic devices being carried in the cabin on our flights to the U.S.,  a spokesman for the Abu Dhabi-based carrier said. In March, laptops were banned from the cabins of flights to the United States originating at 10 airports in the Middle East, including Abu Dhabi International and Emirates' Dubai International Airport hub, to address fears that bombs could be concealed in electronic devices taken aboard aircraft. The 10 Middle East airports where laptops are banned from the cabin on U.S. flights will be able to get off the list if they meet the new security requirements, Homeland Security officials said on Wednesday.  Lifting the ban on bringing laptops and other personal electronic devices onboard will be good news for travellers flying into the U.S.,  Emirates' spokeswoman said. U.S. authorities want increased security protocols around aircraft and in passenger areas, expanded canine screening and additional places where travellers can be cleared by U.S. officials before they depart. European and U.S. officials told Reuters that airlines have 21 days to put in place increased explosive trace detection screening and have 120 days to comply with other security measures, including enhanced screening of airline passengers.

The contract with Volkswagen's (VOWG_p.DE) upscale Audi division underlines increased spending by automakers on technology designed to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, in response to tightening standards and testing regimes. Volkswagen and Valeo both declined to comment. Unlike a typical alternator, which converts engine torque to electricity to power a vehicle's circuitry and charge its battery, the starter-alternator can also re-start the engine in a fraction of a second. The Valeo system delivers fuel savings of up to 15 percent by automatically shutting down the engine whenever a car is halted by a red light or traffic, with an in-step reduction of CO2 and pollution emissions in congested cities. First introduced in 2004, the so-called  i-StARS  technology is a flagship product of Valeo's 4 billion euro ($4.6 billion)propulsion systems division, with 3 million units sold. But launch customer PSA Group (PEUP.PA) and other volume manufacturers have since dropped it from new models in favor of beefed-up starter motors, a cheaper though less efficient stop-and-start solution. The i-StARS system is beginning to find new markets, however, Valeo boss Jacques Aschenbroich told Reuters.  Demand for it is continuing to grow significantly,  the CEO said, predicting double-digit percentage sales rise. With the mild-hybrid RS5, which went on sale this month in Germany and in France next week, Audi becomes the first German premium brand to use the technology on its current vehicle lineup.

The directive defined close family as a parent, spouse, child, adult son or daughter, son-in-law, daughter-in-law or sibling, including step-siblings and other step-family relations, according to a cable distributed to all U.S. diplomatic posts on Wednesday and seen by Reuters. Close family  does not include grandparents, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, cousins, brothers-in-law and sisters-in-law, fiancés, and any other 'extended' family members,  according to the cable, first reported by the Associated Press. Immigration experts noted that fiancés, grandparents and grandchildren did not qualify as a close family relationship. It also specified that the relationship with a U.S. entity  must be formal, documented, and formed in the ordinary course, rather than for the purpose of evading the E.O.,  referring to the executive order signed by U.S. President Donald Trump on March 6 that barred most U.S. travel by citizens of the six nations for 90 days. The cable advises U.S. consular officers on how to interpret Monday's Supreme Court ruling that allowed parts of the executive order, which had been blocked by the lower courts, to be implemented while the highest U.S. court considers the matter. The six nations included in the executive order are Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen. The travel ban will go into effect at 8 p.m. EDT (midnight GMT) on Thursday, the cable said. (Read the cable at: here) Asked about the guidance issued on Wednesday night, the State Department declined to comment on internal communications. The cable's language closely mirrored the Supreme Court's order on the travel ban, but appeared to be a narrow interpretation in some areas, notably in defining close family. It was unclear on Wednesday evening whether the State Department's interpretation of the court's order would spark further legal action by opponents of the ban. Several immigration lawyers expressed surprise on Wednesday evening that fiancés, grandparents and grandchildren were not covered.  This language is extremely disappointing,  said Johnathan Smith, legal director at Muslim Advocates, a civil rights group.  Defining close family to exclude grandparents, cousins, and other relatives defies common sense and directly goes against the intent of the Supreme Court's order.  The directive gave several examples of what might constitute a bona fide relationship with a U.S. entity, and said broad categories would be exempt from the travel ban, such as people eligible for student visas,  as their bona fide relationship to a person or entity is inherent in the visa classification.  Similarly, those eligible for family or employment-based immigrant visa applications are exempt from the travel ban, the cable said.  A worker who accepted an offer of employment from a company in the United States or a lecturer invited to address an audience in the United States would be exempt  from the ban, the order said, but someone who simply made a hotel reservation would not be considered as having a bona fide relationship. Trump's executive order also imposed a 120-day ban on entry to the United States by refugees. The Supreme Court order, however, said the ban did not cover those refugees  who can credibly claim a bona fide relationship with a person or entity  in the United States. The State Department guidance was unclear on what U.S. refugee agencies regard as a key question: whether their own dealings with refugees applying to come to the United States constituted a bona fide relationship. Consulates should continue to interview applicants for so-called diversity visas, which are granted to individuals from countries that typically do not send many people to the United States, according to the cable. In 2015, around 10,500 citizens from the six banned countries were selected for the diversity visa lottery, according to State Department figures. The travel ban will likely bar such visas for citizens of the six countries, the cable acknowledged, stating that  we anticipate that very few DV applicants are likely to be exempt from the E.O.’s suspension of entry or to qualify for a waiver.

Giancarlo, a Republican, received bipartisan support from the panel, with 16 members voting in his favor and only five Democrats dissenting. Committee Chairman Pat Roberts on Thursday described Giancarlo as  abundantly qualified,  while ranking Democrat Debbie Stabenow praised him for showing he could work  on a bipartisan basis.  Giancarlo has already been acting chairman of the CFTC since January, after President Donald Trump took office. In March, Trump nominated him as permanent chairman of the regulator tasked with policing the massive over-the-counter derivatives market. Since then, Trump has nominated two other commissioners to fill the remaining two Republican vacancies on the five-member panel - Brian Quintenz, a former fund manager and congressional policy adviser, and Dawn Stump, a former vice president of NYSE Euronext, now part of Intercontinental Exchange Inc. Former president Barack Obama had also nominated Quintenz to the post, but the nomination never made it to the Senate floor for a vote. The Senate panel has not yet held a confirmation hearing for either nominee. Trump has yet to announce candidates to fill the two vacant spots reserved for Democrats.

The index is expected to edge up to set a new high by the middle of 2018, a Reuters poll found on Thursday, boosted by moderate economic growth offsetting depressed oil prices and worries about the country's housing market. On the day, nine of the index's 10 main groups were in negative territory, with only the healthcare group rising. Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc jumped 5 percent to C$23.52 after it said it had completed the sale of its Dendreon subsidiary and that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had accepted unit Salix Pharmaceuticals' marketing application for bowel cleanser drug, Plenvu. Teck Resources Ltd also gained, up 3.5 percent to C$23.26, after agreeing to buy a Mexican mine from a subsidiary of Goldcorp Inc, which fell 3 percent to C$16.86. The energy group retreated 0.7 percent despite higher oil prices, while the materials group, which includes precious and base metals miners and fertilizer companies, lost 1.2 percent.

Slideshow (17 Images) I think for me I've realized the responsibility of being a role model for young kids everywhere,  Holland told reporters, adding that the character's motto that  with great power comes great responsibility , resonated with him.    The film is the first time that Spider-Man, one of Disney-owned Marvel's most popular characters, is the lead in a film set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.  Kevin Feige, the president of Marvel Studios, championed the cause of getting Spider-Man into the Disney-run sphere.  Now we have the first time Spider-Man in the Marvel Universe where he belongs,  he stated at the premiere, adding  I sort of am still pinching myself. I can't believe it. I can't believe we're premiering the movie tonight and I can't wait for people to see it.  The film sees  Iron Man  actor Robert Downey Jr, another staple of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, who has featured in several of the series' films, taking a co-starring role alongside Holland.

By Saad  Sayeed ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - One Spanish man and an Argentinian have gone missing on a notoriously treacherous peak in northern Pakistan known among mountaineers as  Killer Mountain , officials said on Tuesday. Alberto Zerain Berasategi from Spain and Mariano Galvan from Argentina were last heard from on Saturday when their party was climbing Nanga Parbat, the world's ninth highest mountain, Karrar Haidri, spokesman for the Alpine Club of Pakistan, said.  They went to the high camp and we have not been able to contact them since,  the head of tourism for Gilgit-Baltistan region, Iqbal Hussain, said. He said authorities hoped to begin a helicopter search on Wednesday. Pakistan rivals Nepal for the number of peaks over 7,000 meters (23,000 feet) and is home to the world's second-highest mountain, K2, as well as three others which are among the world's 14 summits higher than 8,000 meters. Nanga Parbat, 8,126 meters high, was the scene of an attack in 2013, when gunmen dressed as police officers shot 10 foreign mountaineers and a local guide at the 4,200-metre base camp. The killings were claimed by both the Pakistani Taliban and a smaller group of Islamist militants. Since that attack, the number of expeditions has dwindled, wrecking communities dependent on climbing tourism for income and depriving Pakistan's economy of much-needed dollars.

Cut-price fashion giant Primark, H&M;, Lidl and umbrella brand Inditex, which owns Zara and Massimo Dutti, are among the 13 retailers that extended a raft of existing standards and agreed on new terms. The accord covers more than 1,000 factories in Bangladesh and will run for three years from May 2018.  More companies are expected to sign over coming weeks in a deal covering up to 2 million garment workers. The agreement adds protections for workers who lobby for safer working conditions and extends factory inspections to cover spinning mills as well as washing and dying facilities. Bangladesh is home to about 4 million garment workers, who make cheap, throwaway fashion items and household goods for export to big-name stores. Many of the factories draw criticism for offering a regime of scant worker rights, lax safety standards, long hours and poor pay.  In the Rana Plaza disaster, one of the worst ever industrial accidents, 1,135 people were killed when an eight-story building housing five factories collapsed. The collapse of the complex, built on swampy ground outside the capital Dhaka, sparked demands for greater safety in the world's second-largest exporter of ready-made garments and put pressure on companies that buy clothing from Bangladesh.  Bumps in the Road  Unions and retailers concede more must be done - activists say garment workers continue to be abused - but heralded Thursday's agreement as a step forward.  The accord has not yet met all of its goals, but it has already distinguished itself as a huge advance over all the initiatives that preceded it,  said Lynda Yanz, director of the labor rights group Maquila Solidarity Network.  The agreement has been challenging to implement and it has encountered many bumps in the road, with renovations running well behind schedule in many instances. However, the progress achieved is real, it involves tens of thousands of documented safety improvements and it has reduced risks for millions of workers,  she said in a statement. The previous Bangladesh Accord, signed in 2013, paved the way for fire, electrical and structural safety inspections in more than 1,500 factories and set out plans for the installation of fire doors and stronger buildings. But nearly four years on, more than 80 percent of factories are running late on renovations, the accord said on its website.  Global fashion retailers say the Dhaka tragedy prompted them to come together to protect workers in developing nations and ensure the safety of buildings.

The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) said in a statement that any intervention, which its board must approve, would come into effect next January at the earliest. The ESMA said it has been concerned about products including contracts-for-difference (CFDs), rolling spot forex, and binary options for retail investors for a considerable period of time. CFDs allow people to bet on moves in share prices without having to buy the underlying stock. Binary options are a bet on whether a stock or other instrument will trade above or below a set level in future. Some national regulators have introduced limits on leverage, guaranteed limits on customer losses, and imposed restrictions on the marketing and distribution of such products. The ESMA said any action it takes would reflect this. Britain's Financial Conduct Authority sent stocks of firms in the sector tumbling last December after saying it had found evidence of poor conduct across the market. People buying CFDs lost 2,200 pounds ($3,000) a year on average, the FCA said. The British watchdog has already launched a public consultation on regulating CFDs but on Thursday said it would delay the publication of its final rules as its proposals were broadly similar to what the ESMA was discussing.  In the event of a significant delay to possible ESMA measures, the FCA would reconsider making final rules at a domestic level in the first half of 2018,  the FCA said. The FCA will publish its review into firms selling and distributing CFDs in the near future.

It was not immediately clear how the proposed renegotiation of contracts would affect a planned $30 billion gas project, or the troubled mining sector, which generates about 3.5 percent of Tanzania's gross domestic product. Businesses have complained that they feel President John Magufuli is unfairly squeezing them through a strict interpretation of tax laws, increased fines and demands they rapidly list on the local stock exchange. Magufuli says the reforms will increase transparency and revenues and that the companies have not been paying their fair share of taxes, charges they strongly deny. The three bills, expected to be fast-tracked, cover natural resources contracts, sovereignty and amend existing laws and would allow the government to renegotiate or dissolve contracts.  This is unprecedented in terms of an escalation and an assault on the mining sector,  said Ahmed Salim, vice president of global advisory firm Teneo Intelligence.  There hasn’t been much dialogue between the private sector and government. Major companies in Tanzania, both foreign and domestic, mostly wake up to news about major changes in legislation and regulation alterations ... This will have very severe consequences in terms of foreign investment.  Companies Affected Companies that could be affected include BG Group, part of Royal Dutch Shell, Exxon Mobil, Statoil and Ophir Energy. They plan to build a $30 billion liquefied natural gas (LNG) export terminal in partnership with state-run Tanzania Petroleum Development Corp. The bill on natural wealth and resources reads:  Where the government has served notice of intention to renegotiate the arrangement or agreement ... and the other party fails to agree to renegotiate the unconscionable terms or no agreement is reached ... such terms shall cease to have effect and shall be treated as having been expunged.  It defines  unconscionable terms  as anything that is  contrary to good conscience and the enforceability of which jeopardises the interests of the people  of Tanzania. The bills reject international arbitration - a standard requirement of many international deals - and stipulate that any renegotiation must be completed within 90 days or that section of the contract is void. The parliamentary session has been extended for several days to allow lawmakers to study the bills and approve them, National Assembly Speaker Job Ndugai said. Tanzania is Africa's fourth-largest gold producer and has made vast natural gas discoveries but remains one of the poorest countries in the world. Mining companies that could be affected by the proposed law changes include AngloGold Ashanti, Acacia Mining Plc and Petra Diamonds. Acacia, which has most of its operations in Tanzania, has been a particular target of Magufuli's ire. Its share price has nearly halved since March 3, when the government banned it from exporting minerals in a row over taxes. Acacia and AngloGold said they were studying the legislation. Acacia also said talks with the government on the export ban were  yet to begin .

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistani rescuers were searching on Wednesday for a Spanish man and an Argentinian who went missing on a notoriously treacherous Himalayan peak known as  Killer Mountain , an official said.  A ground team began searching for Alberto Zerain Berasategi from Spain and Mariano Galvan from Argentina but helicopters could not join the search effort due to poor weather, said Karrar Haidri, spokesman for the Alpine Club of Pakistan. The two men, who were part of a 13-strong expedition that set out last month to climb the 8,126 meter Nanga Parbat, the world's ninth highest mountain, were last heard from on Saturday.  The rest of their party had returned to base camp, Haidri confirmed.   In such weather conditions and without adequate food supply, survival appears unlikely but there was the case of Tomaz Humar a few years ago,  Haidari said, adding that rescue officials are doing everything possible to find the men.  Slovenian mountaineer Humar was trapped on Nanga Parbat for six days in 2005 before army helicopters found him trapped under a ledge at a height of nearly 6000 meters.  Pakistan rivals Nepal for the number of peaks over 7,000 meters (23,000 feet) and is home to the world's second-highest mountain, K2, as well as three others which are among the world's 14 summits higher than 8,000 meters.

Carrefour, the world's second-largest retailer behind Wal-Mart, plans to list the Atacadao business on July 20 on the Sao Paulo exchange with a 15-20 percent free float and an indicative price tag of 15 to 19 reais per share.. This would give the Brazilian arm an equity value of 7.9 billion to 10 billion euros, compared to market estimates of around 9 billion euros ($10.3 billion), analysts said. Carrefour had already flagged that it was targeting the Brazilian IPO this year to accelerate its expansion in the South American country, its second-largest market after France. Carrefour shares initially rose but then lost ground to stand 1.4 percent lower at 22.12 euros by mid-afternoon, with analysts signalling that the valuation of the Brazilian business had only met earlier market forecasts, rather than beating them.  We are valuing Carrefour Brazil at 9 billion euros or 8 times EV/EBITDA (enterprise value to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation), so do not see the valuation range as surprising,  said Deutsche Bank analysts in a note, keeping a  hold  rating on Carrefour shares. Analysts at Bernstein, who kept a  market perform  rating on Carrefour, also said that much of the impact from the Brazilian IPO had already been factored into Carrefour's stock price. Bernstein analysts said in an updated note that pricing at the top of the indicative range would add 2.5 euros to its 'Sum Of The Parts' (SOTP) price for Carrefour, while an IPO at the bottom part of that range would add 0.2 euros to that price. Deutsche Bank expects the IPO proceeds to strengthen Carrefour Brazil's balance sheet  by reimbursing gradually between 500 million and 1 billion euros of intercompany debt with Carrefour,  and help fund possible acquisitions in Brazil. Morgan Stanley said Carrefour's Brazil business was a strong asset which was likely to attract significant interest from investors.  One of the potential risks to Atacadao's equity story, though, is that it might want to rely too aggressively on acquisitions to accelerate its expansion,  added Morgan Stanley, keeping an  equal-weight  rating. Carrefour added that because of the Brazilian IPO, it was bringing forward its second-quarter sales figures to July 6 from July 12. It will release first-half earnings on August 30.

The ruling Social Democrats plan to replace a flat 16 percent corporate tax on profit with a multi-levelled tax on turnover and introduce  a solidarity contribution  next year, a revised governing programme showed.     They also plan to liquidate a mandatory private pension system that was introduced in 2008 to supplement ailing state pensions.     Romania's economy grew at the fastest rate in central Europe in the first quarter, but political turmoil and policy uncertainty have weighed on its markets in the past weeks.      The new tax and private pension plans, which had not been discussed with businesses beforehand, brought additional unpredictability to edgy investors on Thursday.     By 1249 GMT the leu fell 0.5 percent, underperforming its regional peers, while the Romanian stock market index was down 2 percent.     Mihai Tudose was named prime minister on Monday after the ruling parties sacked former premier Sorin Grindeanu on June 21 for failing to implement an ambitious programme that helped the coalition parties win a December election.      A majority of ministers from the ousted cabinet feature in the new government lineup. It is likely to receive approval given the comfortable parliamentary majority held by the ruling Social Democrat Party (PSD) and its junior partner ALDE.     The confidence vote is expected later on Thursday.      Politics is expected to impact the Romanian currency in the longer term, an analyst said.      Even if this (vote today) brings an end to the government crisis for now, politics remain a factor of uncertainty in Romania,  Commerzbank said in a note.      The case of the previous government illustrated just how quickly Dragnea can withdraw his support.      Romania's strong economic growth, however, could support the leu, Commerzbank added.      Focus is now likely to increasingly rest on the positive fundamental environment, and we see appreciation potential for RON,  it added.     The Czech central bank kept its key interest rate unchanged near zero on Thursday as expected.     The bank said it was likely to raise interest rates for the first time in almost a decade in the third quarter, in line with its current economic outlook.     Several of the bank's board members, including Governor Jiri Rusnok, have said previously that the tightening might come after the third quarter if the crown currency appreciates significantly.     On Thursday, Rusnok said the crown exchange remained a significant source of uncertainty, after the central bank freed it in April from a currency cap that kept it weak.      The crown was trading half a percent stronger at 1240 GMT on Thursday.      A dealer said markets, which have been pricing in later rate hikes, may start taking the central bank rhetoric more seriously  but (it is) probably not necessary to push EURCZK too low...when the CNB may change the timing (of rate hikes).

But men also control use of the water in local dams, so when drought hits it is the cattle that get the water – and the goats and chickens that die. “The men block access to the dam for the women, saying there’s not enough water to ensure the survival of goats and cattle, so that means goats have to stay away,” said Ronald Wesso, who leads research and policy for Oxfam South Africa. But goats are hardier animals in times of drought, so protecting them makes more efficient use of limited resources, Wesso said.  And because a greater number of people own them – particularly women, who are often more financially vulnerable – giving goats priority in access to water and emergency fodder programs during drought spreads the benefits more widely. So a push by Oxfam to have more government and other drought relief directed to goat owners makes sense – except that, as it turns out, it could undermine a traditional system of cattle owners helping their neighbors and relatives in times of drought. “In times of stress, neighbors turn to (cattle owners) as a source of support. These male cattle owners are key to the resilience of the community in responding to drought,” Wesso said. “So what you’re trying to do in essence is put in place a new system of resilience counter to an existing one that you might have problems with but that is there and that people depend on,” he said. Building better resilience to the greater shocks and stresses that climate change is bringing can be a complicated and confusing task, researchers said this week at an Oxford conference aimed at exploring resilient solutions to growing problems. Winners - and Losers Often efforts to build resilience can produce losers as well as winners, or are built assuming government will make choices for the good of greater numbers of people, when in fact political alliances, corruption, nepotism and other problems mean that is often not the case, they said. “Issues like corruption stand in the way of planning working as it should, and we have to acknowledge that,” said Richard Friend, a human geographer who has worked extensively in Asia and now lectures at the University of York.  “Everybody knows it doesn’t work the way it should on paper,  he said. In other cases, time frames are the problem: If sea level rise is slowly flooding fields, when is it right to switch to salt-resistant crops and when is it time to encourage farmers to move on to other jobs? Some efforts to build resilience – the “no regrets” options, such as giving people better education – work regardless of what is coming. In other cases delaying decisions or hedging them can be effective, said Lisa Horrocks, a climate change consultant with Mott MacDonald, a management consultancy group. But when it comes to deciding where to put a new city, whether to build a large dam or what kind of energy system to invest in, decisions “need to last well into the future and we don’t know what the future will be”, she said. “For shorter-term decisions, incremental adaptation may be appropriate,” she said. But for longer-term issues, really different ways of doing things may be needed, she said. Bounce Back Better? Nick Brooks, the director of Garama 3C, a climate change and development consultancy, said that working to understand where thresholds lie – the point at which an existing way of doing things ceases to work, for instance – is crucial to building resilience that lasts. “Normally we talk about building resilience for existing systems, to allow them to be sustained in the face of shocks. That’s appropriate in some cases,” he said. “But there may be cases where trying to build the resilience of existing systems doesn’t work,” he said. He also questioned the frequent aim of helping people “bounce back” after shocks, such as a drought or flooding. That may not always be the right approach for really poor people, who were struggling to survive even before the crisis hit and who need to become “more resilient than they were before the shock”, he said. Eva Ludi, a senior researcher at the Overseas Development Institute, a London-based think-tank, warned that projects to improve resilience often start with basic assumptions that can be wrong.  One such assumption is that herders who see their animals die during droughts should diversify their sources of income into things like growing a few crops – something most don’t want to do. Instead it’s best to look at what’s already starting to happen on the ground – such as new ways of trading livestock or processing livestock products – for ideas, she said, and to remember that informal networks may have ideas as good or better than governments and more formal organizations.     Arabella Fraser, a specialist in urban climate adaptation and resilience at the Overseas Development Institute, said one way to try to make resilience building efforts work more effectively is to keep a few principles in mind. They include working hard to really understand who has power and how the economy works, taking the time to build long-term trust with partners, and acknowledging that there will be trade-offs and not everything will succeed as planned, she said.

Shares of the top six U.S. banks rose after the Federal Reserve cleared them in the second part of its annual stress test, allowing them to raise dividend payouts and share buybacks. The financial index led the two gainers among the 11 S&P; 500 sectors, rising 1.74 percent.  The banks will be in the spotlight today as all of the U.S. banks passed the stress test,  said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial in New York. Wall Street rallied sharply on Wednesday, with the benchmark S&P; 500 index scoring its biggest one-day percentage gain in about two months, as financial and technology stocks led a broad market rebound. The Nasdaq posted on Wednesday its best session since Nov. 7, the day before the U.S. presidential election. Tech stocks, which have led the S&P; 500's 9-percent gain this year, pulled back recently as some investors questioned the sector's high valuations. Nine S&P; 500 sectors were lower, with the technology index's 0.85 percent fall leading the decliners. Apple, Alphabet and Microsoft were the biggest drags on the Nasdaq and the S&P.; At 9:40 a.m. ET (1340 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 12.99 points, or 0.06 percent, at 21,467.6, the S&P; 500 was down 1.82 points, or 0.07 percent, at 2,438.87. The Nasdaq Composite was down 27.94 points, or 0.45 percent, at 6,206.47. Oil prices rose to a two-week high, extending the rally into the sixth straight session, after a decline in weekly U.S. production eased concerns about deepening oversupply. The markets were little changed after data showed the U.S. economy slowed less sharply in the first quarter than initially estimated due to unexpectedly higher consumer spending and a bigger jump in exports. The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits edged up last week, but the underlying trend remained consistent with a tight labor market.

New York-based Blue Apron said late on Wednesday its initial public offering of 30 million shares of class A common stock was priced at $10 per share, at the low end of the $10 to $11 per share range issued earlier in the day. It lowered the estimate from a range of $15 to $17 after potential investors expressed concerns about the $13.7 billion Amazon deal as well as Blue Apron's marketing costs and lack of profitability, people familiar with the matter said. They requested anonymity because the pricing negotiations were confidential. Blue Apron is the first U.S. meal-kit company to go public. Smaller peers and their venture capital investors were hoping it would pave the way for them to also go public or be acquired at rich valuations. The IPO values Blue Apron at $1.89 billion, below the $3.2 billion implied by its previous estimate and the $2.2 billion by its last private fundraising round two years ago. Amazon already has a small meal-kit business, delivering ingredients and recipes to customers in a handful of U.S. cities. The Whole Foods deal announced in mid-June would hand the e-commerce company a ready-made distribution system for food delivery in the form of brick-and-mortar grocery stores.  Amazon's deal for Whole Foods earlier this month added to concerns, but Blue Apron's high marketing costs were a negative factor. Snap Inc's (SNAP.N) IPO earlier this year has shown investors that growth at all costs is a mistake,  said Kathleen Smith, principal of Renaissance Capital LLC, a manager of IPO-focused exchange-traded funds. Snap went public in March and surged in its first day of trading, but shares are now just above their IPO price after declining revenue growth and widening losses raised questions about whether the Snapchat app owner would ever be profitable.  Like other meal-kit companies, Blue Apron has spent heavily on marketing to compete for customers who often switch service providers, or cancel their subscriptions altogether. The company spent roughly 18 percent of its $795.4 million revenue in 2016 on marketing, posting a net loss of $54.9 million. It has also faced steep costs of building out delivery infrastructure for fresh food. While meal kits have not been a focus for Amazon, it started investing in the sector earlier this year and has launched a partnership with Martha Stewart's meal kit service, Martha & Marley Spoon, to deliver Stewart-designed meals in New York, San Francisco, Dallas and Philadelphia, Boston, Washington, Seattle and Los Angeles. Amazon has not specified its plans for Whole Foods stores, but industry insiders believe they could serve as distribution points for fresh food delivery. Amazon's significant investment in automation is also likely to give it a leg-up in managing costs. The Blue Apron logo is pictured ahead of the company's IPO on the New York Stock Exchange in New York, U.S., June 29, 2017.Lucas Jackson With Amazon as their potential main competitor, this may make that long-term profit target more difficult than before the (Whole Foods) merger,  said Eric Kim, co-founder and managing partner of venture capital firm Goodwater Capital.  A meal-kit delivery company hoping to follow Blue Apron was Sun Basket, which Reuters reported earlier this year had hired banks to prepare for an IPO. Green Chef and Home Chef are two other meal-kit companies reviewing options, including a sale or raising funds, Reuters has reported. The challenge of balancing marketing and operational costs with affordable pricing has already claimed victims in the industry. Startup Maple said it was shutting down earlier this year, while SpoonRocket made a similar announcement last year. Slideshow (5 Images)Shares in the broader consumer sector have shown signs of weakness in the past month. The S&P; index of consumer discretionary companies .SPLRCD rose 13 percent over the first five months of 2017, but is down about 2.5 percent since its peak on June 2. Valued at a Discount to E-Commerce Firms Online sales represented only $12 billion, or 2.2 percent, of the U.S. restaurant market in 2016, but are expected to grow about 22.6 percent annually from 2017 to 2020, Blue Apron has said, citing a Euromonitor study it commissioned. During an IPO road show last week, Blue Apron sought to convince investors it was well positioned to benefit from growing consumer interest in cooking and where their food comes from. Following the negative investor feedback, Blue Apron slashed its pricing estimate. The IPO puts Blue Apron's valuation at roughly 1.6 times the revenue, according to Goodwater Capital. While that would represent a discount to e-commerce companies which on average command 3.1 times 2017 revenue, it would still mark a premium to grocery players, which trade at roughly 0.7 times 2017 revenue, Goodwater said. Bessemer Venture Partners, Stripes Group and Fidelity are among Blue Apron's investors. Blue Apron shares are expected to begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday under the symbol APRN. Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup and Barclays are among the underwriters to the IPO.

BHP entered the shale business at the height of the fracking boom in 2011 and invested billions more developing the operations. The fall in oil prices since then has led to pre-tax writedowns of about $13 billion on the business.    Activist shareholder and hedge fund Elliott Management, holding 4.1 percent of BHP's London-listed shares, has been trying to gain support from other shareholders to persuade BHP to sell the shale oil and gas business.   If you had to turn the clock back, and if we knew what we knew today, we wouldn't do it, of course we wouldn't do it, but go back and put yourself in our position at that time,  Nasser told a business seminar, referring to the shale purchase.  We bought exactly what we thought we were buying, but the timing was way off.  New York-based Elliott has directed a barrage of criticism at the global miner since releasing a list of changes in April it wants the company to implement. Its list includes an exit from shale, removal of BHP's dual London and Australian stock listings and greater emphasis on shareholder returns.    Nasser would not comment on Elliott's proposal. But he defended BHP's performance, saying the company's shareholder returns were up 486 percent since BHP merged with Billiton Plc in 2001. BHP Chief Executive Andrew Mackenzie told a conference in May the company was considering divesting some shale acreage, although it believed the assets were  well-placed for the future.  Australian wealth management group Escala and fund Tribeca Investment Partners have also campaigned for a revamp at BHP, calling for board changes and reviews of the energy operations.    Nasser, a former head of Ford Motor Co. is scheduled to retire as chairman on Sept. 1. The appointment of Nasser's successor, Ken MacKenzie, a former packaging industry executive, has been welcomed by Elliott as a  constructive step in bringing much needed change to the direction of BHP.

European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said on Tuesday the ECB might tweak its stimulus so it does not become more accommodative as the economy recovers, though sources said on Wednesday he had not intended to signal imminent tightening.                               Also on Wednesday, Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said a rise in British interest rates is likely to be needed as the economy comes closer to running at full capacity.                  Germany's 10-year government bond yield rose             to a seven-week high, dragging Treasury yields higher with it.                  “What’s going on in Europe is really what’s driving us here,” said Brian Daingerfield, a macro strategist at NatWest Markets in Stamford, Connecticut.     Benchmark 10-year notes             were last down 19/32 in price to yield 2.29 percent, the highest since May 24 and up from 2.22 percent late on Wednesday.     Attention is expected to return to the U.S. economy on Friday when personal income and consumption data will be evaluated for inflation signals.     The yield curve has flattened dramatically in the past month on concerns about weakening price pressures.     “Tomorrow’s PCE (Personal Consumption Expenditures) deflator print is going to be an important read for markets in trying to assess how much patience the Fed can have for assessing when to make their next move on rates,” said Daingerfield.     The yield curve between five-year notes and 30-year bonds                steepened to 96.40 basis points on Thursday, after falling as low as 91.90 basis points on Wednesday, the flattest since late 2007.     Data on Thursday showed the U.S. economy slowed less sharply in the first quarter than initially estimated due to unexpectedly higher consumer spending and a bigger jump in exports.

Gains for the loonie came after it scored on Wednesday its biggest advance in three months, boosted by hawkish comments from Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz.                  Chances of a rate hike next month have increased to 44 percent from just 20 percent after subdued inflation data on Friday, data from the overnight index swaps market shows.                By the end of the year, the market has fully discounted a rate hike and is about one-third priced for a second tightening.     Prices of oil, one of Canada's major exports, rose to a two-week high, after a decline in weekly U.S. production eased concerns about deepening oversupply.                  U.S. crude        prices were up 0.78 percent at $45.09 a barrel.

The currency's weakest level of the session was C$1.3044, while it touched its strongest since Feb. 3 at C$1.3006.     The total number of non-farm payroll employees rose by 4,800 in April from March, data from Statistics Canada showed.     Canada's gross domestic product data for April and the Bank of Canada's business outlook report are due on Friday.              Canadian government bond prices lower across a steeper yield curve in sympathy with U.S. Treasuries and German Bunds, pressured by the view that global central banks are becoming less accommodative.

Trump,USA,ECONOMY,GDP,Economic Output,Major News,US Government News,Inflation,Economic Indicators,Labour / Personnel,Economic News (3rd Party),Interest Rates / Policy,Economic Events,United States","sector":"Markets","content":"WASHINGTON, June 29 (Reuters) - The U.S. economy slowed less sharply in the first quarter than initially estimated due to unexpectedly higher consumer spending and a bigger jump in exports. Gross domestic product increased at a 1.4 percent annual rate instead of the 1.2 percent pace reported last month, the Commerce Department said in its final assessment on Thursday. It was still the slowest growth rate since the second quarter of last year. Economists polled by Reuters had expected GDP growth to remain unchanged at a 1.2 percent rate. GDP for the January-March period tends to underperform relative to the rest of the year due to perennial issues with the calculation of the data the government has said it is working to resolve. First-quarter economic growth was boosted by an upward revision to consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. Consumer spending rose at a 1.1 percent rate instead of the previously reported 0.6 percent pace. It was still the slowest pace since the second quarter of 2013. Despite the upward revision, the Trump administration's stated target of swiftly boosting U.S. growth to 3 percent remains a challenge. A sustained average of 3 percent growth has not been seen since the 1990s. Since 2000, the U.S. economy has grown at an average 2 percent rate. The U.S. economy expanded 1.6 percent in 2016, the lowest rate in five years. President Donald Trump's economic program of tax cuts, regulatory rollbacks and infrastructure spending has yet to get off the ground five months into his presidency. Initial signs that economic growth re-accelerated sharply in the second quarter have also faltered with recent disappointing data on retail sales, manufacturing production and inflation. Housing data has also been mixed. The Atlanta Federal Reserve currently forecasts annualized GDP growth of 2.9 percent in the second quarter. Exports in the first quarter were revised to show a gain of 7.0 percent from the previously reported 5.8 percent. Business spending on equipment was revised to show it increasing at a 7.8 percent rate in the January-March period rather than the 7.2 percent previously estimated. Businesses accumulated inventories at a rate of $2.6 billion in the first quarter, rather than the $4.3 billion reported last month. Inventory investment rose at a $49.6 billion rate in the fourth quarter of last year. Inventories subtracted 1.11 percentage point from GDP growth instead of the 1.07 percentage point previously reported. The government also reported that corporate profits after tax with inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustments fell at an annual rate of 2.7 percent in the first quarter after rising at a 2.3 percent pace in the prior three months.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-economy-gdp-idUSKBN19K1NV"},

The directive defined close family as a parent, spouse, child, adult son or daughter, son-in-law, daughter-in-law or sibling, including step-siblings and other step-family relations, according to a cable distributed to all U.S. diplomatic posts on Wednesday and seen by Reuters. Close family  does not include grandparents, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, cousins, brothers-in-law and sisters-in-law, fiancés, and any other 'extended' family members,  according to the cable, first reported by the Associated Press. Immigration experts noted that fiancés, grandparents and grandchildren did not qualify as a close family relationship.  It also specified that the relationship with a U.S. entity  must be formal, documented, and formed in the ordinary course, rather than for the purpose of evading the E.O.,  referring to the executive order signed by U.S. President Donald Trump on March 6 that barred most U.S. travel by citizens of the six nations for 90 days. The cable advises U.S. consular officers on how to interpret Monday's Supreme Court ruling that allowed parts of the executive order, which had been blocked by the lower courts, to be implemented while the highest U.S. court considers the matter. The six nations included in the executive order are Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen. The travel ban will go into effect at 8 p.m. EDT on Thursday, the cable said. (Read the cable at: here) Asked about the guidance issued on Wednesday night, the State Department declined to comment on internal communications. The cable's language closely mirrored the Supreme Court's order on the travel ban, but appeared to be a narrow interpretation in some areas, notably in defining close family. It was unclear on Wednesday evening whether the State Department's interpretation of the court's order would spark further legal action by opponents of the ban. Several immigration lawyers expressed surprise on Wednesday evening that fiancés, grandparents and grandchildren were not covered.  This language is extremely disappointing,  said Johnathan Smith, legal director at Muslim Advocates, a civil rights group.  Defining close family to exclude grandparents, cousins, and other relatives defies common sense and directly goes against the intent of the Supreme Court's order.  The directive gave several examples of what might constitute a bona fide relationship with a U.S. entity, and said broad categories would be exempt from the travel ban, such as people eligible for student visas,  as their bona fide relationship to a person or entity is inherent in the visa classification.  Similarly, those eligible for family or employment-based immigrant visa applications are exempt from the travel ban, the cable said.  A worker who accepted an offer of employment from a company in the United States or a lecturer invited to address an audience in the United States would be exempt  from the ban, the order said, but someone who simply made a hotel reservation would not be considered as having a bona fide relationship. Trump's executive order also imposed a 120-day ban on entry to the United States by refugees. The Supreme Court order, however, said the ban did not cover those refugees  who can credibly claim a bona fide relationship with a person or entity  in the United States. The State Department guidance was unclear on what U.S. refugee agencies regard as a key question: whether their own dealings with refugees applying to come to the United States constituted a bona fide relationship. Consulates should continue to interview applicants for so-called diversity visas, which are granted to individuals from countries that typically do not send many people to the United States, according to the cable. In 2015, around 10,500 citizens from the six banned countries were selected for the diversity visa lottery, according to State Department figures. The travel ban will likely bar such visas for citizens of the six countries, the cable acknowledged, stating that  we anticipate that very few DV applicants are likely to be exempt from the E.O.’s suspension of entry or to qualify for a waiver.

The surprisingly strong inflation figures released on Thursday come only days after ECB head Mario Draghi suggested the central bank's asset-purchase programme would become less accommodative going into 2018 after regional growth has gained pace and inflation trends returned following a period of falling prices. German consumer prices, harmonised to compare with other European countries, rose by 1.5 percent on the year after an increase of 1.4 percent in the previous month, the Federal Statistics Office said. On the month, prices rose 0.2 percent. Both figures came in stronger than expected, with a Reuters poll having pointed to an increase of 1.3 percent on the year and an unchanged reading on the month. In Spain, EU-harmonised consumer prices rose by 1.6 percent year-on-year in June, flash data from the National Statistics Institute (INE) showed. This compared with a Reuters poll of 1.5 percent and previous reading of 2.0 percent. A breakdown of the German non-harmonised data showed energy costs were unchanged in June while food and services inflation clearly picked up, suggesting that Germany's economic upswing is slowly pushing up underlying price pressures.  The domestic economy is buzzing. It is quite possible that this will soon be reflected in rising wages and salaries,  KfW Bank economist Joerg Zeuner said.  This is likely to boost the economy and inflation. It would open up new opportunities for the ECB to normalise its monetary policy,  Zeuner added. With its 2.3-trillion-euro asset buys running until the end of the year, the ECB will have to decide in the third quarter whether to extend or wind down the purchases, reconciling an apparent contradiction between healthy growth and still modest inflation. The euro zone will publish preliminary inflation data on Friday, with the annual rate expected to be 1.2 percent according to Reuters polls. Inflation has undershot the ECB's target of almost 2 percent for more than four years but Draghi has hinted at a willingness to look through some of the factors holding down price growth, mainly energy prices.

The officials, who included conservative National Action Party (PAN) head Ricardo Anaya, received text messages linked to software known as Pegasus, which Israeli company NSO Group only sells to governments, the report by Citizen Lab said. Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto has asked the attorney general's office to investigate charges that the government spied on private citizens, saying he wanted to get to the bottom of the accusations that he called  false.  Last week, Citizen Lab, a group of researchers at the University of Toronto's Munk School, identified 12 activists, human-rights lawyers and journalists who had also seen attempts to infect their phones with the powerful spyware. John Scott-Railton, one of a group of researchers at Citizen Lab who have spent five years tracking the use of such spyware by governments against civilians, said Mexico's case was notable for the number of targets and the intensity of efforts.  What we have already provided, in our prior reporting, is strong circumstantial evidence implicating the government of Mexico,  he said. Anaya, PAN Senator Roberto Gil Zuarth and Fernando Rodriguez, the PAN's communications secretary, received infectious messages in June 2016, when lawmakers were discussing anti-corruption legislation, the report said. The PAN officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Pena Nieto's office said in a statement that it  categorically refuses to allow any of its agencies to carry out surveillance or intervention of communications  except for fighting organized crime or national security threats, and only with court authorization. Mexico's government purchased about $80 million worth of spyware from NSO Group, according to a report by the New York Times last week. The spying allegations have added to the problems facing Pena Nieto, whose popularity has waned due to rising violence and signs of widespread corruption. Among the previous targets who Citizen Lab identified were Carmen Aristegui, a journalist who in 2014 helped reveal that Pena Nieto's wife had acquired a house from a major government contractor, as well as lawyers representing the families of 43 students who disappeared and were apparently massacred in 2014. At least nine of the people who were targeted filed charges with authorities on June 19. On June 22, Pena Nieto promised a thorough investigation and insisted that Mexico was a democracy that tolerated critical voices. The president's office said in its latest statement that any new allegations would be added to the current investigation.

Hundreds of people in Nigeria's middle belt region are killed each year in clashes, mainly over land use, between semi-nomadic, cattle-herding Fulani and settled farming communities. The violence has surged in recent years as advancing desertification, overgrazing and lower rainfall drive the mainly Muslim pastoralists toward more fertile land in Nigeria's predominantly Christian south, analysts and activists say. But a project to train local leaders in conflict resolution, as well as establish joint projects, has settled more than 500 disputes - over issues from grazing rights to water access - in about 50 communities since 2013, aid agency Mercy Corps said.  Having the opportunity to work towards a common goal has helped to improve their relationship, and resolve disputes peacefully,  said Mercy Corps peacebuilding adviser Lisa Inks.  By tackling the drivers of conflict, mainly competition for scarce resources, these herders and farmers will be more likely to sustain peace,  Inks told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Mercy Corps' four-year project, funded by Britain's Department for International Development (DFID), saw communities report fewer tensions, less disruption to their livelihoods and greater trust compared with those outside of the scheme. While relations between herders and farmers who were not involved deteriorated over the four years, those inside the project felt it was safer to work and travel without fear of violence, according to the aid agency. The project has also brought together farmers and herders to keep bees and produce honey, grow cassava and rice, and build joint markets where they can trade with each other, Inks said.     Violence between farmers and herdsmen in four states may have cost the country $14 billion or more a year in lost  revenues, according to Mercy Corps.  Conflict in the middle belt has devastated local communities and hampered economic growth for decades,  said Iveta Ouvry, Nigeria country director for Mercy Corps.  These successes demonstrate that we must continue investing in local dispute resolution to address the root causes of this conflict.  Aid agencies fear the herder-farmer conflict may be overlooked as the country grapples with a Boko Haram insurgency in the northeast and its first recession in 25 years, largely due to low oil prices.

Hundreds of people in Nigeria's middle belt region are killed each year in clashes, mainly over land use, between semi-nomadic, cattle-herding Fulani and settled farming communities. The violence has surged in recent years as advancing desertification, overgrazing and lower rainfall drive the mainly Muslim pastoralists toward more fertile land in Nigeria's predominantly Christian south, analysts and activists say. But a project to train local leaders in conflict resolution, as well as establish joint projects, has settled more than 500 disputes - over issues from grazing rights to water access - in about 50 communities since 2013, aid agency Mercy Corps said.  Having the opportunity to work towards a common goal has helped to improve their relationship, and resolve disputes peacefully,  said Mercy Corps peacebuilding adviser Lisa Inks.  By tackling the drivers of conflict, mainly competition for scarce resources, these herders and farmers will be more likely to sustain peace,  Inks told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Mercy Corps' four-year project, funded by Britain's Department for International Development (DFID), saw communities report fewer tensions, less disruption to their livelihoods and greater trust compared with those outside of the scheme. While relations between herders and farmers who were not involved deteriorated over the four years, those inside the project felt it was safer to work and travel without fear of violence, according to the aid agency. The project has also brought together farmers and herders to keep bees and produce honey, grow cassava and rice, and build joint markets where they can trade with each other, Inks said.     Violence between farmers and herdsmen in four states may have cost the country $14 billion or more a year in lost  revenues, according to Mercy Corps.  Conflict in the middle belt has devastated local communities and hampered economic growth for decades,  said Iveta Ouvry, Nigeria country director for Mercy Corps.  These successes demonstrate that we must continue investing in local dispute resolution to address the root causes of this conflict.  Aid agencies fear the herder-farmer conflict may be overlooked as the country grapples with a Boko Haram insurgency in the northeast and its first recession in 25 years, largely due to low oil prices.

The survey of equity strategists highlights the reversal of fortunes this year for Latin American assets. Mexican stocks already recovered all the value initially lost when U.S. President Donald Trump was elected in November. Meanwhile Brazilian equities, which gained over 40 percent since early 2016, have slipped in recent weeks as a political scandal threatens to remove President Michel Temer from office. The latest poll consensus taken June 20-28 showed Mexico's benchmark S&P;/BMV IPC index rising over 6 percent from Wednesday's close to a record high of 52,500 by the end of 2017, up from a forecast of 48,875 in a March poll. The IPC index is forecast to advance even further in 2018, climbing to 53,650 despite uncertainty over a presidential election in which leftist candidate Andrés Manuel López Obrador appears as potential winner. Analysts see lower chances for record-setting gains in Brazilian stock markets. Forecasts for the benchmark Bovespa index were down to 64,662 for the end of 2017, from 74,000 in March's poll, according to the poll. The impressive rally in Brazilian equities had been fueled by hopes that Temer's austerity agenda would help the economy emerge from its worst recession on record. Temer now faces a Supreme Court investigation, and the measures he proposed, including labor reform and an overhaul of the country's social security system, risk being shelved by Congress.  It's been hard to forecast even the day (after) tomorrow,  said Vitor Suzaki, an analyst with São Paulo-based brokerage Lerosa. Corruption investigations against Temer and other sitting politicians and the general elections of 2018 were cited by analysts among the main risks ahead. In Mexico, strategists were watching for the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with the U.S. -- the destination of more than 80 percent of Mexican exports. Trump took power vowing a tougher line on trade to protect U.S. industry and jobs, but has refrained from simply terminating the trade pact. Formal talks between the United States, Canada and Mexico to start renegotiating the accord that took effect in 1994 are expected to begin around August.  Mexico's Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo last month said there were  incentives  to wrap up the talks this year.  Potential negative outcomes for NAFTA renegotiation could impact the equity market. However, this is not our base case scenario,  Credit Suisse strategist Andrew Campbell said in a written response to the poll.

The directive defined close family as a parent, spouse, child, adult son or daughter, son-in-law, daughter-in-law or sibling, including step-siblings and other step-family relations, according to a cable distributed to all U.S. diplomatic posts on Wednesday and seen by Reuters. Close family  does not include grandparents, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, cousins, brothers-in-law and sisters-in-law, fiancés, and any other 'extended' family members,  according to the cable, first reported by the Associated Press. Immigration experts noted that fiancés, grandparents and grandchildren did not qualify as a close family relationship.  It also specified that the relationship with a U.S. entity  must be formal, documented, and formed in the ordinary course, rather than for the purpose of evading the E.O.,  referring to the executive order signed by U.S. President Donald Trump on March 6 that barred most U.S. travel by citizens of the six nations for 90 days. The cable advises U.S. consular officers on how to interpret Monday's Supreme Court ruling that allowed parts of the executive order, which had been blocked by the lower courts, to be implemented while the highest U.S. court considers the matter. The six nations included in the executive order are Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen. The travel ban will go into effect at 8 p.m. EDT on Thursday, the cable said. (Read the cable at: here) Asked about the guidance issued on Wednesday night, the State Department declined to comment on internal communications. The cable's language closely mirrored the Supreme Court's order on the travel ban, but appeared to be a narrow interpretation in some areas, notably in defining close family. It was unclear on Wednesday evening whether the State Department's interpretation of the court's order would spark further legal action by opponents of the ban. Several immigration lawyers expressed surprise on Wednesday evening that fiancés, grandparents and grandchildren were not covered.  This language is extremely disappointing,  said Johnathan Smith, legal director at Muslim Advocates, a civil rights group.  Defining close family to exclude grandparents, cousins, and other relatives defies common sense and directly goes against the intent of the Supreme Court's order.  The directive gave several examples of what might constitute a bona fide relationship with a U.S. entity, and said broad categories would be exempt from the travel ban, such as people eligible for student visas,  as their bona fide relationship to a person or entity is inherent in the visa classification.  Similarly, those eligible for family or employment-based immigrant visa applications are exempt from the travel ban, the cable said.  A worker who accepted an offer of employment from a company in the United States or a lecturer invited to address an audience in the United States would be exempt  from the ban, the order said, but someone who simply made a hotel reservation would not be considered as having a bona fide relationship. Trump's executive order also imposed a 120-day ban on entry to the United States by refugees. The Supreme Court order, however, said the ban did not cover those refugees  who can credibly claim a bona fide relationship with a person or entity  in the United States. The State Department guidance was unclear on what U.S. refugee agencies regard as a key question: whether their own dealings with refugees applying to come to the United States constituted a bona fide relationship. Consulates should continue to interview applicants for so-called diversity visas, which are granted to individuals from countries that typically do not send many people to the United States, according to the cable. In 2015, around 10,500 citizens from the six banned countries were selected for the diversity visa lottery, according to State Department figures. The travel ban will likely bar such visas for citizens of the six countries, the cable acknowledged, stating that  we anticipate that very few DV applicants are likely to be exempt from the E.O.’s suspension of entry or to qualify for a waiver.

The measures, announced on Wednesday by the Department of Homeland Security and applicable to all commercial flights to the United States, include increased explosive trace detection efforts and more screening of passengers.  It's difficult to estimate, at this point, how much the new measures will cost, but it is likely to be significant,  a spokesman for ACI Europe told Reuters.  Unless national governments assist with funding them, then the cost will ultimately fall on airports, airlines and air travellers,  he said, adding there was no time to lose to implement the measures. Airlines and airports across Europe said it was too early to give details of any operational impact or costs. Airlines such as Lufthansa and Norwegian Air Shuttle said they would work with authorities to implement the measures. As an example of the costs for airports, when new European Union rules on explosive trace detection on passengers and hand luggage came into force in 2015, Brussels Airport said it had invested 1.5 million euros into equipment for the checks. The airports with the most U.S.–bound flights in Europe are London Heathrow, Paris Charles de Gaulle, Frankfurt, Amsterdam Schiphol and Dublin. A spokeswoman for Schiphol airport, which has already seen long security queues this summer, said moving U.S. flights to another part of Schiphol could be an option, but it was unclear at the moment whether that would be necessary. Heathrow Airport said it would provide updated advice to passengers  in due course . There was also relief that the new measures would avoid an extension of the ban on passengers bringing large electronic devices such as laptops and tablets into cabins, which many had predicted would have resulted in widespread disruption at airports and led to increased fire risks from storing such devices in the hold.  We are satisfied that, at this stage, the U.S. has ... instead decided in favour of more targeted measures to address identified risks, without compromising safety,  ACI Europe said.

Consumers -- the drivers of the country's economic growth -- are under pressure from a rise in inflation after last year's vote to leave the European Union caused sterling to plunge. But the BoE expects the slowdown to be gentle enough that business investment and exports should fill most of the gap. If that proves right, most of the BoE's rate-setters might swing behind the first British rate rise in a decade, following the lead of the U.S. Federal Reserve. There have also signs of a shift by central bankers in the euro zone and Japan away from the emergency support that have held up their economies since the global financial crisis. The BoE said on Thursday that consumer lending grew at an annualised rate of 10.2 percent in the three months to May -- its joint-fastest rate since hitting an 11-year high in November. The net increase of 1.7 billion pounds ($2.2 billion) in May was the biggest in six months and beat all forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists. So too did the number of mortgages approved and net mortgage lending. By contrast, other recent measures have suggested consumers are subdued. Retail sales suffered their biggest drop since 2010 in the first three months of 2017. On Thursday, supermarket chain Asda said household spending power saw its biggest squeeze since 2013 in May. It also remains to be seen how Prime Minister Theresa May's failure to win a majority in June 8's parliament election affects attitudes about spending. A European Commission survey showed consumer morale in June was its weakest since the Brexit vote as households digested the implications of the inconclusive election. Ruth Gregory of Capital Economics said the rise in borrowing growth  was something of a double-edged sword  for the BoE which is trying to assess what damage a rate hike might cause for households and their spending.  May's household borrowing figures provide another reason to think that consumer spending growth may have picked up pace ... but will clearly add to concerns about household debt.  Change of Tone by Carney? BoE Governor Mark Carney said this week that consumer borrowing was rising far faster than incomes and the BoE would bring forward its annual check on lenders who have loosened their credit standards. The BoE says raising interest rates from a record low 0.25 percent is its last line of defence to check risky lending. Instead, any rate hike decision will be driven by the outlook for inflation which hit its highest in nearly four years at 2.9 percent in May, above the BoE's target of 2 percent. For three of the BoE's eight rate-setters, there were enough warning signs that the rise of inflation could stick to justify an immediate rate rise when they met this month. BoE Chief Economist Haldane then surprised financial markets last week by saying he expected back a rate rise this year too, if growth matched the BoE's forecasts. Haldane said on Thursday the central bank needed to  look seriously  at raising rates. Carney had seemed more sceptical but on Wednesday he did not repeat previous comments that now was not the time for a hike. Investors took his comments as a signal that a rate rise was looming and they pushed yields on two-year British government debt to the highest since before the Brexit vote. Many economists urged caution. They have been wrong-footed in the past over BoE rates signals.  (There are) too many mixed messages from the (Monetary Policy Committee) at the moment,  Alpesh Paleja, an economist at the Confederation of British Industry, said on Twitter.  (I'm) not convinced Carney has turned hawkish.  While business surveys point to stronger exports and business investment, this has not yet shown up in official data. Furthermore, wage growth - which some BoE policymakers see as the key driver of medium-term inflation - remains weak.

Britain returned Hong Kong to Chinese rule on July 1, 1997, under a  one country, two systems  formula which guarantees wide-ranging freedoms and judicial independence unseen in mainland China.  Beijing has promised Hong Kong's capitalist system will remain unchanged for  at least  50 years until 2047, but it has not clarified what happens after that.  Hong Kong has always tugged at my heartstrings,  Xi said on arrival at Hong Kong airport for the handover anniversary in front of flag-waving crowds at the start of a three-day visit.  ... We are willing, together with different sectors of Hong Kong society, to look back on Hong Kong's unusual course in the past 20 years, draw conclusions from the experience, look into the future and to ensure 'one country, two systems' is stable and has a far-reaching future.  Xi's message was consistent with those of other senior Chinese leaders visiting Hong Kong, that Beijing will safeguard the city's development and prosperity. In reality, however, fears of the creeping influence of Communist Party leaders in Beijing have been starkly exposed in recent years by the abduction by mainland agents of some Hong Kong booksellers who specialized in politically sensitive material and Beijing's efforts in disqualifying two pro-independence lawmakers elected to the city legislature. Xi did not respond to journalists, including one who asked whether Liu Xiaobo, China's Nobel Peace Laureate and jailed dissident, would be released and allowed to travel overseas to be treated for cancer. Speaking later, Xi praised Hong Kong's outgoing leader, Leung Chun-ying, who cracked down hard on pro-democracy Occupy protests in 2014, for his substantial contributions to the country,  especially safeguarding national security .  These past five years have not been easy at all,  Xi added. He urged officials to support incoming leader Carrie Lam, who will be sworn in on Saturday, and contribute to the  China  dream .    An annual July 1 protest pressing social causes, including a call for full democracy, is expected to take place after Xi leaves on Saturday. On Wednesday night, police arrested several well-known pro-democracy activists, some of whom scrambled up a monument symbolizing the city's handover from British to Chinese rule. Among them was student leader Joshua Wong, who said on his Facebook page on Thursday his detention for more than 16 hours was highly unusual and police had yet to take his statement.

This promise has been shattered under the watchful eyes of the whole world,  organizers of Saturday's planned rally wrote in a statement.  Hong Kong has been lied to for 20 years. Let's retake Hong Kong for a real and fully fledged democracy.  A massive security presence is expected with thousands of police deployed to maintain order as protests simmer. Slideshow (11 Images)At least 200 protesters sat in sweltering heat outside Hong Kong's highest court on Thursday night to demand the release of dissident Liu.   Xi Jinping should release Liu Xiaobo,  said Annie Tam, who watched as her six-year-old son held a candle.  I respect Liu very much. He really is sacrificing himself for democracy.  The streets of Hong Kong have been festooned with Chinese banners and paraphernalia, including two huge harbourfront screens carrying celebratory messages. Upwards of 120,000 youngsters will join China patriotic activities at a time of growing disillusionment with Beijing among the city's younger generation.  We ... just hope our people can live in peace and contentment,  said Lee Wing-lung, 66, a retired engineer standing opposite the hotel where Xi is staying, taking snapshots with his phone.  I hope Hong Kong can have a good and peaceful atmosphere.  British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said in London  Britain hopes that Hong Kong will make more progress toward democracy.  As we look to the future, Britain hopes that Hong Kong will make more progress toward a fully democratic and accountable system of government,  Johnson said in a statement.  Britain’s commitment to Hong Kong – enshrined in the Joint Declaration with China – is just as strong today as it was 20 years ago.  Many observers point out that the British did nothing to promote democracy until the dying days of more than 150 years of colonial rule. Britain, looking for new trade partners as Brexit approaches, is also keen not to upset China, the world's second-largest economy. Chris Patten, Hong Kong's last governor, told the Guardian newspaper British  kowtowing  to China would become increasingly craven after Brexit.

BHP entered the shale business at the height of the fracking boom in 2011 and invested billions more developing the operations. The fall in oil prices since then has led to pre-tax writedowns of about $13 billion on the business.    Activist shareholder and hedge fund Elliott Management, holding 4.1 percent of BHP's London-listed shares, has been trying to gain support from other shareholders to persuade BHP to sell the shale oil and gas business.   If you had to turn the clock back, and if we knew what we knew today, we wouldn't do it, of course we wouldn't do it, but go back and put yourself in our position at that time,  Nasser told a business seminar, referring to the shale purchase.  We bought exactly what we thought we were buying, but the timing was way off.  New York-based Elliott has directed a barrage of criticism at the global miner since releasing a list of changes in April it wants the company to implement. Its list includes an exit from shale, removal of BHP's dual London and Australian stock listings and greater emphasis on shareholder returns.    Nasser would not comment on Elliott's proposal. But he defended BHP's performance, saying the company's shareholder returns were up 486 percent since BHP merged with Billiton Plc in 2001. BHP Chief Executive Andrew Mackenzie told a conference in May the company was considering divesting some shale acreage, although it believed the assets were  well-placed for the future.  Australian wealth management group Escala and fund Tribeca Investment Partners have also campaigned for a revamp at BHP, calling for board changes and reviews of the energy operations.    Nasser, a former head of Ford Motor Co. is scheduled to retire as chairman on Sept. 1. The appointment of Nasser's successor, Ken MacKenzie, a former packaging industry executive, has been welcomed by Elliott as a  constructive step in bringing much needed change to the direction of BHP.

Shares of the top six U.S. banks rose in premarket trading on Thursday after the Fed's decision, which allows them to raise dividend payouts and share buybacks.  The banks will be in the spotlight today as all of the U.S. banks passed the stress test setting the stage for the indices to hold on to Wednesday's gains,  said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial in New York. Wall Street rallied sharply on Wednesday, with the benchmark S&P; 500 index scoring its biggest one-day percentage gain in about two months, as financial and technology stocks led a broad market rebound. The Nasdaq posted on Wednesday its best session since Nov. 7, the day before the U.S. presidential election. Tech stocks, which have led the S&P; 500's 9-percent gain this year, pulled back recently as some investors questioned the sector's high valuations. Oil prices rose to a two-week high on Thursday, extending a rally into the sixth straight session, after a decline in weekly U.S. production eased concerns about deepening oversupply. Cardillo said end-of-the-quarter window dressing and an optimistic global outlook should make for a steady-to-positive session. The markets were little changed after data showed the U.S. economy slowed less sharply in the first quarter than initially estimated due to unexpectedly higher consumer spending and a bigger jump in exports. The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits edged up last week, but the underlying trend remained consistent with a tight labor market.

Among stocks, Staples jumped 10 percent after private equity firm Sycamore Partners agreed to acquire the U.S. office supplies chain for $6.9 billion.

Others have cancelled travel plans and scrapped import deals with UAE-based firms since the countries cut ties with Qatar on June 5 and imposed economic sanctions, accusing it of funding militants. It was not immediately clear under what jurisdictional basis the legal claims would be made and whether governments involved would have to first agree to arbitration. Ali al-Marri, chairman of QNHRC, told reporters on Wednesday that his organisation would pursue compensation claims in courts in Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain as well as in Europe. He did not elaborate.  Some cases will be filed in courts in those three countries and in some courts that have international jurisdictions, like in Europe, related to compensation,  he said. Lalive, which declined to comment, has practised in Qatar since 2006 and unlike other international law firms does not have offices in Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the UAE. The firm's partners include Michael Schneider, an expert in international commercial arbitration who represented Saddam Hussein's government in the U.N. Compensation Commission over claims related to Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.

Shares of the top six U.S. banks rose in premarket trading on Thursday after the Fed's decision, which allows them to raise dividend payouts and share buybacks.  The banks will be in the spotlight today as all of the U.S. banks passed the stress test setting the stage for the indices to hold on to Wednesday's gains,  said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial in New York. Wall Street rallied sharply on Wednesday, with the benchmark S&P; 500 index scoring its biggest one-day percentage gain in about two months, as financial and technology stocks led a broad market rebound. The Nasdaq posted on Wednesday its best session since Nov. 7, the day before the U.S. presidential election. Tech stocks, which have led the S&P; 500's 9-percent gain this year, pulled back recently as some investors questioned the sector's high valuations. Oil prices rose to a two-week high on Thursday, extending a rally into the sixth straight session, after a decline in weekly U.S. production eased concerns about deepening oversupply. Cardillo said end-of-the-quarter window dressing and an optimistic global outlook should make for a steady-to-positive session. The markets were little changed after data showed the U.S. economy slowed less sharply in the first quarter than initially estimated due to unexpectedly higher consumer spending and a bigger jump in exports. The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits edged up last week, but the underlying trend remained consistent with a tight labor market. Dow e-minis were up 15 points, or 0.07 percent, at 8:42 a.m. ET (1242 GMT) with 26,089 contracts changing hands. S&P; 500 e-minis were up 1.75 points, or 0.07 percent, with 169,864 contracts traded. Nasdaq 100 e-minis were down 31.5 points, or 0.55 percent, on volume of 37,198 contracts. Among stocks, Staples jumped 10 percent after private equity firm Sycamore Partners agreed to acquire the U.S. office supplies chain for $6.9 billion. Walgreens Boots Alliance was up 4 percent after it terminated agreement to buy Rite Aid Corp and said it would instead buy nearly half of Rite Aid's stores for $5.18 billion.

Britain returned Hong Kong to Chinese rule on July 1, 1997, under a  one country, two systems  formula which guarantees wide-ranging freedoms and judicial independence unseen in mainland China.  Beijing has promised Hong Kong's capitalist system will remain unchanged for  at least  50 years until 2047, but it has not clarified what happens after that.  Hong Kong has always tugged at my heartstrings,  Xi said on arrival at Hong Kong airport for the handover anniversary in front of flag-waving crowds at the start of a three-day visit.  ... We are willing, together with different sectors of Hong Kong society, to look back on Hong Kong's unusual course in the past 20 years, draw conclusions from the experience, look into the future and to ensure 'one country, two systems' is stable and has a far-reaching future.  Xi's message was consistent with those of other senior Chinese leaders visiting Hong Kong, that Beijing will safeguard the city's development and prosperity. In reality, however, fears of the creeping influence of Communist Party leaders in Beijing have been starkly exposed in recent years by the abduction by mainland agents of some Hong Kong booksellers who specialized in politically sensitive material and Beijing's efforts in disqualifying two pro-independence lawmakers elected to the city legislature. Xi did not respond to journalists, including one who asked whether Liu Xiaobo, China's Nobel Peace Laureate and jailed dissident, would be released and allowed to travel overseas to be treated for cancer. Speaking later, Xi praised Hong Kong's outgoing leader, Leung Chun-ying, who cracked down hard on pro-democracy Occupy protests in 2014, for his substantial contributions to the country,  especially safeguarding national security .  These past five years have not been easy at all,  Xi added. He urged officials to support incoming leader Carrie Lam, who will be sworn in on Saturday, and contribute to the  China  dream .    An annual July 1 protest pressing social causes, including a call for full democracy, is expected to take place after Xi leaves on Saturday. On Wednesday night, police arrested several well-known pro-democracy activists, some of whom scrambled up a monument symbolizing the city's handover from British to Chinese rule. Among them was student leader Joshua Wong, who said on his Facebook page on Thursday his detention for more than 16 hours was highly unusual and police had yet to take his statement.

This promise has been shattered under the watchful eyes of the whole world,  organizers of Saturday's planned rally wrote in a statement.  Hong Kong has been lied to for 20 years. Let's retake Hong Kong for a real and fully fledged democracy.  A massive security presence is expected with thousands of police deployed to maintain order as protests simmer. Slideshow (11 Images)At least 200 protesters sat in sweltering heat outside Hong Kong's highest court on Thursday night to demand the release of dissident Liu.   Xi Jinping should release Liu Xiaobo,  said Annie Tam, who watched as her six-year-old son held a candle.  I respect Liu very much. He really is sacrificing himself for democracy.  The streets of Hong Kong have been festooned with Chinese banners and paraphernalia, including two huge harbourfront screens carrying celebratory messages. Upwards of 120,000 youngsters will join China patriotic activities at a time of growing disillusionment with Beijing among the city's younger generation.  We ... just hope our people can live in peace and contentment,  said Lee Wing-lung, 66, a retired engineer standing opposite the hotel where Xi is staying, taking snapshots with his phone.  I hope Hong Kong can have a good and peaceful atmosphere.  British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said in London  Britain hopes that Hong Kong will make more progress toward democracy.  As we look to the future, Britain hopes that Hong Kong will make more progress toward a fully democratic and accountable system of government,  Johnson said in a statement.  Britain’s commitment to Hong Kong – enshrined in the Joint Declaration with China – is just as strong today as it was 20 years ago.  Many observers point out that the British did nothing to promote democracy until the dying days of more than 150 years of colonial rule. Britain, looking for new trade partners as Brexit approaches, is also keen not to upset China, the world's second-largest economy. Chris Patten, Hong Kong's last governor, told the Guardian newspaper British  kowtowing  to China would become increasingly craven after Brexit.

Called AMC Premiere, the on-demand offering also includes movies and exclusive content such as deleted scenes or interviews with series stars and producers. At first, it will be available only to subscribers of Comcast Corp's Xfinity TV packages. The move is a new example of how TV networks and distributors are trying to adapt to rapidly shifting viewer habits, particularly among young people who are flocking to on-demand and ad-free programing. Unlike standalone streaming options from Time Warner Inc’s HBO and from CBS Corp, AMC's offering will be available exclusively to pay TV customers.   It made so much sense to start where the viewers are,  Charlie Collier, president of AMC, SundanceTV and AMC Studios, said in an interview.  Reuters first reported AMC's plans for a commercial-free option in March.  Subscribers to AMC Premiere, which costs $4.99 per month, will be able to watch ad-free episodes of current network series starting as they debut on the cable channel. The programing will be watchable initially through an Xfinity set-top box or the Xfinity Stream website or app, and later on AMC's apps and its website.  AMC plans to expand the subscription option beyond Comcast to other pay TV providers, Collier said.  For Comcast, the largest U.S. pay TV operator, AMC Premiere adds to the growing stable of on-demand options the company offers to help retain customers.  I don't think it's an option necessarily for everyone, but there is certainly a segment of passionate viewers and fans that I think they could find this very appealing,  said Matt Strauss, Comcast's executive vice president and general manager of video and entertainment services.

The GST will replace about 20 federal and state taxes such as factory-gate duties, service and local taxes while unifying $2 trillion economy and 1.3 billion people into a single market.  Modi, a Hindu nationalist politician who swept to power in 2014 promising reforms to get India's lumbering economy moving, will use the occasion to make a landmark speech. Somewhat predictably, not everyone in the world's largest democracy is happy.  Even though the Congress Party first proposed the tax reform before it fell from power three years ago, it has been left  wringing its hands over whether to join the parliamentary applause for a tax that should make India a far easier place to do business. Mamata Banerjee, the firebrand leader of All India Trinamool Congress, certainly won't be clapping. The firebrand leader of the regional party governing West Bengal intends to boycott the event, saying the ill-planned launch will hurt small enterprises across the country.   A chaotic situation may arise in our vast economy,   Banerjee told reporters in Kolkata, adding millions of small businesses were not yet ready to file multiple tax returns, and it could take up to six months to smoothly implement the legislation. Labourers sit next to a banner after a protest against the implementation of the goods and services tax (GST) on textiles, in the old quarters of Delhi, India June 29, 2017.

Small businesses in particular are unhappy at the extra demands made of them to be tax compliant during the change-over. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has given businesses two months leeway to file late returns during the switch to GST.. Slideshow (6 Images)A massive media campaign has been launched by the government to create awareness, with telephone help lines opened to address public concerns.  So far, more than three-quarters of the 8.1 million firms registered with the federal and state tax departments have enrolled with the GST Network, a massive IT back-end that will process up to 5 billion invoices a month. Millions of small businesses, outside the tax net earlier, still have to join the network, and an umbrella organization pleaded for them to be given more time.    For a seamless implementation of the law, the government should relax rules against traders for procedural lapses for six to nine months,  Praveen Khandelwal, secretary general of the Confederation of All India Traders, said. About a third of association's 60 million members lack a computer to register under the new tax regime.

The study would apply lessons from the 2007-2009 financial crisis when Northern Rock collapsed because of an unsustainable business model, Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), told a conference on Thursday. It coincides with government efforts to increase competition in a sector dominated by HSBC, Lloyds, Royal Bank of Scotland and Barclays. Bailey said 16 new banks had been approved over the last five years and 38 were considering seeking authorisation.  My hope is that we can lay out a body of evidence from which conclusions can start to be drawn,  Bailey told the British Bankers' Association (BBA) conference, adding that evidence would be gathered into the first half of next year. The study will initially focus on different products and services and their profitability as fewer customers visit bank branches, preferring to use the phone or Internet instead. BBA Chief Executive Anthony Browne told the conference that apps were now the most popular way to access accounts. But he said there was a  public interest  in access to bank branches, after many have been closed as more customers bank online. Bailey said the study  should enable us to assess better the impact of changes – for instance in technology – on retail banking business models.  In a separate review to be published in coming months, the FCA has been examining so-called high-cost credit including overdrafts, after lawmakers criticised banks for charging hefty fees for people who overdraw on their accounts.  We will then be able to decide if we need to intervene further,  Bailey said. Britain has capped high interest rates on  payday  loans, where customers borrow money against their next monthly wage and usually face steep rates. Critics say the cap risks making it tougher for the most vulnerable to access credit and could drive them into the arms of unregulated  loan sharks . Bailey said this had not been the outcome so far. Some lawmakers have called for a wider use of caps, but Bailey said  capping everything  was not the right approach. Findings from a third review by the regulator, examining how banks assess customers' understanding of their products and services, are also due to be published soon. Some lawmakers have called for the banks to end what they call  free banking  for those in credit because they say it simply means other services, such as overdrafts, are charged more heavily and that often hurts the less well off more.  I do not advocate ending free-if-in-credit banking. Why?

Called AMC Premiere, the on-demand offering also includes movies and exclusive content such as deleted scenes or interviews with series stars and producers. At first, it will be available only to subscribers of Comcast Corp's Xfinity TV packages. The move is a new example of how TV networks and distributors are trying to adapt to rapidly shifting viewer habits, particularly among young people who are flocking to on-demand and ad-free programing. Unlike standalone streaming options from Time Warner Inc’s HBO and from CBS Corp, AMC's offering will be available exclusively to pay TV customers.   It made so much sense to start where the viewers are,  Charlie Collier, president of AMC, SundanceTV and AMC Studios, said in an interview.  Reuters first reported AMC's plans for a commercial-free option in March.  Subscribers to AMC Premiere, which costs $4.99 per month, will be able to watch ad-free episodes of current network series starting as they debut on the cable channel. The programing will be watchable initially through an Xfinity set-top box or the Xfinity Stream website or app, and later on AMC's apps and its website.  AMC plans to expand the subscription option beyond Comcast to other pay TV providers, Collier said.  For Comcast, the largest U.S. pay TV operator, AMC Premiere adds to the growing stable of on-demand options the company offers to help retain customers.  I don't think it's an option necessarily for everyone, but there is certainly a segment of passionate viewers and fans that I think they could find this very appealing,  said Matt Strauss, Comcast's executive vice president and general manager of video and entertainment services.

Mohamed Anwar al-Sadat, 62, an erstwhile supporter of President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, is considering running against him in next year's election when the former armed forces chief is widely expected to stand and win. Sisi came to power in 2014, a year after he led the military in ousting elected but unpopular Islamist President Mohamed Mursi. Rights groups say Sisi has since led an unprecedented crackdown on political opponents, activists and critical media.  All (critical) television channels have been shut down and so has any free voice, but as a candidate it's your right to get a chance to speak to the media,  Sadat told Reuters in an interview. Standing for the Egyptian presidency in troubled times, with severe inflation, worsening militant violence and a loss of foreign tourism, would be bold for anyone but more so for Sadat, whose uncle was assassinated in 1981 and who himself was kicked out of parliament this year for criticizing the government. Sadat doesn't even believe he would win because he says it will not be a fair election.  I know that I will lose, but I would still like to lose with honor,  he said. Sadat said he is not seeking to make enemies or even necessarily an election victory, but rather to open a channel for dialogue about the challenges besetting Egypt. He said he was waiting to see whether there would be a more level political playing field before deciding whether to run. Sisi launched the toughest clampdown on Islamists in Egypt's modern history after overthrowing Mursi. Hundreds of Egyptian soldiers and police have been killed in fighting with militants. But critics say his security campaign has also resulted in the jailing of liberal opponents and activists.  He doesn't listen to anyone,  Sadat said.   He just releases the security apparatus and they treat people unjustly, torturing and imprisoning them in the name of combating terrorism. He is just doing this to achieve his personal glory.  Mohamed Anwar al-Sadat, the nephew of late President Anwar al-Sadat, speaks during an interview with Reuters in Cairo, Egypt June 28, 2017.Mohamed Abd El GhanyThe government push to muzzle critics has surged in the past few months, Since May 24, the Sisi government has blocked more than 57 news websites. A new law also restricts charity groups in a strike at dissidents, rights groups say. Critics sense a campaign to silence all but the most state-aligned media, reversing a private media boom that flourished in the last decade of former president Hosni Mubarak's rule and which contributed to his fall in a 2011 uprising. The crackdown touched Sadat as well. He chaired parliament's human rights committee until August, when he resigned, citing the assembly's failing to address complaints of abuse. He was kicked out soon afterwards. Mohamed Anwar al-Sadat, the nephew of late President Anwar al-Sadat, speaks during an interview with Reuters in Cairo, Egypt June 28, 2017.Mohamed Abd El GhanySisi's Rule Loses Luster Still, Egyptians increasingly fume over the state of the economy after years of political upheaval, a devaluation of the Egyptian pound, tax rises and subsidy cuts introduced by Sisi's government that have increased cost of living. A decision by Sisi to transfer two Red Sea islands to Saudi Arabia touched patriotic nerves, bringing thousands into the streets last year chanting  people want the fall of the regime  - the very slogan of the 2011 uprising. Sadat, also the founder of The Reform and Development Party,  said the island transfer was a rushed decision taken without consultation and one that cost Sisi a lot of his popularity. After parliament approved the deal handing control of Tiran and Sanafir islands to Saudi Arabia, Sadat said in a statement sent out by his party that Egyptians were in an  unprecedented state of frustration  and warned that Sisi's decisions on critical issues would alienate supporters. Sadat said he would also address what he called the  military's unprecedented expansion in the economy as this was scaring off foreign and local investors. Egypt desperately seeks a return of foreign investment, a mother lode of hard currency.  For sure, there will only be losses coming out of this election campaign, material and moral..,  Sadat said.  But in the end you do your utmost to push for reform and to ring a bell about the issues that have to be fixed.

Francois-Philippe Champagne is in Cincinnati for a meeting-packed June day as part of a concerted Canadian outreach campaign ahead of talks to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement. U.S. President Donald Trump describes the 1994 pact as a disaster and has threatened to walk away from it.        Concerned that any moves to abandon NAFTA or curb trade could cost thousands of jobs, the Liberal government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau wants to remind Americans how important bilateral trade is while seeking allies to press the Canadian cause if threats emerge. Since Trump's inauguration, Canadian politicians and officials have made almost 160 trips, meeting 14 cabinet members, almost 200 lawmakers and more than 40 state governors and lieutenant governors. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2tpGUdU) Mexico, the pact's third partner, has been leading a similar campaign.  We have to hammer, hammer, hammer away at this and when we're exhausted, hammer again,  said one person involved in the Canadian effort. Champagne's message is simple:  We are your largest client.  Every day some 400,000 people and C$2.4 billion ($1.82 billion) worth of trade cross the border. Crimping that flow will hurt both nations, says Ottawa. In all of Ohio, more than 300,000 jobs depend on trade with Canada, Champagne notes. To help drive home the point, Canadian officials drill deep into the data. For example, their analysis shows that in Ohio's first congressional district, 17,269 jobs depended on Canada-U.S. trade and investment, with exports exceeding $1 billion. Champagne, who flew in late the night before, starts his day at Cincinnati's members-only Queen City Club, where he hosts a breakfast with a dozen local leaders.  Sometimes as friends and neighbors we take each other for granted,  he tells the group.  Let's make sure we don't put things in place that would disrupt supply chains.  Reuters was granted exclusive access to the meetings during Champagne's trip.  Lawyer Daniel Ujczo, who specializes in Canada-U.S. affairs, tells Champagne his clients' biggest complaint is red tape that makes it hard to transfer specialists across the border.  I don't think companies will see a NAFTA win unless we address this,  he adds. Learning the Numbers Shortly afterwards Champagne tells a business forum of around 150 people that the greater Cincinnati area sends 20 percent of its exports to Canada. Diplomats hand out leaflets underlining the closeness of trade ties. In the car heading for his next appointment, Champagne reflects on the audience and tells aides:  They don't know many of the numbers.   That feeling is only underlined at a lunch with local politicians. William Seitz, a Republican member of Ohio's House of Representatives, admits afterwards his constituents know little about free trade. Canadian Trade Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne (R) shakes hands with Cincinnati vice mayor David Mann after a meeting in Cincinnati, Ohio, U.S., June 16, 2017. Picture taken June 16, 2017.David Ljunggren Folks don't understand as well as they should that when we erect barriers to trade with foreign countries, we are increasing prices for domestic consumers,  he says. Champagne is willing to use any hook to make a connection. He  studied in Cleveland and in every meeting notes a local politician once called him  a son of Ohio . Later in the day he presents an honorary certificate to Joey Votto, the Canadian star of the Cincinnati Reds baseball team.  You're our best export,  Champagne says as cameras click. As his car speeds from the Reds stadium to another appointment in the late afternoon, he says:  It's been a great day ... We've made a small difference.  Officials track the number of trips and how many people they meet, but say ultimately what counts is whether their new-found allies will step up to defend trade with Canada. Slideshow (3 Images)When Trump announced in April he might tear up NAFTA,  you had many Republican senators calling the White House and calling Trump to say 'This is crazy',  said another person involved in the campaign.  Some of the callers had already been approached by Canada as part of the effort to contact influence-makers, that person said. The outreach effort is not intended to convey a threat, says David MacNaughton, Canada's ambassador to Washington. But he adds:  It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that at some point, if they keep doing things that harm Canadian companies, that it's going to be difficult for us to resist doing the same.   Canada initially chose to focus on 11 states, selected for their economic and political importance. These include Indiana, home of Vice President Mike Pence. The Canadians are  talking to people who talk to Pence , one official tells Champagne. A few days after the trip, Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale is in Minneapolis, Minnesota, at an exclusive reception to build awareness of bilateral ties.  When the relationship is without any great problems, people tend to go to sleep on both sides,  he tells Reuters. Attendees include Neel Kashkari, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, and Joc O'Rourke, chief executive officer of phosphate giant Mosaic Co. Asked about the Canadian message, O'Rourke says most companies want freer or fairer trade. Pressed as to whether they will stand up for Canada, he replies:  They will of course stand up for what is in their best interest.  Goodale acknowledges the outreach does not guarantee success, but adds:  our trade will do better, and our relationship will do better, the more vigorous and outgoing we are . Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland quipped last month that  if you're an American official or legislator, it's been hard to avoid a Canadian , but Goodale is not worried Canada might be wearing out its welcome.  They are so big I think it will be a long time before we have overdone it,  he says.

After decades of strong growth, H&M; has repeatedly missed sales forecasts over the past year, with earnings squeezed by heavy investment and stiff competition from budget rivals such as Primark and online firms Zalando (ZALG.DE) and Asos (ASOS.L). The world's second-biggest fashion group reported a better than forecast 10 percent rise in pretax profit for March-May but said unexpectedly low sales and higher inventories meant it had to mark down the prices of its clothes more to get them sold.  CEO Karl-Johan Persson told Reuters it was looking  tough  to reach a target given in January for 10 percent to 15 percent sales growth this year after first-half sales came in lower than H&M; had expected. H&M;'s shares have been on a downward slope since 2015 and have fallen 18 percent in 2017 alone, whereas market leader Inditex (ITX.MC), the owner of Zara, has weathered sluggish markets better and seen its shares rise.  H&M;'s shares were up 2 percent by 1220 GMT as investors weighed the upbeat quarterly profit of 7.71 billion crowns ($904 million) against an uncertain outlook. Analysts had on average forecast profit of 7.1 billion crowns.   Whilst the outcome for the quarter is better than expected, there is plenty here for the bears too,  said Morgan Stanley analysts, who have an  underweight  rating on H&M; stock. The company put the profit increase down to better cost control and the opening of more stores. Investment Payoff? H&M; has made large investments to integrate its brick-and-mortar stores better with online shopping and speed up its supply chain. Analysts complain, however, that they are still seeing little sign of the investment paying off.  Swedish clothing retail company H&M CEO Karl-Johan Persson presents the company's second quarter report during a press conference in Stockholm, Sweden June 29, 2017. Henrik Montgomery/TT News Agency/via REUTERS H&M; has been investing heavily in online capability (IT, logistics and integration) for some time now, but sales growth has yet to respond to this,  said Societe Generale analyst Anne Critchlow, who rates H&M; stock as  sell .  For the H&M; concept's young value fashion target audience, stronger investment may be required, for example through a free delivery and returns offer, in line with some of the pure online competitors,  she said. Persson told a news conference investment would remain high. The company, which does not report online sales separately, predicted annual online sales growth of least 25 percent going forward.  H&M; is showing good confidence in the outlook for online sales and profitability. It still remains to be seen though whether its investments will have a net incremental benefit or if H&M; is merely playing catch up,  said RBC analyst Richard Chamberlain who has an  outperform  rating on the stock. FILE PHOTO: The logo of Swedish fashion label H&M is seen outside a store in Vienna, Austria, October 1, 2016,Leonhard Foeger /File PhotoH&M; warned of more price markdowns in its third quarter, after inventories also rose in the second quarter. It expected sales growth measured in local currencies in June, the first month of its third quarter, of 7 percent from a year earlier. Critchlow said that implied unchanged like-for-like sales and no improvement on the rest of the year so far. To reach more shoppers and reduce its exposure to the increasingly crowded budget clothes market, H&M; is branching out into new separate brands with higher prices than its core brand. H&M; reiterated on Thursday that its biggest separate chain, COS, would have sales of 10 billion crowns this year.  Inditex this month reported an 18 percent rise in quarterly profit.

All but one of the 21 indexes polled on from Toronto to Tokyo are expected to climb by varying degrees, although concerns are building about rising interest rates and how expensive shares look after spending most of the past decade going up. Still, the latest consensus is an upgrade to forecasts made just three months ago, and also compared with December last year, just after Donald Trump was elected into the White House. At least 16 of 21 stock indexes polled on have already breached the mid-2017 predictions made in March and December. Many of those indexes are also close to passing even the end-2017 expectations. Emerging market stocks broadly are expected to outperform, although the outlook for Europe, too, is particularly bright, standing out from previous global surveys of strategists and fund managers in recent years where it tended to be a laggard.  Europe remains our favorite area in developed market equities. Economic activity is buoyant. The earnings season has been strong and the positive momentum is expected to continue,  said Monica Defend, head of global asset allocation research at Pioneer Investments. Over the past five years, all European indexes barring the German DAX have lagged the S&P; 500 index; however, expectations are for that to flip, with the European indexes now predicted to outperform Wall Street. But the poll of around 300 financial professionals around the globe was taken at the cusp of what appears to be a notable turn in sentiment in financial markets where the U.S. dollar, ascendant for the past several years, is in retreat. In recent days, economic policymakers appear to be leaning together - in word if not yet in deed - away from policies of the recent past, despite the fact inflation has made no decisive move higher and even appears to be in a lull. That was reflected in the latest Reuters poll of bond market strategists, which showed that optimism about a global inflation pickup has at best plateaued. [US/INT] But while the U.S. economy does not appear to have stirred from a roughly 2 percent growth rate, for the moment at least, companies have been performing well. U.S. stocks are expected to rise a bit more in the second half. [EPOLL/US] However, the expectation Congress will pass into law sweeping tax cuts that Trump promised on the campaign trail and which have underpinned the Wall Street rally since he won the election appears to be fading.  You can't make money in the stock market without the consensus forecast for earnings, or a big tax cut from Trump,  said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer of Hugh Johnson Advisors LLC in Albany, New York.   You have to have one of those two things.  Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco President John Williams was even more blunt on his assessment of the risks in an interview earlier this week, saying:  The stock market seems to be running pretty much on fumes.  Analysts now note that despite relatively good company performance, the most basic measure, price to earnings ratios, suggest many stock markets around the world are looking pricey compared with historic measures.  In a 'normal' period, equity analysts are seldom as optimistic as they are at present,  wrote Tim Davis, chief investment strategist at London-based consultancy Fathom.  To us, this means there must still be some optimism about President Trump's policies priced into equities, even though the dollar and breakevens have reversed their moves and are close to levels seen immediately prior to his election victory.  In emerging markets, the potential for future growth - so long as the world economy and the financial system keep on an even keel - is more clear.  Within emerging market equities, Asia remains our preferred region,  wrote William Hobbs, head of investment strategy at Barclays, in a note to clients. Asian stock market indexes expected to perform the best from now until the end of the year are those in India, China, South Korea, Japan and Australia. [EPOLL/CN] [EPOLL/AU] India's Sensex index .BSESN, up 15 percent already this year, is forecast to hit a record high by year-end. [EPOLL/IN] In Latin America, Mexican stocks are likely to reach a record high by year-end, outshining Brazilian shares as fears over rising trade barriers from the United States abate.

Republican leaders hope to agree on changes to the legislation by Friday so lawmakers can take it up after next week's Independence Day recess.. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Tuesday abandoned plans to seek passage of it this week because Republicans did not have 50 votes to pass the bill. For seven years, Republicans have led a quest to undo the 2010 law known as Obamacare, Democratic former President Barack Obama's signature legislative achievement. Trump made dismantling it a top campaign promise during last year's presidential campaign but policy differences within the party have raised doubts Republicans can achieve a repeal. Democrats have unified against the bill and Republicans control the Senate by a slim 52-48 margin, which means McConnell can afford to lose only two Republicans. So far at least 10  - including moderates and hard-line conservatives - have expressed opposition to the current bill, although some indicated they would vote for it with certain changes. McConnell, with his reputation as a strategist on the line, met with a procession of Republican senators in his office on Wednesday. John Cornyn, the No. 2 Senate Republican, said party leaders will talk to every Republican senator who has concerns about the bill or is undecided. The House of Representatives passed its healthcare bill last month, only after striking a balance between the center of the party and the right wing. Now McConnell must find a similar sweet spot. During a lunch meeting on Wednesday Republicans made presentations on potential fixes. Senator Rand Paul called for jettisoning more parts of Obamacare to get conservatives on board. Related CoverageStates' Medicaid spending to increase under Senate bill: reportDespite healthcare setback, Trump says big surprise on bill could comeTax Issue Senator Mike Rounds suggested keeping a 3.8 percent Obamacare tax on high earners' investment income, which the current bill would eliminate. Rounds said the tax could pay for more Americans to receive the tax credits that help pay for health insurance. Senator Bob Corker, who also supports keeping the tax, said one of the issues he was focused on was helping lower-income Americans pay for health plans.  My sense is there's a good chance that issue and other issues people are trying to get addressed can be addressed,  Corker told reporters. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell speaks to the media about plans to repeal and replace Obamacare on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., June 27, 2017.Aaron P. BernsteinTrump said the bill was moving along well and predicted a  great, great surprise  but did not elaborate. Maine Senator Susan Collins, a moderate, said it would be  very difficult  to reach agreement by Friday. Collins and other centrists were put off by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office's projection on Monday that 22 million people would lose medical insurance under the existing bill. Finishing the legislation's revisions by Friday would be  optimal,  Cornyn said, so the CBO can analyze the new version.. Slideshow (5 Images)Even then, Democrats could mount a forceful resistance. They have repeatedly said they will not discuss a repeal but have expressed openness to negotiating improvements. The Senate's top Democrat, Chuck Schumer, proposed Trump call all 100 senators to Blair House across the street from the White House to craft a bipartisan bill fixing Obamacare but Trump said did not think Schumer's offer was serious. McConnell said Democrats had refused  to work with us in a serious way to comprehensively address Obamacare's failures in the seven years since they passed it.  The legislation has triggered protests at the Capitol and police said they arrested 40 people, including cancer survivors, on Wednesday for blocking Senate offices. Obama's 2010 Affordable Care Act, which passed without Republican support, expanded health insurance coverage to some 20 million people but Republicans call it a costly government intrusion. The Senate bill rolls back Obamacare's expansion of the Medicaid government insurance for the poor and cuts planned Medicaid spending starting in 2025. It also repeals most of Obamacare's taxes, ends a penalty for not obtaining insurance and overhauls subsidies that help people buy insurance with tax credits.

Heavily-indebted Mozambique released on Saturday a forensic audit report into loans made to tuna fishing company EMATUM, security firm Proindicus and Mozambique Asset Management (MAM). Reacting to the report, the Global Group of Mozambique Bondholders (GGBM) said in an emailed statement it was  evident that there is no basis -- in either Mozambican or English law -- for the Mozambique government to honor the purported guarantees of the Proindicus and MAM loans.   Disavowal of those purported guarantees and the liquidation of Proindicus, MAM, and Ematum is the appropriate restructuring that needs to take place to clean up the system,  the statement said, adding this would help to insulate the government balance sheet from further liabilities and help restore access to external financing for Mozambique. The group - made up of holders of the 2023 bond - added it expected the government's payment capacity to improve by about $850 million in the next five years thanks to an improving exchange rate and higher tax receipts.

The study by Britain's University of Southampton said no  research investment could be found in Chad, Congo and Central African Republic, where malaria deaths are some of the highest in the region, or in Sierra Leone and Mauritania. All countries received non-research funding which is designed to control malaria by investing in bed nets, public health schemes, and anti-malarial drugs. Michael Head, who led the study, said this was the first study to examine the geography of public and philanthropic research funding for malaria.  We've shown that there are countries that are being neglected ... and we need to alter the capacity for research in underfunded countries,  Head told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. The world has made huge strides against malaria since 2000, with death rates plunging by 60 percent and at least six million lives saved globally, the World Health Organization (WHO) says. But efforts to end one of the world's deadliest diseases - which kills about 430,000 people a year, mostly children in sub-Saharan Africa - are under threat as mosquitoes become increasingly resistant to measures such as bed nets and drugs. The British university study was based on an analysis of funding data from 1997 to 2013 from 13 major public and philanthropic global health funders. It found the countries that received the most research funding were Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, Malawi and Ghana. Two funders provided almost 60 percent of this funding. These were the U.S. National Institutes of Health and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Nigeria, Tanzania, Kenya, Ethiopia and Malawi received the most non-research funding. ALMA, a coalition of African heads of state and governments, aims to achieve a malaria-free Africa by 2030. Head said the disparity can be partly explained by the fact some countries in sub-Saharan Africa do not have an established research infrastructure so it was hard to invest there.  Ultimately, however, there are neglected populations in these countries who suffer greatly from malaria and other diseases,  Head said.  Investments in health improve the wealth of a nation and we need to be smarter with allocating limited resources to best help to reduce clear health inequalities.

The S&P; 500 is trading at about 18 times expected earnings over the next year, close to its priciest in over a decade. But analysts forecast S&P; 500 profit growth of 11.3 percent this year, and some say valuations have already peaked.  The broad context of corporate America right now is certainly healthy from (an) earnings perspective and will be critically important  if it is to continue to support the market rally, said Bill Northey, chief investment officer at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Helena, Montana. Correction on the Cards? Several poll participants see a correction of at least 10 percent this year as likely, citing also as risks the possibility of an overly aggressive Federal Reserve, further declines in oil prices and less earnings growth than expected. The S&P; 500 has not had a 10 percent correction since the beginning of 2016. The benchmark index is already up about 9 percent in 2017 and has gained about 14 percent since Trump's Nov. 8 election.  Optimism that Trump will be able to push through tax reform and other pro-business items on his agenda has helped fuel the rally. Yet on Tuesday the International Monetary Fund cut its growth forecasts for the U.S. economy to 2.1 percent for both 2017 and 2018, dropping its assumption Trump's tax cut and fiscal spending plans would boost growth. Investors have also raised questions over Trump's domestic policy agenda, and stocks fell Tuesday after U.S. Senate Republicans put off a planned vote on a bill to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, part of Trump's agenda. Delays will make it harder for the administration to move on to tax reform or infrastructure spending.   You can't make money in the stock market without the consensus forecast for earnings, or a big tax cut from Trump,  said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer of Hugh Johnson Advisors LLC in Albany, New York.  You have to have one of those two things.  A more hawkish Fed without a pickup in economic growth is another worry for investors.  The Fed earlier this month raised interest rates for the second time in three months. It is expected to hike rates one more time by the end of 2017, a separate Reuters poll showed. The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI will end 2017 at 21,998, showing gains, about 2.5 percent above Wednesday's close, the stocks poll showed.

Kenya The Kenyan shilling is forecast to weaken due to retail merchants and oil importers buying dollars amid weak supply from foreign investors buying government securities, traders said. Commercial banks quoted the shilling at 103.75/85 per dollar, compared with 103.75/55 at last Thursday's close.  Dollar supply side has become weaker...jittery demand from importers buying dollars to meet short-term liquidity needs,  a trader from a commercial bank said. Zambia The kwacha is expected to remain steady with a bias to appreciating slightly towards the end of next week as companies convert hard currency to the local unit to pay taxes. Commercial banks quoted the currency of Africa's No.2 copper producer at 9.1500 per dollar from a close of 9.2500 a week ago.  The performance will be more or less what it is now but we could see a bit of appreciation because of tax payments due on Thursday next week,  independent financial analyst Maambo Hamaundu said. Nigeria The Nigerian naira is seen depreciating marginally on the black market in the days ahead on an expected increase in dollar demand by small businesses and people planning for summer holidays. The local currency was quoted at 370 to the dollar on the black market on Thursday, compared with 365 a dollar it traded at last week, while commercial lenders are yet to put up a quote on the interbank market.  We are expecting a slight depreciation in the value of the naira as we approach the summer holiday period for many Nigerians unless the central bank increases dollar supply to the market to cater for the likely surge in demand,  one currency trader said. Ghana Ghana's cedi is seen firming next week on the central bank's dollar sales, helped by forex inflows from offshore investors motivated by improving macroeconomic variables, analysts said. The local unit was trading at 4.3909 per dollar by mid-morning on Thursday, compared with 4.4200 a week ago.  Improving macroeconomic variables and active central bank support are expected to support the cedi in the week ahead as investors' appetite in the economy grow stronger,  Joseph Biggles Amponsah, an analyst at Accra-based Dortis Research, said.

Two of the sources said Anirudh Singh, 33, expected to raise at least $200 million for the fund, while one source put the potential launch capital at more than $100 million. Singh worked for Eton Park for roughly six years after a stint at Goldman Sachs, documents filed with Britain's Financial Conduct Authority show. He is not deregistered from the firm. Singh did not respond to requests for comment. His move would be the first spin-out from Eton Park's London office since its assets halved from a peak of $14 billion in 2011. After a tough few years for most hedge funds in which several high profile firms have closed, several high-profile traders have branched out on their own, including the former chief investment officer at Perry Capital, David Russekoff. The number of new hedge funds hit 189 in the first quarter of 2017, an increase for the first time since the first three months of 2016, according to data from industry tracker Preqin. It was not clear whether Singh plans to work with former Eton Park colleagues at the new fund, neither was it clear where he would get financial backing. A spokesman for Eton Park declined to comment. Mindich became a partner at Goldman Sachs at 27 in 1994, making him the youngest person to do so in the firm's history.

The oil producer said last month it would sell natural gas-heavy assets in San Juan basin to privately held Hilcorp Energy Co for about $3 billion and earlier agreed to sell oil sands and western Canadian natural gas assets to Cenovus Energy Inc (CVE.TO) for C$17.7 billion.

The central bank sent an invitation to reporters this week to say the much-anticipated announcement would take place on Thursday at a news conference with the central bank governor and finance minister. But the central bank in a brief note to reporters said it had been delayed. A finance ministry official did not respond to multiple requests about why the announcement had been pushed back, and central bank officials declined to give a reason. The announcement had been delayed  a few days,  the central bank said in an email to journalists without giving any further details. The unexplained delay may reinforce investor concerns about transparency in the currency liberalisation process after several conflicting statements about the start date in the past few months.  The process is out of control and the guys in Rabat are behaving like in panic mode,  said one trader in Casablanca, where Morocco's stock exchange operates.  The mismanagement of a sensitive process is putting the confidence of stakeholders at risk.  The central bank late last year said the first stages of a gradual move from currency controls to a flexible exchange rate would be implemented in the second half of 2017, along with other reforms like inflation targeting. The dirham is fixed via a peg that is 60 percent weighted to the euro and 40 percent to the dollar. The first stage will ease that peg to allow the currency to trade in a narrow range, which will expand gradually over the course of up to 15 years. One concern has been the level of Morocco's foreign reserves. The finance minister blamed speculation ahead of the currency announcement this week for a $4.4 billion drop in reserves in the last two months.

Caisse de depot et placement du Quebec's Chief Executive Michael Sabia said in an interview with Reuters on Wednesday that the U.S. aerospace company, headquartered in Chicago, was itself a recipient of state aid.  I guess the guys at Boeing are so used to being subsidized by the defense department in the United States that they can’t understand what a subsidy is anymore because they live off them,  he said. In April Boeing asked the U.S. Commerce Department to investigate alleged subsidies and unfair pricing for Bombardier's CSeries airplane, accusing Bombardier of having sold 75 of the planes to Delta Air Lines Inc last year at a price well below cost. The U.S. International Trade Commission last month gave approval to the U.S. Commerce Department to begin preparing anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties against new jets from Bombardier  It is just outrageous that a company that's subsidized by the U.S. government as Boeing is presumes to take such an action,  Caisse's Sabia said. However, Boeing spokesman, Dan Curran, said,  Rulings by the World Trade Organization prove that assertions about subsidies to Boeing are incorrect.  Our petition to the International Trade Commission seeks to restore a level playing field in the U.S. single-aisle airplane market. This is the normal course of resolving such commercial trade disputes between two companies, and we will let that process play out. Pentagon spokesman, U.S. Navy Commander Patrick L. Evans said,  Secretary Mattis' priority for the Department of Defense is clear: to increase military readiness while gaining full value from every taxpayer dollar spent on the defense of our nation.  The Caisse has a dual mandate both to maximise returns for depositors and support economic growth in the Canadian province. Sabia said the Caisse operated independently of the Quebec government and the decision to invest in Bombardier was a commercial one.  If somebody would give me another dozen of those I would be the happiest guy in Manhattan today to put it mildly.  We have negotiated something that has no downside risk and unlimited upside exposure. Give me another dozen. Give me 20 of those.

Yutaka Harada, a member of the board of Japan's central bank, said Western policymakers helped bring Hitler to power by being slow to apply John Maynard Keynes' proposals to fight the Great Depression. Hitler had taken  wonderful  fiscal and monetary stimulus steps, which in turn led to  something horrible for the world  as his strengthened grip on power led to the Holocaust and massive human casualties during World War Two, Harada said in a seminar on monetary policy in Tokyo. Hitler became German chancellor in 1933.  Because Hitler had taken appropriate fiscal and monetary policy steps, tragedy resulted. What I'm saying is that someone should have taken appropriate fiscal and monetary policy steps before Hitler did,  said Harada, an academic-turned BOJ policymaker. Fiscal policy involves setting government spending and tax rates, whereas monetary policy involves money supply and interest rates set by a central bank. A BOJ spokesman said the central bank could not comment as it was not aware of the details of Harada's remarks. Public figures in Japan, which was part of the World War Two Axis powers with Germany and Italy, have sometimes caused controversy with favorable comments about some aspects of the Nazi regime. At the same time, however, Holocaust-denial and neo-Nazi movements are essentially unknown in Japan. Japanese Deputy Prime Minister Taro Aso drew criticism from a U.S.-based Jewish rights group over comments he made in 2013, but were later retracted, that were interpreted as praise for Germany's Nazi regime and Hitler's rise to power.

But we would do well to think about it now, as the Senate Republicans take a holiday weekend pause in their push to dismantle the Affordable Care Act. Roughly half of Americans now turning 65 will require some level of long-term care during retirement. And when professional care is required, it usually is paid for by Medicaid, which covers 62 percent of long-term care in the United States, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF). That may surprise people who think of Medicaid as a social safety net for the poor. Indeed, the program is a critical lifeline for 35 million children and 27 million adults in low-income households. But nursing home care is expensive, and 62 percent of near-retirement households have saved less than one year of annual income for retirement, according to the National Institute on Retirement Security. When savings run out, Medicaid steps in - nearly two-thirds of its spending in 2014 went to the elderly and disabled, according to KFF. “Medicaid has been a critical safety net for 50 years for people who have depleted their life savings,” said  Jean Accius, vice president of the AARP Public Policy Institute. “It is insurance for your mother or your father or eventually for yourself, because the price can be so high.” The current national system of financing long-term care is a mess. Few households purchase commercial long-term care policies, and the market has experienced upheaval in recent years as underwriters stopped writing new policies or boosted premiums by double-digit rates. Yet the Senate bill would take our already-dysfunctional system of long-term care and make it worse - much worse. The Better Care Reconciliation Act (BCRA) proposes to reduce expected Medicaid outlays by $772 billion over 10 years. That would destabilize access not only to nursing home care but home and community-based services - an innovative approach to care that saves money, and has grown quickly in recent years.  Medicaid is administered by states, but funded jointly with the federal government. Currently, the federal contribution is open-ended. Under BCRA, starting in 2020 states could opt for a federal contribution subject to a per-enrollee cap or in the form of a block grant. The contribution would be based on the current amount sent to a state, and then adjusted annually for inflation. Funding Will Shrink Proponents of BCRA argue this will not squeeze the states because the inflation adjustment will be tied to the federal measure of medical inflation (CPI-M). But as this Medicaid population ages into their 80s and 90s, their care needs will intensify and become much more expensive on a per-capita basis. And after 2025, the inflation measure would shift to a more general inflation gauge that rises much more slowly than healthcare costs. Finally, per-enrollee caps will not adjust for unanticipated major new spending needs - for instance, a major new blockbuster drug or the need to deal with a public health emergency. As federal funding falls behind, states would be left to raise taxes to meet the shortfalls, cut their budgets elsewhere or provide less Medicaid coverage. Cuts could be made first within home and community-based care, because these are optional programs under federal law, while nursing home coverage is mandatory. But nursing home coverage would suffer too, said  Jessica Schubel, senior policy analyst at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.   States may be forced to cut provider rates - which already aren’t very high,” she said. “The providers will then be forced to do more with less - they may cut staff, make fewer beds available to Medicaid patients, or close altogether.  Overall, the BCRA would increase the number of uninsured Americans by 22 million in 2026, according to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). The increase in the number of uninsured would be disproportionately large among people aged 55-64 and with income less than 200 percent of the federal poverty line. Enrollment in Medicaid would fall by 15 million by 2026.  In the insurance exchanges, premiums for older people would soar to unaffordable levels, CBO found. For example, the net premium (after tax credits) for a 64-year-old with income of $56,800 would skyrocket from $6,800 to $20,500. Taking away insurance will kill people - literally. A new study published in Annals of Medicine (bit.ly/2ua8ecp) documents how the lack of health insurance increases mortality; its math suggests that taking insurance away from 22 million people will result in 29,000 avoidable deaths annually. At the same time, the tax cuts in BCRA would reduce federal revenue by $700 billion -  with 45 percent of that going to households making $875,000 or more, according to the Tax Policy Center. The bill repeals the Affordable Care Act’s 3.8 percent net investment income tax on dividends, interest and capital gains, and the 0.9 percent Medicare payroll tax surcharge. The trade-offs in BCRA - insurance for tax cuts for the wealthy - are nothing short of appalling. Governor John Kasich of Ohio put it well while speaking out against the BCRA in Washington this week: “That’s good public policy? What, are you kidding me?” (The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.)  Editing by Matthew Lewis","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-column-miller-healthcare-idUSKBN19K1M7"},

The dollar touched its lowest since October - before Donald Trump was elected U.S. president - against its broad index , as investors shifted to the view that the U.S. Federal Reserve might not be the only game in town when it comes to higher interest rates. With the Fed's clearing of all banks in the second part of its stress tests, financials led global stocks to record highs . Worries over the impact of tighter monetary conditions on share prices were offset by confidence in robust global growth as central banks move towards normalisation. Wall Street was to open higher again after the S&P; 500 scored its biggest one-day percentage gain in two months in the previous session. As euro zone bond yields rallied, the euro surged to as high as $1.1435, its strongest since May 2016.  If all central banks sound hawkish at the same time then divergence, and therefore FX volatility, will stay low,  Deutsche Bank currency strategist George Saravelos wrote in a note to clients.  The problem with this convergence, however, is that the Fed is already in tightening flight mid-air with other central banks just about to take off the runway. With the next big question for the market the timing of a Fed 'landing', hawkish co-ordination in such an environment can do serious damage to the dollar,  he added. In Britain, Bank of England Governor Mark Carney surprised many this week by conceding a hike was likely to be needed as the economy came closer to running at full capacity. Chief economist Andy Haldane took a similar line on Thursday, saying the BoE needed to  look seriously  at hiking rates. That sent sterling surging above $1.30 for the first time in five weeks, leaving it close to its highest levels in nine months. The Bank of Canada went further, with two top policymakers this week suggesting they might tighten as early as July. And that followed comments earlier in the week from European Central Bank President Mario Draghi, who said stimulus might need to be toned down so it does not become more accommodative as the economy recovers. Arresting Deflation ECB sources had tried to hose down talk of tightening, telling Reuters on Wednesday that markets had over interpreted Draghi's comments. But those comments could not prevent Germany's 10-year government bond yield hitting a five-week high while other bond yields also climbed higher.  This is simply the central banks getting together and trying to arrest deflation,  said Nomura's head of G10 currency trading Peter Gorra. U.S. 10-year Treasuries were also up 16 basis points so far this week at 2.28 percent. European shares failed to hold onto early gains, slipping a little as utilities and construction stocks, which tend to suffer from the prospect of higher interest rates, edged lower. Shares in Europe's banks, however, rose for a fourth straight day, up 1.4 percent by 1200 GMT. For Reuters Live Markets blog on European and UK stock markets see reuters://realtime/verb=Open/url=http://emea1.apps.cp.extranet.thomsonreuters.biz/cms/?pageId=livemarkets Earlier, Japan's Nikkei added 0.45 while MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.8 percent to its highest since May 2015. The dollar's fall boosted emerging stocks.  Central banks will be very cautious in their approach,  said Martin Whetton, a senior rates strategist at ANZ.  But once they start tightening in concert, and their bloated balance sheets start unwinding, it is fair to say that bonds, equities, house prices and other asset markets will face stiffer headwinds than they have for a long time.  The euro also surged to a 16-month top on the yen, as investors doubted the Bank of Japan would be in any position to begin winding back its stimulus for a long time to come. Crude oil rose for a sixth straight session on a decline in U.S. output, hitting a two-week high after a decline in weekly U.S. production eased concerns about deepening oversupply.

The Hippodrome marked its centenary last year. But it has an aging clientele, must fend of private developers, and has lost revenue to illegal gambling. Now it is seeking a younger crowd and new investment from city authorities.   Its director general Nabil Nasrallah was on a recent day  studying the draft of an advertisement for family-friendly night races, a move he hopes will bring in more youthful punters.   Would it be better to use the phrase 'back a winner' or 'guess a winner'?  he wondered.  He proposes using what is rare patch of green in Beirut's center as a park on days when there is no racing, and hopes to restore the racecourse to its past glories with development projects. The city authorities, which own it, have not yet put in the money, he said.  On white plastic chairs in the concrete stands, amid the chatter of conversation and the gurgle of water pipes, most men watching the horses one recent Sunday were middle-aged or older. Many had patronized the Hippodrome since its 1960s heyday, when the city painted itself as the Paris of the Middle East and races drew a glittering high-society crowd.   All the presidents of republics and officials visiting from abroad used to come here, like the Shah of Iran, (Saudi) King Abdulziz and the king of Greece. It was one of the most prestigious and beautiful places in Beirut,  Nasrallah said.  Back then the original elegant grandstand was filled with spectators and 15 horses ran each race, instead of five now. The grandstand was smashed in the fighting when Israel occupied Beirut in 1982. The Hippodrome was for years on the  Green Line , the front between Lebanon's warring factions in the 1970-1995 civil war, and nearby city buildings still bear the marks of bullets and shrapnel on their ripped facades.   We had more than 10,000 people coming from east and west, from the different sides, for race meetings,  said Nasrallah of races during the war. Unlike other crossing points on the frontline, the racecourse was not a target for snipers.  A horse stands in front a bullet-riddled wall at Beirut Hippodrome, Lebanon, April 30, 2017.Jamal Saidi  SEARCHBut the Gulf sheikhs who used to race their thoroughbreds here now have racecourses in their own countries, although Islamic law bars the gambling that attracts many punters in Beirut.  Syrian Jockey Elias Yousef, a dandified 76-year-old barber sporting a scarlet handkerchief in the breast pocket of his white linen jacket, said he bets up to 100,000 Lebanese pounds ($67) a week.   It's my sickness,  he said.  Nasrallah said that illegal gambling had reduced the volume of bets placed with official bookies at the racecourse.     Slideshow (18 Images)In the VIP suite in the stand, five men sat around a table overlooking the course, filling ashtrays, emptying coffee cups and waving white betting slips.  They cheered raucously, ribbing a retired judge who had backed a horse that was disqualified for an infraction after romping home in first place.  A bell rang and spectators walked over to the white fences of an exercise yard to cast expert eyes over the horses before they ran the next race. There was a murmur of excitement and everybody rushed towards the stand, craning their necks for the start of the race.   Come on! Come on!  the crowd shouted in Arabic and French. All eyes were fixed on the red dust of the track as the horses thundered past.  The winning jockey was a Syrian, a tiny man in orange and black colors, sweat and red dust staining his face. He came to race in Lebanon after the war in Syria began, he said.  After the race, he and the other jockeys gathered in the weighing room, taking turns to sit in the harness of a wrought-iron scale while a man slowly added weights until it tilted.  Outside, Jamil Helo, aged 85, sat waiting for the last race. He has come to the races in Beirut since 1965.  Sometimes I win a little, sometimes I lose a lot,  he said.  It's in my blood.

The law is expected to be in place by late September, when a new senate and national assembly convene after August elections. Kenya announced plans last year to start small-scale production in June 2017, involving trucking about 2,000 barrels a day to the coast. The government said this was not expected to generate any profit.  After consultation with the leadership of Turkana (county) and the community, we have decided that instead of having the project commence by this month, we will defer it until the bill which is pending before the Senate,  Energy and Petroleum Cabinet Secretary Charles Keter told a news conference.  So the one-month extension (is) until the next parliament - essentially August or September. We will do it before the end of the year, because it is a programme that will run until the pipeline is done.  Kenya has an estimated 750 million barrels of recoverable reserves in onshore fields but no pipeline to take the waxy crude from the northwest to an export terminal on the east coast. Africa Oil and Tullow Oil were 50-50 partners in blocks 10 BB and 13T where the discoveries were made. Africa Oil has since sold a 25-percent stake in those blocks to A.P. Moller-Maersk. Keter said they expect to award a contract soon to a company that will carry out an environmental impact study and a front-end engineering and design (FEED) for a crude oil pipeline.  What we want right now, is to award for the environmental impact assessment and front-end engineering design, in preparation for the award for the construction of the pipeline. Anytime now, maybe by next month,  he said. (Reporting by George Obulutsa; Editing by Louise Ireland)","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/kenya-oil-idUSL8N1JQ1EG"},

Spain's population has dropped every year since 2011 after a burst property bubble in 2008 led to a near five-year recession and unemployment soared to 27 percent, dissuading migrants looking for work and sending Spaniards abroad.  The total Spanish population rose to 46.5 million, or by 88,867 people, INE said. In 2016, 354,461 foreign migrants moved to Spain -- the highest number since 2011 -- up 22.5 percent from a year earlier, while 23,540 more Spaniards moved back to the country than left it, the National Statistics Institute (INE) said. Most immigrants came from Romania, followed by Morocco then Britain, the data showed.  Spain's economy is expected to increase its pace of expansion in the second quarter from a quarter earlier, the Bank of Spain said on Thursday, on stronger domestic demand and rising employment. Seasonal jobs are a large part of the Spanish economy due to the busy tourist season and an active agricultural sector, with both attracting thousands of foreign workers every year. Construction, which plummeted during the economic slump but has since re-emerged as a key driver, also employs heavily amongst foreigners.

Below is Culture Secretary Karen Bradley's statement to parliament, lightly abridged.  I came to this House, on 16 March, to confirm that I had issued a European Intervention Notice (EIN) in relation to the proposed merger between 21st Century Fox and Sky Plc on the grounds of media plurality and commitment to broadcasting standards. The EIN triggered a requirement for Ofcom to report - initially by 16 May but extended to 20 June - on the media public interest considerations and the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) on jurisdiction.  In line with my commitments, I am today publishing both documents.      Media Plurality On the question of whether the merger gives rise to public interest concerns in relation to media plurality, Ofcom's report is unambiguous. It concludes,  The transaction raises public interest concerns as a result of the risk of increased influence by members of the Murdoch Family Trust over the UK news agenda and the political process, with its unique presence on radio, television, in print and online. We consider that the plurality concerns may justify the Secretary of State making a reference to the Competition and Markets Authority . On the basis of Ofcom's assessment, I confirm that I am minded to refer to a Phase 2 investigation on the grounds of media plurality. The reasoning and evidence on which Ofcom's recommendation is based are persuasive. The proposed entity would have the third largest total reach of any news provider - lower only than the BBC and ITN - and would, uniquely, span news coverage on television, radio, in newspapers and online. Ofcom's report states that the proposed transaction would give the Murdoch Family Trust material influence over news providers with a significant presence across all key platforms. This potentially raises public interest concerns because, in Ofcom's view, the transaction may increase members of the Murdoch Family Trust's ability to influence the overall news agenda and their ability to influence the political process and it may also result in the perception of increased influence. These are clear grounds whereby a referral to a Phase 2 investigation is warranted - so that is what I am minded to do. There is, however, a statutory process that I must follow. I am required by legislation to allow the parties the opportunity to make representations to me on this position before I reach a final decision. I will now do that and have given them until Friday 14 July to respond. Commitment to Broadcasting Standards The second question concerns whether after the merger the relevant media enterprises would have a genuine commitment to broadcasting standards. Ofcom is unequivocal. It concludes,  In light of Fox's and Sky's broadcast compliance records and taking account of our separate assessment of whether Sky remains fit and proper to hold broadcast licenses following the transaction, we do not consider that the merged entity would lack a genuine commitment to the attainment of broadcasting standards. Therefore, we consider that there are no broadcasting standards concerns that may justify a reference by the Secretary of State to the Competition and Markets Authority . Ofcom's approach sought to measure commitment to broadcasting standards by reference to breaches of regulatory codes. It found that Fox's compliance with the UK's Broadcasting Code is in line with comparable broadcasters. Nor did Fox's compliance record in relation to overseas broadcast jurisdictions (where Ofcom’s analysis focused largely on the EU) give cause for concern. I also asked Ofcom to consider the effect of any failure of corporate governance on this public interest consideration. Ofcom did this in the context of its separate assessment of whether Fox and Sky would remain fit and proper to hold broadcast licenses following the transaction. It concluded that behaviors alleged at Fox News in the U.S. amount to 'significant corporate failures'. However, these did not in its view demonstrate that the merged company would lack a genuine commitment to broadcasting standards. In reaching a view I have to be guided only by the evidence before me. As such - based on the Ofcom report - I am currently minded not to refer to a Phase 2 investigation in relation to a genuine commitment to broadcasting standards. Representations As required by legislation, I am giving the parties an opportunity to make representations in relation to media plurality grounds - where I am minded to refer for a phase two investigation by the CMA. In the interests of transparency and ensuring all the evidence has been considered, I will also invite wider representations on the question of commitment to broadcasting standards - where I am currently minded not to refer for a phase two investigation. While there are strong feelings among both supporters and opponents of this merger, in this quasi judicial process, my decisions can only be influenced by facts, not opinions - and by the quality of evidence, not who shouts the loudest. The invitation to make representations will open today and close on Friday 14 July and can be found on the DCMS website. Next Stage of the Process To be clear, the minded-to decisions I have outlined today are not my final decisions. A word before I close on Ofcom's fit and proper assessment. As the independent regulator, this is a matter for Ofcom, and my understanding is they will publish their report today. I have seen the report and know many members in this house will want to comment on it. Given my current quasi-judicial role in the merger I will not be commenting on the findings. It is rightly not for Government to determine who should, and should not, hold TV broadcasting licenses. Ofcom has an on-going duty to ensure all UK broadcasters are fit and proper to hold TV broadcasting licenses. I am clear that if any evidence comes to light then it is for Ofcom to take account of that evidence. I trust - as before - that this update is helpful to Honourable and Right Honourable Members and that this statement gives an opportunity to debate this important issue, while at the same time, respecting the limits of what I can say given my ongoing quasi-judicial role in relation to this merger. I commend this statement to the House. Reporting by Kate Holton, Paul Sandle and Alistair Smout; Editing by Mark Potter","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-sky-m-a-fox-text-idUSKBN19K1LN"},

Below is Culture Secretary Karen Bradley's statement to parliament, lightly abridged.  I came to this House, on 16 March, to confirm that I had issued a European Intervention Notice (EIN) in relation to the proposed merger between 21st Century Fox and Sky Plc on the grounds of media plurality and commitment to broadcasting standards. The EIN triggered a requirement for Ofcom to report - initially by 16 May but extended to 20 June - on the media public interest considerations and the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) on jurisdiction. In line with my commitments, I am today publishing both documents. Media Plurality On the question of whether the merger gives rise to public interest concerns in relation to media plurality, Ofcom's report is unambiguous. It concludes,  The transaction raises public interest concerns as a result of the risk of increased influence by members of the Murdoch Family Trust over the UK news agenda and the political process, with its unique presence on radio, television, in print and online. We consider that the plurality concerns may justify the Secretary of State making a reference to the Competition and Markets Authority . On the basis of Ofcom's assessment, I confirm that I am minded to refer to a Phase 2 investigation on the grounds of media plurality. The reasoning and evidence on which Ofcom's recommendation is based are persuasive. The proposed entity would have the third largest total reach of any news provider - lower only than the BBC and ITN - and would, uniquely, span news coverage on television, radio, in newspapers and online. Ofcom's report states that the proposed transaction would give the Murdoch Family Trust material influence over news providers with a significant presence across all key platforms. This potentially raises public interest concerns because, in Ofcom's view, the transaction may increase members of the Murdoch Family Trust's ability to influence the overall news agenda and their ability to influence the political process and it may also result in the perception of increased influence. These are clear grounds whereby a referral to a Phase 2 investigation is warranted - so that is what I am minded to do. There is, however, a statutory process that I must follow. I am required by legislation to allow the parties the opportunity to make representations to me on this position before I reach a final decision. I will now do that and have given them until Friday 14 July to respond. Commitment to Broadcasting Standards The second question concerns whether after the merger the relevant media enterprises would have a genuine commitment to broadcasting standards. Ofcom is unequivocal. It concludes,  In light of Fox's and Sky's broadcast compliance records and taking account of our separate assessment of whether Sky remains fit and proper to hold broadcast licences following the transaction, we do not consider that the merged entity would lack a genuine commitment to the attainment of broadcasting standards. Therefore, we consider that there are no broadcasting standards concerns that may justify a reference by the Secretary of State to the Competition and Markets Authority . Ofcom's approach sought to measure commitment to broadcasting standards by reference to breaches of regulatory codes. It found that Fox's compliance with the UK's Broadcasting Code is in line with comparable broadcasters. Nor did Fox's compliance record in relation to overseas broadcast jurisdictions (where Ofcom’s analysis focused largely on the EU) give cause for concern. I also asked Ofcom to consider the effect of any failure of corporate governance on this public interest consideration. Ofcom did this in the context of its separate assessment of whether Fox and Sky would remain fit and proper to hold broadcast licenses following the transaction. It concluded that behaviours alleged at Fox News in the U.S. amount to 'significant corporate failures'. However, these did not in its view demonstrate that the merged company would lack a genuine commitment to broadcasting standards. In reaching a view I have to be guided only by the evidence before me. As such - based on the Ofcom report - I am currently minded not to refer to a Phase 2 investigation in relation to a genuine commitment to broadcasting standards. Representations As required by legislation, I am giving the parties an opportunity to make representations in relation to media plurality grounds - where I am minded to refer for a phase two investigation by the CMA. In the interests of transparency and ensuring all the evidence has been considered, I will also invite wider representations on the question of commitment to broadcasting standards - where I am currently minded not to refer for a phase two investigation. While there are strong feelings among both supporters and opponents of this merger, in this quasi judicial process, my decisions can only be influenced by facts, not opinions - and by the quality of evidence, not who shouts the loudest. The invitation to make representations will open today and close on Friday 14 July and can be found on the DCMS website. Next Stage of the Process To be clear, the minded-to decisions I have outlined today are not my final decisions. A word before I close on Ofcom's fit and proper assessment. As the independent regulator, this is a matter for Ofcom, and my understanding is they will publish their report today. I have seen the report and know many members in this house will want to comment on it. Given my current quasi-judicial role in the merger I will not be commenting on the findings. It is rightly not for Government to determine who should, and should not, hold TV broadcasting licences. Ofcom has an on-going duty to ensure all UK broadcasters are fit and proper to hold TV broadcasting licences. I am clear that if any evidence comes to light then it is for Ofcom to take account of that evidence. I trust - as before - that this update is helpful to Honourable and Right Honourable Members and that this statement gives an opportunity to debate this important issue, while at the same time, respecting the limits of what I can say given my ongoing quasi-judicial role in relation to this merger. I commend this statement to the House. (Reporting by Kate Holton, Paul Sandle and Alistair Smout; Editing by Mark Potter)","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/sky-ma-fox-idUSL8N1JQ38L"},

The reform is a cornerstone in Prime Minister Juha Sipila's plan to balance Finland's public finances and boost the Finnish economy after a decade of stagnation. The health care reform would include spending cuts of 3 billion euros ($3.4 billion). The health care system currently runs on a mix of public and private providers. The government has said it wants to boost competition between the two by opening up more opportunities to the private sector while still incorporating public service providers.  The committee found that privatisation would endanger citizens equal access to social and health services , Annika Lapintie, committee chairman and lawmaker in the opposition party Left Alliance, said at a news conference. To pass the reform in parliament Sipila's government needs approval from the committee, which oversees constitutional law. Finland does not have a constitutional court as found in many other countries. The government responded by saying it would implement the reform as planned but that it would  study the committee's statement ... and make a supplementary proposal without delay.  It did not elaborate on what the extra proposal would entail. Finland's centre-right coalition agreed on the complex set of reforms spanning health care and regional administration in December, after years of negotiations. The issue nearly toppled the government in 2015. On a state visit to China, Sipila did also not give any details on possible changes.  Amending the proposal will take weeks. The process moves to early autumn , Sipila was cited as saying by Finnish media. The committed had said the planned implementation of the reform in January 2019 was unrealistic and called on the government to bring a new or amended bill to the parliament. Overall, the government plans to find savings worth 10 billion euros to balance public finances over the long term.

Writing in German weekly magazine Wirtschaftswoche, Padoan said the decision to wind down the two banks at a possible cost of up to 17 billion euros was a necessary intervention to save the economy of the Veneto region. German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble and Bundesbank president Jens Weidmann have both bemoaned Italy's decision, which was approved by the European Commission and involves the state rather than investors bearing most of the cost. This goes against the spirit of a framework known as the banking union agreed by European Union member states after the 2008 financial crisis.  The banking union was adopted and devised after many countries put enormous amounts of taxpayers' money into the stabilisation of their banking sectors,  Padoan wrote in a column to be published on Friday.  We are talking about hundreds of billions in Germany and Britain.  Padoan added:  I think the rules are there in order to deal with problems in a fair way that serves the public interest.  The deal to wind down Banca Popolare di Vicenza and Veneto Banca allows Italy to solve a banking crisis on its own terms, ensuring the two Veneto lenders are not wound down under potentially tougher European rules. Weidmann said on Thursday he saw no willingness by euro zone countries to shift the decision-making powers to a European level and this was evident  not only in the handling of budget rules but also in the adherence to new rules on winding down banks, especially by countries demanding more mutual liability . His full column will appear in Wirtschaftswoche on Friday. (Reporting by Joseph Nasr; Editing by Toby Chopra)","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/eurozone-banks-italy-padoan-idUSL8N1JQ2R1"},

Three days of the biggest gains in more than a year for the single currency have pushed the broader dollar index to its lowest since October and prompted some of the market's biggest dollar supporters to call the currency's rally over. Draghi's speech on Tuesday - coming amid a raft of hawkish signals from other major global central banks - convinced markets the ECB was preparing to start withdrawing its own emergency stimulus for the euro zone economy later this year. After a long run lower, that has put the euro back in relatively uncharted territory, some analysts argue there is little technical resistance beneath $1.20. The currency steadied around $1.14 as U.S. traders arrived at their desks on Thursday.  The biggest test will be 1.1500,  said RBC's head of global FX strategy Elsa Lignos.  Though month-end USD selling may reinforce the bearish USD sentiment in the next few days, we still think EUR’s rally is more likely to run out of steam at 1.15.  The euro was also half a percent higher against the yen at 128.435 yen. A third of a percent gain for the dollar against the yen also pointed to a slightly more robust performance for the dollar as the European morning wore on.  The July 4 holiday is on Tuesday, so a lot of the U.S. community will take the Monday off,  said Richard Benson, co-head of portfolio investment with currency fund Millennium Global in London.  That means we are entering the quarter-end already today.   It may be a bit illiquid and a bit messier from here.  The other big gainers among the G10 group of major developed world currencies over the past 24 hours were the Canadian dollar and sterling, both also driven by comments by their respective central bank governors. Sterling gained another third of a percent in morning trade in London, briefly topping $1.30 for the first time in five weeks. Eyes were also shifting to other central banks, including Sweden's Riksbank, which meets next week and has previously resisted tightening monetary controls in an economy that has generally been growing strongly for two years.  This is simply the central banks getting together and trying to arrest inflation,  said Nomura's head of G10 currency trading Peter Gorra of the messages sent by officials in the past week.  They are trying to be as smart as they can and agreeing that they have to act in unison. I don't think this is necessarily a dollar move and I don't think the dollar's rally is over. They are just trying to add some two-way risk to the market.

Jane Joan Kimathi has seen desperate women with fertility problems paraded in front of praying congregations in Kenya, only to return nine months later with a baby in their arms, although she declined to name the institutions involved.      Churches prey on the frailties of their congregation while pretending to offer miracle babies to couples who have had problems conceiving,  said Kimathi, 44, who lives in a quiet convent in Karen, a leafy suburb of Kenya's capital Nairobi. Kimathi has been rescuing and reintegrating trafficking victims for more than a decade through her Catholic order, The Congregation of Our Lady of Charity of the Good Shepherd. Kenya is a source, transit and destination country for men, women and children subjected to forced labor and sex trafficking, the U.S. Department of State's 2017 Trafficking in Persons (TIP) report said on Tuesday.  Corruption remained endemic at all levels of government, and traffickers were able to fraudulently obtain identity documents from complicit officials,  it said, with children from across the region being trafficked in Kenya for sex and labor. A government hotline received almost 1,200 reports of child trafficking in 2016, it said. Action Needed Little action has been taken since 2004 when Kenyan preacher Gilbert Deya, who is fighting extradition from Britain, was exposed for delivering trafficked  miracle babies  to infertile women, Kimathi said. Women who believed they were pregnant after being given herbs traveled to Kenya from Britain to  deliver  with Deya's wife, who was jailed for stealing a baby in 2005 from a Nairobi hospital.  Clinics in Nairobi slums continue to sell babies, whose mothers are told their infants died during delivery, for thousands of dollars, local media report.   The odds seem stacked against humanity,  said Kimathi.  No one speaks. The leaders do not condemn it.  A government spokesman declined to comment while the attorney general's office shared a speech in which he said the government was working to educate officials about trafficking. Kenya prosecuted 281 trafficking cases in 2016 and secured 105 convictions, the TIP report said.  Heartbreaking Kimathi's church has rescued almost 3,000 Kenyan children who were sold into slavery for domestic labor, sex work and begging over the last decade.  It is fulfilling to know you are helping someone into a better life,  said Kimathi, who spent seven years working in refugee camps in Ivory Coast before focusing on trafficking.  (But it is also) heartbreaking because we do not get to save everybody.  Her church provides safe houses and counseling to survivors, helps them set up businesses and, where possible, reunites them with their families. Most of the girls she rescues are domestic workers to close relatives who have promised to send them to school. Others are sold as  sex slaves to men their fathers' age  or for  ritual cleansing by men who believe that sex with an underage girl is a cure for HIV , she said. One 15-year-old girl she rescued from Kenya's coast, where sex tourism is rife, had been  married  to four men, after her uncle took her away from home, promising to send her to school. While the government provides some support to children, services for trafficked adults are  negligible , the TIP report said, with charities often funding their repatriation to Kenya. Kimathi often goes to Nairobi airport to meet trafficked women being deported home, after a tip off from sister churches in Germany and The Netherlands. The greatest challenge, she said, is rescuing women from the Middle East, where many are abused as domestic workers despite the government's assignment in 2016 of labor attaches to its Saudi Arabian and Qatari missions to help them.

The treatment is almost impossible for Libyan families to obtain due to the collapse of the health system and an economic crisis that makes sending patients abroad unaffordable. The doctors have been visiting eastern Libya since 2012, but did not go to Benghazi for two years because of fighting that has destroyed parts of the city and is still raging in one downtown neighbourhood. This time they hope to operate on 30-40 children, though the final number will depend on the complexity of children's' defects. Most are under three years old. Some could die within weeks without the treatment. Khaled al-Fellah's 19-month old daughter Zahra was among the first to receive the surgery.  Her heart problem was discovered the day of her birth ... We received basic treatment to maintain the condition as there were no possibilities (for medical care),  he said.  The diagnosis was wrong many times. When the diagnosis was correct a surgery had to be performed. We should have had this surgery 10 months ago.  The team is led by William Novick, an American doctor who set up a foundation that has treated children with heart disease in more than 30 developing countries. They train local staff as they work. Initially the trips to Libya were paid for by Libyan public funds, but these dried up and they now depend on private donations. For the past three years rival alliances have been battling for power in Libya, setting up competing governments in Tripoli and the east. Benghazi, where forces loyal to Khalifa Haftar have been fighting Islamists and other opponents, has seen some of the heaviest violence. A U.N.-backed government has been trying to establish itself in Tripoli since last March, but Haftar and the eastern government have rejected it. Across the country, public services have continued a slow decline. The health sector, which was heavily dependent on foreign staff before Libya's 2011 revolution, has been crippled by their departure in the turmoil that followed. Medical supplies and equipment are in short supply, and many hospitals are shut or barely functional. Conditions at the Benghazi Medical Centre have got worse, Novick said.  The staff is gone. The maintenance of the hospital is low,  he said.  I've found that the situation has very much deteriorated since 2012.  Reida El Oakley, the health minister for the eastern government, said a private clinic in Tripoli is the only medical facility in the country that offers heart operations. The 28,000 Libyan dinar ($20,000) cost is prohibitive for Libyans who  go bankrupt to treat their children  but struggle to withdraw even a few hundred dinars from the bank because of a liquidity crisis. Trips by Novick's teams have been delayed because of funding shortages. Lives have been lost because of a lack of treatment, said Oakley.

Much of the increase in LNG capacity is because of the rapid boost to plants in Australia and the United States, as both countries take advantage of abundant local reserves of natural gas to muscle in on a market that until recently had been dominated by a few established producers and buyers. But it is perhaps ironic that while the action on the capacity side of LNG is an Australian and American story, the ultimate controlling player of the emerging global natural gas market is likely to be Europe. This is because Europe is likely to act as a  clearing house  for surplus LNG cargoes, given it has excess re-gasification capacity and the ability to use the fuel for a variety of purposes, from power generation to manufacturing to household heating. Europe is also the only region that can effectively arbitrage between LNG and pipeline prices, given its connection to Russian and other Eastern natural gas via pipelines. The continent is also best-placed to use market forces to find a price level for natural gas versus its competitors, given it still has substantial coal-fired power in some countries as well as being a leader in renewables such as wind and solar. To understand Europe's role in the LNG market, it's worth examining how the dynamics of trade in the super-chilled fuel are changing with the rise of Australia and the United States. LNG has traditionally been an opaque and tightly-controlled market, where a small number of exporters signed long-term, oil-linked contracts with an equally small number of buyers, who were more concerned about energy security than price. The major producers included Qatar, Indonesia and Malaysia, while the top buyers were concentrated in North Asia, namely Japan and South Korea, and also in Europe. It was inevitable that this situation would be disrupted once global energy giants such as Chevron, Royal Dutch Shell, ConocoPhillips and Exxon Mobil decided to pour some $200 billion into developing eight new LNG projects in Australia. Three of these are ground-breaking ventures based on using coal-seam gas as feedstock, one is the biggest floating LNG project and the rest are conventional offshore gas to onshore liquefaction plants. When the last of these new plants is operating, most likely by 2018, Australia will have around 80 million tonnes of annual LNG capacity, overtaking Qatar as the top exporter of the fuel. Not far behind Australia on the development scale is the United States, with 16 million tonnes of LNG capacity already operating at the Sabine Pass facility in the Gulf of Mexico. A further 60.5 million tonnes of annual capacity is under construction, and will arrive from late in 2017 to the end of 2019, with the bulk scheduled to be commissioned in 2018. Lng the Last to Boom and Bust? The International Gas Union (IGU), the industry's lobby group, said in its annual review in April that there was 340 million tonnes of LNG capacity as at the end of 2016, and a further 114 million tonnes under construction as of the start of this year. In some ways, LNG is the last cab off the rank in the commodity boom that saw massive capacity expansions in iron ore, coal and crude oil as part of the recovery from the 2008 global recession. Much of the investment in commodity projects was driven by the belief that China, the world's top commodity consumer and importer, would continue to soak up everything the world could throw at it. As can be seen from the five years of price declines for coal and iron ore from 2011 to 2015, this was a forlorn hope, even though China has continued to increase its imports of natural resources. LNG is equally likely to move into an oversupply situation by 2020, notwithstanding increased imports by China and the emergence of new buyers in Asia, such as Pakistan and Singapore. It's this oversupply dynamic that is changing the way LNG is traded, with buyers no longer willing to lock into long-term contracts linked to the price of crude oil. While it will take several years for these contracts to disappear entirely, buyers are having success in negotiating shorter-term deals, or even taking more spot cargoes. As a consequence, the spot price of LNG in Asia has plummeted in recent years. From a record $20.50 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) in February 2014, LNG was last at $5.40 in the week to June 23, down nearly 75 percent. The drop in Asian spot LNG prices has led them to converge with prices in Europe, with the British National Balancing Point (NBP) price actually exceeding the Asian spot price in May and June last year, according to the IGU. The difference between the two benchmarks averaged just 91 cents per mmBtu in 2016, the IGU said, showing how dramatically the Asian premium has narrowed in recent years, having been as high as $6 per mmBtu at the end of 2013. Front-month NBP futures ended at the equivalent of $4.88 per mmBtu on June 28, meaning spot the Asian LNG price commanded a premium of just 52 U.S. cents. Benchmark U.S. Henry Hub natural gas futures were at $3.067 per mmBtu on June 28, showing that the three main regional benchmarks are fairly close to each other. This becomes even more the case when the approximately $1.50 per mmBtu cost of liquefaction, already included in the spot Asian price, is added to the NBP and Henry Hub prices. The economics of the LNG market then come down to shipping costs across various routes, and it's here that Europe comes into its own. It's highly unlikely that Australian LNG will flow to the Atlantic Basin, given the long sea voyage, which adds to the cost but also increases the loss from boil-off of the LNG being shipped. This means Australian LNG will have to find a home in Asia, either among traditional buyers or emerging markets in Southeast Asia, where its geographic position gives it an advantage over Qatar and producers in Africa or the United States. The swing supplier will likely be the United States, which can ship to both Europe and Asia, as well as Latin America. It's also likely that Qatar may feel increasing pressure in Asia as it has to compete with new Australian supplies, meaning it either has to find new buyers in East Asia or push more cargoes westward to Europe. Flows Show Changing World The new dynamics of LNG trade can already be seen in flows around the world. In 2016, 278.9 million tonnes of LNG moved by ship globally, according to vessel-tracking and port data compiled by Thomson Reuters, a 7.6 percent hike from the 259.2 million  shipped the prior year. Of that total, 41.7 million tonnes went to Europe, while 156.5 million went to North Asia, which includes Japan, South Korea and China, and 33.2 million was shipped to the rest of Asia. Back in 2013 total LNG trade stood at 243.9 million tonnes, with 38.5 million going to Europe, 151.5 million to North Asia and 17.7 million to the rest of Asia. What this shows is that Europe and North Asia grew slowly in the past four years, while emerging Asia surged on the back of rising imports by India and newer buyers such as Singapore and Pakistan, and even by traditional exporters like Malaysia. Looking at the breakdown by exporting country shows that Australia has gone from shipping 23.7 million tonnes in 2013 to 46.1 million in 2016. Of Australian shipments in 2016, 39.6 million tonnes went to North Asia, up from 21.4 million in 2013.  Qatar shipped 34.7 million tonnes to North Asia in 2016, down from 40.5 million in 2013. It seems clear that Australia is supplanting Qatar as the main supplier to North Asian markets, a trend that's likely to continue as the Pacific nation brings another 40 million tonnes of LNG capacity on line by 2018. Qatar has had success in boosting its shipments to the rest of Asia and to Europe, but it will also face pressure in those markets. Australia has gone from shipping 65,900 tonnes, or just one cargo, to the rest of Asia in 2013 to supplying 3.1 million tonnes in 2016, and it's likely that its producers, especially those on the northwest coast, will be trying to gain a bigger foothold in markets like India and Sri Lanka. Overall, the global LNG market is becoming more competitive, driven by increased supply and buyer demands for more flexibility. These trends are set to continue in the coming years, creating a far larger spot market and likely seeing the demise of restrictive destination clauses and oil-linked pricing. It's also the case that much of the demand growth for LNG will be concentrated in Asia, but that doesn't necessarily mean the region will become the hub for LNG. The main problem in establishing an LNG trading hub is that the fuel isn't just simply a natural gas version of crude oil. Long-term storage is problematic given the boil-off that occurs when LNG is placed in land-based tanks or on ships. While newer LNG vessels can use boil-off as fuel for the engines, it's unlikely that LNG can be stored and traded multiple times, as is currently common in crude oil. Singapore would like to become Asia's LNG hub, but this would require massive infrastructure investment and the development of a regional pipeline system that would allow LNG to be re-gasified and then transported and stored. While this may happen over time, the absence of storage and interconnecting pipelines across Asia limits the continent's chances of being the center of the LNG universe. Rather, it's Europe with its plentiful re-gasification capacity and pipeline and storage infrastructure that can play that role. Among European countries, Spain has the best potential as an LNG hub, given its proximity to Qatar (through the Suez canal), West and North African producers and the United States. Spain has 49 million tonnes per annum in re-gasification capacity, but only 21 percent of this was being utilized in January this year, according to the IGU. Elsewhere in Europe, Britain has 35 million tonnes of re-gasification but, like Spain, only 21 percent was in use in January. In contrast Japan's 197 million tonnes of capacity had a utilization rate of 43 percent, South Korea's 101 million tonnes was used at 35 percent and China's 49 million tonnes at 56 percent. While it's clear that the big buyers in North Asia can take more LNG, it's also obvious that Spain and Britain can take substantially more LNG. They also have the means to use the natural gas, while demand in both Japan and South Korea has been largely steady in recent years, although China is witnessing strong growth. Overall, when the rest of Australia's LNG hits the market, it will likely push more Qatari cargoes to Europe. As the U.S. LNG comes on stream, it can choose whether to got to Europe or Asia depending on the price. Europe will become the destination of last resort for an increasing number of spot LNG cargoes, meaning it gets to set the price that determines where the fuel goes. Despite being a substantially smaller market than Asia, Europe will become the kingmaker in LNG. Editing by Richard Pullin","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/column-russell-lng-idUSL3N1JQ1Z4"},

France's biggest telecoms operator sees new banking services as one of its key drivers for growth, hoping to lure some 2 million customers over 10 years. A spokesman for the company confirmed the decision and said that Orange Bank had  to extend and broaden the test phase  of the service. It had been due to launch on July 6. Orange Bank would offer its customers use of an instant, secure mobile payment service as well as a free debit card. Its online app will also make it possible for users to transfer money via a text message to another Orange account. However, CFE-CGC trade union official Sebastien Crozier said the test phase had thrown up some problems.  We provided feedback to signal many incidents related to the quality of the user interface and the customer service,  Crozier said by telephone. France's largest online banks, ING Direct and SocGen's Boursorama, have some 1 million clients each. Stephane Beyazian, an analyst at brokerage Raymond James, said investors were cautious over the prospects for Orange Bank, with the French banking sector dominated by BNP Paribas , Societe Generale, Credit Agricole and BPCE . About 2,000 French Orange employees are currently testing and using the app. Orange Bank aims to break even in four to five years. It was formed after the acquisition of a 65 percent stake in Groupama Banque last year.

Yutaka Harada, a member of the board of Japan's central bank, said Western policymakers helped bring Hitler to power by being slow to apply John Maynard Keynes' proposals to fight the Great Depression. Hitler had taken  wonderful  fiscal and monetary stimulus steps, which in turn led to  something horrible for the world  as his strengthened grip on power led to the Holocaust and massive human casualties during World War Two, Harada said in a seminar on monetary policy in Tokyo. Hitler became German chancellor in 1933.  Because Hitler had taken appropriate fiscal and monetary policy steps, tragedy resulted. What I'm saying is that someone should have taken appropriate fiscal and monetary policy steps before Hitler did,  said Harada, an academic-turned BOJ policymaker. Fiscal policy involves setting government spending and tax rates, whereas monetary policy involves money supply and interest rates set by a central bank. A BOJ spokesman said the central bank could not comment as it was not aware of the details of Harada's remarks. Public figures in Japan, which was part of the World War Two Axis powers with Germany and Italy, have sometimes caused controversy with favorable comments about some aspects of the Nazi regime. At the same time, however, Holocaust-denial and neo-Nazi movements are essentially unknown in Japan. Japanese Deputy Prime Minister Taro Aso drew criticism from a U.S.-based Jewish rights group over comments he made in 2013, but were later retracted, that were interpreted as praise for Germany's Nazi regime and Hitler's rise to power.

BT lost a fifth of its value in January after a 530 million pound ($687 million) writedown, partly due to financial irregularities found at the Italian division. The Financial Reporting Council (FRC), which can fine auditing firms and accountants and ban individuals from the accountancy profession in England and Wales, said it would investigate PwC's audits from 2015 to 2017. FRC is now expected to gather evidence before drafting any formal complaint. FRC has open investigations into each of the  Big Four  global accounting firms, which include PwC. The four firms audit more than 95 percent of the biggest 350 London-listed companies, despite efforts to draw in new competitors. BT filed a criminal complaint in Italy in April that accused several former executives and other staff of unlawful conduct. Current and former staff said efforts to hide the Italian unit's performance had gone on since at least 2013. BT said this month it would drop PwC, its auditors since 1984, after an evaluation found  areas for improvement . It said it would move to KPMG, another one of the  Big Four . PwC said it would continue to cooperate with the FRC, saying the regulator had a duty to investigate where it believed there was public interest and to give confidence to financial markets.  The FRC's annual reviews of our audit work, policies and procedures show a continued trend of improvement in our work and we use the FRC's insights, together with our own reviews, to continuously improve how we deliver high quality audits,  a PwC spokesman said. The regulator said it would conduct the inquiry in a  timely and robust manner  but declined to comment whether it would investigate individual auditors, accountants or actuaries employed by either PwC or BT alongside PwC itself. Such inquiries investigate how audits are planned and structured, whether auditors sufficiently challenged management and policies, whether significant risks were identified and if audits complied with international standards. The Serious Fraud Office (SFO), which investigates and prosecutes complex and often multinational fraud and corruption, declined to comment whether it planned a criminal investigation into BT. PwC was also auditor of Tesco, the British grocer that agreed a 129 million pound deferred prosecution deal with the SFO in April over a 2014 scandal. The SFO has charged three former Tesco directors with fraud and false accounting. But PwC escaped sanction by the FRC, which this month ended an inquiry into the auditor because it said there was no realistic prospect of a tribunal deciding a sanction. The FRC closed its inquiry into Tesco's former chief financial officer Laurie McIlwee last year, but said this month that  certain other members of the accountancy bodies  remained under investigation. $1 = 0.7717 pounds Additional reporting by Kirstin Ridley; Editing by Kate Holton, David Evans and Edmund Blair","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bt-group-audit-investigation-idUSL8N1JQ10A"},

Even as it champions the Paris climate agreement, Japan - the world's fifth-biggest carbon emitter - continues its massive reliance on coal and natural gas, putting it out of step with the rest of the Group of Seven bloc and even South Korea.  Coal is seen by Japan's powerful industry ministry as an important part of the country's energy mix after the closure of nuclear reactors in the wake of the 2011 Fukushima disaster.  It doesn't matter if they are highly efficient or not, power stations using coal are seen outdated as EU (European Union) and other countries are moving away from them,  Environment Minister Kouichi Yamamoto told Reuters in an interview on Thursday.  We are against coal-fired power plants, but the issue isn't whether we are for or against it, but that there may come a time when they will no longer be accepted by the world at large,  he said.  Coal now accounts for about 31 percent of Japan's power generation mix. Over the next decade, companies plan to build 41 new coal-fired power stations, according to data from government and companies.  If all those plants are built, it will become a major obstacle for Japan's 2030 target to cut emissions,  said Yamamoto. Under the Paris deal, Japan has pledged to trim its carbon emissions by 26 percent in 2030 from 2013 levels. Japan's Environment Minister Koichi Yamamoto speaks during an interview with Reuters in Tokyo, Japan June 29, 2017.Kim Kyung-HoonThe ministry estimates that Japan's emissions could exceed its 2030 target by 70 million tonnes if all the coal power plants were built.  Yamamoto said carbon pricing can help Japan hit its further target to slashing emissions by 80 percent by 2050. Japan's Environment Minister Koichi Yamamoto speaks during an interview with Reuters in Tokyo, Japan June 29, 2017.Kim Kyung-Hoon By 2050, we don't aim to lower carbon, but we aim to exit from carbon. Carbon pricing is the most efficient tool to help us achieve the 2050 goal,  Yamamoto said. The environment ministry recently set up a panel to discuss an appropriate carbon pricing. But the industry ministry has opposed it, claiming Japan already has high taxes on oil and coal, along with environment tax.  We are not saying that we should implement carbon pricing, but we are saying we should talk and think about how Japan can come up with our own model based on other countries' experiences,  he said. Yamamoto said he was disappointed at the recent decision of the United States to withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement.  He was involved in the adoption of the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 which the U.S. did not ratify.  The Kyoto Protocol was mainly to enhance developed countries to combat global warming, but the Paris climate pact is for all countries and underlines a big advancement,  he said.  Therefore, the U.S. withdrawal this time has a much bigger implication than that from the Kyoto Protocol.

Heaps of rotting rubbish have been steadily growing in Athens neighbourhoods, raising fears of health risks as the country swelters in its first heatwave of the year. With temperatures above 40 degrees (104 Fahrenheit) in some parts of the country, public sanitation workers who say their jobs are under threat marched through central Athens, many of them wearing their fluorescent work vests. Some chanted  Tsipras your contract is up,  a reference to Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, whose creditor-mandated austerity has seen him trailing in opinion polls.  We want them (the government) to meet their promises. They promised to give us permanent jobs,  said one worker, Marina Tsoukala, 57.  I'm close to pensionable age ... what private company would take us on?  Garbage collectors fear job losses from new regulations governing short-term contract workers in the broader public sector, which includes local government. A court order banning extensions to short-term contracts could leave up to 10,000 jobs on the line. Greek authorities had offered a compromise, giving existing contractors precedence in getting contract renewal. Job security is a sensitive issue in Greece, where one in four is unemployed as the country wrestles with its seventh year of austerity sought by international creditors in return for bailouts. With temperatures soaring, Athenians were advised to keep rubbish indoors to avoid it becoming fodder for rodents out on the streets. However, many neighbourhoods were struggling with piles of trash overflowing from large wheelie bins.  Its simply intolerable,  said a woman who only identified herself as Vassiliki, 40.  I live on the fifth floor and the stench wafts up there. There are mosquitoes and flies, the smell is just awful.

Sources familiar with BASF's thinking have said that competition regulators looking at potential buyers of antitrust-related assets might favor new entrants to the seed market, such as BASF, over established players to stoke competition in a quickly consolidating market.  There are assets that will come to market for antitrust reasons and they might come at prices that are different from those that we have seen in the past. That's why we will look into it and see whether it makes sense for us,  deputy Chief Executive Martin Brudermueller told a news conference at the group's headquarters.  Seed assets are an option, not a must,  he added. Rival Bayer (BAYGn.DE) last month said it will sell its LibertyLink-branded seeds businesses, a key part of asset sales required to satisfy competition authorities looking at its $66 billion Monsanto deal. BASF, the world's third-largest maker of crop chemicals, has so far avoided seed assets and has voiced scepticism that a combination of the two businesses would make sense for it. Instead it has pursued research into plant characteristics such as drought tolerance, which it sells or licenses out to seed breeders. Rival Syngenta (SYNN.S), the Swiss crop protection company acquired by ChemChina, this week vowed to bulk up its seeds business and join the chase for the assets that Bayer must sell. BASF is the only player left among the top six in a global seeds and pesticides market worth over $100 billion that has not paired up with a major peer.

The annual song fest was hosted in Kiev without a hitch, but the run-up to the competition was marred by Moscow's decision to boycott the event after Ukraine barred its entrant because she had performed in Russia-annexed Crimea.  As a result of this, attention was drawn away from the competition and the brand reputation of the Eurovision Song Contest was endangered,  the EBU said in a statement.  Therefore the contest's steering committee ... has recommended that UA:PBC (Ukraine's state broadcaster) should receive a substantial fine, in line with the rules of the competition,  it said, without saying how much Ukraine would have to pay. UA:PBC Director Zurab Alasania said the fine was 200,000 euros ($228,100) and that the broadcaster would appeal the decision.  Formally, it wasn't us who made the decision not to allow her (Russian singer Yulia Samoylova), but I don't think that the SBU (State Security Service) or the government will want to take part in this,  Alasania told Reuters. Last week, UA:PBC said authorities in Geneva had frozen 15 million euros given by Kiev to the EBU as a guarantee for the successful hosting of Eurovision. It was not immediately clear if this was linked to the EBU's decision to fine Ukraine.

More than 800,000 ethnic Tutsis and moderate Hutus were slaughtered during a three-month killing spree by Hutu extremists after a plane carrying the president, Juvenal Habyarimana, was shot down. The three groups - Sherpa, CPCR (Collective of Civil Parties for Rwanda) and Ibuka France - said on Thursday that their suit accused BNP Paribas of complicity in genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. They said a U.N. arms embargo on Rwanda had been in effect at the time of the transfer. In an emailed statement to Reuters, BNP Paribas said:  We have learned about the suit through the media. At the moment, we do not have sufficient information on the subject to be able to comment on it.  Rwandan central bank governor John Rwangombwa told Reuters in a Whatsapp message that he had no comment on the matter. The statement from the NGOs said that Hutu colonel Théoneste Bagosora had agreed the purchase of 80 tonnes of arms with a dealer on June 17, 1994, and that these were delivered to Gisenyi in Rwanda via Goma, a city in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The U.N. Security Council had put an arms embargo in place the previous month. Bagosora, 70, is serving a 35-year sentence for crimes against humanity in connection with the Rwandan genocide. The NGOs said that BNP's predecessor, Banque Nationale de Paris, which merged with Paribas in 2000 to create BNP Paribas, had knowingly accepted the transfer of $1.3 million from its client, the Rwandan central bank, to the arms dealer's Swiss account.  According to the numerous testimonies and investigative reports attached to the complaint, BNP would have certainly known the destination of the funds,  the NGOs said. Rwanda opened an inquiry in November into the possible role of at least 20 French military and other officials in the 1994 genocide. Rwanda, a former German and Belgian colony, had strong ties with France until 1994. Under its current president, Paul Kagame, it has forged close links with the United States and Britain.

Sources familiar with BASF's thinking have said that competition regulators looking at potential buyers of antitrust-related assets might favor new entrants to the seed market, such as BASF, over established players to stoke competition in a quickly consolidating market.  There are assets that will come to market for antitrust reasons and they might come at prices that are different from those that we have seen in the past. That's why we will look into it and see whether it makes sense for us,  deputy Chief Executive Martin Brudermueller told a news conference at the group's headquarters.  Seed assets are an option, not a must,  he added. Rival Bayer (BAYGn.DE) last month said it will sell its LibertyLink-branded seeds businesses, a key part of asset sales required to satisfy competition authorities looking at its $66 billion Monsanto deal. BASF, the world's third-largest maker of crop chemicals, has so far avoided seed assets and has voiced scepticism that a combination of the two businesses would make sense for it. Instead it has pursued research into plant characteristics such as drought tolerance, which it sells or licenses out to seed breeders. Rival Syngenta (SYNN.S), the Swiss crop protection company acquired by ChemChina, this week vowed to bulk up its seeds business and join the chase for the assets that Bayer must sell. BASF is the only player left among the top six in a global seeds and pesticides market worth over $100 billion that has not paired up with a major peer.

Andrew Bailey said the starting point was whether there has been a structural change in how people buy and sell cars in Britain and what this means.  My hunch is there has been. It has become more like the U.S. market,  Bailey told reporters.  It has become more of a secured finance market than it was in the past.  In recent rapid growth in consumer credit, which the Bank of England again highlighted this week, cars were  quite a big part of the story , Bailey said. The FCA has been in  quite a lot of talks  with U.S. regulators because they have longer experience of the auto financing market, he added. The BoE's latest Financial Stability Report published this week said consumer credit has been growing much faster than household incomes in recent years. Car finance offered by dealers has seen the fastest growth, making up 30 percent of credit. Under  personal contract purchases , the customer pays a fraction of the car's price as a deposit, and then pays regular monthly instalments, with the ability to buy the car at a price agreed at the start. The guaranteed price is typically used to buy a new car, thus ensuring a continuous demand for vehicles. Dealership finance, mainly provided by units of global car makers, has seen an average annual growth rate of around 20 percent since 2012, the BoE report said. Around 85 percent of new car purchases used dealership finance in 2016, compared with about half in 2009, the BoE report said. Bailey said there was a need to look at the link between the value of the car and borrowing.  If you talked to U.S. bankers on this, they'll tell you stories about what worked and didn't work in the U.S.   You have to look at the conduct that's going on in the terms of how the lending is being advanced to people and what they understand about it,  Bailey said. The BoE said in March that its banking supervisory arm was also reviewing credit quality in new lending in dealership car finance.

The private equity firm is buying Staples for $6.9 billion. Handing over a near-20 percent premium for the struggling office supplies retailer looks foolhardy. As at many other chains, the top line at Staples has been declining. The company’s revenue has fallen more than 7 percent over its last two fiscal years, and those declines are continuing. Staples posted an operating loss in its most recent year. According to Eikon, analysts are expecting revenue to fall for the next three years. Sycamore's deal requires a fancy calculator to add up. Assume the buyers write a check for 30 percent of the deal's value, which would be lower than the average. If the company can then match analysts’ estimates for next year’s EBITDA of $1.3 billion and maintain that performance over five years, it could afford dividends of roughly $300 million a year. Selling the company at the same 5.3 times EBITDA as the purchase price, and assuming no debt is paid down in the meantime, Sycamore would post a 15 percent annual return. That hardly gives the private equity firm much cushion if it can’t lure customers into buying more printers and post-it notes. But paying those dividends will be a stretch. The company currently has nine banks listed as financiers, suggesting that no single bank is willing to take on a lot of the deal risk. They will want the company to use free cash flow to pay down debt. If not, firms like Staples enter dangerous territory. The retail, restaurants, and consumer products sectors have accounted for a quarter of all defaults this year, according to S&P; Global Ratings. They comprised only a tenth at this point last year. Most turnarounds require some investment. If Staples finds it must use most of its cash to pay off debt, it will struggle to nurse itself back to health. Sycamore can prod the company to pay dividends or invest in propping up EBITDA - but probably not both. The private equity firm is already elbows deep in trying to revive retail businesses. The paper shredders Staples sells may come in handy. The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist.

Delivery Hero will become the fourth major online food delivery firm to go public in recent years, following GrubHub (GRUB.N), Just Eat (JE.L) and Takeaway.com (TKWY.AS), which have all seen their share price soar since listing. Delivery Hero is on course to trade at a premium to its peers and while some analysts say this is justified by its bigger global footprint, others are concerned that it is still making heavy losses. GrubHub and Just East are both profitable. Consultants McKinsey estimate the global food takeaway market is worth 83 billion euros, growing at just 3.5 percent a year. However, online apps are rapidly taking over from called-in orders, with McKinsey predicting they will account for 58 percent of the total market by 2020, from 36 percent in 2016. Founded in Berlin in 2011, Delivery Hero is riding that wave and now employs more than 6,000 people, providing a digital platform to order meals from more than 150,000 restaurants in 40 countries in Europe, the Middle East, Latin America and Asia. The listing should provide a boost to struggling German ecommerce investor Rocket Internet, which holds a 35-percent stake in Delivery Hero, although its shares came under pressure on Wednesday after U.S. meal-kit provider Blue Apron Holdings Inc (APRN.N) raised a third less than it had hoped in its IPO. Delivery Hero priced its shares at the top end of the range on Thursday, meaning the listing is set to raise 996 million euros. Trading is due to start on Friday. Premium to Peers Due to Bigger Footprint The price means that Delivery Hero would trade at an enterprise value of about 10 times expected sales, assuming 50-percent revenue growth and zero net debt, according to Warburg Research analyst Lucas Boventer. That compares to eight times for Just Eat and Takeaway.com, according to Thomson Reuters SmartEstimates.   The premium can be justified. Delivery Hero has a much greater global footprint. They have more sustainable dynamic growth prospects,  said Boventer, pointing to the firm's exposure to emerging markets as helping to drive growth. By contrast, Just Eat operates largely in Britain, Takeaway makes most of its sales in the Netherlands and Germany, while GrubHub focuses on the United States and London. Northern Trust Capital Markets head of tech research, Neil Campling, was more sceptical of Delivery Hero's investment case.   We struggle to see a path to profitability for the business without the turning off the marketing tap which, if occurred, would likely lead to a significant reduction in order and revenue growth,  he said. Chief Executive Niklas Ostberg says Delivery Hero is still loss-making because it is investing in less mature markets and is spending more on marketing and expanding its own delivery unit Foodora, which delivers from high-end restaurants. Concerns about high marketing costs and a lack of profitability also weighed on Wednesday on the BlueApron IPO, compounded by Amazon.com's (AMZN.O) industry-changing deal to buy Whole Foods Market Inc (WFM.O).  A person close to the Delivery Hero IPO stressed the differences, arguing that Blue Apron's subscription-based business model is less attractive than that of Delivery Hero, which generates income by taking a commission on meal orders. Rocket Internet's meal-kit company HelloFresh, which has a similar business model to Blue Apron, is also preparing for a flotation, as early as this autumn if the Delivery Hero listing is successful, sources have told Reuters. Taking Blue Apron's listing valuation of enterprise value at 1.9 times sales, Warburg's Bowenter said HelloFresh could be worth 1.6 billion euros, below the last funding round which valued the company at 2 billion.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-delivery-hero-ipo-idUSKBN19K1HH"},

The annual song fest was hosted in Kiev without a hitch, but the run-up to the competition was marred by Moscow's decision to boycott the event after Ukraine barred its entrant because she had performed in Russia-annexed Crimea.  As a result of this, attention was drawn away from the competition and the brand reputation of the Eurovision Song Contest was endangered,  the EBU said in a statement.  Therefore the contest's steering committee ... has recommended that UA:PBC (Ukraine's state broadcaster) should receive a substantial fine, in line with the rules of the competition,  it said, without saying how much Ukraine would have to pay. UA:PBC Director Zurab Alasania said the fine was 200,000 euros ($228,100) and that the broadcaster would appeal the decision.  Formally, it wasn't us who made the decision not to allow her (Russian singer Yulia Samoylova), but I don't think that the SBU (State Security Service) or the government will want to take part in this,  Alasania told Reuters. Last week, UA:PBC said authorities in Geneva had frozen 15 million euros given by Kiev to the EBU as a guarantee for the successful hosting of Eurovision. It was not immediately clear if this was linked to the EBU's decision to fine Ukraine.  Forty-two countries competed in this year's competition, an annual pageant of the colorful, the camp and the cheesy that in recent years has increasingly been drawn into politics. Ukraine's Jamala won last year with a song about war-time deportations of Crimean Tatars by Soviet dictator Josef Stalin.

The Stuttgart probe is the latest part of a sweeping investigation of Volkswagen Group (VOWG_p.DE), which owns the Audi, VW and Porsche brands. Illegal software has been found in VW, Audi and Porsche cars equipped with diesel engines. Prosecutor Jan Holzner said on Thursday the Porsche probe was not a formal investigation but was rather still at a preliminary stage. Porsche had no immediate comment. Some Porsche models are equipped with 3 liter diesel engines supplied by Audi. Prosecutors in Munich are separately probing Audi about its role in designing the 3 liter diesel engine. Stuttgart prosecutor's office is also formally investigating three employees at automotive supplier Bosch [ROBG.UL] for their possible role in aiding and abetting emissions fraud by Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE), Holzner said.  We are investigating three employees. All three are managers, with the highest ranking being in middle management,  he said, adding he could not rule out that the probe would be widened. Bosch helped to develop an engine control unit, known as EDC17, for Volkswagen's EA189 diesel engine which later failed emissions tests. Bosch said it takes allegations of engine manipulation  very seriously  and is fully cooperating with authorities. Because of the ongoing nature of the investigation Bosch declined to comment on details.

The men have been accused of breaching the colonial-era Unlawful Associations Act after covering an event on Monday where the rebel Ta'ang National Liberation Army (TNLA) burned piles of narcotics to mark International Day Against Drug Abuse.  We don't really think our journalists have working relations with the TNLA group, which (the government) calls terrorists,  said Than Win Htut, planning editor at the Democratic Voice of Burma (DVB), the employer of two of the journalists.  They are just doing a journalist's job.  The TNLA, which demands more autonomy for the Ta'ang ethnic group, regularly clashes with government forces. Broadcaster DVB's Aye Nai and Pyae Phone Naing, and Lawi Weng of the Irrawaddy magazine, were remanded along with three others in Hsipaw prison, in northern Shan State, on Wednesday. They will be brought before a court on July 11, said Thein Zaw, head of the police station handling the case in the town of Hsipaw.  Critics disappointed with Aung San Suu Kyi's first year in power say the case highlights the gaps in Myanmar's transition from military rule to full democracy. Suu Kyi's defenders say the Nobel Peace Prize winner - who spent years under house arrest for opposing Myanmar's junta - is hamstrung by a military-drafted constitution that keeps the generals in politics and free from civilian oversight. Suu Kyi's spokesman has said the journalists should be treated  according to the law . But Phil Robertson, deputy director for New York-based Human Rights Watch's Asia division, said Suu Kyi should use her majority in parliament to rein in the military.  It's hard to tell what Aung San Suu Kyi thinks, but if she believes she can convince the army to somehow reform or moderate their behavior, this is more evidence to show that she's profoundly mistaken,  he said. A Risky Return A reporter works in the Democratic Voice of Burma (DVB) news room in Yangon, Myanmar June 29, 2017.Soe Zeya TunThe case has sparked outrage among the boisterous media that emerged in the commercial hub Yangon after the government lifted pre-publication censorship in 2012. Journalists will gather signatures on Friday calling for the release of the three men - and of an editor charged in a separate case with defamation over a satirical article mocking the army. Both DVB and the Irrawaddy were set up in exile in Thailand, receiving funding from Western governments and NGOs, and have opened bureaus in Yangon since 2012. Aye Nai, 53, and Lawi Weng, 38, returned to Myanmar to cover the conflicts between the army and ethnic rebels. Lawi Weng, a member of southern Myanmar's Mon ethnic minority, is a practicing Buddhist who meditates each morning and night. He had planned to marry this year. Loa Htaw, his fiancée, said Lawi Weng knew the risks his repeated trips to conflict areas entailed.  Both he and I (were) aware that he might face prison if he keeps writing about our ethnic armed groups and criticizes the military and government,  she wrote in a message to Reuters. However,  he needs to report for the voiceless and the powerless , Loa Htaw said. Part of the new generation of Myanmar journalists to emerge since the reforms, 24-year-old Pyae Phone Naing worked for several media organizations before joining DVB about four months ago, his father, Kyaw Soe Oo, told Reuters. On Monday evening, Pyae Phone Naing called his mother. He informed her that he was in a military camp, but not to worry, his father said. The parents did not realize the gravity of the situation until later, when relatives started calling having seen news reports of their son's detention.  It gives me pain in my heart. I always worry about him, even when he comes home late on usual days,  Kyaw Soe Oo told Reuters.  I want my son to be released.

The sports, which include archery, badminton, fencing and weightlifting, have been left without National Lottery and government funding ahead of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.  We've been thrown under a bus,  Adrian Christy, the Badminton England chief executive whose sport came home from last year's Rio de Janeiro Olympics with a bronze medal, told the BBC. The  Every Sport Matters  joint manifesto said the existing approach had reaped plenty of medals but disenfranchised elite athletes with a system that  runs counter to Olympic ideals .  Currently, athletes in sports deprived of Lottery funding will find it almost impossible to qualify for the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics,  it added.  Even athletes with recognized medal potential created by Lottery funding have now been completely abandoned by the system.  UK Sport's focus on medal potential has produced record returns, with Britain second in the Rio Olympic standings with 27 gold medals and 67 in total. In 1996, Britain was 36th in the medals table with just one gold among 15 medals. However there has also been criticism of the win-at-all-cost approach.  There is too much of a culture of medal winners and non-medal winners which is unhealthy and doesn’t speak well for us as a sporting society,  UK Athletics chairman Ed Warner told reporters in May. Thursday's manifesto urged Katherine Grainger, the five times Olympic rowing medalist who takes over as chair of UK Sport next week, to instigate a thorough review.  We urge UK Sport to recognize that medal targets alone should not be the sole criteria for its funding,  it said. Grainger acknowledged the call but indicated there could be no quick fix.  I will of course listen to these sports’ concerns, and UK Sport will go out to consultation again on its investment strategy for the 2024 cycle,  she said in a UK Sport statement.  But as things currently stand, as ever with finite investment, we simply cannot reach the sports who are furthest away from medal success.  UK Sport runs a lean operation ... so to take the approach these sports are suggesting would mean taking away funding or expertise from athletes with greater chances of medal success.

You may not like Martin Shkreli,  Benjamin Brafman said in his opening argument in Brooklyn federal court,  and you may have reasons to hate Martin Shkreli, but that is not a basis on which to convict.  Shkreli's reputation stems largely from his decision to raise the price of anti-parisitic drug Daraprim to $750 a pill, from $13.50 when he was chief executive of Turing Pharmaceuticals in 2015. That move sparked outrage among patients and U.S. lawmakers. But Brafman reminded jurors that Shkreli is  not on trial for all of the other stuff that made him a household name.  Instead, Shkreli, 34, is facing charges over to his tenure as an executive at drug company Retrophin Inc and hedge fund MSMB Capital Management between 2009 and 2012. Before Brafman's opening, Assistant U.S. Attorney Karthik Srinivasan told jurors that Shkreli lied about MSMB's finances to lure investors, concealed devastating losses and repaid them with cash and stock stolen from Retrophin, which he founded in 2011.  They got their money back only because the defendant stole from a public company, and it eventually turned out to be successful,  Srinivasan said. Shkreli was ousted as Retrophin's CEO in 2014. Brafman, in his opening statement, conceded that Shkreli's statements to investors were not always  100 percent accurate.  But he said Shkreli's wealthy investors trusted Shkreli despite knowing about his erratic personality, and were rewarded in the end, reaping millions of dollars in returns.  Martin Shkreli didn’t lie to them,  Brafman said.  They were betting on Martin Shkreli’s genius.  Brafman described Shkreli as a socially awkward  nerd  exploited by people around him, a sharp contrast with the villainous  pharma bro  persona depicted throughout media. The lawyer told jurors that Retrophin board members bullied Shkreli, suggesting he was autistic, questioning his sexuality and eventually forced him out because they were embarrassed by him.  Martin Shkreli came to work in t-shirts and sneakers and wore a stethoscope and bunny slippers and they couldn't handle it,  Brafman said.  You want to call him names, you can call him names,  he said.  Just don’t call him guilty, because he’s not guilty.

The Stuttgart probe is the latest part of a sweeping investigation of Volkswagen Group (VOWG_p.DE), which owns the Audi, VW and Porsche brands. Illegal software has been found in VW, Audi and Porsche cars equipped with diesel engines. Prosecutor Jan Holzner said on Thursday the Porsche probe was not a formal investigation but was rather still at a preliminary stage. Porsche had no immediate comment. Some Porsche models are equipped with 3 liter diesel engines supplied by Audi. Prosecutors in Munich are separately probing Audi about its role in designing the 3 liter diesel engine. Stuttgart prosecutor's office is also formally investigating three employees at automotive supplier Bosch [ROBG.UL] for their possible role in aiding and abetting emissions fraud by Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE), Holzner said.  We are investigating three employees. All three are managers, with the highest ranking being in middle management,  he said, adding he could not rule out that the probe would be widened. Bosch helped to develop an engine control unit, known as EDC17, for Volkswagen's EA189 diesel engine which later failed emissions tests. Bosch said it takes allegations of engine manipulation  very seriously  and is fully cooperating with authorities. Because of the ongoing nature of the investigation Bosch declined to comment on details.

Nornickel, the world's second-largest nickel producer and a major cobalt producer, and German chemicals company BASF said on Tuesday they were in talks to supply nickel and cobalt, needed to make lithium-ion batteries, in Europe, as the car industry's push into electric vehicles gathers pace. For Nornickel, this is just the start.  We are discussing...transactions with several manufacturers in the industry,  Nornickel's Markus Meurer said in an interview with Reuters. Nornickel and BASF's talks cover cooperation to set the foundation to supply battery cell producers for electric vehicles in Europe with regionally produced cathode materials, they said on Tuesday.  Meurer said the project with BASF would be developed over the next few months and that it was too early to say how much metal and in which form it would be supplied.  Timing will depend a lot on market development and on technology....The important question is how to enable the ramp-up of production of battery raw materials in parallel with increasing demand,  Meurer said. The number of electric vehicles on roads worldwide rose to a record high of 2 million last year, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said this month, as governments clamp down on fossil fuels such as gasoline and diesel. UBS recently raised its forecasts for global sales of electric vehicles in 2021 to 3.1 million from 2.5 million and to 14.2 million by 2025 from 9.7 million. It expects electric vehicles to account for 3.1 percent of global car sales in 2021 and 13.7 percent in 2025, against 1 percent this year. Last year, nickel demand for electric vehicle batteries rose 20 percent to 15,000 tonnes, according to Nornickel.  Meurer said he expected demand for nickel from the electric vehicle market to rise to 300,000 tonnes in 10 years from 20,000 tonnes in 2017, making it the second-largest segment for nickel demand after stainless steel. Global demand for cobalt, a by-product of nickel and copper, last year was about 100,000 tonnes, of which roughly half was used in batteries to power electric cars. Nornickel produces about 5,000 tonnes of cobalt a year. Prices for cobalt metal have nearly tripled to nine-year peaks above $27 a lb from below $10 a lb in Dec 2015.

The issues will be debated at the WTO's Council on the Trade in Goods, where the WTO's 164 members can weigh in on major areas of trade friction. Airing such concerns is not a complaint in itself, but often signals that a legal dispute is on the way. The draft agenda gave no details of what would be said. The row in the Gulf erupted this month when Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt broke off ties with Qatar, accusing it of supporting terrorism and being an ally of regional foe Iran. The row has not yet been raised at the WTO, where Qatar and its allies in the Gulf Cooperation Council, which includes Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the UAE, have appeared to work together as usual. In the WTO agenda, Qatar merely said it wanted to discuss  trade restrictive measures by certain members . The Russian item was more specific, entitled  Section 232 investigations on the effect of imports of steel and aluminium products on U.S. National Security . The rarely-used section 232 of the U.S. Trade Expansion Act of 1962 allows the president to impose restrictions on imports for reasons of national security. The Trump administration's plan to use it has caused a storm of controversy among trade diplomats, who see invoking the WTO's  national security exemption  as a last resort that could damage the global trading system. U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross said earlier this month that the Trump administration expects U.S. and World Trade Organization-related legal challenges in response to a possible crackdown on foreign imports of steel or aluminium. Other items on the WTO agenda include China and the United States both wanting to discuss  trade distorting measures  by the other, with no details provided.

Delivery Hero will become the fourth major online food delivery firm to go public in recent years, following GrubHub (GRUB.N), Just Eat (JE.L) and Takeaway.com (TKWY.AS), which have all seen their share price soar since listing. Delivery Hero is on course to trade at a premium to its peers and while some analysts say this is justified by its bigger global footprint, others are concerned that it is still making heavy losses. GrubHub and Just East are both profitable. Consultants McKinsey estimate the global food takeaway market is worth 83 billion euros, growing at just 3.5 percent a year. However, online apps are rapidly taking over from called-in orders, with McKinsey predicting they will account for 58 percent of the total market by 2020, from 36 percent in 2016. Founded in Berlin in 2011, Delivery Hero is riding that wave and now employs more than 6,000 people, providing a digital platform to order meals from more than 150,000 restaurants in 40 countries in Europe, the Middle East, Latin America and Asia. The listing should provide a boost to struggling German ecommerce investor Rocket Internet, which holds a 35-percent stake in Delivery Hero, although its shares came under pressure on Wednesday after U.S. meal-kit provider Blue Apron Holdings Inc (APRN.N) raised a third less than it had hoped in its IPO. Delivery Hero priced its shares at the top end of the range on Thursday, meaning the listing is set to raise 996 million euros. Trading is due to start on Friday. Premium to Peers Due to Bigger Footprint The price means that Delivery Hero would trade at an enterprise value of about 10 times expected sales, assuming 50-percent revenue growth and zero net debt, according to Warburg Research analyst Lucas Boventer. That compares to eight times for Just Eat and Takeaway.com, according to Thomson Reuters SmartEstimates.   The premium can be justified. Delivery Hero has a much greater global footprint. They have more sustainable dynamic growth prospects,  said Boventer, pointing to the firm's exposure to emerging markets as helping to drive growth. By contrast, Just Eat operates largely in Britain, Takeaway makes most of its sales in the Netherlands and Germany, while GrubHub focuses on the United States and London. Northern Trust Capital Markets head of tech research, Neil Campling, was more sceptical of Delivery Hero's investment case.   We struggle to see a path to profitability for the business without the turning off the marketing tap which, if occurred, would likely lead to a significant reduction in order and revenue growth,  he said. Chief Executive Niklas Ostberg says Delivery Hero is still loss-making because it is investing in less mature markets and is spending more on marketing and expanding its own delivery unit Foodora, which delivers from high-end restaurants. Concerns about high marketing costs and a lack of profitability also weighed on Wednesday on the BlueApron IPO, compounded by Amazon.com's (AMZN.O) industry-changing deal to buy Whole Foods Market Inc (WFM.O).  A person close to the Delivery Hero IPO stressed the differences, arguing that Blue Apron's subscription-based business model is less attractive than that of Delivery Hero, which generates income by taking a commission on meal orders. Rocket Internet's meal-kit company HelloFresh, which has a similar business model to Blue Apron, is also preparing for a flotation, as early as this autumn if the Delivery Hero listing is successful, sources have told Reuters. Taking Blue Apron's listing valuation of enterprise value at 1.9 times sales, Warburg's Bowenter said HelloFresh could be worth 1.6 billion euros, below the last funding round which valued the company at 2 billion.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/delivery-hero-ipo-idUSL8N1JQ2GS"},

Morgan Stanley was up 2.7 percent, Citigroup Inc 2.6 percent, Bank of America Corp 2.4 percent, JPMorgan Chase & Co 2 percent, Wells Fargo & Co 1.7 percent and Goldman Sachs Group Inc 1.3 percent. The Fed said on Wednesday that all of the 34 banks had passed the second, tougher part of its annual stress test, showing that many have not only built up adequate capital buffers, but improved risk management procedures as well. The verdict marks a significant victory for the banking industry, which has worked for years to regain its stature. Altogether, banks that went through the tests will be able to pay out 100 percent of their projected net income over the next four quarters, compared with 65 percent after last year's results, a senior Fed official said. It would be the first time since the 2008 financial crisis that banks return at least as much money to shareholders as they produce in annual profit. Except Goldman Sachs, all other big U.S. banks announced share buyback programs and raised dividends.

In a report on broader migration trends, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development said that the biggest exodus of asylum-seekers was from war-ravaged Syria, followed by Afghanistan and Iraq. Asylum request numbers continued to drop in the early months of this year, it added. For a fourth straight year, Germany registered by far the  largest number of asylum applications - 48 percent of a world total of 1.64 million in 2016.  The United States, where the bulk of asylum applications are from Latin Americans, was a distant second, registering 262,000 asylum applications. The total number of applications dropped by one percent from 2015, said the Paris-based OECD, which noted that many of those who arrived in Germany in 2015 filed formal asylum applications in 2016. When compared to the population of the host country, Germany registered more than 10 times as many asylum requests as the United States and four times as many as Italy, another key destination for many migrants, notably from Nigeria. The OECD, a think-tank funded by the governments of its 35  member countries, most of them wealthy economies and relatively stable politically, suggested the slight dip in asylum requests in 2016 may be followed by a more pronounced reduction this year. In the first six months of 2017, the total number of landings on European shores reached 85,000, around 10 times less than at the peak in the second half of 2015, it said in a statement that accompanied its report. With two in three refugees arriving in Europe, OECD chief Angel Gurria said:  Improving the integration of immigrants and their children, including refugees, is vital to delivering a more prosperous, inclusive future for all.  While OECD countries, primarily in Western Europe, received 1.6 million asylum requests in 2016, Turkey alone was providing temporary protection to another three million Syrians, the organization said.

The study interviewed tens of prostitutes servicing the busy west Indian city of Pune, a major IT and auto hub that draws skilled workers from across the country. It found the women were well aware of the risks they faced from sexually transmitted diseases but had no knowledge of their own children's health needs. Many of their infants were malnourished and lacked the most basic of immunizations.  These women do not have the courage to go to the government hospital fearing stigma,  Mrunmayee Mangale, who conducted the research, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation late on Thursday. According to government data, there are more than 200 brothels in Pune, the second largest city after Mumbai in the state of Maharashtra, which is among the biggest destinations for trafficked women in the country.  All the sex workers I interviewed were aware of HIV/AIDS, the use of condoms and their vulnerability to other sexually transmitted diseases,  said Mangale, a medicine student at Pune's Byramjee Jeejeebhoy Government Medical College.  So they are taught about their health, but the children's health is ignored,  Mangale added. Campaigns aimed at prostitutes often concentrate on sexual health, rather than reproductive or child health, leaving mother and child vulnerable to serious medical problems. Oxford of the East Pune is located about 150 kms from Mumbai and is one of the fastest-growing cities in the Asia-Pacific region.  It plays host to major technology and auto firms, and is dubbed  Oxford of the East  for its many seats of education. The sex workers, by contrast to their clients, are often poor, rural and unschooled.  Mangale mapped 50 mothers aged 15-30, half of whom were from outside Maharashtra, and most of whom were illiterate. Mangale found many delivered their babies inside their place of work - the brothel - often aided only by untrained midwives. Nearly 22 percent of their children were found to be malnourished, and their mothers displayed poor knowledge of nutrition and the most common childhood illnesses.  Most mothers knew the importance of breastfeeding their babies, but didn't know for how long, the study found. Mangale's project has earned her a spot to discuss healthcare in conflicts at the Asia Pacific Regional Meeting at Tokyo in September. Campaigners say many children are cared for by charities in red-light areas, but as the sex trade shifts to private lodges and hotels, it is more difficult to monitor their health.

The study interviewed tens of prostitutes servicing the busy west Indian city of Pune, a major IT and auto hub that draws skilled workers from across the country. It found the women were well aware of the risks they faced from sexually transmitted diseases but had no knowledge of their own children's health needs. Many of their infants were malnourished and lacked the most basic of immunizations.  These women do not have the courage to go to the government hospital fearing stigma,  Mrunmayee Mangale, who conducted the research, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation late on Thursday. According to government data, there are more than 200 brothels in Pune, the second largest city after Mumbai in the state of Maharashtra, which is among the biggest destinations for trafficked women in the country.  All the sex workers I interviewed were aware of HIV/AIDS, the use of condoms and their vulnerability to other sexually transmitted diseases,  said Mangale, a medicine student at Pune's Byramjee Jeejeebhoy Government Medical College.  So they are taught about their health, but the children's health is ignored,  Mangale added. Campaigns aimed at prostitutes often concentrate on sexual health, rather than reproductive or child health, leaving mother and child vulnerable to serious medical problems. Oxford of the East Pune is located about 150 kms from Mumbai and is one of the fastest-growing cities in the Asia-Pacific region.  It plays host to major technology and auto firms, and is dubbed  Oxford of the East  for its many seats of education. The sex workers, by contrast to their clients, are often poor, rural and unschooled.  Mangale mapped 50 mothers aged 15-30, half of whom were from outside Maharashtra, and most of whom were illiterate. Mangale found many delivered their babies inside their place of work - the brothel - often aided only by untrained midwives. Nearly 22 percent of their children were found to be malnourished, and their mothers displayed poor knowledge of nutrition and the most common childhood illnesses.  Most mothers knew the importance of breastfeeding their babies, but didn't know for how long, the study found. Mangale's project has earned her a spot to discuss healthcare in conflicts at the Asia Pacific Regional Meeting at Tokyo in September. Campaigners say many children are cared for by charities in red-light areas, but as the sex trade shifts to private lodges and hotels, it is more difficult to monitor their health.

Congo's independence day parades, held each of the last three years, are usually festive events that mark the end of Belgian colonial rule in 1960 and have been used to show off the Central African country's latest arms acquisitions. But rising militia violence, a growing humanitarian crisis and a spate of prison breaks have unsettled Africa's largest copper producer in recent months, adding to an already tense political climate. Kabila refused to step down at the end of his mandate in December, increasing instability and raising fears of a backslide to the civil wars of the turn of the century that killed millions. Kabila's deputy chief of staff, Jean-Pierre Kambila, told Reuters there would be no military parade on June 30  for security reasons , but did not elaborate. He said Kabila would likely still give a televised speech. The parade was also cancelled in 2012 and 2013 during the country's war with the M23 rebellion. Thousands of inmates have escaped from jails this year, including about 4,000 from the capital Kinshasa's main high-security prison last month. In response, police and army have set up night-time checkpoints in Kinshasa's business district of Gombe. Meanwhile, fighting between government forces and a local militia in the central Kasai region has killed more than 3,300 people and forced 1.3 million to flee their homes since August. Opponents accuse Kabila, in power since 2001, of deliberately delaying the next presidential election in order to cling to power, but the government says the delays are due to a slow voter registration process and financing shortfalls.

The sports, which include archery, badminton, fencing and weightlifting, have been left without National Lottery and government funding ahead of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.  We've been thrown under a bus,  Adrian Christy, the Badminton England chief executive whose sport came home from last year's Rio de Janeiro Olympics with a bronze medal, told the BBC. The  Every Sport Matters  joint manifesto said the existing approach had reaped plenty of medals but disenfranchised elite athletes with a system that  runs counter to Olympic ideals .  Currently, athletes in sports deprived of Lottery funding will find it almost impossible to qualify for the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics,  it added.  Even athletes with recognized medal potential created by Lottery funding have now been completely abandoned by the system.  UK Sport's focus on medal potential has produced record returns, with Britain second in the Rio Olympic standings with 27 gold medals and 67 in total. In 1996, Britain was 36th in the medals table with just one gold among 15 medals. However there has also been criticism of the win-at-all-cost approach.  There is too much of a culture of medal winners and non-medal winners which is unhealthy and doesn’t speak well for us as a sporting society,  UK Athletics chairman Ed Warner told reporters in May. Thursday's manifesto urged Katherine Grainger, the five times Olympic rowing medalist who takes over as chair of UK Sport next week, to instigate a thorough review.  We urge UK Sport to recognize that medal targets alone should not be the sole criteria for its funding,  it said. Grainger acknowledged the call but indicated there could be no quick fix.  I will of course listen to these sports’ concerns, and UK Sport will go out to consultation again on its investment strategy for the 2024 cycle,  she said in a UK Sport statement.  But as things currently stand, as ever with finite investment, we simply cannot reach the sports who are furthest away from medal success.  UK Sport runs a lean operation ... so to take the approach these sports are suggesting would mean taking away funding or expertise from athletes with greater chances of medal success.

By Jamie McGeever LONDON, June 29 (Reuters) - As far as financial markets are concerned, especially equities, the first half of the year has witnessed the curious phenomenon of reflation without the inflation. Markets continue to defy gravity thanks to nearly a decade of unprecedented central bank stimulus, but economic recovery and record low unemployment across the developed world have failed to ignite traditional consumer price inflation. The lack of earnings growth is central to this phenomenon. Yet again, wages is the dog that didn't bark in the first half of the year and there's little to suggest it will bare its teeth in the second half. A decade on from the onset of the crisis, however, the world's top central banks are suddenly speaking with one voice, telling markets that record low interest rates and crisis-fighting stimulus measures will soon be unwound. But if anything is going to give them pause for thought - and keep the global market rally going - it's subdued wage growth. There may be good reasons for tighter policy, but inflation isn't one of them. Inflationary pressures are easing even though unemployment is falling, a combination that is at odds with history and conventional economic theory. The Phillips Curve suggests wages should rise as the labour market tightens, but the euro zone Philips curve has been largely flat since 2011. The Bank of England aside, central banks are failing to meet their inflation targets. The Fed recently cut its inflation forecast to 1.7 percent this year from 1.9 percent, and the European Central Bank sees inflation at only 1.6 percent out to 2019. Wage growth across the developed world is weak. It's only 2.5 percent in the United States and 2.1 percent in Britain. Thanks to the rise in UK inflation following the Brexit-driven plunge in sterling, real wages in Britain are falling. There are many reasons for this: rapid advances in technology, automation, globalisation, falling trade union membership, demographic changes and fragmented labour markets thanks to more part-time, freelance and temporary work. The growing consensus among central bankers now appears to be that monetary policy is powerless to influence any of that, so why persist with super-accomodative policy that will likely fail to achieve their goals and potentially create a host of problems down the road? Under Pressure Much to policymakers' relief, the snails' pace of wage growth post-2009 has been offset by the rise in household wealth thanks to booming financial markets and higher house prices. In the United States, household net wealth has soared by $40 trillion since the beginning of the expansion in 2009 to $95 trillion from $55 trillion. It is up $11 trillion in just the last two years. So while wages may be stagnant, healthier household balance sheets should provide continued support for growth and stocks, particularly if the global tightening trend being laid out by central bankers comes to pass. But market watchers can be forgiven for retaining a healthy dose of skepticism around central banks' intentions. They've been here several times before in the last 10 years, and each time they have erred on the side of caution. According to economists at HSBC, the absence of wage pressures means the ECB will only scale back its asset purchases  gradually  throughout next year and the Fed will raise rates only once next year compared to the Fed's indicated three hikes. Euro zone inflation won't reach 2 percent without a  meaningful  pick up in wage growth, particularly in Germany, they reckon. Analysts at Rabobank agree. The ECB may be forced to begin unwinding its asset purchase program because of  technical factors  but the slow recovery in wages and core inflation means there will be no rate hike next year.

In shorts and sandals, he lights a blow torch, training a blue flame on a piece of ore which his barge dredged up from the bottom of the Madeira River in Brazil's northwestern Rondonia state, on the border with Bolivia.  Hundreds of similar barges - fashioned from plywood and metal and powered by roaring diesel motors - troll the rivers of the world's largest rainforest leaving trails of destruction in their wake, according to government officials.   I know this is a bit dangerous, but what else am I going to do to make a living here?  said the miner, who spoke on the condition of anonymity due to his involvement in illegal activity. When asked about safety equipment he just laughed.  Tens of thousands of illegal miners - or  garimpeiros  as they are known - have poured into the Amazon rainforest in Brazil, Peru, Bolivia, Venezuela and Colombia looking to strike it rich.  The gold rush has decimated the forest in parts of Amazon,  while poisoning people who depend on the rivers for their food with mercury and other toxins used in the extraction process.  The illicit industry is fueled by the trafficking of men to extract the gold and women to work as prostitutes servicing miners, according to Brazilian prosecutors.  Big, Dirty Business With billions of dollars at stake and complex criminal networks laundering illegally-mined gold across borders, officials admit they are struggling to contain the problem.   We have immense difficulties,  Ranilson Monteiro Camara from Brazil's Ministry of Mining told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in Porto Velho, Rondonia's gritty state capital.  Dozens of boats with no legal registration openly haul gold out of the river just two kilometers from his office. Camara said he is the department's only official in Rondonia State responsible for monitoring the garimpeiros and their billion dollar industry.   Levels of irregular (mining) activity on the river are high,  Camara said. Inspectors and other officials are working to try shutter illegal boats, while formally registering others so they can operate legally, he said.  It's no easy task. In a given year, illegal miners ship 40 tons of gold extracted from across the Amazon into the United States, according to a 2016 study by Verite, a Massachusetts-based watchdog. This is nearly twice the legal gold exports from the five Amazonian nations covered by the study.      Between 2006 and 2016, 68 tons of gold were illegally extracted from the Amazon and smuggled out of the region through Bolivia, according to the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime.  Illegal miners dump more than 30 tons of deadly mercury into Amazon Rivers each year, poisoning fish and causing brain damage to people living hundreds of kilometers (miles) downstream, according to the Carnegie Amazon Mercury Project, a U.S.-based scientific group.  Attempts at Regulation    Gold producers, for their part, say they are unfairly stigmatized as bandits despite many working within the law.    We are seen as bad by society, but actually we work, pay tax and support the local economy,  said Fabiano Sena Oliveira, a senior member of a gold producers' cooperative in Rondonia. Only 20 percent of the miners operate illegally, Oliveira told the Thomson Reuters Foundation from a storefront with barred windows where he buys and sells gold.  A gold mining boat sits in the Madeira River in Rondonia state, Brazil on June 4, 2017. Thomson Reuters Foundation/Chris ArsenaultCooperatives of mining boat owners are working to improve their environmental monitoring, and to make sure people register with authorities and pay their taxes, said Oliveira, a huge man wearing a gold chain and Ralph Lauren polo shirt.  In the past it's true miners used a lot of mercury,  he said, but today they use far less as it is expensive.  As part of the mining process mercury is mixed with rocks dredged from the bottom of the river. The mixture of mercury and sediment is then heated up, helping to separate the gold. But visits to garimpeiro boats by the Thomson Reuters Foundation appeared to contradict his remarks about miners moving away from mercury use. Life on the Boats     Sidney Magrao has spent the past 35 years as a garimpeiro. He works on a large mining boat with a powerful tube which sucks sediment from the bottom of the Madeira River. Miners on the boat then sift through the rocks and dirt for tiny pieces of gold.  Magrao started off in the business wading into small rivers with a hand-held tube and is now a senior operator on a boat worth 3 million reais ($900,000).  Slideshow (7 Images) I earned 23,000 reais last month ($7,000),  a huge salary for a working-class man in the Amazon, 62-year-old Magrao told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. He spoke while maneuvering levers to direct the boat's suction tube with a cigarette dangling in his mouth. The two story-barge with humming motors looks like something out of a science fiction movie like Mad Max or Water World. It has several sleeping rooms with bunk beds and a fulltime cook. Workers say it is formally registered with Brazilian authorities, meaning they have to pay tax on their earnings.    We are paid in gold,  said 60-year-old Valda Mendes, the boat's cook, as she prepared a lunch of rice and steak on open flames.   Laundering Profits       While some boats obey the law, much of the Amazon's gold is extracted from jungle land where mining is prohibited, said a local professor who studies the illicit trade.  In other cases gold is taken from lands or waters where mining is permitted but then smuggled from Brazil into Bolivia to avoid taxes, said Aurelio Herraiz from the Federal Institute of Education, Science and Technology of Amazonas State.   Many buyers go on boats to buy gold... This is invisible,  Herraiz told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  There is no record of it anywhere.  Mercury contamination is one of the biggest environmental threats from the trade, Herraiz said, and the toxic chemical is cheap and easy to obtain in neighboring Bolivia.   Police officials say tracking the movement of illicit gold and chemicals between different Amazon countries is difficult.   Like all frontiers, there are problems and issues here to be solved,  said Heliel Martins, a police chief in Rondonia. Back on the illegal mining boat, the 22-year-old worker opens a plastic bottle of mercury before pouring it onto a nugget of gold.  The boat's captain started as a cook in the industry 18 years ago, saved her money and then bought the vessel.   It's bureaucratic and expensive to get registered,  she said, adding that she had been fined heavily for operating illegally. To pay the fines for breaking the rules, she had just one source of revenue - gold.   Travel support for this reporting was provided by the Society of Environmental Journalists (SEJ).

These banks have among the worst NPL/gross loans ratios in Europe. In March 2017, the ECB issued guidance requiring banks with high NPLs to devise strategies to reduce them, including work-out, servicing and portfolio sales. The regulator will then be able monitor adherence to strategy and take appropriate action. NPL ratios are highest at the largest Greek and Cypriot banks while Italy had 12 banks with end-2016 ratios of more than twice the 5.1% weighted average reported by the European Banking Authority. In Italy, problem loans have built up during a long recessionary period and it is only recently that the economy has started to give banks breathing space to start to tackle this legacy. If large NPL securitisations planned by UniCredit, supported by its recent capital increase, and by Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena as part of its precautionary recapitalisation, are launched successfully in the next month or so, we expect to see other banks taking the securitisation route to reduce NPL stock. But large NPL sales and securitisations are difficult to achieve and none of the large announced transactions has yet been closed. The contrasting treatment of Banco Popular Espanol, which was put into resolution, and Veneto Banca and Banca Popolare di Vicenza, which were liquidated, raises questions about the application of the EU's Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD). The BRRD is intended to shield taxpayers from the costs of bank failures by forcing banks' creditors to bear costs. However, Italy's decision to transfer senior bondholders to Intesa Sanpaolo along with the two Veneto banks' performing assets and only keep subordinated debt and equity, along with NPLs, in Veneto Banca and Banca Popolare di Vicenza, shields senior bondholders from losses, while the Italian state is paying EUR5.2 billion in cash and providing up to EUR12 billion in guarantees to Intesa Sanpaolo. The decision was driven by Italy's reluctance for the banks' senior debt to be bailed in, given partly that many retail investors hold this debt, but also that it ranks pari passu with other senior obligations, so would be difficult to segregate for bail-in without endangering the smooth functioning of critical financial services carried out by the banks. Senior bondholders would have been vulnerable to losses had the banks been put into resolution, given their thin junior debt buffers. We believe the treatment of troubled banks will be clearer once the EU's minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL) is in place. MREL, combined with a likely EU-wide new class of non-preferred senior debt, will provide loss-absorbing debt eligible for bail-in that shields preferred senior obligations from losses triggered by resolution. This should substantially reduce the need to use state resources. MREL is due to be implemented by 2022, with insolvency regimes across Europe being updated in the meantime to enable banks to issue non-preferred senior debt. This month the Council of the EU agreed its stance on a package of proposals aimed at reducing risk in the banking industry, including a draft directive requiring member states to create a new class of non-preferred senior debt, eligible to meet the subordination requirement in an insolvency. This should facilitate the cross-border application of bail-in rules. Fitch's  EMEA Banks: Chart of the Month - June 2017  is available at www.fitchratings.com or by clicking the link above.

Trump,Lance Dutson,Paul LePage,Phil Bartlett,Susan Collins,US,USA,POLITICS,MAINE,General News,Pictures,Government / Politics,United States,Maine","sector":"Politics","content":"(Reuters) - Maine's two most prominent Republicans grabbed headlines this week with political moves that were widely different in style and substance, which some insiders said could risk the party's stature in the northeastern state. U.S. Senator Susan Collins won praise from Democrats for saying she would not vote for a White House-backed healthcare reform bill while Governor Paul LePage revved up his conservative base by saying he was ready for a state government shutdown if legislators did not agree with his calls for budget cuts. The move by Collins, a four-term moderate, was in keeping with Maine's reputation for producing independent-minded legislators willing to buck their party's leadership in Washington. That tradition was challenged by LePage, who first ran for office in 2010 on a wave of populist Tea Party support and won two three-way races with less than a majority of the vote.  What you see is a battle for the heart and soul of the Republican party in Maine,  said David Farmer, a Democratic political consultant who worked on the 2014 campaign of LePage's Democratic challenger.  Is it going to be the belligerent, angry Governor LePage or is it going to be the thorough and pragmatic but still conservative Senator Collins?  Republican lobbyist and political operative Lance Dutson largely agreed.  It's an ideological tipping point,  said Dutson, who worked on Collins' 2014 reelection campaign, which she won with 68 percent of the vote. Maine has a tradition of successful third-party candidates, notably independent U.S. Senator Angus King, and has more unaffiliated voters than those registered as either Democrats or Republicans.  In the long run, the Collins model has proven itself,  Dutson said.  You can't be an orthodox Republican and talk only to Republicans like LePage and win as much support.  Collins and LePage have publicly disagreed over President Donald Trump, whose brusque style and populist approach is similar to the Maine governor's. LePage was an early supporter of Trump's White House campaign. When Collins said last year that she would not vote for the New York real estate developer, LePage told local media he was  not a Susan Collins fan.

We're an inclusive party, we have strong conservatives, libertarians and we have our moderates, but we're a party, we're a party of reform and we are going to stick together,  said Demi Kouzounas, a dentist who was elected as the party chair in January.  We support both of them strongly.  Style and Substance The gap between the two was as clear in the style of their comments as it was in its substance. Collins said she had  serious concerns  about the Senate bill backed by Trump as a replacement to the Affordable Healthcare Act, known as Obamacare. After the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the measure would cause 22 million Americans to lose their healthcare insurance over the next decade, Collins became one of a handful of Senate Republicans to say they could not support the bill in its current form, leading to Tuesday's decision to delay the vote. Also on Tuesday, LePage told a radio interviewer that he was ready to shut down the state government ahead of a holiday weekend that is crucial for businesses catering to tourists, if Democratic lawmakers would not agree to $145 million in spending cuts in the state's next two-year budget of roughly $7 billion.  I'm the worst guy in the world to play chicken with, because I don't veer either way,  LePage told WMOV radio.  If there's a collision to be had, it's coming.  The Democrats and Republicans blame each other for the state's budget impasse, which is focused on a debate over how to fund the public schools. A government shutdown could further expose Republican rifts and turn more moderate Republicans against LePage's tactics, suggested Phil Bartlett, a former state senator who now serves as chairman of the Maine Democratic party.  He's been saved by the fact that cooler minds have prevailed to prevent the worst of his impulses,  Bartlett said.  But we're now seeing that he and the House Republicans seem to be willing to shut down the government.

But we would do well to think about it now, as the Senate Republicans take a holiday weekend pause in their push to dismantle the Affordable Care Act. Roughly half of Americans now turning 65 will require some level of long-term care during retirement. And when professional care is required, it usually is paid for by Medicaid, which covers 62 percent of long-term care in the United States, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF). That may surprise people who think of Medicaid as a social safety net for the poor. Indeed, the program is a critical lifeline for 35 million children and 27 million adults in low-income households. But nursing home care is expensive, and 62 percent of near-retirement households have saved less than one year of annual income for retirement, according to the National Institute on Retirement Security. When savings run out, Medicaid steps in - nearly two-thirds of its spending in 2014 went to the elderly and disabled, according to KFF. “Medicaid has been a critical safety net for 50 years for people who have depleted their life savings,” said  Jean Accius, vice president of the AARP Public Policy Institute. “It is insurance for your mother or your father or eventually for yourself, because the price can be so high.” The current national system of financing long-term care is a mess. Few households purchase commercial long-term care policies, and the market has experienced upheaval in recent years as underwriters stopped writing new policies or boosted premiums by double-digit rates. Yet the Senate bill would take our already-dysfunctional system of long-term care and make it worse - much worse. The Better Care Reconciliation Act (BCRA) proposes to reduce expected Medicaid outlays by $772 billion over 10 years. That would destabilize access not only to nursing home care but home and community-based services - an innovative approach to care that saves money, and has grown quickly in recent years.  Medicaid is administered by states, but funded jointly with the federal government. Currently, the federal contribution is open-ended. Under BCRA, starting in 2020 states could opt for a federal contribution subject to a per-enrollee cap or in the form of a block grant. The contribution would be based on the current amount sent to a state, and then adjusted annually for inflation. Funding Will Shrink Proponents of BCRA argue this will not squeeze the states because the inflation adjustment will be tied to the federal measure of medical inflation (CPI-M). But as this Medicaid population ages into their 80s and 90s, their care needs will intensify and become much more expensive on a per-capita basis. And after 2025, the inflation measure would shift to a more general inflation gauge that rises much more slowly than healthcare costs. Finally, per-enrollee caps will not adjust for unanticipated major new spending needs - for instance, a major new blockbuster drug or the need to deal with a public health emergency. As federal funding falls behind, states would be left to raise taxes to meet the shortfalls, cut their budgets elsewhere or provide less Medicaid coverage. Cuts could be made first within home and community-based care, because these are optional programs under federal law, while nursing home coverage is mandatory. But nursing home coverage would suffer too, said  Jessica Schubel, senior policy analyst at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.   States may be forced to cut provider rates - which already aren’t very high,” she said. “The providers will then be forced to do more with less - they may cut staff, make fewer beds available to Medicaid patients, or close altogether.  Overall, the BCRA would increase the number of uninsured Americans by 22 million in 2026, according to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). The increase in the number of uninsured would be disproportionately large among people aged 55-64 and with income less than 200 percent of the federal poverty line. Enrollment in Medicaid would fall by 15 million by 2026.  In the insurance exchanges, premiums for older people would soar to unaffordable levels, CBO found. For example, the net premium (after tax credits) for a 64-year-old with income of $56,800 would skyrocket from $6,800 to $20,500. Taking away insurance will kill people - literally. A new study published in Annals of Medicine (bit.ly/2ua8ecp) documents how the lack of health insurance increases mortality; its math suggests that taking insurance away from 22 million people will result in 29,000 avoidable deaths annually. At the same time, the tax cuts in BCRA would reduce federal revenue by $700 billion -  with 45 percent of that going to households making $875,000 or more, according to the Tax Policy Center. The bill repeals the Affordable Care Act’s 3.8 percent net investment income tax on dividends, interest and capital gains, and the 0.9 percent Medicare payroll tax surcharge. The trade-offs in BCRA - insurance for tax cuts for the wealthy - are nothing short of appalling. Governor John Kasich of Ohio put it well while speaking out against the BCRA in Washington this week: “That’s good public policy? What, are you kidding me?” (The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.)  Editing by Matthew Lewis","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/column-miller-healthcare-idUSL1N1JP0WQ"},

However, the agreement has yet to be fully implemented and Mali is struggling to contain militant movements in the north of the country, where rival militias frequently clash and Islamist groups carry out attacks on civilians, Malian soldiers, U.N. peacekeepers and French forces there.

The drop in gasoline shipments to the densely populated U.S. East Coast is forcing European exporters to turn to less steady buyers in West Africa and compete with refineries elsewhere in the United States to export to Latin America and Asia. Deliveries to the U.S. Atlantic Coast from Northwest Europe this month are set to fall 35 percent compared with the 400,000 barrels per day (bpd) that sailed on the route in June 2016, according to U.S.-based ship-tracking firm ClipperData. May imports, at 246,000 bpd, were down nearly 20 percent versus year-earlier levels.  Fears of a replay of last year's gasoline glut are deterring U.S. importers,  said Matt Smith, director of commodity research at ClipperData.  This trend looks set to continue, at least through early July, leaving higher volumes of gasoline to remain within Northwest Europe, as well as ticking higher to Asia.  Starting in 2015, U.S. gasoline demand grew substantially, clocking in 260,000 bpd higher that year and expanding by another 130,000 bpd last year, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. But demand was down 2.7 percent in the first quarter of this year, and the four-week average was also lower year-on-year despite hitting all-time highs in two of the past five weeks. In another sign of the slowdown, three oil tankers, the Atlantic Pegasus, the Ardmore Seavantage and the CPO China, are ballasting - or sailing with no product inside them - from Europe to the United States. Tankers often sail empty from one market to another when freight rates in the destination are strong, but it is highly unusual for the United States not to need European gasoline over the peak-demand summer months.  It just doesn't make sense to ship,  one trader said of the gasoline arbitrage to the United States. Europe can also send those barrels to other regions, including West Africa, which took some 286,000 bpd from Europe in 2016, according to industry research group Wood Mackenzie, and Latin America, where refinery shutdowns have boosted the need for imports. But U.S. refineries have been churning out, and exporting, record volumes of fuel this year. This has kept U.S. gasoline inventories near the top of the five-year average, pressed demand to ship gasoline on a key route within the country to a six-year low - and made plenty available to export to Latin America.  Demand from Latin America is going to hold up - and that will bode well for U.S. refiners,  said Steve Sawyer, head of refining with consultancy FGE.  European refineries are the world's marginal producers. If U.S. gasoline demand isn't as strong as we think it is, European refineries will feel the pain first.

In a defiant speech to parliament a week before she will host a summit of the world's top economic powers in Hamburg, the northern port city where she was born, Merkel did not mention Trump by name but said global problems could not be solved with protectionism and isolation. Her remarks raised the prospect of an open clash with Trump at the summit. She later met with European G20 leaders who promised to present a united front in Hamburg, while making clear they preferred compromise to conflict.  These will not be easy talks,  Merkel said.  The differences are obvious and it would be wrong to pretend they aren't there. I simply won't do this.  The G20 summit will be held a little over a month after a G7 summit in Sicily exposed deep divisions between other western countries and Trump on climate change, trade and migration. A short while later, Trump announced he was pulling the United States out of a landmark agreement to combat climate change reached in 2015 in Paris. Ahead of the G20 summit, Trump's administration has threatened to take punitive trade measures against China, including introducing tariffs on steel imports. This has made for an unusually tense atmosphere before the summit and German officials acknowledge they have little idea what the final communique will look like. Asked about Merkel's comments, Trump's national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, said the U.S. relationship with Germany was  as strong as ever  and played down the discord.  Of course there are going to be differences in relations with any country, and we'll talk frankly about those differences. The president enjoys those conversations,  McMaster told reporters. The German hosts face a difficult challenge. Along with Trump, Russia's Vladimir Putin and Turkey's Tayyip Erdogan will be attending. All have strained relations with Merkel and other European leaders. The summit, in a convention center in the heart of Hamburg, could also be disrupted by tens of thousands of protesters expected to descend on the city of 1.7 million. Existential Challenge Merkel said she was  more determined than ever  to make the Paris accord a success since Trump's decision to pull out, calling climate change an  existential challenge .  We cannot wait until every last person on Earth has been convinced of the scientific proof,  she said.  Anybody who believes the problems of the world can be solved with isolationism and protectionism is making a big mistake,  Merkel said. Trump looks forward to discussing his economic rationale for quitting the deal during his G20 meetings, said Gary Cohn, his top economic adviser.  He’s going to ask for a fair and level playing field. We cannot be in a position where the United States is cutting and cutting emissions while others continue to grow,  Cohn told reporters. French President Emmanuel Macron, in Berlin for the meeting of EU leaders, which included the prime ministers of Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and Britain, said he hoped the United States would  return to reason  on climate. But he also stressed that it made little sense to try to isolate Trump in Hamburg.  The relationship with the United States is a long-term one and it is deep,  Macron said.  I believe we must continue an intense dialogue with the United States because of these ties which are historic and enduring.  At Macron's invitation, Trump will visit Paris a week after the July 7-8 G20 summit for Bastille Day celebrations. They spoke by phone on Tuesday and agreed to work together to respond to any new chemical attacks from the Syrian government. Donald Tusk, the former Polish prime minister who chairs summits of EU leaders, said in Berlin that European countries would speak with one voice in Hamburg, defending the rules-based international order that Trump has called into question.

The giant vessel, Britain's most advanced and biggest warship, embarked on its maiden voyage on Monday, prompting British Defense Secretary Michael Fallon to say he thought the Russians would look at it  with a little bit of envy.  Stung by that remark and angered by Fallon calling Russia's sole aircraft carrier  dilapidated,  the Russian defense ministry issued a strongly-worded statement on Thursday, criticizing Fallon and deriding the HMS Queen Elizabeth.  These rapturous statements ... about the supremacy of the new aircraft carrier's beautiful exterior over the Russian aircraft-carrying cruiser Admiral Kuznetsov expose Fallon's utter ignorance of naval military science,  the ministry said.  Like a bee, the British aircraft carrier is only capable of independently releasing planes from its belly closely flanked by a swarm of warships, support ships and submarines to protect it. That is why ... the British aircraft carrier is merely a large convenient naval target.  The aging Admiral Kuznetsov, Russia's only aircraft carrier, and a ship that Fallon has criticized more than once, was by contrast armed with an array of defensive missiles, the ministry said, warning the HMS Queen Elizabeth to keep her distance from the Russian navy.  It is in the interests of the British Royal Navy not to show off the 'beauty' of its aircraft carrier on the high seas any closer than a few hundred miles from its Russian 'distant relative',  the ministry said. Fallon offended Russia's military in January when he dubbed Moscow's sole aircraft carrier  a ship of shame  as it passed through waters close to the English coast on its way back from bombing raids in Syria.  Russia said at the time that Britain was staging a show by escorting the ship, the Admiral Kuznetsov, through the English Channel designed to distract attention away from the shortcomings of the British navy. The Kuznetsov, which entered service in 1991 in the Soviet Union's dying days, is part of Russia's Northern Fleet near Murmansk and is currently awaiting serious repairs.  Russia, striving to promote a more assertive foreign policy amid chilly ties with the West, is in the process of re-arming its army and the navy. But some experts at home and abroad say the Cold war-era Kuznetsov is now obsolete and that Russia needs a new generation of aircraft carriers.

The United States government has approved our purchase order for the four helicopters,  army chief General Chalermchai Sitthisart told reporters on Thursday, adding that the army already had 12 Black Hawk helicopters.   The matter will now be forwarded to Congress for approval,  he said. The U.S. embassy in Bangkok confirmed the plan to sell the four helicopters, adding that Thailand and the United States had a  long-standing security relationship . Thailand's military, which has a long history of intervention in politics, ousted a democratically elected government in May 2014 saying it had to step in to end a period of political turmoil. Several Western countries including the United States criticized the takeover. In response, the United States downgraded military and diplomatic ties with Thailand, its oldest ally in Asia, suspending arms sales and scaling back military exercises and training. Thailand, in turn, increasingly looked to other countries, in particular China, for its defense purchases. In April it approved a plan to purchase Chinese submarines worth $393 million. That same month, Thailand's cabinet approved the purchase of 10 Chinese tanks worth $58 million to replace an old U.S. model. But relations between the United States and Thailand appear to have improved under U.S. President Donald Trump. Trump last month spoke with the junta chief, Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, by telephone and invited him to visit the White House. Following the call, Prayuth said ties with the United States were  closer than ever . A U.S. embassy spokeswoman, Melissa Sweeney, told Reuters by email that over the past decade the United States had sold Thailand military equipment worth more than $960 million, including Black Hawk helicopters, air-to-air missile systems and multiple naval missile and torpedo systems. Since the coup, the approximate value of U.S. foreign military sales to Thailand was $380 million, she said.  Equipping has always been and remains integral to that relationship,  she said.  Army chief Chalermchai did not say how much the Black Hawk helicopters would cost but that the military's 2017 to 2019 budget would cover the cost. The junta has tentatively set a general election for 2018.

In shorts and sandals, he lights a blow torch, training a blue flame on a piece of ore which his barge dredged up from the bottom of the Madeira River in Brazil's northwestern Rondonia state, on the border with Bolivia.  Hundreds of similar barges - fashioned from plywood and metal and powered by roaring diesel motors - troll the rivers of the world's largest rainforest leaving trails of destruction in their wake, according to government officials.   I know this is a bit dangerous, but what else am I going to do to make a living here?  said the miner, who spoke on the condition of anonymity due to his involvement in illegal activity. When asked about safety equipment he just laughed.  Tens of thousands of illegal miners - or  garimpeiros  as they are known - have poured into the Amazon rainforest in Brazil, Peru, Bolivia, Venezuela and Colombia looking to strike it rich.  The gold rush has decimated the forest in parts of Amazon,  while poisoning people who depend on the rivers for their food with mercury and other toxins used in the extraction process.  The illicit industry is fueled by the trafficking of men to extract the gold and women to work as prostitutes servicing miners, according to Brazilian prosecutors.  Big, Dirty Business With billions of dollars at stake and complex criminal networks laundering illegally-mined gold across borders, officials admit they are struggling to contain the problem.   We have immense difficulties,  Ranilson Monteiro Camara from Brazil's Ministry of Mining told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in Porto Velho, Rondonia's gritty state capital.  Dozens of boats with no legal registration openly haul gold out of the river just two kilometers from his office. Camara said he is the department's only official in Rondonia State responsible for monitoring the garimpeiros and their billion dollar industry.   Levels of irregular (mining) activity on the river are high,  Camara said. Inspectors and other officials are working to try shutter illegal boats, while formally registering others so they can operate legally, he said.  It's no easy task. In a given year, illegal miners ship 40 tons of gold extracted from across the Amazon into the United States, according to a 2016 study by Verite, a Massachusetts-based watchdog. This is nearly twice the legal gold exports from the five Amazonian nations covered by the study.      Between 2006 and 2016, 68 tons of gold were illegally extracted from the Amazon and smuggled out of the region through Bolivia, according to the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime.  Illegal miners dump more than 30 tons of deadly mercury into Amazon Rivers each year, poisoning fish and causing brain damage to people living hundreds of kilometers (miles) downstream, according to the Carnegie Amazon Mercury Project, a U.S.-based scientific group.  Attempts at Regulation    Gold producers, for their part, say they are unfairly stigmatized as bandits despite many working within the law.    We are seen as bad by society, but actually we work, pay tax and support the local economy,  said Fabiano Sena Oliveira, a senior member of a gold producers' cooperative in Rondonia. Only 20 percent of the miners operate illegally, Oliveira told the Thomson Reuters Foundation from a storefront with barred windows where he buys and sells gold.  A gold mining boat sits in the Madeira River in Rondonia state, Brazil on June 4, 2017. Thomson Reuters Foundation/Chris ArsenaultCooperatives of mining boat owners are working to improve their environmental monitoring, and to make sure people register with authorities and pay their taxes, said Oliveira, a huge man wearing a gold chain and Ralph Lauren polo shirt.  In the past it's true miners used a lot of mercury,  he said, but today they use far less as it is expensive.  As part of the mining process mercury is mixed with rocks dredged from the bottom of the river. The mixture of mercury and sediment is then heated up, helping to separate the gold. But visits to garimpeiro boats by the Thomson Reuters Foundation appeared to contradict his remarks about miners moving away from mercury use. Life on the Boats     Sidney Magrao has spent the past 35 years as a garimpeiro. He works on a large mining boat with a powerful tube which sucks sediment from the bottom of the Madeira River. Miners on the boat then sift through the rocks and dirt for tiny pieces of gold.  Magrao started off in the business wading into small rivers with a hand-held tube and is now a senior operator on a boat worth 3 million reais ($900,000).  Slideshow (7 Images) I earned 23,000 reais last month ($7,000),  a huge salary for a working-class man in the Amazon, 62-year-old Magrao told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. He spoke while maneuvering levers to direct the boat's suction tube with a cigarette dangling in his mouth. The two story-barge with humming motors looks like something out of a science fiction movie like Mad Max or Water World. It has several sleeping rooms with bunk beds and a fulltime cook. Workers say it is formally registered with Brazilian authorities, meaning they have to pay tax on their earnings.    We are paid in gold,  said 60-year-old Valda Mendes, the boat's cook, as she prepared a lunch of rice and steak on open flames.   Laundering Profits       While some boats obey the law, much of the Amazon's gold is extracted from jungle land where mining is prohibited, said a local professor who studies the illicit trade.  In other cases gold is taken from lands or waters where mining is permitted but then smuggled from Brazil into Bolivia to avoid taxes, said Aurelio Herraiz from the Federal Institute of Education, Science and Technology of Amazonas State.   Many buyers go on boats to buy gold... This is invisible,  Herraiz told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  There is no record of it anywhere.  Mercury contamination is one of the biggest environmental threats from the trade, Herraiz said, and the toxic chemical is cheap and easy to obtain in neighboring Bolivia.   Police officials say tracking the movement of illicit gold and chemicals between different Amazon countries is difficult.   Like all frontiers, there are problems and issues here to be solved,  said Heliel Martins, a police chief in Rondonia. Back on the illegal mining boat, the 22-year-old worker opens a plastic bottle of mercury before pouring it onto a nugget of gold.  The boat's captain started as a cook in the industry 18 years ago, saved her money and then bought the vessel.   It's bureaucratic and expensive to get registered,  she said, adding that she had been fined heavily for operating illegally. To pay the fines for breaking the rules, she had just one source of revenue - gold.   Travel support for this reporting was provided by the Society of Environmental Journalists (SEJ).

Francois-Philippe Champagne is in Cincinnati for a meeting-packed June day as part of a concerted Canadian outreach campaign ahead of talks to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement. U.S. President Donald Trump describes the 1994 pact as a disaster and has threatened to walk away from it. Concerned that any moves to abandon NAFTA or curb trade could cost thousands of jobs, the Liberal government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau wants to remind Americans how important bilateral trade is while seeking allies to press the Canadian cause if threats emerge. Since Trump's inauguration, Canadian politicians and officials have made almost 160 trips, meeting 14 cabinet members, almost 200 lawmakers and more than 40 state governors and lieutenant governors. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2tpGUdU) Mexico, the pact's third partner, has been leading a similar campaign.[STORY LINK]  We have to hammer, hammer, hammer away at this and when we're exhausted, hammer again,  said one person involved in the Canadian effort. Champagne's message is simple:  We are your largest client.  Every day some 400,000 people and C$2.4 billion ($1.82 billion) worth of trade cross the border. Crimping that flow will hurt both nations, says Ottawa. In all of Ohio, more than 300,000 jobs depend on trade with Canada, Champagne notes. To help drive home the point, Canadian officials drill deep into the data. For example, their analysis shows that in Ohio's first congressional district, 17,269 jobs depended on Canada-U.S. trade and investment, with exports exceeding $1 billion. Champagne, who flew in late the night before, starts his day at Cincinnati's members-only Queen City Club, where he hosts a breakfast with a dozen local leaders.  Sometimes as friends and neighbors we take each other for granted,  he tells the group.  Let's make sure we don't put things in place that would disrupt supply chains.  Reuters was granted exclusive access to the meetings during Champagne's trip. Lawyer Daniel Ujczo, who specializes in Canada-U.S. affairs, tells Champagne his clients' biggest complaint is red tape that makes it hard to transfer specialists across the border.  I don't think companies will see a NAFTA win unless we address this,  he adds. Learning the Numbers Shortly afterwards Champagne tells a business forum of around 150 people that the greater Cincinnati area sends 20 percent of its exports to Canada. Diplomats hand out leaflets underlining the closeness of trade ties. In the car heading for his next appointment, Champagne reflects on the audience and tells aides:  They don't know many of the numbers.  That feeling is only underlined at a lunch with local politicians. William Seitz, a Republican member of Ohio's House of Representatives, admits afterwards his constituents know little about free trade.  Folks don't understand as well as they should that when we erect barriers to trade with foreign countries, we are increasing prices for domestic consumers,  he says. Champagne is willing to use any hook to make a connection. He  studied in Cleveland and in every meeting notes a local politician once called him  a son of Ohio . Later in the day he presents an honorary certificate to Joey Votto, the Canadian star of the Cincinnati Reds baseball team.  You're our best export,  Champagne says as cameras click. As his car speeds from the Reds stadium to another appointment in the late afternoon, he says:  It's been a great day ... We've made a small difference.  Officials track the number of trips and how many people they meet, but say ultimately what counts is whether their new-found allies will step up to defend trade with Canada. When Trump announced in April he might tear up NAFTA,  you had many Republican senators calling the White House and calling Trump to say 'This is crazy',  said another person involved in the campaign. Some of the callers had already been approached by Canada as part of the effort to contact influence-makers, that person said. The outreach effort is not intended to convey a threat, says David MacNaughton, Canada's ambassador to Washington. But he adds:  It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that at some point, if they keep doing things that harm Canadian companies, that it's going to be difficult for us to resist doing the same.  Canada initially chose to focus on 11 states, selected for their economic and political importance. These include Indiana, home of Vice President Mike Pence. The Canadians are  talking to people who talk to Pence , one official tells Champagne. A few days after the trip, Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale is in Minneapolis, Minnesota, at an exclusive reception to build awareness of bilateral ties.  When the relationship is without any great problems, people tend to go to sleep on both sides,  he tells Reuters. Attendees include Neel Kashkari, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, and Joc O'Rourke, chief executive officer of phosphate giant Mosaic Co. Asked about the Canadian message, O'Rourke says most companies want freer or fairer trade. Pressed as to whether they will stand up for Canada, he replies:  They will of course stand up for what is in their best interest.  Goodale acknowledges the outreach does not guarantee success, but adds:  our trade will do better, and our relationship will do better, the more vigorous and outgoing we are . Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland quipped last month that  if you're an American official or legislator, it's been hard to avoid a Canadian , but Goodale is not worried Canada might be wearing out its welcome.  They are so big I think it will be a long time before we have overdone it,  he says.

Gabriel, whose project has been in the works for 18 years, will argue that Romania violated several investment treaty provisions in its claim to the bank's International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes. The miner's project, near the village of Rosia Montana, was expected to produce 500,000 ounces of gold annually over 16 years of operation, making it Europe's largest gold mine.  The issue we've had in Romania is the project has been over-politicized. Politics has got in the way of progress,  Chief Executive Jonathan Henry said in a phone interview. The government withdrew its support for the project in 2014, striking down a bill to allow the development after nationwide protests by thousands of people across the country in 2013. The mine, which would dig four open pits, is 80.69 percent owned by Gabriel with Romania's state miner holding the remaining 19.31 percent. Civil rights and environment groups opposing the mine argued it would destroy ancient Roman mining shafts in the Rosia Montana village, its surrounding hillsides and pose an environmental risk from the cyanide used to process ore, a normal industry practice. Gabriel filed a request for arbitration with the World Bank in 2015, but it said the government had not responded to its notice of dispute or request for arbitration.  We are claiming that Romania has expropriated our project and we are left with no alternative but to seek compensation,  said Henry. Gabriel, which has invested some $700 million in Romania, was first granted an exploration licence in June, 1999. With no other mines, Gabriel will decide its plans after the case concludes. A hearing is scheduled Sept. 9 to 20, 2019. The project has potential to generate $24 billion for the country's economy, Gabriel estimates. First a mining district more than 2,000 years ago, Rosia Montana has suffered from  severe environmental degradation,  Gabriel argues. Romania, a member of the World Bank and European Union, is one of Europe's poorest countries, despite rich natural resources including gas, coal and gold.

At least 73 people are missing and 10 people are confirmed to have been killed after the landslide engulfed Xinmo village in the mountainous southwestern province early on Saturday, according to the latest official figures on Wednesday.  The publicity department of the Communist Party's central committee declined to comment on specific questions from Reuters about how it handled media coverage of the disaster, but offered a statement:   Chinese media published a large number of reports about the landslide. It has become commonplace for Chinese media to promptly and actively publish information when breaking news occurs.  However, half a dozen Chinese journalists covering the disaster told Reuters they were recalled on Sunday night by editors who said they had received orders from the publicity department to stop reporting on the event.  Gone are the days of being able to freely report on natural disasters,  said a journalist from an official party newspaper. All of the Chinese journalists Reuters spoke to for this story asked not to be named for fear of losing their jobs.   When I covered the 2008 Sichuan earthquake I was able to go anywhere in the earthquake site, interview anyone and report on any story I wanted. This time around, I wasn't even allowed into the rescue area, we were just given press releases (from the government) to write up.   Nearly 70,000 people died in the 2008 earthquake, the epicenter of which was in Wenchuan county, not far from Xinmo. Protecting the Party President Xi has overseen a drive to place the Communist Party back at the center of China's media, academia and charities, while reining in news organizations and research bodies and detaining rights lawyers.  All news media run by the Party must work to speak for the Party's will and its propositions and protect the Party's authority and unity,  Xi was quoted as saying while visiting the three big state news agencies in February 2016. The government's position on the media is that it guarantees freedom of expression but that the media has to operate in accordance with the law.  News about the landslide was pushed down the agenda of many  major Chinese news organizations monitored by Reuters at the weekend. State broadcaster CCTV ran its story almost twenty minutes into the Saturday night news, after stories about poverty alleviation and Xi's visit to a military base. Much of the coverage in the days since the landslide has focused on the heroic role of the rescue dogs and the types of food served to people involved in rescue efforts. Members of the media take pictures of rescue workers at the site of a landslide in the village of Xinmo, Mao County, Sichuan Province, China June 26, 2017.Aly SongThe Chinese language version of an article in leading business magazine Caixin which questioned the official view that the landslide was an unavoidable disaster was deleted late on Monday, according to China Digital Times, an online watchdog based in Berkeley, California. A less-detailed English language version of the story was still available on the magazine's global site. Villagers were quoted in the article as saying the government was partially to blame for the landslide because it did nothing after locals reported a large fissure had formed in the mountainside above them after the 2008 Sichuan earthquake.  Caixin was not immediately available for comment. Limited Access Slideshow (3 Images)Unlike the 2008 earthquake, which was widely dispersed and fell under the control of several different local governments, there is only one road in and out of Xinmo which is under the control of a single local government.  About 100 relatives and villagers who were away when the landslide occurred met government officials at a primary school on Monday to complain about the lack of information and access to Xinmo. They were eventually allowed back. A journalist at a state-backed Chinese media organization said he had planned to accompany the group back to Xinmo but was deterred from going by his own editors.   Our big boss called me specifically to tell me we had to leave today and stop reporting,  he told Reuters. After another earthquake in Sichuan in 2013, People's Liberation Army soldiers invited Reuters reporters to eat lunch with them near the disaster zone and armed police offered journalists rides to get closer to the epicenter.  But on Sunday, many Chinese and foreign news organizations,  including Reuters, were blocked by police from accessing the site. Efforts to get government help were thwarted.  I am just a tiny foot soldier, I cannot help you,  said a local official surnamed Yang who was listed online as the site's press liaison, before he hung up the phone.  Reuters journalists who made it to the area were confronted by police officers who herded them out on foot, then followed the Reuters vehicle in two police cars and a van to nearby Diexi town. The journalists were escorted by a cohort of about 20 police to the local publicity office which instructed them to drive back to the capital of Sichuan.  We have a press center in a hotel in Chengdu, you can get all the information you need there,  said Zhang Ya, a local publicity official.

Moscow denies direct involvement in the conflict despite NATO's assertions its troops are supporting the rebels. Russia banned wholesale imports of fresh food products from many Western countries in 2014 in retaliation for the EU sanctions.

Cyprus is keen to develop its energy sector to bolster an economy that relies largely on tourism and business services. But its efforts could be complicated by the island's division between Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots. Turkey, which supports a breakaway Turkish Cypriot state in northern Cyprus, says the island's Greek Cypriot-led government has no right to explore for hydrocarbons. On Wednesday, Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot leaders began fresh reunification talks in what United Nations mediators say represents the best chance at peace in decades.  There is absolutely no doubt that being able to resolve such a longstanding issue, as well as others which are pending in our region, will go a long way to mitigate ... the political risk,  Cypriot Energy Minister Yiorgos Lakkotrypis told a conference in Athens. But he added Cyprus would  have to work around  the challenges.  If, in the Eastern Med, with all the challenges that exist between the countries, we were waiting for all of them to be resolved before we take action ... we wouldn't have done anything so far,  Lakkotrypis said.  We need to continue to work together in this region in order to derisk all the projects that are on the table.  Cyprus has approved contracts with France's Total, Italy's Eni, Exxon Mobil and Qatar Petroleum to explore for oil and gas in offshore areas south of the island. It made its first natural gas discovery in 2011. (Reporting by Karolina Tagaris and Angeliki Koutantou, editing by David Evans)","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/energy-cyprus-idUSL8N1JQ2JN"},

The Constitutional Court said a ruling by the lower administrative court, which blocked the expansion project for environmental reasons in February, was a  misguided decision . It  involved climate protection and land consumption in an unconstitutional way in its weighing of interests,  said Constitutional Court President Gerhart Holzinger. Airport expansion is a hot topic in Europe, pitting local residents and environmentalists against airlines, airports and businesses. Law experts see the Austrian case as trend-setting for other major infrastructure projects. Holzinger ordered the administrative court, which said a third runway would run counter to Austria's pledge to the Paris climate agreement and that the creation of 30,000 new jobs could not justify the extra pollution, to decide again on the issue. Vienna Airport shares gained as much as 1.4 percent after the decision, outperforming the European sector index, which was 0.6 percent lower at 1027 GMT. Vienna Airport, which had said the ban ignored its fundamental rights, welcomed the decision.  An infrastructure project that is so important for the future again has a chance of realisation,  said Guenther Ofner, a member of Vienna Airport's management board. The airport is the country's biggest, serving as a secondary hub in the Lufthansa-Star Alliance network and focussing on Eastern Europe and on intercontinental destinations in Asia. Austria's Transport Minister Joerg Leichtfried, also welcoming the ruling, said he now hoped for a  swift decision . Plans for a third runway at the Vienna airport were first submitted for review in March 2007. Initially, the airport planned to open it in 2021; now it hopes for 2028.

In July, the details should be out,  she said, declining to elaborate. Ruchukorn did not confirm whether the measures would include a curb on the number of credit cards or a credit limit, as reported by some Thai media. She said the central bank will take into consideration what impact new measures will have.  If there is too much tightening, it may make people turn to informal loans more,  she added. At the end of 2016, Thailand's household debt was nearly 80 percent of gross domestic product, among the highest in Asia. Household debts have restrained consumption, traditionally a key driver of Thailand's growth, which has lagged that of regional peers in recent years. Last month, the BOT and banks announced a  debt clinic  programme to tackle some unsecured consumer loans that became bad credits. Non-performing loans of Thai banks rose to 2.94 percent of total lending at the end of March from 2.83 percent at end-2016.

Quoting an unidentified official with  China's national security department , the Global Times tabloid said the Australian government was spying on China and monitoring Chinese people in Australia.  The national security department staffer said Australia's agents in disguise would get close to Chinese people working or living overseas to collect information or even encourage them to subvert China,  the report said.  Meanwhile, in the name of avoiding 'Chinese spy threats', Australian intelligence operatives are closely monitoring Chinese people and the Chinese Embassy in Australia,  it said. The report said  many  Chinese people had been interviewed or harassed and were being required to give information about Chinese communities and the Chinese Embassy.  Some of the Chinese people were even sent back to China to gather information,  it said. Chinese authorities have found  many eavesdropping devices at the embassy , which had forced the government to renovate it, the employee told the newspaper, which is published by the official People's Daily.

Stung by that remark and angered by Fallon calling Russia's sole aircraft carrier  dilapidated,  the Russian defense ministry issued a strongly-worded statement on Thursday, criticizing Fallon and deriding the HMS Queen Elizabeth.  These rapturous statements ... about the supremacy of the new aircraft carrier's beautiful exterior over the Russian aircraft-carrying cruiser Admiral Kuznetsov expose Fallon's utter ignorance of naval military science,  the ministry said.  Like a bee, the British aircraft carrier is only capable of independently releasing planes from its belly closely flanked by a swarm of warships, support ships and submarines to protect it. That is why ... the British aircraft carrier is merely a large convenient naval target.  The aging Admiral Kuznetsov, Russia's only aircraft carrier, and a ship that Fallon has criticized more than once, was by contrast armed with an array of defensive missiles, the ministry said, warning the HMS Queen Elizabeth to keep her distance from the Russian navy.  It is in the interests of the British Royal Navy not to show off the 'beauty' of its aircraft carrier on the high seas any closer than a few hundred miles from its Russian 'distant relative',  the ministry said. Fallon offended Russia's military in January when he dubbed Moscow's sole aircraft carrier  a ship of shame  as it passed through waters close to the English coast on its way back from bombing raids in Syria.  Russia said at the time that Britain was staging a show by escorting the ship, the Admiral Kuznetsov, through the English Channel designed to distract attention away from the shortcomings of the British navy. The Kuznetsov, which entered service in 1991 in the Soviet Union's dying days, is part of Russia's Northern Fleet near Murmansk and is currently awaiting serious repairs.  Russia, striving to promote a more assertive foreign policy amid chilly ties with the West, is in the process of re-arming its army and the navy. But some experts at home and abroad say the Cold war-era Kuznetsov is now obsolete and that Russia needs a new generation of aircraft carriers.

The United States government has approved our purchase order for the four helicopters,  army chief General Chalermchai Sitthisart told reporters on Thursday, adding that the army already had 12 Black Hawk helicopters.   The matter will now be forwarded to Congress for approval,  he said. The U.S. embassy in Bangkok confirmed the plan to sell the four helicopters, adding that Thailand and the United States had a  long-standing security relationship . Thailand's military, which has a long history of intervention in politics, ousted a democratically elected government in May 2014 saying it had to step in to end a period of political turmoil. Several Western countries including the United States criticized the takeover. In response, the United States downgraded military and diplomatic ties with Thailand, its oldest ally in Asia, suspending arms sales and scaling back military exercises and training. Thailand, in turn, increasingly looked to other countries, in particular China, for its defense purchases. In April it approved a plan to purchase Chinese submarines worth $393 million. That same month, Thailand's cabinet approved the purchase of 10 Chinese tanks worth $58 million to replace an old U.S. model. But relations between the United States and Thailand appear to have improved under U.S. President Donald Trump. Trump last month spoke with the junta chief, Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, by telephone and invited him to visit the White House. Following the call, Prayuth said ties with the United States were  closer than ever . A U.S. embassy spokeswoman, Melissa Sweeney, told Reuters by email that over the past decade the United States had sold Thailand military equipment worth more than $960 million, including Black Hawk helicopters, air-to-air missile systems and multiple naval missile and torpedo systems. Since the coup, the approximate value of U.S. foreign military sales to Thailand was $380 million, she said.  Equipping has always been and remains integral to that relationship,  she said.  Army chief Chalermchai did not say how much the Black Hawk helicopters would cost but that the military's 2017 to 2019 budget would cover the cost.

U.S. banking shares rallied after the Fed approved plans from the 34 largest lenders to use extra capital for stock buybacks, dividends and other purposes.      Meanwhile, crude oil rose for a sixth straight session to its highest since June 19 on a decline in U.S. output.      Last week, there was concern with lower-than-expected inventories and so forth. Now that oil prices have stabilized, the market is reacting positively,  said Victor Felix, an equity analyst with AB Capital Securities.     Singapore shares closed 1.3 percent higher as heavyweights DBS Group Holdings and United Overseas Bank gained 2.5 percent each.      Singapore's central bank said its investment gains on official foreign reserves quadrupled to S$21.9 billion ($15.80 billion) in the last financial year, helped by a recovery in the global financial market.     Vietnam shares rose 0.4 percent as Joint Stock Commercial Bank for Investment and Development of Vietnam rose 1.8 percent and Military Commercial Joint Stock Bank gained 2.3 percent.      Philippine shares closed 0.9 percent lower at an over one-month low, dragged by the real estate and telecommunications sectors.     PLDT and Ayala Land fell 3.6 percent and 2.3 percent, respectively.       The Philippine peso is weakening against the dollar. That is also putting pressure on equities,  Felix added.     Investors have trimmed their long positions in most Asian currencies compared with two weeks ago, a Reuters poll showed, amid jitters that the European Central Bank may be getting ready to reduce its aggressive monetary stimulus.

The five-times Olympic gold medalist notched her 12th  career national title with a time of one minute 54.84 seconds in Indianapolis as she ramps up for the worlds in Budapest. On Tuesday, the opening night of the meet, Ledecky qualified for the 800m freestyle in a year's best time and is also qualified for the 1,500m. Should Ledecky, who won four golds at the Rio Olympics, finish in the top two in Friday's 400m free, she will be in line to contest six events in Budapest, including relays, for her busiest schedule yet at an Olympics or worlds.  I’ve been slightly improving throughout the spring,  said Ledecky.  I’m certainly growing my confidence in this race.  Olympic champion Ryan Murphy won the national title in the men's 200m backstroke while Townley Haas earned his first individual national title with a decisive win in the men's 200m freestyle. Kevin Cordes won the 200m breaststroke while Caeleb Dressel claimed his first national title in the men's 50m butterfly and qualified for his second event after already earning a spot in the 100m freestyle.

The GST will replace about 20 federal and state taxes such as factory-gate duties, service and local taxes while unifying $2 trillion economy and 1.3 billion people into a single market.  Modi, a Hindu nationalist politician who swept to power in 2014 promising reforms to get India's lumbering economy moving, will use the occasion to make a landmark speech. Somewhat predictably, not everyone in the world's largest democracy is happy.  Even though the Congress Party first proposed the tax reform before it fell from power three years ago, it has been left  wringing its hands over whether to join the parliamentary applause for a tax that should make India a far easier place to do business. Mamata Banerjee, the firebrand leader of All India Trinamool Congress, certainly won't be clapping. The firebrand leader of the regional party governing West Bengal intends to boycott the event, saying the ill-planned launch will hurt small enterprises across the country.   A chaotic situation may arise in our vast economy,   Banerjee told reporters in Kolkata, adding millions of small businesses were not yet ready to file multiple tax returns, and it could take up to six months to smoothly implement the legislation. Labourers sit next to a banner after a protest against the implementation of the goods and services tax (GST) on textiles, in the old quarters of Delhi, India June 29, 2017. The banner reads “Remove GST – save business”.Adnan AbidiThousands of textile mills and retailers across the country went on strike this week to protest the tax. Small businesses in particular are unhappy at the extra demands made of them to be tax compliant during the change-over. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has given businesses two months leeway to file late returns during the switch to GST.. Slideshow (6 Images)A massive media campaign has been launched by the government to create awareness, with telephone help lines opened to address public concerns.  So far, more than three-quarters of the 8.1 million firms registered with the federal and state tax departments have enrolled with the GST Network, a massive IT back-end that will process up to 5 billion invoices a month. Millions of small businesses, outside the tax net earlier, still have to join the network, and an umbrella organization pleaded for them to be given more time.    For a seamless implementation of the law, the government should relax rules against traders for procedural lapses for six to nine months,  Praveen Khandelwal, secretary general of the Confederation of All India Traders, said. About a third of association's 60 million members lack a computer to register under the new tax regime.

Modi was speaking a week after a 16-year old Muslim boy was stabbed to death on a train on suspicion of possessing beef, the latest of an estimated 28 people killed in cow-related violence since 2010. Most of the victims were killed after Modi and his Hindu nationalist party won elections three years ago.  Killing people in the name of 'gau bhakti' is not acceptable,  he told a crowd at a Hindu ashram, or place of meditation, referring to cow worship.  No person in this nation has the right to take the law in his or her own hands,  he said at the ashram dedicated to the father of the nation and pacifist Mahatma Gandhi, in Modi's home state of Gujarat. Modi said protecting cows was right, but it should be done legally. The slaughter of cows is banned, and the consumption of beef restricted, in most Indian states. But millions of people in the minority Muslim and lower-caste Hindu communities depend on work in the meat and leather industries. Since coming to power, Modi has found it difficult to balance the competing demands of Hindu right-wing groups - some linked to his party - intent on promoting a Hindu ideology and protecting cows, and promoting development and an image of a modern, secular India befitting its growing economic influence. On Wednesday, small protests were held in several cities to denounce the lynchings and to pressure the government to do more. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi arrives to spin cotton on a wheel during his visit to Gandhi Ashram in Ahmedabad, India, June 29, 2017.Amit Dave'We Want Action' Critics and opposition politicians have accused Modi of failing to condemn the violence and the so-called cow protection groups, some with links to his party, accused of fomenting the attacks, a charge the prime minister's Bharatiya Janata Party denies.  I am glad that the prime minister finally came out and said something, but it is not enough. We have to put our money where our mouth is. We want action,  said a senior leader of the opposition Congress party, Renuka Chowdhury. Muslims hold banners as they protest against the recent cases of mob lynching of Muslims who were accused of possessing beef, after offering Eid al-Fitr prayers in Ahmedabad, India June 26, 2017.Amit Dave The ground reality is something else. What is the government going to do? What action plan do they have ... Are we to live in terror?  she asked. Vigilante groups that seize cows from people they accuse of illegally transporting them, or sending them for slaughter, have stepped up operations across India in recent years, rattling members of religious minorities. Allegations that Modi will edge towards redefining India as a Hindu nation were reignited in March when he appointed a hardline Hindu priest as the chief minister of India's most populous state.  Yogi Adityanath, who has since launched a crackdown on illegal abattoirs, has a history of agitation against Muslims. Modi's party has consistently said it does not make any distinction between citizens on the basis of religion. Muslims make up 14 percent of India's 1.3 billion people.

Two weeks into the job, Stephen Barclay, a former financial regulator who has worked in banking, struck a conciliatory tone, saying it was very clear that the pace of regulation has not abated.  In government we need to be mindful of the cumulative impact,  Barclay told a British Bankers' Association conference. Banks face new rules to prevent money laundering, requiring them to ring-fence their retail arms with their own layer of capital, and opening up the payments services market with new EU rules to boost innovation, Barclay said. He wanted to give banks as much time as possible to implement the new EU rules and said he had asked officials to lay out the regulations before parliament's summer break. The banking sector faces potential upheaval with Britain's departure from the European Union in 2019, given the cross-border activities in the sector.  In leaving the EU we need to prioritise British prosperity, recognising the need for an implementation period, so we have a slope, not a sudden cliff edge,  Barclay said, reiterating a view already expressed by finance minister Philip Hammond. The government will respond  quickly and constructively  to the banking sector, mindful of the 71 billion pounds ($92 billion) of tax the financial services contributes to public services and the million people it employs, he said.  I am conscious of the way the industry is often portrayed – with the Wall Street image of bankers far removed from the experience of cashiers and the many other staff in retail branches across the country,  Barclay said.

The 31-year-old Scot, who won the Queen's Club doubles title with Brazilian Bruno Soares, said the constant focus on the top players was undermining the quality of tennis the rest of the field was capable of producing on the tour. The men's singles field is dominated by Andy Murray, Novak Djokovic, Roger Federer and Rafa Nadal with only five of the last 40 grand slam crowns have eluded the quartet.  The ATP have pushed these four guys (Andy Murray, Novak Djokovic, Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal) which means the problem is that anyone not in the top ten isn't very good and that's not true,  Jamie told the Times.  Andy lost last week to Jordan Thompson, who (was) 90 in the world, and everyone says it's the worst loss ever, but the guy winning the US Open golf could be 100th in the world and no one says anything but 'well played'.  When people think of tennis they think of the four players at the top of the game. The sport isn’t promoted, the players are -- and that will be a problem when these guys stop playing.  The top three seeds Andy Murray, Stan Wawrinka and Milos Raonic made early exits at the Queen's Club last week but Jamie believes the tournament still had players in the draw that produced quality tennis for the rest of the week.  At the Queen's, the top three seeds lost on the Tuesday in the first round and everyone was panicking, saying it's a disaster for the tournament,  he added.   But you got an incredible final that was really exciting (the 35-year-old Feliciano Lopez beating Marin Cilic in three sets).  Jamie and his doubles partner Soares, who also won in Stuttgart earlier this month, hope to win their third grand slam title together at next week's Wimbledon.

The men have been accused of breaching the colonial-era Unlawful Associations Act after covering an event on Monday where the rebel Ta'ang National Liberation Army (TNLA) burned piles of narcotics to mark International Day Against Drug Abuse.  We don't really think our journalists have working relations with the TNLA group, which (the government) calls terrorists,  said Than Win Htut, planning editor at the Democratic Voice of Burma (DVB), the employer of two of the journalists.  They are just doing a journalist's job.  The TNLA, which demands more autonomy for the Ta'ang ethnic group, regularly clashes with government forces. Broadcaster DVB's Aye Nai and Pyae Phone Naing, and Lawi Weng of the Irrawaddy magazine, were remanded along with three others in Hsipaw prison, in northern Shan State, on Wednesday. They will be brought before a court on July 11, said Thein Zaw, head of the police station handling the case in the town of Hsipaw.  Critics disappointed with Aung San Suu Kyi's first year in power say the case highlights the gaps in Myanmar's transition from military rule to full democracy. Suu Kyi's defenders say the Nobel Peace Prize winner - who spent years under house arrest for opposing Myanmar's junta - is hamstrung by a military-drafted constitution that keeps the generals in politics and free from civilian oversight. Suu Kyi's spokesman has said the journalists should be treated  according to the law . But Phil Robertson, deputy director for New York-based Human Rights Watch's Asia division, said Suu Kyi should use her majority in parliament to rein in the military.  It's hard to tell what Aung San Suu Kyi thinks, but if she believes she can convince the army to somehow reform or moderate their behavior, this is more evidence to show that she's profoundly mistaken,  he said. A Risky Return A reporter works in the Democratic Voice of Burma (DVB) news room in Yangon, Myanmar June 29, 2017.Soe Zeya TunThe case has sparked outrage among the boisterous media that emerged in the commercial hub Yangon after the government lifted pre-publication censorship in 2012. Journalists will gather signatures on Friday calling for the release of the three men - and of an editor charged in a separate case with defamation over a satirical article mocking the army. Both DVB and the Irrawaddy were set up in exile in Thailand, receiving funding from Western governments and NGOs, and have opened bureaus in Yangon since 2012. Aye Nai, 53, and Lawi Weng, 38, returned to Myanmar to cover the conflicts between the army and ethnic rebels. Lawi Weng, a member of southern Myanmar's Mon ethnic minority, is a practicing Buddhist who meditates each morning and night. He had planned to marry this year. Loa Htaw, his fiancée, said Lawi Weng knew the risks his repeated trips to conflict areas entailed.  Both he and I (were) aware that he might face prison if he keeps writing about our ethnic armed groups and criticizes the military and government,  she wrote in a message to Reuters. However,  he needs to report for the voiceless and the powerless , Loa Htaw said. Part of the new generation of Myanmar journalists to emerge since the reforms, 24-year-old Pyae Phone Naing worked for several media organizations before joining DVB about four months ago, his father, Kyaw Soe Oo, told Reuters. On Monday evening, Pyae Phone Naing called his mother. He informed her that he was in a military camp, but not to worry, his father said. The parents did not realize the gravity of the situation until later, when relatives started calling having seen news reports of their son's detention.  It gives me pain in my heart. I always worry about him, even when he comes home late on usual days,  Kyaw Soe Oo told Reuters.  I want my son to be released.

The election of President Emmanuel Macron has provided an opening for Paris to re-examine its Syria policy, with the view that the previous government's stance that Assad must step down was too intransigent and an obstacle to peacemaking. Macron last week reversed France's stance on the future of Assad, saying he saw no legitimate successor at this time and the priority was to prevent Syria becoming a failed state. The United States has also backed away this year from an insistence on Assad's departure to allow a political solution. Assad has held on with Russian and Iranian military support in a six-year war with rebels and Islamist militants that has killed hundreds of thousands and displaced millions.  New Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian has been pushing for closer dialogue with Moscow as Paris also seeks to use the lack of clear U.S. policy on Syria to give itself a greater role.   I can't give any details, but I think that there is a window of opportunity at the moment. Like everybody, I think the Russians are conscious that there is no military solution to the conflict,  Le Drian, who was defense minister under Macron's predecessor Francois Hollande, said in an published interview.  We should be able to get there with a new method that encompasses establishing robust principles that seem unquestionable, without setting rhetorical preconditions but by creating new bridges between the different actors,  he said. Le Drian did not explain in the interview with Le Monde what those principles were or what incentives Russia would be given. France, a supporter of the Syrian opposition until now, has demanded the conflict be resolved through a credible political transition based on U.N. Security Council resolutions negotiated between the warring parties with the United Nations in Geneva. Le Drian, who held six hours of talks primarily on Syria with Russian officials in Moscow last week and has said the priority for France was weakening the threat from Islamic State militants, made no mention of the those resolutions or Geneva. He called for diplomatic support from permanent members of the Security Council and regional players. A French diplomat said Paris hoped to create a small contact group that could push peace efforts forward. French officials said part of the reason why Paris has pushed for renewed dialogue with Russia on Syria is the vacuum left by the United States, which they deem has no clear policy beyond defeating Islamic State.  The Russians have nobody else. They have no coherent interlocutor. The Russians have nothing else to get their teeth into other than the French,  said a European diplomat. Syria's civil war has turned to Assad's favor since 2015, when Russia sent its jets to help his army and allied Shi'ite militias backed by Iran turned back rebels and won new ground. But the conflict is far from over, with rebels holding swathes of Syria, especially in the northwest and southeast, and Islamic State controlling other areas in the north and east.

Founded in 1963 by Bruce McLaren and known for winning Formula 1 titles with drivers such as Lewis Hamilton, McLaren set up a separate sports car maker known as McLaren Automotive in 2010 to rival the likes of Ferrari and Aston Martin. Since then the firm has grown rapidly, with sales doubling to 3,286 vehicles in 2016 and profit rising by 70 percent to 9.2 million pounds ($12 million).  The carmaker said earlier this year it would create 200 jobs as part of a 50 million pounds investment to build carbon-fibre chassis in northern England, its first purpose-built site away from its headquarters in the southern English town of Woking.  With a range of new models expected to drive further growth, the firm's director for sales and marketing said he expected another all-time high this year.   Having the new, second-generation Super Series and the first-ever Sports Series convertible in showrooms will give every one of the 80 McLaren retailers worldwide the opportunity to contribute strongly to another record year,  said Jolyon Nash.  The firm expects to reach sales of 4,500 vehicles by the end of 2022, with at least half equipped with hybrid powertrains.

Under the fund's operating guidelines, it could sell holdings in firms that do not meet its ethnical code. At the end of 2016, the fund had a 1.29 percent stake worth $11 million in Hansae Co Ltd, which manufactures garments in Vietnam and several other countries. It also owned a 1.52 percent stake worth $5.2 million in its parent Hansae Yes24.  The companies are placed under observation because of an unacceptable risk that the companies contribute to, or are responsible for, systematic violations of human rights,  the board of the central bank wrote in a statement. A spokesman for the two firms told Reuters they had conducted an internal investigation of working conditions at the Vietnam plant this year that resulted in efforts to improve working conditions and related issues. The Norwegian fund is a managed by a unit of the central bank. The fund's ethics watchdog, the Council on Ethics, makes recommendations to the central bank's executive board, which decides whether to act. The council recommended a prompt exclusion of the two firms from the portfolio, but the board of the central bank decided to put the stakes under observation.  The Council on Ethics highlights that the companies have taken measures to improve the working conditions. The Executive Board believes that these measures provide sufficient grounds to observe the development in the future,  the bank said. Norway's sovereign wealth fund holds stakes in almost 9,000 companies in 77 countries. Ethics guidelines prevent the fund investing in makers of nuclear weapons, cluster bombs and tobacco, among other things. The guidelines also bar investment in firms deemed to be violating human rights or damaging the environment.

Most analysts agree that Beijing's crackdown on debt risks and tightening financial conditions will slow China's momentum after a strong start to the year when first quarter growth came in at 6.9 percent.  Corporates are already facing higher financing costs, which could ripple through to decisions on investment, hiring, and wages over the next year.  Moreover, a raft of property curbs have effectively cooled sales in the biggest cities and started dragging on property investment. Indeed, investment growth in the real estate sector slowed for the first time in three months in May. That could hurt the construction sector - a big boon for the economy in the past few quarters.  We believe that deleveraging has continued in June and it had some cooling impact on the economy,  said Kelvin Lau, senior economist for Greater China at Standard Chartered.  We are also taking into account the cooling measures on the real estate sector.  The official manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) is expected to come in at 51.0, which would be the lowest reading since September though capping the eleventh straight month of growth, according to a median forecast of 34 economists polled by Reuters. The index stabilized at 51.2 in the months of April and May, after hitting 51.8 in March - its highest level in nearly five years. Interestingly, the official PMI survey, which will be released on June 30, along with the official services PMI, showed a divergence with the private Caixin/Markit PMI manufacturing survey in May, which focuses more on small and mid-sized firms. The private survey, due on July 3, showed the sector struggling to motor on - a contradiction that analysts suspected showed heavy industry was the biggest beneficiary of a construction boom and government stimulus support.   China's economy generally remained on a solid footing in May, with profits at industrial companies bouncing back from April.  China's export growth more than halved in May, in line with a general cooling in demand for electronic gadgets. But while trade friction between China and some key trading partners remains, an overall improvement in global growth means shipments from the world's largest exporter will likely remain strong this year. And analysts say Beijing will be keen to keep key sectors of the economy growing at a steady pace so it can meet its full-year growth target of about 6.5 percent, down from 6.7 percent in 2016 - the slowest annual pace in 26 years. All the same, the challenges for policymakers are aplenty.  Producer price inflation (PPI), for instance, fell for the third straight month in May on tumbling prices of raw materials, reinforcing expectations of a slowdown that would be bad news for debt-laden firms. Massive debt - standing at nearly 300 percent of GDP - and serious budgetary imbalances mean Beijing can't carry on pump priming - factors that analysts say will eventually drag on growth during the year.

The measure is part of policy efforts to defuse a demographic time bomb that could hit the ageing continent over the next 50 years when the ratio of retirees to working-age people is estimated to double. As EU states' stretched public finances are already struggling to cover the current levels of pensions, the European Commission is trying to encourage personal savings to make up for lower pensions. The proposed Pan-European Personal Pension Product (PEPP), if approved by EU states and the EU parliament, will give consumers a new savings option and is expected to increase the number of people subscribing to a personal pension, the Commission said. Currently only 27 percent of working-age EU citizens have bought personal pensions, which complement occupational and state-funded pensions, setting aside 700 billion euros managed by banks, pension funds or insurances. The industry is expected to double its size in the EU by 2030, but the Commission said that, with PEPP, assets under management could reach 2.1 trillion euros. This is expected to benefit countries where there is virtually no market for personal pension products, particularly in eastern Europe. The Commission said that only in Germany, Austria, Slovenia, Spain and Sweden 15 percent or more of eligible consumers made such investments. Mobile workers, who build their pension in several EU states, could also show interest, although they may face costs for merging the capital accumulated in different countries. EU countries will remain free to set their tax treatment of PEPP, although the Commission urged them to grant PEPP the same tax relief applied to national products. PEPP providers will need authorisation from the EU pension regulator, the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA). Managers of PEPP assets will be free to invest in all assets, including derivatives, as long as they respect consumers' choices when they opt for prudent investment.

The benchmark S&P;/ASX 200 index will rise about 2.5 percent from Wednesday's close of 5,755.7, reaching 5,900 by end-2017, according to the median forecast of 16 strategists surveyed by Reuters. That forecast is a little weaker than in a March poll, but mid-2018 expectations for the benchmark are unchanged at 6,050. The index is expected to reach 6,117 by end-2018. Moody's Investors Service downgraded 12 Australian banks last week, citing elevated risks. The Australian financials index is now on track for its first annual loss in six years. The federal government imposed a levy on Australia's five biggest lenders in its last budget, seeking to arrest a decade-long run of deficits, and sparking intense lobbying against the measure by the major banks.  But further pressure was then heaped on the big banks when one state decided to adopt a levy of its own and another expressed an interest in following suit.    The intense debate over the bank levy is not surprising given the impact on bank earnings, and the risk of future increases in the levy once in place,  Citi analysts said in a  note. Last week Australia's central bank ramped up its rhetoric over the financial stability risks presented by the overheated property market, household debt and record low wage growth. Some poll respondents said domestic stocks face significant risks from their U.S. peers, which have been on an upward trend because of optimism over U.S. President Donald Trump's economic plans - a phenomenon nicknamed the  Trump bump . Australian shares have generally been tracking developments in U.S. markets. Some poll respondents cited worries about Trump being unable to deliver on his policies as a likely cause for a 10 percent correction in the market in the next six months. Half the respondents thought the chance of a correction by year-end was minimal given how well investors had absorbed shocks without panicking, referring to major political events such as Brexit and Trump's election as U.S. President.  If there were to be a trigger it would likely be a geopolitical event such as military action involving North Korea or a significant terrorist event,  said Craig James, chief equities economist at Commonwealth Securities.

Since last June's shock vote in which Britons voted to leave the EU, the FTSE has weathered growing political uncertainty in the Britain on the back of a weak sterling which helps profits of international blue-chips that dominate the index. The index hit an intra-day record high of 7,598 earlier this month before a cloudy policy outlook after an inconclusive general election along with a slide in oil prices and a firmer pound dented the appetite for British shares among foreign investors.  No-one knows where the Brexit talks and events in Westminster will lead in the short term, which may not help sentiment, while more fundamentally the mix of FTSE 100 earnings growth still does not really appeal,  said Russ Mould, an investment director at AJ Bell.  Oil and metals prices are hardly buoyant and the banks and insurers are hardly any easier to forecast, especially as the UK economy is not doing a particularly great job of accelerating beyond stall speed,  Mould added. Reflecting the uncertainty, the range of year-end forecasts in the poll of 24 market watchers was wider than in a March poll - which had predicted the index would be at 7,425 now - and ranged from 6,500 to 8,050. The median was for 7,550, a 2 percent rise from here. On Wednesday, the index closed at 7,387.80 and is expected to set new records next year, reaching 7,650 by end-June 2018 and 7,950 by the time 2018 is over. The FTSE, while expected to steadily rise, is set to underperform most peers in the euro zone where the mood is upbeat and political risks are seen to have largely evaporated following Emmanuel Macron's convincing victory in the French presidential and parliamentary elections. [EPOLL/FRDE] In Britain, however, after over two weeks of talks and turmoil sparked by Prime Minister Theresa May's failure to win a majority in a June 8 snap election, a deal was struck this week with Northern Ireland's largest Protestant party to prop up a minority Tory government. While the UK economy has proved more resilient than expected since last June's Brexit referendum, signs of a slowdown, particularly on consumer spending, are starting to appear.

The Nikkei share average is forecast to trade at 20,750 at the end of the year, up 3 percent from Wednesday's close of 20,130.41, according to the median of 20 analysts and fund managers polled by Reuters in the past week.  It is then forecast to reach 21,500 by end-June 2018. Three months ago, the consensus among forecasters polled by Reuters had the Nikkei at 19,000 around now, which was too pessimistic. Only three of 21 forecasters surveyed in March thought it would be higher than where it is now.   The strong U.S. economy, weak yen and solid Japanese corporate earnings will likely lift Japanese stocks higher,  said Hiroyuki Fukunaga, chief executive of Investrust. Forecasts for end-2017 ranged from 18,500 to 23,000. They were 20,000 to 24,000 for mid-2018, and 19,000-25,000 for end-December 2018. After closing out 2016 just above 19,114 the benchmark index struggled earlier this year on geopolitical concerns, with a stronger yen capping gains. There were also worries of political turmoil in the U.S. as President Donald Trump's firing of former FBI director James Comey heightened risk aversion as investors fretted that Trump's economic agenda could get derailed. But the French presidential election in late April triggered a turnaround in global investor confidence.  The Nikkei began recovering from five-month lows as fears faded about a populist surge in Europe after Emmanuel Macron, touting a business-friendly vision of European integration, was elected president of France. The dollar has stayed strong against the yen, which would lift Japanese manufacturers' profits abroad and boosted expectations of solid earnings this fiscal year.   We expect Japanese companies to post an 11 percent gain in pre-tax profits this year. Companies should be able to prove that they are on track for strong results at their April-June period earnings releases,  said Takuya Takahashi, a strategist at Daiwa Securities, who expected the Nikkei to trade at 22,000 at end-2017 and 22,500 at June 2018.  Unless the yen strengthens sharply from the current level, companies earnings should support the Japanese market,  Takahashi said. Daiwa expects the dollar to trade around 110 yen throughout the fiscal year ending March 2018. The latest Reuters foreign exchange poll has it at 106 yen by end-May 2018. On Wednesday, the dollar traded around 112.16 yen. reuters://realtime/verb=Open/url=cpurl://apps.cp./Apps/fx-polls?RIC=JPY= Boj Exit Strategy on Long Horizon The Nikkei broke through the 20,000-point barrier in early June for the first time since December 2015.  Last week, the Nikkei hit its highest level since August 2015, in large part as Japanese companies continue to expect better earnings for the current fiscal year. While market observers expect more Nikkei gains in the near and medium-term, in the longer term, they note the risk around how the Bank of Japan may start communicating its exit strategy from ultra-easy policy without causing market turmoil.  Economists polled by Reuters earlier this month were divided on what the BOJ should do. BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda's term is set to end in April 2018 but he is still far from his goals. The U.S. central bank is raising rates and policymakers at the European Central Bank are debating tapering their monthly asset purchases.  Ultra-loose policy will likely continue at least until April, but it will end eventually,  said Norihiro Fujito, senior investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities. He says the Nikkei could correct and trade at 19,000 by end-2018.

While most major world stock indexes are forecast to continue rising in the latest global survey covering 22 indexes taken June 19-28, a clear outperformance is expected in emerging markets, and particularly in Asia.  Within emerging market equities, Asia remains our preferred region,  William Hobbs, head of investment strategy at Barclays, said in a note to clients. On a strategic basis, he sees South Korea, Taiwan and China offshore as the  highest conviction  bets in Asia. According to the Reuters poll, Asian stock market indexes expected to perform the best from now until the end of the year are those in India, China, South Korea, Japan and Australia.  In terms of full calendar year gains, India is forecast to be in the lead, followed by Japan, South Korea, Australia and China.  Much, of course, will depend on trade and increasingly, the U.S. administration's approach to it.  With the region's earnings sensitive to the trade cycle, what President Trump decides to implement in regards to trade policy is important,  Hobbs wrote. Trump is unhappy with China over its inaction on North Korea, according to administration officials, and is considering options including tariffs on steel imports. But it is unclear whether he will take any action. In the meantime, central banks in Australia and India have switched to a neutral monetary policy while China is showing signs it may gradually tighten more this year as it looks to reduce risks in the financial system. China's yuan has strengthened more than 2 percent so far in 2017, even as the People's Bank of China moved aggressively in May to flush out speculative bets, and has already nudged up short-term and money market rates several times this year. But with the Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank still engaged in large-scale asset purchases, there is still plenty of cash swirling around in the financial system looking to find a home and stocks are the asset class of choice for global investors still searching for yield.  Having risen over 2 percent since the start of this year, the Shanghai Composite Index is expected to gain another 4 percent in the next six months to reach 3,300. It will rise to 3,325 by the end of June 2018. Those predictions were slightly weaker from those just three months ago. - South Korea's Kospi, which has risen about 18 percent so far in 2017, is expected to continue climbing, although more slowly, reaching 2,473 by year-end, up almost 4 percent from Wednesday. It will close at 2,530 at end-June 2018, stronger than March's forecast, according to the poll. - Hong Kong's Hang Seng index to rise over 2 percent to 26,250 by the end of the year from Wednesday's close of 25,683.50. This projection is slightly weaker than estimates three months ago.  - Taiwan's benchmark stock index, which is up about 13 percent this year, is expected to fall to 10,000 by the end of the year, down nearly 4 percent from Wednesday's close.  - Japan remains the only major economy in the region which still has an ultra-loose monetary policy. But the Nikkei is only expected to rise another 3 percent by end-year.    - Australian shares will edge up over the remainder of the year but India's benchmark BSE Sensex will reach a record high, the latest poll shows.

Founded in 1963 by Bruce McLaren and known for winning Formula 1 titles with drivers such as Lewis Hamilton, McLaren set up a separate sports car maker known as McLaren Automotive in 2010 to rival the likes of Ferrari and Aston Martin. Since then the firm has grown rapidly, with sales doubling to 3,286 vehicles in 2016 and profit rising by 70 percent to 9.2 million pounds ($12 million).  The carmaker said earlier this year it would create 200 jobs as part of a 50 million pounds investment to build carbon-fibre chassis in northern England, its first purpose-built site away from its headquarters in the southern English town of Woking.  With a range of new models expected to drive further growth, the firm's director for sales and marketing said he expected another all-time high this year.

Soaring property prices have pushed up rents and had a knock-on effect as businesses raise prices on goods and services, forcing people like Lau to find extra work.  You have to work yourself to death. If you don't work and work, you can't cover living costs,  Lau said at her food stall in a city wet market.  The situation in Hong Kong is terrible,  she said. Income inequality has reached its highest level in more than four decades, according to government data, as a red-hot property market squeezes the city's most vulnerable people and risks fuelling social tensions.    The city of 7.3 million people has the world's third largest concentration of individuals worth more than $30 million, behind London and number one New York, according to a global wealth report by real estate consultancy Knight Frank.   Hong Kong had 4,080 ultra high-net worth individuals in 2016, the report said, but mainland China has more than three times that number and many of them have bought property in the territory. Despite government efforts to alleviate poverty, the city remains among the most inequitable in the world, said charity Oxfam, citing recent census data. The wealthiest 10 percent of households earn nearly 44 times more than the poorest 10 percent who make an average of HK$2,560 ($328.20) per month, according to a 2016 household income report published by the Census and Statistics Dept this month. Hong Kong's Gini coefficient for household income - a widely used measure of income disparity - rose to 0.539 last year on a scale from zero to one, the highest rating recorded in over four decades. Zero represents equality. Singapore, another Asian financial hub, saw its coefficient fall to 0.458 in 2016, the lowest in a decade. The United States recorded a figure of 0.394 in 2014, while the United Kingdom came in at 0.358 in 2013, according to the OECD.

An apartment of less than 200 square feet can cost as much as $500,000 in Hong Kong, where home prices have surged more than 137 percent since the financial crisis in 2008, propelled by a supply shortage, low interest rates, and big flows of money from the mainland.

Many poor and elderly can only afford to live in small cubicles or subdivided flats, said Kalina Tsang, senior manager for Ofxam in Hong Kong.  One of the most urgent things for the new government to do is increase the public rental protection housing in Hong Kong so that poor people can have a decent living,  Tsang said. Hong Kong-leader elect Carrie Lam, who takes over on July 1, has said she is  very determined  to tackle the high cost of housing, which helped fuel pro-democracy protests in 2014. Hong Kong Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung, the city's former commissioner for poverty, said the government has a plan to free up land for public and private housing over the next 10 years.  Property prices have always been a problem and still remain a problem that we need to tackle,  he said.

Then it becomes clear it's about Gaza and the future of the impoverished and fenced-in Palestinian enclave. Israel's intelligence and transport minister has long pushed the idea of an artificial island off the coast of the Gaza Strip, with plans for a port, cargo terminal and even an airport to boost the territory's economy and connect it to the world. But now the minister, Israel Katz, has released a slick, high-production video setting out his proposal in more detail, complete with a dramatic, English-speaking narration, colorful graphics and stirring music. [ Video here: here ]  The artificial island initiative is aimed at providing an answer to a reality that is bad for the Palestinians and not good for Israel,  says the narrator, acknowledging that the aim is in part to change the view that Israel is to blame for the deteriorating circumstances of Gaza's two million people. The Islamist militant group Hamas has controlled Gaza for the past decade, during which time Israel and neighboring Egypt have maintained a tight blockade, restricting the flow of goods and people in and out, in part to pressure Hamas.  While Israel withdrew its soldiers and settlers in 2005, it still limits Gaza's access to the sea and controls its airspace.  Today, Israel continues to be perceived as being responsible for the Gaza Strip and is to a large extent the only lifeline to it, even though it withdrew from the strip over a decade ago,  says the narrator. To challenge that perception, and tackle the broader humanitarian and economic problems that beset Gaza - it is currently receiving less than three hours of electricity a day and has unemployment exceeding 40 percent - Katz's plan calls for a $5 billion investment over five years. It envisages an international consortium building the 1,300-acre island (525 hectares) some three miles offshore, connecting it to the mainland via a causeway, which would have a bridge in the middle that could be raised, cutting off access.  A still image taken from handout video supplied by the Israeli ministry of intelligence and transportation shows animation of an artificial island off the coast of Gaza. via REUTERSHamas, which has fought three wars with Israel since it seized control of Gaza from the rival Palestinian movement Fatah, has long called for a sea port and wants the airport in Gaza, destroyed by Israel in 2001, rebuilt.  It has not commented directly on Katz's island plan, but Sami Abu Zuhri, a spokesman for the group, said:  Building a sea port for Gaza is a right of its people to alleviate their suffering and end the blockade.  Gas, Water Works Slideshow (3 Images)The projected island would hold vast infrastructure, including cargo and passenger ports, a marina, gas and electricity terminals, a desalination plant and space for an airport in the future.  While Israel would retain control of security in the sea around the island, and would carry out inspections at the port, an international policing force would be responsible for security on the island and at checkpoints on the bridge.  In addition to its humanitarian and economic importance, and distinct security advantages, the artificial island initiative will strengthen the cooperation and relations between Israel and the countries in the region,  says the video. While at one level the idea sounds pie-in-the-sky, Katz has presented it internationally and raised it consistently for discussion. He showed his video to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's cabinet this month, where it met with widespread approval, according to Katz's spokesman.  But Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman, who has responsibility for Gaza policy, remains unconvinced and has not endorsed the proposal. He has said Gaza does not deserve any development project as long as Hamas runs the territory. Katz's hope is that if the Israeli government does get fully behind it, it can then be presented to international partners as a potential, if ambitious, project to finance.

A Reuters poll conducted before the release of the regional data suggested EU-harmonized consumer price inflation fell to 1.3 percent in June from 1.4 percent in May. Capital Economics analyst Jennifer McKeown said the state readings now suggested that German inflation edged up in June to 1.5 percent, adding that price pressure would rise further in the coming months due to the robust German labor market.  This will offer some comfort to the ECB, which has stressed that a sustained increase in underlying inflation is a key condition for policy normalization to begin,  she added.

Chinese Defense Ministry spokesman Wu Qian was asked at a regular monthly news briefing if China would build a naval base in the Chinese-invested Pakistani port city of Gwadar.  Talk that China is building a military base in Pakistan is pure guesswork,  Wu said, without elaborating. Djibouti's position on the northwestern edge of the Indian Ocean has fueled worries in India that it would become another of China's  string of pearls  of military alliances and assets ringing India, including Pakistan, Bangladesh, Myanmar and Sri Lanka. China has repeatedly downplayed expectations it could be about to embark on a plan to build military bases around the world, even as it ramps up an impressive military modernization program.

Shares in Eris, whose portfolio includes drugs that treat diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular diseases, was down 0.45 percent at 600.30 rupees by 0932 GMT on the National Stock Exchange. The stock touched a low of 594.30 rupees, compared with its IPO price of 603 rupees. It earlier gained as much as 4.1 percent. Although the company's operating profit surged 56.6 percent to 2.7 billion rupees ($41.8 million) in the year ended in March from the previous year, some analysts expressed concerns about the growth prospects of its key brands and its ability to expand to new segments. Emkay, a domestic brokerage, warned Eris could see  a number of key brands seeing growth taper off in their overall segments,  while noting its outlook would depend on its ability to sustain earnings growth  by identifying new segments and therapies.  Eris IPO was subscribed more than three times on the last day of the sale on June 20. Some analysts said Eris would likely prove a winning bet given it primarily caters to the domestic market, at a time when some drugmakers are facing increased regulatory scrutiny in overseas markets. The drugmaker is also expected to capitalise on increased demand for treatments for lifestyle diseases such as diabetes.

South Australia bond yields have risen relative to those of other states since it imposed a A$370 million ($280 million) levy on the country's five biggest lenders, indicating investors have become more cautious about lending to the state government.  We will sell some (more) because we are a bit concerned about the risk profile,  Shayne Elliott told FiveAA radio. The state announced its tax a month after the federal government said it would impose a new A$6.2 billion tax on the big five. The federal government said it needed to raise revenue from profitable banks to help narrow a budget deficit, while South Australia said its tax would fund job-creation initiatives. But the banks - ANZ, National Australia Bank Ltd, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Westpac Banking Corp and Macquarie Group Ltd - said the taxes came as a surprise and would deter potential foreign investment. Elliott said ANZ holds about $2 billion of South Australia bonds, and would consider selling more should there be increased risk of a rise in the state's borrowing costs - as would be the case if other banks also sold South Australia bonds. Elliot earlier this week called South Australia's tax  immoral . In a late Wednesday tweet, he said that was  a poor choice of words  which he replaced with  unfair . Westpac subsidiary Bank SA described the tax as bad public and economic policy, and postponed the establishment of a new team in South Australia. The state's opposition Liberal Party will decide next week whether to join minor party cross-benchers to block the tax legislation. Party leader Steven Marshall met senior ANZ executives on Tuesday but has yet to make a decision.

DS Smith's stock rose 9.8 percent at 487.8 pence to a record high, making it the largest gainer on the FTSE Midcap Index.  The company, which makes corrugated trays, soft plastic containers, transport packaging and display cases, also said it would fund part of the deal by raising about 285 million pounds through an underwritten placing of new shares at 10 pence each. DS Smith, which has the option to buy the remaining 20 percent from Merpas Co over five years, will take on $226 million of the family-owned business' debt. The deal will immediately add to earnings, the company, which made five bolt-on acquisitions for 85 million pounds in the year ended April, said.  The U.S. market will allow DS Smith to grow its packaging business, specially in retail ready e-commerce and performance packaging solutions, CEO Miles Roberts said on a media call.  Our customers including Mondelez (MDLZ.O) and Nestle (NESN.S) want us to enter this (U.S.) market to support them. Seventeen of our top 20 pan-European customers have significant U.S. operations,  he said.   Packaging has never been more relevant to our customers. Our customers are those big FMCG companies who are really looking to engage more with their customers... they say, 'can you also help us in other markets, can you help us in the U.S.?'  The company's customers had  rewarded  DS Smith with work in Europe, Roberts added. The region accounts for the bulk of the firm's revenue. DS Smith operates in a challenging volume growth environment for European fast-moving consumer goods operators, competing with Smurfit Kappa (SKG.I), Mondi (MNDI.L) and RPC Group (RPC.L).   Roberts said the deal, the second-largest ever for DS Smith, was not a diversification acquisition, protecting DS Smith from other headwinds in the UK.   DS Smith wanted to focus on America's east coast and approached a number of potential targets until it began talks with Interstate Resources, which operates 19 production sites in the U.S. and reported revenue of $618 million in 2016. The company, which was founded in 1940 as a box-making businesses in East London, also reported a 31 percent jump in full-year pretax profit to 264 million pounds ($342 million), driven by acquisitions and demand from its European customers.

The Nigerian military cracked down heavily on local opposition to oil production by a Shell joint venture in the Niger Delta in the early 1990s. The four widows allege that Shell provided support to the military in the crackdown that ultimately led to the executions of the men, known as the Ogoni 9. Shell, the largest oil producer in Nigeria, has repeatedly denied any involvement in the executions or the government's response to the unrest.  We have always denied, in the strongest possible terms, the allegations made by the plaintiffs in this tragic case,  Shell said in a statement.   SPDC (Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria) did not collude with the authorities to suppress community unrest and in no way encouraged or advocated any act of violence in Nigeria. In fact, the company believes that dialogue is the best way to resolve disputes.  A Shell logo is seen reflected in a car's side mirror at a petrol station in west London, Britain, January 29, 2015. Picture taken January 29, 2015.Toby Melville/File PhotoIn 2009, Shell agreed in an out-of-court settlement in the United States to pay $15.5 million in damages to a group of relatives of the nine.  The four widows' civil case was filed by human rights lawfirm Prakken d'Oliveira with the support of Amnesty International on behalf of Esther Kiobel, Victoria Bera, Blessing Eawo and Charity Levula. The writ did not specify how much compensation they were seeking. FILE PHOTO: A warning sign belonging to the company Royal Dutch Shell is seen along the Nembe creek in Nigeria's oil state of Bayelsa December 2, 2012.Akintunde Akinleye/File photo Shell and the military regime formed an alliance in the events leading to the deaths of the Ogoni 9,  the writ said.   Their relationship was one of mutual dependence: the Nigerian state was dependent on the income from oil that Shell generated; in turn, Shell was dependent on the benevolence and protection of the regime to pursue its activities in Nigeria and in this way realize a substantial part of its turnover.  Kiobel previously took a lawsuit to the United States but the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2013 that the case could not be heard because the country did not have jurisdiction.  A number of groups have pursued in recent years cases against Shell in courts in the United Kingdom, the United States and the Netherlands over claims related oil spills and environmental damage, claiming they cannot get a fair hearing in Nigeria.

Babis's ANO party, which holds a double-digit lead in polls, unveiled its tax plans for the autumn campaign on Thursday and said it would not propose any corporate tax changes and was opposed to new taxes on banks. The party is part of a three-member coalition led by Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka's Social Democrats, who have laid out their own plans to make up ground in polls by offering tax cuts for workers and introducing taxes on banks' assets.  What we are pushing is a stable and predictable tax environment,  Babis said. Social Democrats have previously sought sector taxes on banks but ran into opposition from ANO. Babis said the party would not agree with such a step as it would end up impacting people and companies.  If some sector tax on banks was implemented, then these banks would pass it on to customers, citizens, firms and it would have no effect,  he said. Bank shares in Prague were steady on Thursday, with Komercni Banka, the country's third biggest lender, and Moneta Money Bank up a touch. Sobotka dismissed Babis from the government in May although their dispute over allegations of tax dodging - which the businessman denies - has done little to hurt ANO's popularity. Babis, the country's second richest businessman who is against joining the euro currency club, founded the party in 2011. It soared to second place in the last election on pledges to fight corruption and run the state in business-like fashion. Although the government has presided over a growing economy that helped it deliver the first balanced budget in two decades, the Social Democrats have slipped in the polls behind ANO. ANO's lead of 12-20 percentage points depending on the poll gives Babis a strong chance of leading the next ruling coalition, although some parties have ruled out joining an ANO-led government.

If implemented, the changes could throw tax collection into disarray in Romania, whose public administration is among the weakest in the EU, plagued by vague legislation, bureaucracy and corruption. The tax changes would probably lead to less revenues for the state and bring unpredictability to the business environment in Romania as the plans had not been discussed with economic players, analysts said. Romanian stocks under-performed the region after the tax plans were unveiled. Designated Prime Minister Mihai Tudose will ask for parliament’s vote of confidence later on Thursday, which he is likely to receive given the comfortable parliamentary majority held by the ruling Social Democrat Party (PSD) and its junior partner ALDE. The ruling coalition toppled its own cabinet in a no- confidence motion last week, accusing their prime minister Sorin Grindeanu of failing to implement the ambitious governing programme that helped them win a December election. A majority of ministers from the ousted cabinet feature in the new government, including Tudose. PSD leader Liviu Dragnea said the programme had been re-worked to make up for delays. Former Finance Minister Darius Valcov, currently on trial for taking bribes and using the funds to buy art which he stashed away, is the programme's author. The tax overhaul includes changing the flat tax on income and profit, scrapping a dividend tax, cutting social security contributions, granting deductions to some categories, and additional levies for oil and gas companies. Loose fiscal plans have worried the European Commission and the International Monetary Fund over missing budget targets. The Commission expects Romania to run the EU's largest deficits this year and next at 3.5 percent and 3.7 percent of GDP. The plans also mention introducing a  solidarity contribution  from 2018, without elaborating. The programme does not include an impact assessment. It plans to replace the corporate tax on profit with a multi-levelled levy on turnover. Income tax would fall to 10 percent, but revenue of less than 2,000 lei ($502.29) per month will not be taxed. Social security contributions will be cut by 4.25 percentage points to 35 percent but they will be paid solely by workers, not their employers. Fiscal worries are likely to weigh on the leu currency, which fell to a five-year low this month but was flat on the day at 0830 GMT.

Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), said the study was an ambitious project that applied lessons from the 2007-09 financial crisis when Northern Rock collapsed because of an unsustainable business model. The study comes at a time the government is trying to boost competition in a sector dominated by the  Big Four , HSBC , Lloyds, Royal Bank of Scotland and Barclays. Bailey said 16 new banks had been approved over the last five years and 38 were considering seeking authorisation.  My hope is that we can lay out a body of evidence from which conclusions can start to be drawn,  Bailey told a British Bankers' Association (BBA) conference on Thursday.  But, let me manage expectations. We expect to be working hard for the rest of this year and into the first two quarters of next year to get the evidence laid out.  The study will start off focusing on links between different products and services and their relative profitability in an environment were fewer customers are visiting bank branches, preferring to access accounts over the phone.  It should enable us to assess better the impact of changes – for instance in technology – on retail banking business models,  Bailey said. BBA Chief Executive Anthony Browne told the conference that retail banking was changing more than ever before, with apps now the most popular way to access accounts.  There is a consumer-led revolution underway in the way we access and manage our money,  Browne said. Bailey said the FCA will publish its findings over the summer from a review of so-called high-cost credit including overdrafts after lawmakers criticised banks for charging hefty fees for people who get overdrawn.  We will then be able to decide if we need to intervene further,  Bailey said. The outcome of a third piece of work will be published by the regulator soon - a review of how banks assess customers' understanding of products and services. There have also been calls for banks to end free banking for those in credit as lawmakers say it means other services, such as overdrafts, are more expensive than they should be and hit the less well off hardest.  So, as they say, let me be clear. I do not advocate ending free-if-in-credit banking. Why? Because there is no such thing to start with, so it cannot be abolished as such,  Bailey said. He said free-if-in-credit just meant that some customers pay more or less than others depending on what products they use.

DS Smith's stock rose 9.8 percent at 487.8 pence to a record high, making it the largest gainer on the FTSE Midcap Index.  The company, which makes corrugated trays, soft plastic containers, transport packaging and display cases, also said it would fund part of the deal by raising about 285 million pounds through an underwritten placing of new shares at 10 pence each. DS Smith, which has the option to buy the remaining 20 percent from Merpas Co over five years, will take on $226 million of the family-owned business' debt. The deal will immediately add to earnings, the company, which made five bolt-on acquisitions for 85 million pounds in the year ended April, said.  The U.S. market will allow DS Smith to grow its packaging business, specially in retail ready e-commerce and performance packaging solutions, CEO Miles Roberts said on a media call.  Our customers including Mondelez (MDLZ.O) and Nestle (NESN.S) want us to enter this (U.S.) market to support them. Seventeen of our top 20 pan-European customers have significant U.S. operations,  he said.   Packaging has never been more relevant to our customers. Our customers are those big FMCG companies who are really looking to engage more with their customers... they say, 'can you also help us in other markets, can you help us in the U.S.?'  The company's customers had  rewarded  DS Smith with work in Europe, Roberts added. The region accounts for the bulk of the firm's revenue. DS Smith operates in a challenging volume growth environment for European fast-moving consumer goods operators, competing with Smurfit Kappa (SKG.I), Mondi (MNDI.L) and RPC Group (RPC.L).   Roberts said the deal, the second-largest ever for DS Smith, was not a diversification acquisition, protecting DS Smith from other headwinds in the UK.   DS Smith wanted to focus on America's east coast and approached a number of potential targets until it began talks with Interstate Resources, which operates 19 production sites in the U.S. and reported revenue of $618 million in 2016.

The $380 million plant in Newberry County, South Carolina, will produce washing machines and other appliances from early next year and create nearly 1,000 jobs by 2020, the South Korean tech giant said. The move, the latest in a long line of global companies reacting to pressure from Trump to create more U.S. jobs, has prompted expressions of goodwill between the two nations ahead of the visit. U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross on Wednesday called the investment  great news , while Trump himself tweeted in February after Samsung said it was considering such an investment:  Thank you, @Samsung! We would love to have you! . But Moon, who will be accompanied by more than 50 South Korean business leaders, is also expected to face pressure to address his country's large trade surplus with the United States. Samsung's investment news was followed up by a statement from South Korea's biggest business lobby that 52 companies plan to invest a total of $12.8 billion in the United States over the next five years. Much of that has already been previously announced and it was not immediately clear how much was new. Whirlpool Threat FILE PHOTO: The logo of Samsung Electronics is seen in Seoul, South Korea, July 4, 2016.Kim Hong-Ji/File PhotoSamsung is the biggest manufacturer of large appliances in the United States with market share of around 19 percent, according to researcher Traqline. But it hasn't had a U.S.  appliances plant since the early 1990s when it closed a TV factory. The investment falls into line with Samsung's strategy of boosting high-end home appliance product sales in the United States. Last year it acquired U.S.-based luxury appliances maker Dacor Inc. It may also give Samsung more flexibility in production decisions as it grapples with a complaint by Whirlpool Corp. Its rival has asked a U.S. government trade panel for stronger protections against imported washing machines made by Samsung and LG Electronics. Whirlpool argues the South Korean firms have skirted Commerce Department anti-dumping orders for years by shifting production to various countries. A decision on its petition is expected in September. Samsung's new plant will allow it to increase its speed of delivery to customers for appliances  that reflect the regional preferences of our fastest-growing and most important consumer market,  Samsung Electronics Chief Executive B.K. Yoon said in a statement. U.S. capital spending plans by other South Korean companies include an announcement by Hyundai Motor and its affiliates in January that they will boost investment by 50 percent to $3.1 billion over five years. The automaker has also said it may build a new plant there. LG Electronics Inc said in March it plans to build a $250 million home appliance factory in Tennessee employing 600 workers. South Korea also plans to purchase $22.4 billion worth of U.S. liquefied natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas and other U.S. goods, the Korean Chamber of Commerce & Industry said.

Suu, which means milk in Mongolian, sold 6 billion tugrik ($2.55 million) of debt as it aims to boost production and refinance dollar-denominated debt accumulated during the country's short-lived economic boom. The one-year bills have an annual interest rate of 17.5 percent. Investors were drawn to the bond because of the stability brought to the local currency, the tugrik, following a $5.5 billion rescue package from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), said Dashdorj Bilguun, who worked on the underwriting at Golomt Capital.  It stabilises the currency,  said Bilguun of the IMF deal. The tugrik was in free fall last year, declining by nearly a quarter as a result of falling investment and weak Chinese demand for commodities. Coal and copper sold to China were leading drivers of Mongolian growth, but the IMF is now encouraging the landlocked Asian nation to diversify and develop agriculture and tourism in order to protect it from boom-bust cycles. Suu is eyeing China as a potential customer for its dairy products, but Mongolian agriculture remains underdeveloped because of a lack of infrastructure and the remote location of herders. About 30 percent of Mongolia's population still practices a traditional nomadic livelihood that can be traced back to the 13th century, when Genghis Khan was building history's largest empire. Bilguun said the bills were 12.6 percent oversubscribed despite investor concerns about the potential victory of presidential candidate Khaltmaa Battulga from the opposition Democratic Party, who won the most votes in an inconclusive first round of elections this week. Before the election, Battulga was calling for more state control in mining, including the Oyu Tolgoi copper-gold mine run by Rio Tinto. Shares in Mongolia-based firms plunged this week after the election, with Turquoise Hill Resources and Aspire Mining falling by around 5 percent and the Mongolian Mining Corp losing 14 percent since Monday. An analyst with a Hong Kong investment firm familiar with Thursday's bond deal said the government had turned a corner after the IMF agreement was secured.  The atmosphere has changed,  said the analyst, who asked not to be named because he was not authorised to speak to the media.  There will still be pains, but hopefully the worst has passed.

CRISIL said it bought the stake from Canara Bank Ltd (CNBK.NS). The investment comes as corporate bond issuance done through private placements jumped 42.9 percent to 7 trillion rupees in the year ended in March from the previous year.  The company said India's ratings sector would continue to benefit from increased issuances of bonds and loans because of rising capital investments and infrastructure financing.

CARE is the only of India's four major ratings agencies to be independently owned, with no affiliation to S&P;, Moody's Investor Service, or Fitch Ratings. Although rating agencies have benefitted from corporate bond issuances, the sector is also facing increased scrutiny from market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India over concerns they took belated action in a slew of recent corporate bond defaults.

Washington is investigating aluminum imports from China under the rarely used section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 that allows restrictions on imports for reasons of national security. The administration is also conducting a separate investigation into steel.  The scale of 'national security' is very wide and lacking clear definition, which is easily misused and therefore posing restrictions on normal flow of international trade,  Sun Jiwen, spokesman at China's Commerce Ministry, said at a weekly briefing. His comments come after senior officials told Reuters that U.S. President Donald Trump is growing increasingly frustrated with China over its inaction on North Korea and bilateral trade issues and is now considering possible trade actions against Beijing.    It is inevitable to have some friction as the bilateral trade between China and U.S. is massive,  Sun said.   Generally the cooperation between China and the U.S. goes smoothly and has achieved many positive results. China will continue making effort on it, and hope the U.S. can also work toward the same direction,  said Sun.  In April, Beijing and Washington agreed to a 100-day plan for trade talks in a bid to boost access to each other's markets.

The three attackers rammed a hired van into pedestrians on the bridge late on June 3 before going on the rampage through the bustling Borough Market area, where they slit throats and stabbed people, killing eight. Police Constable Wayne Marques said he had heard screams coming from London Bridge and when he went to investigate saw people being attacked. Armed with only his baton, the 38-year-old officer launched himself at the men who were wearing fake suicide belts.  I take a deep breath and I charge in. I try to take the first one out in one go, I swing as hard as I can, everything behind it, aiming straight for his head,  said Marques, who works for the British Transport Police. The attacker managed to get his hand up and block the blow.  I still managed to get a good hit on him. I heard him yelp in pain,  Marques told the BBC. British Transport Police officer Wayne Marques, who fought off London Bridge attackers, speaks to the media for the first time, in London, Britain June 28, 2017. Picture taken June 28, 2017.John Stillwell/PoolHe said he was overpowering the first man when he felt a  massive whack  to the side of his head. He had been stabbed and lost the vision in his right eye.  I'm stumbling .. and I manage to look up and to see a knife coming up at me. Instincts more than anything ... I just put my hand out and blocked his wrist with my baton.  Despite his injuries, he tried to fight all three men, swinging his baton wildly, receiving another stab wound to his leg in the process. Finally he got some distance between himself and the men, who he remembers were staring at him with one saying  Allahu akbar  (God is greatest). Slideshow (2 Images)However, rather than rush him again, they moved away into Borough Market to continue their rampage, which was the third deadly attack by Islamists in Britain in three months.  Either I was taking up too much time or they couldn't figure me out or they were waiting for me to pass out with blood loss and then finish me off, you're guess is as good as mine,  he said. He estimated he spent about 90 seconds fighting the men. Police say it took from eight minutes from them receiving the first call about the incident until armed officers arrived at the scene and shot dead the three attackers.  Officers treated Marques at the scene and he needed hospital treatment after suffering major wounds to his head above his eye, his leg and hand.

The $380 million plant in Newberry County, South Carolina, will produce washing machines and other appliances from early next year and create nearly 1,000 jobs by 2020, the South Korean tech giant said. The move, the latest in a long line of global companies reacting to pressure from Trump to create more U.S. jobs, has prompted expressions of goodwill between the two nations ahead of the visit. U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross on Wednesday called the investment  great news , while Trump himself tweeted in February after Samsung said it was considering such an investment:  Thank you, @Samsung! We would love to have you! . But Moon, who will be accompanied by more than 50 South Korean business leaders, is also expected to face pressure to address his country's large trade surplus with the United States. Samsung's investment news was followed up by a statement from South Korea's biggest business lobby that 52 companies plan to invest a total of $12.8 billion in the United States over the next five years. Much of that has already been previously announced and it was not immediately clear how much was new. Whirlpool Threat FILE PHOTO: The logo of Samsung Electronics is seen in Seoul, South Korea, July 4, 2016.Kim Hong-Ji/File PhotoSamsung is the biggest manufacturer of large appliances in the United States with market share of around 19 percent, according to researcher Traqline. But it hasn't had a U.S.  appliances plant since the early 1990s when it closed a TV factory. The investment falls into line with Samsung's strategy of boosting high-end home appliance product sales in the United States. Last year it acquired U.S.-based luxury appliances maker Dacor Inc. It may also give Samsung more flexibility in production decisions as it grapples with a complaint by Whirlpool Corp. Its rival has asked a U.S. government trade panel for stronger protections against imported washing machines made by Samsung and LG Electronics. Whirlpool argues the South Korean firms have skirted Commerce Department anti-dumping orders for years by shifting production to various countries. A decision on its petition is expected in September. Samsung's new plant will allow it to increase its speed of delivery to customers for appliances  that reflect the regional preferences of our fastest-growing and most important consumer market,  Samsung Electronics Chief Executive B.K. Yoon said in a statement. U.S. capital spending plans by other South Korean companies include an announcement by Hyundai Motor and its affiliates in January that they will boost investment by 50 percent to $3.1 billion over five years. The automaker has also said it may build a new plant there. LG Electronics Inc said in March it plans to build a $250 million home appliance factory in Tennessee employing 600 workers. South Korea also plans to purchase $22.4 billion worth of U.S. liquefied natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas and other U.S. goods, the Korean Chamber of Commerce & Industry said.

NBG, Greece's second-largest bank by assets, is selling the unit as part of a restructuring plan approved by the European Union to exit non-banking operations and focus on core banking. Other Greek banks have been divesting assets and foreign subsidiaries. Eurobank has sold an 80 percent stake in its insurance unit Eurolife to Canada's Fairfax Financial Holdings for 316 million euros. EXIN said the agreed price implied an enterprise value of 958 million euros for the unit.  NBG will retain a 25 percent stake in Ethniki Insurance, which remains NBG's exclusive bancassurance provider under a new 10-year partnership agreement for life, savings and non-life insurance products.  EXIN said. EXIN Group was founded earlier this year with the backing of investor EXIN Partners and U.S. asset manager Calamos Investments, targeting reinsurance, wholesale and retail life insurance markets in Europe. Its first deal was the purchase of AIG's shares in AIG- Greece in December last year. EXIN said it shares a common ambition with NBG to develop Ethniki Insurance and substantially upgrade its core systems and processes to better serve customers. EXIN will contribute distribution, technical, underwriting and digital expertise to the partnership, including its proprietary application and algorithm-based predictive behaviour technology. UBS advised EXIN on the transaction. NBG's board approved the sale to the American-Dutch consortium on Wednesday and will seek shareholder approval on Friday at a scheduled general assembly. The bank said the sale would boost its core equity Tier 1 capital ratio by 110 basis points to 18.5 percent. It also agreed an exclusive deal in bancassurance under which NBG will distribute EXIN products via its network. NBG CEO Leonidas Fragiadakis said the bank was  implementing its commitment to European authorities and shareholders . Calamos-EXIN was competing against three interested Chinese groups interested in the unit: Fosun, Shanghai-based Gongbao and Wintime.  The deal reinforces our commitment to the southern European financial services market as part of our strategy. EXIN has the expertise to lead a renaissance for the industry across the region,  said Calamos Investments CEO John Koudounis. NBG was advised by Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs on the divestment.

Russia, the Syrian government's main backer in the country's civil war, warned that it would respond proportionately if the United States took pre-emptive measures against Syrian forces to stop what the White House says could be a planned chemical attack. The White House said on Monday it appeared the Syrian military was preparing to conduct a chemical weapons attack and said that Assad and his forces would  pay a heavy price  if it did so. The warning was based on intelligence that indicated preparations for such a strike were under way at Syria's Shayrat airfield, U.S. officials said.  It appears that they took the warning seriously,  Mattis said.  They didn't do it,  he told reporters flying with him to Brussels for a meeting of NATO defense ministers. He offered no evidence other than the fact that an attack had not taken place. Asked whether he believed Assad's forces had called off any such strike completely, Mattis said:  I think you better ask Assad about that.  Washington accused Syrian forces of using the Shayrat airfield for a chemical weapons attack in April. Syria denies this. The intelligence that prompted the administration’s warning to Syria this week was  far from conclusive,  said a U.S. official familiar with it.  It did not come close to saying that a chemical weapons attack was coming,  the official said.      The intelligence consisted of a Syrian warplane being observed moving into a hangar at the Shayrat airbase, where U.S. and allied intelligence agencies suspect the Assad government is hiding chemical weapons, said a second U.S. official. Mattis said Syria's chemical weapons threat was larger than any single location.  I think that Assad's chemical program goes far beyond one airfield,  he said.     U.S. and allied intelligence officers had for some time identified several sites where they suspected Assad's government  may have been hiding newly made chemical weapons from inspectors, another U.S. official familiar with the intelligence said. The United States launched cruise missile strikes on Shayrat in April in response to the deaths of 87 people in what Washington said was a poison gas attack in rebel-held territory.             U.S. Secretary of Defence, Jim Mattis, walks away from Australia's Defence Minister Marise Payne after shaking her hand upon arriving in Sydney, Australia, June 4, 2017.David GrayThe Syrian government did not comment on the White House warning, although state-run al-Ikhbariya television station said the allegations were fabricated.     Russia Warning Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Wednesday that Moscow will respond if the United States takes measures against Syrian government forces.  We will react with dignity, in proportion to the real situation that may take place,  he said at a news conference in the city of Krasnodar. Lavrov said he hoped the United States was not preparing to use its intelligence assessments about the Syrian government's intentions as a pretext to mount a  provocation  in Syria.     Russian officials have described the war in Syria as the biggest source of tension between Moscow and Washington and say the April cruise missile strike ordered by U.S. President Donald Trump raised the risk of confrontation between them. In Washington, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, credited Trump with saving Syrian lives.  Due to the president's actions, we did not see an incident,  Haley told U.S. lawmakers.  I would like to think that the president saved many innocent men, women and children.   Although the number of people killed in suspected chemical attacks is a small portion of the total dead in Syria's civil war, estimated at close to half a million, footage of victims writhing in agony has caused particular revulsion.             On the Syrian battlefields, Turkish artillery bombarded and destroyed Kurdish YPG militia targets after the group's fighters opened fire on Turkish-backed forces in northern Syria. The United States supports the YPG in the fight against Islamic State in Syria, while NATO ally Turkey regards them as terrorists indistinguishable from Kurdish militants carrying out an insurgency in southeast Turkey. The Turkish army said YPG machinegun fire on Tuesday evening targeted Turkish-backed Free Syrian Army rebels south of the town of Azaz. Artillery struck back in retaliation, a Turkish military statement said. The boom of artillery fire could be heard overnight from the Turkish border town of Kilis, broadcaster Haberturk said. Ankara was angered by a U.S. decision in June to arm the YPG in the battle for Islamic State's stronghold of Raqqa.

Tesco and the wholesaler Booker announced the cash and shares deal in January and the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) formally started its initial Phase 1 review on May 30.  The CMA is assessing whether the deal could reduce competition and choice for shoppers and other customers, such as stores currently supplied by Booker. The initial investigation  was due to run until July 25.  We have now requested that the CMA uses the fast track process to allow it to move more quickly to examining the merger through a detailed Phase 2 process,  the companies said. They said they expect the CMA to issue a decision to refer to Phase 2 within the next two weeks. The transaction will be cleared if that inquiry, which lasts up to 24 weeks, does not find it will reduce competition. If competition is seen to be affected, the CMA can either seek remedies or block the deal.

CRISIL said it bought the stake from Canara Bank Ltd (CNBK.NS). The investment comes as corporate bond issuance done through private placements jumped 42.9 percent to 7 trillion rupees in the year ended in March from the previous year.  The company said India's ratings sector would continue to benefit from increased issuances of bonds and loans because of rising capital investments and infrastructure financing.

CARE is the only of India's four major ratings agencies to be independently owned, with no affiliation to S&P;, Moody's Investor Service, or Fitch Ratings.

Washington is investigating aluminum imports from China under the rarely used section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 that allows restrictions on imports for reasons of national security. The administration is also conducting a separate investigation into steel.  The scale of 'national security' is very wide and lacking clear definition, which is easily misused and therefore posing restrictions on normal flow of international trade,  Sun Jiwen, spokesman at China's Commerce Ministry, said at a weekly briefing. His comments come after senior officials told Reuters that U.S. President Donald Trump is growing increasingly frustrated with China over its inaction on North Korea and bilateral trade issues and is now considering possible trade actions against Beijing.    It is inevitable to have some friction as the bilateral trade between China and U.S. is massive,  Sun said.   Generally the cooperation between China and the U.S. goes smoothly and has achieved many positive results. China will continue making effort on it, and hope the U.S. can also work toward the same direction,  said Sun.  In April, Beijing and Washington agreed to a 100-day plan for trade talks in a bid to boost access to each other's markets.  So far, the United States has accepted imports of cooked poultry from China and in turn, China has agreed to drop a 14-year ban on beef imports.

IKB announced the sale of its leasing division to investment funds managed by HPS Investment Partners on Thursday, part of a reorganisation that includes buying back a hybrid bond to prepare IKB for a new owner. The lender has received indicative offers from banks and Chinese bidders, the person said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Final bids are due by the middle of August. The sale price of the leasing unit was not disclosed but the source said it was bought for 210 million euros ($240 million). Lone Star declined to comment. Lone Star has made multiple attempts in recent months to sell the bank, which specialises in offering financial services to medium-sized German companies. IKB, which required several bailouts from the German state and development bank KfW when its investment vehicles ran into funding problems in 2007, was delisted last year. Following the rescues, IKB was taken over by KfW, which sold it to Lone Star in August 2008 for 137 million euros. By late 2012, IKB had returned all of the 12 billion euros in state guarantees it received from Germany's bank bailout fund. In 2014, Lone Star tried to find a buyer for the bank but the results from a European Central Bank stress test, which IKB barely passed, deterred buyers.

Fallon's comment exposed his  utter ignorance of naval science,  ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said, and dismissed Britain's HMS Queen Elizabeth carrier as  a convenient oversized target at sea .  When you saw that old, dilapidated Kuznetsov sailing through the Channel a few months ago, I think the Russians will have looked at this ship with a little bit of envy,  British media quoted Fallon as saying this week. Fallon was referring to Russia's Soviet-era Admiral Kuznetsov and comparing it to HMS Queen Elizabeth, Britain's most advanced and biggest warship which set out on its maiden voyage from its dock in Scotland on Monday.  These ecstatic statements ... about the supremacy of the beautiful exterior of the new aircraft carrier over the Russian aircraft-carrying cruiser Admiral Kuznetsov expose Fallon's utter ignorance of naval science,  Konashenkov said in a statement. Fallon unnerved Russia's military in January by dubbing the mammoth Russian cruiser  a ship of shame  as it passed through waters close to the English coast on its way back from bombing raids in Syria.  The British aircraft carrier is just a convenient oversized target at sea,  Konashenkov said. In contrast, Kuznetsov is armed with air defence and anti-submarine weapons, as well as with anti-ship Granit missiles, he added.  For that reason, it is in the interests of the British royal navy not to show off the 'beauty' of its aircraft carrier on the high seas any closer than a few hundred miles to its Russian 'distant relative',  he said. Kuznetsov underwent its first sea trials in 1989 and was commissioned in 1991. As Russia is striving to promote a more assertive foreign policy amid chilly ties with the West, it is also re-arming its army and the navy. Some experts at home and abroad say however that the Cold war-era Kuznetsov is absolete and Russia needs a new generation of aircraft carriers.

Shares in the world's largest foodmaker rose as much as 2 percent on Wednesday, close to the record high touched on Monday after the New York-based hedge fund disclosed a $3.5 billion stake and urged Nestle to buy back shares, set a target for margin growth and shed non-core assets including its stake in L'Oreal (OREP.PA). Investors did not have to wait long for a response, with Nestle announcing late on Tuesday that it would launch a 20 billion Swiss franc ($20.8 billion) share buyback program while leaving room for near-term acquisitions. Nestle also said it would continue adjusting its portfolio and assess opportunities to boost profit margins, stopping short of setting a firm target. It added that the measures were the result of a review instigated at the start of the year after Mark Schneider took over as chief executive.   The moves were welcomed by stakeholders large and small.  This is a new era for Nestle and I'm extremely positive on the prospects for internal and external growth,  said Carine Menache, who runs a Monaco investment firm that owns Nestle shares. She and UBS analysts said the buyback should lift earnings by 6 percent, while increased merger and acquisition (M&A;) activity could provide a further boost.   Nestle may have a poor track record for M&A;, but the new CEO, Schneider, is now in charge and he has a great track record,  she added.  Reaching a 19 percent operating margin, the midpoint of Third Point's recommendation, would lift earnings by another 8 percent, according to UBS, which said Nestle shares now offered the greatest opportunity for growth of all the European packaged goods companies it covers, bolstering its  buy  rating. Of Nestle's plan, which they described as  responsive but not reactionary  to Third Point, UBS said:  We think this sends a strong message to the markets - expect more to come.    Sector Convulsions The global packaged food sector is convulsing as its main players struggle with slowing growth, changing consumer habits and the growing influence of global investment firm 3G Capital. 3G's Kraft Heinz (KHC.O) launched a surprise $143 billion takeover bid for Unilever (ULVR.L) in February, sparking a deep review and new agenda at the target company. Many of the demands laid out in Third Point's letter echo the steps Unilever took in the wake of the Kraft bid.  Investors said the biggest omission from Nestle's response was any reference to its 25 billion euro ($28.4 billion) stake in L'Oreal, which dates back to 1974, when the French heiress Liliane Bettencourt sold a large part of her holding to Nestle. That omission and lack of a margin target means the announcement may not completely satisfy Third Point, which is controlled by billionaire investor Daniel Loeb. Third Point has declined to comment on the announcement at this stage and Nestle is expected to say more at its investor day in September.  It's only a start,  said Mirabaud Asset Management's Nicolas Burki.  It will not be enough.  Nestle has long touted the L'Oreal stake as value-creating, and a source familiar with the company's thinking said there was no change to that view.    The big question, however is what Nestle would do with the cash, besides buybacks, if it sold down the L'Oreal stake. The company did say its capital spending would be focused on higher-growth categories of coffee, pet food, baby food and water. It added consumer health to the list of priorities, potentially making it a competitor to the likes of Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L). However, EFG Asset Management's Urs Beck cashed out of his Nestle position on Monday's price spike and is skeptical that it can find acquisitions big enough to move the needle for a company with $93 billion in sales.  The ship is just too big to be steered into different waters through portfolio management,  he said. Victory on Both Sides  Nestle is Europe's most valuable company, with a market value of $263 billion last week, before Loeb's position was made public, adding $10 billion in one day. The positive reaction most likely reflects the bullishness of long-term investors rather than event-driven hedge funds looking for quick turnarounds, says Michael Wegener at Case Equity Partners in Hong Kong.  Wegener said he doubts that many arbitrageurs have moved into Nestle's stock yet, since the Loeb stake remains too soft a catalyst at this stage.  But one London-based manager of an event-driven hedge fund with no involvement with Nestle described the situation as a  victory for both sides.   I suspect (Third Point's) presence actually helps Schneider with his change agenda,  said the manager, who asked not to be named.  I suspect the buyback is not enough, but Third Point is unlikely to feel the need to get shouty.    Swiss activist shareholder Rudolf Bohli said that Loeb, known for campaigns against Yahoo, Sony Corp and the Dow-DuPont merger, is on the right track.   Loeb has set the right tone and his agenda is correct,  said Bohli, who recently exited GAM Holding with a profit after failing to replace the financial company's chief executive.

And he was one of the lucky ones.  For weeks later, Solomon was back on two feet with the aid of an artificial leg, fitted at a hectic hospital cum limb-making factory in the South Sudanese capital of Juba. The hospital is in horribly high demand in a country born of war that remains littered with mines and explosive devices, with civil war still raging all around.  Most of South Sudan’s approximately 60,000 amputees have suffered war-related injuries, be it gunshot or landmine wounds. As civil war devastates the world’s youngest country - it celebrates its sixth anniversary next month - it has become increasingly difficult for amputees to gain good treatment.  Second Chance Solomon came to his first artificial limb after an open fracture turned into a life-threatening infection, which forced doctors to amputate.  When he woke from surgery in a remote hospital in South Sudan’s Bentiu, he was far away from the capital with little chance of rehabilitation or help adjusting to his new life.  ”I was put on a flight to Juba, where I am receiving a new, artificial leg,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation from his current home at the Physical Rehabilitation Reference Centre. It is the country’s biggest hospital for prosthetic orthotic treatment, treating about 30 patients a day. “Amputations have gone up since the beginning of the civil war in 2013, but even with increased need, access to some areas is impossible due to active fighting and many people who have lost limbs might never be able to get out and receive help,” said Emmanuel Lobari, who as head of technicians oversees the production of all the prosthetic limbs. Both hospital and factory, the center produces an average of 50 prostheses each month – all hand-made and custom fit. Durable, Affordable “We use polypropylene to make the limbs, a material that has proved to be both durable and affordable,” said physiotherapist Daniel Odhiambo.  A Kenyan, he is one of a handful of expatriate staff at the hospital, employed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).  “The prostheses last for an average of two years and it’s usually the foot, made out of a softer material, that wears out the fastest. The leg itself can last up to ten years.”  Physical therapist Daniel Odhiambo takes time to explain to Solomon how he will learn to use his new prosthetic limb at the Physical Rehabilitation and Reference Center in Juba, South Sudan, June 28, 2017. Thomson Reuters/Stefanie Glinski\nMaking a limb – from melting the plastic-like polypropylene to shaping it into a leg – is a quick process in the hospital’s small, modern factory and can all be done within a day.  “It’s the fitting and the patient’s adaption that take up to ten days,” said Lobari.  Lobari is South Sudanese, like most of the hospital’s 30 staff, all of whom received Red Cross training. The organization first started treating amputations in 1979 during Ethiopia’s civil war, and developed the polypropylene technology that has since spread across all conflict zones.  Odhiambo has worked in many places, including Afghanistan, Yemen and Iraq. He recently took up his second mission in Juba. “Here in South Sudan, I mainly see war wounds and they are very different from civilian wounds,” he explained.  Slideshow (6 Images)Nearly 250,000 mines and explosive devices were found and destroyed in South Sudan in 2017 alone, according to the United Nations Mine Action Service (UNMAS). South Sudan slipped into civil war in 2013, just two years after becoming independent from Khartoum, and some 4 million people – one third of the population – have fled to neighboring countries in its wake. For those left behind, risk is part of daily life. The worst case Odhiambo has seen is an 18-year-old boy, who was brought to the clinic with both legs blown off by a landmine, pieces of muscle hanging out of the wound and shrapnel fragments stuck deep in his flesh. “He was in consistent pain and it took months to build the right prosthesis, but I stayed with him through the whole process. I told him not to give up. He had his whole life ahead of him still.”  A Resilient Nation Simon has been coming to the hospital for several months and can still vividly recall the day he was attacked, when several bullets were shot through his leg.  “I thought I was going to die, but my family took me to a small hospital where my leg was amputated,” he said.  Simon is from the north of the country then moved to Juba to get better care. Three in four patients at the center are male. The women and children at the hospital underwent amputations after suffering a range of traumas, such as war injuries, crocodile bites, road accidents or infections. It helps patients such as Solomon - just starting a new life with his first prosthesis - to meet older patients like Simon. “The boy is still young, but he can see that he’s not alone with his injury,” said Odhiambo. “The one difference I’ve noted working in South Sudan is that people here accept their fate easier than any others. They are resilient and want to go on with their lives. I even see it in Solomon,” said Odhiambo. “People have suffered, but they don’t lose their drive and motivation.” Reporting by Stefanie Glinski.

Britain's major share index was up 0.5 percent, comparing favourably with euro zone stocks which turned lower after an upbeat start. British banks jumped 3 percent to a four-month high after the U.S. regulator approved higher dividends and buybacks, sending a ripple effect across financials worldwide. The Fed approved plans from all the 34 largest U.S. banks, including U.S. units of HSBC and Deutsche Bank, to use extra capital for stock buybacks and other purposes beyond a cushion against possible catastrophe. HSBC stole the show, up 4.8 percent to a near four-year high after a Morgan Stanley upgrade to 'overweight' added to enthusiasm over the U.S. regulator's approval. Analysts said they saw capital return rising up the agenda for the bank, with around $45 billion of surplus by 2019.  Our work suggests HSBC will be in the top quartile of EU banks for cash returns over the next three years,  said Morgan Stanley analysts.  HSBC's weighting towards Asia sets it apart from everything else that's listed here. I can see why there's potential for a split where people start looking at HSBC instead of Lloyds, who are far more exposed to Brexit risks,  said Gareth Burchell, partner at Shard Capital.  HSBC pays a very high dividend which is also attractive,  he added. Miners Anglo American, Glencore, BHP Billiton and Antofagasta underpinned robust gains, as copper and gold prices climbed against the weaker U.S. dollar. Meanwhile Royal Mail hit a two-month low, last down 3.1 percent at 414.6 pence.  We are buyers if the stock gets back towards 4 pounds,  said Burchell.  We're keen on what they've got in terms of real estate and how they are commercialising that.  Mid-caps also saw some robust company moves, with hefty losses from JD Sports sending the index down 0.1 percent. Packaging company DS Smith jumped as much as 9 percent, hitting an all-time high after reporting some upbeat full-year results and a planned $920 million acquisition of 80 percent of U.S. corrugated packaging firm Interstate Resources.  While the headline 16.8 times multiple of operating profit looks expensive, the deal is more reasonable post synergies,  said analysts at Davy Research. JD Sports sank 10 percent, set for its worst day in a year, after a trading update showed sales growth in line with expectations.  The muted tone of the statement could weigh on the share price in the near-term,  said George Mensah, analyst at Shore Capital. And value investor darling Purple Bricks gained 4.3 percent after reporting full-year revenue for the online real estate agency was up 151 percent.

But there is one crucial fight the oil-exporting group has been winning so far: its members have earned more money this year than last and the prospect of higher revenues is likely to motivate OPEC to stick with output cuts or even deepen them. OPEC's first output cut in eight years has earned the group $1.64 billion a day so far this year, up more than 10 percent from the second half of 2016, according to Reuters calculations based on OPEC figures for average production and its crude basket price up until June 20. Compared with the first half of 2016, when oil prices sank to a 12-year low near $27 a barrel, the increase in income is a dramatic 43 percent, even though production by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries was little changed. Income could rise in the rest of the year if, as OPEC hopes, a supply glut is banished. OPEC plus Russia and other non-OPEC producers agreed on May 25 to extend supply cuts to March, after an initial deal to keep them in place for the first half of 2017.  I expect the gains for OPEC to be higher during the second semester 2017 due to a tight market in the third and fourth quarter, despite an oversupply from non-OPEC not tied to the OPEC agreement and higher-than-expected production from Libya and Nigeria,  said Chakib Khelil, Algeria's former oil minister. He estimated OPEC revenues rose about 8 percent in the first half of 2017, following its move at the end of 2016 to cut overall output by about 4 percent.  The overall gain in revenues for OPEC would be in the 9 to 10 percent range for the whole of 2017 compared to 2016,  the former minister said. OPEC's decision in late 2016 to return to a policy of limiting supply, in cooperation with Russia and other non-members, marked the end of a two-year period in which the group pumped at will in a Saudi-led shift to curb rival output and boost market share, which accelerated a drop in prices.  I think the extent to which Saudi Arabia bled revenue during 2014-2016 forced them back to the OPEC table before the job of really turning the screw on U.S. shale and other non-OPEC supply was completed,  said David Fyfe, chief economist at trading firm Gunvor.   However, the production deal has at least staunched the cash hemorrhage for now,  he said. The Reuters calculation is based on data from the International Energy Agency and figures published by OPEC about its production according to estimates by six secondary sources. FILE PHOTO: A view shows al-Shuaiba oil refinery in southwest Basra, Iraq  April 20, 2017.Essam Al-Sudani/File PhotoFor the price, Reuters used the OPEC basket, an index of the crudes sold by the member countries. It is intended to illustrate the general trend for oil revenues and does not aim to give exact estimates of countries' oil export earnings.  Stick With It OPEC and non-OPEC allies led by Russia initially agreed to cut about 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) in the first half of 2017. But with the supply glut proving slow to shift, they agreed on May 25 to prolong the deal to the first quarter of 2018. Slideshow (2 Images)A drop in prices since then has prompted some OPEC delegates to question whether the deal is enough, but the group is in no rush to deepen its output cut. Rising U.S. production has undermined some of the impact of the OPEC-led cuts. In addition, Libya and Nigeria, two OPEC members exempted from the curbs, have increased output although not by enough to alter the overall picture of lower OPEC output in the six-month period. While OPEC states will welcome the extra revenue, it has not yet plugged budget deficits that have opened up. To balance its books, Saudi Arabia needs oil closer to $75 a barrel, asset management firm AB Bernstein estimates. However, Fyfe of Gunvor said the higher earnings during the first half of this year will probably give producers sufficient motivation to keep going and even consider further measures.  Taking Dubai oil as a benchmark, prices so far in 2017 are 25 percent above last year's $41 average, while OPEC production in the same time is 2 percent, or 700,000 bpd, below 2016's average, he said.  That arithmetic ought to persuade OPEC and Russia of the value of sticking with it, maybe cutting sufficient extra barrels to offset Libya and Nigeria increases and reaping the reward of higher overall 2017 revenues,  said Fyfe.  But the politics of apportioning further cuts will get messy,  he added. Khelil also said he thought OPEC needed to keep on with supply restraint beyond the expiry of the current deal to protect the increase in income earned this year.   It would be in the best interest of OPEC to plan on continuing curtailing production after the end of March 2018 so as to maintain the 9 to 10 percent gain in revenues achieved in 2017,  he said.

He also said the BOJ's current ultra-loose monetary policy is already bold enough, signalling that no additional stimulus was forthcoming in the near future.  The BOJ is buying ETFs to stimulate the economy and achieve its 2 percent inflation target,  Harada told a seminar.  If achievement of the target comes into sight, the BOJ could of course reduce or stop ETF purchases,  he said. But Harada said it was too early to say when the BOJ could reduce ETF purchases as inflation remains distant from the bank's target. Under a massive stimulus programme dubbed  quantitative and qualitative easing  (QQE), the BOJ has been aggressively buying assets such as government bonds, ETFs and trust funds investing in property. But inflation has failed to reach 2 percent, forcing the BOJ to add yield curve control to QQE last year and shift its policy target to interest rates from the pace of money printing. Harada, a vocal advocate of aggressive money printing, said the BOJ's stimulus programme was  already sufficiently bold .  By continuing this programme, we can expect inflation to gradually approach 2 percent,  he said. Harada also said it was premature to debate when the BOJ could withdraw stimulus. But he said the BOJ will seek to avoid any spike in bond yields through close dialogue with financial markets, when the time comes to tighten policy.  We don't know when it will happen but at some point, the BOJ will undoubtedly need to tighten monetary policy,  Harada said.

Recent hawkish talk from Western central banks has driven German short-term yields to the highest in a year and the euro to a one-year high - but emerging markets have been relatively sanguine thanks to a better growth and current account picture at home as well as a relatively subdued U.S. yield picture.  Markets have been able to swallow this in a better way than in the past,  said Danske Bank analyst Jakob Christensen, noting stronger global economic growth.  In the euro zone, there is quite a strong economic momentum that is helping risk sentiment in general and, with that, emerging markets.  A financials-led rally on Wall Street allowed emerging equities also to rebound. Hong Kong rose 1 percent, led by a 4 percent jump in HSBC  and a 2 percent gain on the financials index. Hong Kong's main bourse shrugged off fresh falls in its small-cap market, which hit a new record closing low. Emerging currencies also mostly firmed against the dollar, with China's yuan touching a seven-month high. The rouble also rose 0.3 percent, buoyed by oil prices firming for the sixth straight day. Euro-crosses in central Europe, however, were under pressure, with the Polish zloty and Hungarian forint both slipping 0.3 percent against the single currency and bond yields staying elevated. Polish 10-year yields touched new five-week highs , up almost 20 basis points this week, while Hungarian yields are at three-week highs.  There will be spillover from higher yields in the euro area to these economies. We do see that the very strong economic growth picture there is also prompting higher yields, given that inflation will be on the rise eventually,  Christensen said. But ING Bank analysts played down the risk to the region after an initial adjustment to higher Bund yields.  To the extent to which the rise in Bund yields is gradual, and the ECB avoids a U.S. 'taper-tantrum'-like bond sell-off, then short-term downside risk to central European currencies versus the euro via the bond sell-off channel should be limited and short-lived,  they told clients. The Czech crown was flat before a central bank rate decision that is expected to keep policy unchanged but could signal the timing of its first rate rise. Many Gulf markets remained shut for Eid but the Qatari riyal appeared to have stabilised around the official 3.64 per dollar peg after a large fall in thin liquidity earlier this week . The currency has also firmed in forward markets, back towards the peg level. However, Qatari debt insurance costs rose to a 16-month high of 120 basis points, according to IHS Markit data.

Euro zone governments sketched new detail on possible debt relief for the crisis-hit country on June 15 and approved the release of 8.5 billion euros in bailout loans wrapping up a progress review which dragged on more than six months. But the ECB has said conditions are not right yet for Greece to be included in its bond-buying quantitative easing programme.  The Greek government now has a short to medium-term objective which is of course access to the markets, which is... a possibility with or without QE,  said told an Economist conference in Athens. Tsakalotos said that Greece would  soon indicate  to investors the strategy for its bond market return -- the first since 2014 -- but the aim, he said, was not to make just a one-off attempt.  We don't want to go too early but ... when we do go, we want to ensure that markets know that this is part of a strategy,  he said. The June 15 agreement was a relief for the Greek government which is sagging in opinion polls and wants to convince Greeks that, after seven years of belt-tightening, their sacrifices are paying off and the country can emerge from crisis. It initially aimed for a debt relief deal which would allow its bonds to be included in the ECB's asset-buying programme and therefore help speed up its market return efforts. Tsakalotos said quantitative easing would help Greek banks, but that it was largely symbolic.  I wouldn't elevate it too high and I don't think that investment funds and equity funds elevate it that high,  he said.  It is very useful, it is important, but mostly it is symbolic.  Tsakalotos said he was  entirely confident  that Greece would post  good growth  in 2017 and 2018, but the country's aim was to make sure that this growth is sustainable. Speaking at the same conference, European Stability Mechanism Chief Klaus Regling urged Greece to stick to reforms and said he was confident it would return to bond markets before it's programme ends in 2018.

Coking coal futures in China soared almost 8 percent on Thursday. [IRONORE/] The newspaper did not cite the source of its information nor a reason for the ban. But China, the world's top coal buyer, has been keeping a tight lid on supply of the fuel in the country as part of efforts to tackle both glut and smog.  The ban will cover more than 150 second-tier ports, according to the report which was scarce on details. But it doesn't include the major ports such as Tianjin.  Many second-tier ports are owned by power plants on the coast and the ban may increase their shipping and loading fees, said a trader from the port city of Rizhao. Loading fees at first-tier ports are $1 higher per tonne than those at second-tier ones, the trader said.  A source at the trading arm of Indian coal firm Adani Group said none of their cargoes has been affected so far. Adani sells Indonesian and Australian coal to China.  Small ports linked to major Chinese power utilities have stopped ships carrying coal from either loading or docking at the ports starting this week, according to a trader in Ningbo, a major port in China's eastern Zhejiang province. Customs also conducted random checks of coal cargoes and did a more thorough inspection process before clearing shipments, the trader said.      It is extremely hard to do import business now,  she said.  Coal imports are set to slow down if this continues for a long time.  China's campaign to address oversupply in coal has led to the closure of many mines across the country, tightening availability of the fuel during summer when power demand usually peaks. Beijing has also cracked down on coal imports to restrict the flow of low-quality material. China's coal imports dropped 10.5 percent in May from April. Chinese thermal coal futures hit a record high of 585 yuan ($86) a tonne last week, climbing nearly 10 percent so far this month.  China's top planning body has urged coal mines to speed up the release of high-grade coal capacity to help ensure electricity supply during peak hours and to key regions in summer, the state-backed Security Daily reported earlier on Wednesday.

Prime Minister Theresa May promised to hold the inquiry into the fire a day after it broke out in Grenfell Tower in the early hours of June 14, gutting the 24-storey block and trapping residents in their beds as they slept. A spokesman for May's office said retired court of appeals judge Martin Moore-Bick would be appointed later on Thursday to head the inquiry. Moore-Bick spent more than 20 years as a judge and retired in December last year from his role as Lord Justice of Appeal. The Times newspaper said members of May's senior team had expressed initial misgivings about Moore-Bick after he ruled in favour of a London council in a dispute with a single mother of five children who had refused to be rehoused away from her home into a city north of London. The ruling was overturned by the Supreme Court. Families who survived the blaze at the Grenfell social housing block have expressed concerns that they will be rehoused away from the Kensington area in London. Police have said that at least 80 people were dead, or missing and presumed dead, from the fire. The final death toll will be known only after officers complete a painstaking search and recovery operation which could take until the end of the year.

The government has started to reduce the large stock of expenditure arrears but further efforts are needed to improve budgetary controls and better withstand fiscal pressures if the national debt is to remain at sustainable levels,  the bank said in a report. Zambia's external debt stood at $7.2 billion at the end of May, up from $6.86 billion at the end of last year.  The cost of servicing debt now amounts to 20 percent of domestic revenue in 2017 from 8 percent in 2012. This leaves less resources for development priorities and poverty reduction,  the bank said. Zambia had continued to have revenue shortfalls in the first half of 2017 and expenditure plans had not been moderated, it said, adding all sectors of the economy were expected to contribute to the forecasted growth of 4.1 percent in 2017.

Vivendi has gradually raised its stake in Ubisoft, best known for its Assassin's Creed and South Park video games, but so far Ubisoft's co-founder and CEO Yves Guillemot and his family have managed to fend off the media giant. Vivendi currently holds 27 percent of Ubisoft's share capital and 24.5 percent of the voting rights.      If such a premium were necessary to take control of the company, Vivendi would have to pay out 5.4 billion euros ($6 billion) for the remaining shares in Ubisoft, a hefty price for Vivendi whose net cash position slumped to 473 million euros at the end of March from 6.4 billion euros at the end of 2015. But Vivendi, led by billionaire Vincent Bollore, wants to grow in the advertising and video games sectors and will soon take control of ad group Havas (HAVA.PA), potentially leaving Ubisoft next in line.  It has gradually raised its stake in the business since 2015 and is asking for board representation. It has said it sees synergies between the two groups.  The Guillemot family owns 13.6 percent of Ubisoft and 20 percent of its voting rights.  It's all a question of price,  said Richard-Maxime Beaudoux, an analyst at Bryan, Garnier & Co who estimates any full bid from Vivendi would be in the range of 60-67 euros per share, compared with a 50.56 euro share price on Wednesday.  The Guillemot's have so far received the support of Ubisoft third-biggest investor, mutual fund giant Fidelity Investments, two sources close to the matter told Reuters. Fidelity's 10 percent stake would help the Guillemot's block any attempt by Vivendi to elect a board member at the next general meeting in September, the sources added. Fidelity and Vivendi declined to comment.   Ubisoft's largest institutional shareholders are firmly sided with the current management team for now,  said Timothy O'Shea, an analyst at Jefferies who estimated the necessary premium on the video games maker to be at least 30 percent.  Investors are also concerned about brain drain; if Vivendi gains control we could see creative talent or executive departures,  he added. Other top institutional investors include BlackRock and Norges Bank. A generous cash offer could even convince Ubisoft's CEO to stay, Beaudoux said.   If there's a significant premium and Guillemot can stay, then (video game) developers would also stay,  he said.

The transactions are securitisations of Australian conforming residential mortgages originated by Police & Nurses Limited, trading as P&N; Bank. A full list of rating actions follows at the end of this commentary. KEY RATING DRIVERS The affirmations reflect Fitch's view that available credit enhancement supports the notes' current ratings, the agency's expectations of Australia's economic conditions, and that the credit quality and performance of the loans in the collateral pools remain within the agency's expectations. All transactions, except Pinnacle Series Trust 2014-SST, had arrears above Fitch's 4Q16 Dinkum RMBS Index at end-April 2017, although there has only been one loss from Pinnacle Series Trust 2010-T1. The Pinnacle Series Trust 2013-T1 and Pinnacle 2014-SST transactions have not experienced any losses since closing. All three pools are highly concentrated in Western Australia, with more than 90% of mortgages in the portfolio secured over properties in the state. The default model was not re-run for Pinnacle 2010-T1 and Pinnacle 2013-T1, as the outstanding ratings are only 'AAAsf'; the transactions do not have a revolving period; and a review of pre-determined performance triggers indicates the transactions display stable asset performance. Pinnacle 2014-SST has a 10-year revolving period, of which less than seven years remain.  Fitch believes the risks associated with the long revolving period are commensurate with the ratings because the transaction has portfolio parameters, the portfolio stratifications have not changed significantly since initial issue and the portfolio is performing as expected. RATING SENSITIVITIES The ratings are not expected to be affected by any foreseeable change in performance. The transactions are currently amortising pro rata. They will then move back to sequential amortisation at call, mitigating tail risk. The notes' ratings are independent of lenders' mortgage insurance (LMI) and are therefore not sensitive to downgrades of the LMI providers' ratings. USE OF THIRD PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10 Form ABS Due Diligence-15E was not provided to, or reviewed by, Fitch in relation to this rating action. DATA ADEQUACY Fitch has checked the consistency and plausibility of the information it has received about the performance of the asset pools and the transactions. There were no findings that were material to this analysis. Fitch has not reviewed the results of any third-party assessment of the asset portfolio as part of its ongoing monitoring. As part of its ongoing monitoring, Fitch reviewed a small targeted sample of P&N; Bank's origination files and found the information contained in the reviewed files to be adequately consistent with the originator's policies and practices and the other information provided to the agency about the asset portfolio. Overall, Fitch's assessment of the asset pool information relied upon for the agency's rating analysis according to its applicable rating methodologies indicates that it is adequately reliable. SOURCES OF INFORMATION The information below was used in the analysis: Loan-by-loan data for Pinnacle 2014-SST provided by P&N; Bank as at end-May 17 Transaction reporting data provided by P&N; Bank as at end-April 2017 Loan enforcement details provided by P&N; Bank as at end-April 2017 The issuer has informed Fitch that not all relevant underlying information used in the analysis of the rated notes is public.

The manner of Fitch’s factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors.

Three days of the biggest gains in more than a year for the single currency have pushed the broader dollar index to its lowest since October and prompted some of the market's biggest dollar supporters to call the currency's rally over. Draghi's speech on Tuesday - coming amid a raft of hawkish signals from other major global central banks - convinced markets the ECB was preparing to start withdrawing its own emergency stimulus for the euro zone economy later this year. After a long run lower, that has put the euro back in relatively uncharted territory, with some analysts arguing there is little technical resistance beneath $1.20.  The biggest test will be 1.1500,  said RBC's head of global FX strategy Elsa Lignos.  Though month-end USD selling may reinforce the bearish USD sentiment in the next few days, we still think EUR’s rally is more likely to run out of steam at 1.15.  By 0730 GMT, the euro was trading 0.4 percent stronger at $1.1425, having broken briefly above last year's June high of $1.1428. It was also 0.4 percent higher against the yen at 128.275 yen. The other big gainers among the G10 group of major developed world currencies over the past 24 hours were the Canadian dollar and sterling, both also driven by comments by their respective central bank governors. Sterling gained another half a percent in morning trade in London, stopping just shy of its first break above $1.30 in five weeks.  This is simply the central banks getting together and trying to arrest inflation,  said Nomura's head of G10 currency trading Peter Gorra.  They are trying to be as smart as they can and agreeing that they have to act in unison. I don't think this is necessarily a dollar move and I don't think the dollar's rally is over. They are just trying to add some two-way risk to the market.

It's all a question of price,  said Richard-Maxime Beaudoux, an analyst at Bryan, Garnier & Co who estimates any full bid from Vivendi would be in the range of 60-67 euros per share, compared with a 50.56 euro share price on Wednesday.  The Guillemot's have so far received the support of Ubisoft third-biggest investor, mutual fund giant Fidelity Investments, two sources close to the matter told Reuters. Fidelity's 10 percent stake would help the Guillemot's block any attempt by Vivendi to elect a board member at the next general meeting in September, the sources added. Fidelity and Vivendi declined to comment.   Ubisoft's largest institutional shareholders are firmly sided with the current management team for now,  said Timothy O'Shea, an analyst at Jefferies who estimated the necessary premium on the video games maker to be at least 30 percent.  Investors are also concerned about brain drain; if Vivendi gains control we could see creative talent or executive departures,  he added. Other top institutional investors include BlackRock and Norges Bank. A generous cash offer could even convince Ubisoft's CEO to stay, Beaudoux said.   If there's a significant premium and Guillemot can stay, then (video game) developers would also stay,  he said.

Forward Eonia bank-to-bank rates dated for the ECB meeting in July 2018 stood on Thursday at around minus 0.2713 percent, about 9 basis points above the Eonia spot rate of minus 0.3620 percent. This gap suggests markets are pricing in a roughly 90 percent chance of a rate hike by the end of July 2018. Market expectations for a tightening in monetary policy have shot up this week after comments from European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi, remaining elevated even after the ECB tried to soothe the market reaction on Wednesday.

The ruling Social Democrats plan to replace a flat 16 percent corporate tax on profit with a multi-levelled tax on turnover and introduce  a solidarity contribution  next year, a revised governing programme showed.     Designated Prime Minister Mihai Tudose was picked as prime minister after ruling parties sacked premier Sorin Grindeanu on June 21 for failing to implement an ambitious programme that helped them win a December election.      A majority of ministers from the ousted cabinet feature in the new government lineup. It is likely to receive approval given the comfortable parliamentary majority held by the ruling Social Democrat Party (PSD) and its junior partner ALDE.     The confidence vote is expected later on Thursday. The overall impact from the new governing programme remains to be seen but initial market reactions show negative expectations for equities.     The leu was flat after a session of above-market gains on Wednesday, and other currencies were also broadly unchanged. Politics is expected to impact the Romanian unit in the longer term, an analyst said.      Even if this brings an end to the government crisis for now, politics remain a factor of uncertainty in Romania,  Commerzbank said in a note.      The case of the previous government illustrated just how quickly Dragnea can withdraw his support.       Focus is now likely to increasingly rest on the positive fundamental environment, and we see appreciation potential for RON,  it added.     The Czech central bank is widely expected to maintain its key interest rate unchanged near zero on Thursday but its first rate hike in about a decade is getting closer and could come before the year's end rather than next year as previously expected, a Reuters poll showed on Monday.      While the bank's own outlook indicates a hike may come in the third quarter, several board members, including Governor Jiri Rusnok, have said the tightening might come after that if the crown currency appreciates significantly.      Still, markets are not yet pricing in a hike this year.      So the CNB is much more hawkish than the market,  a rates dealer said.

May's botched gamble on a June 8 snap election lost her Conservative Party its majority in parliament, leading her to strike a deal on Monday with a small Northern Irish party to ensure she has enough votes to pass legislation in parliament. May has a working majority of 13 in the 650-seat parliament with the support of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), and won a vote on Wednesday by 323 votes to 309. But the opposition Labour Party led by Jeremy Corbyn has proposed amendments which could test the discipline of May's supporters. The debate on May's legislative agenda, known as the Queen's Speech, begins around 1000 GMT and will go on for the rest of the day. The focus of the debate is the economy and jobs. Opponents have put forward amendments calling for environmental protection measures ahead of Britain's exit from the European union and the abandonment of a so-called  hard Brexit  to ensure continued membership of the single market. Other demands include ending public spending cuts and the provision of free abortions in the national health service for Northern Irish women travelling to England.

Australia's Pell, the Vatican's treasurer, is the most senior figure in the Catholic Church to face charges of committing sexual offences. He strenuously denies the charges. Pell was charged by summons to appear before a Melbourne court on July 18. Here are some key facts about him: - Pell was born on June 8, 1941, in the country town of Ballarat in the state of Victoria in Australia's south. - Pell was ordained as a priest in 1966 and served in his home state from 1971 to 1983, including 10 years in Ballarat. - In 1996 he became the Archbishop of Melbourne, a role in which he helped establish the  Melbourne Response , the Catholic Church's first formal system of handling abuse complaints in Australia. -  He was appointed Archbishop of Sydney, Australia's most senior Catholic role, in 2001. - The following year, Pell stepped aside to face a closed hearing over abuse allegations dating back to the 1960s. The Church committee hearing the allegations found insufficient evidence to justify further action and Pell resumed his role. - In 2003, Pell was made a cardinal. - With the death of Pope John II in 2005, Australian media identify Pell as a contender to succeed him. - Pell's work at the Vatican increased by 2012 and he was asked by Pope Benedict XVI to join a high-ranking papal assembly. In 2013, Pope Francis appointed him to an eight-member group to advise on reforming the Church. - In 2014 he was appointed Prefect of the Secretariat for the Economy, the Vatican's first financial controller. - Pell appeared at an Australian government inquiry into institutional child abuse in 20016, testifying via videolink from Rome because he was too sick to fly home. He said the Church made  catastrophic  choices by minimizing its response to, and covering up, abuse complaints. - Australian police traveled to Rome later that year to interview Pell about the abuse complaints.

Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has opted to court China for its business and investment and avoid the rows over maritime sovereignty that dogged his predecessors. Duterte has faced criticism at home for being what some people see as too soft on China over the long-running territorial dispute, but he considers his approach to be pragmatic and says challenging China risks triggering war. Wang, speaking to reporters after meeting with Philippine Foreign Minister Alan Peter Cayetano in Beijing, said the two countries have signed 22 cooperative agreements in less than six months and China has become the Philippines' biggest trading partner for the first time.  Our two countries have set up a bilateral consultation mechanism on the South China Sea issue and also a mechanism for cooperation between the coast guards,  Wang said.  If anyone wants to reverse the current progress it will harm the interests of the Philippine people and that is not what we would like to see,  he said. Cayetano said peace and stability in the East and South China Seas, as well as the whole region, was a tangible outcome of the recent improvement of relations with China. He also praised Chinese President Xi Jinping's Belt and Road initiative to link countries through infrastructure development as  a big idea in a world that is searching and wanting for big ideas . China claims most of the energy-rich South China Sea, through which about $5 trillion in ship-borne trade passes every year. Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam also have claims in the waters, where China has been building up military facilities like runways on the islands it controls. The previous Philippine government filed a case in 2013 with the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague on maritime boundaries. Last year the tribunal invalidated China's claim to sovereignty over most of the South China Sea, but Duterte has put the ruling on the back burner and said he will revisit it later in his term. The United States has criticised China's construction in the disputed waters, concerned the facilities could be used to restrict free movement and extend China's strategic reach. Under President Donald Trump, the United States has continued  freedom of navigation  exercises intended to show China that it is not entitled to territorial waters there. Beijing says such actions by the United States heighten tensions and risk disrupting negotiations between stakeholders.

Majid Al Futtaim, a holding company which also owns and operates shopping centres in the Middle East and North Africa, said in a statement it had acquired Geant franchise owner Retail Arabia from BMA International. The value of the deal, which also includes four Gulfmart supermarkets in Bahrain, was not disclosed. All 30 stores will be rebranded under the Carrefour brand by the end of 2017 and existing employees will be retained. The deal covered the stores only and did not include Geant franchising rights.

The acquisition increases the number of Majid Al Futtaim Carrefour-operated outlets to 80 in the UAE, 11 in Bahrain and 8 in Kuwait. Perella Weinberg Partners advised Majid Al Futtaim on the transaction. Bejjani said further acquisitions were being considered in retail, technology and digital, and leisure entertainment in markets where Majid Al Futtaim already has a presence. He did not provide details. Bejjani also said Majid Al Futtaim was monitoring the situation in Qatar where it operates Carrefour outlets after four Arab countries this month cut off diplomatic, economic and transport ties with the country. Majid Al Futtaim is not rethinking its growth plans for Qatar and there has been no negative financial impact for the company from the cutting of ties, he said.  There is not a lot of visibility on how things are going to evolve so for the time being we are just going to monitor the situation and deal with the realities as they unfold.

Tesco and the wholesaler Booker announced the cash and shares deal in January and the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) formally started its initial Phase 1 review on May 30.  The CMA is assessing whether the deal could reduce competition and choice for shoppers and other customers, such as stores currently supplied by Booker. The initial investigation  was due to run until July 25.  We have now requested that the CMA uses the fast track process to allow it to move more quickly to examining the merger through a detailed Phase 2 process,  the companies said. They said they expect the CMA to issue a decision to refer to Phase 2 within the next two weeks. The transaction will be cleared if that inquiry, which lasts up to 24 weeks, does not find it will reduce competition. If competition is seen to be affected, the CMA can either seek remedies or block the deal.

Sentiment was also boosted by easing fears of a quarter-end liquidity crunch in the banking system, as well as a rise in the yuan, which assuaged concerns about capital outflows. The blue-chip CSI300 index rose 0.6 percent, to 3,668.83 points, while the Shanghai Composite Index gained 0.5 percent to 3,188.06 points. The raw material sector firmed 0.9 percent as global commodity prices rose on the back of a weaker U.S. dollar.  The weaker dollar benefited China's commodity-related stocks in an indirect way,  said Chen Yong, analyst at Lianxun Securities.  Besides, a strengthening yuan eases capital outflow fears.  Reflecting the dollar's broad weakness, China's yuan rose against the dollar on Thursday to its highest level in 7-1/2-months. Receding fears of capital outflows from China added to relief that China's banking system does not appear to be suffering from a cash shortage at the end of the second quarter, as some had feared. Citing  relatively high  liquidity, China's central bank skipped open market operations for the fifth day in a row on Thursday. Shares in China's coal miners were particularly strong, as the country said it will ban coal imports at small ports from July 1, boosting China's coking coal futures. Shanxi Coking surged the maximum allowed 10 percent, while Shanxi Xishan Coal jumped 4.4 percent.

Novartis said last week that canakinumab had been found to reduce further heart attacks or strokes in a large study, confounding expectations among analysts who had not expected it to work, given past setbacks with anti-inflammatory approaches. Doctors and analysts, however, still need to see the scale of the benefit and the nature of any side effects to assess its potential. The Swiss drugmaker said earlier it had been hoping to present at the ESC but that it might have to wait until a later meeting. The ESC meeting will also feature results on Aug. 29 from a study involving Merck's heart drug anacetrapib, as previously announced by the U.S. company.

We have no reason to hoard liquidity if no significant external investment opportunity arises. We intend to return excess cash to our shareholders after 24 months without significant M&A; activity,  Chief Executive Patrick Thomas said in a statement on Thursday, citing share buybacks or special dividends as options. The maker of chemicals for blu-ray discs and insulation foams is banking on better usage rates at its large chemical sites, which parent Bayer has kept in shape over recent years and which do not require considerable upgrades. Rivals in the market for chemicals used in insulation and upholstery foams have suffered a number of technical setbacks, leading to muted supply growth and a surge in prices over previous quarters. The company's cash flow after expenditures on plants and equipment, or free cash flow, tripled to close to a billion euros last year and Covestro on Thursday raised the prospect of sustaining that rate over the next five years, even though it will invest to overcome some production bottlenecks. Market leading positions in its established businesses -- transparent polycarbonate plastics used for headlights and sunroofs in cars as well as polyurethane foams for vehicle seats and insulation -- keep Covestro from large acquisition in those markets due to antitrust concerns. But it would seek to bolster its smaller but high-margin coating ingredients business.  We look at bolt-on acquisitions to boost our specialty businesses,  said Thomas, who temporarily took on the role of finance chief after the departure of CFO Frank Lutz, who lost out to a fellow board member in the contest to take the CEO position next year.

Comments from ECB chief Mario Draghi on Tuesday were seen as opening the door to monetary policy tweaks, fuelling market expectations that the central bank could announce a reduction in stimulus in September. ECB sources told Reuters on Wednesday that markets had over interpreted Draghi's comments, allowing bond yields to pare some of their sharp increases. However, in a week during which Bank of England Governor Mark Carney has also raised the spectre of an interest rate hike in Britain in the coming months, nervous investors stayed away from rate-sensitive bond markets.  Seeing the fall-out of Tuesday's speech from Draghi, ECB officials showed some effort to downplay the message,  analysts at ING said in a note.  The 10-year Bund yield, consequently, dropped back somewhat, but the 'damage' has been done and yields have settled in the upper half of the year-to-date trading range.  Germany's benchmark 10-year bond yield jumped 5 basis points to 0.42 percent, its highest level in five weeks. It has risen roughly 19 bps from seven-week lows hit two weeks ago. Other yields across the single-currency bloc were 5-6 bps higher on the day. U.S. Treasury yields, which have been dragged higher by large moves in their European peers this week, also nudged up in early London trade. In the euro zone, focus turned to inflation numbers from Germany - the bloc's biggest economy - later on Thursday for the latest clues on the monetary policy outlook. A shortage of eligible bonds for the ECB's purchase programme has also fuelled speculation that the central bank may have to start unwinding its asset-purchase scheme sooner rather than later. This week's Draghi comments only highlight that the tapering discussion at the ECB will become more pertinent in coming months, analysts said.  We are approaching the point where the ECB is going to have to discuss tapering as it's running out of eligible bonds to buy for the scheme,  said Commerzbank rates strategist Rainer Guntermann.  And Draghi has painted a scenario where there is a also fundamental reason for that if the ECB looks past recent subdued inflation data.

The Los Angeles Dodgers' catcher hit a game-tying home run with two outs in the top of the ninth, only to commit a passed ball and throwing error on the same play in the bottom of the inning, handing the Los Angeles Angels a 3-2 win Wednesday night at Angel Stadium.  I'm sorry, low?  Grandal said when asked about going from such a high to such a low in the span of one inning.  Are we in first place? There's no lows here.  The Angels' winning rally started when Dodgers shortstop Chris Taylor, subbing for the injured Corey Seager, booted Ben Revere's ground ball for an error with one out. With Cameron Maybin hitting, Revere took second on a wild pitch by Pedro Baez (2-1). The reliever then struck out Maybin, but the ball got through the legs of Grandal for a passed ball, allowing Revere to take third and Maybin to break for first. Grandal said the pitch from Baez crossed him up. Related CoveragePreview: Dodgers at AngelsLos Angeles Dodgers - PlayerWatchLos Angeles Angels - PlayerWatch You thought you're getting 97 (mph) with sink and you get 89; it happens,  Grandal said.  It actually ended up being a really good pitch.  Then Grandal, trying to get Maybin at first, threw the ball over the head of first baseman Chase Utley, allowing Revere to come home with the winning run. Maybin didn't run initially when the ball got away from Grandal.  I picked up the ball, kinda saw that Maybin wasn't running,  Grandal said.  I didn't get a good grip on it; and, as soon as I double-clutched, I said, 'Oh (expletive), Revere's at third, he could go home.' I tried to hurry up, didn't have a grip on it, and all of a sudden I'm off balance and threw it away.  With 40 years in professional baseball as a player, coach and manager, Angels manager Mike Scioscia said Wednesday's ending was a first for him.  I don't know if I've ever seen a game end that way,  he said.  (Maybin) didn't really know where the ball was and didn't run right away. Ben saw at second and made the turn, then it looked like Grandal rushed it a little bit and left it up and away. We'll take it.  The Angels were one strike away from winning the game without all the drama in the top of the ninth. Cam Bedrosian (2-0) took the ball and a 2-1 lead into the inning and needed just four pitches to get two outs. However, on a 3-2 count and with the crowd on its feet anticipating the final out, Bedrosian hung a breaking pitch to Grandal, who launched it over the fence in center field for a tying home run.  A home run doesn't matter when you lose the game,  Grandal said.  The home run was no big deal.  Angels shortstop Andrelton Simmons' two-out, two-run home run in the sixth inning snapped a scoreless tie, spelling the beginning of the end for Dodgers starter Hyun-Jin Ryu. Ryu gave up two more hits in the inning before being removed by manager Dave Roberts. It also ended a pitchers' duel between Ryu and Angels starter Alex Meyer, who threw six scoreless innings and allowed only one hit. However, Meyer walked five and threw 99 pitches in the process.  Alex was on the edge early,  Scioscia said.  He struggled. That was an extreme effort for him to get through six innings. He made some big pitches to get out of a couple innings early, but he found his release point and finished strong through the sixth and gave us a chance to win. It's all you can ask for.  Ryu allowed two runs on seven hits and one walk in 5 2/3 innings. He struck out eight. Yusmeiro Petit threw a scoreless seventh inning for the Angels before Scioscia handed the ball to Keynan Middleton for the eighth. Middleton irked some Dodgers on Monday at Dodger Stadium when he screamed with delight after striking out Cody Bellinger to end the eighth inning. So, the Dodgers' dugout seemed even more excited than usual when Trayce Thompson homered off Middleton leading off the eighth on Wednesday, cutting the Angels' lead to 2-1. Middleton, though, held the lead by retiring the next three batters, getting the third out on Justin Turner's fly ball to the warning track in right-center. NOTES: Angels CF Mike Trout hit soft toss and could take batting practice against live pitching in the next day or two. Trout tore a ligament in his left thumb with a head-first slide into second base on May 28, and he had surgery on May 31. Angels manager Mike Scioscia said Trout could return in the next week or so. ... Dodgers SS Corey Seager ran and took batting practice to test his sore right hamstring. Seager hurt his hamstring last Friday, but the Dodgers decided against putting him on the disabled list, believing he could return within 10 days. If there are no setbacks, Seager could return to the lineup in the next couple of days. ... Dodgers 1B Cody Bellinger got the start at designated hitter. Bellinger has played in every game since being called up from Triple-A Oklahoma City on April 25. Wednesday was his first start at DH, and he went 0-for-4 with three strikeouts.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-dodgers-angels-writethru-idUSMTZED6TAQKX1E"},

The central bank will disclose the details of its buying intentions in each zone for next month on Friday. The BOJ kept its ranges intact in June, after trimming the amount of shorter-dated JGBs it bought compared with previous months in May and April. The 10-year cash JGB yield was untraded, while the September 10-year JGB futures contract finished down 0.08 point at 150.44. Superlong yields were flat, while the yield on the two-year JGB edged up half a basis point to minus 0.120 percent. The Ministry of Finance floated a plan on Wednesday to increase the size of short-term Japanese government bond issue through so-called liquidity-enhancing auctions to ease their shortage, a senior ministry official said. The plan was proposed to a gathering of JGB primary dealers, the official said, adding the ministry will make a final decision on the plan after sounding out investors' opinions. Economic data released earlier on Thursday showed Japanese retail sales rose less than expected last month, falling substantially from April's annual increase though analysts expect sales to continue rising as a trend.

Adam Wainwright started and dominated at times, and Trevor Rosenthal closed it out with his 100 mph fastball. Only with a lot more drama than a few years ago. Jedd Gyorko drove in two runs, Wainwright limited Arizona to two runs over 6 1/3 innings, and the Cardinals made good use of all six hits for a 4-3 victory Wednesday night, only the third Diamondbacks loss in 16 games. Arizona starter Zack Godley (3-2) gave up only two hits in seven innings but took the loss. He was hurt by his own wildness in the middle innings as he walked three, hit two batters and threw a wild pitch. He was charged with three runs, and he struck out seven. The Diamondbacks -- the majors' hottest team since mid-May, with 29 wins in 40 games -- struggled to get key hits against Wainwright and relievers Tyler Lyons, Brett Cecil and Rosenthal, who finished up in the ninth rather than usual closer Seung Hwan Oh. They also struggled all night with plate umpire D.J. Reyburn's wild strike zone, and it led to the fifth-inning ejections of catcher Jeff Mathis and manager Torey Lovullo.  I didn't think I said anything to be run from the ballgame, but obviously (Reyburn) did,  Mathis said.  It was a culmination of a few things. He knows why, and it extends beyond the strike zone -- and I'll leave it at that.  Related CoveragePreview: Cardinals at DiamondbacksSt. Louis Cardinals - PlayerWatchArizona Diamondbacks - PlayerWatchRosenthal's save was his fourth in six opportunities, but it didn't come easily. He walked two and threw two wild pitches -- one for a run -- before getting David Peralta to ground out with two runners on. He was slipping and sliding on a mound that Wainwright asked to be repaired earlier in the game, but St. Louis manager Mike Matheny couldn't get him to ask for any repairs.  Rosey didn't agree (that a substance should be added to the mound). ... He was pretty adamant, but I can't make him change the mound. But he got through it,  Matheny said.  The ball was sailing and slipping. ... But we needed someone to come on and do the job, close the door, and he's done it a lot. We know he has the stuff to do it. He trusted himself and stayed through it.  Even with a couple of slips along the way.  Obviously, we never give up,  Mathis said of the Diamondbacks' late comeback attempt.  We had a chance there at the end, just couldn't quite get it down. But they ground it out, for sure.  St. Louis, which gave up four runs over the final three innings to lose to Arizona 6-5 in 10 innings on Tuesday night, added an insurance run in the eighth Wednesday against reliever Braden Shipley. Matt Carpenter doubled to right and, after a pair of strikeouts, Gyorko doubled to center. Wainwright (8-5) gave up eight hits and walked one but struck out eight while repeatedly getting key outs when he needed them. He struck out Paul Goldschmidt to leave the bases loaded in the third, limited Arizona to a run despite giving up two doubles to start the fourth, and got Brandon Drury to line out following Chris Owings' two-out double in the sixth.  That's probably the best fastball he's had all season,  Matheny said. The Cardinals had lost four of their previous six and 16 of their previous 25. Arizona lost for only the second time in its past 13 at Chase Field.  It's fun winning,  Cecil said. The Cardinals didn't get a hit off Godley for the first three innings, then needed only two singles to take a 3-0 lead in the fourth with the help of some wildness.  He was really superb. ... It was just the one inning he ran into some problems,  Lovullo said. The right-hander walked Carpenter and hit Stephen Piscotty with a pitch around Tommy Pham's single, and Gyorko also walked to force in a run. Yadier Molina then laced a two-run single to left field, making it 3-0 and extending his hitting streak to 14 games.  Guys grind through at-bats, and Yadi gets a real big hit right there, and that's what it takes, that timely hitting,  Matheny said. Arizona got a run back against Wainwright in the bottom of the fourth on successive doubles by Jake Lamb and Owings but missed a chance to pick up additional scoring when the right-hander struck out Drury, Rey Fuentes and Mathis in succession. Drury and Mathis both went down on contested third strikes. Drury managed to stay in the game despite taking a slow walk back to the dugout, but Reyburn ejected Mathis for arguing too much. Lovullo also was quickly tossed when he raced out of the dugout out to protest. The ejections were the Diamondbacks' first this season.  We played catchup all night and unfortunately came up short at the end,  Lovullo said. NOTES: Cardinals SS Paul DeJong was brushed by a fan who ran onto the field and nearly reached the infield before five security guards corralled him. ... Diana Taurasi, who recently became the WNBA's all-time leading scorer, threw a high, hard fastball during the ceremonial first pitch. It was a much more impressive throw than that last week by Suns first-round pick Josh Jackson, whose soft toss landed about 15 feet wide of home plate. ... The Cardinals made a somewhat surprising move, demoting 2016 NL All-Star INF Aledmys Diaz to Triple-A Memphis and bringing up INF Alex Mejia, who recently was promoted from Double-A Springfield to Triple-A Memphis. Diaz was batting .261 and had a team-high 71 hits. ... Diamondbacks INF Nick Ahmed will be out six to eight weeks with a fractured right hand that required surgery Wednesday to insert three pins. He was replaced by INF Ketel Marte, who led all minor-leaguers with 105 hits for Reno of the Pacific Coast League.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-cardinals-diamondbacks-writethru-idUSMTZED6TAMV605"},

The San Diego Padres set a season high for runs without the benefit of a homer, beating the Atlanta Braves 7-4. Five of the Padres' runs came on two-out hits, including four on a pair of two-out, opposite-field, extra-base hits by Cory Spangenberg and Hunter Renfroe off suddenly aging veteran Bartolo Colon.  I thought we had some quality two-out at-bats tonight,  manager Andy Green said after his Padres snapped a five-game, head-to-head losing streak to the Braves.  We haven't had a ton of those this season.  The left-handed-hitting Spangenberg lined a two-run double into the left-field corner in the first to put the Padres ahead.

Four relievers retired the last 11 Braves, with Brandon Maurer picking up his 15th save. Colon's return to Petco Park, where he hit his only career homer last season, was less than triumphant. The 44-year-old right-hander gave up six runs on eight hits and three walks in four innings. Colon (2-8) saw his ERA rise to 8.14.  I feel good, and that's the most important thing to me,  Colon said.  I just feel like I've hit a rough streak, to be honest, and it's tough to just snap out of it. But all you can do is work and try to see if you can get out of it any way you can.  The reality is that I've been getting hit hard, and that's the truth and you can't dance around it.  Colon's position in the rotation is perilous.  That's all for them to decide,  he said.  I have zero to say with that. It's not my decision to make. Whatever decision they make, I'm going to follow.  Braves manager Brian Snitker said of Colon's future:  I don't know, to be honest with you. I'm going to process it tonight and then kind of see what's going on. The bullpen is always an option. Like I said, I'll just kind of wait and see what happens in a couple of days.  Colon's command failed him in the two-run first. He struck out two of the first four Padres, but he walked the other two, setting up a two-out, two-run double by Spangenberg that scored Margot and Renfroe. Margot, who came off the disabled list Tuesday after missing a month with a calf injury, singled to open the third, stole second and third and scored on a Wil Myers single. Colon retired the next two hitters before giving up back-to-back singles by Aybar and Asuaje to bring Myers home. The Padres added two more in the fourth on a two-out rally. Margot singled, Myers walked and both scored on Renfroe's opposite-field triple into the right-field corner. It was the first triple of Renfroe's career. The Braves stormed back in the sixth against Perdomo and reliever Phil Maton, putting six straight runners on with one out and scoring four runs. Ender Inciarte and Brandon Phillips singled with one out, and Nick Markakis walked to load the bases. Former Padre Matt Kemp followed with a two-run single to center ahead of a Matt Adams single that reloaded the bases. Maton entered the game and hit Tyler Flowers with a pitch to force in a run, then gave up a RBI groundout to Lane Adams, who just beat a double-play relay from shortstop Aybar to keep the inning alive. Maton struck out Johan Camargo to end the inning. All four runs were charged to Perdomo, who gave up seven hits and two walks and struck out four in 5 1/3 innings. The Padres added a seventh run in the seventh after loading the bases with one out. Rule 5 rookie Allen Cordoba hit a high chop to short and beat the relay on the potential inning-ending double play to score Aybar, who had opened the inning with his third hit. NOTES: Atlanta INF Freddie Freeman took batting practice Wednesday for the first time since having wrist surgery. Freeman, who has been on the disabled list since May 18, could start a rehab assignment this weekend. ... Braves C Tyler Flowers left the game after being hit by a pitch on the left forearm in the sixth. ... Manager Andy Green said the Padres rewrote their ground rules for the right-field wall at Petco Park on Wednesday after an  ambiguity  in the ground rules led to a Wil Myers home run to be called a double Tuesday night. Green said the matter was cleared up during a discussion with MLB's Joe Torre.  They misinterpreted our ground rule in New York last night, and I took responsibility,  Green said.  I wouldn't say the blame is on us, but we have to take some ownership over there being too much ambiguity, I guess, in the way our ground rule is written.

The combined value of buy-backs in January through May was around 2 trillion yen ($17.83 billion), down 50 percent from the year-ago period, according to Goldman Sachs Japan. In May, buy-backs totalled 898.8 billion yen, down 40 percent on year.  At high stock price levels, some companies are refraining from buying back their own shares,  said Makoto Sengoku, a market analyst at Tokai Tokyo Research Institute. The Nikkei stock index on June 20 touched 20,318.11, its loftiest since August 2015. Higher stock prices make it more expensive for companies to buy back their shares, and lessens their incentive to do so. Sengoku said that while some companies will use higher profits for investment, including for equipment, this may well be limited. Rather than buy back shares with extra cash, there is a strong possibility companies will  continue to return dividends to shareholders,  he said. But Reuters data showed total dividends have edged down slightly this year, compared to the previous year, despite a trend of higher profits. Growing Profitability Ministry of Finance data released this month showed company profits rose 26.6 percent in January-March from a year earlier, up for the third consecutive quarter. The amount of recurring profits, at 20.1 trillion yen, was the biggest on record for a January-March quarter. Shareholder returns of firms listed on the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, which include both buy-backs and dividends, totalled 17.7 trillion yen for the fiscal year through March, according to Goldman Sachs data. Although that was a record, the annual increase was only 3.4 percent, which Goldman strategists called a  disappointing result  after gains topped 20 percent in each of the two prior fiscal years.  While companies will of course need to allocate funds for growth, we think Japanese firms need to continue to take steps to increase shareholder returns,  they said. In addition to giving investors' return-on-equity a lift, a buy-back typically buoys a company's share price. Lately in Japan, though, such gains have not always outpaced those of the broader market. The Solactive Japanese Buyback Index tracks select Japanese companies that have announced share buy-backs in the past two months, and which have at least 100 billion yen in market capitalization and an average trading value of 300 million yen over three months. That index is up 4 percent this year, compared to the Nikkei stock index's 5.8 percent rise.

The rise in rates is itself a response to strengthening economic activity. But vigilance is still called for. Economies and markets ... could be thrown off balance if rates rise faster than expected,  Ravi Menon, managing director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) told reporters. Rising interest rates in the United States have been a major focus for financial markets this year, especially with wobbles in China's economy raising worries that global growth could falter if the Federal Reserve tightens policy too fast. The bigger concern in the event U.S. interest rates rise faster than what markets expect is the risk globally to households and companies that have grown accustomed to easy conditions, Menon said.  That is more worrisome because...when they get into trouble, that will have a more lasting economic impact than markets going through a few weeks of gyrations.  Besides the Fed, other advanced economies have also begun to switch gears. Bank of England Governor Mark Carney surprised many on Wednesday by conceding a hike was likely to be needed as the economy came closer to running at full capacity. The Bank of Canada went further, with two top policymakers suggesting they might tighten as early as July. That followed hawkish comments earlier in the week from European Central Bank President Mario Draghi. Turning to China, Singapore's biggest trading partner, Menon said the Asian giant is on a steady growth path. China has considerable buffers to deal with problems related to the high debt-to-GDP ratio in the country, he said, though addressing that issue will take time.  It takes many years for corporates, for governments, for households to unwind leverage, bring down debt levels relative to income, without tipping into serious problems.  Speaking after the release of the MAS's annual report, Menon said the current neutral stance of monetary policy - in place since April last year - remains appropriate for an extended period given the stable inflation and growth prospects. He reiterated that Singapore's export-reliant economy was forecast to grow by 1-3 percent this year, with a  strong likelihood  that growth would exceed last year's 2 percent. But Menon warned that authorities would not ease property market cooling measures as the market has shown some signs of recovery in recent months.  The property market has substantially stabilised over the last three years. It is, however, not time yet to ease the cooling measures,  Menon said.  Regional property markets have been buoyant and their respective authorities have... introduced further property cooling measures. Easing the measures now will send a wrong signal.  Private residential property prices in Singapore have fallen nearly 12 percent over the last 14 quarters, as the market cooled after the government implemented a series of property curbs since 2009.

China remained by far the main country of provenance for counterfeit products in the EU, with Hong Kong acting as a transit point for goods originally manufactured in China, Europol, the European Union's law enforcement agency said. The report is jointly issued by the European Union Intellectual Property office.  The report's accusations are irresponsible,  Commerce Ministry spokesman Sun Jiwen told reporters in Beijing.  The authenticity and objectivity of the statistics presented by the report should be further studied.  The report cited statistics from a U.S. Chamber of Commerce study which estimated that 72 percent of counterfeit goods in circulation in three of the world's largest markets for such products, namely the European Union, Japan and the United States, were exported from China in 2016. Counterfeit goods were estimated to have amounted to approximately 12.5 percent of China's total exports and over 1.5 percent of its gross domestic product in 2016, it said. Sun said China would continue its  intense crackdown  on intellectual property right violations, in particular exports of health-related consumer goods and materials for large-scale infrastructure investment.   The report also highlighted the growing use of cargo train transport between China and Europe as a concern. There are 39 lines connecting Europe with 16 Chinese cities, all offering freight services.  China's ambitious Belt and Road project, which would involve heavy investment transport infrastructure from China overseas in coming years, is also likely to increase the number of IPR-infringing consignments arriving at the eastern EU external borders by train, the report noted. China has touted the Belt and Road initiative as a new way to boost global development since Xi unveiled the plan in 2013, aiming to expand links between Asia, Africa, Europe and beyond underpinned by billions of dollars in infrastructure investment.

The Nikkei gained 0.45 percent to 20,220.30, moving closer to 20,318.11 hit last week, the highest level since August 2015. The broader Topix ended the day 0.6 percent higher at 1,624.07 after brushing a two-year high of 1,627.54. Tech shares, which stumbled the previous day, rebounded after the Nasdaq overnight posted its best session since Nov. 7. Gains in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index also bolstered sentiment in the Japanese tech sector. Advantest rose 0.8 percent, Hitachi Ltd added 1.3 percent and Shin-Etsu Chemical Co, a top maker of semiconductor silicon wafers, advanced 1 percent.  We see reversals in some sectors today. For the overall market, investors are still waiting for major catalysts from next week as well as this weekend's Tokyo poll,  said Nobuhiko Kuramochi, a strategist at Mizuho Securities, referring to Sunday's Tokyo Metropolitan assembly election. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's government, its ratings slipping over suspicions of favouritism, has suffered a fresh embarrassment after his defence minister made politically sensitive remarks just days ahead of a key local election.  It's not like the market is deeply worried about the election. But from foreign investors' standpoint, political stability was one of the reasons to invest in the Japanese market, so we don't want a negative surprise on the weekend,  Mizuho's Kuramochi said. Bucking Thursday's strength, Nitori Holdings tumbled 6.8 percent after the furniture retailer saw its operating profit decline 5.6 percent to 25.72 billion yen ($229 million) in March-May, hurt by a weaker yen and expenses related to new store openings.

The private equity firm is buying Staples for $6.9 billion. Handing over a near-20 percent premium for the struggling office supplies retailer looks foolhardy.  As at many other chains, the top line at Staples has been declining. The company’s revenue has fallen more than 7 percent over its last two fiscal years, and those declines are continuing. Staples posted an operating loss in its most recent year. According to Eikon, analysts are expecting revenue to fall for the next three years.  Sycamore's deal requires a fancy calculator to add up. Assume the buyers write a check for 30 percent of the deal's value, which would be lower than the average. If the company can then match analysts’ estimates for next year’s EBITDA of $1.3 billion and maintain that performance over five years, it could afford dividends of roughly $300 million a year.  Selling the company at the same 5.3 times EBITDA as the purchase price, and assuming no debt is paid down in the meantime, Sycamore would post a 15 percent annual return. That hardly gives the private equity firm much cushion if it can’t lure customers into buying more printers and post-it notes. But paying those dividends will be a stretch. The company currently has nine banks listed as financiers, suggesting that no single bank is willing to take on a lot of the deal risk. They will want the company to use free cash flow to pay down debt. If not, firms like Staples enter dangerous territory. The retail, restaurants, and consumer products sectors have accounted for a quarter of all defaults this year, according to S&P; Global Ratings. They comprised only a tenth at this point last year.  Most turnarounds require some investment. If Staples finds it must use most of its cash to pay off debt, it will struggle to nurse itself back to health. Sycamore can prod the company to pay dividends or invest in propping up EBITDA - but probably not both. The private equity firm is already elbows deep in trying to revive retail businesses. The paper shredders Staples sells may come in handy. BreakingviewsReuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

Schaeuble told reporters that Europe should abide by rules enacted after the 2008 collapse of U.S. financial services firm Lehman Brothers that were meant to protect taxpayers. Existing European Union guidelines for restructuring banks aimed to ensure  what all political groups wanted: that taxpayers will never again carry the risks of banks,  he said. Italy is transferring the good assets of the two Veneto lenders to the nation's biggest retail bank, Intesa Sanpaolo , as part of a transaction that could cost the state up to 17 billion euros ($19 billion). The deal, approved by the European Commission, allows Rome to solve a banking crisis on its own terms rather than under potentially tougher European rules. Noting that closure under national insolvency laws benefited owners and investors, Schaeuble said:  We in Europe need to think about this regulatory loophole.  Schaeuble's spokeswoman, Friederike von Tiesenhausen, on Monday urged the European Commission to enforce rules requiring state aid to be limited to a minimum in bankruptcy cases.

Support for the dollar eroded as investors realised the U.S. Federal Reserve might not be the only game in town when it came to higher interest rates. In Britain, Bank of England Governor Mark Carney surprised many by conceding a hike was likely to be needed as the economy came closer to running at full capacity. The Bank of Canada went further, with two top policymakers suggesting they might tighten as early as July. That followed comments earlier in the week from European Central Bank President Mario Draghi that stimulus might need to be toned down so it does not become more accommodative as the economy recovers. ECB sources tried to hose down the talk but could not stop the euro hitting a one-year high against the U.S. dollar.  If we want to know what the ECB is planning, we will choose a carefully scripted Draghi speech over anonymous sources every time,  said Westpac currency strategist Sean Callow.  Backed by the Eurozone's strong current account surplus and the contrast with a Fed which could pause on rate hikes for a while, the euro looks to be on target for $1.1500-1.1600.  On Thursday, the single currency had already pressed on to $1.1405 having climbed three percent in as many days. The euro also surged to a 16-month top on the yen as investors doubt the Bank of Japan will be in any position to begin winding back its stimulus for a long time to come. The Canadian dollar vaulted to C$1.3027, having enjoyed its biggest daily gain in three months, while sterling rebounded to $1.2961. Against a basket of major currencies, the dollar sank to its lowest since October at 95.754 as volatility returned with a vengeance. Traders at Citi called the currency reaction  extraordinary  with turnover as much as twice the daily average on Wednesday. Future Headwinds  Central banks will be very cautious in their approach,  said Martin Whetton, a senior rates strategist at ANZ.  But once they start tightening in concert, and their bloated balance sheets start unwinding, it is fair to say that bonds, equities, house prices and other asset markets will face stiffer headwinds than they have for a long time.  The squall had already driven German short-term yields to their highest in a year, while yields on U.S. 10-year Treasuries were up 11 basis points so far this week at 2.23 percent. Yet the prospect of higher interest rates also bolstered banking stocks and helped the S&P; 500 score its biggest one-day percentage gain in about two months on Wednesday. The Dow rose 0.68 percent, while the S&P; 500 gained 0.88 percent and the Nasdaq 1.43 percent. Financials gained further after hours as the Fed approved plans from the 34 largest U.S. banks to use extra capital for stock buy backs and dividends. Asia followed on Thursday with Japan's Nikkei adding 0.45 percent and Australia almost 1 percent. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.8 percent to its highest since May 2015. Eurostoxx futures gained 0.45 percent in early trade, while the FTSE added 0.54 percent. The weaker U.S. dollar helped boost commodities in general, with gold up 0.3 percent to $1,252.50 an ounce. Copper, lead and zinc prices hit near three-month highs on signs of tighter supply and optimism over Chinese demand. Oil recouped some of its recent steep losses after a weekly decrease in U.S. production offset a surprise build in crude inventories in the world's top oil consumer. On Thursday, U.S. crude firmed 24 cents to $44.98 per barrel and Brent added 22 cents to $47.53.

There are concerns in the financial community that assets are being mispriced because the full extent of climate risk is not being factored in, threatening market stability. As a result, demand is growing from investors, shareholders, lenders, underwriters and the public for more meaningful and transparent climate-related financial information. The TCFD said organizations should disclose their governance around climate risks and opportunities and the actual and potential impacts of those risks and opportunities on the business, strategy and financial planning, taking into account a global climate pact to limit global average temperature rise to below 2 degrees Celsius. They should also disclose the processes used to identify, assess and manage risks and opportunities and the metrics and targets used to assess and manage them. Although several disclosure frameworks have emerged to meet this demand, there is no single standardized framework across the Group of 20 leading economies. The Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) was set up by the G20's Financial Stability Board to provide such a framework to improve the ability to assess and price climate-related risk and opportunities. In a report, the TCFD developed recommendations for climate-related financial disclosures, applying to financial sector organizations, including banks, insurance companies, asset managers and asset owners.  The Task Force's recommendations have been developed by the market for the market,  said FSB chair Mark Carney, who is also the governor of the Bank of England.  Widespread adoption will provide investors, banks and insurers with that information, helping minimize the risk that market adjustments to climate change will be incomplete, late and potentially destabilizing,  he added. Although the guidelines are voluntary some of the board's 32 members would like them to become mandatory. It recommended organizations provide climate-related financial disclosures in their public annual financial filings. More than 100 business leaders and their companies, such as insurance groups AXA and Aviva, oil major Royal Dutch Shell, mining group BHP Billiton and Virgin Group, have committed to support the recommendations.  Investors are pleased to see this industry-led forum publish a robust framework applicable across all sectors and jurisdictions,  said Peter Damgaard Jensen, chief executive of Danish pension fund manager PKA and chair of the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change.  Greater climate-related financial disclosure in line with the TCFD's four widely adoptable recommendations is crucial to secure more complete, meaningful, reliable and consistent data across all companies and sectors,  he added.

The senators’ draft legislation, introduced last Thursday, will strip tens of millions of low-income and middle-class Americans of their health insurance. Millions more will face higher costs for lower coverage. The Congressional Budget office estimates 22 million more people will likely be uninsured by 2026 than would be if the Affordable Care Act remained law.  The Senate bill will cut the number of people eligible for subsidies that reduce monthly premiums and lower out-of-pocket costs for insurance bought on the Affordable Care Act health exchanges. It will defund Planned Parenthood for one year, which is an important source of preventive and primary care services for millions of low-income women and women of color. It strikes at the heart of health care services for the poor by ending Medicaid expansion in 2021 and changing the way states receive federal funding – another measure that will cause cuts in the program.  These cuts will be on top of the $600 billion that the president’s budget seeks to eliminate from the program over the next 10 years.  During his election campaign, Trump’s outreach to black voters effectively comprised the question “What do you have to lose?” That answer has become clear.  The president’s effort to repeal Obamacare, coupled with rollbacks in civil-rights enforcement and massive cuts to safety net programs, are moving the country backward. The Senate health bill is the latest in a string of efforts to dismantle programs and policies that benefit all Americans, and are especially critical in closing racial disparities in health, income, education, housing and policing.   MORE FROM REUTERS COMMENTARY Dan DePetris: Trump should go easy on North Korea over Warmbier death Peter Apps: The dangers of putting Putin under pressure Josh Cohen: How Trump can show he’s tough on anti-Semitism Protesters demonstrate against President Trump's plans to end Obamacare outside the White House in Washington, March 23, 2017.Kevin LamarqueThe administration’s effort to do away with the Affordable Care Act is at the top of the list of actions that will hit people of color hardest. Although every racial and ethnic group benefited from greater access to insurance, the reduction in the uninsured rate for African Americans, Native Americans and Latinos, was near double that experienced by whites in the first year the law took effect. Much of this improvement was because of Medicaid expansion under the Obama program.  The attack on Medicaid is especially concerning given its role in providing rural and urban children and families with access to health care. Medicaid covers one in five Americans, including poor adults, seniors and people with disabilities. Half of all births nationwide are covered by the program.  Beyond the assault on health care programs, the president’s budget will cut taxes for the wealthy and increase defense spending by $54 billion while slashing programs that provide help to low-income individuals, families and communities. It will cut billions of dollars from food and nutrition, housing, and community development programs that poor families and communities rely on to meet basic living needs.  The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program provides food stamps to help working families meet their nutritional needs. Funding for the program will be reduced by more than 25 percent, or $193 billion, over 10 years. The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, which provides federal funding for state-based income support and work programs for poor families, would be cut by $22 billion during the same period. And the Department of Housing and Urban Development’s budget will be slashed by nearly 15 percent or $7.4 billion. At a time the nation faces an affordable housing crisis, funding for homeless programs, direct rental assistance and home-buying programs are being drastically reduced.     If Trump has his way, other programs, such as the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program that helps pay for heat and electricity, and the Community Development Block Grant program that helps revitalize economically depressed neighborhoods will be eliminated.  The environmental justice program within the Environmental Protection Agency is also slated to be shut down. Low-income communities are more likely to have poorer air and water quality and have historically been targeted for dumping of toxic pollutants. Environmental justice initiatives have been key in remedying this imbalance. The Flint water crisis was an unfortunate reminder that our communities remain vulnerable to high levels of lead and other environmental inequities that have lasting impact on health.  The closing of the environmental justice office at EPA is part of the Trump administration’s broad strategy to reduce civil rights enforcement by federal agencies. The office of civil rights within the Education Department is also targeted for cuts and a similar office in the Labor Department will be eliminated.  Then there are the efforts to roll back Obama-era criminal justice reforms. Attorney General Jeff Sessions has called for harsher sentences for low-level drug offenders - again a measure that will disproportionately affect racial minorities. Blacks and Hispanics are more likely to be charged and to receive longer sentences than whites for similar crimes regardless of prior criminal history or severity of the crime. Despite similar rates of drug use, blacks are 10 times more likely to be incarcerated for drug use compared to whites. Sessions has also signaled that his Justice Department will not enforce consent decree agreements that have played a key role in holding police departments accountable for civil rights abuses – another area in which minority communities have been disproportionately singled out.   These policies are chipping away at the nation’s health and sustainability. The U.S. will be a minority-majority nation in a few decades. It is not in our national interest to marginalize Americans of color.    (Judy Lubin, PhD, MPH, is Director of Allies for Reaching Community Health Equity at the Center for Global Policy Solutions, co-founder of Sociologists of Justice and an ARCHE Public Voices Fellow of The OpEd Project.

China remained by far the main country of provenance for counterfeit products in the EU, with Hong Kong acting as a transit point for goods originally manufactured in China, Europol, the European Union's law enforcement agency said. The report is jointly issued by the European Union Intellectual Property office.  The report's accusations are irresponsible,  Commerce Ministry spokesman Sun Jiwen told reporters in Beijing.  The authenticity and objectivity of the statistics presented by the report should be further studied.  The report cited statistics from a U.S. Chamber of Commerce study which estimated that 72 percent of counterfeit goods in circulation in three of the world's largest markets for such products, namely the European Union, Japan and the United States, were exported from China in 2016. Counterfeit goods were estimated to have amounted to approximately 12.5 percent of China's total exports and over 1.5 percent of its gross domestic product in 2016, it said. Sun said China would continue its  intense crackdown  on intellectual property right violations, in particular exports of health-related consumer goods and materials for large-scale infrastructure investment.   The report also highlighted the growing use of cargo train transport between China and Europe as a concern. There are 39 lines connecting Europe with 16 Chinese cities, all offering freight services.  China's ambitious Belt and Road project, which would involve heavy investment transport infrastructure from China overseas in coming years, is also likely to increase the number of IPR-infringing consignments arriving at the eastern EU external borders by train, the report noted. China has touted the Belt and Road initiative as a new way to boost global development since Xi unveiled the plan in 2013, aiming to expand links between Asia, Africa, Europe and beyond underpinned by billions of dollars in infrastructure investment.

After a seven-year investigation prompted by scores of complaints from rivals, the European Commission hit Google with a record 2.4 billion euro ($2.73 billion) fine for favouring its own shopping service and an order to treat rival services the same way it treats its own products.  When I saw this yesterday, it absolutely rang a bell,  said Georg Berrisch, a partner at Baker Botts who advised Microsoft in its EU regulatory dispute while at another law firm. The European Commission slapped a 497 million euro fine on Microsoft in 2004 and ordered it to take steps to boost software competition. It failed to comply with that decision and was subsequently fined 899 million euros. In total, its battle with the EU in several other investigations cost it more than 2.2 billion euros in penalties. In an oblique reference to Microsoft, which faced nearly two decades of legal scrutiny for antitrust violations, Alphabet Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt told a 2011 U.S. Senate hearing:  We get it. By that I mean, we get the lessons of our corporate predecessors.  But Google has much to learn, said Stephen Kinsella at law firm Sidley Austin, who advises Google complainant and UK online shopping comparison website Kelkoo.  Years ago Google said they wouldn't make the mistakes that Microsoft did. Instead they made all of them and came up with a few of their own. The public statements yesterday show they still don't get it,  he said. Google said on Tuesday it disagreed with the EU's findings that it had abused its dominant position and was considering an appeal. It said it looked forward to continuing to make its case.  The real danger for Google is to enter into a prolonged battle with the Commission on whether what it has done is sufficient to comply with its decision. It could be quite expensive for Google in the end. This is not the end of the story,  Berrisch said. Underlining Google's task, the Commission on Wednesday published a tender for technical expertise to assist it with the case. The five-year contract is worth 10 million euros and can be renewed. So far, investors have given Google the benefit of the doubt, with Alphabet ranking just behind Apple as the world's most valuable stock with a $666 billion market capitalisation. But they are taking note.  The real concern is whether the Commission will manage to force Google to change its business model, its algorithms in a way that could be detrimental to the business,  said Wesley Lebeau, fund manager at CPR Asset Management, an Amundi company.  Search engine is still about 60 percent of Alphabet's valuation so that is a big deal, even though the drivers for future growth are YouTube and all the Alphabet companies -- Waymo, NEST, Verily,  he said. Tech titans have benefited so far from the perception that they bring benefits to society, said Freddie Lait, founder at Latitude Investment Management.  But there is a small chance that, if the shine wears off and you have more of these terrorist videos...and the fine is a huge fine, which sent a message to consumers that there's been wrongdoing,  he said.  If the shine comes off, the claws are out from regulators and governments to try and get their pound of flesh out of all of the big tech companies.

The consumer sentiment indicator, published by the Nuremberg-based GfK institute and based on a survey of around 2,000 Germans, rose to 10.6 going into July, the highest level since October 2001. A Reuters poll had expected an unchanged reading of 10.4, from last month, also a near 16-year high. GfK linked the high reading to income expectations reaching their highest level since reunification in 1990 as Germany's robust labour market continues to fuel consumption and growth.  The positive outlook for income growth among consumers is primarily based on the excellent condition of the labor market,  GfK researcher Rolf Buerkl said in a statement.  Employment is still growing noticeably. The number of people in employment is expected to rise by more than half a million this year.  Consumers also held very positive expectations of the economy, with a sub-index measuring their economic outlook reaching its highest level in almost three years.  Consumers believe that the boom in Germany is gaining traction despite global economic risks,  Buerkl said.  A weak euro, low oil prices and the European Central Bank's expansive monetary policy all ensure that the economic engine continues to gain pace.  He added that consumers appear unfazed by risks to the economy linked to possible U.S. trade restrictions and the beginning of divorce talks between Britain and the European Union. The Ifo economic institute said last week that vibrant domestic demand and strong export growth fueled by a recovery in the euro zone will boost growth in Germany this year and next, raising its 2017 growth forecast for Europe's largest economy. Ifo raised its growth forecast to 1.8 percent from 1.5 percent, adding that risks linked to Brexit negotiations and possible protectionist policies by U.S. President Donald Trump have receded since the start of the year.  An increasingly stable labour market with bright prospects for employment is the primary reason for the very good tendency to buy,  said Buerkl.  In addition, little fear of losing employment makes for a more secure basis to plan for the future.

John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) By John Kemp LONDON, June 28 (Reuters) - The 1980s film “WarGames” contains an important lesson for OPEC and shale producers about the futility of trying to manage the oil market. Released in 1983, the movie blended new concerns about home computers and hacking with older concerns about the accidental start of nuclear conflict and mutually assured destruction. In the film, the U.S. Air Force's new war-planning computer, which displays an early form of artificial intelligence called Joshua, runs simulations for global thermonuclear war, trying to find a way to win. But the game becomes deadly serious when the computer seizes control of the U.S. nuclear arsenal and attempts to launch a real missile attack against the Soviet Union. The film's hero, a young hacker, eventually teaches the computer a lesson in futility, forcing it to play tic-tac-toe, a game that has no winning strategy and always ends in a draw. The computer then applies the same lesson to its nuclear war simulations, realising there is no winner, only losers. The computer concludes global thermonuclear war is “A strange game. The only winning move is not to play” and stands down the missiles. In many ways, the renewed battle between OPEC and U.S. shale producers is similar to the self-defeating conflict portrayed in “WarGames”. If all oil producers try to maximise their output, the result is a glut of crude that depresses prices and proves ruinous for everyone. If one producer acts as swing producer and restricts output unilaterally, others increase their production to fill the gap, and the only result is a loss of market share. The only rational strategy is to avoid trying to manage production and allow prices to adjust to rebalance the market. Swing Producer? “I personally believe (the oil price) where we are right now is not sustainable,” Tim Dove, chief executive of Pioneer Resources, told a conference in New York on Tuesday. “It comes in the form of two words: Saudi Arabia. They cannot have a scenario, which is $43 or $44 (per barrel) oil, and sustain their national budgets.” As a result, Saudi Arabia would likely move to boost oil prices to protect its own finances, according to Dove (“U.S. shale CEO sees Saudi Arabia moving to lift oil prices”, Reuters, June 27). Despite the glut, Pioneer has no plans to curb its own drilling. “We’re not going to not drill because this very well may be the time where the well costs are as low as they’re ever going to be,” Dove said.  We can pare away and still be profitable even in a $45 (per barrel) environment,  he said.  We may just dial back at the margin in that scenario and not be a significant over-spender.  The gist of his argument was that someone would have to cut production to lift prices, but it would not be Pioneer, one of the most prominent shale drillers in the Permian Basin. Similar logic holds for all producers, but if they all carry on drilling, the result will be continued oversupply and a decline in prices. Dove seemed to think Saudi Arabia would act as a swing producer again, and in the process deliver a windfall for shale firms in the form of higher prices. But acting as a swing producer simply to protect rival shale firms from a renewed price drop would not be a rational strategy for Riyadh. The only rational strategy is to eschew the swing producer role and allow prices to decline to the point where the shale drilling boom is curbed. In this game, acting as a swing producer is futile, and the only winning move is not to play - as Saudi Arabia discovered the hard way during the 1980s and is rediscovering now. Since the start of the year, Saudi Arabia has given up market share, only to watch other producers increase their own output, and end up with prices no higher than before. Further production cuts by Saudi Arabia and the rest of OPEC would likely result in the same self-defeating outcome. Saudi Arabia and its OPEC and non-OPEC allies have committed themselves to restraining output to the end of March 2018. The production cuts have arguably backfired but the kingdom has good reason to stick with the plan to maintain its credibility. For the future, however, the rational course is to make clear that the cuts will not be renewed when they expire next year. Saudi Arabia and the others should commit to gradually normalising their production levels in the course of 2018 and abandoning output restraint. The result would likely be somewhat lower oil prices in the near term, but that would curb the shale boom and protect Saudi Arabia’s market share and revenues in the medium term.

There are concerns in the financial community that assets are being mispriced because the full extent of climate risk is not being factored in, threatening market stability. As a result, demand is growing from investors, shareholders, lenders, underwriters and the public for more meaningful and transparent climate-related financial information. The TCFD said organizations should disclose their governance around climate risks and opportunities and the actual and potential impacts of those risks and opportunities on the business, strategy and financial planning, taking into account a global climate pact to limit global average temperature rise to below 2 degrees Celsius. They should also disclose the processes used to identify, assess and manage risks and opportunities and the metrics and targets used to assess and manage them. Although several disclosure frameworks have emerged to meet this demand, there is no single standardized framework across the Group of 20 leading economies. The Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) was set up by the G20's Financial Stability Board to provide such a framework to improve the ability to assess and price climate-related risk and opportunities. In a report, the TCFD developed recommendations for climate-related financial disclosures, applying to financial sector organizations, including banks, insurance companies, asset managers and asset owners.  The Task Force's recommendations have been developed by the market for the market,  said FSB chair Mark Carney, who is also the governor of the Bank of England.  Widespread adoption will provide investors, banks and insurers with that information, helping minimize the risk that market adjustments to climate change will be incomplete, late and potentially destabilizing,  he added. Although the guidelines are voluntary some of the board's 32 members would like them to become mandatory. It recommended organizations provide climate-related financial disclosures in their public annual financial filings. More than 100 business leaders and their companies, such as insurance groups AXA and Aviva, oil major Royal Dutch Shell, mining group BHP Billiton and Virgin Group, have committed to support the recommendations.  Investors are pleased to see this industry-led forum publish a robust framework applicable across all sectors and jurisdictions,  said Peter Damgaard Jensen, chief executive of Danish pension fund manager PKA and chair of the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change.  Greater climate-related financial disclosure in line with the TCFD's four widely adoptable recommendations is crucial to secure more complete, meaningful, reliable and consistent data across all companies and sectors,  he added.

Much of the increase in LNG capacity is because of the rapid boost to plants in Australia and the United States, as both countries take advantage of abundant local reserves of natural gas to muscle in on a market that until recently had been dominated by a few established producers and buyers. But it is perhaps ironic that while the action on the capacity side of LNG is an Australian and American story, the ultimate controlling player of the emerging global natural gas market is likely to be Europe. This is because Europe is likely to act as a  clearing house  for surplus LNG cargoes, given it has excess re-gasification capacity and the ability to use the fuel for a variety of purposes, from power generation to manufacturing to household heating. Europe is also the only region that can effectively arbitrage between LNG and pipeline prices, given its connection to Russian and other Eastern natural gas via pipelines. The continent is also best-placed to use market forces to find a price level for natural gas versus its competitors, given it still has substantial coal-fired power in some countries as well as being a leader in renewables such as wind and solar. To understand Europe's role in the LNG market, it's worth examining how the dynamics of trade in the super-chilled fuel are changing with the rise of Australia and the United States. LNG has traditionally been an opaque and tightly-controlled market, where a small number of exporters signed long-term, oil-linked contracts with an equally small number of buyers, who were more concerned about energy security than price. The major producers included Qatar, Indonesia and Malaysia, while the top buyers were concentrated in North Asia, namely Japan and South Korea, and also in Europe. It was inevitable that this situation would be disrupted once global energy giants such as Chevron, Royal Dutch Shell, ConocoPhillips and Exxon Mobil decided to pour some $200 billion into developing eight new LNG projects in Australia. Three of these are ground-breaking ventures based on using coal-seam gas as feedstock, one is the biggest floating LNG project and the rest are conventional offshore gas to onshore liquefaction plants. When the last of these new plants is operating, most likely by 2018, Australia will have around 80 million tonnes of annual LNG capacity, overtaking Qatar as the top exporter of the fuel. Not far behind Australia on the development scale is the United States, with 16 million tonnes of LNG capacity already operating at the Sabine Pass facility in the Gulf of Mexico. A further 60.5 million tonnes of annual capacity is under construction, and will arrive from late in 2017 to the end of 2019, with the bulk scheduled to be commissioned in 2018. Lng the Last to Boom and Bust? The International Gas Union (IGU), the industry's lobby group, said in its annual review in April that there was 340 million tonnes of LNG capacity as at the end of 2016, and a further 114 million tonnes under construction as of the start of this year. In some ways, LNG is the last cab off the rank in the commodity boom that saw massive capacity expansions in iron ore, coal and crude oil as part of the recovery from the 2008 global recession. Much of the investment in commodity projects was driven by the belief that China, the world's top commodity consumer and importer, would continue to soak up everything the world could throw at it. As can be seen from the five years of price declines for coal and iron ore from 2011 to 2015, this was a forlorn hope, even though China has continued to increase its imports of natural resources. LNG is equally likely to move into an oversupply situation by 2020, notwithstanding increased imports by China and the emergence of new buyers in Asia, such as Pakistan and Singapore. It's this oversupply dynamic that is changing the way LNG is traded, with buyers no longer willing to lock into long-term contracts linked to the price of crude oil. While it will take several years for these contracts to disappear entirely, buyers are having success in negotiating shorter-term deals, or even taking more spot cargoes. As a consequence, the spot price of LNG in Asia LNG-AS has plummeted in recent years. From a record $20.50 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) in February 2014, LNG was last at $5.40 in the week to June 23, down nearly 75 percent. The drop in Asian spot LNG prices has led them to converge with prices in Europe, with the British National Balancing Point (NBP) price actually exceeding the Asian spot price in May and June last year, according to the IGU. The difference between the two benchmarks averaged just 91 cents per mmBtu in 2016, the IGU said, showing how dramatically the Asian premium has narrowed in recent years, having been as high as $6 per mmBtu at the end of 2013. Front-month NBP futures ended at the equivalent of $4.88 per mmBtu on June 28, meaning spot the Asian LNG price commanded a premium of just 52 U.S. cents. Benchmark U.S. Henry Hub natural gas futures were at $3.067 per mmBtu on June 28, showing that the three main regional benchmarks are fairly close to each other. This becomes even more the case when the approximately $1.50 per mmBtu cost of liquefaction, already included in the spot Asian price, is added to the NBP and Henry Hub prices. The economics of the LNG market then come down to shipping costs across various routes, and it's here that Europe comes into its own. It's highly unlikely that Australian LNG will flow to the Atlantic Basin, given the long sea voyage, which adds to the cost but also increases the loss from boil-off of the LNG being shipped. This means Australian LNG will have to find a home in Asia, either among traditional buyers or emerging markets in Southeast Asia, where its geographic position gives it an advantage over Qatar and producers in Africa or the United States. The swing supplier will likely be the United States, which can ship to both Europe and Asia, as well as Latin America. It's also likely that Qatar may feel increasing pressure in Asia as it has to compete with new Australian supplies, meaning it either has to find new buyers in East Asia or push more cargoes westward to Europe. Flows Show Changing World The new dynamics of LNG trade can already be seen in flows around the world. In 2016, 278.9 million tonnes of LNG moved by ship globally, according to vessel-tracking and port data compiled by Thomson Reuters, a 7.6 percent hike from the 259.2 million  shipped the prior year. Of that total, 41.7 million tonnes went to Europe, while 156.5 million went to North Asia, which includes Japan, South Korea and China, and 33.2 million was shipped to the rest of Asia. Back in 2013 total LNG trade stood at 243.9 million tonnes, with 38.5 million going to Europe, 151.5 million to North Asia and 17.7 million to the rest of Asia. What this shows is that Europe and North Asia grew slowly in the past four years, while emerging Asia surged on the back of rising imports by India and newer buyers such as Singapore and Pakistan, and even by traditional exporters like Malaysia. Looking at the breakdown by exporting country shows that Australia has gone from shipping 23.7 million tonnes in 2013 to 46.1 million in 2016. Of Australian shipments in 2016, 39.6 million tonnes went to North Asia, up from 21.4 million in 2013. Qatar shipped 34.7 million tonnes to North Asia in 2016, down from 40.5 million in 2013. It seems clear that Australia is supplanting Qatar as the main supplier to North Asian markets, a trend that's likely to continue as the Pacific nation brings another 40 million tonnes of LNG capacity on line by 2018. Qatar has had success in boosting its shipments to the rest of Asia and to Europe, but it will also face pressure in those markets. Australia has gone from shipping 65,900 tonnes, or just one cargo, to the rest of Asia in 2013 to supplying 3.1 million tonnes in 2016, and it's likely that its producers, especially those on the northwest coast, will be trying to gain a bigger foothold in markets like India and Sri Lanka. Overall, the global LNG market is becoming more competitive, driven by increased supply and buyer demands for more flexibility. These trends are set to continue in the coming years, creating a far larger spot market and likely seeing the demise of restrictive destination clauses and oil-linked pricing. It's also the case that much of the demand growth for LNG will be concentrated in Asia, but that doesn't necessarily mean the region will become the hub for LNG. The main problem in establishing an LNG trading hub is that the fuel isn't just simply a natural gas version of crude oil. Long-term storage is problematic given the boil-off that occurs when LNG is placed in land-based tanks or on ships. While newer LNG vessels can use boil-off as fuel for the engines, it's unlikely that LNG can be stored and traded multiple times, as is currently common in crude oil. Singapore would like to become Asia's LNG hub, but this would require massive infrastructure investment and the development of a regional pipeline system that would allow LNG to be re-gasified and then transported and stored. While this may happen over time, the absence of storage and interconnecting pipelines across Asia limits the continent's chances of being the centre of the LNG universe. Rather, it's Europe with its plentiful re-gasification capacity and pipeline and storage infrastructure that can play that role. Among European countries, Spain has the best potential as an LNG hub, given its proximity to Qatar (through the Suez canal), West and North African producers and the United States. Spain has 49 million tonnes per annum in re-gasification capacity, but only 21 percent of this was being utilised in January this year, according to the IGU. Elsewhere in Europe, Britain has 35 million tonnes of re-gasification but, like Spain, only 21 percent was in use in January. In contrast Japan's 197 million tonnes of capacity had a utilisation rate of 43 percent, South Korea's 101 million tonnes was used at 35 percent and China's 49 million tonnes at 56 percent. While it's clear that the big buyers in North Asia can take more LNG, it's also obvious that Spain and Britain can take substantially more LNG. They also have the means to use the natural gas, while demand in both Japan and South Korea has been largely steady in recent years, although China is witnessing strong growth. Overall, when the rest of Australia's LNG hits the market, it will likely push more Qatari cargoes to Europe. As the U.S. LNG comes on stream, it can choose whether to got to Europe or Asia depending on the price. Europe will become the destination of last resort for an increasing number of spot LNG cargoes, meaning it gets to set the price that determines where the fuel goes. Despite being a substantially smaller market than Asia, Europe will become the kingmaker in LNG. Editing by Richard Pullin","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/column-russell-lng-idUSL3N1JD1QC"},

Chinese authorities have launched a broad campaign to control political opinion and formalise online surveillance mechanisms, cracking down on online content including literature, livestreaming, news and social media accounts.  Last week, the media watchdog, the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television, threatened to close Weibo's video service along with two other popular services, ACFUN and iFeng. In a statement posted on its website late on Wednesday, Weibo said it  sincerely accepted the criticism , and would immediately begin work to remove  political, media and current affairs video accounts from outlets that lack a license. Weibo added that it will strengthen cooperation with the country's top three state media outlets - Xinhua news agency, China Central Television and the People's Daily - and work to promote outlets that represent mainstream political ideas. Unlicensed television and film content, as well as videos longer than 15 minutes, will be banned on the platform, it said.  Television and film producers in China are legally required to submit content for approval, a regulation that has increasingly targeted the country's extensive and fast-growing online film industry. China's cyberspace authorities ordered internet companies earlier this month to close 60 popular celebrity gossip social media accounts to help  actively propagate core socialist values  and prop up  mainstream public opinion . Shares in Weibo and Sina Corp, which has a stake in Weibo, have fallen since the watchdog issued its warning last week, but are still up nearly 160 percent over the last year.

Despite veteran Matt Holliday being placed on the 10-day disabled list, New York's youngsters helped Masahiro Tanaka end his eight-start winless skid with a 12-3 victory against the Chicago White Sox Aaron Judge smashed his 27th home run and rookie Miguel Andujar went 3-for-4 with four RBIs in his major league debut, hours after arriving from Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barres. Rookie Tyler Wade, who was recalled Tuesday, also picked up his first major league hit.  There's a lot of excitement,  Yankees manager Joe Girardi said.  We saw a lot of talent in spring training, when those guys would play, and I think those guys being a big part of our success in spring training probably helped them in this situation.  Andujar drove in two with a two-out single in the first inning and doubled home two in the ninth. Related CoveragePreview: Yankees at White SoxNew York Yankees - PlayerWatchChicago White Sox - PlayerWatch What an amazing day,  Andujar said through an interpreter.  I'm never going to forget this day. I'm super happy to be here, to play with these guys here, have the opportunity to contribute and get a victory.'' Judge went 1-for-3 with two walks and crushed a two-run homer in the sixth that gave the Yankees (42-34) an 8-2 lead. It capped a five-run inning that included three doubles and a single, all against White Sox reliever Jake Petricka. Tanaka (6-7) went 0-6 with a 7.19 ERA in his previous eight starts. He picked up his first win since May 8 at the Cincinnati Reds by striking out five in six innings. White Sox left-hander Carlos Rodon, who was activated from the 60-day disabled list Wednesday morning, took the loss in his first start of the season. He allowed two hits and three runs (none earned), but issued six of Chicago's season-high 10 walks.  It was just good to be back on the mound,  Rodon said.  A little rough in the first and the second. Walks didn't help. Good team defense, really, got me through the fifth.  Melky Cabrera went 2-for-4 with two RBIs and Adam Engel was 2-for-3 with a home run for Chicago (33-44). The Yankees also scored three runs in the first and four in the ninth. They got on the board first with three runs in the first inning, aided by three of Rodon's walks and a throwing error by shortstop Tim Anderson. Andujar had the big hit in the inning -- a two-out, two-run single to make it 3-0 in his first major league plate appearance. Andujar also had a two-out single in the third that nearly plated a run, but was denied a third career RBI by left fielder Melky Cabrera's throw to get Chase Headley trying to score from second.  Going out there for the first at-bat, I felt a little nervous,  Andujar said.  It was my first at-bat in the big leagues. But then following that at-bat, everything was normal again.  The White Sox cut it to 3-2 with two runs in the fifth against Tanaka, who allowed the first three hitters to reach -- on a single by Omar Narvaez, a double by Engel and a walk to Yolmer Sanchez. Cabrera brought home Narvaez and Engel with a two-out single, but Chicago was unable to get the tying run home despite a first-and-third threat.  (It's nice) having (Rodon) back in the rotation and getting him back out there on the big league field, coming out of there feeling good (and) healthy,  White Sox manager Rick Renteria said.  I'm sure he will continue to get better as he continues to get out there and move forward.  NOTES: The Yankees placed OF Matt Holliday on the 10-day disabled list with a viral infection. He flew back to New York for further evaluation. Miguel Andujar was recalled from Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre to replace Holliday. ... The Yankees outrighted 1B/DH Chris Carter to Scranton/Wilkes-Barre. ... Yankees INF Tyler Austin (hamstring) didn't play and might be headed for the disabled list. ...

In the Philippines ... surface mining or 'open-pit' is technically and financially feasible,  Larry Heradez, head of the Mines and Geosciences Bureau's legal division, told reporters on Thursday. It was the first time a government official has countered a policy previously issued by Lopez, who was dismissed last month.  A staunch environmentalist, Lopez led a 10-month mining crackdown, ordering the closure or suspension of 26 mines in the world's top nickel ore supplier and imposing a ban on open-pit mining, which she said  kills the economic potential of the place.  Heradez is part of a team that is reviewing Lopez's policy orders, including the cancellation of 75 contracts for undeveloped mines to protect watersheds.  Some of the 75 contracts may still be canceled, he said,  not because the projects are within watersheds but because of possible violations like non-payment of taxes and non-implementation of work program.  Once the team has completed its review of all previous policy orders and made recommendations, they will be submitted to Lopez's replacement, Environment Secretary Roy Cimatu, who then  can revise or amend or supersede  them. Cimatu, who took over on May 8, has been taking a slow approach towards mining. He said on Tuesday he may decide in July what to do about the mining operations and contracts that Lopez ordered closed, suspended or canceled. The former military chief told Reuters in May it was possible to strike a balance between mining and natural resources, signaling his intent to settle a dispute that has been one of the biggest economic conundrums of President Rodrigo Duterte's presidency.

The two have been feuding bitterly over the $18 billion sale, particularly after Toshiba chose a different consortium as it is preferred bidder. Western Digital, which jointly runs Toshiba's main semiconductor plant, has sought a U.S. court injunction to prevent the inking of any deal without its consent.  On Wednesday Toshiba struck back with a lawsuit, saying Western Digital had interfered in the sale without due cause, adding that it is seeking 120 billion yen ($1 billion) in damages.

Georgia Power/Handout viaFile PhotoIt also blocked certain Western Digital employees from accessing databases related to their joint ventures and, in some cases, facilities as well.  This action will have the consequence of harming not only Toshiba's stakeholders, but also our respective customers,  Western Digital said in a statement. The U.S. firm called Toshiba's lawsuit a bid to pressure it to relinquish its consent rights, and added it was confident it would succeed on the legal merits of its arbitration request. Western Digital also reiterated its commitment to invest in their joint ventures, including the Fab 6 production line in Yokkaichi, central Japan.   Toshiba is rushing to sell the unit to cover billions of dollars in cost overruns at its bankrupt Westinghouse nuclear unit.

Wall Street stocks rose sharply on Wednesday, with the benchmark S&P; 500 index scoring its biggest one-day percentage gain in about two months, as financial and technology shares led a broad market rebound.     Crude oil prices rose for a sixth straight session to its highest since June 19 on a decline in U.S. output, but ongoing worries about global oversupply continued to drag.      Last week, there was concern with lower-than-expected inventories and so forth. Now that oil prices have stabilized, the market is reacting positively,  said Victor Felix, an equity analyst with AB Capital Securities.      Singapore shares advanced more than other markets in the region in percentage terms, rising as much as 1.1 percent to post their biggest intraday percentage gain since May 2.     The financial sector lifted the index, with DBS Group Holdings, Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp and United Overseas Bank posting gains in the range of 1.4 percent to 2.1 percent.      Thai shares rose 0.3 percent, with Airports of Thailand up 1.6 percent and Siam Commercial bank rising 1 percent.     Vietnam shares gained 0.4 percent, pushed up by financial stocks.      Bucking the trend, Philippine shares fell 0.3 percent, dragged by SM Prime Holdings and International Container Terminal Services which slid 1.7 percent and 2.3 percent, respectively.       For the past two months we had seen steady net foreign buying; it pushed our market up from 7,500 to the 8,000 level. Now we are seeing some selling pressure from foreign investors possibly because of high valuations. Another reason may be geo-political instability,  Felix added.      The Philippine peso is weakening against the dollar. That is also putting pressure on equities.      The peso has been one of the worst performing emerging Asian currencies this year, weakening more than 1 percent against the dollar year-to-date.

Chinese authorities have launched a broad campaign to control political opinion and formalise online surveillance mechanisms, cracking down on online content including literature, livestreaming, news and social media accounts.  Last week, the media watchdog, the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television, threatened to close Weibo's video service along with two other popular services, ACFUN and iFeng. In a statement posted on its website late on Wednesday, Weibo said it  sincerely accepted the criticism , and would immediately begin work to remove  political, media and current affairs video accounts from outlets that lack a license. Weibo added that it will strengthen cooperation with the country's top three state media outlets - Xinhua news agency, China Central Television and the People's Daily - and work to promote outlets that represent mainstream political ideas. Unlicensed television and film content, as well as videos longer than 15 minutes, will be banned on the platform, it said.  Television and film producers in China are legally required to submit content for approval, a regulation that has increasingly targeted the country's extensive and fast-growing online film industry. China's cyberspace authorities ordered internet companies earlier this month to close 60 popular celebrity gossip social media accounts to help  actively propagate core socialist values  and prop up  mainstream public opinion . Shares in Weibo and Sina Corp, which has a stake in Weibo, have fallen since the watchdog issued its warning last week, but are still up nearly 160 percent over the last year.

Rio Tinto Chairman Jan du Plessis said funds from the sale had yet to be allocated within the company amid some calls by shareholders to use the money to boost dividends or buy back shares.

Rio Tinto, which has dual primary stock listings in Australia and Britain, confirmed Yancoal as the preferred buyer on June 26 after Yancoal topped Glencore's offer of $2.675 billion.  Votes were held in London and Australia because Yancoal is deemed a related party to one of Rio Tinto's major shareholders, China-backed Chinalco. Yancoal is a 78 percent-owned subsidiary of Yanzhou Coal Mining Co, which is 56 percent owned and controlled by a Chinese state-owned enterprise, Yankuang Group.  Rio Tinto's London shareholders voted on Tuesday. Both Yancoal and Glencore were forced to increase their offers above most analysts' valuations of about $2 billion to remain in the running. Before the votes, Rio Tinto highlighted a range of advantages in the Yancoal offer, which it said included a better chance of completion coupled with a $225 million break fee. Importantly, according to analysts, Rio Tinto also said the Yancoal offer included  a faster and more certain timetable , closing the transaction in the third quarter of 2017.

Sentiment was also boosted by easing fears of a quarter-end liquidity crunch in the banking system, as well as a rise in the yuan, which reduced concers about capital outflows. Hong Kong shares also rose on bets that the Chinese government would unveil supportive policies as President Xi Jinping visits the former British colony to commemorate the 20th anniversary of Hong Kong's handover to China on July 1. China's blue-chip CSI300 index was up 0.4 percent at 3,659.65 points by the midday break, while the Shanghai Composite Index had gained 0.3 percent, to 3,183.21 points. The raw material sector firmed 0.9 percent as global commodity prices rose on the back of a weaker U.S. dollar. Aluminium Corp rose about 2 percent, China Molybdenum increased more than 3 precent and copper maker Jiangxi Copper firmed 1 percent.  The weaker dollar benefited China's commodity-related stocks in an indirect way,  said Chen Yong, analyst at Lianxun Securities.  Besides, a strengthening yuan eases capital outflow fears.  Reflecting the dollar's broad weakness, China's yuan rose against the dollar on Thursday to its highest level in seven and-a-half months. Receding fears of capital outflows from China added to relief that China's banking system does not appear to be suffering from a cash shortage at the end of the second quarter, as some had feared. Citing  relatively high  liquidity, China's central bank skipped open market operations for the fifth day in a row on Thursday. Shares in China's coal miners were particularly strong, as the country said it will ban coal imports at small ports from July 1, boosting China's coking coal futures. Shanxi Coking surged the maximum allowed 10 percent, while Shanxi Xishan Coal and Electricity Power jumped nearly 5 percent. Hong Kong Hong Kong stocks also strengthened. The Hang Seng index increased 0.9 percent to 25,910.58 points, while the Hong Kong China Enterprises Index gained 0.2 percent to 10,423.34. Financial shares rose sharply on expectations that China will announce more measures to link its markets with Hong Kong's benefiting investment banks and brokerages. Index heavyweight HSBC rose more than 4 percent, as Morgan Stanley upgraded the stock to  overweight  from  equal weight . The second board, which has dropped sharply this week as investors dumped penny stocks, slipped a modest 0.37 percent, although that is enough to set it up for a record low close.

The June 21 letter was written by Jun Fujimoto ahead of an annual meeting of Universal shareholders on Thursday at which Okada lost his position as board chairman. Shareholders approved a slate of directors that did not include Okada, a company spokesman confirmed. The meeting was not open to the media. The board shake-up comes three weeks after Universal announced that it had established an internal investigative panel to probe Okada’s use of company money. Universal said it had found three cases in which Okada misappropriated a total of $20 million in funds. Okada addressed those allegations for the first time on Thursday on the sidelines of the meeting in a Tokyo hotel. Okada made the comments after being told he could not attend the meeting because his stake in Universal is held indirectly by a holding company.   I've done nothing wrong,  Okada told reporters.  I've been barred from the meeting in the name of this investigative panel and allegations that are a bunch of nonsense.  Universal said it could not comment on letters to or from Fujimoto as an individual and declined to make him available for an interview. Peppered with criticism of Okada, the letter offers a glimpse into the mindset of Fujimoto, 59, as he pushes ahead with an attempt to sideline Okada, 74, in a rare Japanese boardroom coup.   I think Chairman Okada is unfit to be in management of a public company,  Fujimoto said in the letter, which was written in Japanese.  I'm confident that I can prove that with irrefutable physical evidence.  He did not say what that evidence was.  The approved slate of directors included Okada's wife, Takako. Universal also brought back a former finance executive and added an external director to the board.  The logo of the Universal Entertainment Corp. is seen at the company's headquarters in Tokyo November 30, 2012.Toru HanaiThose changes were made possible by the resignation of Okada in May as director of Okada Holdings Ltd, a company based in Hong Kong that owns 69 percent of Universal's stock and therefore holds sway over appointments to Universal's board. Okada stepped down as the result of a rift with family members, who control a majority of Okada Holdings' stock, Reuters reported on Wednesday. Fujimoto was responding to a letter from shareholder Tsuyoshi Hosoba, who had unsuccessfully sued Universal directors in 2015 alleging they breached their fiduciary duties on a series of matters, including in relation to $40 million in payments from affiliates of Universal in 2010 to a Philippine consultant, who was working on the company's $2.4 billion casino on Manila Bay. Slideshow (2 Images)Okada, Fujimoto and Universal have denied any wrongdoing related to the payments, which have been the subject of regulatory scrutiny in the U.S. and the Philippines. Hosoba declined to comment. In his letter, Hosoba said he wanted to work with Fujimoto to  clean up  the company and offered to cease further legal action if Fujimoto  told the truth  about the payments and took steps to bolster corporate governance. In response, Fujimoto rejected Hosoba's request to cooperate but urged him to consider the steps he was taking to improve the company's compliance and the risks directors and executives were taking in investigating the  extremely powerful  Okada. Fujimoto criticized Hosoba's threat of legal action as misguided. In the letter, Fujimoto said the investigation into Okada would look at transactions going back five years. That means the review would not include the $40 million paid to the Manila-based consultant in 2010. The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation has been probing the $40 million to determine if it was aimed at helping Universal gain tax and ownership concessions for its casino in the Philippines, according to the people with knowledge of the probe. Universal and Okada filed a defamation lawsuit against Reuters in 2012 for its reporting on the payments. The Tokyo District Court ruled in 2015 that Universal's case was without merit. Last year the Tokyo High Court upheld that ruling, dismissing Universal's appeal. Universal has appealed to the Supreme Court of Japan.

Trump visits Poland for one day - en route to a G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany - to take part in a gathering of leaders from central Europe, Baltic states and the Balkans, an event convened by Poland to bolster regional trade and infrastructure. Brussels diplomats view the July 6 gathering, dubbed the Three Seas summit because the countries involved border the Baltic, Black and Adriatic seas, as a Polish bid to carve out influence outside the European Union with which the nationalist government has repeatedly clashed. Trump plans to promote U.S. natural gas exports to the leaders from central and eastern Europe, a region heavily reliant on Russian supplies, his top economic adviser said. Poland received its first shipment of U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) this month.      Most diplomats in Brussels dismiss the importance of the Three Seas project, co-hosted by Croatia, but are wary over Trump's high-profile visit to participate in a project one senior EU official called Poland's push towards  self-ghettoisation .  One cannot but feel a bit suspicious if it isn't an attempt to break up European unity,  another EU diplomat said about the Three Seas project.  Poland's ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party has played a major role in fuelling a deepening rift between ex-communist and Western members of the European Union, at a time when the bloc is struggling with the aftermath of Britain's decision to leave. Since winning a parliamentary election in 2015, the PiS has angered France over a canceled army procurement deal, brought relations with Germany to their worst in nearly a decade, and is facing EU action over what critics call its authoritarian tilt. Poland is one of the leading voices in the region against migration, a view it shares with Trump alongside a disregard for climate change and suspicion of international bodies.  A Madness of Elites  Underscoring Warsaw's mistrust towards the EU, Prime Minister Beata Szydlo recently called an EU quotas policy for relocation of refugees from the Middle East  a madness of Brussels elites , in a speech in parliament.  In turn, EU leaders delivered a snub to Poland's government by steamrolling its objections and reappointing former Polish premier Donald Tusk to chair summits. Szydlo, acting on orders from party boss and long-time Tusk adversary Jaroslaw Kaczynski, had vowed to stop him securing a second 30-month term.  Warsaw portrayed the issue as one of fundamental principle, in which vital national interests had been ignored by a Brussels machine dominated by  German diktat . Its crushing defeat showed how far the biggest of the ex-communist states that joined the EU after the Cold War appears isolated, even in Eastern Europe. Deeply distrustful of Moscow, Poland hopes Trump, who once called NATO  obsolete , will reconfirm his commitment to the alliance's military build-up in eastern Europe, a deterrence policy against Russia, and possibly promise more. The United States has about 900 troops on Polish soil as part of a rotating NATO contingent in eastern Europe. Nato and Trump But Western diplomats are wary that Trump could use his trip to Warsaw to repeat criticism of Europe's low defense spending, which has irritated many Western leaders.  Trump denounced some NATO members' failure to meet a joint target of two percent of economic output, at a meeting of alliance leaders in Brussels last month. Poland, alongside the United States, is one of the few members who meet the goal.  We are not sure what Trump's message is going to be ... If he is here to reinforce Washington's commitment to (NATO's mutual defense principle)? Great!,  one EU diplomat said.  What if he makes it conditional, to be based on meeting the ... spending goal? This would cause a lot of damage.  Diplomatic observers who watch Washington say Trump may want to use the trip to deliver a message that he is serious about countering threats from Russia.   Most of the countries (at the Warsaw summit) see Russia as their main security threat and most strongly support NATO and would like a stronger U.S. force presence in their countries,  said Heather Conley, who was a State Department official in the George W. Bush administration.  Get Out and Travel  Some western European officials view Trump's nod to the Warsaw government as counter-productive at a time when European unity is wavering.  We encourage Mr Trump to get out and travel as much as he can. He needs to understand Europe and he can do that by getting out and speaking to people, to European leaders,  said one European official, who declined to be named.  (But) he can't do deals with individual countries over the head of the European Union,  he said.  In Hamburg, he will hear different arguments, we can clear up anything that has been misconstrued.   Poland has expressed hopes Trump can persuade U.S. business to invest in a network of north-south rail and road links central to the regional initiative, something U.S. diplomats and many economists dismiss as unrealistic. Much commerce in eastern Europe is done along east-west trade routes rather than between north and south, to a large degree a reflection of German economic dominance. Some governments in the east may also view Poland's ambitions of regional leadership with suspicion, cautious not to damage relations with trade partners in Berlin.  We are monitoring it,  said a Czech government source.  But we don't put much weight on it at the moment.

Investors have been told that anyone offering below 25.50 euros a share risks being left empty handed, the sources said. The price range was set at 22.00 to 25.50 euros a share and trading is expected to start on Friday. A successful listing for Delivery Hero is important for German e-commerce investor Rocket Internet (RKET.DE), which holds a 35 percent stake in the firm and has failed to bring a company to market since 2014. Meanwhile, New York-based Blue Apron Holdings (APRN.N), the online meal-kit company that is targeting similar investors to Delivery Hero, cut its valuation expectations for its IPO by a third amid concerns about the impact of Amazon.com's (AMZN.O) deal to buy Whole Foods (WFM.O). A person close to the Delivery Hero IPO stressed the differences, arguing that Blue Apron's subscription-based business model was less attractive than that of Delivery Hero, which generates income by taking a commission on meal orders. Rocket Internet's meal kit company HelloFresh has a similar business model to Blue Apron. HelloFresh is also preparing for a flotation as early as this autumn if the Delivery Hero listing is successful, sources have told Reuters. Delivery Hero has said it would use the proceeds to pay off debt and for organic growth and acquisitions as it seeks to stave off rising competition. The listing is expected to value the company at up to 4.4 billion euros.  The online takeaway business has been booming in recent years, prompting listings of firms such as Britain's Just Eat (JE.L) and the Netherlands' Takeaway.com (TKWY.AS), as well as the more recent entry of Amazon (AMZN.O) and Uber [UBER.UL]. However, online food delivery is seen as a  winner takes all  game as most users usually only download and use one app, meaning there is only enough space in most markets for one or two major players, underlining the need to build scale quickly.  When people have decided for a certain website they will stick to that,  Jitse Groen, chief executive of Takeaway.com which is fighting for market leadership with Delivery Hero in Germany, said last week. Delivery Hero says it is market leader in 35 of the more than 40 countries it operates in in Europe, the Middle East, North Africa, Latin America and Asia Pacific, and the total market it has access to is worth 72 billion euros.

Under the deal, the lenders, led by Anchorage Capital, who own more than three-fourths of the beleaguered company's secured debt, will get 95 percent of the company's equity, the company said in a statement. Some of the existing secured debt will be amended and restated into a debt facility of A$30 million ($22.98 million) with a three-year term, it said. As part of the restructuring, Andrew Grech will step down from his position as group managing director, effective immediately. Additionally, all current directors will resign in due course with new directors appointed by the new lending group, the company said. The recapitalisation deal is subject to approval by shareholders and lenders and is expected to be completed in Oct. 2017, it said. Shares of the company were down 3.3 percent on Thursday afternoon after falling as much as 5.4 percent earlier in the day to touch a seven-week low. Slater and Gordon's market value has plunged to about A$30 million currently, from about A$2.76 billion in April 2015 following its ill-fated acquisition of the professional services division of British technology and outsourcing company Quindell. It has been facing a number of lawsuits over its financial statements in recent years.

Francois-Philippe Champagne is in Cincinnati for a meeting-packed June day as part of a concerted Canadian outreach campaign ahead of talks to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement. U.S. President Donald Trump describes the 1994 pact as a disaster and has threatened to walk away from it.        Concerned that any moves to abandon NAFTA or curb trade could cost thousands of jobs, the Liberal government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau wants to remind Americans how important bilateral trade is while seeking allies to press the Canadian cause if threats emerge. Since Trump's inauguration, Canadian politicians and officials have made almost 160 trips, meeting 14 cabinet members, almost 200 lawmakers and more than 40 state governors and lieutenant governors. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2tpGUdU) Mexico, the pact's third partner, has been leading a similar campaign.  We have to hammer, hammer, hammer away at this and when we're exhausted, hammer again,  said one person involved in the Canadian effort. Champagne's message is simple:  We are your largest client.  Every day some 400,000 people and C$2.4 billion ($1.82 billion) worth of trade cross the border. Crimping that flow will hurt both nations, says Ottawa. In all of Ohio, more than 300,000 jobs depend on trade with Canada, Champagne notes. To help drive home the point, Canadian officials drill deep into the data. For example, their analysis shows that in Ohio's first congressional district, 17,269 jobs depended on Canada-U.S. trade and investment, with exports exceeding $1 billion. Champagne, who flew in late the night before, starts his day at Cincinnati's members-only Queen City Club, where he hosts a breakfast with a dozen local leaders.  Sometimes as friends and neighbors we take each other for granted,  he tells the group.  Let's make sure we don't put things in place that would disrupt supply chains.  Reuters was granted exclusive access to the meetings during Champagne's trip.  Lawyer Daniel Ujczo, who specializes in Canada-U.S. affairs, tells Champagne his clients' biggest complaint is red tape that makes it hard to transfer specialists across the border.  I don't think companies will see a NAFTA win unless we address this,  he adds. Learning the Numbers Shortly afterwards Champagne tells a business forum of around 150 people that the greater Cincinnati area sends 20 percent of its exports to Canada. Diplomats hand out leaflets underlining the closeness of trade ties. In the car heading for his next appointment, Champagne reflects on the audience and tells aides:  They don't know many of the numbers.   That feeling is only underlined at a lunch with local politicians. William Seitz, a Republican member of Ohio's House of Representatives, admits afterwards his constituents know little about free trade. Canadian Trade Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne (R) shakes hands with Cincinnati vice mayor David Mann after a meeting in Cincinnati, Ohio, U.S., June 16, 2017. Picture taken June 16, 2017.David Ljunggren Folks don't understand as well as they should that when we erect barriers to trade with foreign countries, we are increasing prices for domestic consumers,  he says. Champagne is willing to use any hook to make a connection. He  studied in Cleveland and in every meeting notes a local politician once called him  a son of Ohio . Later in the day he presents an honorary certificate to Joey Votto, the Canadian star of the Cincinnati Reds baseball team.  You're our best export,  Champagne says as cameras click. As his car speeds from the Reds stadium to another appointment in the late afternoon, he says:  It's been a great day ... We've made a small difference.  Officials track the number of trips and how many people they meet, but say ultimately what counts is whether their new-found allies will step up to defend trade with Canada. Slideshow (3 Images)When Trump announced in April he might tear up NAFTA,  you had many Republican senators calling the White House and calling Trump to say 'This is crazy',  said another person involved in the campaign.  Some of the callers had already been approached by Canada as part of the effort to contact influence-makers, that person said. The outreach effort is not intended to convey a threat, says David MacNaughton, Canada's ambassador to Washington. But he adds:  It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that at some point, if they keep doing things that harm Canadian companies, that it's going to be difficult for us to resist doing the same.   Canada initially chose to focus on 11 states, selected for their economic and political importance. These include Indiana, home of Vice President Mike Pence. The Canadians are  talking to people who talk to Pence , one official tells Champagne. A few days after the trip, Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale is in Minneapolis, Minnesota, at an exclusive reception to build awareness of bilateral ties.  When the relationship is without any great problems, people tend to go to sleep on both sides,  he tells Reuters. Attendees include Neel Kashkari, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, and Joc O'Rourke, chief executive officer of phosphate giant Mosaic Co. Asked about the Canadian message, O'Rourke says most companies want freer or fairer trade. Pressed as to whether they will stand up for Canada, he replies:  They will of course stand up for what is in their best interest.  Goodale acknowledges the outreach does not guarantee success, but adds:  our trade will do better, and our relationship will do better, the more vigorous and outgoing we are . Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland quipped last month that  if you're an American official or legislator, it's been hard to avoid a Canadian , but Goodale is not worried Canada might be wearing out its welcome.  They are so big I think it will be a long time before we have overdone it,  he says.

Moon, making his first trip to the United States since becoming his country's leader, will join Trump and his wife, Melania, for dinner in the White House State Dining Room Thursday night ahead of meetings on Friday that are expected to touch on North Korea's nuclear program, China's role in the region and the U.S. military's THAAD missile defense system. Both men have an interest in building a strong relationship. Moon wants to form a friendship with the former New York businessman and find common ground on ways to resolve the crisis over North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs. Trump wants to build ties with an important leader in the region as he grows frustrated with Beijing's failure to rein in Pyongyang, despite his relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping.  If President Trump and I make strong personal ties of friendship and trust and if we were to try to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue on the basis of these personal ties, then I believe we will be able to achieve the resolution of the North Korean nuclear issue,” Moon told Reuters last week. Trade could affect that relationship-building process. In an interview with Reuters in April, Trump called the five-year-old KORUS trade pact between the United States and South Korea  horrible  and  unacceptable  and said he would either renegotiate or terminate it.  I think they’ll have a friendly and frank discussion about the trade relationship,  a White House official told reporters on Wednesday, noting concerns about barriers to U.S. auto sales and surplus Chinese steel that arrives in the United States via South Korea. The U.S. goods trade deficit with South Korea has more than doubled since KORUS took effect in 2012, from $13.2 billion in 2011 to $27.7 billion in 2016. It was forecast to boost U.S. exports by $10 billion a year, but they were $3 billion lower in 2016 than in 2011. During remarks at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce on Wednesday, Moon said unfair trade practices would be eradicated and factors that limited competition, such as market entry barriers and price regulations, would be  reevaluated  under his administration. Another potential sticking point in their talks could revolve around the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system that the United States deployed in South Korea in March. Moon, who has advocated a more moderate approach toward Pyongyang, expressed shock late last month upon learning that four more launchers for the controversial system had been brought into the country. He ordered a probe after his Defense Ministry failed to inform him of the move. The system, whose installation irritated China, is meant to counter the threat from North Korea's missile program. The White House said it did not expect THAAD to be a major point of conversation. Despite potential areas of disagreement, the two leaders are expected to express common resolve over threats from North Korea.  The similarities in our approaches are already evident,  the White House official said, noting that both men had expressed willingness to engage with Pyongyang under the right conditions.  Even once the conditions may present themselves, to enter into dialogue we must maintain and actually increase pressure on North Korea. That’s President Moon’s approach; it’s President Trump’s approach.

Fitch has also affirmed the Long-Term Foreign-Currency IDRs on Genting's 52.8%-owned subsidiary, Genting Singapore PLC (GENS), and Genting's wholly owned subsidiary, Genting Overseas Holdings Limited (GOHL), at 'A-'. The Outlooks for Genting, GENS and GOHL are Stable. A complete list of rating actions is at the end of this commentary. Genting's ratings reflect its monopoly position in gaming in Malaysia and robust market share of around 35% in the duopolistic Singapore market. Its leisure and hospitality (L&H;) business in these countries together accounts for over 80% of consolidated EBITDA. The gaming industry in both these countries is subject to close regulatory oversight, and the resultant barriers to entry impart a degree of stability to Genting's cash flows across the business cycle. It also enjoys some diversification benefits from L&H; assets in the UK, the US and the Bahamas as well as businesses such as oil-palm plantations, power, property and oil and gas. In addition to a robust operating profile, Genting has a relatively conservative capital structure. KEY RATING DRIVERS Margins Rebound at GENS: GENS, which contributed around 40% of Genting's consolidated 2016 EBITDA, saw improved margins in 2016, which helped to significantly offset the impact of weaker revenue. While GENS' revenue fell 7% in 2016 as the Asia-Pacific gaming market remained challenging, operating EBITDA margin (excluding a one-off tax refund benefit in 2015) improved due to tighter credit policies, leading to lower impairment of receivables, and a remodelled commission structure, in addition to an overall cost management focus. GENS' sustained focus has resulted in margins improving further in 1Q17. A sustained increase in visitor arrivals in Singapore (1Q17: 4% yoy growth, 2016: 8%) also bodes well for GENS as it focuses on growing its regional premium mass business and reinvests in its facilities. In addition to weak market conditions over the last few years, GENS has been impacted by the loss of market share to sole rival Marina Bay Sands Pte. Ltd. (MBS, BBB-/Stable) due to MBS' locational advantage given its proximity to Singapore's central business district. While risk from further market share loss to MBS remains, we expect GENS' revenue to be supported by higher visitor arrivals and signs of bottoming out in the overall regional gaming market. We believe the competitive landscape in Singapore is unlikely to change in the near term as additional licenses are improbable when the moratorium on such licenses expire in 2017 given the government's concerns over problem gambling. Additionally, while we believe that GENS, and the market in the region generally, is closing in on a recovery, returns on investment in a new casino in Singapore could be inadequate due to increased regional competition. Robust Outlook for Other Businesses: We expect earnings to grow at the Malaysian L&H; and oil-palm plantation businesses, which together contributed around 50% of Genting's consolidated EBITDA in 2016. Resorts World Genting (RWG) has opened several new facilities as part of its 10-year, MYR10 billion redevelopment masterplan launched in 2013, and other key attractions such as a new theme park and the remaining floors of its new mall and casino are scheduled to open progressively from 2017. We expect these developments to result in a sustained increase in visitor arrivals over the next three years, from 20 million in 2016, and drive revenue growth for Genting's L&H; business. The plantation business should benefit from a rebound in the yield on fresh fruit bunches (FFB) in 2017 due to improved weather conditions. Over the longer term, earnings should be supported by a sustained improvement in yields as its Indonesian oil-palm acreage matures as well as healthy palm-oil prices, in our view. Capex Likely to Increase: We estimate Genting's consolidated capex will increase over the next three years and average about twice of the MYR4.5 billion spent in 2016. Genting is investing in the Resorts World Las Vegas (RWLV) project and expects full-scale construction to commence from 3Q17 with an opening targeted for 2020. That is in addition to its further investment in RWG as part of its redevelopment plan, for which around MYR4 billion has been spent up to 2016. Our capex estimates do not factor in potential investment by GENS in Japan, given significant uncertainties. Capital Structure to Remain Conservative: Genting was in a net cash position as of end-2016, which we estimate will turn into a net debt position in the next three years due to higher capex. However, we estimate that leverage will still be relatively low with the ratio of net adjusted debt to operating EBITDAR less net income attributable to minorities at around 0.6x by 2019. The group's management has a track record of prudent capital management, recently evidenced by GENS' sale of its stake in a South Korean venture to bolster its cash reserves. Our estimates factor in likely equity inflows from the exercise of Genting's warrants, which expire in December 2018, as the exercise price is substantially lower than the current price. Rating Equalisation: The ratings of GENS and GOHL are equalised with that of the parent, Genting, due to strong operational and strategic ties, in line with Fitch's Parent and Subsidiary Rating Linkage criteria. Genting holds 52.8% of GENS through its 100% shareholding in GOHL. Fitch assesses GENS' standalone rating at 'BBB', despite its healthy operating profile and net cash position, due primarily to concentration risk given its single property in Singapore. DERIVATION SUMMARY Genting's ratings can be compared with that of Las Vegas Sands Corp (LVS, BBB-/Stable) and Crown Resorts Limited (Crown, BBB/Stable). While LVS is significantly larger than Genting in terms of both revenue and EBITDA with well-performing assets spread across the US, Macau and Singapore, it is still completely exposed to the L&H; business and has a substantially higher leverage than Genting. Crown is smaller than Genting and revenue is concentrated as all its properties are in Australia. Similar to LVS, Crown operates only in the L&H; sector and has higher leverage than Genting. These factors justify a higher rating for Genting than LVS and Crown. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: - Consolidated revenue growth for Genting of around 7% each year over 2017-19 (2016: 2%) - Operating EBITDA margin of 35%-36% over 2017-19 (2016: 32%) - Annual capex of around MYR8 billion on average over 2017-19. - Dividend pay-outs, including to minority interests, of around MYR1.6 billion on average over 2017-19. - Equity infusion of around MYR6 billion over 2017-18 through exercise of warrants. RATING SENSITIVITIES Genting Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action include: - Net financial leverage (as measured by the ratio of net adjusted debt to operating EBITDAR less net income attributable to minorities) being sustained at more than 1.0x. - Weakening of competitive position due to regulatory action in any of the markets in which Genting operates. Upside potential to the ratings is limited by the discretionary nature of gaming expenditure incurred by gaming patrons and the cyclicality and capital intensity of the gaming business. GENS Any weakening of operational and strategic ties between GENS and Genting will result in GENS' rating being notched down from its parent's rating. If there is a downgrade of Genting's rating, GENS' rating will be downgraded accordingly. GOHL Any weakening of operational and strategic ties between GOHL and Genting will result in GOHL's rating being notched down from its parent's rating. If there is a downgrade of Genting's rating, GOHL's rating will be downgraded accordingly. LIQUIDITY Very Comfortable Liquidity: Genting was in a net cash position as of 31 March 2017, with reported cash and cash equivalents of around MYR34 billion compared with debt, including GENS' perpetual capital securities, of around MYR32 billion. Of the total debt, around MYR10 billion is due within 12 months, including the perpetual capital securities which are scheduled to be redeemed in September-October 2017. GENS was also in a net cash position as of 31 March 2017, with reported cash and cash equivalents of SGD5.6 billion and debt, including perpetual capital securities, of SGD3.4 billion.

While China's Unipec, a unit of state refiner Sinopec , vies with Europe's Vitol to be the top global crude trader, Asian might in physical markets has not spilled over into international futures trading. Exchange data shows crude futures trading in Asia is stagnant, while volumes in Europe and North America have soared to records several times over the past year. The data also shows the biggest price movements occur outside of Asian office hours. That's a problem for producers, refiners and oil traders in Asia, and the desire for greater influence could spur China's ambitions to launch a long-delayed and troubled crude futures contract that would better reflect regional market conditions.  It's a risk to commit to selling or buying during Asian hours, because you never know what moves follow in night trading hours,  said Kaname Gokon, strategist for commodities brokerage Okato Shoji in Japan. Trading data shows that activity in Brent crude oil futures during the Asian day rarely tops 2,000 lots of 1,000 barrels per hour. That compares with 30,000 to 50,000 lots an hour during typical European or North American hours. Park Young-hoon, a refinery analyst at Hanwha Investment & Securities in South Korea said Asian  refiners have no options to respond  to the might of Europe and the United States. It is not just a question of which region dominates. Much of the shift is the result of behavioural changes in the markets. Canadian investment bank RBC Capital said this week that  tourist traders  were increasingly dominating oil markets rather than real oil market conditions.  Oil market intelligence has been diluted over recent years given the rise of algorithmically charged participants, from what historically was a physically driven market,  RBC said. Due to technology and big data this change is seen as unavoidable.  The whims of financial traders halfway across the globe make it hard for us to plan hedging strategies that are in tune with our refinery output,  said a trader with a large Asian refiner, speaking on the condition of anonymity as he was not allowed to disclose financial information. Though it's true that U.S. and European refiners and producers can also be impacted by speculators, many western oil majors such as Royal Dutch Shell, Chevron and BP are known to have large financial trading desks that help them to counter and make money from big market moves. China Rises Overall trading in Brent futures has soared, from under 1 million lots typically exchanged per month before 2005 to a record 7.3 million exchanged in May. Asia has so far played only a marginal role in the rise in crude futures trading. That may eventually change, though, as China steps up efforts this year to launch its much-awaited Shanghai crude futures contract.  China wants a seat at the global energy futures table, and is actively encouraging commodity trading and investment,  said John Driscoll, director of JTD Energy Services in Singapore. The project's details have been criticised - including for its denomination in yuan and the expected dominance of Chinese companies - yet few doubt that China's size and its culture of widespread retail trading mean a high-volume Chinese oil futures benchmark will eventually emerge. Shanghai's crude futures, currently planned for launch later this year, will likely see China's state-owned energy companies like Sinopec and PetroChina acting as market makers, giving them strength in financial trading similar to what they have long held in physical markets. It has already happened in commodities such as iron ore, coal and steel, where Chinese futures contracts have become global benchmarks after being widely dismissed by U.S. and European traders initially.  (Crude) futures in China … are part of a longer term strategy to develop the domestic market and develop an Asian benchmark,  said Michal Meidan, lead analyst for Asian energy policies at Energy Aspects.

Former education minister Hakubun Shimomura, who heads the Tokyo chapter of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), made the comments at a hastily called news conference just days before Sunday's election for the Tokyo Metropolitan assembly. The July 2 vote in the nation's capital is on the surface a referendum on Governor Yuriko Koike's first year in office, but it is also shaping up as a chance for voters in the capital to express their views on Abe's administration. Abe's support slumped in surveys released last week on voter concerns about suspicions that he helped a friend get permission to open a veterinary school in a special economic zone and criticism his ruling bloc rammed a contentious bill through parliament and ended the session to close off debate. Abe and his aides have repeatedly denied any wrongdoing in the approval process for the new school to be run by Kake Gakuen (Kake Educational Institution). Shimomura said an article in the weekly magazine Shukan Bunshun that his political support group had received 2 million yen ($17,812.61) in unreported donations from Kake Gakuen (Kake Educational Institution) was  completely false  and that the timing of the article was an attempt to affect the Tokyo poll.  I have never received political donations from Kake Gakuen nor did it buy (fund-raising) party tickets,  Shimomura said.  The fact that an article which is completely false has been written at this critical time must be considered as intended to interfere in the election,  Shimomura said, adding he was consulting lawyers about legal action. Koike is aiming for her new  Tokyo Residents First  party and its allies to win a majority in the 127-seat assembly, while the LDP hopes to keep its status as the biggest party. Abe's government suffered embarrassment this week when Defense Minister Tomomi Inada sought voter support in the Tokyo race saying the request was  from the defense ministry, the Self-Defense Forces, the defense minister and the LDP.   By law, the SDF, as Japan's military is known, must be politically neutral. Inada withdrew the remarks and Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga rebuffed opposition calls for her resignation.

The rise in rates is itself a response to strengthening economic activity. But vigilance is still called for. Economies and markets ... could be thrown off balance if rates rose faster than expected,  Ravi Menon, managing director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) told reporters. Rising interest rates in the United States have been a major focus for financial markets this year, especially with wobbles in China's economy raising worries that global growth could falter if the Federal Reserve tightens policy too fast. Besides the Fed, other advanced economies have also begun to switch gears. Bank of England Governor Mark Carney surprised many on Wednesday by conceding a hike was likely to be needed as the economy came closer to running at full capacity. The Bank of Canada went further, with two top policymakers suggesting they might tighten as early as July. Speaking after the release of the MAS's annual report, Menon said the current neutral stance of monetary policy - in place since April last year - remains appropriate for an extended period given the stable inflation and growth prospects. He reiterated that Singapore's export-reliant economy was forecast to grow by 1-3 percent this year, with a  strong likelihood  that growth would exceed last year's 2 percent. But Menon warned that authorities would not ease property market cooling measures, as the market showed some signs of recovery in recent months with strong growth in new home transactions and strong demand for the government's land auctions.  The property market has substantially stabilised over the last three years. It is, however, not time yet to ease the cooling measures,  Menon said.  Regional property markets have been buoyant and their respective authorities have... introduced further property cooling measures. Easing the measures now will send a wrong signal.

As the global economy stabilises, major countries need to normalise their interest rates, although this is happening at a very slow pace, Zhu told reporters in Beijing on Thursday.  We need to closely monitor how the normalisation of interest rates in major economies will impact global capital markets,  said Zhu.  The U.S. Federal Reserve has raised interest rates four times as part of a normalization of monetary policy that began in December 2015. The central bank had pushed rates to near zero in response to the financial crisis a decade ago. Zhu said the new global macroeconomic environment makes it even more important for global coordination through channels like the G20, which will convene in Hamburg next month.  Earlier this week, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), an umbrella body for leading central banks, said in one of its most upbeat annual reports for years that major central banks should press ahead with interest rate increases. Policymakers should take advantage of the improving economic outlook and its surprisingly negligible effect on inflation to accelerate the  great unwinding  of quantitative easing programmes and record low interest rates, the BIS said. The Chinese central bank guided market interest rates higher in the first quarter, including immediately after a Fed rate hike in March. The move was partly an effort to counter pressure on the yuan from capital outflows, analysts say. The People's Bank of China last adjusted its policy rates in October 2015. Efforts to rein in North Korea's nuclear and missile programmes are likely to be a focus in bilateral meetings President Xi Jinping might hold during the G20. Asked if Xi would meet U.S. President Donald Trump, South Korean President Moon Jae-in, or Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at the summit, Vice Foreign Minister Li Baodong said schedules were still being arranged. Li reiterated that China wants to resolve the situation on the Korean peninsula through dialogue. Trump is growing increasingly frustrated with China over its inaction on North Korea, according to senior U.S. administration officials, though Beijing has repeatedly said its influence over Pyongyang is limited and that it is doing all it can.

Earlier this week, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), an umbrella body for leading central banks, said in one of its most upbeat annual reports for years that major central banks should press ahead with interest rate increases. Policymakers should take advantage of the improving economic outlook and its surprisingly negligible effect on inflation to accelerate the  great unwinding  of quantitative easing programmes and record low interest rates, the BIS said. The Chinese central bank guided market interest rates higher in the first quarter, including immediately after a Fed rate hike in March. The move was partly an effort to counter pressure on the yuan from capital outflows, analysts say. The People's Bank of China last adjusted its policy rates in October 2015. Efforts to rein in North Korea's nuclear and missile programmes are likely to be a focus in bilateral meetings President Xi Jinping might hold during the G20. Asked if Xi would meet U.S. President Donald Trump, South Korean President Moon Jae-in, or Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at the summit, Vice Foreign Minister Li Baodong said schedules were still being arranged. Li reiterated that China wants to resolve the situation on the Korean peninsula through dialogue. Trump is growing increasingly frustrated with China over its inaction on North Korea, according to senior U.S. administration officials, though Beijing has repeatedly said its influence over Pyongyang is limited and that it is doing all it can.
