For large businesses with 100 or more employees, the higher wage will be phased in over five years, starting with an increase to $10 an hour from the current state minimum of $9.50 on Jan. 1, 2018. The higher wage will be phased in for smaller businesses over seven years. The $15 minimum wage will be fully implemented citywide by July 2024.Council member       Blong Yang       cast the lone dissenting vote. Mr. Yang said he was worried the ordinance might hurt his constituents in north Minneapolis, including small-business owners and entrepreneurs who are minorities and young workers.Minneapolis Mayor       Betsy Hodges       signed the ordinance shortly after its passage, her spokesman, Eric Fought, said.Supporters argued the higher wage would benefit low-income workers and minorities. According to a city news release, more than 84,000 people in Minneapolis have incomes below the federal poverty level. Increasing the minimum wage to $15 would benefit 23% of workers in Minneapolis, about 71,000 people.Critics contended the ordinance may chase budget-conscious customers out of the city and force small businesses to cut staff or reduce hours to make up for the higher wages.Council member       Jacob Frey,        a candidate for mayor this fall, amended the ordinance to clarify that certain franchisers such as fast-food restaurants will qualify as big businesses, even though a particular store may have fewer than 100 workers.The ordinance doesn\u2019t include an exception for tipped workers. Some wanted tips to be counted toward the $15 minimum wage, so restaurant owners could increase pay for kitchen staff without making drastic staffing changes.Minneapolis joins Seattle, San Francisco and Washington, D.C., among other cities that have approved similar measures in recent years. Council members said Friday they expect the ordinance will be challenged.St. Louis, Mo., raised its minimum wage to $10 an hour from the state level of $7.70 in early May, but the state legislature passed a bill repealing the increase. Gov. Eric Greitens said he will let the bill become law without his signature, which means the wage increase will end on Aug. 28, when new Missouri laws take effect.\u2014Copyright 2017 the Associated Press", "news_time": "2017-06-30 21:35:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/minneapolis-raises-minimum-wage-to-15-an-hour-1498860696", "news_title": "Minneapolis Raises Minimum Wage to $15 an Hour", "keywords": "low income,minimum wage,minneapolis,small business,wage hike,Betsy Hodges,labor,personnel,corporate,industrial news,entrepreneurs,small,medium businesses,workers pay,political,general news,general labor issues,politics,international relations,domestic politics,regional politics"}, {"content": "S\u00c3O PAULO\u2014The billionaire Odebrecht family that owns Latin America\u2019s largest construction group plans to relinquish its grip over the board and turn all of the firm\u2019s businesses public, as the company battles to emerge from one of the largest corruption scandals in history.Odebrecht SA\u2019s new Chief Executive Luciano Nitrini Guidolin, in his first interview since taking over in May, said Friday that the company plans to get most of its units listed within three years, and all of them public soon after.Odebrecht will likely begin by floating the agribusiness unit and its flagship construction business, Mr. Guidolin said. Meanwhile, the company aims to complete $3.6 billion of asset sales next year, he said.For decades, Odebrecht was considered the gold standard of Brazilian business and a source of national pride. Even as Brazil was ridiculed for its shoddy infrastructure, Odebrecht was building world-class airports, highways and hydroelectric plants in the U.S., Europe and Africa, as well as across Latin America. Known in the U.S. for building the Miami Heat\u2019s arena and part of Miami International Airport, Odebrecht saw its gross revenue reach $40 billion at the end of 2015, dwarfing many American construction groups.But in December last year, the family-owned company pleaded guilty to taking part in Brazil\u2019s vast Car Wash corruption scheme, which began as a money-laundering probe named after a gas station and has drawn in some of the country\u2019s major industries.Odebrecht admitted to paying almost $800 million in bribes to governments across the world for scores of contracts, signing what was at the time the biggest anticorruption settlement in history, agreeing to pay U.S., Brazilian and Swiss authorities at least $2.6 billion. According to prosecutors, corruption had become so integral to the company\u2019s business model that Odebrecht even had its own \u201cbribery department.\u201dMr. Guidolin said corruption wasn\u2019t spread throughout the group and it has taken all the measures to ensure such practices would never happen again.Marcelo Odebrecht,        the former chief executive and heir to the family empire, is now in prison in connection with the case, and Odebrecht\u2019s bonds plummeted recently as investors feared the 73-year-old group could struggle to pay its debts. As well as facing possible further fines around the world, Odebrecht has suffered a credit squeeze after Brazil\u2019s state development bank cut off its access to subsidized finance. Concerns also have grown about Odebrecht\u2019s ability to win new projects.After the company\u2019s spectacular fall from grace, the Odebrecht family, which arrived in Brazil from Germany in the mid-nineteenth century, now realizes it is time to loosen its grip over the conglomerate in a bid to reassure investors, according to the group.\u201cCar Wash was not the end and it will not be the end of Odebrecht,\u201d Mr. Guidolin said. \u201cWe will grow, from a smaller base than the one we had but a more solid one.\u201dEm\u00edlio Odebrecht, the family patriarch and chairman, is expected to step down from the board at the end of next year, the company said. And his son Marcelo, who was arrested in June 2015 and convicted as part of the Car Wash probe, won\u2019t return to the company\u2019s helm.The company said members of the founding Odebrecht family would no longer occupy top executive roles at the company but would remain as shareholders. In some of the businesses, the family would consider selling off controlling stakes to outside investors. Mr. Guidolin said outside investors could buy stakes in some of the businesses before they are listed. Odebrecht has even discussed changing the name of its holding company, a possible measure to revamp its image, the company said. The hope is that bringing in outsider investors would increase transparency as well as fresh capital, Mr. Guidolin said.One of Odebrecht\u2019s first priorities is to free up liquidity after the company\u2019s revenue slumped in the wake of its chief executive\u2019s arrest, the company said. In the 12 months before December 2016, the company\u2019s revenue is estimated to have dropped about 30% to $27.1 billion from $40 billion, according to people close to the company.Odebrecht said it has fired tens of thousands of workers since 2013, and it has shrunk to 10 businesses from 15 over roughly the past year. But Mr. Guidolin said the group wasn\u2019t considering selling what it considers to be one of its crown jewels\u2014its controlling stake in petrochemical company Braskem, which is already publicly traded.If Odebrecht\u2019s rescue plan works\u2014and observers say that is a big if\u2014the strategy could serve as a blueprint for the scores of companies implicated in Car Wash that are now struggling to attract investors and clients.The three-year investigation has called into question the very way of doing business in Brazil, laying bare a corporate world dominated by family-owned fiefs that rely on favors from friendly government officials just to function.S\u00e9rgio Moro, the judge leading the Car Wash investigation, said in an interview this month that the probe has prompted companies to clean up their act.\u201cVarious businessmen realized that corruption is a risky game, not only when it comes to their freedom, but also the reputation of their companies,\u201d he said.As part of Odebrecht\u2019s settlement, two independent compliance monitors have been working from the 16th floor of Odebrecht\u2019s S\u00e3o Paulo office since March. Compliance policies have been overhauled and employees are required to wear the company\u2019s 10 anticorruption commandments on plastic badges around their neck at all times. \u201cCombat corruption\u201d is No. 1.Yet some wish Odebrecht was doing more. Odebrecht\u2019s decision to appoint Mr. Guidolin, a company veteran who was most recently vice president of investments, was a missed opportunity to appoint a true outsider, said Daniel Vargas, a law professor at Getulio Vargas Foundation in Rio de Janeiro.Mr. Guidolin himself said he saw his role as being a bridge between the old and the new Odebrecht, adding it would have been a mistake to bring in someone new. They wouldn\u2019t have \u201cknown where the problems are,\u201d he said.Legal experts say Odebrecht may struggle to move on while foreign governments are still carrying out follow-on investigations from its December plea deal. Vladimir Aras, a Brazilian prosecutor who leads the international cooperation unit of the attorney general\u2019s office, said he has received dozens of requests for information related to the Odebrecht case from 10 foreign governments, including the U.S.But one of the biggest obstacles to Odebrecht\u2019s recovery plan continues to be the Brazilian government. Some federal government officials believe the December settlement sold Brazil short and are pushing for heavier fines and sanctions, making potential buyers nervous, according to lawyers familiar with the company\u2019s asset sales. Brazil\u2019s state development bank BNDES is still refusing to finance international projects linked to Odebrecht and several other construction companies implicated in the graft scandal.In the northeastern city of Salvador, where the Odebrecht group was founded and where the company still has its official headquarters and museum, some locals are reluctant to forgive and forget.At Salvador\u2019s state university, Elane Gomes Lopes, a 19-year-old engineering student, said she considered giving up on the profession after the scandal broke. She spent her childhood building bridges out of Legos as her friends played with dolls, and always dreamed of working at Odebrecht.\u201cEveryone knew the company, everyone had a good impression of it,\u201d she said, adding that unless it made major changes she wouldn\u2019t work there.Write to Luciana Magalhaes at Luciana.Magalhaes@wsj.com and Samantha Pearson at samantha.pearson@wsj.comAppeared in the July 1, 2017, print edition as 'Brazil\u2019s Odebrechts Ease Grip on Firm.'", "news_time": "2017-06-30 20:33:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/brazils-odebrecht-plans-to-take-all-of-its-businesses-public-1498869196", "news_title": "Odebrecht Family Loosens Grip on Scandal-Plagued Construction Giant", "keywords": " brazilian builder,brazilian construction company, carwash scandal, publicly traded, spinoff,Odebrecht S/A,Em\u00edlio Odebrecht,Luciano Nitrini Guidolin,plans,strategy,corporate crime,legal action,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,corruption,crime,financial crime,diversified holding companies,business,consumer services"}, {"content": "Illinois officials took promising steps toward resolving a two-year standoff over a budget, but alerted rating firms that they will likely miss a deadline of midnight Friday that could trigger a downgrade to junk status.The state\u2019s House of Representatives voted Friday in support of a Democratic spending plan introduced by Rep.       Greg Harris,        one that is largely viewed as a compromise. But how to fund it is still being hashed out in the legislature.Mr. Harris is an ally of Democratic House Speaker       Michael Madigan,        whose stalemate with Republican Gov.       Bruce Rauner       over spending has left the state without a budget for two years, causing widespread economic stress at schools, hospitals and other entities that rely on state spending.\u201cToday is the make-or-break day,\u201d Mr. Harris said. \u201cNo one wants to hear any excuses. They\u2019ve heard it over and over. Today people want to see action.\u201dThe Democrats\u2019 $36.5 billion plan includes a 5% cut to government agencies. Lawmakers are still negotiating an accompanying revenue measure to balance the budget. Republicans and Democrats generally favor a $5 billion tax, increasing the state\u2019s personal income-tax rate from 3.75% to 4.95% and the corporate income-tax rate from 5.25% to 7%.Lawmakers remain deadlocked over passing a property tax freeze, which Mr. Rauner has been pushing.Republican Rep.       David Harris       was one of several GOP members who rallied his colleagues in support of the Democratic spending plan. \u201cI don\u2019t like everything that\u2019s in this plan,\u201d he said. \u201c[But] now is the time to bring this nightmare to an end.\u201dFollowing the vote, Mr. Madigan confirmed the House would convene again Saturday, the first day of the new fiscal year. He also said he was writing to rating firms urging them to postpone judgment on the state\u2019s bond rating until lawmakers and the governor broker a balanced budget.Illinois has a $14.6 billion backlog of unpaid bills, and             S&P Global Inc.       has threatened to downgrade the state\u2019s bond rating to junk status if lawmakers don\u2019t reach a deal by July 1.\u201cWhile we\u2019ve made significant progress toward solving the governor\u2019s budget crisis, more work remains,\u201d Mr. Madigan wrote to the rating firms. \u201cWe will continue working to put a compromise on the governor\u2019s desk and end this impasse through the next week, and I ask you to allow these negotiations to move forward.\u201dA spokesman for Moody\u2019s Investors Service confirmed the ratings firm had received Mr. Madigan\u2019s letter but said it had no comment. A spokeswoman for S&P said the firm doesn\u2019t comment on specific interactions with the governments it rates.Mr. Madigan also said he would meet Friday with Senate President       John Cullerton,        a Democrat, and both chambers\u2019 Republican minority leaders to hash out further negotiations.\u201cMuch work remains to be done,\u201d Mr. Madigan said following the vote on Mr. Harris\u2019s spending measure. \u201cLet\u2019s keep up the good work and get the job done.\u201dHouse members merely voted to adopt Mr. Harris\u2019 plan as an amendment to another bill, so it will need another vote of approval from the full chamber before heading to the Senate. Still, lawmakers from both sides of the aisle struck a largely self-congratulatory tone during deliberation on the measure.\u201cI come here today with joy because I know we\u2019re going to do the right thing,\u201d said Republican Rep.       Steven Andersson,        drawing a standing ovation from both sides of the chamber. \u201cWe are going to save our state, and we are going to save our state together.\u201d\u201cThis is not a perfect plan, but it\u2019s the best plan that was developed in a bipartisan way,\u201d said Democratic Rep.       Emanuel Chris Welch.       \u201cStand firm, Democrats. Stand firm, Republicans. You\u2019ve done great work.\u201dEarlier Friday morning, the governor reiterated his threat from Wednesday to extend the legislative session until the General Assembly produces a budget he can sign.\u201cThis is it. If lawmakers can\u2019t get a plan to my desk today, I\u2019ll have no choice but to keep them here in Springfield until the job is done,\u201d Mr. Rauner tweeted.Mr. Rauner\u2019s administration referred questions to House Minority Leader Jim Durkin. Mr. Durkin recruited Republicans to vote for the spending plan and said on the House floor that an end to the deadlock is in sight. \u201cI\u2019m telling you we are close,\u201d he said.Also on Friday, the state Senate\u2019s GOP caucus announced Sen.       Bill Brady       of Bloomington as their new leader. Mr. Brady, who was previously the assistant Republican leader and has launched three unsuccessful bids for governor, succeeds Rep.       Christine Radogno,        who announced her resignation Thursday.\u201cThe issues facing Illinois are daunting, but our caucus remains committed to working together to face those challenges,\u201d Mr. Brady said in a statement.In a Facebook video posted Wednesday evening, Democratic Illinois Comptroller       Susana Mendoza       sounded the alarm bells, warning of the dire consequences if a budget solution isn\u2019t reached by Friday.\u201cDerailment is imminent,\u201d she said. \u201cThere will be no money, not a penny available, for hardship cases such as social service agencies, domestic violence shelters, mental health facilities and senior and hospice care facilities.\u201dMs. Mendoza added that once \u201cunthinkable\u201d effects like delayed pension payments and missed payroll for employees are now a possibility.

The children were then placed with sponsors\u2014typically parents, close relatives or family friends\u2014who cared for the minors while their cases moved through the immigration court system.The government said it plans to arrest the sponsors.\u201cICE aims to disrupt and dismantle end-to-end the illicit pathways used by transnational criminal organizations and human-smuggling facilitators,\u201d agency spokeswoman       Sarah Rodriguez       said. \u201cThe sponsors who have placed children directly into harm\u2019s way by entrusting them to violent criminal organizations will be held accountable.\u201dImmigrant advocacy groups said they were investigating a dozen arrests that may involve sponsors, including the arrest of an unaccompanied child\u2019s brother in Texas, as well as other cases in New York, Pennsylvania and Virginia.\u201cArresting those who come forward to sponsor unaccompanied children during their immigration proceedings, often parents, is unimaginably cruel,\u201d said       Wendy Young,        president of Kids in Need of Defense, a nonprofit that has matched thousands of unaccompanied minors with attorneys in the last eight years. \u201cWithout caregivers to come forward, many of these children will languish in costly detention centers or be placed in foster care at great expense to states.\u201dChildren whose sponsors were arrested would be placed with another verified relative or guardian, or under the care of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, the federal agency that takes custody of unaccompanied minors, Ms. Rodriguez said.Officials didn\u2019t respond to questions Friday seeking details on the number of sponsors who would be targeted or already had been arrested, or what charges would be applied.Immigration enforcement was a centerpiece of Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential run, and he has sought to carry through on his campaign promises by cracking down on people in the country illegally. He has vowed to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border and go after \u201csanctuary cities\u201d that enact favorable policies toward immigrants, while emboldening ICE to arrest more people.Since October 2013, nearly 170,000 unaccompanied minors have been placed with sponsors in all 50 states and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and many are still awaiting their day in court, according to federal data.\u2014Copyright 2017 the Associated Press", "news_time": "2017-06-30 20:10:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-to-arrest-parents-sponsors-who-hire-smugglers-to-bring-children-across-border-1498867812", "news_title": "U.S. to Arrest Parents, Sponsors Who Hire Smugglers to Bring Children Across Border", "keywords": "enforcement,human trafficking,illegal immigration,immigration,smuggling,undocumented,Immigration and Customs Enforcement,political,general news,crime,legal action,migration,politics,international relations,domestic politics,trafficking"}, {"content": "Microsoft Corp.        MSFT 0.76%       will reorganize its global sales group next week, laying off workers, as it refines the business to focus on selling its cloud-computing services, according to a person familiar with the plans.The exact number of layoffs is unclear, though they will hit staff in offices around the world, this person said.\u00a0Microsoft more than 121,000 employees at the end of March, the last time the company disclosed its head count.Reorganizations at the software giant are something of an annual ritual, often announced at the close of the company\u2019s fiscal year, which ends\u00a0Friday.A year ago, Microsoft revamped its sales organization after       Kevin Turner,        the company\u2019s chief operating officer, who oversaw 51,000 employees, left the company.Microsoft Chief Executive       Satya Nadella       used Mr. Turner\u2019s departure to reorganize the sales group, promoting\u00a0      Judson Althoff       to executive vice president of its world-wide commercial business, and       Jean-Philippe Courtois       to executive vice president and head of global sales, marketing and operations.The reorganization next week will refine the sales duo\u2019s roles, as well as boost the sales group\u2019s focus on cloud-computing services, according to the person familiar with the plans.\u00a0The organization has historically focused on selling packaged software and services to corporate buyers.Microsoft has raced to build out its web-based, on-demand computing business to compete with cloud-infrastructure pioneer             Amazon.com Inc.

The initiative, quickly seized on by President Donald Trump, renewed an idea that earlier had been discarded as politically and practically unworkable, and some Republicans on Capitol Hill said the idea was unlikely to get sufficient support this time either.The repeal-first approach reopens an old skirmish between Republican centrists and conservatives, whose disagreements over everything from the scope and timeline of an ACA repeal to the future of Medicaid and the nature of health insurance have hamstrung the party.Now, lawmakers heading home for recess have another potential headache: the letters to consumers sent to comply with rules requiring insurers to give policyholders notice of at least 180 days, or about six months, before they pull out of a state\u2019s individual insurance market. That puts the deadline in early July for a plan that runs until the end of December.In many cases, planned withdrawals from certain ACA marketplaces by major insurers, including             Aetna Inc.,Humana Inc.       and             Anthem Inc.,       have been disclosed. But the letters may be the first affirmation for many consumers that their plans will end.Some insurers are also sending the letters even if they haven\u2019t made a final decision to withdraw, just to keep their options open, said       Nate Purpura,        a vice president at             eHealth Inc.,       an online insurance vendor. \u201cIf they ultimately need to leave, they have to send these,\u201d he said.The withdrawal notices are already causing heartburn, according to insurance agents and other industry officials. In Mississippi, one of the states where Humana will stop selling plans, consumers have recently been calling the state\u2019s insurance regulator in alarm after getting letters, said Mike Chaney, the insurance commissioner. \u201cThey\u2019re worried about what they will do for health insurance,\u201d he said.In Knoxville, Tenn., Reba Horn, 63 years old, opened a letter from Humana last week to discover her insurance wouldn\u2019t be sold next year. She was shocked. \u201cI had no idea\u201d Humana would leave the market, she said. Humana is the only current exchange insurer in the Knoxville area, but BlueCross BlueShield of Tennessee has said it would offer plans there next year.Ms. Horn, an assistant for attorneys, called and peppered her insurance broker with questions. \u201cWhere am I going to look? Is it going to cost me more? Am I going to have the same coverage?\u201d Her broker, Debra Foster, said she would likely not have answers until open enrollment in November.Senate leaders delayed a vote this past week on legislation unveiled the previous week, after a report from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found that GOP bill would result in 22 million more people uninsured in a decade, compared with current law.Republicans have said insurer exits from some markets and rate-increase proposals show the need for their legislation. Democrats say the insurers are reacting to uncertainty created by Republicans\u2014including questions about the future of federal payments that help with health costs for low-income enrollees, which the Trump administration has threatened to stop.The CBO report on the GOP Senate bill said its effect on consumers would vary. Some, particularly younger ones, could see lower premiums than they would under the ACA, partly because plans might be skinnier and cover fewer benefits. But for lower-income consumers or those with special needs, overall medical costs could be significantly higher.In announcing withdrawals, several insurers have highlighted questions about the cost-sharing payments and enforcement of the ACA\u2019s individual coverage mandate. Some have also pointed to business challenges in their marketplace plans.In the fall of 2013, the Obama administration faced a backlash when consumers got notices informing them that their policies would be canceled at the end of the year because they didn\u2019t meet new ACA requirements. Under pressure, the administration that November said it would let people keep their old plans for at least another year.Letters from insurers going out now feature strongly worded versions of the following language: \u201cUrgent: Your health coverage is at risk.\u201dThe letters are going to some consumers who get their coverage in the individual insurance market, which includes online exchanges created under the ACA.According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, about 22 million Americans, or 7% of the population, have individual plans. The figures are for 2015, the most recent year available. Most people in the U.S. have health insurance through an employer or a government program such as Medicare or Medicaid.Consumers\u2019 plans wouldn\u2019t end until Dec. 31. Typically, their next step would be to shop for coverage from a different insurer during fall\u2019s open-enrollment period. But Republican health legislation could change the rules.In an estimated 36 counties in Nevada, Ohio and Indiana, no insurer so far has signed up to offer exchange coverage. In those places, if no other company comes in, some consumers may not be able to access plans at all.In Iowa, insurance broker Lynn Schreder said her firm is getting calls from consumers who got letters from Aetna and Wellmark Blue Cross and Blue Shield. \u201cFor some of those who have an ongoing health situation, they\u2019re panicking,\u201d she said.\u201cPeople absolutely feel scared and concerned about their personal health situation and what this non-renewal could mean,\u201d said\u00a0      Michael Z.\u00a0Stahl,        a senior vice president at insurance agency\u00a0HealthMarkets Inc.Aetna said it has sent letters to consumers in states including Virginia, Delaware and Iowa. The insurer said the notices are going out to nearly all the households of its current individual-market enrollees. At the end of March, Aetna had about 255,000 consumers in its individual plans.Humana\u00a0said it \u201csent out 180-day notices to affected members.\u201d\u00a0In February, the insurer said it would exit its individual commercial business at the end of 2017. At that time, it said it had about 550,000 people in individual plans in 11 states including Tennessee, Kentucky and Mississippi.Anthem said it is sending letters to consumers in Ohio and Wisconsin.             Cigna Corp.       said it is sending withdrawal notices in Maryland,\u00a0California, Connecticut, Georgia, South Carolina and Texas.The 180-day letters must be sent only if an insurer is fully exiting a state\u2019s individual market, according to lawyers, though the details of how the rules are enforced vary by state.\u2014Louise Radnofsky contributed to this article.Write to Anna Wilde Mathews at anna.mathews@wsj.com and Melanie Evans at Melanie.Evans@wsj.comAppeared in the July 1, 2017, print edition as 'Warnings Raise Stakes on Health.'", "news_time": "2017-06-30 19:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/insurers-policy-warnings-raise-stakes-in-health-fight-1498865398", "news_title": "Insurers\u2019 Policy Warnings Raise Stakes in Health Fight", "keywords": "Aetna,AET,Anthem,ANTM,Cigna,CI,eHealth,EHTH,Humana,HUM,political,general news,society,community,health,politics,international relations,domestic politics,welfare,social services,insurance,non-life insurance,medical insurance,financial services"}, {"content": "The scandal swirling around a Malaysian state investment fund allegedly defrauded of billions of dollars has entangled the United Arab Emirates ambassador to the U.S., according to court and investigative documents reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.Companies connected\u00a0to       Yousef Al Otaiba,        the ambassador, received $66 million\u00a0from offshore companies that investigators in the U.S. and Singapore have said contained funds misappropriated from 1Malaysia Development Bhd, the documents show.There have been no public disclosures as to the purpose of the transfers, and Mr. Otaiba declined to comment on them.Separately, emails written by and to Mr. Otaiba, hacked by a dissident group and leaked to news organizations, include descriptions of meetings between       Shaher Awartani,        an Abu Dhabi-based business partner of Mr. Otaiba, and       Jho Low,        the Malaysian financier the Justice Department says was the central conspirator in the alleged $4.5 billion 1MDB fraud. Messrs. Otaiba and Low have been associates since the early 2000s and Mr. Low has described his friendship with Mr. Otaiba in interviews over the years.A spokeswoman for the U.A.E. embassy in Washington declined to address the evidence of financial transfers, but dismissed the leaked emails as part of a campaign against the U.A.E.\u201cThe Embassy notes the existence of numerous orchestrated dossiers that have been prepared in recent weeks targeting the Ambassador and which are purported to contain hacked emails,\u201d the spokeswoman said. \u201cWe also note the context of the role of the U.A.E. in the current suspension of diplomatic and economic relations with the State of Qatar. As a result we will not talk to or respond to any of these dossiers.\u201dThe U.A.E. and other Arab countries have cut diplomatic ties with Qatar, alleging it has financed extremists.A senior official in Abu Dhabi, the U.A.E.\u2019s capital, defended Mr. Otaiba\u2019s private business interests. He declined to address the transactions allegedly connected to 1MDB.\u201cAs is typical among many foreign diplomats, the ambassador has business interests outside of his official duties,\u201c he said. \u201dHis business interests began long before his diplomatic career.\u201dMr. Awartani, the ambassador\u2019s business partner, didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.The transfers connected to Mr. Otaiba are the latest chapter in the 1MDB saga, which grew from a Malaysian fund with debt problems in early 2015 into what investigators have described as one of the biggest frauds in history. The U.S. Justice Department has filed civil lawsuits seeking the forfeiture of approximately $1.7 billion of assets alleged to have been purchased with money misappropriated from 1MDB by a group of conspirators with Mr. Low at the center. Those assets include Mr. Low\u2019s stake in New York\u2019s Park Lane Hotel, rights to some profits from \u201cThe Wolf of Wall Street\u201d and other films, jewelry and a $250 million yacht.Authorities in the U.A.E., Luxembourg, Hong Kong, Singapore and Switzerland have also said they have been investigating allegations of fraud and money laundering connected to 1MDB. Singapore has found several bankers guilty of failing to follow money-laundering rules in connection with 1MDB.1MDB has denied any wrongdoing and said it has found no evidence any of its money was misappropriated. The fund has pledged to cooperate with any lawful investigation. Malaysia has closed all but one of its domestic investigations into 1MDB with no wrongdoing found.Mr. Low hasn\u2019t been accused of a crime and has denied wrongdoing.\u201cMr. Low is confident that when the appropriate and impartial legal tribunals are presented with the actual facts, it will be clear that this case is deeply flawed and an example of vast overreach by certain authorities,\u201d a representative for Mr. Low said on Friday. \u201cThis shows a reliance on improperly obtained and selectively leaked, unauthenticated information to support a politically motivated and unproven narrative. This creates a biased and inaccurate picture.\u201dA Singapore criminal case against a Swiss banker disclosed $50 million of payments made to the companies connected to Mr. Otaiba, including Densmore Investments Ltd. in the British Virgin Islands and Silver Coast Construction & Boring in the U.A.E. In laying out their case against the banker, Singapore prosecutors described the payments to the two companies as \u201cintended to be used in connection with an act which may constitute criminal conduct.\u201d The banker pleaded guilty to failing to report potentially criminal transactions involving those companies and to lying to authorities about them.The Singapore proceedings referred to the companies but didn\u2019t mention Mr. Otaiba. In separate documents reviewed by the Journal related to Singapore\u2019s investigation of alleged 1MDB-linked money laundering, authorities describe Densmore as controlled by Messrs. Otaiba and Awartani. Those documents also describe another $16 million of separate payments to Densmore in the form of loans from a company connected to the alleged fraud.Silver Coast Construction and Densmore were co-founded by Messrs. Otaiba and Awartani, according to people familiar with the matter. Representatives of the Silver Coast declined to comment. Densmore was shut down in January 2016.Mr. Otaiba\u2019s emails, obtained by a group calling itself Global Leaks, show several interactions between Messrs. Otaiba, Awartani and Low. A representative of the group, which uses an email address that ends with \u201c.ru\u201d denoting Russia, said its mission \u201cis to bring truth to people and society\u201d because of Gulf influence in American foreign policy.In one leaked email to Mr. Otaibi, Mr. Awartani describes a December 2013 meeting with Mr. Low in which Mr. Low said Mr. Awartani and Mr. Otaiba would be paid an undisclosed amount of cash before the end of the year if a deal for the Helmsley building in New York City closed that day.\u00a0In 2013, Mr. Low took a 55% stake in the 46-story building, also known as the Park Lane Hotel, and sold part of his stake to Abu Dhabi sovereign-wealth fund Mubadala Development.On May 5, 2015, a Dubai-based financial executive working at a company controlled by Messrs. Otaiba and Awartani told Mr. Otaiba in an email that Mr. Low had instructed the men to close their accounts at BSI Bank, a private Swiss bank that investigators in the U.S., Switzerland and Singapore say played an instrumental role in the alleged 1MDB fraud. Densmore held an account at BSI.\u201cHe has moved the major assets and accounts away from BSI, with some remaining which will be closed/transferred soon,\u201d the executive said of Mr. Low.The financial executive also wrote that Mr. Low discussed buying a bank in Barbados for Mr. Low to stow money, with a Dubai investment company controlled by Messrs. Otaiba and Awartani as the official buyer.Mr. Low \u201cfelt compelled to buy a bank as a parking spot for his funds, as well as friends & family,\u201d the executive wrote.Write to Bradley Hope at bradley.hope@wsj.com and Tom Wright at tom.wright@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-30 19:16:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-a-e-s-ambassador-to-u-s-linked-to-1mdb-scandal-1498864605", "news_title": "U.A.E.\u2019s Ambassador to U.S. Linked to 1MDB Scandal ", "keywords": "1Malaysia Development,Yousef Al Otaiba,Jho Low,corporate crime,legal action,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,crime,international relations,embezzlement,financial crime,fraud,politics,domestic politics,financial investments,financial services,investing,securities"}, {"content": "Xi Jinping       received a red-carpet welcome when he landed in Hong Kong for this weekend\u2019s 20th anniversary of the handover to Chinese rule. But the mainland\u2019s paramount leader will receive plenty of curses too as protesters follow him around the territory. The public anger is due to Beijing\u2019s failure to honor its promises of democracy and autonomy, which is radicalizing the city\u2019s youth and making it difficult for Beijing\u2019s appointed leaders to govern.On the surface at least, the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d formula devised by       Deng Xiaoping       to last 50 years has worked tolerably well. Much as when it was a British colony, Hong Kong\u2019s capitalist system generates enormous wealth, the judiciary is officially independent and civil liberties are protected.But look closer and Hong Kong\u2019s special status is slipping away. The central government\u2019s \u201cliaison office\u201d increasingly micromanages Hong Kong affairs. The National People\u2019s Congress has overruled key judicial decisions, and senior officials call on judges to rubber stamp executive-branch decisions. In early 2016, mainland enforcers kidnapped       Lee Bo       in Hong Kong and put him on trial in China after he published critics of Chinese leaders.Young people in particular are angry that mainland power is changing their city. In the \u201cumbrella movement\u201d protests of 2014, students occupied the business district for 75 days but failed to convince China to allow the election of the chief executive by universal suffrage. Beijing will continue to select the city\u2019s leader through a 1,200-member committee dominated by the pro-China business elite.It didn\u2019t have to be this way. The British could have begun a democratic process when they still ruled, as these columns advised after       Margaret Thatcher\u2019s       1984 deal with Beijing. If China had offered a roadmap to full democracy in the early 2000s, when Hong Kong people were quietly signaling their desire for more say in government, Beijing could have earned respect and loyalty. Instead, in 2003 then Chief Executive       Tung Chee-hwa       tried to pass antisubversion laws to curtail civil liberties.A million people turned out on the streets, kicking off a protest movement that has since waxed and waned. At each stage Beijing has responded with threats rather than compromise, adding to the rancor. The central government has created precisely the opposition it feared, as some young politicians call for independence from China.All of this is a reminder that one important underpinning of Hong Kong\u2019s freedom was never written down: the assumption that the reforming China of the 1980s would continue to free up its economy and start a process of political reform leading eventually to democracy. Some dared to hope that the city would help Beijing learn to accept elections without preordained results.Mr. Xi and predecessor       Hu Jintao       instead tightened political repression on the mainland. Chinese leaders see Hong Kong not as a democratic model but as an example to show they will deal sternly with \u201csplittists.\u201d Veiled threats suggest that Hong Kong\u2019s new Chief Executive,       Carrie Lam,        will be forced to reintroduce antisubversion laws. China\u2019s foreign ministry said Friday that the Sino-British Joint Declaration on Hong Kong is now merely an \u201chistoric document that no longer has any realistic meaning.\u201dThis is a tragedy for Hong Kong, the city that       Milton Friedman       hailed as a model of free-market prosperity, but it is also a tragedy for mainland citizens who have hoped that Chinese prosperity would lead to greater self-government. Beijing\u2019s attempts to intimidate dissent are making Hong Kong\u2019s rising generation more insistent that democracy is needed to guarantee their freedoms.

The GOP state Senate\u2019s only negotiating leverage was mayoral control. Mayor de Blasio wanted it renewed but he and       Carl Heastie,        Democratic speaker of the State Assembly, were adamant that it not be done in exchange for allowing more charters.They won. This week, after Gov.       Andrew Cuomo       called the legislature back into special session, Albany reached a compromise. It\u2019s not being called the \u201cbig ugly\u201d for nothing: It has something in it for every politician. Gov. Cuomo gets the new Tappan Zee Bridge named after his late father, Mario; Republicans gets some county sales tax extensions they wanted; fireman and cops get some pension sweeteners\u2014and Democrats get mayoral control for Mr. de Blasio while successfully resisting any opening to new charters.The losers are the non-politicians, especially the students who needed someone in Albany to fight for them to get a better chance for a better education. We\u2019re thinking of the 50,000 kids in New York City who are on a waiting list because there aren\u2019t enough charters to meet the demand.Republicans control only the state Senate, and Gov. Cuomo could have made the difference if he had stood up for charters. But Mr. Cuomo is planning to run for President in 2020 and needs to mollify the unions, while the Republican Party claims to be on the side of charters, choice and education reform.Everyone knows the Democratic Party long ago sold its soul to the unions.

So note that the Food and Drug Administration, under new political management, took initial steps this week to lower the cost of prescription medicine for patients. You might not have noticed amid the latest Trump             Twitter                   meltdown.Earlier this week FDA published a list of drugs that don\u2019t face competition from generic alternatives even though their intellectual property protections have expired. FDA said it will expedite the approval process for such applications \u201cuntil there are three approved generics for a given drug product.\u201d The agency says it will take more steps and has announced a July meeting for public feedback.For some drugs on the roster, no company has submitted a generic application. One reason is that the cost of developing a generic product can run into the millions of dollars, and many can\u2019t fetch the profit to recoup the expense. Yet competition is essential for lowering prices: Consumers pay 94% of the branded price on average when one generic firm enters the market, but that drops to 52% with two competitors and to 44% with three, according to an FDA analysis.The savings ripple across the health-care system, and last year generics saved $253 billion, according to a June report from the Association for Accessible Medicines. Case in point are alternatives for chronic troubles like the cholesterol-reducing statin, Lipitor, which cost $3.29 a unit before its patent expired. The generic version last year cost $0.11.One barrier to innovation is that some manufacturers are abusing FDA safety and risk mitigation regulations to protect monopoly positions. A generic competitor has to prove equivalence to the branded product to win FDA approval, and that requires extensive testing with anywhere from 1,500 to 5,000 tablets of the original treatment. But companies are invoking FDA safe-use and distribution restrictions to avoid handing over the capsules.In 2014, Alex Brill of Matrix Global Advisors analyzed reported cases of this misuse. Delayed competition for 40 products cost $5.4 billion annually in lost savings, Mr. Brill found. About $1.8 billion of the cost is picked up by the federal government through Medicaid and other programs. This issue will no doubt capture attention at the agency\u2019s public meeting next month, and Congress could help by codifying changes as part of an agency reauthorization. Bills to rein in this behavior have been introduced.A larger challenge for FDA is developing an approval process for \u201ccomplex generics,\u201d like the allergy shot EpiPen, that require a device or present some other complication. The good news is that no scholar has devoted as much attention to the issue as new FDA Commissioner       Scott Gottlieb,        who has testified to Congress that the generic approval process was written when most products were molecule pills that were straightforward to recreate. Regarding EpiPen, FDA regulations helped keep a generic alternative off the market by requiring an identical device to deliver a shot of adrenaline.This week\u2019s announcement is the beginning of a process, and other unresolved issues include that most generics are not approved on the first round, and revisions create substantial work for companies and FDA staff. The agency also has a backlog of applications and has struggled to hire enough staff to keep up with applications.None of this will ever attract the media attention of \u201cPharma bro\u201d       Martin Shkreli,        who jacked up the price of a treatment that faced no competition, or the periodic mugging of some drug company CEO in front of Congress. But Dr. Gottlieb has dedicated much of his career to explaining the benefits that competition can bring to medicine, and now he\u2019s bringing that experience to one of the most resistant bureaucracies in Washington.Appeared in the July 1, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-06-30 18:53:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-other-republican-health-plan-1498863228", "news_title": "The Other Republican Health Plan", "keywords": "Food and Drug Administration,regulation,government policy,new products,services,new product approvals,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,editorials,pharmaceuticals,health care,life sciences,generic,biosimilar drugs"}, {"content": "A federal jury has found former American Realty Capital Partners Inc. finance chief       Brian Block       guilty of securities fraud after prosecutors accused him of inflating a key financial performance measure, the U.S. Justice Department said Friday.The jury\u2019s verdict, delivered in a Manhattan federal court, comes a year after the publicly traded real-estate investment trust\u2019s former accounting chief,       Lisa McAlister,        pleaded guilty to securities fraud and other charges.Mr. Block was convicted of overstating adjusted funds from operations, a common measure of performance among real-estate investment firms.The Justice Department said an employee identified the overstatement to Mr. Block and Ms. McAlister prior to the public release of the first quarter results in 2014, but didn\u2019t report incorrect calculations to the board or auditors.

That treatment hasn\u2019t been tested on people or animals with Charlie\u2019s condition.Britain\u2019s Supreme Court decided earlier this month that prolonging Charlie\u2019s life would be \u201cnot in his best interests.\u201d His parents asked the European Court of Human Rights to overturn the ruling. The court this week said the case raised \u201csensitive moral and ethical issues\u201d but declined to intervene.\u201cWe are utterly heartbroken,\u201d the parents wrote in a post on             Facebook.       \u201cWe and most importantly Charlie have been massively let down throughout this whole process.\u201dCharlie\u2019s parents, wearing T-shirts with the slogan \u201cIf he\u2019s still fighting, we\u2019re still fighting,\u201d said in a video posted on YouTube on Thursday that doctors had barred them from taking Charlie home to die after the court\u2019s decision. A hospital spokeswoman said she couldn\u2019t discuss details of patient care.Lawyers for the family didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.Under British law, parents have the right to make decisions about the treatment of their children as long as choices don\u2019t contravene a child\u2019s \u201cbest interests.\u201d Usually, it is parents who refuse a treatment for their child on moral or religious grounds who end up in court.In Charlie\u2019s case, it was doctors who wanted to stop treatment, in a move that has generated wide public interest and debate in the U.K., driven by a social-media campaign led by Mr. Gard and Ms. Yates.Joseph J. Fins, a medical ethicist at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York, said he doubted a U.S. court would order withdrawal of care from a child against parents\u2019 wishes. He said judges would likely intervene only if there were a split between parents over what course to pursue or if a child\u2019s own wishes were known.In cases like Charlie\u2019s, \u201cwhat you try to do is to align the needs of the child for palliative care with the parents\u2019 understanding of what is in the child\u2019s best interest,\u201d Dr. Fins said. \u201cUsurping parental rights in a democracy is a decrease in liberty.\u201dDominic Wilkinson, an ethicist at the University of Oxford, said in the U.K., parents, \u201calthough they have a very important role in making lots of decisions for their children including medical decisions, don\u2019t have an absolute right.\u201c If they make harmful choices, the law says \u201cthe state should be allowed to intervene.\u201dThe Catholic Church in England and Wales, in a statement after the EU court\u2019s decision not to hear the case, said it would be wrong to \u201cact with the deliberate intention to end a human life, including the removal of nutrition and hydration so that death might be achieved.\u201d\u201cWe do sometimes, however, have to recognise the limitations of what can be done, while always acting humanely in the service of the sick person until the time of natural death occurs,\u201d the church\u2019s statement said.A spokesman for the Church of England didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. The church, the state church of England, hasn\u2019t made a public statement on the case.Charlie was born in August last year.

GS -0.20%       has begun offloading some of the $2.8 billion in Venezuelan bonds it acquired in a controversial deal involving the country\u2019s central bank, according to people familiar with the matter.The Wall Street firm\u2019s asset-management arm sold at least $300 million face amount of the debt to a small group of hedge funds in recent days, people familiar with the trades said.The firm\u2019s purchase of the bonds in May drew harsh criticism from Venezuelan opposition leaders, some investors and U.S. Sen.       Marco Rubio       (R., Fla.) for supplying cash to authoritarian President       Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.       He is widely unpopular and has been subject to regular protests in a country suffering food and medicine shortages, spiraling inflation and an economy in near free fall.Goldman Sachs Asset Management sold the debt to promote trading of the bonds, which the firm hopes will push up prices and legitimize the securities in the eyes of other investors, people familiar with the trades said.The trades come as Goldman closes its books for the second quarter on Friday, and could justify a higher valuation for the bonds, both in the price bump and by easing the \u201cilliquidity discount\u201d that is often applied to bonds that trade infrequently.The sale of even a sliver of the firm\u2019s holdings shows that some on Wall Street remain eager to trade in Venezuela\u2019s high-yielding debt.Four or five hedge funds in London and New York bought the bonds of state-owned oil company Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela SA, or PdVSA, due in 2022 from Goldman for about 32.5 cents on the dollar, slightly more than the 31 cents the firm paid when it purchased the bonds from Venezuela\u2019s central bank in May, according to people familiar with the matter.Goldman now has company in what has proven to be a controversial investment. In recent weeks, some firm executives have said privately that Goldman\u2019s chief mistake wasn\u2019t in buying the bonds\u2014which fund officials felt were a good deal for their investors\u2014but in going it alone, buying nearly all of the $3 billion issuance. That focused the blowback squarely on Goldman, which is already a lightning rod in the public square, and left it with a shallow market to trade and value the bonds going forward.Wall Street brokers, including             Barclays                   PLC,             Morgan Stanley                   and             Nomura Holdings Inc.       quoted the bonds around 34 cents on the dollar Thursday, investors said. The new buyers are hoping prices will soon rise in line with PdVSA bonds that were issued before Mr. Maduro became president in 2013 and trade around 40 cents, according to people familiar with matter.The discount between the bonds due 2022 and PdVSA\u2019S pre-existing debt partly reflects uncertainty about whether the new debt would be treated equally if Venezuela defaults. Opposition lawmakers have threatened to repudiate the debt should they rise to power.Hedge funds that bought the bonds from Goldman hired lawyers to compare the contracts of the new debt and found them to be virtually identical to those of pre-existing debt, giving the investors confidence that their claims in a default would be the same, the person said.Investment banks have been courting GSAM for weeks to arrange the trade, anticipating the firm\u2019s need to create a market for the bonds.       Sam Finkelstein,        the firm\u2019s head of emerging markets, selected the U.K.-based broker Liquidity Finance because of his relationship with the firm, according to a person familiar with the matter.Liquidity Finance in 2013 hired Goldman\u2019s then-head of Latin America credit trading,       Robert MacDonald,        according to its website.An official for Liquidity Finance said the firm declined to comment.Goldman and the new buyers of the debt are betting a regime change in Venezuela could lift bond prices even if the country defaults. But so far more traditional institutional investors are steering clear of the debt.Corrections & Amplifications   GSAM is an abbreviation for Goldman Sachs Asset Management.

In the past 20 years, only four first-half rallies have been as widespread or better than the current global surge. Two of them preceded sharp market crashes, while two others came at the beginning of multiyear bull markets.In the U.S., the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite surged 14%, its best first half since 2009. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 each rose 8%. But the U.S. wasn\u2019t alone. Stock benchmarks from South Korea to India to Spain were among the biggest risers over the first six months, all registering double-digit percentage gains.Investors attribute the broad breadth of the rally to strengthening corporate earnings, improving economies and continued support from central banks. Europe in particular has been the beneficiary of surprisingly stronger-than-expected economic conditions. A sentiment reading of Eurozone businesses and consumers released this week jumped to its highest level since before the financial crisis. In the U.S., strong earnings growth has been a crucial underpinning of the market\u2019s performance. And a resilient tech sector led by U.S. and Chinese giants has had an increasing influence on markets domestically and in Asia.Despite President       Donald Trump\u2019s       challenges with parts of his agenda, and political jolts in countries from Brazil to the U.K., stock markets have been unusually steady too. Measures of volatility in the year\u2019s first half were at or near multiyear lows not only in the U.S., but also in Europe and Asia.The question for stock investors is whether the strong first six months heralds a choppier second half or the start of a multiyear upswing. The data on global rallies offers a mixed record.A surge in the first half of 1999 preceded the bursting of the tech bubble. The rally to start 2007 came before the global financial crisis. But broad, world-wide gains similar to this year\u2019s also occurred in 2003 and 2009. Both of those were early stages of yearslong market rallies.High stock valuations and tranquil trading this year have prompted concerns that investor complacency is setting in. Federal Reserve Chairwoman       Janet Yellen       warned that asset valuations were \u201csomewhat rich.\u201d The S&P 500 trades at about 18 times projected earnings over the next 12 months, around its highest level in 13 years. Still, this forward multiple was above 26 times at the dot-com bubble\u2019s peak in 2000, according to FactSet.Valuations are more modest elsewhere. In Germany, the DAX trades at less than half its peak multiple in 2000. The Nikkei 225 fetches at 17 times forward earnings, around its average over the past five years.This week, investors tasted the greater uncertainty that could lie ahead, when top European Central Bank officials offered mixed messages on the future of its bond-buying program. Heads of central banks in the U.K. and Canada also indicated they were pondering when to raise interest rates.Stocks and currencies gyrated on the concern of less central-bank accommodation, moves reminiscent of the 2013 \u201ctaper tantrum\u201d in the U.S., touched off when the Fed signaled a reduction in asset purchases.\u201cCentral banks have created huge distortions in the markets, which are going to be difficult to unwind,\u201d said       Colin Graham,        chief investment officer of multiasset solutions at BNP Paribas Asset Management.\u201cBut we think they are going to talk hawkish and walk dovish,\u201d Mr. Graham continued, implying that central banks won\u2019t do anything too drastic that risks roiling markets.The stakes are high. In the U.S., the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite have set numerous records highs in the ninth year of a bull market. Globally, nearly half of the top 30 stock indexes are at or near all-time highs.\u201cWe\u2019re really seeing a synchronized global recovery take shape this year,\u201d said       Graeme Bencke,        global portfolio manager at Pinebridge Investments in London. \u201cEverything is looking better.\u201dThe tech sector\u2019s rising clout has been key. The five largest U.S. companies by market capitalization are tech- and consumer-related companies, led by             Apple Inc.       They propelled the Nasdaq to 38 new closing records this year, its most through the first half of a year since 1986.China\u2019s tech behemoths fared even better.             Tencent Holdings Ltd.      , the world\u2019s largest videogame publisher by revenue, and China\u2019s largest social network, WeChat, have jumped more than 40% this year.             Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.      , the online marketplace, surged roughly 60%, pushing the MSCI Asia Ex Japan Index up more than 20% for the year.Even sectors that have mostly underperformed this year, such as financials, have belatedly joined in. After all major U.S. banks passed the Fed\u2019s annual stress tests, analysts say they look attractive again. Banks including             Citigroup Inc.       and             Bank of America Corp.       said they would boost share buybacks and dividends.Among the few losers this year were energy stocks, thanks to oil\u2019s sharp decline.             Exxon Mobil Corp.       and             Chevron Corp.       were some of the Dow\u2019s worst performers.One irony is that this year\u2019s market gains have come about for different reasons than many expected in January.Investors then hoped Donald Trump\u2019s election victory would trigger lower taxes, less regulation and more infrastructure spending. Many believed U.S. interest rates would rise, the dollar would strengthen and oil would keep rising.Abroad, there were worries Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency would spark trade tensions that might hit emerging markets. A close French presidential election loomed over Europe\u2019s prospects.So far, though, Mr. Trump hasn\u2019t enacted major changes to fiscal policy or taken significant protectionist measures. In France, pro-Europe       Emmanuel Macron       eventually romped to election victory, allaying fears about the rise of anti-European Union sentiment.Through it all, the market\u2019s focus has instead remained on central bankers, the pattern since the financial crisis. While the U.S. has raised short-term interest rates four times since the end of 2015, the ECB and Bank of Japan have mostly remained accommodative, helping juice asset prices. U.S. government bond yields have fallen, the dollar has weakened and oil prices have declined.\u201cIt really has been a first half of the contrarian trade,\u201d said       Mark Tinker,        head of Framlington Equities Asia at AXA Investment Managers, which has $835 billion under management.Investors point to the pickup in earnings growth as a vital driver of global gains this year. In the U.S., first-quarter earnings from S&P 500 companies increased 14% from a year earlier, the best growth since 2011. Analysts now expect roughly double-digit profit growth this year and in 2018, according to FactSet.Earnings in Asia-Pacific, excluding Japan, and in Europe, which had disappointed for years, also increased at a double-digit rate in the first quarter.\u201cEurope has gone from a headwind to a tailwind,\u201d said       Mark Matthews,        head of research for Asia at Swiss private bank             Julius Baer.       \u201cThere was a fear that the euro was unraveling. The fear is behind us.\u201dNot every market has rallied. Russian stocks were among the world\u2019s worst-performing equity markets, dropping 14%. Oil\u2019s fall and the possibility of tighter sanctions hit stocks there after their strong surge in 2016. Indexes in Israel, China and Canada were the other rare decliners in the first half.The tricky part now, investors say, is picking which regions will continue rallying. Bargain-hunting opportunities have been rare and fleeting. Brazilian shares tanked in May amid a fresh political scandal. But global fund flows to the country soared the week after, and the market quickly bounced back.Meantime, comments from some investors suggest doubts are creeping in.\u201cWe\u2019ve never been in a period like this,\u201d Mr. Bencke of PineBridge Investments said. \u201cIt\u2019s like central banks are slowly pulling the rug from under your feet. My hope is they\u2019ll move slowly, and the world will err on the side of caution.\u201d\u2014Demi Guo contributed to this article.Write to Steven Russolillo at steven.russolillo@wsj.comCorrections & Amplifications   A sentiment reading of Eurozone businesses and consumers was released this week; an earlier version of this article incorrectly stated the data were released Friday.

Some saw this as a sign that falling oil prices from the spring have forced U.S. producers to slow.That idea was reinforced Friday when oil-field services company         Baker Hughes Inc.       reported the number of working rigs in the country fell\u2014by two\u2014last week for the first time in nearly six months. Prices, already up for the day, surged again after the data release through the last 90 minutes of trading.Light, sweet crude for August settled up $1.11, or 2.5%, at $46.04 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent gained 50 cents, or 1.1%, to $47.92 a barrel on ICE Futures Europe.Both are on seven-session winning streaks that brought them to their highest point since June 13. Brent\u2019s streak is the longest since June 2014. For U.S. oil, it is the longest since August.The rebound comes at a down time in the crude markets. Fears that rising U.S. production might cancel out cutbacks from global exporters have led to several monthly losses in a row for oil prices, losing streaks that have now extended through June despite the recent gains. U.S. oil and Brent lost more than 4.7% for the month and more than 9% for the quarter. Back-to-back losses for the quarter reached around 15%, marking the worst back-to-back quarters since the period that ended in March 2016.The recent winning streak, however, is confirmation that the worst of oil\u2019s correction is behind it, according to analysts at TD Securities in Toronto. The team, which has frequently been bullish this year, said lower prices are forcing U.S. producers to spend less and limiting their access to money, both from fewer loans and from limited opportunities to keep selling future production.Summer driving season is also likely to increase demand in the weeks to come. And that along with the slowdown from U.S. drillers will lead to an easing glut and rising prices because about 2% of global supply is already held back by output cuts from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and other exporters, the TD Securities analysts said.\u201cWe\u2019re questioning whether we get those massive gains (in U.S. production) that will make the OPEC cuts moot,\u201d said Bart Melek, head of commodity strategy at TD Securities in Toronto.The market had already been getting a boost early Friday from positioning, as traders attempt to close out or simply hold pat ahead of the weekend and July 4 holiday in the U.S., several analysts and a trader said. Money managers had spent weeks piling into bearish positions on U.S. oil, and any widespread push to close out positions could likely lead to a reversal of those bearish trades, a rush to buy back contracts that bids up prices.\u201cIt\u2019s the end of the month, end of the quarter, end of the first half of the year, so there\u2019s a lot of book squaring taking place, and a lot of people sitting on the sidelines who don\u2019t want to mess up their books,\u201d said Donald Morton, senior vice president at Herbert J. Sims & Co.Bearish traders switched their positions earlier this week on the U.S. production data, said       Ole Hansen,        head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank. The trend could continue for weeks, with investors switching back to bullish bets that take U.S. oil toward $60 a barrel by year\u2019s end, the TD Securities analysts said.Still, investors remain skeptical that oil prices have stabilized because fundamentals remain quite bearish. Many industry observers worry the oil glut is at risk of getting bigger as Libya and Nigeria crank up production and oil companies in the U.S. keep putting more rigs to work.Meanwhile, demand growth globally is also clouding the outlook on crude prices. BMI Research data show that in the first quarter, U.S. fuel consumption was nearly flat compared with the same period last year, while South Korea showed smaller-than-expected growth and Japan\u2019s demand contracted by 3% on year.\u201cOverall the risk to our global demand outlook lies to the downside,\u201d the research firm said.Gasoline futures gained 2.96 cents, or 2%, to $1.5152 a gallon, leading to weekly gains of 5.7% that snapped a five-week losing streak and were the biggest weekly gains since March. Prices were still down 6% for the month and 11% for the quarter.Diesel futures rose 2.95 cents, or 2%, to $1.4755 a gallon, leading to weekly gains of 7.6% that snapped a five-week losing streak and were the biggest weekly gains in seven months.

The yield was up from 2.146% the previous Friday, marking the largest weekly increase since March.Yields, which rise as bond prices fall, were relatively steady for much of the U.S. trading session, hovering a little above Thursday levels. But the 10-year yield climbed toward 2.3% just before the 3 p.m. settlement, suggesting investors remain on edge about central banks potentially scaling back on easy-money policies.Government bonds across the developed world have been under pressure since European Central Bank President       Mario Draghi      hinted Tuesday the central bank could start tapering its massive asset purchases. Similar signals from top officials at the Bank of England and the Bank of Canada have added to investors\u2019 anxiety.The global bond selloff spread to Asia Friday, pushing the yield on Japan\u2019s benchmark 10-year government bond to the highest level in more than three months. Markets, though, began to stabilize during trading in Europe and got some added support after data showed eurozone inflation slowed for a second straight month in June.Expectations of inflation remaining below central banks\u2019 targets had pushed down bond yields in the weeks leading up to the selloff. The yield on the U.S. Treasury note closed at 2.135% on Monday, its lowest level since November and a significant drop from its recent peak of 2.609% in March.Inflation is a main threat to long-term government bonds, eroding the purchasing power of their fixed returns.Further reasserting the theme of soft inflation, the Commerce Department reported Friday morning that the Federal Reserve\u2019s preferred measure of inflation, the price index for personal-consumption expenditures, fell on an annualized basis to 1.4% in May, its lowest level in six months. Core prices were also up 1.4% on the year in May, the lowest level since December 2015.Momentum toward higher yields on Friday was up against the typical demand that occurs at the end of each month, as some investors add to their bondholdings to replicate changes within bond indexes.That government bond yields were still modestly higher Friday was a sign the \u201cglobal bond market does want to sell off,\u201d said Gennadiy Goldberg, U.S. rates strategist, at TD Securities in New York.Selling hit shorter-term Treasurys as well as longer-term bonds. The yield on the two-year note, which is especially sensitive to changes in the Fed\u2019s interest-rate policy, rose to 1.385% from 1.373% Thursday. That was its highest close since 2009.Central banks such as the ECB, Bank of Japan and the Fed bought massive amounts of bonds as they tried to shore up their economies in the wake of the financial crisis, which helped drive yields to extreme lows. The Fed stopped adding to its bondholdings in 2014 and has since started raising short-term rates. The recent remarks from Mr. Draghi and others suggest more central banks might be following suit, leaving investors increasingly on the lookout for clues about the timing of such a shift.The selloff poses a particular challenge to the BOJ, which has pledged to keep the yield on 10-year Japanese government bonds near zero, buying as many bonds as it needs to do so.A shift toward tighter monetary policy globally could lead to a sustained increase in yields, forcing the Japanese central bank to buy more bonds. That could pose a challenge, as the bank already owns roughly 40% of outstanding government bonds, by its own count, and could eventually run out of bonds to buy.But an extended selloff could also not happen. Bond markets have been hit by a number of selloffs in recent years\u2014some caused by concerns about the potential for less accommodative monetary policies\u2014that proved short-lived.This selloff has been relatively contained. Investors are still showing strong appetite for emerging-market debt, for example. India\u2019s 10-year yield rose to 6.510% from 6.460% last Friday, a smaller advance than the move in Australian yields.Likewise, U.S. corporate bonds have barely moved: the average junk-rated bond yield was 5.63% Thursday, compared with 5.66% a week earlier, according to Bloomberg Barclays data.\u2014Suryatapa Bhattacharya contributed to this article.Write to Sam Goldfarb at sam.goldfarb@wsj.com, Saumya Vaishampayan at saumya.vaishampayan@wsj.com and Christopher Whittall at christopher.whittall@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-30 16:20:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/bond-selloff-infects-asia-as-central-banks-hint-at-end-of-easy-money-era-1498808158", "news_title": "Government Bond Selloff Extends to Fourth Day  ", "keywords": "bonds,bond selloff,bond yields,central banks,ecb,fed,federal reserve,mario draghi,Bank of Japan,Federal Reserve,economic performance,indicators,inflation,prices,economic news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,debt,bond markets,commodity,financial market news,government debt,national government debt,banking,central banking,credit,financial services"}, {"content": "CHICAGO\u2014The Chicago Police Department\u00a0said Friday it is teaming up with federal agencies to crack down on illegal weapons and step up the prosecution of repeat gun offenders, a move aimed at bringing down the city\u2019s violent-crime rate.The effort was quickly claimed by President Donald Trump\u2019s administration as evidence that Mr. Trump has made good on his promise to bring down gun violence in the city through federal assistance.\u201cCrime and killings in Chicago have reached such epidemic proportions that I am sending in Federal help,\u201d Mr. Trump, a Republican, wrote on Twitter Friday morning.Several hours later, the Chicago Police Department officially made public the partnership with the federal government, including the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and federal prosecutors.The initiative, known as the Chicago Crime Gun Strike Force, is to be led by a specialized team of Chicago police officers, federal agents, state troopers and others who together will focus on the problem of illegal guns on the city\u2019s streets.\u201cThis is more than just a new strategy or tactic,\u201d said Anthony Riccio, chief of the Police Department\u2019s organized crime bureau. \u201cWe are fundamentally changing the way we fight crime in Chicago.\u201dThe ATF plans to send 20 additional agents to Chicago for the new initiative, which will also lean heavily on federal technology and resources like a mobile ballistics testing van that can analyze shell casings at a crime scene. The technology will allow police to get crucial results from evidence in \u201chours rather than days,\u201d police said.Chicago had sought additional help from the bureau last year when former President       Barack Obama,        a Democrat, was in office.\u201c[There were] two administrations that the superintendent has been dealing with in order to get assistance from the ATF,\u201d said Kevin Navarro, the Police Department\u2019s first deputy superintendent.Chicago ended last year with 762 homicides and more than 4,000 shootings, a dramatic rise that has drawn national attention and led Mr. Trump to tweet on multiple instances about \u201csending in the Feds\u201d if city officials couldn\u2019t handle the problem.In a statement\u00a0Friday, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said Mr. Trump\u2019s administration \u201cwill not let the bloodshed go on.\u201dAs of Thursday, the city has seen about 220 fewer shootings this year, compared with the same time last year, about a 14% reduction. There was a similar drop in shooting victims.Homicides, however, have remained largely flat in 2017, with 320 killings as of\u00a0Thursday, just two less than this time last year.Police have attributed the drop in shooting incidents and victims to new predictive policing technology rolled out in the most dangerous neighborhoods which, among other things, helps officers plan their patrol routes based on a prediction of where crime might occur next.The drop in the number of people shot this year is \u201ca start,\u201d Mr. Navarro said. Overall, levels of violent crime \u201cis going in the right direction,\u201d he said.Adam Collins, a spokesman for Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, a Democrat, said the progress made by the Police Department \u201chas happened without any of the new resources from the federal government we requested.\u201dA small number of cities last year, including Chicago, experienced a surge in violent crime not seen since the 1990s. The increase in violence has continued in several cities, including Baltimore.In Baltimore, homicides are up about 25% this year, compared with the same period in 2016, according to Baltimore Police Department statistics.

It lasted from the mid-19th through the early 20th century and, to most scholars, it committed grievous sins. The paintings were crassly commercial, as opposed to, say, works by scholar artists expressing erudition, wit and veiled commentary. The artists portrayed objects hyper-realistically, an approach dismissed as gimmickry by a tradition that valued distillation over representation. Not to mention their subject matter\u2014bapo artists reproduced, quite literally, scraps.China\u2019s 8 Brokens: Puzzles of the Treasured PastMuseum of Fine Arts, Boston  Through Oct. 29Some 25 years later, Ms. Berliner is curator of Chinese art at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, and is giving this intriguing genre its due. Since she joined the MFA in 2012, the institution has acquired some 40 bapo paintings, making it the largest museum collection of its kind. Now, with \u201cChina\u2019s 8 Brokens: Puzzles of the Treasured Past,\u201d she has staged the genre\u2019s grand debut. While the show includes some decorated objects and a most amazing piece of embroidery (all on loan), the primary focus is on paintings. From a distance, they look like collages of writings, paintings and rubbings the artist has salvaged\u2014edges are torn, frayed, or charred; ink rubbings of inscriptions have faded patches; paintings have folds and rips, missing sections and insect damage.In a few, the artist emulated 17th-century art lovers, who displayed cherished works by pasting them onto a screen. In most, however, the bits and pieces cascade down the length of a scroll, clump, and occasionally coalesce into the shape of a dragon, scepter, or coin. Such forms are auspicious, as are some texts reproduced in the paintings. This explains the show\u2019s title: It is a translation of bapo, which combines the lucky charms of the number eight and the notion of incompleteness. But that\u2019s not all the paintings are about.At one level, there\u2019s quite a lot of boasting going on. Artists are showing off their knowledge and skill, while buyers are advertising themselves as men so cultured they recognize snippets of poetry, allusions, ancient masterpieces. Yet there is something almost tongue-in-cheek about paying homage to ancient masters using frowned-upon realism. And while the artists purport to duplicate the real thing, some play tricks. A painting by       Wu Chunkui       includes a rubbing with a large crack, yet the stone it replicates has never suffered such damage. What are we to make of that?Or, for that matter, of artists mixing in mundane mementos like a ticket stub, toothpaste wrapper, or matchbox label? It is tempting to see pastiches of classic and modern\u2014the revered poem tossed in with the discarded wrapper\u2014as criticisms of China\u2019s veneration of the past. Or perhaps as sermons about the futility of earthly pursuits, be they highbrow or lowbrow. This was my first reaction and, Ms. Berliner says, hers. But the timeline she has pieced together and the texts she has translated\u2014both of which the show outlines nicely\u2014cast a different light on bapo. Consider that, from 1850 until 1864, fighters in the Taiping Rebellion disparaged tradition, killed millions and laid waste to a great swath of the country. Elsewhere, Muslim rebels staged uprisings, some lasting until the late 1870s. China\u2019s last imperial dynasty was flailing, finally falling in 1911/12. And all the while Western-style modernity was encroaching at an ever-quickening pace.No single interpretation fits all. Some artists might have been calling attention to the value in the ordinary\u2014does a printed school primer not belong in the venerable history of imparting knowledge? Is the invention of toothpaste not wonderful? But it seems likely that others harbored darker thoughts. The hope that \u201cworm-eaten pages may have spirits preserved within\u201d appears in one; in another, a poem mourning the destruction of past treasures.

The callers, whom he described as \u201cat the very top of the administration\u201d but didn\u2019t identify by name, said that if he called Mr. Trump and apologized for their earlier presidential coverage, Mr. Trump \u201cwill pick up the phone and basically spike this story.\u201dMr. Trump rejected that version of events, saying instead that Mr. Scarborough called Mr. Trump to stop the article\u2019s publication. \u201cHe called me to stop a National Enquirer article.

Mr. Pecker wasn\u2019t immediately available for comment.The Enquirer supported Mr. Trump during the campaign, endorsing him and publishing columns by Mr. Trump as the primary race got under way. The Wall Street Journal also reported last year that American Media had agreed to pay a former Playboy model $150,000 for her story of an alleged affair with Mr. Trump, but then didn\u2019t publish it.In a statement, Dylan Howard, chief content officer and vice president of American Media, said the publication had no knowledge of the situation involving Mr. Trump.\u201cAt the beginning of June we accurately reported a story that recounted the relationship between Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski, the truth of which is not in dispute,\u201d said Mr. Howard. \u201cAt no time did we threaten either Joe or Mika or their children in connection with our reporting on the story.\u00a0We have no knowledge of any discussions between the White House and Joe and Mika about our story, and absolutely no involvement in those discussions.\u201dThe Enquirer in early June published an article headlined \u201c \u2018Morning Joe\u2019 Sleazy Cheating Scandal!\u201d Ms. Brzezinski and Mr. Scarborough, who were both previously married, announced in early May that they are engaged.The scuffle over the Enquirer emerged as part of a broader discussion the news anchors were having about the president and what they say is an \u201cunhealthy obsession\u201d with their morning show.On Thursday, Mr. Trump drew widespread condemnation, including from members of his own party, after he attacked Ms. Brzezinski on Twitter, calling her \u201clow I.Q.

The first was President       Dwight Eisenhower,        who championed the notion of continental superhighways before signing, in 1956, the law that authorized the Interstate Highway System. It reflected an American passion for the open road, as symbolized in popular culture by the ad jingle \u201cSee the U.S.A. in your Chevrolet\u201d and       Jack Kerouac\u2019s       novel \u201cOn the Road,\u201d written in 1951.The second man was       Wallace Libby Hardison.       In 1870s Pennsylvania, he and a partner,       Lyman Stewart,        successfully wildcatted for oil until       John D. Rockefeller       put everyone like them out of business. Undaunted, the pair left for the land of opportunity\u2014California\u2014where ambition and industry were all a man needed to succeed. They struck oil in what is today Ventura County and founded the Union Oil Co., later known as Unocal. A few years on, Hardison and another Maine transplant,       Nathan Weston Blanchard,        gambled big by buying 400 acres and planting citrus. Thus was born the Limoneira Company, now one of North America\u2019s largest growers of lemons and avocados.The third man who came to mind was Edmund G. \u201cPat\u201d Brown. As governor from 1959-67, his ambition was to make California the most livable state and thereby dethrone New York as the nation\u2019s most populous. To that end, he turned the Golden State\u2019s public university system into the world\u2019s finest; built roads, bridges and other infrastructure; and constructed a water-delivery system that ensured adequate supply everywhere, from California\u2019s agricultural center, to its coastal cities, to its deserts.By the end of 1962\u2014days before the governor\u2019s second inaugural\u2014enough Americans had moved here for him to declare victory and ring a bell kicking off a 72-hour statewide celebration. \u201cMy son asked me what I hoped to accomplish as governor,\u201d Brown once said. \u201cI told him, essentially, to make life more comfortable for people, as far as government can.\u201dThat son who\u2019d asked him was the fourth person I thought of while driving: Jerry Brown, California\u2019s present governor. I was struck by the chasm that separated him from his father, Eisenhower and Hardison. Those three men believed government\u2019s role was to provide Americans wider opportunities to pursue individual happiness\u2014which worked particularly well in California, where there was more liberty than infrastructure. Jerry Brown, by contrast, appears to believe that happiness is a collective notion and that the endpoint of helping \u201cas far as government can\u201d is visible only through the Hubble telescope.Take his insistence that California spend unknown billions of dollars on a bullet train connecting Southern and Northern California. Every poll shows that few people intend to ride it. Why? Because taking your own car will be faster and cheaper than driving to a station, parking, riding with stops along the way, and then renting a car or hailing an Uber at your destination. And anyway, tickets to fly between L.A. and San Francisco\u2014which the train won\u2019t even reach directly\u2014can be had for less than $100. Why ride a rail that\u2019s routed not along the state\u2019s scenic coast (already served by Amtrak\u2019s Coast Starlight) but through its distinctly unlovely interior?An even more utopian folly is Mr. Brown\u2019s determination to establish California as a model for climate-change politics and policy. It goes without saying that one state\u2014or even one country\u2014cannot reduce carbon emissions enough to benefit the climate in a meaningful way. The true consequence of the governor\u2019s ubergreen policies is to reverse his father\u2019s migration, at least for productive citizens and businesses. They\u2019re leaving California for states where energy is cheaper, taxes are lower, and the regulatory burden is lighter. Middle-aged people making $100,000 to $200,000 a year are the largest cohort of those moving out, according to researchers       Joel Kotkin       and       Wendell Cox.Two years ago, Mr. Brown signed a bill requiring state-regulated utilities to produce, by 2030, 50% of their electricity from renewable sources like wind and solar. Although those are highly subsidized, Californians still pay about 50% more for power than the national average. Gasoline is no better. The moment my car crossed the state line from Arizona, a gallon of gas instantly cost a dollar more, and nearly twice what I\u2019d paid in Louisiana. The higher price can be blamed on not only taxes but the cost of refining gas to California\u2019s exacting specifications, a 25-year-old antipollution program that may well have outlived its need.California\u2019s gas taxes were, until recently, a mere 30% higher than the nationwide average, yet its streets and highways tend to be in poor shape compared with those in other states. So in April the governor strong-armed the Legislature into raising gas taxes 12 cents a gallon and annual vehicle fees $50. The extra $5 billion a year will barely address a backlog of repairs estimated at more than $100 billion. And there\u2019s no ironclad guarantee the funds will be allocated to road improvements at all. Yet the governor dismissed his opponents as unworthy of argument. \u201cRoads require money to fix,\u201d Mr. Brown said. \u201cThe freeloaders\u2014I\u2019ve had enough of them.\u201dFor most of human history, people spent much of their day in search of calories. Only in the past century and a half have those concerns been obviated by plentiful fossil-fuel energy that spurred new technologies and literally built California. See:       W.L. Hardison.       If Gov. Brown is looking for a legacy worthy of his father, he\u2019d do well to take a page from California\u2019s history of relying on the grit and ingenuity of Californians. Left unshackled, the species that invented language, music, and single-malt scotch can overcome whatever Mother Nature is going to do anyway, notwithstanding the state\u2019s shrinking carbon footprint.Mr. Engel is author, most recently, of \u201cL.A. \u201956: A Devil in the City of Angels.\u201dAppeared in the July 1, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-06-30 15:57:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/californias-rise-and-fall-from-one-gov-brown-to-another-1498852630", "news_title": "California\u2019s Rise and Fall, From One Gov.

He also said Pyongyang\u2019s provocations require a \u201cstrong response.\u201dTheir statements marked an effort to signal to North Korea that there is no daylight between the new U.S. and South Korean leaders on their preferred approaches to the country, even though Mr. Trump has taken a hard-line stance while Mr. Moon has called for talks.Mr. Moon in his comments said that Mr. Trump accepted his invitation to visit South Korea this year.The two leaders also discussed differences on economic issues, particularly trade.\u201cWe are renegotiating a trade deal right now as we speak with South Korea and hopefully it will be an equitable deal, a fair deal to both parties,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a rough deal for the United States, but I think it will be much different.\u201dMr. Trump, following a Thursday evening tweet revealing \u201ca new trade deal\u201d with South Korea, said he was encouraged by Mr. Moon\u2019s assurances that \u201che will work to level the playing field.\u201dMr. Trump said U.S. officials are discussing barriers to the auto trade and the export of \u201cdumped\u201d steel from South Korea.Business leaders have been pushing for the U.S. and South Korea to address differences on trade without opening up an existing trade agreement to full renegotiation.Mr. Trump has kept up his fiery rhetoric on trade with respect to South Korea. He threatened to withdraw from the five-year-old trade agreement in April.U.S. Trade Representative       Robert Lighthizer       told lawmakers last week that the administration is looking very closely at the South Korea free-trade agreement but there are \u201cno plans to drop out.\u201dThe agreement\u2014the second-biggest U.S. deal measured by trading volume\u2014contains a mechanism called the joint committee that allows the countries to address problems with the pact.\u201cAt the direction of the president, Ambassador Lighthizer is calling a special joint committee meeting to begin the process of renegotiating and amending the deal,\u201d White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Friday. \u201cThe president is committed to getting a better deal for the American people.\u201dA spokeswoman for Mr. Lighthizer declined to comment Friday on plans for the agreement.The renewed economic pressure on South Korea was met with concern from a key GOP lawmaker.\u201cI\u2019m a little surprised by the decision to renegotiate our Korea trade agreement when there is such urgency for us to address America\u2019s absence in the larger Asia-Pacific region,\u201d said Rep.       Kevin Brady       of Texas, chairman of the House committee that oversees trade. He said the Korea agreement has been \u201csuccessful.\u201dThe U.S. imported $69.9 billion in goods from South Korea last year but exported only $42.3 billion, resulting in a trade deficit of $27.6 billion. Five years earlier, the trade deficit was $13 billion.Mr. Trump and his advisers frequently cite trade deficit figures as a sign that other countries may be blocking U.S. imports. Most economists say that deficits stem from broad economic factors and that the U.S. benefits from its imports as well as exports.The U.S. exported $1.6 billion in passenger cars last year to South Korea, compared with $417 million five years ago. But Korean car exports to the U.S. were 10 times as high, at $16 billion last year.Some U.S. industry and labor critics say South Korea has kept its currency artificially cheap against the dollar in the past, gaining a trade advantage.Seoul denies manipulating its currency for trade advantage, saying it intervenes for the purpose of smoothing out short-term fluctuations.South Korea is a major source of steel in the U.S. as special tariffs are blocking many types of Chinese steel due to alleged dumping and subsidies.American officials blame China\u2019s high production of steel for contributing to a global glut that shows up in low-price imports from South Korea and other countries, and the Trump administration is conducting an investigation that could end in broad barriers against global steel imports.On Thursday, the new South Korean leader told congressional leaders that he wouldn\u2019t seek to cancel or reverse the deployment of a missile-defense system that is aimed at countering North Korea and supported by the U.S.Mr. Moon\u2019s remark was his clearest statement yet on a contentious topic that has been marked by misunderstandings about the new South Korean administration\u2019s intentions on the system, called Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense, or Thaad.The meeting Friday came amid concerns in both Washington and Seoul about the strength of the alliance under Messrs. Trump and Moon. Mr. Trump has also sown confusion by suggesting that South Korea should pay more for the U.S. military presence in South Korea, which includes about 28,500 soldiers.\u2014Jonathan Cheng in Seoul contributed to this article.Write to Carol E.

QuinnDayton, OhioThe decline in microcap and small-cap company listings over the past 15 years is proof positive of the unintended consequences of certain regulatory compliance mandates required in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, specifically Sections 302, 404 and 906. Collectively, these three sections require cash-challenged development-stage and emerging-growth companies to comply with the same onerous and expensive financial internal-control requirements, annual audited financial requirements and CEO and CFO certification requirements as Fortune 1000 companies. Such compliance costs are too onerous for companies to incur in advance of an IPO when they could otherwise deploy capital for research and development to improve their product or service offering.Sarbanes-Oxley has become an anchor on economic growth and a drag on employment. Without question the act has improved shareholder rights by increasing transparency and accountability, but it discourages companies from accessing public equity markets. Meanwhile, many microcap and small-cap companies have delisted to avoid the continued onerous and disproportional cost of being publicly traded.

After being virtually banned from the U.S. for years over his failure to control anti-Muslim riots in his home state of Gujarat in 2002, he came to Washington for a triumphant first visit Monday with President       Donald Trump      \u2014complete with bear hugs, defense deals and a welcoming tweet from the first lady.The Hindu nationalist\u2019s arrival in Washington was a reminder that of all the recent revolutions at the ballot box, Mr. Modi\u2019s was the first. This week, pundits noted similarities between the two populist leaders: Both Mr. Trump and Mr. Modi have made political careers out of anti-Muslim animus, tapped nationalist passions, stoked the fires of intolerance and pursued vendettas against impertinent media outlets.Yet these symmetries unfold in fundamentally different contexts. America has experienced a political upheaval, but it retains that supreme achievement of a mature democracy: It has two credible sides, left and right; the two sides have held, more or less; and the pendulum may swing again before long.India has experienced something quite different in the three years since Mr. Modi took power. The \u201cother side\u201d\u2014liberal India, secular India, the India of Nehru and Gandhi\u2014hasn\u2019t merely been decimated electorally; it has ceased to exist as a cultural and moral force.

In state elections this March, Mr. Modi\u2019s Bharatiya Janata Party, or BJP, won some 300 of the 400 seats. Mr. Modi\u2019s choice of chief minister was Yogi Adityanath, a Hindu priest in saffron robes and longtime parliamentarian. His anti-Muslim rhetoric has been so hateful\u2014he has told his followers that if Muslims \u201ckill one Hindu man, then we will kill 100 Muslim men\u201d\u2014that he was once beyond the pale. Today, his popularity threatens to eclipse Mr. Modi\u2019s. As S. Prasannarajan, the editor of Open magazine, told me recently, \u201cYogi Adityanath becoming chief minister of [Uttar Pradesh] is the single biggest event in Indian politics since Modi became chief minister of Gujarat.\u201dOn my flight to Gorakhpur was R.P.N. Singh, a member of the ancien r\u00e9gime and a former member of Parliament from the opposition Congress Party. (The party of Nehru was reduced to 44 seats out of 543 in 2014.) Mr. Singh\u2014a graduate of India\u2019s equivalent of Andover, the son of an MP, and a minister under Indira Gandhi\u2014was well-mannered, soft-spoken and self-effacing. After the flight, he introduced me to a BJP politician in the corrugated iron shed that is Gorakhpur airport.The BJP man, dressed in a saffron kurta, with a chrome watch around his wrist and an expensive gold pen dangling from his pocket, looked the part of a venal politician. He was unable to resist mentioning that he had been repeatedly elected, which felt like a jab at the recently defeated Mr. Singh, and I realized that Indian politics now belonged to this other kind of leader. The class of person Mr. Singh represented had served\u2014as Nehru had\u2014as intermediaries between India and the West. But that age of custodianship was over, and India was in Indian hands, as it had never been before.The effects of this change were visible in cinema too. A new kind of movie, with a bold, mythical Hindu theme, had become the biggest Indian hit of all time. \u201cBaahubali 2: The Conclusion\u201d\u2014the tale of \u201cwarring cousins who fight for the kingship of an ancient kingdom,\u201d as the Times of India put it\u2014was not a Bollywood film but a south Indian film. (The south Indian states each have robust film industries, but they are regional; never before has a south Indian film so dominated the national and international stage.)       Karan Johar      \u2014the film\u2019s distributor in north India\u2014told me that it had defied all expectations.Its director hadn\u2019t intended it to cater to the Hindu right; but, by exciting old myths of valor and strength, it had. Steeped in Hindu ideas of kingship and virtue, the film diverged from traditional Bollywood pieties about a shared Hindu-Muslim culture. Mr. Modi\u2019s India has scant room for romantic ideas about Muslims or their place in Indian society.The remaking of India\u2019s cultural landscape was affecting the English media too. When I was covering the 2014 election for Open magazine, there were two\u2014maybe three\u2014English-speaking journalists who openly supported Mr. Modi, and they were pariahs for it. Three years on, the change was staggering. Old TV hosts with bow ties and Oxbridge accents were being weeded out;       Barkha Dutt,        the country\u2019s most famous liberal anchor, was off the air; and earlier this month, the owners of New Delhi Television, a private broadcaster critical of the government, were raided by a government agency. But the raid almost wasn\u2019t needed: The channel, out of step with the times, was fading. Meanwhile, a new nationalist channel had taken to the air, making no distinction between enemies of the government and enemies of the country. Within weeks, Republic TV had seized a 52% market share, according to the Broadcast Audience Research Council of India.The most obvious consequence of India\u2019s new anti-Muslim atmosphere has been a spate of gruesome cow and beef-related murders. The cow is sacred to Hindus, but the current hysteria has been engineered. During his 2014 campaign, Mr. Modi whipped crowds into frenzies over a supposed conspiracy by his political foes to slaughter cows and export beef.Since he took power, India has seen more than 60 incidents of cow-related mob violence, in which the overwhelming bulk of the 23 reported fatalities were Muslim. Mr. Modi has had very little to say about these deaths. On Wednesday, anti-lynching protests erupted in cities nationwide, and Mr. Modi finally bluntly condemned the violence. \u201cWe belong to a land of nonviolence,\u201d he said, invoking Gandhi.But it may be too late; the Indian street is on the boil. In the U.S., Mr. Trump faces a free press, a galvanized opposition and a Republican Party with deepening misgivings. In India, Mr. Modi faces only himself.\u2014Mr. Taseer is the author, most recently, of the novel \u201cThe Way Things Were.\u201d", "news_time": "2017-06-30 15:44:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/modis-illiberal-new-india-1498851889", "news_title": "Modi\u2019s Illiberal New India ", "keywords": "baahubali 2,bharatiya janata party,donald trump,hindu nationalist,india,lynching,modi,narendra modi,uttar pradesh,yogi adityanath,Narendra Modi,bollywood,political,general news,society,community,international relations,arts,entertainment,movies,politics,domestic politics,social issues,elections,national,presidential elections,media"}, {"content": "By now you have read 15 articles on the Seattle minimum-wage fiasco. Since the city boosted its local minimum from $9.47 in 2014 to $13 last year (on its way to $15), a detailed investigation by University of Washington economists finds that beneficiaries actually saw their incomes fall by a net $125 a month because employers cut their hours.When the price of something goes up, buyers demand less of it. This law of economics, like any law, some will always find inconvenient. But here\u2019s the rest of the story.The impetus came from people who don\u2019t actually earn the minimum wage\u2014labor-union leaders and think-tankers and activist organizations. The Service Employees International Union, as it has been happy to tell anyone, including a writer for the Atlantic Monthly two years ago, was already plowing $30 million into the \u201cfight for $15\u201d even though virtually all the hoped-for benefits would go to nonmembers.There was even pushback from various union locals. Was this really a good use of our dues when most members already earn well above the minimum and have other priorities?As the union also was not shy about noting, the real target was a very specific company,             McDonald\u2019s,       which SEIU dreams of organizing despite the historically unwelcoming nature of franchise-based industries.How a $15 minimum leads toward this halcyon day was never exactly spelled out, but here\u2019s the answer: $15 would be used to change the basic labor-market bargain implied between the fast-food industry and its workers. Fifteen dollars an hour amounts to $31,200 a year and hardly a princely living. But you start adding mandated benefits and think about two-income households, and now you\u2019re talking about a job that will sustain a different kind of life strategy than a Golden Arches job will today.Organizers look fondly to Denmark, where a McDonald\u2019s line worker receives $41,000 a year and five weeks of paid vacation. As the Atlantic put it two years ago, \u201cUnionizing workers at McDonald\u2019s and other fast-food chains might be a long shot, but if it succeeds, it might help lift a million or more workers into the middle class (or at least into the lower middle class) and create a model for low-wage workers in other industries.\u201dThis sounds pretty but is misleading in a fundamental way. The workers a McDonald\u2019s franchise would hire at $15 an hour are different from those it would hire at $8.29, the average earned by a fast-food worker today.Costs would go up. The industry would likely shrink, it would likely replace workers with automation, but it would still create jobs at $15 an hour for people whose productivity can justify $15 an hour. The people who work at McDonald\u2019s today, typically, would already be earning $15 an hour somewhere else if their productivity could justify $15 an hour.Everybody needs to start somewhere, including the unskilled and those who lack a work history. Some need a job that doesn\u2019t demand much of them. They have other obligations. They accept less pay to maximize flexibility and freedom from responsibility. They don\u2019t plan to make a career of it. The fast-food industry in America is built on such people.Proponents like to argue that employers, especially in the fast-food business, actually benefit from an increased minimum. It enables them to attract a more dedicated, productive employee. But why shouldn\u2019t employers be left to make this trade-off themselves? And what about the people who won\u2019t get hired at $15 and lose the benefit of a fast-food opportunity that is one of the easiest, quickest jobs to land in America?When President Obama joined the fight in 2015, he argued that a full-time job should be able to support a family. This sounded pretty too, but was a way of saying that jobs that won\u2019t support a family shouldn\u2019t exist, and people whose productivity won\u2019t support a family shouldn\u2019t have jobs.This is curious. Many countries that set a minimum wage, including the U.S., also set subminimum wages for teenagers, trainees, probationary hires, certain categories of disabled persons, etc. Having both a minimum and subminimum is hard to reconcile logically: Low-paying jobs shouldn\u2019t exist, except some people need low-paying jobs, so they should exist. This concession to reality, in fact, shows not all minimum-wage advocates are economic scofflaws.SEIU signed off on the \u201cfight for $15\u201d as part of a convoluted scheme to bring unionization to McDonald\u2019s. As all would admit privately, the idea was always pie in the sky. But union leaders have to spend their members\u2019 dues on something, or members might get the idea they don\u2019t need to keep paying dues.Now SEIU\u2019s spending priorities have been changing again. Lately the leadership has arguably rediscovered its first love, electoral politics, not organizing. The union has let it be known that the \u201cfight for $15\u201d will be scaled back to free up funds to fight the 2018 congressional elections and 2020 presidential race. No doubt the Seattle study and all the attention it\u2019s getting in the media make the decision even easier.Appeared in the July 1, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-06-30 15:42:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/seattle-aims-at-mcdonalds-hits-workers-1498851733", "news_title": "Seattle Aims at McDonald\u2019s, Hits Workers", "keywords": "McDonald's,MCD,Service Employees International Union,labor,personnel,corporate,industrial news,workers pay,political,general news,general labor issues,minimum wage,commentaries,opinions,hotels,restaurants,cafes,fast food places,limited-service eating places,leisure,arts,hospitality"}, {"content": "The U.S. isn\u2019t the only North American nation busy celebrating its birthday. On July 1, 1867, the British North America Act took effect, establishing the Dominion of Canada. Today, my country has the world\u2019s second-largest land mass, its 10th-largest economy, and consistently high rankings in economic freedom and quality of life. But while Canada often punches above its weight, there\u2019s always been some frustration that it doesn\u2019t hold the title belt.\u201cCanada has been modest in its history,\u201d Prime Minister       Sir Wilfrid Laurier       said in 1904, \u201cbut its history, in my estimation, is only commencing. . . . The 19th century was the century of the United States. I think we can claim that it is Canada that shall fill the 20th century.\u201d Laurier was too optimistic: The 20th century also belonged to the U.S., and unless       Donald Trump       changes things dramatically, the 21st probably will, too.Fair enough. America became a global superpower, Canada a traditional middle power with more influence than most. Together, our two countries formed a political friendship and economic alliance that has stood the test of time, and we have more similarities than most care to admit.Yet our histories are exceedingly different. Canada wasn\u2019t born out of revolution and a desire to escape the shackles of monarchy. Canadians firmly believed in liberty and freedom, and still do, but never wanted a republic. Rather, we usually view our former colonial status as New France, and later British North America, in a respectful manner as a stage in our development.There have been occasional flare-ups, and fierce constitutional battles, between French-speaking Quebec and English-speaking Canada. These have led to terrorism, but not all-out civil war, and Quebec\u2019s separatism has been drowned out in recent decades.Meanwhile, Canada remains an independent country within the Commonwealth. The British Parliament was involved, directly and indirectly, in any changes to the Canadian Constitution until the Canada Act in 1982 ended that requirement. While Canada\u2019s history of responsible government goes back to 1848, it started using the Westminster model of representative democracy only in 1931.But Canada never slavishly followed its early territorial masters. The country always had an independent spirit and developed its own ideas and policies. Early prime ministers, such as       Sir John A. Macdonald       (Conservative) and Laurier (Liberal), worked to ensure that Canada had a seat and voice at the bargaining table.Canadians fought valiantly alongside the U.S. and other allies during the two world wars and Korea. True, the U.S. and Canada also fought each other in the War of 1812, but we needn\u2019t belabor that one.What can Canadians do differently to ensure that this century, or any century, belongs to us, too? A fine start would be to establish a proper break between progressive values and progressive politics.Canada has leaned left for most of its existence. It\u2019s more comfortable as a nanny state than a free-market champion. It prefers to jaw-jaw rather than war-war. It takes pride in leading the way, helping to shift popular opinion, on legal marijuana and same-sex marriage.This \u201ccertain boldness in social matters,\u201d the Economist observed in 2003, meant that \u201ca cautious case can be made that Canada is now rather cool.\u201d While progressive Canadians cheered this analysis, they must have been disappointed when the same magazine wrote a decade later that Conservative Prime Minister       Stephen Harper       had made their country \u201cdecidedly uncool.\u201dMr. Harper\u2019s government concentrated on supposedly lame things like lower taxes, smaller government, fiscal responsibility, trade liberalization, muscular foreign policy and stronger relations with the U.S. It earned respect for prudently handling the global economic crisis and for leaving the foreign-policy kiddie table to take a leadership role in world affairs.Canadian voters could handle this radical political change only for so long, however. They abandoned the Tory ship and gave the Liberals a mandate in 2015. Suddenly we were cool again.       Justin Trudeau,        our young, hip prime minister, has gradually reversed many of Mr. Harper\u2019s policy gains. He has returned Canada to its traditional role abroad as a peacekeeper, renewed his supporters\u2019 faith in social liberalism, and become the king of selfies.For the next 150 years and beyond, my hope is that Canada will reflect on its longstanding core principles, question them, and make the necessary improvements. That would mean reducing our state-centric approach to government, increasing the influence of free markets, and ensuring that individual rights and freedoms are properly defended and upheld by the constitution.Maybe then       Barack Obama\u2019s       statement to the Canadian Parliament last year\u2014\u201cthe world needs more Canada\u201d\u2014would be more than just a friendly sentiment. It would be closer to the world Laurier envisioned more than a century ago, and a nice birthday gift to boot.Mr. Taube, a Troy Media syndicated columnist and political commentator, was a speechwriter for Prime Minister Stephen Harper.", "news_time": "2017-06-30 15:41:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/at-150-canada-is-cool-but-can-aspire-to-something-more-1498851707", "news_title": "At 150, Canada Is \u2018Cool\u2019 but Can Aspire to Something More", "keywords": "united states,Canada,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,commentaries,opinions"}, {"content": "PhiladelphiaIf there\u2019s one thing Americans of all political stripes can agree on, it\u2019s that the country is divided\u2014bitterly, dangerously, perhaps irreconcilably riven. \u201cIt shows up in very cinematic fashion, in things like the Scalise shooting,\u201d says historian       Allen Guelzo.       \u201cSo we jump to the conclusion: Oh my goodness, does it mean we\u2019re on the brink of civil war?\u201dNo, answers Mr. Guelzo, director of the Civil War Era Studies Program at Gettysburg College. The Civil War was singular and is almost certain to remain so. But he does see continuities, some of them surprising, between then and now. And he thinks today\u2019s divisions are worse than those of any time in American history except the 1850s and \u201960s.Today \u201cthere are a lot of unhappy personalities, and there are divisions of cultural values,\u201d Mr. Guelzo tells me over dinner at the Union League of Philadelphia, where he\u2019s been a member since 1983. That was also true when the country was young, \u201cbetween Jefferson and Adams, and between Jefferson and Hamilton,\u201d and later with \u201call kinds of acidulous political and cultural divisions\u2014over Masons, Catholics,       John Calhoun,        nullification, tariffs, Andrew Jackson. You go down the list, and it\u2019s one thing after another. But it didn\u2019t drive us to civil war.\u201dWhat did was the combination of slavery and secession, \u201cand the two of them are really bound together.\u201d Both are \u201cvery absolute questions,\u201d Mr. Guelzo says. Lincoln\u2019s observation in 1858 that \u201cthis government cannot endure, permanently, half slave and half free\u201d was born of the failure of repeated efforts at compromise\u2014most recently the Supreme Court decision that made Chief Justice       Roger Taney       infamous.\u201cWhen Taney wrote       Dred Scott       in 1857, it wasn\u2019t because Taney was the most vile pro-slavery ideologue in the country,\u201d Mr. Guelzo says. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t\u2014I mean, the man had actually emancipated his own slaves. And while he certainly wasn\u2019t friendly to abolitionists, that\u2019s not why he wrote Dred Scott the way he did. He did it because the situation in 1857 seemed to have demonstrated that neither the legislative branch nor the executive branch was capable of arriving at a solution for the slavery question. So who steps up into the batter\u2019s box? The judiciary\u2014we will settle this.\u201dBut even slavery was not a sufficient condition for war. \u201cIf slavery had been legal in, let\u2019s say, Minnesota, Maine, Florida and Louisiana, there would never have been a Civil War,\u201d Mr. Guelzo says. What gave the question \u201cpolitical mass\u201d was geography: Slavery had been outlawed throughout the North by the early 19th century, leaving 15 states where it was legal. \u201cBecause these slave states were all contiguous, they could look at a map and see themselves as a political unit.\u201d Eleven did in 1860-61.\u201cDo we have that today?\u201d Mr. Guelzo asks. \u201cNo. I mean, you have California talking about seceding. But then again, California talks about all kinds of crazy things.\u201dAmericans on both sides look across the political divide and see crazy people espousing destructive ideas. From his historian\u2019s vantage point, Mr. Guelzo sees something deeply durable. \u201cIf you look at Democrats and Republicans since the middle of the 19th century,\u201d he says, \u201cthe political culture of the parties has not changed all that much.\u201d Their policies may be drastically different, but \u201cthat\u2019s the tip of the iceberg. What you want to look at, as far as historical continuity, is the seven-eighths of the iceberg below the water.\u201dHe pulls out a small notebook in which he has drawn a comparative chart listing seven \u201ccultural components\u201d of each 19th-century party. Democrats\u2019 orientation, he says, has changed in only two of them: They used to tend toward \u201cagrarian\u201d occupations and \u201cpatriarchal\u201d families, both anachronisms now. Republicans, though, still favor \u201ccommercial\u201d work and \u201ccompanionate\u201d marriage.The other components pairs do seem continuous for both parties, as Mr. Guelzo says. Morals: Democrats, \u201cindividual\u201d; Republicans, \u201ccollective.\u201d Economic system: Democrats, \u201cstatic\u201d; Republicans, \u201cdynamic.\u201d Philosophy: Democrats, \u201cRomantic\u201d; Republicans, \u201cEnlightenment.\u201dThis cultural taxonomy predates the GOP\u2019s founding in 1854. Mr. Guelzo credits fellow historian       Daniel Walker Howe       with inspiring the chart by observing, in \u201cThe Political Culture of the American Whigs\u201d (1979), that \u201cthe Whigs proposed a society that would be economically diverse but culturally uniform; the Democrats preferred the economic uniformity of a society of small farmers and artisans but were more tolerant of cultural and moral diversity.\u201dTwo of Mr. Guelzo\u2019s components seem especially salient today. The first is political style, a cousin of philosophy: \u201cDemocrats love passion, Republicans love reason.\u201d He cites Lincoln\u2019s debates with       Stephen Douglas      : \u201cWith Douglas, it was always a big show, and if you listened to Douglas for five minutes, you were captured by him.\u201d By contrast, \u201cLincoln is as reasonable as a Vulcan with Asperger\u2019s,\u201d Mr. Guelzo says. \u201cIf you listened to him for five minutes, you weren\u2019t impressed. If you listened to him for 25 minutes, he had you, because you couldn\u2019t argue. He had done all the work.\u201dWhen I observe that President Trump doesn\u2019t quite fit this mold, Mr. Guelzo acknowledges the point. \u201cThen again,\u201d he says, \u201che\u2019s not been a Republican all of his life, now has he?\u201d Mr. Guelzo\u2019s theory would explain why many conservative Republicans found it harder to stomach Mr. Trump than       Mitt Romney,        notwithstanding Mr. Romney\u2019s ideological heterodoxies, and why Mr. Trump had crossover appeal to traditionally Democratic voters.The second salient component is what Mr. Guelzo calls a party\u2019s \u201cpolitical center.\u201d For Democrats, it is \u201clocal\u201d; for Republicans, \u201cnational.\u201d At first glance, this seems like a discontinuity: In recent decades the GOP has been the party of states\u2019 rights, while the Democrats have sought to centralize power in Washington.But Mr. Guelzo isn\u2019t talking about policy. His argument is that Republicans think of themselves as Americans first, whereas today Democratic localism takes the form of subnational identity politics. \u201cA sense of belonging to an American nation is much more attenuated,\u201d he says. \u201cDo you identify yourself as being a woman, transgender, black, Latino\u2014you go down the list\u2014or do you identify yourself as an American? That has actually now become an issue. This would have been unthinkable two generations ago.\u201dIt is in this regard that Mr. Guelzo thinks the divisions of the current era are the second-worst in American history: \u201cThe Civil War is really the only other time I can find where people are willing to sacrifice\u2014completely sacrifice\u2014national identity for local.\u201dAs an example of the decline in national solidarity, Mr. Guelzo cites       Nancy Pelosi\u2019s       and       Harry Reid\u2019s       public assertions\u2014as leaders of congressional majorities during the later Bush administration\u2014that the Iraq war was a failure. No political leader would have said such a thing during World War II. Even in World War I, which was much more contentious, \u201cthe United States wasn\u2019t the issue. The question was: Are we looking at a casus belli being provided by Germany?\u201d he says. \u201cFor Pelosi and Reid, who said that while the war was in progress\u2014to announce while things are still going on, while they\u2019re still shooting\u2014that is simply unimaginable, and yet there they were. And they were doing it not because they really had a lot of military expertise. They were doing it to score political points.\u201dWasn\u2019t there a precedent in the Vietnam era? No, Mr. Guelzo says, at least not in Congress: \u201cYou didn\u2019t see       Mike Mansfield      \u201d\u2014the Senate majority leader and a critic of the war\u2014\u201cdo that kind of thing during Vietnam.\u201dBut the Civil War era was far worse. In the 1850s, \u201cyou had brawls on the floor of the House of Representatives. One of the most precious ones was when       William Barksdale       from Mississippi got into a flying fistfight with a Northern representative, and one of them reached out to grab him by the hair and pulled off his wig.\u201d That was in 1858.The story reminds me of this year\u2019s riot at Middlebury College, and that\u2019s what Mr. Guelzo has in mind. Colleges, he says, \u201chave become the stages on which violence has been acted out.\u201d He describes today\u2019s social-justice warriors as \u201cideological lynch mobs\u201d and pointedly compares them to the real thing. \u201cThe people who always wanted to silence others, always wanted to have the lynchings, were the pro-slavery people,\u201d he says. \u201cIt surprises my students, as it should, that Southern postmasters were given free rein to censor the mails coming into Southern post offices. They could take material that might be suspected of being abolitionist in nature; they were allowed to destroy it\u2014because you didn\u2019t want a slave who might turn out to be literate to read any of that, now did you?\u201dBut the comparison goes only so far. The violence \u201cdoesn\u2019t make things happy for us in the universities, believe me,\u201d Mr. Guelzo says. Still, \u201cit\u2019s better than happening in Congress.\u201d Further, campus mobs are a far cry from an army, and their selection of enemies betrays a certain incoherence\u2014one day a libertarian conservative like       Charles Murray,        another a leftist like Evergreen State College\u2019s       Bret Weinstein.Which brings us back to the central premise of Mr. Guelzo\u2019s assurance that America is nowhere near a civil war. \u201cThere is a lot of contention about culture; there\u2019s a lot of contention about politicians and individuals. But there\u2019s no flaming, absolute issue that draws people out of themselves\u2014which is to say, draws them out of responsibility to each other\u2014and pits them at each other\u2019s throats.\u201dIn the 1980s, he says, he wondered \u201cwhether abortion was going to constitute an issue like that, because there\u2019s no way you can be mildly for or mildly against\u2014you\u2019re either for it or against it.\u201d But he concluded it probably wouldn\u2019t happen, because abortion lacked the \u201csectional identity\u201d of slavery circa 1860.Thus another counterfactual: \u201cIf you had, let\u2019s say, 21 contiguous states in the union where abortion was legal and 29 where it is illegal, then suddenly you have created a political standoff, and people will start to think in terms of us versus them, rather than the nation,\u201d he says. \u201cYou just do not have that in the atmosphere right now.\u201dAbortion laws did vary by state before 1973, when the Supreme Court imposed a nationwide regime of legalization. But pro- and antiabortion states \u201chadn\u2019t begun to conceptualize themselves that way,\u201d Mr. Guelzo notes, before Roe v. Wade elevated the question into a national one. Today it\u2019s not hard to imagine what Mr. Guelzo\u2019s scenario of a country divided over abortion might look like\u2014see the 2004 or 2016 election map.When the high court effectively upheld Roe 25 years ago, in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, a three-justice plurality proclaimed that the 1973 ruling carries \u201crare precedential force\u201d because it \u201ccalls the contending sides of a national controversy to end their national division by accepting a common mandate rooted in the Constitution.\u201d The three justices claimed this was something the court had done only once before \u201cin our lifetime,\u201d in Brown v. Board of Education.But it sounds very much like what Mr. Guelzo thinks Chief Justice Taney was attempting in Dred Scott. The question arises: Did Justices       Sandra Day O\u2019Connor,       Anthony Kennedy       and       David Souter       succeed where Taney had failed\u2014if not in uniting the country, at least in keeping the peace?Maybe so, Mr. Guelzo answers with a hint of reluctance: \u201cBy getting it out of the states, it\u2019s removed an opportunity for it to become that kind of sectional issue. I\u2019m not saying that as a fan of Roe v. Wade, but at least we haven\u2019t gone to war over it. And given the absolutism of the issue, it had plenty of combustibility for that. Still does.\u201dMr. Taranto is the Journal\u2019s editorial features editor.", "news_time": "2017-06-30 15:40:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/divided-america-standsthen-and-now-1498851654", "news_title": "Divided America Stands\u2014Then, and Now", "keywords": "abraham lincoln,slavery,the civil war,Allen Guelzo,abortion,political,general news,society,community,ethical issues,health,social issues,medical treatments,procedures,commentaries,opinions,interviews"}, {"content": "President       Donald Trump       signed an executive order Friday reinstating the National Space Council\u2014a panel to be led by Vice President       Mike Pence      \u2014as part of an effort to establish closer coordination among civilian, military and budding commercial activities.Mr. Trump said the move \u201csends a clear signal to the world that we are restoring America\u2019s proud legacy of leadership in space.\u201d Without disclosing any specifics, Mr. Trump said \u201cwe\u2019re going to lead again,\u201d pursuing what he called \u201cthe next great American frontier.\u201dFriday\u2019s announcement, long anticipated by lawmakers and industry officials, was decided before the GOP president was sworn in, according to people familiar with the details. The goals include speeding up big-ticket government space programs, while leveraging commercial projects to streamline federal efforts and reduce taxpayer costs.The administration has yet to pick nominees for other important positions involving space, including the head of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.The priorities detailed in Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order include developing long-range goals and strategies for space and fostering \u201cclose coordination, cooperation and technology and information exchange\u201d between various space sectors. Under the order, federal departments and agencies must conform to policies established by the council.Mark Albrecht, the council\u2019s last executive secretary before the panel effectively ceased operations in 1993, helped establish the framework for the new group.Mr. Albrecht said Friday that the order \u201cprovides all the necessary authorities\u201d to address every component of space\u2014from civil to commercial to national security operations\u2014\u201cseparately and as an integrated whole.\u201dThe council\u2019s \u201cagenda will be substantial and urgent,\u201d ranging from rationalizing launch options \u201cto fully integrating new privatized and commercial space capabilities\u201d into an overarching national space policy, Mr. Albrecht said.The council will be comprised of a handful of cabinet members, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the director of national intelligence and other senior White House aides.Initially, the president\u2019s executive order was supposed to be accompanied by some personnel decisions. Still, the anticipated move will provide top-level oversight of government space initiatives\u2014spanning both manned and unmanned programs\u2014while providing a single coordination point for matching priorities between NASA\u2019s more than $19 billion annual budget and the Pentagon\u2019s larger overall spending blueprint.Many national-security spy satellites, experimental spacecraft and other space projects are highly classified and their budgets aren\u2019t public.Earlier incarnations of the council stretched back to the height of the U.S.-Russian space race of the 1960s, while the last version was in place more than two decades ago during former President George H.W. Bush\u2019s tenure in the White House.One of the council\u2019s primary missions is expected to be dealing with the bureaucratic logjam that has resulted in what many lawmakers and even Pentagon brass acknowledge are overly expensive launches of national-security satellites. NASA and the Pentagon currently are following independent plans to build next-generation launchers, and critics contend there hasn\u2019t been enough effort to identify potential cost saving through closer cooperation.In addition, the budding commercial space industry offers new opportunities for the government to reduce launch costs and eventually replace some existing spy satellites with smaller, much less expensive versions.Formation of the council as a formal focus for such deliberations also comes at a time that the White House and the Pentagon are formulating plans to step up protection of U.S. space assets. Officials are working to devise new hardware, warfighting doctrine and organizational structures in response to aggressive moves by Russia, China and other nations challenging American supremacy in orbit.Mr., Albrecht said the council will consider ways to deploy \u201cnew and dominant space deterrence and warfighting capabilities\u201d in light of the increasingly contested environment of space. Pentagon officials recently have stressed the importance of stepping up U.S. offensive capabilities in space, and lawmakers already have committed to increase budgets for that.For NASA, closer White House scrutiny could mean hard decisions to abandon some current programs to fit projected spending within likely flat budget ceilings in coming years.Absence of a NASA chief has hobbled efforts to revise agency priorities, and the signing ceremony itself reflected White House efforts to demonstrate that the council intends to look more broadly than manned exploration. None of NASA\u2019s senior career officials attended the ceremony.Despite a flurry of early interest by senior White House aides in changing civilian space policy, so far the administration has avoided major new programs and generally has maintained a status quo budget for NASA.Early on, White House aides expressed interest in melding commercial efforts with NASA\u2019s manned space exploration programs, but there has been scant movement in that direction.Write to Andy Pasztor at andy.pasztor@wsj.comAppeared in the July 1, 2017, print edition as 'President Reinstates Space Council.'", "news_time": "2017-06-30 15:39:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/white-house-set-to-unveil-high-level-council-for-coordinating-space-policy-1498848039", "news_title": "White House Unveils High-Level Council for Coordinating Space Policy", "keywords": "council,nasa,national space council,pentagon,policy,satellites,space,National Aeronautics and Space Administration,Donald Trump,government finance,government budget,taxation,sub-national,local budget,economic news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,sciences,humanities,space exploration,travel,technology"}, {"content": "BRAS\u00cdLIA\u2014Brazil\u2019s Supreme Court said on Friday it will permit Senator       A\u00e9cio Neves       to resume legislative work, after the lawmaker was suspended by the same court for more than a month following corruption allegations.Justice       Marco Aur\u00e9lio Mello       ruled unconstitutional the action against Mr. Neves, one of Brazil\u2019s top politicians and key ally to President       Michel Temer.\u201cThe suspension by injunction\u2026is unacceptable,\u201d Mr. Mello wrote, adding that only the Senate itself can make that decision. \u201cThe judiciary mustn\u2019t replace the legislative.\u201dBrazil\u2019s constitution allows the suspension of lawmakers by the judiciary branch only in very specific circumstances\u2014such as when they are caught in the act of committing a crime\u2014none of which was present in Mr. Neves\u2019 case, according to Mr. Mello.Mr. Neves is accused by Attorney General Rodrigo Janot of accepting about $604,000 in bribes from Joesley Batista, the former chairman of Brazilian meatpacking giant         JBS SA      . The senator was also accused of trying to obstruct the sprawling graft investigation known as Operation Car Wash, which has ensnared business executives, lawmakers and former presidents.Mr. Neves\u2019 has denied wrongdoing.The accusations stem from Mr. Batista\u2019s plea deal with the Car Wash prosecutors, in which the businessman said he paid bribes to hundreds of politicians in exchange for special treatment by government agencies.Shortly after Mr. Batista\u2019s allegations surfaced, Mr. Neves was banned from casting a vote in the Senate or participating in hearings. The decision was made by another justice, Edson Fachin, who is in charge of initial decisions on cases related to the Car Wash probe.The senator\u2019s case has since been transferred to Mr. Mello.The Supreme Court still has to decide whether or not to accept charges filed by Mr. Janot against Mr. Neves, because a sitting federal lawmaker can only be tried by the high court.A spokeswoman for Mr. Janot\u2019s office had no comment.Mr. Neves\u2019 lawyer       Alberto Toron       said Friday\u2019s ruling repairs a \u201cflagrant illegality\u201d and \u201creaffirms the independence of powers.\u201dWrite to Paulo Trevisani at paulo.trevisani@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-30 15:29:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/brazil-supreme-court-allows-senator-to-resume-work-1498850981", "news_title": "Brazil Supreme Court Allows Senator to Resume Work ", "keywords": "aecio neves, brazil, brazil car wash probe, brazil corruption probe, brazil senator aecio neves, jbs, joesley batista, marcio aurelio mello, operation car wash, rodrigo janot,JBS SA ,JBSS3.BR,Michel Temer,A\u00e9cio Neves,Marco Aur\u00e9lio Mello,corporate crime,legal action,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,corruption,crime,financial crime,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,judicial branch,food,beverages,tobacco,animal slaughtering,processing,meat processing,consumer goods,food products"}, {"content": "The Senate still hasn\u2019t voted on ObamaCare reform, U.S. workers are still waiting for tax cuts to drive economic growth and President of the United States Donald Trump is trading insults with the co-hosts of an MSNBC talk show. Yet Mr. Trump appears to be making progress in what might have seemed the most difficult task given to him by voters in 2016: reducing the power of Washington\u2019s permanent bureaucracy.Secretary of State       Rex Tillerson       wasn\u2019t exactly dying to move to Washington to run a federal department, but he seems to have warmed to the task. Max Bergmann, a former Obama Administration official now at the leftist Center for American Progress, writes in Politico that the \u201cdeconstruction of the State Department is well underway.\u201d Discounting for the usual Beltway hyperbole, this probably isn\u2019t as good as it sounds.All kidding aside, the State Department is one federal agency that was actually contemplated by America\u2019s founders. Conducting foreign policy is an important and necessary task for our central government. But like so much of the Beltway bureaucracy State has been overfunded and undermanaged for years. Now, despite what you may have read about untouchable bureaucrats unaccountable to the public they are supposed to serve, Mr. Tillerson has found ways to clean house, at least according to Mr. Bergmann:The former Obama appointee is apparently so unnerved by the Trump-Tillerson era at State that he lets slip the fact that the career staff didn\u2019t think much of the previous management either, and that the conservative critique of the department is at least partly true:Do taxpayers dare to dream? As odd as this sounds for regular observers of the federal leviathan, the new boss seems to be imposing the kind of tough measures often seen at struggling companies, but almost never witnessed at government departments that have lost their way:Perhaps the Tillerson method could work at other agencies too. Mr. Bergmann for his part seems to be disappointed that the un-elected career staff has not been able to impose its will on the duly-elected political leadership:Here\u2019s to making the will of voters more than just a distant concern-- and highly relevant to the work of federal agencies.Meanwhile over at the Environmental Protection Agency, new boss Scott Pruitt is not just draining the bureaucratic swamp in Washington, he\u2019s taking away the agency\u2019s power to oversee swamps nationwide.

FB 0.79%       and other tech companies, which advocate self-regulation to tackle those problems.\u00a0That step followed the \u20ac2.42 billion ($2.76 billion) fine that the European Union\u2019s executive arm levied this week against             Alphabet Inc.\u2019s        GOOGL 0.59%       Google for abusing its dominance as a search engine.These decisions have significant implications for the companies in Europe, one of their most important markets with its 500 million consumers. The rulings also influence regulators, courts and officials globally. This week, South Korea\u2019s antitrust chief told the Yonhap News agency he will examine how to curb the market clout of Google and Facebook.Google said it \u201crespectfully disagrees\u201d with the EU decision and will consider an appeal, and didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment on South Korea\u2019s plans. Facebook declined to comment.Some of these issues are coming to a head in the U.S., too, though at a slower place. American policy makers in some cases are rethinking policies that were designed to nurture the tech industry in its early days, now that these companies are touching every sector of the economy.The companies also are coming to terms with the loss of a strong ally in the White House in former President Barack Obama. When Republicans took charge in January, GOP lawmakers set out to roll back several big Obama-era policies that favored tech companies. That included the \u201cnet neutrality\u201d regulations that prevented broadband providers from prioritizing certain internet content, and recent privacy rules that hit telecom companies but not tech firms.Up to now, though, the U.S. generally has favored a lighter approach, driven partly by Americans\u2019 aversion to restrictions on free speech. Across the Atlantic, the more tightly controlled approach is illustrated by Europeans\u2019 war-hardened devotion to personal privacy and restricting hate speech.\u201cIt stems from very different economic traditions in how much of a role the state should have in resolving problems,\u201d says James Waterworth, vice president for Europe at the U.S.-based Computer & Communications Industry Association, a lobby group that represents U.S. tech companies including Facebook and Google. \u201cIn a globalized world, with large transnational companies, these things increasingly come into conflict.\u201dSome free-market supporters in the U.S. and Europe view the moves by regulators as cover for political interventions and even protectionism. Europe dominated the early mobile-phone era but now has no tech companies on the scale of Google or Facebook.Mr. Obama in 2015 said the EU\u2019s investigations into big U.S. tech companies were \u201cmore commercially driven than anything else,\u201d suggesting the EU was trying to help out European competitors.EU officials deny such accusations but frequently say that if large tech companies, which are primarily American, want access to the bloc, they must \u201cplay by the EU\u2019s rules.\u201dThe EU\u2019s antitrust watchdog is still investigating other aspects of Google\u2019s business and chip maker             Qualcomm Inc.       for allegedly abusing their market positions. The watchdog also has been probing whether             Amazon.com Inc.       paid appropriate taxes in Luxembourg. The companies all deny wrongdoing.Meanwhile, the EU is considering proposing more rules for internet platforms to prevent them from offering unfair terms to small businesses that use their services to sell or promote products.And Europe\u2019s national privacy regulators\u2014who next May will get the power to issue fat fines for privacy-rule violations\u2014are coordinating multiple investigations into Facebook\u2019s handling of personal information from chat service WhatsApp.\u201cThese companies have become so dominant, so powerful, when [they] demote rivals, who puts the limit?\u201d said       Ramon Tremosa i Balcells,        a liberal lawmaker from Spain who backed the European Parliament\u2019s resolution in 2014 calling for a breakup of Google.Regulatory scrutiny in the U.S. may never match that of Europe, but some American politicians have raised concerns about the size of tech companies and their power in the market. President       Donald Trump\u2019s       nominee to be the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust chief, Makan Delrahim, has promised to \u201cinvestigate and vigorously enforce the antitrust laws with respect to online platforms.\u201dOne factor in the policing has been tech firms\u2019 disruption of traditional industrial giants in Europe. In response, many legacy players have lobbied for new rules and tougher enforcement against the interlopers\u2014and found open ears. European telecom firms, angry about seeing their revenue from text messages undercut by chat apps, were among the first to advocate new legislation to mandate a \u201clevel playing field.\u201dMore recently, European car makers have lobbied EU officials to support industry proposals that car makers should be the primary gateway for drivers to share car data. Some executives fear Silicon Valley firms could hoard vehicle data, turning cars into low-margin devices like many mobile phones, one auto executive said. German publishers also lobbied for copyright proposals that would help them seek remuneration from Google and other news aggregators for snippets of articles used on their websites.News Corp,       owner of The Wall Street Journal, has formally complained to the EU about Google\u2019s handling of news articles in search results.\u201cThe revenues generated by creators, performers and those that invest in creative content are accruing disproportionately to a few large players who themselves do not engage in content creation,\u201d G\u00fcnther Oettinger, the EU\u2019s German commissioner and former digital chief, said in November, defending the commission\u2019s proposed new copyright rules.\u2014Eun-Young Jeong in Seoul contributed to this article.Write to Sam Schechner at sam.schechner@wsj.com, Natalia Drozdiak at natalia.drozdiak@wsj.com and John D.

The State Department reiterated its call for Mr. Holt\u2019s immediate release, saying there were \u201cserious doubts about the merits and lawfulness of his detention.\u201dVenezuelan officials, who frequently accuse the U.S. of orchestrating antigovernment plots without offering evidence, have said state security officers\u00a0found weapons in Mr. Holt\u2019s apartment and linked him to armed groups allegedly seeking to overthrow the government. Mr. Holt and his wife, though, have never been formally charged or given a hearing. Neighbors told Mr. Holt\u2019s family the weapons were planted.\u201cHe\u2019s an innocent person detained arbitrarily and his only crime is being a US. citizen,\u201d said       Marino Alvarado,        a rights lawyer in Caracas.

The effort is looking at whether managers show a preference for their personal accounts or some clients over others when they allocate hot shares, the person added.Hedge-fund advisers owe a legal duty to clients to act in their investors\u2019 best interest, so managers could run afoul of U.S. rules if they don\u2019t disclose preferential treatment they grant to themselves or particular clients over other customers.SEC scrutiny of how managers allocate profitable trades isn\u2019t new. The commission, which won broad authority to supervise hedge and private-equity funds through the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, detected in 2012 and 2013 that some managers allocate \u201cprofitable trades and investment opportunities to proprietary funds rather than client accounts in contravention of existing policies and procedures,\u201d former SEC Chairman       Mary Jo White       said in an October 2015 speech.In December, a California-based investment adviser,       Larry Phillips,        agreed to be banned from the money-management industry to settle SEC claims that he unfairly allocated profitable stock and options trades\u2014a practice known as cherry-picking\u2014to at least four favored clients. Mr. Phillips\u2019 firm, TPG Advisors LLC, managed $220 million for 280 clients before the SEC sued him and the firm, according to filings in the administrative court case.The SEC\u2019s hedge-fund inspections in 2012 and 2013 looked at over 180 hedge-fund firms and found a range of other deficiencies, including evidence that some funds changed how they valued assets in order to boost their value.It couldn\u2019t be immediately learned which hedge funds received the letters or how many firms were targeted.An SEC spokesman declined to comment. News of the exams was first reported by Bloomberg.The allocation of in-demand IPOs has long been a source of abuse and even misconduct on Wall Street. Investment managers jockey to buy the shares at the initial sale, often because the price pops higher on the first day of trading, creating a quick and easy profit.             Goldman Sachs Group Inc.       and             Morgan Stanley                   paid $40 million each in 2005 to settle SEC claims that they improperly tied allocations of IPO shares to promises by customers to buy additional shares once trading began.Write to Dave Michaels at dave.michaels@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-30 14:09:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-inspecting-how-hedge-funds-dole-out-hot-ipo-shares-among-clients-1498846175", "news_title": "SEC Inspecting How Hedge Funds Dole Out Hot IPO Shares Among Clients", "keywords": "hedge funds, ipo allocation, preferred clients,Securities and Exchange Commission,corporate changes,regulation,government policy,stock listings,corporate funding,share capital,initial public offerings,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,trusts,funds,financial vehicles,alternative investments,financial services,investing,securities"}, {"content": "In 1880, when       Eastman Johnson       completed what is arguably his greatest painting, \u201cThe Cranberry Harvest, Island of Nantucket,\u201d he was already one of the best-known American artists of his era. His renown hinged on paintings that told stories. This one was less concerned with narrative: The people in the picture were simply gathering a favorite local fruit. And while work is work, the painting presents it as a kind of pleasurable communal activity. The light falls on many of them, and what radiant light it is. Johnson was a master at evoking the way it slants across a scene, selecting people and objects and leaving others in lush shadows.There are 40-plus figures in this painting, which is in the small but stellar permanent collection of the Timken Museum of Art in San Diego. The few detractors of this canvas, when it was first exhibited in New York at the National Academy of Design in 1880, thought their arrangement was too random. That isn\u2019t the case, but the structure is subtle. The central standing figure, a woman with illuminated bonnet, is echoed by other vertical forms: a crude sign at the far left that contains the word \u201ccranberry\u201d and a child at the far right. The figures, as an ensemble, form loose diagonals that lure the eye into the distance; there, a church steeple, a windmill and a lighthouse (additional horizontals) ultimately carry us to the town and bay. (Johnson thought the windmill was such an important emblem of Nantucket\u2019s colonial past that he moved it from another spot on the island into this vista.)Few paintings, in the 19th or any other century, blend figure and landscape as well as this one.       Thomas Eakins       and       Winslow Homer       were greater American realists, but \u201cThe Cranberry Harvest\u201d compares favorably to their best paintings.\u201cThe Cranberry Harvest\u201d is a paean to rusticity and agrarian life at a time when the U.S. was industrializing at a dizzying pace and when wealth was being amassed at an equal clip. You wouldn\u2019t know it, looking at this painting, but anxiety about the future of America was high.       Mark Twain       and       Charles Dudley Warner       famously dubbed this period the Gilded Age, in their novel by the same name, for the precipitous increase in wealth and rising political corruption they witnessed in the 1870s.These social realities only made the painting appealing to Eastman\u2019s contemporaries. But more crucially, for its longer life as a painting, the image he ultimately created, which was the outgrowth of several studies, is one of the most beautifully realized and compelling visions of community life in art history. Not because Johnson is making a visual statement, as in his famous Civil War era picture \u201cThe Wounded Drummer Boy,\u201d which extolled the heroism of the Union cause. Quite the contrary. In \u201cThe Cranberry Harvest\u201d he isn\u2019t preaching the virtues of an agricultural life; he is simply presenting people going about their seasonal ritual of harvesting cranberries.Johnson, who spent part of each year on Nantucket, lingered longer than usual in 1880 before returning to New York. He surely thought he was onto something with \u201cThe Cranberry Harvest.\u201d \u201cI am staying here to get through with things begun,\u201d he wrote to his friend and fellow painter       Jervis McEntee       on Dec. 13, 1879, \u201c\u2026 the models are here and whatever material I require, and that is all there is of the pictures, so I can\u2019t do them elsewhere.\u201dHe had always had a dazzling command of the figure, going back to the 1850s. But when Johnson turned his attention to paintings populated by multiple figures, he invariably created a tidy narrative for them, whether it be Bible reading, riding the stagecoach or a domestic moment. These paintings, though beautifully executed, feel tightly controlled by their stories and bound to their historical moment. Not so \u201cThe Cranberry Harvest.\u201d It depicts a moment in time, as if frozen in place; in the process he makes that moment feel larger than life, a poetic distillation of it.This conceit of a frozen moment needs for the figures to look utterly natural, and they do. And the subject of the picture is humble, its sweep impressive. The effect is akin to a symphony in which the melody is richly textured with orchestration. And as with a symphony, in which you listen repeatedly and find different details, many viewings of the picture reveal different facets. At the far left are children in conversation about something off stage. At center is a man who has brought a chair with him, working at a leisurely pace. At the far right, people load the harvest into a wagon.The two great qualities in Johnson\u2019s art\u2014his mastery of figure and light\u2014coupled with his gift for landscape painting, found their meeting ground in \u201cThe Cranberry Harvest,\u201d yielding a panorama that depicts people in harmony with nature. Nineteenth-century thought and aesthetics were animated by a search for this harmony, and Johnson found a way to present it profoundly but unpretentiously.\u2014Mr. Pincus is the author of \u201cOn a Scale That Competes With the World: The Art of Edward and       Nancy Reddin       Kienholz\u201d (California).", "news_time": "2017-06-30 14:04:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-paean-to-rusticity-and-agrarian-life-1498845857", "news_title": "A Paean to Rusticity and Agrarian Life", "keywords": "arts in review, eastman johnson, island of nantucket,masterpiece, painting, the cranberry harvest,art,political,general news,arts,entertainment,commentaries,opinions"}, {"content": "The Labor Department said it is seeking more public feedback on the fiduciary rule, a sign that the retirement-savings regulation could still be revised before it takes full effect.The heart of the fiduciary rule, which requires stewards of some $3 trillion in retirement assets to act in clients\u2019 best interest, began to take effect June 9 after a two-month delay. The final compliance deadline is currently January 1.In a notice published Friday, the Labor Department said it would reopen the comment period to solicit feedback from investors, advisers and businesses. The agency is specifically asking for input that could form the basis of changes and new exemptions to the fiduciary rule. It will accept such comments for 30 days, and will also seek feedback for 15 days on whether to postpone the January 1 deadline.Despite expectations by opponents that the Trump administration would scrap the rule, it has survived thus far. Labor Secretary       Alexander Acosta,        in an opinion piece for The Wall Street Journal last month, said \u201crespect for the rule of law\u201d precluded a further delay of the June 9 deadline.However, Mr. Acosta didn\u2019t eliminate the possibility of a repeal or revision after the Labor Department completes an economic-impact review at the end of the year. The reopening of the comment period is part of that process.In its notice Friday, the agency listed specific questions for which it seeks input. In addition to asking whether a delay in the January compliance deadline would ease industry burdens, the Labor Department has asked what firms have already done to comply with the regulation, how an altered or eliminated best-interest contract would affect advisers and firms, and how certain aspects of compliance could be simplified and potentially streamlined if the Securities and Exchange Commission updates its own standard of conduct for investment advisers.The feedback the agency receives could help the administration make the legal case for a further delay in the regulation\u2019s final compliance deadline, said       Erin Sweeney,        an attorney at Miller & Chevalier Chartered who represents parties in litigation regarding fiduciary obligations.Ms. Sweeney also said it could help shape the final look of the rule. For example, she said the notice Friday suggests the department is considering eliminating the best-interest contract, which brokers would have to have clients sign starting January 1.

They are encouraged by cheap financing and rising equity markets.\u201cInvestors like\u00a0M&A\u00a0at the moment because it\u2019s an alternative to organic growth,\u201d for companies that face weak demand from their existing business or technological disruption,\u00a0said       Dietrich Becker,        a senior investment banker at Perella Weinberg Partners. \u201cThat\u2019s an overriding theme [and] that\u2019s something that\u2019s going to continue to drive people\u2019s agendas.\u201dAnd if European companies don\u2019t seize the initiative to act, activist investors are showing signs of impatience.             Nestl\u00e9 SA       faces such a scenario in the form of U.S. hedge fund Third Point LLC, which disclosed on\u00a0Sunday\u00a0that it bought a 1.25% stake in the\u00a0packaged-foods giant for $3.5 billion and urged changes to help boost the company\u2019s stock price.Several large deals announced this year have set the pace for the rest of 2017.Among them             Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.\u2019s       $5.2 billion deal to acquire Patheon NV, a Dutch-based drug development technology company, and the \u20ac16.3 billion ($18.5 billion) bid that same month by Italian infrastructure group             Atlantia                   SpA for Spanish rival Abertis Infraestructuras SA.As other big deals are completed\u2014such as the $49 billion merger between             Luxottica Group                   SpA and             Essilor International SA       in January\u2014bankers expect a raft of smaller deals to take their place.\u201cWe are going to see more smaller-scale deals\u201d for the rest of the year, said       Wilhelm Schulz,             Citigroup\u2019s       chairman of\u00a0M&A\u00a0for Europe, Middle East and Africa.Experts don't expect the activity to be led by China. Chinese deal-making into Europe, last year a key driver of activity, remained muted in the first half of 2017 due to Beijing\u2019s restrictions on capital outflows.In another potential setback, China\u2019s banking regulator recently initiated a review of the borrowing activity of some of the country\u2019s more acquisitive conglomerates, including Anbang Insurance Group Co., HNA Group Co. and             Fosun International Ltd.However, the country\u2019s global ambitions remain. China Investment Corp. in June agreed to buy             Blackstone Group                   LP\u2019s European warehouse business for \u20ac12.25 billion. China\u2019s Fortune Fountain Capital, meanwhile, recently agreed to acquire 90% of Baccarat from a group of private-equity firms for \u20ac164 million, aiming to accelerate the French luxury crystal maker\u2019s expansion plans in Asia and the Middle East.\u201cThere\u2019s ample rationale for, and evidence that, Chinese groups will continue to make acquisitions in Europe and elsewhere in the West,\u201d said Thierry d\u2019Argent, global co-head of coverage and investment banking at             Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale.The trend in rising mergers and acquisitions is also underpinned by the confidence CEOs are feeling from the availability of cheap financing and strengthening equity markets, some bankers say.Interest rates in Europe remain near record lows, continuing to benefit from central-bank efforts to stimulate economic growth in part through bond-buying programs.Assets held by the European Central Bank on its balance sheet total \u20ac4.2 trillion, almost double the amount at the start of 2015. At the same time, volatility in European equities as measured by the VSTOXX index is near a record low, while the broad-based Stoxx Europe 600 index is up 5% so far this year.That is all bolstered by signs of a more favorable business environment in Europe following the election of in May of       Emmanuel Macron       as France\u2019s new president, some bankers say. That win and the majority\u00a0that French voters handed Mr. Macron\u2019s party and its centrist ally in parliamentary elections this month is expected to make it easier to push through rule changes such as making it easier for businesses to fire people.Appeared in the July 3, 2017, print edition as 'Overseas Deal Making Stays Brisk.'", "news_time": "2017-06-30 13:39:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/european-deal-making-set-to-rise-despite-political-uncertainty-1498728602", "news_title": "European Deal Making Set to Rise Despite Political Uncertainty", "keywords": "2q market report,brexit, m&a,European Union,Nestle,Third Point,Thermo Fisher Scientific,TMO,Patheon N.V.,PTHN,Atlantia S.p.A.,IT:ATL,Abertis Infraestructuras S.A.,ES:ABE,Wilhelm Schulz,Dietrich Becker,Thierry d'Argent,ownership changes,acquisitions,mergers,divestments,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,elections,national,presidential elections,food,beverages,tobacco,banking,trusts,funds,financial vehicles,financial investments,investment banking,alternative investments,credit,consumer goods,financial services,food products,hedge funds,investing,securities"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014The U.S. Senate is considering banning the military from using commercial software developed by a prominent cybersecurity firm, citing concerns about the Moscow-based company\u2019s alleged ties to the Russian government.A military funding bill released this week contains a provision that would prohibit the Department of Defense from using Kaspersky Lab software \u201cdue to reports that the company might be vulnerable to Russian government influence,\u201d according to a summary of the legislation prepared by the Senate Armed Services Committee.Kaspersky Lab, a global cybersecurity firm founded by Russian businessman and computer expert Eugene Kaspersky, has long denied it has ties to any government, and Mr. Kaspersky has offered to testify in front of the U.S. Senate about the integrity of his company\u2019s work. No Senate panel has taken Mr. Kapersky up on his offer to appear. The company is best known for making commercially available antivirus software used by millions world-wide, including in some U.S. government agencies.The proposal comes amid growing fears of hacking after a global cyberattack wreaked havoc across Europe and the U.S. last week, exposing fresh weakness in the computer systems that run modern-day societies.U.S. intelligence and law-enforcement officials have raised public concerns about Kaspersky\u2019s links to the Kremlin, though none have publicly laid out specific concerns about the company or its products.In a statement, Kaspersky confirmed that Federal Bureau of Investigation agents interviewed employees this week. It didn't reveal the subject of those discussions, which remain unclear. The bureau is scrutinizing possible Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election. Former national security adviser       Mike Flynn       was a paid consultant to a U.S. subsidiary of the company before he served in the Trump administration.\u201cKaspersky Lab, and its founder and CEO Eugene Kaspersky, do not have ties to any government, and the company has never helped, nor will help, any government in the world with any cyberespionage efforts,\u201d the company said in a statement.\u201cThe company has a 20-year history in the IT security industry of always abiding by the highest ethical business practices, and Kaspersky Lab believes it is completely unacceptable that the company is being unjustly accused without any hard evidence to back up these false allegations.\u201dIn public testimony in May, several senior U.S. intelligence and law-enforcement officials including the head of the FBI voiced concerns about the company\u2019s work and products, without offering any details.\u201cWe are very concerned about it and we are focused on it very closely,\u201d said FBI Acting Director       Andrew McCabe       during a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on world-wide threats to U.S. national security.Sen.       Jeanne Shaheen,        a Democrat on the Armed Services Committee who wrote the provision, said there was a growing sense in Congress that the government should curb its use of Kaspersky products. It isn\u2019t clear how widely used Kaspersky software is within the Department of Defense.\u201cAs Russia continues to exploit weaknesses in our nation\u2019s technology, Congress must take action to make our nation less vulnerable to cyberattacks,\u201d Ms. Shaheen said. \u201cMy amendment was accepted with broad bipartisan support and directs the Department of Defense to cease using Kaspersky products immediately.\u201dThe legislation would also ban the use of Kaspersky software to help secure any network connection between the Pentagon and other government agencies. It is likely to draw bipartisan support in the full Senate.

He has the same goal for everyone: to teach them the virtues of T.M., as it\u2019s called\u2014a practice that involves silently reciting a mantra over and over for 15 to 20 minutes twice a day.Proponents say that the practice reduces stress and raises self-awareness. Bridgewater founder and co-chairman       Ray Dalio,        a student of Mr. Roth\u2019s for more than a decade and a donor to the foundation, is a believer. The practice has been \u201cintegral to whatever success I\u2019ve had in life,\u201d he says. \u201cIt makes one feel like\u2026a ninja in a movie, like you\u2019re doing everything calmly and in slow motion.\u201dMr. Roth, 66, is chief executive of the David Lynch Foundation, a nonprofit he co-founded with the film director in 2005 that is dedicated to teaching transcendental meditation, particularly to at-risk populations, \u201cto improve their health, cognitive capabilities and performance in life,\u201d as the foundation\u2019s website says. Some of its funds come from teaching courses to companies and individuals; a four-day training course costs up to $960 a person. The foundation has 60 employees in the U.S. as well as partners in 35 countries.In early June, Mr. Roth opened the nonprofit\u2019s first office in Washington, D.C., where he says he is currently teaching a dozen members of Congress. His organization has also been participating in studies in prisons recently. In a study published last year in the Permanente Journal, 181 male inmates at the Oregon State Correctional Institute and the Oregon State Penitentiary in Salem either took a transcendental meditation program through the foundation or did nothing outside their usual routine. The researchers found greater reductions in anxiety, depression and trauma symptoms in the group that had taken meditation.Mr. Roth finds an analogy in the sea. \u201cThe ocean can be active and turbulent on the surface, sometimes with tsunami-like 30-foot waves, but is, by its nature, silent at its depth,\u201d he says. \u201cThe surface of the mind is the active, noisy, thinking mind\u2014often racing, noisy, hyperactive, turbulent. But like the ocean, the mind of everyone is quiet, calm, silent at its depth.\u201dT.M. was developed in India by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, a physicist turned meditation teacher, in the 1950s; it gained popularity in the 1960s when he worked with the Beatles and other celebrities.The son of a doctor and a teacher, Mr. Roth dreamed of being a senator when he was young. He started meditating in college at the University of California, Berkeley, after a friend suggested it as a way to relax amid the student riots on campus.He was skeptical at first but soon became hooked. After he graduated in 1972, he started teaching meditation to children in inner-city schools in San Francisco. A few years later, he traveled to Europe to study under Maharishi Mahesh Yogi before returning to California to continue teaching over the next decade. In 1982, he moved to Washington, D.C., where he eventually met Mr. Lynch, the director of \u201cBlue Velvet\u201d and \u201cTwin Peaks,\u201d who had taken up the practice in the 1970s. \u201cIf you are a human being, [transcendental meditation] works,\u201d says Mr. Lynch.Contrary to what you might expect for a meditation teacher, Mr. Roth often wears a suit with a crisp white shirt.

Coupled with data earlier Friday suggesting Canadian economic output expanded for a sixth straight month in April, the survey\u2019s findings are likely to bolster expectations for a rate increase July 12.\u201cThe two reports are unambiguously supporting an imminent rate hike,\u201d said       Sebastien Lavoie,        chief economist at Laurentian Bank Securities in Montreal.Responses to the survey \u201csuggest business activity is continuing to gain momentum,\u201d the central bank said, \u201cbuoyed by indications that domestic demand will improve further. Positive business prospects are increasingly widespread across regions and sectors.\u201dFor instance, the survey of managers at roughly 100 firms indicated half of respondents expect sales growth to rise at a faster pace compared with the previous 12-month period. Furthermore, hiring intentions hit a record level, the bank said, with two-thirds of firms signaling their levels of employment would be higher in a year from now, whereas 8% suggested they would be lower.The central bank said investment intentions among companies remain elevated, and continue to point to an increase in capital spending over the next 12 months.\u201cThe focus of firms\u2019 investments has shifted toward expanding capacity to accommodate growing sales, with many businesses referring to improving domestic demand as the main driver of their investment decisions,\u201d it said.Survey respondents also said improving demand was pushing their operations closer to capacity, and labor-related constraints have become more prevalent, \u201csuggesting that labor markets are tightening.\u201dBank of Canada senior officials were presented with the survey\u2019s findings roughly a week ago, according to central bank decision-making protocol. Days later, Bank of Canada Gov.       Stephen Poloz       said in a broadcast interview that excess slack in the Canadian economy is now being absorbed \u201csteadily\u201d at the current pace of growth, and this would have to be taken into account when crafting its policy-rate decision on July 12.The Bank of Canada gives considerable weight to the survey results when crafting rate decisions, because they capture intentions and managers\u2019 attitudes that don\u2019t necessarily show up in lagging macroeconomic data.Earlier Friday, Statistics Canada reported economic output in April rose 0.2%, following a 0.5% advance in March. Analysts say that puts Canada on track for roughly 2.5% annualized growth in the April-to-June period. In the first quarter, gross domestic product advanced 3.7%, or top among the Group of Seven leading nations. Employment in Canada rose in May on a one-year basis at its fastest pace in more than four years.\u201cFew economies in the world can hold a torch to Canada\u2019s over the past four quarters,\u201d said       Derek Holt,        economist at             Bank of Nova Scotia,       following the release of April GDP data. \u201cQuite frankly, the growth Canada is posting has had more in common with emerging-market norms than developed economy growth rates across the U.S., U.K., the eurozone and Japan.\u201dMr. Holt this week altered his rate outlook, and said he expects the Bank of Canada to gradually raise its benchmark rate to 1.25% by the first quarter next year.Write to Paul Vieira at paul.vieira@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-30 12:53:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/canadian-central-bank-survey-signals-sales-hiring-to-gather-steam-1498836783", "news_title": "Canadian Central Bank Survey Signals Sales, Hiring to Gather Steam ", "keywords": " bank of canada,boc, business outlook,canada, canadian central bank, hiring, outlook, rate rise, sales, survey,Laurentian Bank Securities,Bank of Canada,plans,strategy,financial performance,earnings,sales figures,output,production,corporate,industrial news,economic performance,indicators,economic news,surveys,polls,banking,central banking,financial investments,security brokering,dealing,credit,financial services,investing,securities"}, {"content": "\u201cSpider-Man: Homecoming\u201d brings two of Hollywood\u2019s biggest competitors together in an unprecedented partnership that one company hopes will revive its movie business and the other sees serving as a two-hour promotion for its toys.Sony Pictures Entertainment paid for the $175 million production of the movie, including the writing, shooting, and editing, but the entire process was managed by             Walt Disney Co.\u2019s        DIS 1.01%       Marvel Studios.Sony will keep all of the profits \u201cHomecoming\u201d generates following its release on July 7. Disney controls all merchandise rights to the character and is betting that a hit movie will have millions more Spider-Man toys and bed sheets flying off shelves.\u201cIt\u2019s an unusual thing for two companies that are so competitive, but it\u2019s better for each to have a Spider-Man movie that really works,\u201d said       Amy Pascal,        a producer of \u201cHomecoming\u201d and former head of Sony Corp.\u2019s motion picture business who helped arrange the unlikely partnership.The Spider-Man franchise has had dual masters since 1999, when Sony bought big-screen rights to the character from Marvel, then an independent company. The deal gave the comic-book publisher 5% of film revenue and called for the two companies to split revenue from related Spider-Man merchandise.The first movie Sony made under the arrangement, 2002\u2019s \u201cSpider-Man,\u201d was a massive hit, grossing $822 million world-wide, as were the 2004 and 2007 sequels. But ticket sales declined for a poorly received 2012 reboot, \u201cThe Amazing Spider-Man,\u201d and its sequel, which grossed a weak $709 million in 2014.In a 2011 renegotiation designed to resolve years of behind-the-scenes legal disputes and provide Sony with much-needed cash, the Japanese company gave up its share of merchandise rights while Marvel, Disney-owned by that time, agreed to forgo its 5% of film revenue and make a one-time payment of $175 million and pay up to $35 million for each future film.Now that it kept all the profit from Spider-Man merchandise, Disney cared more deeply about that business, which declined as the movies lost momentum. U.S. toy sales of Spider-Man fell to $200 million for a 12-month period bracketing the release of \u201cThe Amazing Spider-Man 2\u201d in 2014, from $385 million in the year around the release of 2004\u2019s \u201cSpider-Man 2,\u201d according to NPD Group.As Sony executives struggled with their next move for the character after \u201cThe Amazing Spider-Man 2,\u201d Marvel lobbied to take back creative control. A team led by Marvel Studios President       Kevin Feige       that made the hits \u201cAvengers\u201d and \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy\u201d figured they could make a better movie, generating higher box-office and toy sales. Sony agreed in 2015, a little more than two months after a huge cyberhack revealed that talks were ongoing and after much internal debate, according to current and former employees.No money changed hands under the deal. The only tweak to the prior arrangement was that in exchange for its producing services, Marvel gets to reduce the $35 million it would owe on \u201cHomecoming\u201d if the movie grosses more than $750 million, said people with knowledge of the arrangement.\u201cHomecoming,\u201d which portrays Spider-Man as a high-school student and is meant to echo director John Hughes\u2019s 1980s teen comedies, plays up the character\u2019s inexperience and insecurity in comparison to the wealth and confidence of Avengers characters like Robert Downey Jr.\u2019s Iron Man, who appears in the film.\u201cHe sees the Marvel universe from the ground level, which is who he is in the comics but not something that we\u2019ve seen in a movie before,\u201d said Mr. Feige, who also is a producer.Disney is hoping \u201cHomecoming\u201d audiences will skew younger than prior \u201cSpider-Man\u201d or Marvel films and provide a further jolt to toy sales, a person close to the company said.Many fans are excited simply to see Spider-Man interact with other Marvel superheroes, as he has done in comic books since the 1960s but never before on the big screen because of the rights split between Sony and Disney..Sony, which closely watched Marvel\u2019s work on \u201cHomecoming\u201d and had final say on all decisions, is headed for its biggest hit in years, according to market research. It is in the midst of a prolonged box-office slump, ranking it last or second-to-last among Hollywood\u2019s major studios for three straight years.The studio is also planning to take advantage of \u201cHomecoming\u201d by launching its own related but distinct cinematic universe using its rights to more than 900 characters who have appeared in Spider-Man comics. In addition to an animated Spider-Man feature, it is working on \u201cVenom,\u201d an anti-hero who will be played by Tom Hardy, for release next year and \u201cBlack Cat and Sable,\u201d about a pair of super-heroines.Sony hopes its comic-book movies will stand out from those made by Marvel, as the two companies will be competitors if also business partners.\u201cThey won\u2019t be like any Spider-Man movie or Marvel movie that has been made before,\u201d said       Sanford Panitch,        president of Sony\u2019s Columbia Pictures label.Marvel and Sony have the right to terminate their cooperation on Spider-Man movies at any point, but for now have no plans to do so. The web slinger will make brief appearances in a pair of coming \u201cAvengers\u201d sequels and Marvel is already developing a sequel to \u201cHomecoming,\u201d which Sony will pay to make with its release scheduled for the summer of 2019.Write to Ben Fritz at ben.fritz@wsj.comAppeared in the July 1, 2017, print edition as 'Rivals Join to Spin Gold.'", "news_time": "2017-06-30 12:46:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/spider-man-a-175-million-commercial-for-disney-toys-1498815005", "news_title": "\u2018Spider-Man:\u2019 A $175 Million Commercial for Disney Toys ", "keywords": "Walt Disney,DIS,Sony Pictures Entertainment,6758.TO,Sony,SNE,Amy Pascal,Kevin Feige,John Hughes,Robert Downey Jr,Tom Hardy,Sanford Panitch,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,arts,entertainment,movies,computers,consumer electronics,personal electronics,dolls,toys,games,television,film production,cinema film production,broadcasting,cable broadcasting,consumer goods,leisure,travel goods,media,technology"}, {"content": "TALLINN, Estonia\u2014The European Union is still under threat from the far right despite the election of a pro-European president in France, a top EU official warned Friday.Questions about the EU\u2019s future abounded last year after the U.K. decision to leave the bloc and the rise of nationalist, anti-EU parties across the Continent. The election of U.S. President       Donald Trump,        who had expressed euroskeptic views, contributed to uncertainty about the bloc\u2019s future.But a string of elections over the past few months in several countries, including France, reversed that trend and triggered a return in pro-EU sentiment.\u201cI was very happy when       Emmanuel Macron       was elected,\" said European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker during a news conference here.\"But the danger of far extreme-right forces still exists\u2014don\u2019t believe this is over,\u201d he said, pointing to the fact that 11 million voters in France chose Mr. Macron\u2019s anti-EU, nationalist rival,       Marine Le Pen.Mr. Juncker\u2019s remarks constitute a rare admission that the existential threats posed to the EU by nationalist politicians haven\u2019t been completely overcome, despite improving sentiment about the EU.A Eurobarometer survey published last week showed that 43% of respondents had a positive view of the EU, surpassing neutral (37%) and negative opinions (21%) for the first time since last year\u2019s decision by the U.K. to leave the bloc. Optimism about the future of the EU was also on the rise, at 56% compared with 50% last year, while pessimism dropped to 38% from 44%.

Excluding the often-volatile categories of food and energy, so-called core prices were also up 1.4%, the lowest level since December 2015.The Fed, tasked with promoting full employment and stable prices, targets a 2% annual inflation rate. The price index poked above that threshold in February for the first time in nearly five years but has settled lower each month since.\u201cAlthough the real economy is doing well, Fed officials are concerned that isn\u2019t translating into stronger inflationary pressures,\u201d       Paul Ashworth,        chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics, said in a note to clients.Despite soft readings, the Fed\u2019s policy-making committee earlier this month decided to raise its benchmark interest rate by a quarter percentage point and penciled in one more increase for later this year.Fed Chairwoman       Janet Yellen       said the weak inflation numbers largely reflect temporary factors, such as falling prices on cellphone plans, and smaller-than-normal rises for drug prices.\u201cWith employment near its maximum sustainable level and the labor market continuing to strengthen, the committee still expects inflation to move up and stabilize around 2% over the next couple of years,\u201d Ms. Yellen said.The unemployment rate was 4.3% in May, the lowest level in 16 years.Not all Fed officials expect a tight labor market to spur inflation. Earlier this week, St. Louis Fed President       James Bullard       said policy makers don\u2019t need to continue steadily raising rates amid modest economic growth and tame prices.\u201cLow unemployment readings are probably not an indicator of meaningfully higher inflation over the forecast horizon,\u201d Mr. Bullard said Thursday.On a monthly basis, the price index fell 0.1% in May from April. Core prices were up 0.1%.Outside of inflation, the economy appears to be advancing at a steady if unspectacular pace.Personal-consumption expenditures, a measure of household spending on everything from new cars to medical care, increased a seasonally adjusted 0.1% in May from the prior month, the Commerce report said. The measure had risen 0.4% the prior two months.Instead of splashing out, Americans saved more, boosting the personal-saving rate to 5.5%, its highest level in eight months.\u201cAmericans are in good shape to increase consumption\u2014the question is when?\u201d       Eugenio Alem\u00e1n,        senior economist at Wells Fargo, said in a note to clients.Consumer confidence in the economy has been relatively high since       Donald Trump       won the presidential election, though it has moderated in recent months.

Researchers of a 2005 study observed that 70% of fathers and 74% of mothers demonstrated preferential treatment to one of their children.Favoritism is as widespread as it is taboo, says Washington, D.C., psychologist Ellen Weber Libby, author of \u201cThe Favorite Child.\u201d \u201cParents need to know that favoritism is normal,\u201d she says, and it exists to some degree in every family. Some parents may prefer a child who is more like them. The favorite can also change over time; a parent may prefer a child in a particular stage, such as an infant or a teenager.However, she adds, \u201cWhen preferential treatment is consistently focused on just one child or is used to boost a parent\u2019s self-esteem and feed their own ego, then it can easily cross the line to being unhealthy.\u201dDecades of research shows that when children feel that they\u2019re not being treated equally, they can be more vulnerable to depression and low self-esteem, as well as to getting into trouble. Just the perception of favoritism can make a negative impact on a child\u2019s behavior, according to a 2014 study published in the Journal of Family Psychology.Still, it depended on the circumstances. Lead researcher Alex Jensen of Brigham Young University recruited 282 families with adolescent siblings to look at the effects of perceived preferential treatment. Through interviews with the parents and children that assessed levels of intimacy, conflict and risky behavior, Dr. Jensen found that in more distant, \u201cdisengaged\u201d families, children who viewed themselves as slightly less favored were twice as likely to use alcohol, cigarettes or drugs. In close families, perceptions of favoritism didn\u2019t have an impact.Being the golden child can come with its own set of baggage, too, according to a 2015 study published in the Journal of Gerontology: Social Sciences. Researchers interviewed 725 adult children and their mothers to assess levels of emotional closeness, conflict and perceptions of a mother\u2019s pride and disappointment, as well as of depressive symptoms among the children.The researchers found that those who were perceived to be the closest emotionally to their mothers paid a price. \u201cFavored adult children reported higher depressive symptoms than did other siblings, possibly due to strained sibling relationships and increased feelings of responsibility for the emotional care of their mothers,\u201d says the study\u2019s lead author J. Jill Suitor, a professor of sociology at Purdue University.For parents, having a favorite child can elicit feelings of guilt, which can lead to denial. Dr. Libby says, \u201cDenying your favoritism is the worst thing a parent can do because it will make you less likely to pay attention to it.\u201d Accepting that favoritism likely happens in your family, she says, will better equip you to address it head on with your own children.Some tips for keeping a healthy balance at home:Don\u2019t compare. Dr. Jensen\u2019s recent research finds that some children are more focused on how they measure up to their siblings, and that those children are more likely to show signs of depression. Avoid comments like, \u201cWhy can\u2019t you be more like your brother?\u201d which can normalize and encourage harmful comparisons.Play favorites equally. Make sure each child gets star treatment: For example, if weekends are consumed by your daughter\u2019s soccer games, then find time during the week to focus on your son\u2019s interests.Get feedback. To keep yourself in check, ask your spouse for feedback, says Dr. Libby. If you\u2019re a single parent, ask a trusted friend. You can start the conversation by asking, \u201cIn your honest opinion, do I treat my children fairly? Do I recognize their individual needs?\u201dListen for complaints. When children point out favoritism, listen to them, says Dr. Libby. Be open to what they have to say and resist the urge to defend yourself or to deny it. Welcome the opportunity to have an open conversation instead.\u2014Ms. Wallace is a freelance writer based in New York.Appeared in the July 1, 2017, print edition as 'YES, PARENTS DO HAVE A FAVORITE CHILD.'", "news_time": "2017-06-30 12:27:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/parents-do-have-a-favorite-child-1498840029", "news_title": "Parents Do Have a Favorite Child", "keywords": "favorite child,more on parenting,parenting,parenting advice,parenting tips"}, {"content": "Inflation has been low for so long, Americans are getting used to it. For the Federal Reserve, that is a big problem.The Fed assumes inflation is about to heat up but instead it is running cold. The Commerce Department on Friday said its measure of consumer prices\u2014the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation gauge\u2014was up just 1.4% on the year in May. The core measure, which excludes food and energy prices to better capture inflation\u2019s trend, was also up 1.4%, marking its slimmest gain since late 2015.As usual, there are arguments that transitory factors, such as lower costs for wireless plans, may be pulling overall prices downward. Other shifts, such as falling apparel prices, don\u2019t seem so temporary. If inflation is going to reach the Fed\u2019s 2%, it is going to take time.The problem for the Fed is that regardless of what is keeping prices down, the longer inflation stays low, the lower people\u2019s inflation expectations go. Those low expectations feed into actual prices, because even during times of low unemployment\u2014such as now\u2014people don\u2019t demand as many wage increases and they don\u2019t spend now in anticipation of higher prices later.Investors\u2019 inflation expectations have been running cold for a while now. The Treasury market implies that the Labor Department\u2019s consumer-price index (which runs hotter than the Commerce Department\u2019s gauge) will post an average gain of about 1.7% over the next decade..What is more worrisome is that consumers\u2019 inflation expectations have been grinding lower. On Friday, the University of Michigan said consumers it surveyed in June expect inflation to average 2.5% over the next five years, a bit higher than the 2.4% they expected in May, but a half point lower than what they forecast in 2007.Consumers\u2019 forecast of 2.5% inflation is, of course, higher than the Fed\u2019s 2% target. But consumer inflation forecasts are consistently above prevailing rates. Economists at Evercore ISI suggest that a weakening trend in many services prices is consistent with actual inflation expectations that are about a quarter point short of the Fed\u2019s target.A quarter point short might not seem like all that much, but it could cause some real problems for the Fed. If it wants to push expectations back up, it may need to leave policy looser for longer\u2014and risking speculative excesses building as a result.But if it settles for inflation at 1.75%, it not only would hurt its credibility over its inflation target, it would be setting the economy\u2019s just-right level of overnight interest rates a quarter point lower. Then, when the next recession came, as it someday will, it would have a quarter-point less in cuts before interest rates hit the zero bound.Write to Justin Lahart at justin.lahart@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-30 12:26:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/inflation-amnesia-threatens-the-fed-1498839973", "news_title": "Inflation Amnesia Threatens the Fed", "keywords": "commerce department,consumers,federal reserve,inflation,labor,labor department,middle class consumers,Federal Reserve,economic performance,indicators,prices,economic news,commodity markets,commodity,financial market news"}, {"content": "Some of the 20th century\u2019s most influential furniture designers had a soft spot for plywood, the highly durable, lightweight wood product lurking beneath the surface of much of modern life and often dismissed as \u201creal\u201d wood\u2019s poor relation.To illustrate just how much can be done with it, London\u2019s Victoria and Albert Museum has put together \u201cPlywood: Material of Modern Life,\u201d a new 147-work exhibition that shows the material in forms ranging from high-modernist chairs to mid-Cold War fallout shelters.The technique of creating plywood\u2014thin layers of wood, glued together with their grain running in alternate directions\u2014dates back at least to ancient Egypt, says co-curator       Christopher Wilk.Plywood came into its own starting in the mid-19th century, when mechanized saws started to create thinner, less expensive and more-regular wood layers. The exhibition, which opens July 15 and runs into the fall, seeks to credit modern plywood\u2019s industrial-age innovators\u2014above all, Singer Manufacturing.Singer sold not only plywood stands for its sewing machines but also other plywood furniture, even felling trees from company-owned forests to make the material. From the 1880s to the 1950s, Singer was probably the world\u2019s largest plywood furniture manufacturer, Mr. Wilk says. Meanwhile, plywood tea chests\u2014cases used for shipping\u2014kept the British Empire\u2019s critical teatime going, while the Edwardian Ernest Shackleton adapted the chests\u2019 forms for his Antarctic explorations.Among the earliest works in the roughly chronological display are designs by German-American John Henry Belter, the master of ornate Victorian furniture, who took advantage of plywood\u2019s lightness to produce his otherwise weighty, neo-rococo pieces. The V&A is exhibiting a curved-back chair from around 1860, for which Belter turned to rosewood-veneer plywood because solid rosewood was both too expensive and too heavy to shape into a curve.By the 1930s, plywood was turning into a favorite material for some of the world\u2019s top designers. Finnish architect       Alvar Aalto       won a commission to design a sanatorium for tuberculosis patients outside Turku, in the southwest of the country. Inspired by Bauhaus-era Germany\u2019s tubular steel furniture, Aalto reinterpreted their curves and angles in plywood, coming up with a building full of such pieces.One of the German-based masters of the tubular steel furniture that inspired Aalto,       Marcel Breuer,        turned to plywood himself after fleeing Nazi Germany for London, creating plywood classics for the furniture maker Isokon. The pieces are now valued for their comfort as well as their flowing lines. The show includes a Breuer prototype dining table, made of five-ply molded birch plywood.In America, Charles and       Ray Eames       advanced their plywood prowess with a waterproof plywood splint, created as medical gear for the Navy during World War II. Their DCM chair of 1946, with a molded-plywood seat and back, managed to be ergonomic before the term became widely used and spawned many homages\u2014some of which are in the new V&A show, along with one of the originals.\u201cPlywood\u201d might seem to be a departure from the V&A\u2019s newfound penchant for shows with a higher glamour quotient, often emphasizing fashion or popular culture. Museum Director       Tristram Hunt       disagrees. \u201cThere is something sexy and groovy about plywood,\u201d he says, citing \u201cthe unexpected\u201d nature of objects like the displayed 1967 British Formula Two racing car, with critical components of birch plywood.Today, certain plywood works can get high prices at auction. In 2015, a Breuer Isokon plywood chaise lounge from 1936 sold for $81,250 at Wright, the design auction house. A year later, a circa 1950 Aalto plywood table sold for \u20ac375,900, or about $425,000 today, overshooting a presale estimate of \u20ac1,000\u2013\u20ac1,500 at a Paris auction.As for those Eames plywood splints, the Navy bought something like 150,000 of them. But far from being treated as antique medical supplies, they have become \u201cextraordinary art objects,\u201d says       Robert McCarter,        a professor of architecture at St. Louis\u2019s Washington University and the author of a recent book about Breuer. \u201cI have a friend who has one, and I\u2019m quite jealous.\u201dAppeared in the July 1, 2017, print edition as 'Plywood\u2019s Star Turn.'", "news_time": "2017-06-30 12:16:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/in-london-a-celebration-of-plywood-1498839388", "news_title": "In London, a Celebration of Plywood ", "keywords": " art, breuer, furniture, galleries, london tourism, london travel, museums,plywood, v&a museum, victoria and albert museum,art,political,general news,arts,entertainment,calendar of events,routine general news"}, {"content": "MOSCOW\u2014Russian officials are cautious about expectations for a fresh start in relations with Washington despite a planned first meeting between Russian President       Vladimir Putin       and President       Donald Trump       next week.Mr. Trump\u2014who once expressed the hope that Mr. Putin would become his \u201cnew best friend\u201d in a 2013 tweet\u2014is embroiled in investigations over links between Russia and members of his campaign team and inner circle. Russia\u2019s political establishment, which once hoped for a dramatic about-face in relations, now believes the U.S. president is hamstrung on foreign policy.On Friday, the day after senior U.S. officials confirmed the two leaders would meet on the sideline of the Group of 20 wealthiest nations summit in Hamburg, Germany, Russian Foreign Minister       Sergei Lavrov       expressed hope that \u201cpragmatism will prevail.\u201dBut he added that U.S.-Russian relations \u201chave become hostage to the internal politics\u201d inside Washington.\u201cWe expect that the meeting of our presidents in Hamburg ... will bring clarity to the question of the prospects for Russian-American interaction,\u201d the Russian diplomat said. Russian lawmakers and diplomats have for months now been peddling the line that the U.S. \u201cestablishment\u201d or \u201cdeep state\u201d won\u2019t allow Trump to have a rapprochement with Russia.Mr. Lavrov was speaking at a forum in Moscow attended by former U.S. Secretary of State       Henry Kissinger,        whose remarks on the history of U.S.-Russian relations were carried on Russian state television. The American statesman also met with Mr. Putin in the Kremlin on Thursday.\u201cTensions between the United States and Russia are not a rare event\" historically, Mr. Kissinger said, but he added that the two countries have been able to overcome differences through negotiation and diplomatic effort.U.S.-Russian relations have been under extraordinary strain since Moscow annexed the Black Sea region of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. The Russian government\u2019s backing of Syrian President       Bashar al-Assad       has further stoked confrontation, particularly after a suspected chemical attack that the U.S. blamed on the regime prompted Mr. Trump to order airstrikes on a Syrian base.Kremlin spokesman       Dmitry Peskov       didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment on expectations for the upcoming meeting. Mr. Peskov told Russian news agencies Friday the format of the meeting was in discussion.Mr. Putin\u2019s attendance at the G-20 may play well with the Kremlin\u2019s domestic audience, Russian political observers say.       Andrei Kolesnikov,        senior associate at the Carnegie Moscow Center, said the meeting represents a \u201cwin-win for Putin,\u201d who gets to play leader on the world stage, whether or not he hits it off with Mr. Trump.\u201cIt\u2019s not an Australian situation like it was several years ago,\u201d Mr. Kolesnikov said, referring to the G-20 meeting in November 2014, when the Kremlin leader departed the summit early after being scolded by other leaders over Moscow\u2019s role in the Ukraine crisis. After the Syria intervention, Russia became a major player in the Middle East, a move that also raised Mr. Putin\u2019s stature as someone capable of rearranging the chess pieces.What\u2019s more, Mr. Putin has been able to project confidence since the onset of the Ukraine crisis: His country has returned to economic growth, and his military has scored successes in propping up the regime of Mr. Assad.The World Bank projects GDP growth for Russia of 1.3% this year, after two years of recession. And the Russian military recently said it may have killed Islamic State leader       Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi       in an airstrike in Syria in late May, though the Pentagon has not confirmed that claim.Russia continues to chafe under U.S. and Western sanctions imposed after Moscow annexed the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea from Ukraine. And the Russia scandal roiling Washington has rolled back hopes in Russia that Mr. Trump would make a sweeping deal with Mr. Putin that would reset relations in exchange for curtailing or softening sanctions.Talk instead in Moscow now focuses on living with sanctions. The Russian economy is returning slowly to economic growth, and economic analysts say businesses have adapted to sanctions.Some sectors of the economy have even thrived: Russia\u2019s agriculture firms have seen growth amid \u201ccounter-sanctions\u201d imposed by Russia on European importers in retaliation for EU measures. Russian Prime Minister       Dmitry Medvedev       on Thursday said Russian agribusiness had asked the government to continue extending such measures.\u201cI am sure that they will be able to take advantage of these opportunities in full,\u201d he said.Mr. Putin signed a decree Friday extending those sanctions until the end of 2018.", "news_time": "2017-06-30 12:05:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/no-thaw-likely-at-trump-putin-meeting-1498838730", "news_title": "No Thaw Likely at Trump-Putin Meeting ", "keywords": "kremlin,russia politics,russia-us relations,u.s. politics,Vladimir Putin,political,general news,international relations,politics,domestic politics"}, {"content": "PARIS\u2014Paris prosecutors pressed preliminary charges of breach of trust against National Front party leader       Marine Le Pen       as part of an investigation into whether she misused European Union funds, according to a person familiar with the matter.French authorities suspect Ms. Le Pen, who was a member of the European Parliament between July 2004 and June 2017, cut checks to party officials using funds earmarked for parliamentary assistants, according to the person familiar with the matter.At the end of the probe, magistrates could decide to charge Ms. Le Pen and order her to trial, or dismiss the preliminary charges.A lawyer for Ms. Le Pen didn\u2019t respond for a request to comment. Ms. Le Pen did not immediately respond to an email request for comment. She has previously dismissed the allegations as an attempt to thwart the National Front.The preliminary charges come as a new blow to Ms. Le Pen, who has seen support for her far-right party crumble in recent weeks. After knocking at the gates of power in May, the National Front won just 8 of the 577 seats in French Parliament earlier this month, dashing Ms. Le Pen\u2019s hopes of leading France\u2019s opposition party.The French probe stems from investigations EU authorities conducted in 2014 and 2015 into whether Ms. Le Pen and other National Front representatives to the European Parliament improperly paid their political aides.In 2009, Ms. Le Pen employed her father\u2019s bodyguard, Thierry L\u00e9gier, for three months as a parliamentary assistant, according to a 2016 report prepared by OLAF, the EU antifraud office, and reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. During that period, he continued working with her father, according to Mr. L\u00e9gier\u2019s 2012 autobiography.In 2011, Ms. Le Pen gave him a new contract that ran from October to December at a monthly rate of \u20ac7,237 after taxes, according to the report. The average salary in France was \u20ac2,130 a month in 2011, and most European Parliament assistants are paid much less.Mr. L\u00e9gier said he has been questioned by police, declining to comment further.Ms. Le Pen also hired her former sister-in-law Catherine Griset for an assistant post that under the European Parliament\u2019s rules must be based out of one of its seats in Brussels and Strasbourg, France.Between 2010 and 2015, Ms. Griset received \u20ac294,592 in salaries and expenses, despite appearing for a total of around 12 hours in the Brussels Parliament from September 2014 to August 2015, according to the OLAF report.Prosecutors have filed preliminary charges of breach of trust and receiving misappropriated funds against Ms. Griset, who didn\u2019t respond to requests to comment.\u2014Nick Kostov and Laurence Norman contributed to this article.", "news_time": "2017-06-30 11:58:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/frances-marine-le-pen-faces-preliminary-charges-over-spending-1498838303", "news_title": "France\u2019s Marine Le Pen Faces Preliminary Charges Over Spending   ", "keywords": "european parliament,french politics,marine le pen under investigation,European Parliament,Marine Le Pen,political,general news,crime,legal action,embezzlement,financial crime,fraud"}, {"content": "We Americans have a new enemy, and it is ourselves. Half of Democrats and Republicans now see members of the opposing party as not just ill-informed but actually frightening, according to the Pew Research Center. In experiments with thousands of Americans, researchers have found that partisan animosity can now exceed racial hostility: When awarding hypothetical scholarships and cash, we are more likely to discriminate based on politics than race. As of 2010, a third of Democrats and half of Republicans said that they would be upset if their children married someone from the other party\u2014up from about 5% from each group in 1960.Why do we hate each other so? One reason is that Americans are more politically segregated than in the past. We are less likely to have neighbors who belong to another party than we were 20 years ago. And one thing we know about human behavior is that it is easier to hate people you don\u2019t know.Seventy years ago, almost to the day, a group of American ambulance drivers, disgusted by the waste and carnage they\u2019d seen in the World Wars in Europe, started up a cultural exchange program between Europe and the U.S. The idea was simple: If people knew each other\u2014really knew each other\u2014they would be more tolerant of one other. It\u2019s harder to demonize someone once you\u2019ve stayed in their homes and shared meals and stories together.So after helping to evacuate Germany\u2019s Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, the American Field Service ended its volunteer ambulance corps and became a student exchange program. In 1947, 53 students from 11 nationalities came to the U.S. and France to study and live for one year among foreigners.\u201cYou can\u2019t know each other and be enemies between yourselves,\u201d President Dwight Eisenhower told a group of 1,150 foreign exchange students in Washington on the 12th anniversary of AFS. Since then, the global program has brought hundreds of thousands of young people into homes and schools far outside their comfort zones, building trust and relationships across oceans.Then, in the 1970s, the U.S. chapter of AFS started an additional program for exchanges within the country. Over the life of the program, more than a thousand teenagers would travel from Kansas to California, from Florida to New York and beyond\u2014crisscrossing the country to live for a summer or a semester with host families, discovering new food and strange customs within their own country.In June 1979, 17-year-old David Angel took a Greyhound bus from Goodland, Kan., to McConnellsville, N.Y. As his bus pulled into the station, his heart pounded in his chest. He would be living in a very small town in upstate New York, near Syracuse, but in his mind, it might as well have been Tokyo. \u201cI imagined people from New York being very sophisticated and continental,\u201d Mr. Angel said, \u201cand I was afraid I\u2019d be Mr. Redneck Country Bumpkin.\u201dBut his host family was warm and welcoming: \u201cThey met me at the bus station and just wrapped me up in their arms.\u201d That summer, Mr. Angel mixed concrete, swam in rivers and went fishing. Each evening, his host parents, grandfather and sister would gather in the living room for drinks and conversation, and Mr. Angel would listen and learn, sometimes chiming in with his own ideas. To cap off the experience, he spent a wild two weeks in New York City, visiting the Twin Towers and the Statue of Liberty and seeing \u201cThe Rocky Horror Picture Show.\u201d\u2018It makes everything less black and white.\u2019The experience left him more culturally agile. \u201cI\u2019m in my 50s now,\u201d he says, \u201cand even to this day, I use that tool regularly\u2014to remind myself, \u2018OK, this is my opinion, and that is their opinion, and there are different opinions.\u2019 It makes everything less black and white.\u201dToday, Mr. Angel lives in Los Angeles, and some of his friends lack this skill, he says. \u201cEither you\u2019re a Republican, or you\u2019re dead to them. And some of my Democratic peers are the same way,\u201d he says. \u201cI find that troubling. There is so much that our country has to offer.\u201dAFS-USA\u2019s domestic-exchange program ended sometime in the mid-1980s, as the organization returned its focus to international exchanges only. But since the 2016 election, its leaders have heard from people who want to restart the domestic program.\u201cThese days, we are asking how we can contribute to building a more just and peaceful world\u2014right here in our own country,\u201d says Jorge Castro, the president of AFS-USA, based in New York. The organization is sponsoring a national survey later this year to gauge potential interest in such a program and beginning to contemplate ways to fund domestic exchanges. \u201cBefore knowing or understanding other cultures abroad, you have to understand your own,\u201d says Mr. Castro.In 2011, as part of a book project, I followed three American exchange students who were spending a year living and studying in countries far from their homes. At first, I was struck by their courage in deciding to go to South Korea or Finland, when it would have been much easier to stay home in Minnesota or Oklahoma, surrounded by the familiar and the comfortable.But over time, I saw something even more impressive. When I visited these teenagers in their borrowed cities and villages, I could tell they were becoming more flexible, more at peace with uncertainty. Yes, they had developed empathy for other points of view, which is priceless. But they were also letting go of some of the fears that hold so many of us back. It was like they had shrugged off a layer of assumptions and judgments and could move more easily through the world, unencumbered.Americans relied on domestic-exchange programs at another point in our history: in the 1960s, a time of wrenching tensions over war and race. Back then, a group of historically black colleges and universities set up domestic exchanges with majority white universities in other states. And just as AFS did after World War II, the exchanges forced interactions that would never have happened otherwise.\u2018It\u2019s almost like two different countries.\u2019Many of those exchanges faded away with time, but not all. Every year, Brown University in Providence, R.I., and Tougaloo College, a historically black college near Jackson, Miss., still host exchanges\u2014connecting a blue state to a red one, not with commerce or webinars but with human beings who arrive with duffel bags and stay past the point of discomfort. More than 500 students and faculty have participated in the exchange over the past 50 years.\u201cIt\u2019s almost like two different countries,\u201d says Waynesha Blaylock, 23, who grew up in Texas and Mississippi before spending a semester at Brown in the spring of 2015. During her first weeks in Rhode Island, what she missed most was the Southern hospitality\u2014the way her adviser at Tougaloo would welcome her to her office every day; the way everyone would say hello on campus, without fail. At Brown, most people seemed cold and unwelcoming. And she ached for a good Sunday dinner. \u201cI could not find any good fried chicken. I was really heartbroken about that,\u201d she told me, laughing. Also, \u201csweet tea\u201d in Rhode Island is not really sweet tea, she discovered.But over time, she learned to reinterpret that aloofness\u2014to see it as cultural, not personal. And she taught the Brown students too, giving a talk in her public-speaking class on the value of Southern hospitality, for example. \u201cMost people in that class, they would all wave and stop and talk to me after that,\u201d she remembers.Today, Ms. Blaylock is in medical school\u2014back at Brown University. She wouldn\u2019t have thought to apply there if not for the exchange program, she says: \u201cI didn\u2019t know what an Ivy League school was.\u201d But she still finds herself playing the role of anthropologist every so often. \u201cThere are plenty of people here who have no idea what the South is like,\u201d she says. And that ignorance can have real consequences for physicians in training. \u201cWe have discussions about obesity,\u201d she said, \u201cand I have to explain that it\u2019s just not that easy to change your diet in the South.\u201dThe Brown students who come to Tougaloo have their own struggles. \u201cWe had a Brown student who had spent a semester in Amsterdam, and she said it was nowhere near as different from Providence as Tougaloo,\u201d says Elise Morse-Gagn\u00e9, who teaches English at Tougaloo. \u201cThe food is very different. The economy is different. The attitude toward education is different. Religion is colossal.\u201d\u2018You can\u2019t afford to be dismissive of the beliefs of the people you live around.\u2019She herself came to Tougaloo from New England. Over the years, she\u2019s learned to recognize biases in both places. In the North, for example, \u201cwhite liberal academics tend to be extremely dismissive of Christianity,\u201d she says. In Tougaloo, that kind of prejudice would be problematic. \u201cEvery meeting on campus here starts with a prayer, and it\u2019s a Christian prayer, and it\u2019s just taken for granted,\u201d she says. \u201cYou can\u2019t afford to be dismissive of the beliefs of the people you live around.\u201dTwo years ago, Ms. Morse-Gagn\u00e9\u2019s husband died, ahead of his time. And again, she was reminded of the cultural differences. \u201cPeople were warm, they were loving, and they were helpful in practical ways,\u201d she says. They brought food and they took over her classes. The college president and the provost came to the hospital. At a New England university, she suspects, many people wouldn\u2019t have known what to say or do, and the response would have been more strained.The world is a big, complicated place, but so is this country. Maybe it is time to start treating America as a collection of different countries, one that has lost its common language but remains inextricably intertwined.\u201cYou can\u2019t say that the United States is one culture. We are definitely different in every single community,\u201d says Debra Sanborn, the president of the National Student Exchange\u2014another organization started in the turbulence of the 1960s, which now works with 2,000 students at 160 different North American campuses each year. Many students leave seeking a change of weather or different classes; they don\u2019t go in search of cultural difference, but they often find it.Even within states, our differences can be bewildering, as Savannah Barrett learned in Kentucky. She grew up on a seventh-generation tobacco farm before moving to Louisville. When she first arrived, she found that city people judged her by her strong country accent. \u201cI\u2019ve been told that folks just don\u2019t think I sound smart,\u201d she says. She and a friend with a similar background were struck by how many biases city people had about country folks\u2014and vice versa.In 2014, Ms. Barrett and her friend started the Kentucky Rural-Urban Exchange to bring rural and urban people together for immersive experiences three weekends a year. To date, 160 people from 34 Kentucky counties have participated. People of all ages apply to the program, which is free, and about half are accepted, based on the mix of experiences and interests they bring to the group. The itinerary is carefully curated to deepen participants\u2019 understanding of Kentucky\u2019s history, culture and identity, while also equipping them to solve specific community problems.But it\u2019s essential to make people comfortable, too, Ms. Barrett has learned. That\u2019s when they let down their guard. \u201cWe start and end every weekend with a meal,\u201d she says. The program reflects the identity of the different Kentucky towns in which it takes place and typically includes a hike, a cultural performance and a visit to a swimming hole. \u201cWhat we have found is that it\u2019s really difficult to hate someone you\u2019ve had deep, meaningful, transformative experiences with\u2014and whose community you\u2019ve really come to value because you\u2019ve felt welcome and appreciated there.\u201dThis holiday weekend, Ms. Barrett will facilitate her own micro-exchange: bringing a group of her Louisville friends to the farm where she grew up. That\u2019s her July Fourth tradition. From experience, she knows there may be some difficult moments, but it will be worthwhile. \u201cWe crave a deeper connection with folks who are different from ourselves,\u201d she says.In recent months, people from Minnesota and other states have reached out to Ms. Barrett for advice on setting up similar exchanges, and she is working on creating a shareable tool kit.We need to make America whole again. The country has been weakened by our mutual disdain and shared ignorance. We should tap the wisdom of Ms. Barrett, AFS and other exchange experts to help us create opportunities for Independence Day exchanges across the country\u2014an annual tradition where Americans open up their backyard barbecues and remember what we have in common.We don\u2019t have to agree about politics (we won\u2019t); we don\u2019t even have to talk about       Donald Trump       (probably better not to). But as Americans, we share very few cultural traditions. So we should make July Fourth a time to come together and get reacquainted. We share more than our affection for grilled food and fireworks; we also believe in the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.And if that isn\u2019t enough, we Americans also like to win. Right now, a majority of Democrats and Republicans say members of the other party are \u201cclosed-minded,\u201d according to a 2016 Pew survey.

The move was widely telegraphed after the seven board members voted 4-3 earlier this week to reject a proposed debt restructuring agreement, as first reported by The Wall Street Journal.Friday\u2019s\u00a0vote to initiate the bankruptcy was unanimous.Creditors of the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority mounted a last-ditch campaign this week to keep the utility out of bankruptcy, filing litigation against the oversight board to preserve the proposed settlement and offering a $450 million emergency loan.\u201cWe are in ongoing negotiations with creditors\u201d that could affect when the bankruptcy petition is filed, said the oversight board\u2019s executive director Natalie Jaresko.In rejecting the proposed deal, the four board members who voted it down said it would impede efforts to shift Prepa from a government monopoly to a regulated private utility through privatization of the island\u2019s outdated and inefficient power plants.Creditors have argued that restructuring the utility\u2019s debts would pave the way for privatization by boosting Prepa\u2019s creditworthiness.A federal rescue package enacted by Congress last year empowers the oversight board to write down Puerto Rico bonds either consensually through negotiated deals or nonconsensually with the help of the courts. The territorial government itself has already entered a court-supervised restructuring proceeding in San Juan, where creditors are battling to increase their share of government revenue.Prepa, one of the largest U.S. utilities, is a flashpoint in the territory\u2019s financial crisis. The oversight board has been searching for ways to bring down power rates that fluctuate based largely on commodity prices.Bondholders had agreed to accept a 15% reduction in their claims in exchange for new debt paid from a special charge on utility ratepayers. The proposed customer surcharge was politically unpopular in Puerto Rico, where costly and unreliable power service remains a drag on economic growth and quality of life.A massive blackout last year, later blamed on a fire, plunged huge swaths of the island of more than 3 million U.S. citizens into darkness for three days.Prepa\u2019s expected bankruptcy presents another challenge for bondholders and for financial guarantors             Assured Guaranty Ltd.       and             MBIA Inc.\u2019s       National Public Finance Guarantee Corp., which insure a combined $2.2 billion in utility debt. Creditors are scheduled to receive roughly $450 million from Prepa on Monday, a payment they are virtually certain not to receive.Utility bonds have eroded in value since April, when creditors revised their terms at the request of Gov. Ricardo Rossell\u00f3, who had sought additional debt relief to ameliorate the planned consumer rate increases.He said this week he would re-evaluate the future of Prepa, long a source of popular discontent and public corruption in Puerto Rico. The bond insurers, meanwhile, are asking for a court order compelling the oversight board to approve their settlement deal.Write to Andrew Scurria at Andrew.Scurria@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-30 11:32:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/federal-officials-to-place-puerto-rico-utility-in-bankruptcy-1498832934", "news_title": "Federal Officials to Place Puerto Rico Utility in Bankruptcy ", "keywords": "bankruptcy,natalie jaresko,prepa,puerto rico,puerto rico electric power authority,Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority,anti-competition issues,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,corporate financial difficulty,government finance,government borrowing,economic news,electricity,gas utilities,utilities"}, {"content": "HSBC        HSBC 0.10%       Holdings PLC has received regulatory approval to operate a majority-owned joint-venture securities company based in China, the first foreign bank to win such a setup.The joint venture with Qianhai Financial Holdings Co.

Banks, including Goldman Sachs Group Inc., have clamored for years to get control of the businesses, hoping to reap more of the profits and be able to make more decisions on a local level.Beijing has signaled it is open to gradually allowing investment firms to have greater stakes, but so far the cap has remained in place. HSBC was able to secure a majority stake under an arrangement between Hong Kong and mainland China designed to encourage trade and economic cooperation.Under that arrangement, Hong Kong-funded financial institutions such as HSBC that satisfy various criteria are allowed to set up one such company each in Shanghai, Guangdong Province and Shenzhen.

Could you even tell if they were?Driving with worn-out tires can be dangerous, but it isn\u2019t always obvious when they need to be replaced. Now researchers at Duke University have come up with a low-cost sensor system that they say can monitor tire wear and sound the alarm when the tread is getting low. They say the sensors can also signal uneven tire wear that could point to the need for repairs or a wheel alignment. And the sensors could provide tire manufacturers with a trove of data on how their tires perform in real-world use\u2014data that could lead to safer, longer-lasting tires.The sensors are pairs of electrodes\u2014closely spaced bits of metal\u2014printed on a heat-resistant plastic sheet that can be used to line the inside of a tire. These electrodes are made of incredibly tiny structures called carbon nanotubes, known for their strength and ability to conduct electricity. A long-lived battery supplies a very small voltage to one electrode in each pair, resulting in an electrical field between pairs of electrodes. This field extends up into the rubber of the tire.As the tread wears off, the tire grows thinner, altering the electrical field. During driving, information about this field is collected by a microchip in the tire. If the tires are worn thin enough to be replaced or the wear pattern implies trouble, the car\u2019s dashboard will alert the driver. \u201cWith all of the technology and sensors that are in today\u2019s cars,\u201d says Aaron Franklin, one of the Duke scientists, \u201cit\u2019s kind of crazy to think that there\u2019s almost no data being gathered from the only part of the vehicle that is actually touching the road.\u201dDr. Franklin acknowledges that a considerable investment by an auto-industry player will be needed for the new sensors to be adopted and manufactured at scale. But he likens the new tread-sensors to the tire-pressure sensors that the U.S. government already requires in new cars\u2014and adds that the new sensors might be able to piggyback on that system, sharing some components (such as a battery). In lab tests, the scientists say, their system can measure tire depth with 99% accuracy.Dr. Franklin says that the technology could have many more uses\u2014in auto brake pads, for instance, or even inside the human body, where much smaller pairs of electrodes could be implanted. The only context in which the sensors can\u2019t function would be in a layer or wall of metal, which would block the necessary electrical field. (The sensors work well in modern steel-belted radial tires because the steel in those tires is grid-like rather than solid, allowing the electrical field to pass through.)Wherever they are used, the sensors could gather extraordinary quantities of precise data. Liberally distributed within tires, for example, they could report in detail just how tires wear. This data, once gathered, could be correlated to climate, time of day, type of car and other information available from modern vehicles and databases.At the very least, the new sensors could nudge drivers to replace worn tires. That could be particularly vital in the high-stakes sport of auto racing. There, Dr. Franklin says, the sensors could enable drivers and crews to make more informed decisions about when to stop for a tire change\u2014or permit victory with the knowledge that one more stop isn\u2019t needed.\u201cNoninvasive Material Thickness Detection by Aerosol Jet Printed Sensors Enhanced Through Metallic Carbon Nanotube Ink,\u201d Joseph Andrews, Changyong Cao, Martin Brooke and Aaron Franklin, IEEE Sensors Journal (June 5)", "news_time": "2017-06-30 11:19:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-new-way-to-sense-worn-out-tires-1498835974", "news_title": "A New Way to Sense Worn-Out Tires", "keywords": "auto racing,duke,duke university,r&d,rubber,sensors,tires,research,development,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,living,lifestyle,motor vehicle parts,automotive"}, {"content": "NPD BookScan gathers point-of-sale book data from more than 16,000 locations across the U.S., representing about 85% of the nation\u2019s book sales.

That question has been dominating discussions of President       Donald Trump\u2019s       controversial executive order instituting a travel ban, ever since the Supreme Court ruled on it earlier this week.On Monday, the court ruled that a modified version of the ban, which restricts travel from six majority-Muslim countries, could be implemented temporarily while the Trump administration appeals lower-court decisions that blocked it entirely. The high court\u2019s decision, however, exempts from the ban \u201cforeign nationals who have a credible claim of a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States.\u201dThe ruling specifies that \u201cfor individuals, a close familial relationship is required.\u201d On Wednesday, the State Department clarified to embassies that such \u201cbona fide\u201d relationships would not extend to grandparents, grandchildren, aunts and uncles, among others.There is nothing in the history of the Latin phrase \u201cbona fide\u201d that would help determine which relationships are more legitimate than others in the eyes of the law. It comes from the expression \u201cbona fides\u201d (pronounced \u201cBOH-nuh FEE-days\u201d in Latin) meaning \u201cgood faith.\u201d That becomes \u201cbona fide\u201d (\u201cBOH-nuh FEE-day\u201d) when put in the ablative case, which in English would be expressed as \u201cin good faith.\u201d The same root can be found in words like \u201cfidelity,\u201d \u201cinfidel,\u201d and the dog\u2019s name \u201cFido\u201d (literally \u201cI trust\u201d in Latin).\u201cBona fide\u201d was originally borrowed into English as an adverb describing things conducted faithfully or genuinely. During the reign of       Henry VIII       in the 1540s, an act of the English Parliament regarding bankruptcy used the phrase in this way: \u201cthe same to proceed bona fide, without fraud.\u201dBy the 18th century, \u201cbona fide\u201d also came to be used as an adjective meaning \u201cdone in good faith.\u201d Cases in the English court of chancery from 1755 referred to \u201ca bona fide payment\u201d and \u201ca bona fide purchaser.\u201dAs \u201cbona fide\u201d worked its way into English, its pronunciation became less faithful to the original Latin. It got pronounced as \u201cBOH-nuh FIE-dee,\u201d ultimately transforming (especially in American English) into \u201cBOH-nuh-fied.\u201dMeanwhile, the noun \u201cbona fides\u201d\u2014typically pronounced \u201cBOH-nuh FIE-dees\u201d\u2014has been treated as a plural (though it wasn\u2019t in Latin), given the meaning of \u201ccredentials\u201d or \u201cguarantees of good faith.\u201d In his book \u201cGarner\u2019s Modern English Usage,\u201d       Bryan Garner       writes that \u201cmaking \u2018bona fides\u2019 singular sounds pedantic; making it plural is likely to offend those who have a smattering of Latin.\u201dWhile the adjective \u201cbona fide\u201d in general use has come to mean something like \u201csincere,\u201d in legal circles it has stayed closer to its Latin roots of \u201cgood faith.\u201d Thus, when the Supreme Court seeks to specify a \u201cbona fide relationship\u201d in the travel-ban case, it isn\u2019t ruling that extended family relations are somehow less than genuine. Rather, for a traveler to qualify for an exception to the ban, authorities need to establish the person has a \u201cgood-faith\u201d claim of a close tie to someone in the U.S.And if a claim is made in bad faith?

In May of last year they finally zeroed in on him, drinking an afternoon chai in a Khartoum tea room as Sudanese police barged in to make the arrest.A year on, a growing stack of evidence suggests that one of the biggest trafficking manhunts in Europe got the wrong guy.The baby-faced man currently on trial in Sicily is not the 36-year-old smuggling kingpin, according to dozens of witnesses, digital records and Eritrea\u2019s government. Instead, indications are he is an Eritrean milk deliveryman named       Medhanie Berhe Tesfamariam       who was slowly trying to make his way to Europe when he was grabbed.There is one other source who calls the person on trial innocent: a man who says he is Mr. Mered, the real smuggler. \u201cI thought they were going to release him in no time\u2014they know that he is not the right Medhanie,\u201d he said.

Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected a final June reading of 94.4.The index, which jumped following last year\u2019s presidential election, was up 1.7% in June from a year earlier.\u201cWhile the changes in sentiment barometers have varied lately, the levels of sentiment remain solid across these measures,\u201d J.P. Morgan Chase economist Daniel Silver said in a note to clients.The details of Friday\u2019s report were mixed. An index tracking current economic conditions rose to 112.5 in June from 111.7 in May. An index tracking expectations about the future was down to 83.9 in June from May\u2019s 87.7. The overall sentiment index hit its lowest level since November.Multiple gauges of U.S. consumer, business and investor sentiment jumped following last year\u2019s presidential election. But rising optimism about the economy hasn\u2019t so far been matched by a surge in consumer spending, business investment or overall growth.Some of those measures have drifted lower in recent months, though they remain high. The Conference Board\u2019s consumer-confidence index peaked in March with its strongest reading since the end of 2000 and declined in April and May before rising slightly in June.In the Michigan survey, a partisan divide has persisted this year between pessimistic Democrats and upbeat Republicans.\u201cSurprisingly, the optimism among Republicans and Independents has largely resisted declines in the past several months despite the decreased likelihood that [President Donald] Trump\u2019s agenda will be passed in 2017,\u201d said Richard Curtin, the survey\u2019s chief economist.Preliminary data for June had found a drop in sentiment during the days after June 8, when former FBI director       James Comey       testified before Congress about his firing by President Donald Trump. \u201cThat controversy seems to have blown over quickly,\u201d Amherst Pierpont Securities chief economist       Stephen Stanley       said in a note to clients.Friday\u2019s report also showed household expectations about future inflation firmed a bit.

The bill seeks to repeal or replace large swaths of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare.While there are\u00a0some\u00a0differences between the Senate bill and\u00a0the American Health Care Act, which the House of Representatives passed in\u00a0May,\u00a0the\u00a0bills overlap in many\u00a0areas.\u00a0Those overlaps provide a likely\u00a0picture\u00a0of how the final product would affect your pocketbook.Here\u2019s the potential impact:Penalty for lack of coverage: Both bills repeal excise taxes for people who don\u2019t have appropriate coverage, retroactive to the beginning of 2016.Taxpayers who made these penalty payments will be eligible for refunds. For a married couple with two children and $150,000 of income in 2016, the penalty payment was about $3,200 in 2016.Premium tax credit: ACA provides lower-income taxpayers with upfront credits to help purchase insurance on exchanges. The Senate bill largely preserves this credit through 2019, while the House bill modifies the current credit for 2018 and 2019 by increasing it for younger adults and decreasing it for older people.Both bills substantially shrink the credits after 2019, according to       Karen Pollitz,        a fellow at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan group that provides health-care analysis.Both bills also make an important change to upfront tax credits for premiums\u00a0for lower-income people. Under ACA, recipients of premium credits whose income turns out to be higher than they estimated often don\u2019t have to repay all of the credit due to a cap on the clawback.Both House and Senate bills remove the cap on the premium clawback, Ms. Pollitz said. According to IRS data, about 90% of those claiming the credit estimated their income incorrectly.Investment income surtax: Both bills repeal the 3.8% surtax on net investment income retroactive to the beginning of 2017. On Thursday, some Senators said they were open to preserving the surtax.This levy took effect in 2013 and applies to most married couples with adjusted gross income above a threshold of $250,000 ($200,000 for single filers). Investment income includes capital gains, interest, dividends, royalties and certain rents, among other items.Additional Medicare tax:\u00a0Both bills also repeal the 0.9% additional Medicare tax for married joint filers earning more than $250,000 (or $200,000 for single filers)\u2014but not\u00a0until 2023.Medical expenses deduction: The ACA raised the threshold for deducting medical expenses to 10% of income. The Senate\u2019s bill lowers the threshold to 7.5% for all taxpayers, while the House bill lowers it to 5.8%. Both provisions take effect for 2017.Flexible spending accounts (FSAs):\u00a0The ACA imposed a $2,500 annual cap on contributions to FSAs, workplace plans that employees can fund to pay health expenses with pretax dollars. With inflation adjustments, the limit is $2,600 for 2017.Both bills remove this cap and restore the ability to use FSA funds to pay for over-the-counter medication without a prescription. The House bill is effective for 2017, and the Senate bill for 2018.Dustin Stamper,        a legislative analyst with accounting firm Grant Thornton, said if the cap is removed, many companies are likely to revert to a $5,000 limit, which was common before the ACA.Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) and Medical Spending Accounts (MSAs):\u00a0Both bills propose to expand these accounts, which allow pretax contributions to cover out-of-pocket expenses for high-deductible health plans.The permitted 2018 contribution to an HSA or MSA would increase to equal the maximum out-of-pocket limit for high-deductible plans approved by the IRS, rising from $3,450 to $6,650 for individual coverage and from $6,900 to $13,300 for family coverage.\u201cCadillac\u201d plan tax: The ACA levied a 40% tax on the value of health-coverage plans exceeding a certain threshold, but the provision\u00a0has never taken effect because it is unpopular on both sides of the aisle in Congress. Both bills push the date of this levy to 2026 from 2020.Tanning tax: A last-minute deal in the ACA shifted a \u201cBotox tax\u201d on cosmetic procedures to users of tanning parlors. The revenue has fallen far short of projections, said analyst Scott Greenberg of the Tax Foundation, a research group.\u00a0For example, it raised\u00a0only $78 million of the expected $300 million\u00a0in 2015.The House bill repeals the 10% tanning tax as of\u00a0June 30, while the Senate bill delays it until Sept. 30\u2014when many tanners move indoors.Corrections & Amplifications   Scott Greenberg is an analyst at the Tax Foundation.

The company is projected to have sold 23,655 vehicles during the three-month period, according to the average estimate of four analysts surveyed by The Wall Street Journal.A record first quarter of about 25,000 deliveries helped fan enthusiasm for Tesla and put the company on track to meet its goal of selling 47,000 to 50,000 Model S sedans and Model X sport-utility vehicles during the first half of this year.Write to Tim Higgins at Tim.Higgins@WSJ.com", "news_time": "2017-06-30 10:47:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musk-teases-sunday-announcement-about-tesla-model-3-timing-1498834043", "news_title": "Elon Musk Teases Sunday Announcement About Tesla Model 3 Timing   ", "keywords": "electric cars,elon musk,elon musk twitter,tesla model 3,tesla model 3 pricing,tesla model 3 pricing announcement,Tesla,TSLA,Elon Musk,financial performance,share price movement,disruptions,output,production,corporate,industrial news,motor vehicles,alternative fuel vehicles,automotive,technology"}, {"content": "Professional football player       Paul Kruger       is putting his multi-sport Colorado estate on the market for $8.5 million, a 57% markup from what he paid for it less than a year ago.Located in Evergreen, an upscale community about 35 miles west of Denver, the over 9,000-square-foot house has views of snowcapped Mount Evans, said Emily Henderson of LIV Sotheby\u2019s International Realty, one of the listing agents.Known as \u201cSerenity Falls,\u201d the roughly 30-acre estate gets its name from the multiple waterfalls integrated into the landscaping.

Instead, it is getting a duck. A bright yellow duck that is six stories high and inflatable.The big duck, which will help kick off the country\u2019s 150th birthday festivities on Saturday, is being subjected to polite yet persistent criticism that it\u2019s not really Canadian enough. Other suggestions: a giant maple leaf or a singing beaver.\u201cNothing says \u2018Celebrate Canada!\u2019 like a 30,000-pound rubber duck by a foreign artist,\u201d scoffed       Aaron Wudrick,        federal director of the Canadian Taxpayers Federation in Ottawa, one of many Canadians ruffled by the plan, partly funded by public money.The towering waterfowl, which the organizers of Toronto\u2019s Redpath Waterfront Festival are renting from a U.S. company, has spawned bewilderment on social media, become the subject of Canadian parliamentary debates and triggered a protest at the offices of top lawmakers.Part of the issue is the price tag of roughly 71,000 Canadian dollars, or US$54,000, to rent the duck and dock it around the Toronto harbor at a time when worries are rising over the level of debt in Ontario, Canada\u2019s most populous province.It is also a matter of national pride, which is also a Canadian obsession. \u201cIt\u2019s our country\u2019s birthday,\u201d says Mr. Wudrick. \u201cNo one wants to be a party pooper. But at least make sure the festivities have something to do with Canada.\u201dHis organization helped irate citizens in June launch a \u201cduck off\u201d campaign and organized their purchases of 797 mini rubber ducks that were dumped outside the office of Ontario\u2019s highest government official, Premier       Kathleen Wynne.       On Twitter, inflatable-duck objectors applauded the move, posting messages such as \u201cIf you the need the visual to celebrate, go stand in front of a Maple tree,\u201d and reminding people \u201cThis duck is not Canuck.\u201dFestival co-producer Lea Parrell defended the choice, saying it is \u201csomething off-the-wall that makes people smile,\u201d but sympathizes with those calling for a more Canadian symbol.\u201cWe did want a loon,\u201d she sighed, referring to Canada\u2019s ubiquitous black-and-white plumed bird that adorns the country\u2019s one-dollar coin. \u201cWe wanted a loon so badly.\u201dThe cost to design and build an inflatable loon from scratch was too high, she said.Canada\u2019s national parks agency said it has looked into having another typically Canadian species, a giant inflatable beaver, at the festival to square off with the duck, but one wasn\u2019t available, a spokeswoman said. Instead, the agency will display a smaller 12-foot-tall version of its mascot Parka, a singing beaver wearing park-ranger clothes.Sophia Kane, a 19-year-old student sitting on a bench along Toronto\u2019s waterfront this week, said people should relax and embrace the duck, but suggested that \u201cnext year, we should build a giant moose and shoot fireworks out from its antlers.\u201dThe giant duck has confused some tourists who couldn\u2019t understand the connection between the yellow bird and Canada\u2019s celebration.\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t you have a giant maple leaf instead?\u201d asked Jagdeep Walia, a 29-year-old resident of Virginia Beach, Va.Apart from the duck and beaver, other celebratory initiatives include a life-size game of snakes and ladders in Calgary \u201cto embody the ups and downs\u201d of the city\u2019s history, according to organizers. A red couch is being hauled across the country for people to sit on and talk about what Canada means to them while being filmed. Neither has been as divisive as the duck.\u201cThe couch is actually a very symbolic element for Canadians\u2019 lives,\u201d said Ela Kinowska, project manager for the Red Couch Tour. \u201cThey do a lot on couches, like watching hockey, arguing and loving each other.\u201dAdding to the tension is a dispute about the duck\u2019s origins.A different giant duck has bobbed into harbors from Hong Kong to Amsterdam in recent years to celebrate events, often met with local fanfare. That duck, swimming the world since 2007, was the brainchild of Dutch artist Florentijn Hofman, who offered it as a nonprofit art installation to draw crowds and remind people that the earth\u2019s seas are \u201cour bathtub,\u201d the artist has said.The duck the Canadians rented was built by a couple of Americans who charge up to US$40,000 per appearance, plus the cost of towing between sites.Ryan Whaley, one of the duck\u2019s owners, said he paid Mr. Hofman \u20ac50,000, or about US$57,000, for the duck\u2019s design in 2014. He said the plans they received were unusable so they had to design their own, arguing the duck\u2019s design has been in the public domain since the 1930s and can\u2019t be copyrighted.\u201cYou can find that same duck design way before anyone of us was alive,\u201d said Mr. Whaley.Mr. Hofman said he didn\u2019t receive the money and that Mr. Whaley\u2019s duck violates a copyright he has filed in the U.S.The Dutch artist said he would have welcomed the opportunity to design a more appropriate giant sculpture in honor of Canada\u2019s big day. \u201cCanadians are really laid back,\u201d he said. \u201cThey deserved a better symbol for their 150 years.\u201dThe dispute has put the Ontario officials who signed off on the duck in the hot seat. They in turn have accused critics and opposition politicians of trying to pour cold water on the festival.Eleanor McMahon, the province\u2019s tourism minister, argued during a recent legislature debate that the festival will prove to be a big tourism draw and generate millions for Toronto\u2019s economy, to little avail.\u201cMy department did not fund this duck,\u201d Canadian Heritage Minister       Melanie Joly       told lawmakers in the federal Parliament, after being hit with queries from her political opponents about the Liberal government\u2019s role in the duck rental.\u201cAmerica, I know your politics are stressful right now but we in Canada can relate,\u201d tweeted Canadian political scientist Paul Fairie. \u201cWe may have inadvertently rented a plagiarized duck.\u201dCorrections & Amplifications   The surname of Aaron Wudrick, federal director of the Canadian Taxpayers Federation, was misspelled in an earlier version of this article.

His attempts at a third act never quite got off the ground.He suffered the curse of entrepreneurs who find spectacular early success: a conviction that they can do as well in any other field. He also was caught up in the 1980s binge of takeovers fueled by Wall Street\u2019s passion for junk bonds and quest for fees. Timidity was never his problem.\u201cEntrepreneurship demands taking risks for gains, and I have done that all my life,\u201d he said in 1988, less than two years before his retailing empire collapsed. \u201cI like to take risks.\u201dMr. Campeau died June 12 at his home in Ottawa. He was 93.In the late 1980s, he was briefly America\u2019s largest department-store retailer after buying             Federated Department Stores Inc.       in what Fortune magazine later called the \u201clooniest deal ever.\u201d At one reception in that giddy era, Paul Anka sang a tribute to the French Canadian mogul with words set to \u201cMy Way\u201d: \u201cIs he extraordinaire? Bet your derri\u00e8re. But he did it his way.\u201dRead a collection of in-depth profiles at WSJ.com/Obituaries.Robert Joseph Antoine Campeau was born Aug 3, 1923, near the northern Ontario town of Sudbury. The son of an auto mechanic, he dropped out of school at age 14 and used a dead brother\u2019s baptismal papers to appear old enough for employment. His early jobs included sweeping floors in a factory, driving trucks, running a corner store and working as a construction laborer.He began building one modest house at a time and soon established himself as a major home builder in the suburbs of Ottawa in the 1950s. By requiring carpenters to redo any work he saw as slipshod, he earned a reputation for quality. Soon he branched into building office towers, hotels and other commercial projects in Ottawa, Toronto and the U.S.Mr. Campeau kept thinking on a grander scale. In 1980, his Campeau Corp. announced a takeover bid for the far-larger Royal Trustco Ltd., a financial-services company, whose chairman, Kenneth White, promptly declared: \u201cI will not work for Robert Campeau.\u201d Mr. White managed to thwart the bid, and Mr. Campeau sank into one of his periodic spells of despair.\u201cI was confused about my future,\u201d he said later. \u201cI did a lot of soul-searching. It wasn\u2019t too easy.\u201dHe talked of acquiring an oil company or U.S. financial-services concern before settling on U.S. department stores. In 1986, he overcame initial opposition from Allied Stores Corp. by snapping up large blocks of its stock on the open market. He acquired Allied, the owner of such store chains as Brooks Brothers and Ann Taylor, for about $3.7 billion.Two years later, he acquired Federated for $6.6 billion, up from an initial bid of $4.2 billion, with financial support from the Reichmann family of Toronto, junk-bond investors and banks in North America and Japan. The deal drenched Mr. Campeau\u2019s retailing empire in debt, requiring him to sell some of its assets quickly at a time when retail sales were sluggish.As junk-bond investors grew skittish, cash flow from the stores proved insufficient to meet interest on the debt. After closing stores and laying off thousands of workers, Federated and Allied filed for bankruptcy-court protection in 1990. The board of Mr. Campeau\u2019s company stripped him of his role as chairman and CEO.Allen Finkelson, a lawyer who advised Mr. Campeau on his takeovers, said he believed the entrepreneur could have succeeded in retailing had he stopped buying after the Allied deal. But Mr. Campeau was impatient by nature. Mr. Finkelson recalled receiving phone calls from Mr. Campeau as early as 4 a.m. to discuss his latest ideas.After losing his company, Mr. Campeau spent years in legal battles with his estranged second wife, Ilse, over their former homes, artworks and other assets. Those included a home resembling a French castle, with 17 bathrooms and an Olympic-size indoor pool, in Toronto\u2019s Bridle Path neighborhood and a turreted palace in Austria, with only seven bathrooms.Mr. Campeau resurfaced in the mid-1990s with plans to build thousands of homes in Teltow, a German town near Berlin. \u201cMost people don\u2019t go through what he did and come back swinging,\u201d his son Daniel said at the time. \u201cBut if he didn\u2019t do this he would be dead. There\u2019s nothing in between for a guy like this. All he does is shoot big.\u201dHe boarded a bulldozer to signal the planned start of construction and told reporters: \u201cWe are going to build the best project ever built in Europe and in North America.\u201dWithin a couple of years, he abandoned the project. Local politicians say that Mr. Campeau got into disputes with his lenders and underestimated German bureaucratic hurdles. On a less ambitious scale, other developers now are building homes on the site. Mr. Campeau\u2019s legacy survives in the form of a few streets with names evoking his homeland, including Kanada-Allee.He moved back to Ottawa. When the Globe and Mail interviewed him in 2005, he was living modestly in a rented townhouse.A family death notice said he was survived by his third wife, Christel, a former member of the Teltow town council.

His buddy coached Central Connecticut, and Mr. DiCicco wanted to show his support.An attacking player on the Monmouth soccer team named Christie Pearce caught his eye. When she found the net on consecutive breakaways, Mr. DiCicco made a note. Ms. Pearce was raw. She had few foot skills and little understanding of soccer, but she was much faster than everyone else and she had that unteachable streak of aggression.A few weeks later, Mr. DiCicco invited Ms. Pearce, then the captain of the school\u2019s basketball team, to a training camp for the U.S. women\u2019s soccer team.Christie Pearce, who later became Christie Rampone, went on to play with the women\u2019s national team for the next two decades, as it won two Olympic gold medals and two World Cups. Her rise from obscurity\u2014thanks to the instincts of the coach who led the team to its Zeitgeist-changing triumph in the 1999 World Cup\u2014is emblematic of the way Mr. DiCicco went about his work.Mr. DiCicco died of cancer June 19 at his home in Connecticut.\u00a0He was 68.His work, and specifically that triumph of the U.S. women in 1999, changed the sports landscape and the athletic career prospects for women in the U.S.Before that match against China\u2014in front of 90,000 fans in the Rose Bowl Stadium\u2014few believed anyone would pay attention to a women\u2019s sports competition that didn\u2019t involve figure skates, a tennis racket or a gymnastics mat. After the match, which drew the second-largest television audience ever to watch a soccer game in the U.S., media executives and the advertising world knew they had a new collection of stars to attract eyeballs and hawk their wares like never before.Read a collection of in-depth profiles at WSJ.com/Obituaries.Mr. DiCicco always gave the credit to the women on the field, but they were women he selected, who played the game the way he thought they should. He never had much patience for coaches and self-appointed aficionados who insisted U.S. women needed to learn the touch, panache and game smarts of Europeans who grew up with the sport.Mr. DiCicco knew that the U.S., thanks to the landmark 1972 civil-rights legislation known as Title Nine, which guaranteed equal access to sports, had spawned an ascendant generation of fast, strong and aggressive American women. He reasoned the only way for the U.S. women to win the World Cup was to out-hustle and out-muscle the competition. They did.Anthony D. DiCicco was born Aug. 5, 1948, in Hartford and grew up largely in Wethersfield, Conn. His father operated an auto repair business, and his mother worked at a manufacturing company.A top athlete in high school, he was a star goalkeeper at Springfield College, where he earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in physical education in 1970. He spent several years playing semi-pro soccer in the American Soccer League and was a member of the U.S. men\u2019s national team in 1973. He earned a master\u2019s degree in physical education from Central Connecticut State University in 1978.After his playing career ended, Mr. DiCicco climbed U.S. soccer\u2019s coaching ranks, working with youth national teams, and serving as goalkeeper coach for the World Cup-winning U.S. women\u2019s side in 1991. When Anson Dorrance quit as head coach in 1994, Mr. DiCicco got the top job and held it until 1999.He led the U.S. women to the Olympic gold medal in 1996 and the World Cup in 1999.\u00a0He is the winningest coach in U.S. soccer history by winning percentages and the only coach to win more than 100 games. In recent years he worked as a television analyst and served as a top commentator for Fox Sports during its 2015 Women\u2019s World Cup coverage.Direct, occasionally gruff, but always respectful, Mr. DiCicco worked his players hard but steered clear of yelling or harsh criticism. He pushed players such as Christie Pearce Rampone to focus on who they could be, rather than who they weren\u2019t.It didn\u2019t matter that her top sport was basketball, or that she was completely unknown in soccer circles, could barely juggle a soccer ball, or even name a single national player other than star Mia Hamm. She had even packed her own practice clothes and laundry detergent before that first training camp, not realizing the team supplied practice uniforms.Some saw her and the U.S. women as a gamble. But Mr. DiCicco knew how to turn Ms. Pearce and her team into a safe bet. It paid off, wildly, for him and for a generation of women athletes who would follow.Mr. DiCicco is survived by his wife, Diane, and four sons.Write to Matthew Futterman at matthew.futterman@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-30 10:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/tony-dicicco-saw-big-potential-for-womens-sports-when-few-others-did-1498833000", "news_title": "Tony DiCicco Saw Big Potential for Women\u2019s Sports When Few Others Did", "keywords": "tony dicicco,tony dicicco obituary,soccer,sports,recreation,obituaries,routine general news"}, {"content": "When bankers got carried away with expense accounts and risky lending,       Frank Cahouet\u2019s       job was to clean up the mess.His toughest challenge came in 1987, when Mellon Bank Corp. recruited him as the first outsider to serve as chairman and chief executive. Pittsburgh-based Mellon, established in 1869, was by then suffering heavy losses on loans related to energy, real estate and Latin America. \u201cI was truly scared,\u201d he said later. \u201cHad the company been drifting too long and could you move it out of this lethargy?\u201dHe startled new colleagues by announcing that an initial recovery plan was due within a week. Eventually, the cure involved shuffling bad loans into a separate company and buying managers of mutual funds and other fee-generating businesses.Mr. Cahouet (pronounced COW-et) eliminated 3,700 jobs, or 18% of the workforce, within a year. He held 7:30 a.m. staff meetings and clamped down on travel and office-supply costs.His style, he said, was \u201cto drive for conclusions, to be intolerant of people who are not really trying their hardest, and to be impolite where necessary.\u201d Through a 2007 merger, Mellon became part of today\u2019s             Bank of New York Mellon Corp.Read a collection of in-depth profiles at WSJ.com/Obituaries.Mr. Cahouet died June 20 at his home in Sewickley Heights, Pa., June 20. He was 85 and had Parkinson\u2019s disease.\u201cHe wasn\u2019t just a cost-cutter,\u201d said Ira Gumberg, a former Mellon director. \u201cHe understood what it was to build a business.\u201dFrank Vondell Cahouet was born May 25, 1932, in Cohasset, Mass., the fourth of five children. His father, a lawyer, died when Frank was a teenager. He found railroad and truck-driving jobs to help pay for his education. After earning an undergraduate degree at Harvard University, where he studied history, he earned master\u2019s in finance at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School.He worked at Security Pacific Corp., a Los Angeles-based bank holding company, for 24 years, including four years in London, and rose to chief financial officer. In 1984, London-based Midland Bank PLC tapped him to head the banking unit of its 57%-owned Crocker National Corp. in San Francisco. Crocker was beset with losses on loans to developers of luxury apartments and town homes in Southern California.Shortly after joining Crocker, he told the New York Times: \u201cI told my people that there could be no submerging of problems, that everything would have to be brought to the surface. To submerge problems would be the greatest sin of all.\u201dTwo years after recruiting him, Midland agreed to sell Crocker to             Wells Fargo                   & Co. That left Mr. Cahouet available for a new job. Fannie Mae hired him as president of the U.S. government-backed mortgage company, and he expected to rise to CEO within a couple of years.\u201cIt was a pretty good life,\u201d he said later of his time at Fannie Mae. A driver was assigned to ferry him around, and he found himself courted by Wall Street bankers and Washington hostesses.That glamorous interlude ended abruptly about nine months later when Mellon lured him to Pittsburgh.Mellon\u2019s culture was in for a shock. Mr. Cahouet brought in some of the bank executives he had worked with in California, a crowd Mellon old-timers dubbed \u201cthe Beach Boys.\u201d The new boss arrived at his desk around 6 a.m. and expected rapid results. For a time, he banned new orders of office supplies; bankers learned to scrounge through the desks of departed colleagues for staplers and paper clips.\u201cOn certain issues, you\u2019ve got to go all the way down to the bottom,\u201d Mr. Cahouet told The Wall Street Journal.To diversify its income and tap into the growth of mutual funds, Mellon acquired two money-management firms, Boston Co. and Dreyfus Corp. Some star fund managers at Boston Co. defected after complaining of what they saw as needless interference from Pittsburgh. Mr. Cahouet said the departures hurt but called it \u201ca very manageable episode.\u201dHe also invested in retail banking and in the custody business, overseeing trade processing, internal accounting, fund administration and other services for financial firms and government entities.Mr. Cahouet retired from Mellon in 1998 and later was chairman of National Bank Holdings Corp., an owner of community banks. Much of his time went to Roman Catholic charities. He and his wife, Ann Walsh Cahouet, set up a family foundation and encouraged their children to use it to address local causes. \u201cHe had no interest in creating trust fund babies,\u201d said his daughter Ann.He is survived by his wife of nearly 61 years, four children and six grandchildren.After being diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s, he told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette: \u201cIt\u2019s a tough deal.

For around $5 a month, users in the U.S., U.K. and about 200 other countries gain access to 11 million songs, most of them Bollywood tunes and other Indian music. Users in India can pay 99 rupees (about $1.54) a month for an ad-free \u201cpro\u201d option.The service also offers music from 10 artists it has signed directly to record label-style deals, along with 30 talk shows.The co-founder and chief executive of New York-based Saavn,       Rishi Malhotra,        said the company is on track this year for revenue of $18 million to $20 million\u2014four times what it garnered three years ago\u2014with 70% coming from subscription fees. Three million of its users are in subscription-only markets.Those numbers are tiny compared to industry leader Spotify AB, which recently said it had 140 million active users, 50 million of them paying subscribers, and reported more than $3.3 billion in revenue for 2016, on which it lost nearly $612 million. Internet-radio giant             Pandora Media Inc.       has been awash in red ink since its debut as a public company six years ago.Most other major subscription services are part of tech giants including             Apple Inc.,Alphabet Inc.       and             Amazon.com Inc.,       which don\u2019t break out financials for their subscription services. But many people in the music industry believe they also lose money, since their business models tend to resemble Spotify\u2019s, including high costs for licensing, marketing, data hosting and streaming.Mr. Malhotra, a former HBO executive, said Saavn\u2019s specialized focus and the unusual financial arrangements that come with it are vital to its relatively rapid path to profits. The company spends only about 40% of revenue on licensing music, compared to about 70% paid by bigger services.Apple Music and Google Music both have presences in India, but Spotify doesn\u2019t.With a vast population and a highly fragmented music industry, India represents both a challenge and opportunity for music companies trying to figure out how to do business there.Guy Oseary,        the manager for Madonna and U2 and an investor in Saavn, said he has long had his eye on the nation but never booked a show there. Until he met Mr. Malhotra, Mr. Oseary recalls, \u201cI hadn\u2019t met anyone who could actually help me figure out how to do any work there.\u201dMarc Geiger,        an investor in Saavn who separately heads the music department at the WME talent agency, said, \u201cThese guys are incredibly well positioned because they\u2019re a market leader in a ginormous market.\u201dThe company, which began as South Asian Audio Video Network, has been streaming music for six years. It has about 190 employees, in the U.S. and India.Spotify\u2019s future also could include black ink.Ahead of a planned public stock offering late this year or early next year, the company recently negotiated new licensing deals with two major music suppliers\u2014            Vivendi SA\u2019s       Universal Music Group and Merlin, a trade group for independent labels\u2014on terms music industry experts believe will improve its operating margins by, among other things, lowering royalty rates. Spotify is pursuing similar terms with             Sony Corp.\u2019s       Sony Music and Access Industries\u2019 Warner Music Group, say people familiar with the matter.As the biggest services gain subscribers, Mr. Geiger is bullish on streaming in general. \u201cPeople see a path to profitability,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was always about gaining users.\u201dCorrections & Amplifications   Marc Geiger is the head of the music department at the WME/IMG talent agency.

The other\u2019s Paul Sherwen.But everyone knows them as Paul & Phil. Or Phil & Paul, if you prefer.For more than three decades, the two Brits have been calling the Tour de France and other races for television audiences in the U.S. (on NBC Sports Network) and around the world. When the 104th edition of the Tour kicks off on Saturday, July 1, it will be Liggett\u2019s 45th in a row without interruption. For Sherwen, it will be his 39th\u2014he missed one in 1983. But seven of those 39 Tours Sherwen started as a pro racer, so there\u2019s that.There\u2019s no tandem quite like Paul & Phil in sports TV, especially in the U.S., where even the best commentators stick closely to the action. By contrast, Liggett and Sherwen are on the air live for three weeks straight, for several hours per day, and while there\u2019s excitement, there\u2019s plenty of tedium, too. So in addition to the race leaders, Paul & Phil might take a moment to discuss a castle, a church, herd of cows, or the abundant gorgeousness of the French countryside. (Imagine Al Michaels and Cris Collinsworth talking lyrically and knowledgeably about the flora and fauna in the Meadowlands, and you get the idea.)Meanwhile, the Tour TV audience ranges from legit racers (who may know everything) to weekend warriors (who think they know everything) to newcomers who are watching their first bike race, ever.\u201cIt\u2019s amazing the number of people who come up to us who are not cyclists, and really enjoy the Tour de France,\u201d says Sherwen. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like a soap. It\u2019s something people get hooked onto.\u201dCycling has endured plenty of crises along with its high points, and Liggett and Sherwen have carried on through it all. They have their critics, including those who feel they\u2019ve been too cozy and too soft on drug scandalized competitors like       Lance Armstrong.       Among certain cycling crowds, it is cool to say you don\u2019t tune to Paul & Phil anymore, and prefer an outlet, like, say, Eurosport.But their place is undeniable. Liggett and Sherwen are an institution. For many, the mellifluous melody and harmony of Paul & Phil is the soundtrack of cycling.\u201cPeople will come up and say, \u2018You\u2019ve been commentating since my son was 11 years of age\u2014he\u2019s now 51,\u2019\u201d says Liggett. \u201cI\u2019ll go, \u2018Thanks a lot. I feel great now.\u2019\u201dOver the years, some of Liggett and Sherwen\u2019s poetic commentary have become part of the sport\u2019s vernacular, catchphrases used by recreational riders out on weekend spins. Some of Liggett\u2019s most famous \u201cLiggetisms\u201d include:\u201cHe\u2019s dancing on the pedals!\u201d (When a cyclist is riding almost effortlessly.)\u201cHe\u2019s digging deep into his suitcase of courage!\u201d (When a rider is showing great effort, especially in the mountains.)\u201cThe elastic is about to snap!\u201d (When a pack of riders are on the verge of being torn apart by a difficult section.)Liggett and Sherwen were first paired in 1986\u2014before that, Liggett\u2019s partners included John Tesh, the musician and former host of Entertainment Tonight. They\u2019ve worked together for so long, they joke they\u2019re like an old married couple. (\u201cWe\u2019d have made a perfect man and wife, really, but that wasn\u2019t to be,\u201d says Liggett.) Both men hail from northwest England\u2014Liggett a young racer who migrated into sports journalism; Sherwen a professional who raced with teams including Raleigh\u2014and they share a droll sense of humor. \u201cPeople from the northwest, and especially Liverpool, have a very quick humor,\u201d says Sherwen. \u201cIt\u2019s something that probably brought us together quite quickly.\u201d They each keep homes in Africa (Sherwen resides in Kampala, Uganda; Liggett is primarily in the U.K. but also has a home not far from South Africa\u2019s Kruger National Park). When they\u2019re not calling races, they\u2019re often advocating for environmental and animal causes, like rhinoceros preservation.During the Tour, Paul & Phil are basically together for all of their waking hours. The race is an endurance grind even for journalists; there are long, winding drives between stages almost every night. Proud Brits, Paul & Phil drive a car with the steering wheel on the right side, even if the French road system is in the opposite orientation. (Paul actually does all of the driving; pre-GPS, Phil navigated with a stack of maps.) In 1992, they were among a handful of Tour journalists who lost their cars in an explosion police attributed to an incendiary device they suspected was placed by Basque separatists.\u201cPhil was quite happy, because my CD collection got blown up,\u201d says Sherwen.That long nighttime drive serves as Paul & Phil\u2019s pre-production meeting for the next day\u2019s stage. Perhaps unbeknownst to them, it\u2019s also a race itself. Christian Vande Velde, an American rider who now partners with them in the booth, says that he and his fellow NBC colleague Bob Roll\u2019s only goal through the Tour is to beat Paul & Phil on the drive to the hotel, even when Paul & Phil leave early.\u201cIt fills us with everlasting joy,\u201d Vande Velde says. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing like flipping the elders the bird as you fly by them at 180 kilometers per hour.\u201dBy the time Paul & Phil pull in, the hotel restaurant is almost always closed for the night. \u201cIf they leave us out a cold plate of food, brilliant,\u201d says Liggett. \u201cAnd a bottle of wine, in my case.\u201d (Phil likes a good French red, plus Montrachets and Sancerres.) When the sun rises, Phil will knock on Paul\u2019s door for a morning cup. \u201cHe makes the coffee,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause he brings it from Uganda.\u201dJens Voigt, the retired racer from Germany who is now part of NBC\u2019s team, marvels at the stamina of Paul & Phil. \u201cWhen I turn over to the other side of the bed and fall asleep again, they\u2019re already up,\u201d says a man who not long ago held cycling\u2019s hour record.Voigt, who is wildly popular with American cycling fans, attributes much of his cycling notoriety to the way Liggett and Sherwen would rhapsodize about his efforts during races. During his career, Voigt was known as a daring breakaway artist who would often launch valiant if doomed attacks. He quickly became a Paul & Phil favorite.\u201cI believe half of my popularity is thanks to them,\u201d says Voigt.A particular challenge to televising a bike race is that the commentators are almost never in the same location as the race itself. While the peloton is snaking through the Alps, Liggett and Sherwen will be in a booth at the finish line\u2014they won\u2019t see the riders in person until the end. Instead, they\u2019re calling the action off a video feed they can\u2019t control. It requires dexterity\u2014as Liggett speaks, the French-speaking Sherwen will monitor the official race radio. There are invariably technical difficulties and confusion, riders who get misidentified and so on\u2014but it\u2019s impressive how generally seamless a duo they are.\u201cI can\u2019t think of a more difficult sport to call minute-by-minute than a bicycle race,\u201d says David Michaels, a coordinating producer for the NBC Sports Group who oversees Tour coverage. His NBC producing colleague, Joel Felicio, says Paul & Phil are recognized everywhere on the route: \u201cThey\u2019re rock stars.\u201dBy now, of course, much of cycling\u2019s history has been rewritten by scandal. Many of the champions Paul & Phil once hailed on live TV were later exposed for doping, none bigger than Armstrong. Liggett describes this as cycling\u2019s \u201cdark period,\u201d but says he won\u2019t totally decry Armstrong, maintaining that drugs were rife during the period, and pointing out that none of Armstrong\u2019s stripped Tour yellow jerseys have been awarded to a runner-up. He still sounds torn between the image of Armstrong the champion\u2014an image TV helped burnish\u2014and the Armstrong since humbled by a fall from grace.\u201cI presented him with many awards, and I saw how people idolized him,\u201d Liggett says. \u201cSome feel cheated, for sure.\u201dWhile they believe it\u2019s cleaned up a lot, Paul & Phil sound conflicted about bike racing today. They\u2019re thrilled by the Slovak world champion Peter Sagan, calling him a throwback to the charismatic, impulsive riding style of legend Eddy Merckx. They\u2019re less enthused by the rise of data-driven strategy in races like the Tour, where riders will rely on-board numbers like wattage (which measures how much effort a rider is putting out) to plan their attacks and responses. \u201cA lot of the guys nowadays are very much like metronomes, or robots,\u201d says Sherwen.\u201cFor me, I can\u2019t get any excitement at all in knowing this guy can pump 600 watts,\u201d says Liggett. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean a thing to me. I just want to see him win this race, and use his heart and his courage to do it.\u201dThen again, cycling is cycling, and crazy always happens, as it did last year, when eventual race winner Chris Froome crashed his bike and wound up trying to run up the mountain to a stage finish in a madcap scene that resembled a       Will Ferrell       movie.\u201cThat\u2019s why the Tour is such a special thing,\u201d says Sherwen. \u201cIt\u2019s not sterile, and it\u2019s not in a stadium, or a tennis court. You\u2019re always likely to get something strange. Froome running up Mont Ventoux with his cycling shoes on \u2014 neither of us had seen that before.\u201dA new Tour de France is here, and crazy is bound to occur in the coming weeks. That\u2019s why I watch. If not, there\u2019s always the beautiful French countryside, those castles, those churches, those farm animals, and, as always, Paul & Phil.Write to Jason Gay at Jason.Gay@wsj.comAppeared in the July 1, 2017, print edition as 'Paul & Phil: Tour\u2019s Everlasting Pair.'", "news_time": "2017-06-30 10:13:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/paul-phil-will-make-you-love-the-tour-de-france-1498759126", "news_title": "Paul & Phil Will Make You Love the Tour de France", "keywords": "bike,bikes,cycling,lance armstrong,la tour,paul sherwen,phil liggett,tour de france,political,general news,natural environment,sports,recreation,commentaries,opinions,routine general news"}, {"content": "Ford Motor Co.\u2019s       new chief executive is enforcing a \u201cshot clock\u201d on lingering decisions at the auto maker to implement plans faster and regain competitive footing in vital segments of the car business.CEO Jim Hackett, speaking to analysts this week, rolled out the shot-clock idea\u2014borrowing from a rule employed in basketball to quicken the pace of the game\u2014as part of his agenda for the first 100 days in his new job.Mr. Hackett, who succeeded Mark Fields at the helm in May, spoke Thursday with Wall Street analysts, the first such meeting for Ford\u2019s new chief as he confronts an underperforming stock price.The company has been widely criticized for appearing indecisive on important technology bets, including self-driving cars or electric vehicles.In addition to setting firmer deadlines on decisions, Mr. Hackett said he plans to focus on costs, according to analysts\u2019 reports recounting the event. He also wants to move faster to target weaknesses in the business, such as slumping U.S. sedan sales.Ford and other conventional auto makers are scrambling to counter the automotive ambitions of such tech giants as             Alphabet Inc.,Intel Corp.       and             Apple Inc.,       and electric auto maker             Tesla Inc.       Ford is now investing in autonomous-vehicle research, including taking financial stakes in startups, and is spending more than $4 billion to improve its electric-car lineup. Mr. Hackett signaled an openness to revisit the strategy he inherited from Mr. Fields, the analysts said.The CEO change, coming as Ford\u2019s stock traded about 40% below its level when Mr. Fields became chief in 2014, is seen as an attempt to fix the 114-year-old company\u2019s culture.\u201cMr. Hackett acknowledged that past slow decision-making\u2014sometimes caused by confusion over \u2018who was in charge\u2019 within newer efforts\u2014has been an issue at Ford,\u201d said       Itay Michaeli,        an analyst with             Citigroup.Ford\u2019s new boss also talked about his belief \u201cthat you can have a meeting with just three people in the room,\u201d emphasizing that at times such participation is sufficient to turn a plan into action, and expressed \u201castonishment\u201d at the amount of capital the industry requires,\u00a0            J.P. Morgan                   analyst       Ryan Brinkman       said in a note.Mr. Hackett acknowledged that Ford is trailing in certain areas, such as vehicle connectivity, Mr. Michaeli wrote in a research note.The new CEO pointed to other areas where Ford could be leaner, calling out the human-resources department. He told analysts that the department was \u201cout-sized\u201d relative to the size of the company as a whole, according Mr. Brinkman.A Ford spokesman confirmed the meeting with analysts took place.In emerging technologies, Mr. Hackett appeared to play down the importance of rolling out a fully autonomous vehicle by 2021\u2014a target set by his predecessor\u2014and analysts \u201csensed clear skepticism that Ford somehow \u2018needs\u2019 to partner to access the car of the future,\u201d Mr. Michaeli said.Write to Christina Rogers at christina.rogers@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-30 10:10:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/ford-ceo-decision-making-shot-clock-neededto-accelerate-plans-1498831598", "news_title": "Ford CEO: Decision-Making \u2018Shot Clock\u2019 Needed\u00a0to Accelerate Plans ", "keywords": "car maker,ceo change,new ceo,stock,strategy,Ford Motor,F,Jim Hackett,plans,corporate,industrial news,motor vehicles,passenger cars,automotive"}, {"content": "Health-care regulators are publicly naming the drugs most vulnerable to price gouging. That is a good thing for the pharmaceutical industry.This week, the Food and Drug Administration published a list of dozens of drugs whose patent protection has expired but lack generic competition. In a signal that it is eager to approve fresh competitors, the FDA noted that some of the drugs on its list could be approved without prior discussion with regulators.A generic-drugs trade group, the Association for Accessible Medicines, called the move a \u201ctremendous benefit for our nation\u2019s patients.\u201cThat is true. What is surprising is the added competition the FDA is seeking should help the drug industry overall, even if profits are slightly lower. The reason is that the most heavily criticized pricing abuses have occurred in these drugs. If the FDA\u2019s plan works, there will also be fewer drug executives called in for congressional hearings, which will ease some of the negative attention on the industry.For instance, Daraprim, the Turing Pharmaceuticals drug that helped ignite the drug-pricing firestorm in 2015, appears on the list.\u00a0 So are Cuprimine and Syprine, drugs owned by Valeant Pharmaceuticals International that were the subject of a Senate committee hearing on drug prices last year.The coast isn\u2019t entirely clear for pharma on the regulatory front; new FDA Commissioner       Scott Gottlieb       has floated other policies that could be negative for bigger companies. He has proposed a crackdown on branded drug manufacturers accused of stonewalling generic companies that are trying to access drug samples in order to test their drugs. That could narrow the window in which blockbuster drugs can earn outsize profits.The Trump administration is preparing an executive order on drug pricing, a big wild card. And any changes to the Affordable Care Act could still hammer the drug industry.For its first effort to give patients greater access to medicines, the FDA has produced something to please industry critics and insiders alike.Write to Charley Grant at charles.grant@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-30 10:10:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/drug-industry-should-welcome-this-effort-to-cut-price-1498831820", "news_title": "Drug Industry Should Welcome This Effort to Cut Price   ", "keywords": "drug prices,fda regulations,Food and Drug Administration,regulation,government policy,patents,new products,services,marketing,markets,pricing,new product approvals,corporate,industrial news,intellectual property rights,industrial property rights,commodity,financial market news,pharmaceuticals,health care,life sciences"}, {"content": "Evercore\u00a0Partners Inc.

Children were gravitating toward science fiction and cartoons.So Mr. Galton decided to double down on marketing to devoted Spider-Man and Hulk fans of all ages. He used comic-book stores, a new niche business, and home subscriptions to sell Marvel\u2019s monthly superhero tales.The new distribution model became a blueprint for revitalizing the comic-book business.\u201cEverybody said the direct-sales model was going to destroy the company,\u201d said Joseph Calamari, one of Mr. Galton partners at Marvel. \u201cIt did the opposite. It was the main force of change for the whole comic industry.\u201dMr. Galton died at home in Naples, Fla., on June 12 at the age of 92.He was known as a genial boss whose support for Marvel\u2019s writers and artists matched his ambitions for the superheroes they created. Tom DeFalco, Marvel\u2019s editor in chief beginning in the late 1980s, remembers Mr. Galton finding him with his feet up on his desk, lost in thought. Rather than disturb him, Mr. Galton left a message for Mr. DeFalco to come see him later.\u201cWhen I see you staring at the wall I know I\u2019m getting my money\u2019s worth, because you must be figuring out something important,\u201d Mr. Galton told him.Read a collection of in-depth profiles at WSJ.com/Obituaries.James Edward Goldstein was born Nov. 1, 1924, in Lawrence, N.Y., to Margaret and Montague Goldstein. Margaret was a homemaker. Montague ran a chemical-supply business with his brother-in-law. Margaret and Montague changed their son\u2019s surname to Galton before he applied to college because, at a time of heightened anti-Semitism, they thought it would help him get into school and find a job.Mr. Galton attended Antioch College in Ohio, where he studied business and worked in a munitions factory. After graduating he became a certified public accountant and worked as an auditor before joining Popular Library, a paperback publisher. He worked his way up to become president in 1968.CBS                   acquired the company in the early 1970s. Mr. Galton butted heads with the new owners and was fired.He went back to work for Cadence Industries, the conglomerate that distributed books for Popular Library. He was assigned to audit the company\u2019s eclectic collection of businesses, from vitamins to movie theaters, and uncovered financial impropriety at the unit that published Marvel comics. His bosses asked him to take charge of the division and fix it.\u201cMy friends told me, \u2018The comic industry is dead. Don\u2019t do this,\u2019\u201d Mr. Galton told the Naples Daily News in 2010. \u201cBut I had four kids\u2014two in private school, two in college\u2014and two mortgages. I had to take the job.\u201dSpider-Man and the X-Men, characters created by Marvel artists including master comic-book writer Stan Lee, were already fixtures of the pop-culture firmament. But devotion to the monthly comic books that chronicled their exploits was waning.Mr. Galton made Marvel the pioneer of a new strategy to distribute them through new specialty comic-book stores and monthly subscriptions rather than more general retail outlets. Monthly circulation of Marvel\u2019s dozens of titles skyrocketed.\u201cHe said things were so bad he would have tried anything to make a few bucks, and it ended up changing comics completely,\u201d said Michael Hobson, Marvel\u2019s publisher under Mr. Galton in the late 1980s. \u201cWe were publishing as many comic books as we possibly could.\u201dMr. Galton also dreamed of watching superheroes leap off the page onto TV and movie screens. He started an animation studio in Los Angeles that produced popular cartoons based on G.I. Joe and Transformers, in addition to Peter Parker\u2019s web-flinging alter ego.But getting Marvel\u2019s stars onto the big screen eluded him. Many of Marvel\u2019s most popular characters were tied up in onerous licensing deals struck before he joined the company. The technology to create the computer-generated imagery that has since fueled an explosion in the number of superhero films didn\u2019t mature until a few years after he retired in the 1990s.Walt Disney Co.       acquired Marvel for $4 billion in 2009. Since then, two-dozen films based on Marvel characters have grossed more than $16.7 billion world-wide.\u201cJim and I often dreamed of Marvel\u2019s superheroes being on the big screen and being monster hits,\u201d said Mr. Lee, who is 94 years old. \u201cI have never known a pleasanter, nicer, more honorable man.\u201dA lifelong bibliophile, Mr. Galton was passionate about using comics to get children to read. Under his watch Marvel commissioned public-awareness comics condemning child abuse, and biographies of public figures like Pope John Paul II and Mother Teresa.\u201cHe saw the power in comic books,\u201d said Lydia Galton, his wife of nearly 50 years. \u201cHe understood how strongly they could influence people.\u201dMr. Galton met Lydia, his second wife, on a blind date a friend set up during a ski vacation. He was a fanatic tennis player who realized his dream of building a court at his house in Connecticut as Marvel\u2019s fortunes took off in the 1980s.His own literary tastes ran more toward the heroes of history than fantasy.

BAC 0.67%       shares via warrants at below-market prices, a deal that places the firm as the bank\u2019s largest shareholder.The move was expected after the Charlotte, N.C., bank received permission from the Federal Reserve this week to boost its per-share dividend to 48 cents a year. Mr. Buffett has said a dividend of this size would prompt his company to swap its preferred shares into common stock.When the bank raises its dividend, Berkshire Hathaway will use $5 billion worth of preferred shares to buy 700 million common shares at $7.14 each, well below the current market price of $24.32 and the overall current value of $17.02 billion.\u201cWe appreciate Mr. Buffett\u2019s continued support for the long-term value we are delivering through responsible growth and we welcome his decision,\u201d Bank of America said in a statement.Bank of America shares rose 0.9% in early trading to $24.53. The move would make the famous stock picker\u2019s firm the largest shareholder of the second- and third-largest U.S. banks\u2014the third being             Wells Fargo                   & Co.\u2014while also providing a vote of confidence for Bank of America stock.On Wednesday, as part of the \u201cstress test\u201d process, the Fed approved Bank of America\u2019s plan to pay out the dividend of 48 cents, which represents a 60% increase from the previous level of 30 cents. The regulator also approved the bank\u2019s plans to buy back $12.9 billion worth of shares. Over the past year, the bank got permission to buy back $7.7 billion worth of shares.In February, Mr. Buffett said in his annual letter to shareholders that Berkshire planned to make the switch in its Bank of America stake if the bank could increase its annual dividend to 44 cents a share. That is because a common-stock dividend of 44 cents would pay Berkshire more than the $300 million that the preferred stake gives the firm annually.Berkshire bought its preferred shares in the bank in 2011, when the lender sorely needed to shore up investor sentiment. The $5 billion deal also included warrants to buy 700 million shares of Bank of America common stock for $7.14 apiece.The terms, though, were expensive for Bank of America. The preferred stock paid a chunky 6% annual dividend, or $300 million a year. Bank of America shares have tripled since the investment, from about $7.60 to $23.88, giving Berkshire a paper gain of almost $12 billion. The Omaha, Neb., investor also has made about $1.7 billion in dividends on the preferred shares.The preferred shares have little downside as long as Bank of America stays solvent. But they have no upside either. With a change in Berkshire\u2019s shares, Mr. Buffett effectively would be saying that he would like to take part in possible gains on Bank of America\u2019s stock while still enjoying a steady dividend.After an exchange, Mr. Buffett\u2019s firm would own about 7% of the bank\u2019s common shares, giving it a significant role in corporate-governance issues from compensation to the election of new directors. Currently, the largest shareholder of Bank of America is Vanguard Group with 652.4 million shares, or a 6.6% stake, according to FactSet.Before his February letter, Mr. Buffett had said he would wait to exercise the warrants, which expire in 2021.Mr. Buffett, Berkshire\u2019s chairman and CEO, amassed stakes in a number of lenders and financial-services companies, sometimes at cut-rate prices around the financial crisis. Berkshire\u2019s other bank holdings as of March 31 included Wells Fargo,             Bank of New York Mellon Corp.      ,             American Express Co.      ,             Goldman Sachs Group Inc.,M&T Bank Corp.       and             U.S. Bancorp.Bank of America shares are up about 83% over the past 12 months in large part because of a big rally right after the November election. But one issue for the bank is that profit gains from higher interest rates have slowed as long-term rates have remained low.Big banks need approval from the Fed to increase their dividends, a process that culminated in Wednesday\u2019s annual review of how the lenders would perform under severely stressed economic conditions. This is the second year in a row that Bank of America has gotten permission to increase both its dividend and buybacks. In the early years of the test, the bank struggled to get a clean approval for such capital-return hikes from the regulator.The dividend and buyback boosts are positive for Bank of America Chairman and CEO       Brian Moynihan.       The 57-year-old lawyer has worked to restore the bank\u2019s relationships with shareholders after years of large mortgage fines and losses stemming from the bank\u2019s crisis-era purchases of Countrywide and Merrill Lynch.\u2014Austen Hufford contributed to this article.Corrections & Amplifications   Berkshire Hathaway said Friday that it would buy 700 million Bank of America shares via warrants.

The program, which will make it easier for foreign investors to invest in China\u2019s $9 trillion bond market, was approved by China\u2019s central bank in May.The new trading link follows last year\u2019s landmark opening of China\u2019s bond market to global investors with trading accounts inside China. With the bond connect program, the market will open to foreign investors with trading accounts in Hong Kong too.The connection will be one-way, however: Foreigners will be able to buy bonds in the mainland market, but Chinese investors won\u2019t be able to do likewise in Hong Kong. Its launch comes as China has been fighting a battle to stem capital outflows and reduce downward pressure on its currency.\u201cThe fact that only the northbound channel is open for now means it\u2019s more about attracting foreign investors into China,\u201d said Zang Min, senior fixed income analyst at Hongxin Securities.The bond connect program is modeled in part on the stock-market links between Hong Kong and China\u2019s exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen, although they permit two-way investment flows.Although foreign investors have expressed growing interest in investing in Chinese bonds, that hasn\u2019t translated into a rush of overseas money into the market to date.Even after the People\u2019s Bank of China allowed free access for global investors to the bond market last year, their share in the market remains low. At the end of March, the total amount of Chinese domestic bonds held by foreign investors was around 830 billion yuan ($122.42 billion), or around 1.4% of the market, according to             Goldman Sachs.Among the more than 100 foreign investors who have so far registered with regulators to use the bond connect program \u201cmany carry the DNA of Chinese money,\u201d said one of the people familiar with the matter, referring to overseas branches of Chinese companies or funds.Among the reasons behind global investors\u2019 reluctance to pile into Chinese bonds is their absence from major global bond indexes that are tracked by passively-managed funds, such as the one compiled by Citibank. Goldman Sachs estimates that once China\u2019s bond market is included in such indexes, it could lead up to $250 billion of extra foreign capital into China, as global money managers allocate their bondholdings based on the composition of such indexes.A lack of diversity among investors, regular turmoil in the market and various forms of price anomalies in China\u2019s bond market has also made foreign investors hesitant. Chinese banks, which are mostly state-owned and tend to share similar trading strategies, are estimated to account for around two-thirds of the bond market\u2019s trading volume.The market has suffered several selloffs in the past few months, ranging from one caused by a fraud-related trading scandal by a midsize Chinese brokerage in December to a regulatory crackdown on leveraged investment in April and May. China\u2019s domestic credit rating system, in which the vast majority of corporate bond issuers enjoy a high AAA grade, has also been criticized for being overly generous.China\u2019s bond market has expanded ninefold in the past decade, as Beijing has looked to encourage companies to use bonds and stocks to raise funds and reduce the pressure on an overstretched banking sector.The effort has yet to achieve significant breakthroughs as corporate bonds account for only 12% of the entire market, while government and policy bank bonds take up a combined 80% share.The launch of the new trading platform next week will come after several days during which Hong Kong has been marking the 20th anniversary of the handover of the former British colony to Beijing. Chinese President       Xi Jinping       flew into the city Thursday for an official visit.Hongxin\u2019s Mr. Zang said the bond connect link could be seen as a \u201clittle gift\u201d from Beijing to Hong Kong, as it could boost income for banks based in the city as foreign investors open trading accounts there.But for some investors, the benefits of the new program appears limited.Ashley Perrott, head of pan-Asian fixed income at UBS Asset Management in Singapore, said he isn\u2019t planning on using the bond connect just yet since he can already buy Chinese bonds through existing programs.\u201cBond connect is another useful addition to the whole tool kit for access\u2026 Does it offer something different than what we already have? Not majorly,\u201d Mr. Perrott said.China Development Bank and the Agricultural Development Bank of China, two of the country\u2019s three policy lenders, will issue new bonds that can be bought by both domestic and foreign investors under bond connect early next week, according to two of the people familiar with the matter. Four Chinese companies are also expected to issue bonds following the launch, they added.\u2014Gregor Stuart Hunter and Saumya Vaishampayan contributed to this article.Write to Shen Hong at

Chinese counterpart for the second time, Beijing accused the U.S. of violating the \u201cspirit\u201d of their first meeting by approving arms sales to Taiwan and unilaterally sanctioning Chinese entities linked to North Korea.China lodged formal diplomatic protests over the $1.42 billion arms sale, even as preparations were under way for President       Xi Jinping\u2019s       bilateral meetings at the Group of 20 summit in Hamburg, Germany, next week, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said.The spokesman,       Lu Kang,        said the weapons transfer and other U.S. \u201cwrongdoings,\u201d including sanctions on Chinese entities, were inconsistent with progress made at the two leaders\u2019 first meeting at Mr. Trump\u2019s Florida resort, Mar-a-Lago, in April.\u201cWe hope that the U.S. administration can correct its mistakes, so that China-U.S. relations can get back on a healthy and stable track,\u201d he told a regular news briefing.The Trump administration said Thursday that it had approved the weapons sale to Taiwan\u2014first under President Trump\u2014and sanctioned four Chinese entities, including a bank it said helped Pyongyang access the U.S. financial system.The moves suggest a hardening of the Trump\u2019s administration\u2019s approach to China following a gradual improvement in bilateral relations since the Mar-a-Lago summit, analysts and diplomats say.U.S. officials say they have been disappointed in the past month by China\u2019s response to their appeals for Beijing to use its economic leverage to help prevent North Korea from developing a nuclear missile capable of hitting the continental U.S.In targeting the Bank of Dandong, the new sanctions represent an escalation in Washington\u2019s efforts to target Chinese entities that do business with North Korea.Based in the city of Dandong, overlooking the Yalu River that forms the border with North Korea, the bank is one of China\u2019s smaller ones: KPMG, the accounting firm, ranked it as 124th among China\u2019s top 200 banks, based on assets, in 2015.But it serves as a key conduit for North Korea to access the U.S. and international financial systems, facilitating millions of dollars of transactions for companies involved in Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear weapons and missile programs, according to the U.S. Treasury Department.The Treasury said an estimated 17% of its transactions processed through its U.S. correspondent accounts during a three-year period involved companies that have done business with or on behalf of sanctioned North Korean entities.Emails and telephone calls to the bank went unanswered Friday.An arms sale to Taiwan was widely expected early in the Trump administration, as the U.S. is legally obliged to sell the island defensive weapons. The Obama administration approved a similar transfer in 2015.China, which sees Taiwan as part of its territory, is always angered when the sales are announced and will be especially concerned this time, given Mr. Trump\u2019s earlier indications that he would pursue closer ties with Taipei.As president-elect, Mr. Trump broke with protocol in December by accepting a congratulatory phone call from Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen. In a January interview with The Wall Street Journal, he then suggested he would review the \u201cOne China\u201d policy that requires the U.S. to forgo official recognition of Taipei.The next month, he reaffirmed the U.S.\u2019s commitment to the policy in a phone call with President Xi that laid the ground for the Mar-a-Lago summit. In the past week, however, there have been fresh signals of warming U.S. ties with Taiwan, with a U.S. Senate panel approving a bill that would allow U.S. Navy vessels to make regular port visits to the island.The U.S. moves come at a politically sensitive time for President Xi, who is presiding over celebrations marking the 20th anniversary of the end of British colonial rule in Hong Kong\u2014another potential trouble spot on the Chinese periphery.Asked if Mr. Xi\u2019s meeting with President Trump in Hamburg might be canceled as a result of the arms sale, Mr. Lu, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, only repeated an earlier statement that Mr. Xi\u2019s bilateral meetings were still being coordinated.Mr. Lu also reiterated China\u2019s longstanding opposition to the U.S. exercising its domestic law beyond its borders through unilateral sanctions.\u201cWe prefer to go through the U.N. Security Council,\u201d he said. \u201cWe urge the U.S. side to stop their wrongdoing on this issue to avoid any effect on other cooperation.\u201d\u2014Lilian Lin and Fanfan Wang contributed to this article.Write to Jeremy Page at jeremy.page@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-30 09:37:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-lodges-protests-over-u-s-arms-sales-to-taiwan-1498829834", "news_title": "China Lodges Protests Over U.S. Arms Sales to Taiwan ", "keywords": "china government,china sanctions,china u.s. relations,donald trump,north korea,taiwan arms sales,xi jinping,Xi Jinping,Donald Trump,political,general news,international relations,international sanctions,politics,domestic politics,banking,credit,financial services"}, {"content": "Zealots in our time have spilled enough blood in the name of religion that some authors\u2014for instance, the late       Christopher Hitchens       in \u201cGod Is Not Great\u201d\u2014have blamed religious feeling itself for evil deeds. But a flood of recent research has shown how faith strengthens resilience to stress, including illness. A new study extends that research to Mexican immigrants in the U.S.Strikingly, many of these studies on faith have come out over the past few years. Some are U.S.-based: Research published in May found that among over 5,000 American adults, regular churchgoers had better physiological stress measures and lower mortality. The Black Women\u2019s Health Study reported in April that it had found a similar mortality benefit among 36,600 women. A 2015 article on 32,000 cancer patients found better physical health in those with greater religion and spirituality.The effects transcend borders and particular religions. Among 37,000 patients in Japan, the more religious had fewer cardiovascular risk factors and were less likely to get diabetes; likewise Orthodox Christians in Greece. Religiousness was associated with better compliance in dialysis patients in Saudi Arabia; in Northern India, Hindu identification predicted better stress coping. Both Buddhist and Muslim women in Thailand managed their diabetes better if they were religious. Even in secular Denmark, religion protected health.Mary Read-Wahidi       and       Jason DeCaro,        anthropologists at the University of Alabama, explored the stresses of immigration in Scott County, Miss., publishing their work in May in the Medical Anthropology Quarterly. Between April and August 2013, the researchers systematically interviewed 60 Mexican immigrants sharing a devotion to the Virgin of Guadalupe in the county, in the central part of the state. As earlier researchers had shown with African-American women facing racism and so many others around the world dealing with illness, religious observances moderate the stresses of life in a new country.Anthropologists would call the Virgin of Guadalupe a master symbol\u2014one that has many meanings and functions in people\u2019s lives. Her following is particularly strong in Mexico, where, according to legend, she appeared in 1531 to a poor peasant named Juan Diego and\u2014in winter\u2014filled his cloak with flowers. Soon a local bishop and eventually the Catholic Church were persuaded by Juan\u2019s account. The immigrants of Scott County identified with the humble Juan Diego and melded their religious feeling with strands of nationalism: He was indigenous, yet under Spanish colonialism he had become a stranger in a strange land.Some of the immigrants in the study were undocumented, living in fear of discovery. Many were doing hard, dangerous work, and most didn\u2019t have health insurance; Dr. DeCaro calls them \u201ca deeply disempowered community.\u201d The researchers tested them on the Immigration Stressor Scale, with questions like: How often do you feel lonely or isolated? How often do you worry about meeting the basic needs of your family? The subjects also rated their own well-being, physically and socially.Additionally, the researchers developed a scale for \u201ccultural consonance\u201d with Guadalupan devotion\u2014in other words, how many Guadalupan beliefs and practices the subjects adopted, such as keeping a statue of the Virgin in their homes or cars, pursuing the tradition of bringing her flowers (recalling her favor to Juan) or rating her annual festival as very important. Paths to high-consonance scores could vary, from praying to the Virgin regularly to attending communal events in her honor. Those with high cultural consonance were resilient to the effects of stress on well-being: Greater immigration-related stress wasn\u2019t tied to worse physical or psychosocial outcomes.

Every spring, we switched our indoor pool sessions for much choppier circuits in the Atlantic parallel to the long, straight shore of Narragansett beach. And when we waded out afterward, peeling back our wetsuits and inspecting the occasional jellyfish sting, someone always produced a watermelon.Coming from the U.K., I found watermelons slightly alien: giant balloons masquerading as fruit, too large to take seriously. The mystery to me was how anyone ever knew that this giant green lump was ripe. One person told me that you tap on it and listen, but someone else quickly jumped in to label this as an urban myth. Who was right?The tapping test depends on the fact that no solid object is perfectly rigid. They all have some elasticity (with limits, as anyone who has ever dropped a glass knows), and that means if you tap them, they will deform ever so slightly. But they rapidly spring back, overshoot and become a new deformed shape\u2014and so you\u2019ve started an oscillation.For instance, if you tap a coffee mug with a spoon, the tube of the mug (looking down from the top) becomes slightly football-shaped, then springs back and overshoots to become football-shaped the other way, and then back again. The vibration is far too small to see, but the solid surfaces of the mug push on the air, creating soundwaves that you can hear.Here\u2019s the useful bit: The speed of the vibration, how quickly it dies away and the shape of the deformation all depend on the size and shape of the mug and what it\u2019s made from. Fill the mug with water, and the pitch of the note drops because there is now extra mass inside that has to be shunted about, slowing the oscillation down. There\u2019s a huge amount of information about the structure of a solid object hidden in its acoustic signature, and the ripeness of a watermelon is closely related to its structure.The first test for watermelon quality is whether it has an unwanted air gap inside it. When you tap on a nice, clean shape like a mug, what you hear is close to a pure note\u2014the structure is symmetrical, and it rings like a bell. The same is true for watermelons. If you get a note with an identifiable pitch, the fruit is probably solid all the way through. A dull thud indicates that it\u2019s asymmetrical on the inside, and best avoided.The next question is ripeness. As watermelons ripen, their flesh becomes more dense but less elastic, and the combination means that a riper watermelon will ring with a lower note. This sounds useful, but there\u2019s a complication. If you line up a few coffee mugs of different sizes and tap them, you\u2019ll hear that the bigger mugs ring with lower notes (they vibrate more slowly) because of their size. So it is with the watermelon: What you hear also depends on how big the fruit is. There is no perfect note, but there is a perfect note for a fixed size of fruit. You need experience with lots of ripe watermelons to make the correct diagnosis, so this isn\u2019t a quick fix.Watermelons aren\u2019t the only objects that ring like this. Although we can\u2019t hear it, our entire planet will vibrate after a large earthquake (greater than magnitude 8.3), giving away clues about what\u2019s in its core. A ripe watermelon will take about 9 milliseconds to go through one cycle of oscillation. The equivalent vibration mode for Earth takes 54 minutes, but the principle is exactly the same.So listening to a watermelon really is useful, after a bit of practice. But it also opens the door to the richness of the acoustic world, where even a brief tap causes every object to sing its structure for all to hear.", "news_time": "2017-06-30 09:21:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-science-of-a-ripe-watermelon-1498828907", "news_title": "The Science of a Ripe Watermelon", "keywords": "helen czerski, physics,ripe watermelon, science, sound, watermelons"}, {"content": "Brian Skerry has been intrigued by the ocean ever since he took a course in scuba diving as a teenager.

On a one-year basis, the economy rose at its fastest pace in nearly three years, or before the oil-price shock, setting the stage for a possible Bank of Canada rate increase next month.Canada\u2019s gross domestic product, or the broadest measure of goods and services produced in an economy, rose 0.2% in April from the previous month, to 1.72 trillion Canadian dollars ($1.32 trillion), Statistics Canada said Friday. This represented a slowdown from the 0.5% increase recorded in March, but the April result was in line with market expectations, according to economists at Royal Bank of Canada.On a year-over-year basis, GDP rose 3.3% in April, or the biggest such gain since June, 2014.The services sector, which accounts for roughly two-thirds of output, did the heavy lifting in April, led by wholesale and retail trade. A strong gain in the commodity sector was offset by a decline in manufacturing.This piece of data emerges a month after Canada recorded the fastest pace of growth in the first quarter among Group of Seven countries, with 3.7% annualized expansion in the January-to-March period.The GDP results in April emerged just before the Bank of Canada issues its next interest-rate decision July 12, and against a backdrop of a significant sea-change in central bank messaging regarding the economic outlook. It has led investors to price in a roughly 70% chance the central bank raises its benchmark policy rate for the first time since 2010.The April GDP report signals \u201cthe economy carried considerable momentum into the second quarter,\u201d said       David Madani,        Toronto-based economist at Capital Economics. \u201cNeedless to say, this will reinforce market speculation that the Bank of Canada will raise interest rates soon.\u201dCommentary from senior central bank officials, led by Gov.       Stephen Poloz,        has highlighted how the two rate cuts delivered in 2015 have done their job in stoking growth, and positioning the economy on firmer ground amid the prospect of lower commodity prices.In an interview, this week that stoked rate-rise expectations for next month, Mr. Poloz said growth in Canada would decelerate following a strong first quarter, but not in a dramatic fashion. Growth would remain above potential, he added, and \u201cthat means that we\u2019re absorbing excess capacity that was built up in the wake of the crisis and then built up again in the wake of the oil shock two years ago.\u201d This would have to be taken into account when officials deliberate in July, he added.The change in the Bank of Canada\u2019s tone is in concert with similar signals from other major developed-world central banks, and suggests the days of unprecedented monetary stimulus are coming to close. This has led to a selloff this week in global government bonds, and advances in the Canadian dollar and U.K. pound.April\u2019s GDP report indicated 14 of the 20 sectors grew on a month-over-month basis, reinforcing the central bank\u2019s belief that the pickup in economic activity is broadening on an industrial and regional basis. Growth in the province of Quebec, for example, has been accelerating, and is on track for its best one-year performance in a decade.The wholesale and retail trade sectors both advanced 0.5% from the previous month, while mining grew 2.7% after declines in the previous two months. The energy sector rose 0.8%. The factory sector, however, fell 0.9%, on weakness in food processing and machinery production.Write to Paul Vieira at paul.vieira@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-30 09:11:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/canada-gdp-in-april-climbs-0-2-1498828298", "news_title": "Canada GDP in April Climbs 0.2%   ", "keywords": "bank of canada,canada,economic output,royal bank of canada,Bank of Canada,Statistics Canada,economic performance,indicators,economic growth,economic news"}, {"content": "Centene Corp.        CNC 0.25%       said Friday it would offer Affordable Care Act marketplace plans in 40 Missouri counties next year, including those in the western part of the state that had appeared poised to lack any exchange offerings.The announcement highlights the fluid situation in the marketplaces, as a series of insurers around the country have announced pullbacks that risk leaving bare ACA counties, but others have been willing to come in to those regions. Centene had previously announced that it would expand its exchange offerings, entering three new states including Missouri.Missouri was left at risk of having 25 counties without ACA insurers after Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas City said in May it would exit the exchanges, saying the business was unsustainable. In both Tennessee and Washington state, insurers have similarly agreed to come into counties that appeared likely to lack exchange coverage.Still, according to Kaiser Family Foundation estimates, around 36 counties in Ohio, Indiana and Nevada appear poised to be without an exchange insurer in 2018. The 14 Nevada counties joined the list this week when             Anthem Inc.       said it would pull back in the state and a smaller insurer said it would leave the exchanges altogether. Anthem previously pulled out of exchanges in Ohio, Wisconsin and Indiana.In addition to Missouri, Centene, a largely Medicaid-focused insurer, said earlier this month that it is entering the exchanges in Kansas and Nevada, as well as expanding in Ohio, among other states. The company said then it would like to help fill bare counties where possible but that its footprints weren\u2019t yet clear.Centene, unlike many competitors, has generally found profits in the marketplace business, and Chief Executive       Michael F. Neidorff       has said the company is willing to keep betting on it despite the uncertainty surrounding the future of the exchanges. Senate Republicans are attempting to pass a health overhaul but are straining to bring together all of their own members amid differences over the bill. House Republicans previously passed their own health bill.In a statement, Mr. Neidorff said Centene is based in Missouri and provides Medicaid coverage there. \u201cWe strive to be a responsible partner with the state and are committed to working closely with regulators and policy makers to collaborate on actions that stabilize the market and offer affordable coverage options,\u201d he said.In pulling back, many insurers have cited the uncertainty around the future of the marketplaces. They have particularly emphasized concerns about federal payments that help reduce costs for low-income enrollees, which the Trump administration has threatened to halt. Some companies have also said they are worried about enforcement of the ACA\u2019s mandate for most people to have health insurance, which would effectively be repealed in both the Senate and House bills.Write to Anna Wilde Mathews at anna.mathews@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-30 09:09:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/centene-to-offer-aca-exchange-plans-in-40-missouri-counties-in-2018-1498828178", "news_title": "Centene to Offer ACA Exchange Plans in 40 Missouri Counties in 2018", "keywords": " aca, affordable care act,centene, health exchanges, health marketplace,missouri health care, obamacare,Centene,CNC,Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas City,plans,strategy,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,society,community,welfare,social services,insurance,non-life insurance,health,medical insurance,health care,life sciences,financial services,health maintenance organizations,private health insurance"}, {"content": "The calm has been broken. The first half of 2017 has ended with big moves in global bond yields and exchange rates, sparked by a belated realization that central banks are increasingly edging toward reining in extraordinary policy measures. The stage is set for a scrappier second half.Comments this week from central bankers, most notably European Central Bank President       Mario Draghi,        have challenged the conditions that have lifted bonds and stocks together this year, and kept volatility low. The assumption that inflation was too soft for central banks to tighten policy is being questioned.Falling unemployment and closing output gaps mean emergency policy looks inappropriate: There is no emergency. Progress in the recovery means not changing policy settings delivers ever more stimulus. That raises fears about bubbles in stock and bond valuations. The withdrawal will likely be gradual, but the direction of travel is clear.Bonds got a rude awakening, especially in Europe, but with major reverberations in the U.S. The 10-year German yield has risen to 0.44% from 0.25% on Monday, dragging up the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield to 2.27% from 2.13%. Currencies swung too: the euro has risen to $1.14, its highest for over a year. Stocks got caught up in the turmoil too.What comes next? The first key indicator for investors is inflation. Friday, eurozone headline inflation came in at 1.3% for June, down from 1.4% in May. That is still far from the ECB\u2019s target of \u201cbelow, but close to\u201d 2%. But central bankers clearly want to engender confidence in reflation. And they may be more willing to look through swings in headline measures driven by erratic moves in oil and commodities prices\u2014as long as they think they are driven by supply, not demand.The second is investment. A pickup in investment spending would reassure central banks that growth isn\u2019t overly dependent on consumption. Bank of England Gov.       Mark Carney       noted in May that this could also lift the underlying level of interest rates, which would also require a response from central banks.The third is exchange rates. Central banks on the move are likely to see their currencies appreciate. That in turn could tighten financial conditions and weigh on inflation, potentially delaying actual policy moves.For markets, tension looms. If central bankers are making a mistake, and growth prospects dim, then bonds should do well while riskier assets struggle.If central bankers are right, and growth is solid while inflation is being held back by temporary factors, then bond buyers should lose out. Stocks in theory should do better, but to the extent valuations have been inflated by low interest rates, then there is a headwind.After a long stretch where both bonds and stocks have done well, a new landscape is forming.Write to Richard Barley at richard.barley@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-30 08:26:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/time-to-choose-sides-in-global-markets-1498825265", "news_title": "Time to Choose Sides in Global Markets   ", "keywords": "bond yields,euro,heard on the street,monetary policy,economic performance,indicators,inflation,prices,euro zone,currency,economic news,debt,bond markets,commodity,financial market news"}, {"content": "Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.

ETFC -1.00%       is playing off investors\u2019 tempers\u2014and envy\u2014in its latest advertising effort.The New York company, long known for its stock-savvy talking babies, launched an advertising campaign in mid-June aimed at bringing E*Trade to the fore of investors\u2019 minds, the latest piece of its plan to rejuvenate its core brokerage business.The ads, which are running on television, online and in print publications, attempt to channel the angst of watching celebrities and others fall into easy money, says Lea Stendahl, E*Trade\u2019s senior vice president and head of marketing.In one of its television spots, a yacht carelessly zips along the ocean, knocking down two unsuspecting paddle boarders as its occupants party hard. \u201cThe dumbest guy in high school just got a boat,\u201d the ad says. \u201cDon\u2019t get mad...\u201d\u201cWe made a conscious effort to get back to that tone and irreverence\u201d that made E*Trade a household name in the 1990s and 2000s, Ms. Stendahl said.Analysts say the latest flurry of ads will likely resonate with viewers who remember E*Trade in its earlier years, which could help bring back former customers. \u201cThis does bring back more of the sentiment from the original E*Trade,\u201d said       Richard Repetto,        an analyst at Sandler O\u2019Neill + Partners LP.While many of its competitors had focused their advertising on cost and services, E*Trade, over the years, had opted for humor. In 2000, just four years after going public, E*Trade\u2019s Super Bowl spot featured a monkey dancing to La Cucaracha. \u201cWell, we just wasted 2 million bucks,\u201d the ad said. \u201cWhat are you doing with your money?\u201dIt wasn\u2019t until 2008, however, when E*Trade cemented itself in the minds of millions of people with its first talking-baby ad during the Super Bowl that year. Over the next six years, E*Trade relied on its talking babies to make investing, through E*Trade\u2019s platform, easy and approachable.That was until Paul T. Idzik took over as chief executive in 2013. Mr. Idzik, a former Barclays PLC executive, ended the campaign and said the company\u2019s marketing efforts needed a \u201cmuch sharper focus\u201d and \u201cless emphasis on blanket advertising.\u201d Mr. Idzik didn\u2019t return a phone call seeking comment.A year later, E*Trade opted for an older face in actor Kevin Spacey, who acted as a talent scout trying to find \u201cType-E\u201d investors, or those who prefer to direct their own investments.E*Trade expects its latest ad campaign to shift over time to tackle specific topics, such as its focus on attracting active traders and new tools for derivatives trades.Write to Michael Wursthorn at Michael.Wursthorn@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-30 08:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/no-talking-baby-but-e-trade-ad-blitz-takes-familiar-tone-1498824001", "news_title": "No Talking Baby, but E*Trade Ad Blitz Takes Familiar Tone", "keywords": "etrade ad campaign,E*Trade Financial,ETFC,marketing,markets,advertising,corporate,industrial news,financial investments,online brokers,after hours trading,public relations,business,consumer services,financial services,investing,securities"}, {"content": "E*Trade Financial Corp.\u2019s        ETFC -1.00%       board has delivered an ultimatum to its new chief executive: Clearly define the company\u2019s future by the end of next year or face a possible sale, executives at the discount brokerage say.In issuing its mandate, the board is asking       Karl Roessner,        E*Trade\u2019s chief since September, to reinvigorate the core brokerage business and achieve a revival that has largely eluded the six CEOs who preceded him after the company\u2019s near implosion during the financial crisis.\u201cWe have to get there...and make sure we can grow this [business] organically,\u201d Mr. Roessner, who is 49, a former deal attorney and had been company\u2019s general counsel since 2009, said in an interview. \u201cWe have to turn around that stagnation from the top of the house.\u201dMr. Roessner\u2019s plan is simple: return the company to its roots as an irreverent fintech firm. The 35-year-old brokerage is refreshing its trading technology, deepening its derivative-trading capabilities, and embarking on an advertising campaign to appeal to investors\u2019 aspirational desires.But E*Trade\u2019s pursuit of traders and commissions is going against the tide in an investing landscape that has been upended since the company\u2019s heyday in the 1990s and early 2000s. Its biggest rivals, including             Charles Schwab Corp.        SCHW -1.61%       and             TD Ameritrade Inc.,       have moved away from relying on commissions, which are at record lows, and instead pursued fee-based accounts. Smaller competitors such as Scottrade Financial Services Inc. have decided they couldn\u2019t go it alone and have sold themselves. And startups like Robinhood Corp. have captured younger investors with commission-free trading.Besides that, E*Trade is trying to court investors at a time when many have taken to simply matching the market\u2019s performance amid eight years of rising stock prices. Some $1.2 trillion has been withdrawn from actively managed U.S. stock funds since the start of 2007 through March, according to             Morningstar Inc.       Nearly the same amount, $1.1 trillion, has moved into passive U.S. stock funds that track broad indexes such as the S&P 500.Shares of E*Trade have rallied nearly 9% so far this year to $37.68, keeping its gains close to rival Schwab, which is also up around 9% this year. TD Ameritrade, meanwhile, is down about 2%. E*Trade is still trading well below its $241 share price in mid-2007 and its peak of $577 in 1999.\u201cE*Trade is smaller than some of its larger competitors, so they\u2019re going to have to keep looking for ways to be disruptive,\u201d said Devin Ryan, a brokerage analyst with JMP Securities.E*Trade is targeting investors who trade 30 times a month or more on their own and like derivative plays, such as options, believing that its rivals haven\u2019t been catering to them much. Last year, it bought Aperture New Holdings Inc., the parent of online broker OptionsHouse LLC, for $725 million, to boost its derivative offerings and overhaul its trading platform.Attracting those types of investors would bring Mr. Roessner closer to meeting the board\u2019s growth expectations. By the end of next year, Mr. Roessner says he has to boost the firm\u2019s net new brokerage asset and account growth rates by 2% to 3% each, while increasing the firm\u2019s mix of derivatives trades and amount of managed products, which includes services offered through its automated robo adviser.If E*Trade falls short of those goals, the board will then consider strategic alternatives, including a possible sale, Mr. Roessner said.\u201cOur decision to present specific growth goals, to be achieved within an aggressive timeline, was questioned by some,\u201d said       Rodger Lawson,        executive chairman of E*Trade\u2019s board. \u201cBut as a board we had great faith in the inherent but underused power of the E*Trade brand.\u201dE*Trade has already approached some of those benchmarks, pushing its net new brokerage asset growth rate to 6.1% in the first quarter of this year from 3.8% last year, while net new brokerage account growth has more than doubled to 6.7%.Analysts say E*Trade is moving in the right direction, but the brokerage industry\u2019s challenges can make further gains harder to obtain.Mr. Roessner acknowledges as much. \u201cThese are early successes,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to show consistently that we can grow this.\u201dThis turnaround effort begins the latest chapter for the brokerage pioneer that upended Wall Street\u2019s traditional investing model with the first online trade in 1983.

E*Trade turned to banking to steady its revenue and amassed billions of dollars in toxic subprime mortgages on its balance sheet\u2014a move that proved near fatal as the financial system started to blow up in 2007.E*Trade suffered a $1.44 billion loss in 2007\u2014its worst year in its history after reporting a $628.9 million profit in 2006.In the years since, E*Trade attempted to stabilize itself, twice leaning on its largest investor at the time, hedge-fund giant Citadel LLC, for help.Over that time, the company lost its competitive edge, analysts and executives at E*Trade say, as its technology grew stale and rivals, both new and old, kept a step ahead.\u201cThey were really in a difficult spot,\u201d JMP\u2019s Mr. Ryan said. \u201cThat created a situation where the firm was inward focused so they could live to fight another day.\u201dIf the turnaround falls short of the board\u2019s expectations, analysts say, E*Trade\u2019s prospects as an M&A target are promising, with more than $37 billion in deposits and $336 billion in assets spread across 3.5 million accounts. \u201cIt\u2019s a firm that would be attractive for a lot of reasons,\u201d Mr. Ryan said. \u201cThe most obvious attraction is adding scale.\u201dWrite to Michael Wursthorn at Michael.Wursthorn@wsj.comAppeared in the July 1, 2017, print edition as 'E*Trade Returns to Roots In a Last Bid to Survive.'", "news_time": "2017-06-30 08:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/e-trade-in-bid-to-survive-returns-to-its-roots-1498824000", "news_title": "E*Trade, in Bid to Survive, Returns to Its Roots", "keywords": "etrade ads,etrade ceo,etrade turnaround,E*Trade Financial,ETFC,Charles Schwab,SCHW,Robinhood,Karl Roessner,marketing,markets,advertising,corporate,industrial news,financial investments,online brokers,after hours trading,financial services,investing,securities"}, {"content": "Good morning.

AMC\u2019s logic is that some customers will do anything they can to avoid ads and $4.99 a month is cheaper than downloading individual shows.

Tax payments climbed at the fastest quarterly pace since 1998, partly due to the timing of tax self-assessments filed by a growing number of self-employed taxpayers.The pressure on Britons\u2019 household budgets meant that they further depleted their rainy-day funds to finance consumption. U.K. household saved only 1.7% on their income in the first quarter of the year, the lowest on record, data showed.These developments seem to have hit economic sentiment, a survey showed earlier on Friday.Data compiled by market researcher GfK U.K. Ltd for the European Union\u2019s executive showed British consumers\u2019 mood soured significantly in June, as they became increasingly concerned about the country\u2019s economy as well as their own financial situation, and grew uneasy about splashing out on big-ticket items. Sentiment was last more pessimistic in the immediate aftermath of the Brexit referendum.As squeezed consumers pared back spending, the largely domestic-driven U.K. economy slowed sharply in the first quarter of the year, the ONS also confirmed on Friday.The quarterly growth in the first three months of the year stood at 0.2%, the final reading showed, significantly below the 0.7% quarterly rate seen in the last quarter of 2016. On an annualized basis, growth stood at 0.9%.\u201cThe detail of today\u2019s data might call into question the sustainability of even this rate of growth,\u201d said       Scott Bowman,        U.K. economist at Capital Economics, a London-based consultancy.VIEW InteractiveHowever, the fall in saving ratio reflected mainly the higher tax payments, driven partly by temporary factors, Mr. Bowman said, and the latest monthly trade data and surveys of export orders suggest that net trade will also start contributing positively to growth in coming quarters.Spurred by the pound\u2019s steep depreciation after last year\u2019s June 23 Brexit referendum, annual inflation in the U.K. accelerated in May to 2.9%, the fastest rate since June 2013, and significantly exceeding the pace of growth in wages.Shrinking real wages and disposable income and severely depleted savings means British households have resorted to debt to fuel their consumption, with unsecured borrowing growing at an annual rate of over 10% for several months now.Concerned about the buildup of unsecured loans, the Bank of England this week ordered banks to begin rebuilding buffers of capital, which it had allowed them to run down to keep credit flowing after the Brexit vote.The instruction to start rebuilding the capital buffers to pre-referendum levels came amid an intensifying debate among BOE policy makers over whether to begin gradually increasing borrowing costs.Bank of England Gov.       Mark Carney       said this week that an interest-rate increase may be necessary in the U.K. if higher business investment and exports begin to offset slowing consumer spending.Data Friday showed the U.K.\u2019s current-account deficit widened in the first quarter, however, though business investment rose.Write to Wiktor Szary at Wiktor.Szary@wsj.com and Jason Douglas at jason.douglas@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-30 07:33:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-k-households-suffer-longest-squeeze-in-40-years-1498813580", "news_title": "U.K. Households Suffer Longest Squeeze in 40 Years", "keywords": " brexit, jeremy corbyn,theresa may, uk disposable income,uk living standards, uk wages, uk wage squeeze,European Union,Office for National Statistics,labor,personnel,corporate,industrial news,workers pay,economic performance,indicators,inflation,prices,personal income,average earnings,monetary policy,economic news,political,general news,international relations,politics,domestic politics,statistics,banking,central banking,credit,financial services"}, {"content": "The murmur of discontent about subscription lines of financing is slowly getting louder, but some say it\u2019s not quite loud enough.The use of these credit lines, which were originally designed as short-term financing that firms could draw down instead of having to call capital from their investors, has been increasing steadily, as have questions about how and why they are really being used.Opinions are all over the map. In the past year, many influential voices\u2014such as       Howard Marks,        co-chairman of             Oaktree Capital                   Management\u2014have warned about their dangers and potential for abuse, but others in the industry, including some limited partners, think they are useful and basically harmless. Regulators have been all but silent on the matter, at least in public.Now the Institutional Limited Partners Association, one of the biggest trade groups of private-equity investors, has weighed in, offering a thorough list of suggestions for what LPs can do to make sure they don\u2019t get snowed by a firm abusing its subscription lines.The recommendations may soon become part of every LP\u2019s thinking about the issue. ILPA suggests demanding more transparency from general partners, including quarterly reports on the balance of subscription lines, their costs to the fund, how long they have been drawn and how they have affected the reported performance of the fund.Given the range of opinions even among LPs on credit lines, it isn\u2019t surprising that ILPA took a balanced stance on the issue, putting the focus on disclosure and transparency. The group\u2019s basic premise is based on the idea that the use of lines of credit \u201cshould accrue to the benefit of the LP,\u201d and the group gives nine specific recommendations, covering two pages, for how to achieve that aim.Faced with this list of questions to ask and boxes to check\u2014which is preceded by another page and a half about the risks of lines of credit\u2014investors may wonder what they get out of the use of subscription lines. Some say very little. They content that from an investor point of view subscription lines simply replace an administrative headache with a due-diligence headache.The lines of credit can be useful for cash management. If a firm has to put money down to close a deal on a short deadline, the subscription line can make that possible without having to wait the week or so that a capital-call can take. They also can give firms and LPs the convenience of planning for regular capital calls\u2014quarterly or biannual, say\u2014rather than having to be ready for a call whenever a firm needs to close a deal.But against that benefit, subscription lines have their share of drawbacks, the simplest being cost. There are bank fees and interest payments associated with any line of credit, even with interest rates as low as they have been, and these are borne by the fund investors.Second, they distort the calculation of internal rate of return, making it more difficult to judge a GP\u2019s performance, especially early in a fund\u2019s life. When a fund doesn\u2019t use a subscription line, its IRR will usually be low or negative in its first few years, because LPs are charged management fees that are drawn down in advance for deals that can take years to pay off. But with a subscription line, that IRR pattern is reversed, since the deals can be done without drawing investor capital.The longer a subscription line is used\u2014and nowadays some managers use subscription lines for much longer than the once-standard 90 days or so, up to years in some cases\u2014the more it inflates the IRR.However, while they fluff up IRRs, subscription lines don\u2019t actually change what a fund ultimately pays out. So in effect, investors pay interest so that the sponsor can have an illusory performance bump\u2014though one that may be helpful in raising money.There also are tax, liquidity and legal-liability questions about subscription lines, which ILPA thoroughly lays out. And though the group doesn\u2019t bring them up, there are potential systemic risks from subscription lines, as Oaktree\u2019s Mr. Marks pointed out in an April investor note. For instance, in case of a financial crisis, subscription lines could spread risk throughout the financial system if banks demand repayment all at once and LPs can\u2019t meet the demand.From an LP\u2019s perspective, subscription lines increase expenses, tax liability and due-diligence work, make it more challenging to assess a manager\u2019s performance, and add unquantifiable\u2014but potentially significant\u2014risks in case of a financial shock. In exchange, they get a minor administrative convenience\u2014and GPs get a short-term and purely cosmetic performance bump.That many LPs seem to accept that trade off suggests the balance of power between investors and firms when negotiating fund terms and conditions is deeply skewed in the industry\u2019s favor.Write to Chris Cumming at chris.cumming@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-30 07:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/cummings-take-should-investors-be-angrier-about-subscription-lines-1498822204", "news_title": "Cumming\u2019s Take: Should Investors Be Angrier About Subscription Lines?", "keywords": "Oaktree Capital Group LLC Un,OAK,analyses,commentaries,opinions,financial investments,portfolio,fund,asset management,financial services,investing,securities"}, {"content": "BERLIN\u2014Germany\u2019s parliament legalized same-sex marriage in a snap ballot Friday despite Chancellor       Angela Merkel\u2019s       no vote.The approval followed a debate in the Bundestag lower house of parliament after Ms. Merkel in a surprise move Monday said she would want lawmakers to decide on the issue as it fits their conscience, freeing her center-right party from a line whip because the bloc\u2019s platform defines marriage as the union of a man and a woman.In a suddenly scheduled vote Friday at the house\u2019s final meeting before the summer break, 393 lawmakers voted for the same-sex marriage while 226 voted against it and four abstained.Ms. Merkel said after the ballot that she voted against same-sex marriage because although she wants same-sex couples to have the right to adopt, she believes \u201cthe marriage in Germany\u2019s constitution is the marriage between man and woman.\u201dBut she also said opposite views must be respected.One senior lawmaker from her junior coalition partner, the Social Democrats, sharply attacked the chancellor\u2019s maneuver this week as \u201cdisgraceful\u201d and said she had failed to support marriage for gay people since she came to power 11 years ago.\u201cThanks for nothing,\u201d shouted       Johannes Kahrs,        an openly gay lawmaker with the Social Democrats, during the lower house debate.The sudden vote was possible because although no bill to legalize same-sex marriage had been voted on previously, several had already been submitted to parliament.VIEW InteractiveMs. Merkel\u2019s challenger for the chancellorship in the September election, Social Democrat       Martin Schulz,        then demanded a vote by the end of this week, when the lower house of parliament adjourns for the summer.Some in the chancellor\u2019s conservatives sharply attacked the Social Democrats\u2019 move because it was contrary to the coalition treaty between both blocks, with the conservatives parliamentary floor leader       Volker Kauder       accusing them of a \u201cbreach of trust.\u201dAround a dozen EU countries, including France, Spain and Belgium, allow same-sex marriage.Ms. Merkel was under pressure to move on the issue because all her potential coalition partners after the September election\u2014the Social Democrats, the environmentalist Greens, and the business-friendly Free Democrats\u2014had voiced their support for same-sex marriage, which polls show a broad majority of Germans approve.\u2014Anton Troianovski contributed to this articleWrite to Andrea Thomas at andrea.thomas@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-30 07:20:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/germany-legalizes-same-sex-marriage-1498812214", "news_title": "Germany Legalizes Same-Sex Marriage", "keywords": "Angela Merkel,political,general news,society,community,same-sex marriage,civil union,human rights,civil liberties,lgbt rights,politics,international relations,domestic politics,social issues,government bodies,legislative branch,lower house,marriage,divorce"}, {"content": "Sign up: With one click, get this newsletter delivered to your inbox.One of the architects of industrial globalization is going local.

A new state law that allows delivery drivers to use the vehicles on some public roads led UPS to retrofit the vehicles and attach trailers or flatbeds, an attempt to use the most efficient, flexible transport to keep goods moving. The local union says the real savings are on labor since part-time drivers will operate the carts, and the union says the vehicles aren\u2019t safe for roads despite the face-lift UPS will provide. The big driver is e-commerce: with online sales fueling more residential deliveries, package carriers are anxious to cut the high costs of bringing conventional vans to neighborhoods.Grocery delivery companies are moving fast, and it may be because a big competitor is coming up behind them.

Ahold Delhaize\u2019s Peapod is expanding its push into New York City after spending $94 million to put a warehouse in Jersey City, N.J., one of several expansions the operators are undertaking to build up what remains a niche business. Delivery services account for less than 2% of the $715 billion in U.S. food-retail sales, and face big hurdles in gaining customers. Razor-thin margins and tough logistics demands remain big issues, and experts say the planned Amazon-Whole Foods partnership will provide a new challenge, adding a competitor with big scale and infrastructure already in place.Drivers going over the Brent Spence Bridge between Ohio and Kentucky will have plenty of time this summer to contemplate the decaying state of America infrastructure.

Still, following Prime Minister       Narendra Modi\u2019s       botched demonetization program last year, there is a risk that the rollout could go wrong. The country\u2019s growth and consumption, already hit by the cash cleanup, could be derailed further if companies struggle to adjust.Like most things in India, the tax too is complicated. Rather than creating a single sales tax rate, as in most countries, charges will vary on different categories of goods, ranging from 5% on mass consumption goods to 28% on consumer durables. Items such as tobacco and luxury cars could face an even higher rate.The variations mean companies might have incentive to produce lower-quality goods or find some other way to circumvent higher rates on their goods. Moreover, a confusing \u201canti-profiteering\u201d clause means businesses will have to pass on any upside they gain from lower taxes on their goods by cutting prices. Such clauses haven\u2019t worked well in other countries: In Malaysia, for example, the policy actually contributed to an inflation rise.The broader upshot is that consumer demand in India faces significant change. More than a quarter of Indian consumer goods, including hair oil, incense sticks, soda and the widely used clarified butter known as ghee, are set to get more expensive while a fifth will get cheaper, according to             Goldman Sachs.For consumer companies with deep supply chains across India, this alters the calculus of doing business. India is a notoriously price-sensitive market. Pharmaceuticals giant             GlaxoSmithKline,       which has a big business in India, faces lower sales growth in fiscal 2018 because of the tax, analysts reckon; its consumer health-care company will likely have to raise prices or endure thinner margins. Maruti Suzuki, maker of one of the most popular cars on Indian roads, could see prices fall by 2% to 3%, which could hit revenue if a rise in demand doesn\u2019t compensate.In India, it seems, even reforms supposed to simplify can prove a headache.Write to Anjani Trivedi at anjani.trivedi@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-30 06:14:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/indias-tax-reform-is-far-from-straightforward-1498817652", "news_title": "India\u2019s Tax Reform Is Far From Straightforward", "keywords": " india reform, india sales tax,india tax, india tax overhaul, india tax plan, india tax reform,government finance,government budget,taxation,direct taxation,economic news,sales tax,commodity,financial market news"}, {"content": "The eurozone\u2019s annual rate of inflation fell for the second straight month in June to its lowest level in 2017, in a setback for the European Central Bank as its stimulus programs enter a fourth year.The European Union\u2019s statistics agency said Friday that consumer prices in the currency area were 1.3% higher than a year earlier, compared with 1.4% in May. That means the annual rate of inflation is further away from the ECB\u2019s target of just below 2%, a goal it has spent years trying to reach using a variety of stimulus measures. The ECB\u2019s economists don\u2019t expect inflation to meet the target at any point through 2019.June\u2019s inflation reading was the lowest in 2017, largely reflecting a slowing of energy prices. It serves as a reminder of how difficult it has been for the central bank to boost consumer prices since it first resorted to extraordinary measures by taking one of its key interest rates into negative territory in June 2014.Back then, the headline rate of inflation was just 0.5%, so progress has been made. However, the measure of core, or underlying, inflation that excludes items such as energy and food\u2014whose prices are largely beyond the ECB\u2019s influence\u2014tells a less heartening story. In June 2014, this measure stood at 0.8%\u2014and wasn\u2019t much higher in June 2017 at 1.1%, up from 0.9% the month before.Nonetheless, with economic growth accelerating, ECB President       Mario Draghi       hinted Tuesday that policy makers might start winding down their bond purchases.His comments roiled financial markets, with the euro appreciating against the U.S. dollar and government bond prices falling as investors anticipate a reduction in the monthly rate of purchases under the quantitative-easing program.\u201cAfter the market interpreted Mr. Draghi\u2019s comments as an indication that the current monetary policy could be normalized sooner rather than later, today\u2019s reality check may serve as reminder to investors that the European Central Bank is still not in a hurry,\u201d said       Julien Lafargue,        European equities strategist at J.P. Morgan Private Bank.\u201cYet, the macroeconomic momentum remains supportive and core inflation is gradually recovering. As such the direction of travel for rates, however gradual it may be, is likely higher.\u201dIn recent months, the ECB has homed in on wages as a key factor in determining when it will be comfortable with easing back on its stimulus measures.While acknowledging that inflation had been lower than expected given the steady fall in the rate of unemployment, Mr. Draghi said that most of the factors holding back wages were temporary and that \u201cwe can be more assured about the return of inflation to our objective than we were a few years ago.\u201dFalling unemployment should help raise wages and in turn, inflation, but ECB policy makers have recently said slack in the jobs market goes beyond measured unemployment, and includes people who want to work more hours, and move from temporary to full-time contracts.Ultimately, however, the ECB believes that continued strong economic growth will close the gap between what the eurozone economy can produce and what it is producing, with the result that prices will start to rise more rapidly.\u201cThe relationship between growth and inflation may have been loosened somewhat by a number of structural changes\u2014technological advances, globalization and the impact of structural reforms\u2014but it has not been eliminated,\u201d said             BNP Paribas                   economist       Luigi Speranza.\u201cIf, as the ECB expects, the output gap continues to close over time, inflation should converge gradually toward 2%\u2014in other words, the current period of subdued inflation is temporary,\u201d he added.Write to Paul Hannon at paul.hannon@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-30 05:54:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/eurozone-inflation-falls-again-in-setback-for-ecb-1498815490", "news_title": "Eurozone Inflation Falls Again in Setback for ECB ", "keywords": " cost of living, ecb president mario draghi, europe economy,eurozone inflation, inflation rate,European Central Bank,economic performance,indicators,inflation,prices,monetary policy,central bank intervention,euro zone,currency,economic news,economic zones,banking,central banking,credit,financial services"}, {"content": "Deadly sarin gas was used in an attack in Syria in April, the international chemical weapons watchdog confirmed Friday, after the U.S. accused the Syrian government of preparing for a similar attack.The U.S., U.K. and other Western powers have previously accused President       Bashar al-Assad\u2019s       government of using the nerve agent during the April 4 attack on the town of Khan Sheikhoun in Idlib province, in which at least 85 people were killed, according to rescue workers and an opposition monitoring group.The confirmation by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons doesn\u2019t assign blame for the gas attack. A joint United Nations-OPCW investigation will use the findings announced Friday to evaluate who was responsible.Mr. Assad       said in April that his government had given up its chemical weapons arsenal a few years before. Russia, his main ally along with Iran, called the allegations of Syrian regime involvement in the April attack \u201cbaseless.\u201dIn response to the gas attack, the deadliest use of chemical weapons in Syria since 2013, President       Donald Trump       ordered a Tomahawk cruise missile attack on the Syrian air base that Washington said had played a role in the assault.In releasing its findings on Friday, the OPCW said its investigators weren\u2019t able to reach Khan Sheikhoun. However, the organization said it attended autopsies, collected medical samples from the casualties and interviewed witnesses.On Monday, the Trump administration said they had evidence of possible preparations by the Syrian government to carry out another gas attack and warned Damascus against doing so, a threat that Russia immediately denounced as \u201cunacceptable.\u201d Two days later, U.S. Defense Secretary       Jim Mattis       said the U.S. warning had appeared, at least for now, to have deterred Mr. Assad\u2019s forces.U.S. defense officials said they were continuing to watch the Syrian military and are prepared to act to either stop an attack or punish the regime should they carry out another gas attack.Speaking on Thursday in Brussels, ahead of the release of the OPCW report, U.K. Defense Secretary       Michael Fallon       said there is little doubt the Syrian government was responsible for the April 4 attack.\u201cWe have our own evidence that it is highly likely the regime did it,\u201d Mr. Fallon said. \u201cClearly the gas was dropped from the air.

This month Texas Comptroller Glenn Hegar announced\u00a0the state tapped Lone Star Tangible Assets,\u00a0which stores and trades precious metals,\u00a0to build and operate a bullion depository in Austin.Mr. Hegar said the depository would serve as an alternative stash for gold and other precious metals in place of federally regulated banks or smaller, unregulated storage facilities.Gov. Greg Abbott, who signed a 2015 bill to create the depository, and others have called for the \u201crepatriation\u201d of Texas gold.Mr. Hegar said the state has bigger plans beyond claiming UT\u2019s gold.State officials say they also envision expanding the depository into a commodities exchange for natural resources such as oil and natural gas, potentially challenging the existing commodities marketplaces in Chicago and New York City.\u201cOnce the depository is up and running and people see how easy it is to make transactions there, I think it\u2019s just a natural progression of things that we\u2019ll be working with other commodities as well,\u201d\u00a0said Republican state Rep. Giovanni Capriglione, who wrote the 2015 bill.Construction on the Texas Bullion Depository is scheduled to start this September, a Lone Star spokesman said. The depository is slated to open in December 2018.The security at the facility\u2014which dubs itself \u201cThe Fort Knox of Texas\u201d\u2014will be up to par with \u201cmilitary installation,\u201d Lone Star Chairman Matthew Ferris said.Mr. Capriglione first proposed a depository run entirely by the state in 2013.That bill came with a hefty price tag for the state\u2014$27.6 million over five years\u2014and didn\u2019t pass. Mr.\u00a0Capriglione\u00a0tried again in 2015, this time proposing a public-private partnership in which a private entity would own and operate the facility under oversight from the state.Under the 2015 law, the Texas Bullion Depository would function as a state agency contracted with Lone Star to build and run the vault facility.Lone Star would get 90% of the revenue from fees, and the state would receive 10%, which would be used to offset administrative costs, a state spokeswoman said.Motivated by the 2008 financial crisis, Mr. Capriglione said he is calling for Texas\u2019 \u201cindependence and sovereignty\u201d from Wall Street banks and the Federal Reserve,\u00a0but isn\u2019t advocating a complete break.\u201cI don\u2019t think that we should blow away with the existing system, but there\u2019s nothing wrong with having a plan B,\u201d Mr. Capriglione said. \u201cThat\u2019s what our depository does.\u201dFor years, Texas Republicans have championed a currency system backed by gold and other precious metals. In its\u00a02016 platform, the Republican Party of Texas called for a return to \u201cprecious metal standard for the United States dollar\u201d and abolishing the Federal Reserve.A spokeswoman for the University of Texas said the school will \u201cseriously consider\u201d \u00a0moving the gold from its             HSBC                   vault to the new depository in Texas if the state meets two conditions.First, the depository would have to be a member of the Comex\u00a0commodities exchange, which requires member institutions to be within 150-mile radius of New York City for inspection.Mr. Ferris said Lone Star is in talks with a number of \u201cthird-party banks\u201d to provide liquidity for assets in the depository, which would exempt it from the geographical requirement.Second, cost of storing the gold in Texas would have to be less than what UT currently pays to HSBC Holdings PLC. The school pays $606,000 a year to store the gold in New York, the university said.HSBC declined to say how much it charges for storage, and wouldn\u2019t disclose whether UT is a client. A spokeswoman for the bank said it doesn\u2019t reveal its clients.Lone Star said storage fees for over $50 million is \u201cnegotiable\u201d and no more than 0.15% of the asset value a year.

Unemployment has declined, but remained at 9.3% in the first quarter of 2017.\u201cIf we want to get rid of this situation, this grim situation, that has such negative consequences on French society, we must have the courage to introduce those reforms,\u201d he said. \u201cExcessive public expenditures are not the answer to unemployment, it is one of the reasons for unemployment in France.

In the first quarter, gross domestic product grew at just a 1.4% annual rate, while investment in capital equipment, new plants and the like increased 10.4%. Absent that gain, GDP would have grown by just 0.2%.The jump in capital spending\u2014the largest in five years\u2014suggested companies were finally shaking off some off their caution. In truth, most of that spending was by energy companies ramping up drilling after oil prices recovered. With energy prices sliding, the rebound is looking short-lived.Spending on energy-related equipment and structures (such as oil wells) counted for about 40% of the gain in capital spending in the first quarter. Since energy firms buy plenty of other items, such as transportation equipment, their share of overall capital spending was probably even larger.There won\u2019t be a repeat performance in the second quarter. Much of the gain in energy-sector spending in the first quarter likely came from purchases that were deferred in response to the crash in oil prices. And the recovery in oil prices to an average of $52 a barrel in the first quarter soothed nerves.Oil prices have retreated since then, with a barrel lately fetching $44.93 in New York trading.             Morgan Stanley                   warned in a note this week that the likelihood of a \u201csharp dip in oil prices to a level that chokes US drilling\u201d is increasing. Even if that scenario doesn\u2019t unfold, spending will likely be lower: Overall, U.S. oil and exploration companies reported a sharp increase in exploration expenses in the first quarter, but FactSet data show industry analysts expect that strength to quickly fade.A survey from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas released Wednesday showed that energy firms were less optimistic in the second quarter than the first quarter, and that fewer firms were increasing their capital spending. Comments from respondents to the survey exhibited plenty of worry.Slower energy-sector spending may be why overall spending figures have lately been soft. Earlier this week, the Commerce Department reported that shipments and orders for nondefense capital goods, excluding aircraft\u2014proxies for current and future capital spending\u2014slipped in May from April.The news isn\u2019t all bad: Lower oil prices give consumers more money to spend elsewhere, and energy-intensive industries will also benefit. But as economists at Cornerstone Macro point out, with the U.S. now a major energy producer, those offsets aren\u2019t as powerful as they once were. Lacking a boost from stronger capital spending, the economy is probably destined to just muddle along.Write to Justin Lahart at justin.lahart@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-30 05:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/economy-is-losing-a-big-booster-1498815001", "news_title": "Economy Is Losing a Big Booster ", "keywords": "capital spending,energy companies ,energy prices,gdp,oil prices,plans,strategy,capital expenditure,corporate,industrial news,economic performance,indicators,economic growth,economic news,commodity markets,energy markets,commodity,financial market news,crude oil markets"}, {"content": "An unusual workforce labors beneath the surface of the world\u2019s farms.It can turn over 8,000 pounds of earth on an acre of land in two weeks. Its tunnels aerate the soil, and its castings nourish it.Not bad for invertebrates the size of a string bean.They are earthworms, the industrious wigglers Charles Darwin once called nature\u2019s plow. But farmers\u2019 plows have been killing the tiny tillers for decades, leaving cropland less fertile and increasing the need for chemical nutrients.A new study confirms the impact of conventional plowing and evaluates the effects of alternative tilling methods.\u201cConventionally plowed soils reduce earthworm populations drastically, and this means that we get few of the good things that earthworms do for us,\u201d said Maria J.I. Briones, an author of the study and a professor of soil zoology at Universidad de Vigo in Spain.Earthworm populations can bounce back if conventional plowing is replaced with less disruptive methods, but there are trade-offs.Conventional tillage, which disrupts soil to a depth of 8 to 16 inches, provides crops with optimal conditions for germination and inhibits weeds, pests and disease.Conservation methods\u2014such as no till or strip till that forgo plowing or limit it to shallow depths in targeted areas\u2014reduce fuel and labor costs and the need for chemical fertilizers, but crop yields may shrink and the need for herbicides may increase.\u201cWhen you use no till or reduced till, you put less energy and less work into the system,\u201d said David Jones, a biologist and earthworm expert at the Natural History Museum in London. \u201cIt\u2019s not surprising that yield might drop, but it benefits the soil and the long-term sustainability of agriculture. You have to look at what you want to achieve in the long term.\u201dEarthworms improve the structure and fertility of soil by working organic material into the dirt, providing channels that make it easier for water and oxygen to penetrate it and converting nutrients into forms plants can readily absorb. When the population of the worms is diminished, the quality of the soil suffers.To gauge the extent of the problem, Dr. Briones and Olaf Schmidt, a professor in the school of agriculture and food science at University College in Dublin, reviewed 215 field studies from 40 countries dating back to 1950.Their research, published in the scientific journal Global Change Biology, found declining populations in fields that were plowed every year. Disturbing the soil less increased abundance up to 137%.Conventional plowing kills earthworms through injury or by exposing them to predators, destroying their burrows and diminishing their food supply.\u201cThe more you till, the less they have to eat,\u201d said Sharon Weyers, a soil scientist with the U.S. Department of Agriculture.A good earthworm population might number around 200 worms per square meter. An excellent population would have twice as many.\u201cIf you\u2019ve got more than 400 earthworms per meter squared, you are more likely to have best improvement in crop yield,\u201d Dr. Jones said. \u201cThe more worms you have, the better.\u201dEarthworm Watch, a collaboration of the Earthworm Society, London\u2019s Natural History Museum and Earthwatch Institute, monitors earthworms and soil health in the U.K. There is no comparable survey in the U.S., but individual research projects assess earthworm populations.To count worms, researchers dig a pit around 1 cubic foot in size, then sift through the soil by hand, or they roust worms from the ground by sending electroshocks through the soil or by soaking it with a solution of hot mustard. Irritated earthworms surface, where they can be counted.It can take a decade or more for diminished populations to rebound, Drs. Briones and Schmidt found, with populations increasing the most when the soil is disturbed the least.No-till farming, which is used on about 34% of cropland in the U.S.,\u00a0according to USDA economist Steven Wallander, is the least disruptive.Although no-till farming is theoretically possible on most cropland, the cost of changing to specialized seeding equipment may be prohibitive for small farms, which populate much of the world.John Ledermann, a third-generation Minnesota farmer who raises corn, soybeans, wheat and cereal rye, has transitioned his 1,100 acres to no till and strip tilling.His yields have been mixed, he said, but he\u2019s using about half the fuel and sees visible improvements to the soil.He recalled walking across a field at dusk one spring when he noticed movement on the ground.\u201cThe earthworms had come up,\u201d he said. \u201cAs I walked along, they were flicking back in their burrows.

The extremist fighters are cornered in Mosul\u2019s Old City and expected to lose there within weeks.\u201cWe are seeing the end of the fake Daesh state,\u201d Iraqi Prime Minister       Haider al-Abadi       said Thursday, using an Arabic acronym for Islamic State.Both the Iraqi military and the Shiite militias report to Mr. Abadi. The militias were legally incorporated into Iraq\u2019s security apparatus by parliament last year, though their top leaders have close ties to Tehran.Tal Afar had a population of about 200,000 before Islamic State took over, but the town has outsize importance because of its proximity to both Syria and Turkey. The U.S. and Turkey worry that Tehran wants its militia allies to take Tal Afar to help secure a land corridor by which Iran could move fighters and resources through Iraq into Syria, a longtime Iranian ally, and on to Lebanon, where Iran\u2019s Hezbollah proxy is based.50 miles50 kmTURKEYTal AfarIRANHasakah", "news_time": "2017-06-30 05:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/iraqs-dilemma-who-will-lead-the-next-big-fight-against-isis-1498815002", "news_title": "Iraq\u2019s Dilemma: Who Will Lead the Next Big Fight Against ISIS?", "keywords": " iran, iraq, isil, isis, islamic state, mosul, raqqa, shiite militias,tal afar, turkey,political,general news,national,public security,crime,legal action,terrorism"}, {"content": "BERLIN\u2014German lawmakers passed legislation Friday that would fine social-media companies up to $57 million if they fail to quickly delete hate speech, libel and other illegal content, one of the most aggressive efforts in the West to regulate content posted online.Alphabet Inc.\u2019s        GOOGL 0.59%       Google,             Facebook Inc.        FB 0.79%       and civil-rights groups criticized the law, warning it would stifle freedom of speech by encouraging social networks to delete controversial but legal posts. The law, some critics warned, could set the stage for authoritarian regimes to force tech firms to remove more content faster.The law, which passed with backing from German Chancellor       Angela Merkel\u2019s       governing coalition, is set to take effect Oct. 1. Large social networks such as Facebook and             Twitter Inc.        TWTR 0.70%       will be required to delete \u201cclearly illegal\u201d content within 24 hours, while having the ability to set up an industry self-regulating body for processing borderline cases within one week.The law\u2019s quick passage\u2014the bill was introduced by the Justice Ministry in March\u2014illustrated the scramble across Europe to ratchet up pressure on tech companies to remove terrorist content and hate speech. It also reflected fears among European politicians that their democracies are vulnerable to propaganda campaigns spread via social media.The new liability could test Facebook, Google and Twitter\u2019s highly automated business models by forcing them to deploy more human expertise to make judgment calls on myriad individual posts. How they tackle this challenge could, in turn, set a costly template for the policing of social network posts world-wide.\u201cWe cannot accept that social networks ignore our laws,\u201d German Justice Minister       Heiko Maas       said. \u201cThey can no longer allow their infrastructure to be abused for committing crimes.\u201dBut       Susan Benesch,        who studies ways to fight hate speech at Harvard University\u2019s Berkman Center for Internet and Society, said the 24-hour time frame set by the law would lead internet companies to process complaints using algorithms \u201cthat are not yet up to the task.\u201d\u201cThe German bill would likely push internet companies into massive, over-broad censorship,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can expect more, even more restrictive laws, in Europe and other parts of the world, especially if the German law passes.\u201dTech executives, for their part, say they already do a lot to police their platforms for hate speech and terrorist propaganda. But one executive said that the new German law would hurt those efforts by forcing companies to shift resources away from their own efforts to focus on compliance with the German law.Facebook said it already planned to increase its team examining user complaints to 7,500 from 4,500 world-wide and to more than 700 from 600 for Germany. Earlier this year, it told the German parliament that the law could lead to \u201cthe deletion of legitimate posts\u201d because \u201ceven large social networks will not be able to implement completely legally sound and effective processes to examine all complaints within the short time-frame.\u201dGoogle told the Justice Ministry that it fields 200,000 user complaints globally a day on its YouTube video platform and that the tight deadlines and potential fines would create \u201ca significant incentive to delete any content immediately after a complaint.\u201dMr. Maas countered that overzealous deletion of posts by social networks isn\u2019t a concern because internet companies have a business interest in allowing as much content as possible.\u201cSocial networks won\u2019t risk losing their users, who will surely turn away if their posts are constantly being unjustly deleted,\u201d Mr. Maas said in a statement.Mr. Maas in 2015 helped set up a voluntary program in which Facebook, Google and Twitter agreed to delete most hate speech reported by German users within 24 hours. But in March, Mr. Maas said a study commissioned by his ministry had found that Facebook and Twitter were too slow.The new legislation details 22 sections of the criminal code that social networks will have to help enforce. Among them: laws banning libel, character defamation, hate speech, insults against religions, offensive statements and privacy violations.After the recent terrorist attacks in London and Manchester, British Prime Minister Theresa May called for new regulations, and potentially fines, to force tech firms to remove terrorist propaganda more quickly from their platforms. Later in the month, she was joined by French President       Emmanuel Macron,        who called tech firms\u2019 efforts \u201cinsufficient.\u201dBut Germany\u2019s new law goes farther than any other in Western Europe by forcing tech companies to set up a system for users to flag illegal content and threatening fines for noncompliance. Until now, Brussels and other European governments have generally settled for a voluntary approach.Indeed, earlier this month, the European Union\u2019s executive arm reported improvement from those voluntary efforts, saying that tech companies had boosted removal of illegal content including terrorist propaganda 59% of the time when it was flagged for review, up from a rate of 28% six months ago.Civil-rights groups, meanwhile, say the German law will embolden undemocratic regimes to make their own efforts to require global social networks to enforce domestic laws.\u201cThis is a great opportunity for authoritarian states,\u201d said       Johannes Baldauf       of the Amadeu Antonio Stiftung, a German foundation that fights hate speech but opposes the legislation.\u2014Deepa Seetharaman  in San Francisco  contributed to this article.Write to Anton Troianovski at anton.troianovski@wsj.com and Sam Schechner at sam.schechner@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-30 05:16:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/germany-to-social-networks-delete-hate-speech-faster-or-face-fines-1498757679", "news_title": "Germany to Social Networks: Delete Hate Speech Faster or Face Fines", "keywords": " facebook, germany,google, hate speech, internet restrictions, libel,social media, social networks, twitter, youtube,Alphabet Inc.

Some former residents of the area who were evacuated following the disaster rode a 4 a.m. bus to attend Friday\u2019s hearing.\u2018Life is so hard now.\u2019\u201cTens of thousands of people were affected\u2014we had to abandon our homes, our jobs, our communities,\u201d said       Ruiko Muto,        one of 1,324 Fukushima residents who filed the original criminal complaint against 42 Tepco executives and government officials in 2012.\u201cI hope this case will help us learn what decisions were made when, and who is accountable,\u201d she said.The trial comes after prosecutors twice decided not to indict the executives, saying the failure to protect the power plant from the unlikely event of a massive tsunami didn\u2019t constitute criminal oversight. Citizen panels twice challenged that decision, triggering the trial.As of May, almost 60,000 Fukushima residents were registered as evacuees, meaning they can\u2019t return home and haven\u2019t settled permanently elsewhere.The prosecution is expected to focus on risk assessments made by Tepco, including a 2008 study that found a 15.7-meter tsunami could hit the plant. Tepco\u2019s lawyers say that study and others were simulations with various probabilities and it was unrealistic to expect the executives to have acted swiftly on them.\u201cIf Tepco had paid attention to its duty to ensure the safe operation of a nuclear power plant, shouldn\u2019t the accident have been prevented?\u201d       Hiroshi Kamiyama,        the lawyer representing the plaintiffs, said in his opening argument.He argued that Tepco should have shut the plant down until safeguards were made, even if the odds of such a tsunami were 1-in-100,000.Legal experts expect an acquittal, but say that could be years away. Following the 1986 Chernobyl disaster, the head of the nuclear power station and two aides were sentenced to 10 years in a labor camp.According to the indictments, the victims of Tepco\u2019s failure to safeguard against a large tsunami include employees and members of Japan\u2019s Self Defense Forces exposed to rubble from two hydrogen explosions, and 44 patients of a hospital who died while being evacuated to avoid the nuclear fallout.While some residents have returned to towns around the plant, many are still temporary dumping grounds for radiation-contaminated soil. The scale of the disaster has also hindered a rapid restart of resource-starved Japan\u2019s nuclear industry.\u201cLife is so hard now,\u201d said       Masaki Yoshida,        who abandoned her home and family\u2019s bamboo-charcoal business in Miyako, Fukushima, with her three children and husband. She said she is struggling to make ends meet farming in another part of the country.\u201cI want to know why this happened, why we lost everything.\u201dWrite to Mayumi Negishi at mayumi.negishi@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-30 05:10:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/nuclear-plant-chiefs-plead-not-guilty-in-fukushima-trial-1498813855", "news_title": "Nuclear Plant Chiefs Plead Not Guilty in Fukushima Trial", "keywords": "former tepco chairman trial,fukushima nuclear disaster,fukushima tepco executives,tepco executives criminal trial,tepco former executives trial,tepco fukushima trial,tepco trial,Tokyo Electric Power,9501.TO,Ichiro Takekuro,Sakae Muto,corporate crime,legal action,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,disasters,accidents,earthquakes,volcanic activity,landslides,floods,tidal waves,man-made disasters,natural disasters,catastrophes,nuclear accidents,risk news,tsunamis,energy,electricity,gas utilities,electric power generation,nuclear power generation,electric utilities,utilities"}, {"content": "Big banks cut their oil price forecasts for a second month in a row amid signs that the global crude glut would take longer to abate.Investors last week sent oil prices into a bear market as the oversupply has proved immune to the production limits set by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies including Russia. Prices rose this week but remained below $50 a barrel, or less than half of their level three years ago when the downturn started.Analysts expect low prices to last. A poll of 14 investment banks, surveyed by The Wall Street Journal in late June, predicted benchmark Brent crude would average $55 a barrel this year, down two dollars from the May survey. The banks expect West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. oil gauge, to average $52 a barrel this year, down two dollars from the previous survey.Banks in the survey also downgraded their expectations for oil prices next year, predicting Brent crude would average $57 a barrel, down two dollars from the May poll. The banks expect WTI to average $55 a barrel in 2018, down three dollars.In early trading Friday, Brent changed hands at $47.91 a barrel while WTI was $45.22 a barrel.Rising U.S. production, as well as from OPEC members Libya and Nigeria that are exempt from production caps, have added to the bearish sentiment on the market. Tepid demand growth has also undermined earlier forecasts that prices would rise sustainably this year.\u201cDisappointment about the slower-than-expected market rebalancing will keep prices depressed well into next year,\u201d said Carsten Fritsch, an analyst at Commerzbank.OPEC and 10 producers outside the cartel agreed last month to extend their deal to limit their combined output by 1.8 million barrels a day, or about 2% of global output, through March 2018. But OPEC has acknowledged that its efforts weren\u2019t working as quickly as it thought they would.Mr. Fritsch said he expects OPEC\u2019s compliance to the deal\u2014which has been close to 100% this year\u2014to fall in the next few months as low prices pressure countries that rely on oil exports for a big chunk of their revenues.\u201cOPEC\u2019s compliance will crumble soon. Low prices are causing them a lot of pain and some members will ramp up output to compensate,\u201d he said.OPEC had hoped to drain bloated global stockpiles of crude. However, oil stockpiles in the OECD, a group of industrialized countries, in April were higher than they were when OPEC agreed to its cut late last year, according to the International Energy Agency.That is partly because of the rapid increase in U.S. production in recent months. Despite lower prices, many American shale drillers continue pumping crude by focusing on their best acreage and making technological improvements. Analysts predict that U.S. output would reach a record high of more than 10 million barrels a day next year, from around 9.3 million now.On the demand side, oil consumption globally has been lackluster this year, further delaying the rebalancing.Bank of America Merrill Lynch estimates that global demand expanded by a paltry 900,000 barrels a day in the first quarter and accelerated modestly to 1.1 million in the second quarter. According to the bank, that is just half the growth rate of the last two years.\u201cDemand cannot save oil prices right now,\u201d the bank said.Write to Georgi Kantchev at georgi.kantchev@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-30 02:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/oil-price-outlook-darkens-1498802403", "news_title": "Oil Price Outlook Darkens ", "keywords": "analysts,brent,fracking,low ,oil prices,opec,output cuts,shale oil,u.s. oil output,wti,Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries,output,production,corporate,industrial news,existing products,services,product stockpile,commodity markets,energy markets,commodity,financial market news,crude oil markets,energy,crude oil,natural gas upstream operations,crude petroleum extraction,natural gas,oil extraction,oil sands,shale"}, {"content": "Investors have grown accustomed to rude shocks from China, so it\u2019s always nice to get some unexpected, encouraging news.China\u2019s June purchasing managers index (PMI) fit the bill\u2014it ticked up after stalling out for two months, in a sign that this spring\u2019s tough crackdown on financial market leverage has, so far, done limited damage to the real economy.More important, the percentage of businesses reporting stable or improving export orders hit its highest level since early 2012\u2014a bullish signal on global growth on a day when global stocks are selling off.Weakening trade data from Taiwan and Korea and faltering U.S. consumer confidence earlier in the second quarter had suggested a cautious outlook about global demand.

The selloff in oil, which some had taken as a signal of weakening growth, has also now reversed\u2014for the time being\u2014as initial signs of weaker U.S. supply growth boost sentiment.Recent China data has contained other hints that export demand remains robust: May profits in the information technology and communications sector\u2014one of China\u2019s biggest export earners\u2014ticked up for the second month in a row following a big drop in March. Year-to-date revenue growth clocked in at 14%, a touch below first-quarter growth of 15%, but still at a level not seen since early 2013.On the domestic front, signals were also broadly encouraging. Factory input prices rose again after falling in May. Factory gate prices fell, but the fall was the smallest since March.There were some discouraging signs: the PMIs for small- and medium-size enterprises were lower in May, although they still indicated growth. Smaller firms, which often need to rely on shadow banks for loans, may be feeling the pain from slower credit growth sooner than big, well-connected state firms. Manufacturing employment also weakened again. A weaker job market and tougher conditions for small firms could mean a deeper slowdown in the second half.But for now, the message from China to the world is: steady onward.Write to Nathaniel Taplin at nathaniel.taplin@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-30 01:44:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-to-markets-relax-global-growth-is-fine-1498801293", "news_title": "China to Markets: Relax, Global Growth is Fine   ", "keywords": "china analysis ,china economic analysis ,china economy,china heard on the street ,china pmi,commodity,financial market news"}, {"content": "BEIJING\u2014A gauge of China\u2019s manufacturing activity jumped unexpectedly in June on improved demand, leaving more room for Beijing to continue its crackdown on financial risks without causing instability.China\u2019s official manufacturing purchasing managers index increased to 51.7 from 51.2 in May, according to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics on Friday. The June reading, the second-highest of the year, beat a median forecast of 51.1 by economists polled by The Wall Street Journal. The index has now remained above the 50 mark that separates expansion from contraction for 11 straight months.\u201cThe expansion of manufacturing activity has accelerated,\u201d said       Zhao Qinghe,        an economist with the statistics bureau. \u201cBoth domestic and overseas demand has been recovering.\u201dA pickup in the broader economy was also reflected in the rise of the nonmanufacturing PMI, a measure of activity outside the factory gates. The index rose to 54.9 in June from 54.5 in May, thanks to improved conditions in the construction and services sectors.\u201cThe better-than-expected PMIs will give the government more leeway to continue the so-called regulatory storm for the rest of the year as Beijing has won some success in striking a balance between maintaining economic growth and cracking down on financial risks,\u201d said       Zhang Fan,        an economist with RHB Research.In responses to Chinese President       Xi Jinping\u2019s       call for financial stability ahead of a major power shuffle later this year, Chinese regulators unleashed a blizzard of new directives aimed at reining in soaring borrowing levels, with the central bank increasing a series of money-market interest rates.The moves indicate the government\u2019s resolve in tackling snowballing debt long watched as a potential threat to the stability of the world\u2019s second-largest economy. The worries over China\u2019s debt levels prompted             Moody\u2019s Investors Service                   last month to downgrade China\u2019s sovereign credit rating for the first time in nearly three decades.Beijing is still likely to meet its annual growth target of 6.5% after strong growth of 6.9% in the first quarter, but the momentum will inevitably lose some steam in the months ahead amid the regulatory crackdown, said RHB economist Zhang Fan.More than 40% of manufacturers surveyed by the statistics bureau have said for four months in a row that they have difficulty getting funding to support their productions and investment, said Mr. Zhao, the economist with the bureau. He also called for more support from the country\u2019s financial institutions.\u201cWe suspect that the current resilience of growth will prove temporary.

Recently, the rally in tech shares has shown signs of faltering. On Thursday, the Nasdaq fell 1.4%.The tech rally \u201cseems to perhaps have been played out now,\u201d said Myra Natter, wealth adviser at California-based firm Titus Wealth Management, which recently cashed in part of its large holdings of technology shares and is looking for other sectors in the U.S. stock market.\u201cWe see financials taking the lead, and we are looking at expanding allocations there,\u201d she added.On Tuesday,             Bankia SA       and Banco Mare Nostrum SA, two of Spain\u2019s state-owned banks, announced a merger designed to help the government recoup some of the taxpayer money spent in bailing them out between 2010 and 2012. Shares of Bankia, the larger of the two banks, are up around 6% this week, as investors saw the deal as a further step in the cleanup of the nation\u2019s banks.Italian authorities also said Sunday said they were willing to spend \u20ac17 billion ($19 billion) as part of the shutdown of Veneto Banca SpA and Banca Popolare di Vicenza, two banks in the country\u2019s Veneto region. Italy\u2019s FTSE Italia All-Share Banks Index is up 5.5%, around a six-week high.\u201cThat was a huge thing hanging over European equity markets and that seems to be solved,\u201d Mr. Deluard said.Banks also got a boost midweek from the Fed\u2019s stress-test results, where all 34 major U.S. financial institutions won approval to ramp up dividend payouts and share buybacks. At the close of trading Thursday, shares of             Citigroup Inc.       rose $1.80, or 2.8%, to $66.98 and             Wells Fargo                   & Co. was up $1.45, or 2.7%, to $55.78.\u201cThe Fed gave a vote of confidence in the health of the U.S. financial system,\u201d said strategists at Northern Trust.\u2018We see financials taking the lead, and we are looking at expanding allocations there.\u2019Meanwhile, central bankers in Europe, the U.K. and Canada have all hinted that monetary stimulus could start to be rolled back sooner than previously believed, raising the prospect of a steeper yield curve. Whenever long-term yields rise compared with shorter-term ones, investors expect banks to be able to profit from higher lending margins.Yields on 10-year German government bonds closed at 0.45%, their highest since March.Even in Japan, where 10-year bond yields are anchored roughly at zero, lenders\u2019 shares have climbed around 3% this week.Globally, \u201cit\u2019s still not great, but it seems we\u2019re seeing light at the end of the tunnel as far as negative rates go,\u201d said Mr. Deluard. \u201cThe yield curve is marginally improving, and that\u2019s a great thing, but it\u2019s hard to see us go back to what we had before the crisis,\u201d he said.Economic growth was robust across developed nations in the first half of the year, but subdued inflation has raised some concerns about a potential slowdown ahead and the ability of policy makers to lift interest rates from deep lows.Since the beginning of the year, sectors that are less exposed to economic growth, such as utilities, have regained some ground over riskier ones: The FTSE index for defensive stocks in developed economies is up around 12% this year, compared with a roughly 10% rise for cyclical stocks.Meanwhile, analysts have raised earnings per share estimates for banks in the first half of the year, according to FactSet.Still, some investors are less convinced the sector is poised to take off. \u201cEarnings growth is OK, valuations are OK\u2026but loan growth has not been great, and that\u2019s kind of important,\u201d said       Michael Thompson,        managing director at S&P Global Market Intelligence, who sees the sector trading roughly in line with the wider market through the end of the year.Particularly in the U.S., it looks less likely that banks will benefit from long-term returns grinding much higher, analysts say. Even after this week\u2019s rise, 10-year Treasury yields are still at 2.3%, when they were at 2.6% in March.\u201cI think low inflation will keep the Fed at their gradual pace,\u201d said       Eric Souza,        senior portfolio manager at SVB Asset Management.Corrections & Amplifications   \u20ac17 billion converts to about $19 billion.
