[{"content": "Turns out, there is some appetite for all that packaged food for sale.McCormick        MKC -5.22%       & Co. said it agreed to acquire             Reckitt Benckiser Group        RBGLY 1.82%       PLC\u2019s food division, whose brands include French\u2019s mustard, for $4.2 billion, the latest in a wave of deal activity in the global packaged-foods sector.The transaction comes three months after the U.K. company put its food unit up for sale. Analysts at the time estimated that it could be worth $2.5 billion to $4 billion.The agreement also comes amid a flurry of planned sales or strategic reviews of well-known packaged food brands across an industry looking to cut costs and insulate itself from slowing sales. Many companies are trying to change their product mixes as consumers move to healthier or locally produced options. Low inflation has made it difficult to raise prices to make up for sluggish volume growth in many markets.That has triggered a number of strategic reviews among big food firms. Unilever PLC, the Anglo-Dutch consumer-goods behemoth that earlier this year rejectedKraft Heinz Co.\u2019s       $143 billion takeover bid, has said it is planning to unload its margarine-and-spreads business. Switzerland\u2019s             Nestl\u00e9 SA       last month put its U.S. confectionery business up for sale.All of those assets on the market\u2014at a time when the global packaged-food industry is facing headwinds on several fronts\u2014raised questions about whether sellers might be able to unload their businesses at attractive prices.But recent deals\u2014including the agreement late Tuesday\u2014suggest there are still plenty of strategic buyers willing to pay top dollar for good assets.In April, cereal giant             Post Holdings Inc.       agreed to buy Weetabix Food Co., maker of the breakfast brand, for \u00a31.4 billion ($1.83 billion). Post faced several other bidders for the brand, which China\u2019s Bright Food Group Co. and Baring Private Equity Asia had put on the block.Bright bought its 60% stake in Weetabix in 2012 for \u00a31.2 billion but never succeeded in turning it into a hit in Asia. Still, the price Bright ultimately got from Post translated into a higher multiple over adjusted earnings than some had expected.Reckitt\u2019s food business, called RB Foods, was seen as one of the most attractive on the block in recent months. French\u2019s is America\u2019s best-selling yellow mustard. RB Foods other brands include Frank\u2019s RedHot sauce and Cattlemen\u2019s barbecue sauce.Reckitt said it wasn\u2019t core, as it puts more emphasis on its home and personal-care offerings. In February, Reckitt agreed to acquire baby-food maker Mead Johnson Nutrition Co. for $16.6 billion.RB Foods generated just \u00a3411 million ($536 million) of Reckitt\u2019s overall revenue of \u00a39.89 billion in 2016. But its operating margins\u2014considered close to 27% last year\u2014are considered high for packaged food.Sparks, Md.-based McCormick, whose current brands include Lawry\u2019s and Grill Mates, said it expects combined 2017 annual net sales of about $5 billion. It also projects the deal will generate cost savings of around $50 million, the majority of which will be achieved by 2020.Though McCormick\u2019s leverage ratio will increase because of the deal, the company plans to maintain its dividend policy but curtail its share-buyback program in an effort to maintain its investment-grade credit rating, it said. Reckitt said it intends to use the proceeds from the deal to reduce its debt.Write to Chip Cummins at chip.cummins@wsj.com and Keith Collinsat keith.collins@wsj.comAppeared in the July 20, 2017, print edition as 'Food Deals Promise to Turn Red Hot.'", "news_time": "2017-07-20 03:11:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/spice-maker-mccormick-adds-frenchs-mustard-to-its-shelf-in-4-billion-deal-1500440567", "news_title": "Spice Maker McCormick Adds French\u2019s Mustard to Its Shelf in $4 Billion Deal", "keywords": "cattlemen's,consumer,deal,foods,frank's redhot hot sauce,french's mustard,mccormick,reckitt benckiser,McCormick,MKC,Reckitt Benckiser Group,RB.LN,UK:RB.,Baring Private Equity Asia,Bright Food Group,Post Holdings,POST,Kraft Heinz,KHC,Nestle,NESN.EB,NESN.VX,Weetabix Food,Mead Johnson Nutrition,RB Foods,Unilever,UK:ULVR,ownership changes,acquisitions,mergers,shareholdings,marketing,markets,corporate actions,branding,corporate,industrial news,divestments,soap,cleaning products,food,beverages,tobacco,condiments,sauces,consumer goods,food products,nondurable household products"}, {"content": "Collectors spooked by last year\u2019s economic and political tumult are filtering back to the big auction houses, where they are vying with an influx of newcomers for blue-chip art.The resulting global market looks increasingly healthy, although categories such as rare books and Russian art are in less demand than hot commodities like contemporary and Asian works.On Tuesday, London-based auction house Christie\u2019s International offered further proof of the market\u2019s strength when it said it sold \u00a32.4 billion (roughly $3 billion) of art during the first half of 2017, up 14% in pounds from a year ago but flat when converted to U.S. dollars. Christie\u2019s auctioned $2.8 billion in art, also up 14% from the first half of last year. Christie\u2019s additionally sold $155.4 million worth of art in privately brokered deals.Rival             Sotheby\u2019s,       based in New York, said it auctioned $2.5 billion in art during the first half, up 8% from the year before. Both auction houses said the six-month totals represented sales through June 30. Sotheby\u2019s is scheduled to release its consolidated sales, which include private art sales, next month.Both houses had an easier time wrangling masterpieces to sell this season, with Christie\u2019s selling 38 works for more than \u00a310 million apiece, or $13 million, during the first half of the year, compared with 14 during the same period the year before. Christie\u2019s also said it saw a 29% boost in the number of new collectors who paid seven figures or more for a single work of art, suggesting new buyers are muscling swiftly toward the upper reaches of the market.Christie\u2019s priciest work during the first half was Constantin Brancusi\u2019s $57.4 million bronze head, \u201cSleeping Muse,\u201d which sold in May to art adviser Tobias Meyer. Also in May, it also sold Cy Twombly\u2019s abstract, \u201cLeda and the Swan,\u201d for $52.9 million. In June, it sold Vincent van Gogh\u2019s 1889 \u201cThe Reaper (After Millet)\u201d for $30.9 million.Sotheby\u2019s sold Jean-Michel Basquiat\u2019s untitled turquoise painting of a skull to Japanese collector Yusaku Maezawa for $110.5 million in May, the most expensive painting auctioned during the first half of the year. The work also set a new auction record for a U.S. artist. Sotheby\u2019s other hits included a $24 million Roy Lichtenstein 1995 portrait of a \u201cNude Sunbathing\u201d and a 59.60-carat oval pink diamond. The gem sold to Hong Kong jeweler Chow Tai Fook for $71.2 million, a record for a diamond at auction.Collectors are showing renewed confidence by taking home a higher-than-usual percentage of the goods on offer at both houses. Typically, an auction is considered successful if at least 80% of the offerings find buyers. This spring, Christie\u2019s said it found buyers for 81% of its goods across the board, compared with a 79% sell-through rate for the first half of 2016. Sotheby\u2019s said it found takers for a robust 90% of its offerings in its $151.5 million jewelry sale in Geneva in May.Both houses continue to persuade collectors to bid online, with Christie\u2019s conducting 35 online-only sales during the first half of the year. The web auctions were led by a $3 million sale of American art in May that drew 14,000 viewers. Chief Executive       Guillaume Cerutti       said 44% of those viewers were new to his company, making these online-only sales \u201ca primary channel for recruiting new clients.\u201dAmong the categories, Christie\u2019s $770 million in contemporary art exceeded Sotheby\u2019s $767 million in new art sales for the first half. However, Christie\u2019s lost some ground by canceling its traditional June sale of contemporary art in London. Mr. Cerutti said the decision \u201cwill pay off\u201d if the staff can renew its efforts to sell more art in Hong Kong, its third art hub after New York and London.Christie\u2019s excelled in other areas. It said it sold $889 million worth of impressionist and modern art, American art, modern British art and Latin American art during the first six months of 2017. The sum represents a 43% jump from last year but is down from $1.3 billion two years ago. Sotheby\u2019s didn\u2019t give a combined total for these categories but said it had sold $701 million worth of impressionist and modern art alone in the first half of 2017, up 25% from a year ago.Christie\u2019s struggled in the categories of old master paintings, Russian art and 19th-century art, with combined sales of $81.2 million, down 37% from a year earlier. Yet its sales of Asian art were up 77% to $548.2 million during the first half, helped by a $263 million sale of Chinese art from Japan\u2019s Fujita Museum in March that included Chen Rong\u2019s $49 million scroll painting, \u201cSix Dragons.\u201d The house also sold a celadon-green Yongzheng amphora for $18 million in Hong Kong in May.Collectors from the U.S. and Asia outspent all rivals this spring, each winning 35% of Christie\u2019s offerings. Christie\u2019s sold $1.5 billion worth of art in the U.S., up 39% from a year ago.The art market tends to quiet down in late July and August but will get tested anew at sales this fall in London, Hong Kong and New York.Appeared in the July 19, 2017, print edition as 'newcomers dive into the Art MarkeT\u2019s high end.'", "news_time": "2017-07-19 01:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/newcomers-muscle-into-art-markets-high-end-1500440400", "news_title": "Newcomers Muscle Into Art Market\u2019s High End", "keywords": "Christie's International,financial performance,earnings,sales figures,corporate,industrial news,art,art collecting,auctions,political,general news,arts,entertainment,retail,wholesale,specialty stores,art dealing,auction houses,real estate,construction"}, {"content": "Broad gains in U.S. stocks sent major indexes to a trio of records Wednesday.The Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&P 500 and the             Nasdaq Co      mposite hit new highs, with all 11 sectors of the S&P 500 posting gains.

They came of age watching news about email hacking during the last presidential election and malware hurting companies. Some have seen friends struggle with identity theft. Now they want to flex their brainpower to prevent such abuses in a world that is increasingly online.Beatrice Karp, a 16-year-old from Larchmont, N.Y., aims to join the military and is fascinated by the \u201cwar on keeping things secure,\u201d she said. \u201cThe combination of computer science and serving my country would be the best thing ever.\u201dShe joined 44 other young women in a free three-week camp this month at the NYU Tandon School of Engineering that aims to attract more of them to a specialty that is in great\u2014and growing\u2014demand.Women make up 11% of the information security workforce globally, according to report this year from Frost & Sullivan, a consulting group. The study said demand for staff with these skills far outstrips supply, and projected a shortage of 1.8 million cybersecurity professionals world-wide by 2022.Summer camps devoted to this specialty have popped up in recent years as public and private sector experts called for a stronger pipeline of talent. The National Security Agency and National Science Foundation, for example, are jointly sponsoring 131 \u201cGenCyber\u201d camps for students and teachers in kindergarten through 12th grade across the country this summer, up from seven camps in 2014.The Computer Science for Cyber Security camp for high-school students at NYU started five years ago with government funding, and now relies in part on philanthropy to cover its roughly $60,000 costs.Several teen girls said they were often one of the few females in a computer science class or club full of boys.\u201cI\u2019ve looked to break some gender barriers,\u201d said Hui Min Wu, a 15-year-old from Brooklyn who is the second female vice president of her robotics team at Stuyvesant High School.\u201cCybersecurity seems pretty intimidating for women like us to go into,\u201d she added. \u201cYou\u2019re kind of afraid of the men that are in the field, you\u2019re afraid of how they\u2019ll accept a woman into their company and into their network, but I want to change that.\u201dThey are studying how to write and decipher encrypted messages and how to find hidden files on computers.

They can also use the device to broadcast what they are viewing back to others for real-time instruction.The product\u2019s previous version cost $1,500. The price of the new product will vary based on the needed software customization, customer support and training, the company said.The Wall Street Journal previously reported that Google was targeting companies, quietly distributing the new glasses to partners in 2015 for testing.Google has struggled with privacy concerns in recent years as both regulators and consumers took a closer look at its usage of data stemming from search results, email and its initial release four years ago of Glass.That version of the glasses prompted a widespread privacy backlash because users could record video in public places without others noticing.Google sold the device to the public in mid-2014, but sales were small amid complaints about privacy, technical shortcomings and a lack of obvious uses. Executives have since admitted that the device was released before it was ready for consumers.

Its fate was left unclear in the document released by the Trump administration on Monday.In its negotiating blueprint, the administration said it wanted not only to secure rights for U.S. investors in Canada and Mexico, but also to prevent investors from those countries from gaining rights in the U.S. that domestic firms don\u2019t have.\u00a0The document didn\u2019t specify what should happen to the current system, and a\u00a0spokeswoman for\u00a0U.S. trade representative       Robert Lighthizer       had no immediate comment.At a House of Representatives subcommittee hearing Tuesday, businesses and the AFL-CIO, America\u2019s largest labor federation, pointed to the ambiguity in the administration\u2019s blueprint. Corporate executives pressed to retain the current settlement process as a way to defend their investments abroad, while the AFL-CIO urged removing the provision, which they say favors companies over workers and undermines national court systems.American businesses point to research saying they sometimes face discriminatory treatment abroad compared with local businesses and therefore require an international arbitration system.\u201cIt\u2019s not academic, it\u2019s for real,\u201d       Dennis Arriola,        executive vice president for strategic development at Sempra Energy                  , told the House hearing Tuesday. \u201cWe had an experience in Argentina where overnight the government changed the rules and regulations.\u201d Sempra challenged Argentina under a similar provision in a bilateral pact with that country.The chief executives of railroad             Kansas City Southern                   and engine maker             Cummins Inc.       also backed the arbitration process in the hearing as a way to protect their investments in Mexico.Labor leaders and some Democratic lawmakers see the arbitration as a green light that encourages American companies to invest in production\u2014and create jobs\u2014abroad because they are exposed to fewer legal risks.\u201cI see no evidence that we can\u2019t trust Canadian courts,\u201d       Celeste Drake,        an AFL-CIO trade expert, told a House trade panel on Tuesday. The Sierra Club also said Monday it opposed the arbitration provision.The U.S. has never lost an arbitration with a foreign investor under the Chapter 11 provision. Canada\u2019s         TransCanada Corp.       used the provision to sue the U.S. after the Obama administration didn\u2019t grant a permit for the Keystone XL pipeline. TransCanada suspended that case after Trump lifted U.S. objections to the project. Companies can sue governments for monetary damages but can\u2019t overturn laws or regulations through the process.\u2018I see no evidence that we can\u2019t trust Canadian courts.\u2019Lawmakers and congressional aides say the Trump administration is still deliberating its stance on key Nafta issues, including the arbitration system, as it heads into negotiations with Canada and Mexico that are expected to begin next month. Provided the three sides can reach an agreement, it needs to be ratified by a majority in the House and Senate, as well as by the parliaments of Mexico and Canada.\u201cI think they\u2019re still in the process of trying to figure out what\u2019s the best way to proceed in protecting American companies overseas,\u201d said Rep.       Dave Reichert       (R., Wash.), who chairs the House trade panel.The Obama administration disappointed many Democratic lawmakers by including a revised version of the arbitration provision\u2014with added safeguards to prevent frivolous claims\u2014when it negotiated the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP. Mr. Trump rejected TPP, which hadn\u2019t been ratified by Congress, on his first working day as president.A senior U.S. trade official indicated a desire in March to \u201cmaintain and seek to improve procedures to resolve disputes between U.S. investors and Nafta countries,\u201d according to a draft letter to Congress viewed by The Wall Street Journal.In June congressional testimony, Mr. Lighthizer, the U.S. trade representative, said he was \u201ctroubled by the sovereignty issue\u201d with regard to the arbitration provision. Still, he said he supported the \u201clegitimate interest\u201d of American firms to have their rights protected abroad and backed further congressional consultations before making a final decision on the arbitration provision.Write to William Mauldin at william.mauldin@wsj.comAppeared in the July 19, 2017, print edition as 'Arbitration Emerges as Nafta Flashpoint.'", "news_time": "2017-07-19 00:01:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/arbitration-provision-emerges-as-flashpoint-in-nafta-overhaul-1500408335", "news_title": "Arbitration Provision Emerges as Flashpoint in Nafta Overhaul ", "keywords": " dispute settlement mechanism,nafta, nafta renegiation,North American Free Trade Agreement,Kansas City Southern,KSU,Cummins,CMI,Sempra Energy,SRE,TransCanada,TRP,trade,external payments,physical trade,economic news,political,general news,international relations,politics,railroads,credit types,services,technical services,architects,surveyors,business,consumer services,banking,credit,real estate,construction,financial services,road,rail transport,transportation,logistics"}, {"content": "People in counties that propelled President       Donald Trump\u2019s       election victory see him as the change agent needed to shake up political and economic systems that they said are stacked against them, a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll found.The president\u2019s job performance and his handling of the economy are viewed more favorably in these so-called Trump counties than in the rest of the nation, helping to overcome doubts some people have about the president\u2019s personal qualities and some of his policy decisions.The GOP president draws wide support in these counties for bargaining with employers to keep jobs in the U.S., with 75% of residents supporting those efforts and 14% opposing.More than two-thirds of respondents in those counties back his signaling that he is willing to take action if North Korea goes further in developing long-range missiles and nuclear weapons, and a similar share backs his military response in April to Syria\u2019s use of chemical weapons. A majority supports his push for a ban on entry into the U.S. residents of some countries.In these counties, 50% said they approve of Mr. Trump\u2019s job performance, compared with 46% who disapprove, the survey found. That is a stronger showing than the 40% in a nationwide Journal/NBC survey from last month who approved of Mr. Trump\u2019s performance in office.The survey underscored many of the themes that led to Mr. Trump\u2019s surprising victory in November, most notably the resonance of his call to protect U.S. jobs and the unfavorable view that many voters took of Democratic presidential nominee       Hillary Clinton.The survey, conducted July 8-12, included 600 adults in some of the president\u2019s strongest bastions: Counties that flipped from favoring former President       Barack Obama,        a Democrat, in 2012 to backing Mr. Trump in November, and counties in which Mr. Trump\u2019s support in the November election surged at least 20 percentage points higher than GOP presidential nominee       Mitt Romney       drew in 2012.The interviews were conducted in 16 states: Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Iowa, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Wisconsin.Approval of some of the president\u2019s actions related to the economy and foreign policy in these counties have helped him overcome doubts about other actions. According to the poll, 42% in these counties disapproved of his firing of       James Comey       as director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, with 33% approving. Nearly half disapproved of Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to pull the U.S. out of the Paris climate change accords, with about one-third approving of that action.More than half disapprove of Mr. Trump\u2019s push to replace the Affordable Care Act, and more than six in 10 disapprove of his use of             Twitter.\u201cWithout a doubt, Donald Trump\u2019s personal style was part of his appeal in the 2016 campaign,\u201d said Democratic pollster Fred Yang, who conducted the survey with Republican Bill McInturff. \u201cBut more and more it appears to be a distraction that is starting to hit a sour note with this base.\u201dMany poll respondents said Mr. Trump\u2019s strongest attribute was that he isn\u2019t a typical politician and is shaking things up in Washington. He is perceived as bringing the right kind of change by more than a two-to-one ratio.Asked how Mr. Trump may have fallen short of expectations, respondents most often cited the statement that \u201che keeps keep making personal attacks that set a bad example.\u2019\u2019Views of Mrs. Clinton were unfavorable in the counties surveyed.In those counties that backed Mr. Trump after supporting Mr. Obama four years earlier, Mrs. Clinton\u2014whom the president continues to criticize now that he is in office\u2014is viewed positively by 30% and negatively by 50%.Among independents in all of the\u200b counties surveyed, Mrs. Clinton is viewed positively by 16% of adults. Meanwhile, some 41% of these same independent voters hold favorable views of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s primary-election rival, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont.Mr. Sanders is viewed positively by 42% of respondents in all of the counties surveyed, about the same share as for Mr. Trump and well ahead of the 27% who view Mrs. Clinton favorably.\u201cIt says that the Bernie Sanders\u2014and whatever he represents, and if he\u2019s part of a particular progressive group\u2014has not somehow alienated this whole key group of Americans,\u201d said Democratic pollster       Peter Hart,        who worked on the survey. \u201cThat sends a message to Democrats.\u200b\u201d\u200bIn many ways, the survey shows that Mr. Trump\u2019s election messaging still resonates with voters, Mr. Yang said.About 70% of residents in the counties surveyed said they don\u2019t feel confident that life for their children will be better than their own, and 55% said the nation\u2019s political and economic systems are stacked against them.Asked about Mr. Trump\u2019s criticism of the media as \u201cfake news,\u201d a plurality of people in these counties\u200bsaid they opposed that kind of language. But for people who said they like Mr. Trump, support for \u200bhis attacks on the media was 66 percentage points higher than those who opposed it.Some of the president\u2019s policies, particularly on trade and foreign affairs, have also united Republicans and Democrats in these counties.\u201cThere are several elements of the Trump agenda, especially on the economy and foreign policy, where he has the bipartisan support his administration is currently missing\u201d in Washington, Mr. Yang said.The Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll was based on telephone interviews with 600 adults and has a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.Write to Michael C.
