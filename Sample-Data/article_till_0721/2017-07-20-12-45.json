[{"content": "PepsiCo Inc.\u2019s        PEP 0.47%       longtime leader       Indra Nooyi       is promoting one of her lieutenants to serve as the company\u2019s president, filling a No. 2 role that has been vacant for nearly three years and shuffling around her potential successors.Ramon Laguarta, currently head of the company\u2019s Europe and sub-Saharan Africa business, will become PepsiCo\u2019s president, a headquarters role covering global operations, corporate strategy, public policy and government affairs.His current duties will be given to       Laxman Narasimhan,        who runs the snack-and-beverage giant\u2019s Latin America division. Both appointments will take effect Sept. 1.In an interview, Ms. Nooyi, 61 years old, said she intends to keep running the Purchase, N.Y.-based company \u201cfor the foreseeable future.\u201d The two promotions are the latest in a series of moves over the past few years to \u201cstretch\u201d executives and prepare them to be contenders for the top job, she said. The company\u2019s division heads will continue to report to her.PepsiCo, which has a market value of about $165 billion, has been using higher prices, smaller packaging and a broader portfolio to help boost results amid shifting consumer tastes that are pressuring the packaged food and beverage industries. Despite falling soda demand and other industry challenges, the company\u2019s profit margins are rising and shares are trading near all-time highs.During Ms. Nooyi\u2019s 11-year tenure, two potential successors have been promoted to the No. 2 role of president and subsequently left the company. The job has been vacant since the 2014 departure of       Zein Abdalla.Ms. Nooyi, who was CFO and president before she was named chief executive in 2006, said Mr. Laguarta shouldn\u2019t be presumed her successor. She took over as chairman in 2007 and led the spinoff of             Yum Brands Inc.       as well as acquisitions of Tropicana and Quaker Oats. She has fended off calls to break up the company and pushed into healthier snacks and beverages.\u201cThere is no heir apparent,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen the time comes for succession, whenever it is, I think the wonderful thing is our board is going to have so many people to choose from.\u201dThe leading internal candidates to succeed Ms. Nooyi now include Mr. Laguarta, Mr. Narasimhan and       Hugh Johnston,        PepsiCo\u2019s chief financial officer, who in 2015 was named vice chairman and put in charge of e-commerce and information technology.Mr. Laguarta, 53, a native of Barcelona, joined the company in 1996 and has spent most of his career rising through the ranks of the European operations. He has an MBA from Spain\u2019s ESADE business school. He speaks English, Spanish, French, German, Greek and Catalan and will relocate to the U.S. from Geneva in his new role.Mr. Narasimhan, 50, was a senior partner at McKinsey & Co. where he spent 19 years before joining PepsiCo in 2012. He was senior vice president and CFO of PepsiCo Americas Foods before rising to Latin America chief in 2014.Ms. Nooyi said she wanted Mr. Laguarta, whom she called \u201ca great operating executive,\u201d to gain experience at the corporate headquarters, where his mandate will be to grow sales and productivity to fund investments, she said.For Mr. Narasimhan, she said she wanted to push him to \u201clift and shift ideas\u201d across his two geographic divisions to accelerate their growth. She said he has \u201cevolved from brilliant strategist to a very good operating executive.\u201dAs Mr. Laguarta takes on some of Ms. Nooyi\u2019s responsibilities, she said she would shift her focus to PepsiCo\u2019s future. Letting other executives \u201ccome into their own, but being there as a helping hand, is my job at this point,\u201d she said.Write to Jennifer Maloney at jennifer.maloney@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-20 08:03:00", "keywords": "ceo,executives,management,president,sales,PepsiCo,PEP,Indra Nooyi,plans,strategy,management moves,corporate,industrial news,senior level management,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,food,beverages,tobacco,soft drinks,drinks,consumer goods,non-alcoholic beverages", "news_title": "PepsiCo CEO Picks a No. 2, but No \u2018Heir Apparent\u2019", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/pepsico-ceo-picks-a-president-but-no-heir-apparent-1500552001"}, {"content": "Policy makers at the European Central Bank haven't yet discussed the future of their bond-purchase program after its tentatively scheduled end in December, but will do so in the fall, ECB President       Mario Draghi       said Thursday.Investors have been looking for further clues as to the future of the program following hints from Mr. Draghi in a speech late last month that it may be time to consider a reduction in stimulus as growth accelerates.But in a news conference on Thursday after the central bank left its policies unchanged, Mr. Draghi said the program\u2019s future had not yet been debated by the 25-member governing council during their two-day meeting in Frankfurt.\u201cWe were unanimous in setting no precise date for when to discuss changes in the future,\u201d he said. \u201cIn other words, our discussions should take place in the fall, or in the autumn, since we are in Europe.\u201dTheir next opportunity will come at a meeting in early September, followed by a gathering in late October.Mr. Draghi said policy makers agreed they will need more information about the eurozone\u2019s economic outlook before reaching any conclusions, and noted new forecasts from the central bank\u2019s economists will be available in September.\u201cWe need to think, we need lots of information we don\u2019t have today, there is a lot of uncertainty,\u201d he said.Mr. Draghi also said the euro\u2019s recent appreciation against the U.S. dollar and other currencies had received \u201csome attention\u201d during the meeting.In a statement, the ECB reiterated its readiness to bolster its bond-buying program should economic conditions worsen. Mr. Draghi said that was intended to ensure investors don\u2019t assume the program will be quickly wound down, leading to a rise in borrowing costs before the ECB judges that is needed.\u201cThe last thing we may want is an unwanted tightening of conditions,\u201d Mr. Draghi said.Mr. Draghi\u2019s comments suggest the governing council will be very cautious when it approaches the question of when and how quickly to start winding down its stimulus programs.\u201cWhile Draghi had raised the prospect of potentially removing some extraordinary policy measures in the not too distant future, today\u2019s meeting seems to have again focused on the subdued inflation pressures in the eurozone and the need for ongoing policy support,\u201d said Brendan Lardner, a money manager at State Street Global Advisors.Some analysts and investors have argued that the government bonds the ECB wants to buy will become increasingly scarce as 2018 progresses, given the size of the program to date. But Mr. Draghi said the ECB had previously found ways to continue with the program by changing its terms, an indication that he sees no immediate limit to its duration.\u201cWhen the governing council needed flexibility to carry through its monetary policy, it was successful in finding it,\u201d he said.The eurozone economy is healthier than it has been since the financial crisis. After outpacing the U.S. in the first quarter, the bloc\u2019s economy might have grown by 3% on an annualized basis in the three months to June. Unemployment is falling, and consumer and business sentiment indicators are at multiyear highs.But there are reasons for the central bank to think twice before deciding to cut back on the stimulus it has been providing since mid-2014. The annual rate of inflation has slipped back in recent months, and stood at just 1.3% in June, its lowest level in 2017 and well short of the central bank\u2019s 2% target. Moreover, the ECB\u2019s economists don\u2019t expect inflation to rise to the target in 2018 and 2019 if bond purchases end in December.Mr. Draghi noted that the economic recovery has gained pace, but said there are few signs that inflation is picking up.\u201cWe reviewed the economic developments in the euro area, where we took stock of the continuing improvement in growth momentum, but also of the fact that the inflation rate is still subdued,\u201d he said.Some ECB watchers have detected a slight change in emphasis from the ECB over recent months, as it appeared to look more to strengthening economic growth as a guide to policy than still weak inflation.But Mr. Draghi said no such shift has taken place, another indication that any change in policy will be as gradual as the expected pickup in price rises.\u201cOur mandate is neither growth nor employment, it\u2019s price stability,\u201d he said. \u201dThat\u2019s what our monetary policy is geared for.\u201dNevertheless, Mr. Draghi said policy makers are confident that stronger growth will ultimately lift inflation, even if that process appears to be taking longer than it would have before the financial crisis.\u201cThe conclusion we draw\u2014with great caution\u2014is that in the end yes, we will go back to a relationship like we had before the crisis,\u201d he said.The ECB buys \u20ac60 billion ($69 billion) a month in mostly government bonds. The program is due to run until the end of the year, but most economists expect the ECB to end the program only gradually\u2014or taper\u2014starting in January.In remarks given late last month at a conference in Sintra, Portugal, the ECB chief surprised markets by seeming to open the door to a gradual tapering of quantitative easing. Mr. Draghi\u2019s message there was that given strong economic data, the ECB could need to tighten policy slightly to maintain the same level of support to the economy.Write to Paul Hannon at paul.hannon@wsj.com and Todd Buell at todd.buell@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-20 10:51:00", "keywords": " ecb bond buying program,ecb interest rates, ecb quantative easing, ecb tapering,European Central Bank,Mario Draghi,economic performance,indicators,inflation,prices,euro zone,currency,economic news,banking,credit,financial services", "news_title": "ECB to Discuss Future of Bond-Buying Program in the Fall", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/ecb-reiterates-commitment-to-bond-buying-program-1500551922"}, {"content": "Hedge-fund managers for years accumulated offshore gains without paying federal and state taxes. Now Uncle Sam is going to get paid.Steven Cohen       is\u00a0one of many managers\u00a0preparing\u00a0to write\u00a0huge checks\u00a0in early 2018\u00a0due to\u00a0a crisis-era decision\u00a0to close\u00a0a tax loophole that long benefited\u00a0some of\u00a0Wall Street\u2019s wealthiest investors.The billionaire founder of SAC Capital Advisors LP\u00a0amassed deferred offshore income of more than $1 billion likely subject to\u00a0the\u00a0taxation, said people familiar with the matter.\u00a0Other hedge-fund managers facing personal tax bills of over $100 million include       David Einhorn       of Greenlight Capital Inc. and       Daniel Loeb       of\u00a0Third Point LLC, said people familiar.Total payments from all managers could amount to $25 billion, according to\u00a0a 2008\u00a0estimate from the Joint Committee on Taxation. Some tax specialists say the bill could be even higher: $100 billion or more.This will likely mean a surge of tax revenue for Connecticut, historically the center of the hedge-fund industry. The state isn\u2019t yet sure how much it will reap, said a spokesman for the governor\u2019s budget office.\u201cAny projection would be too speculative to be reliable,\u201d the spokesman said.Hedge-fund\u00a0managers\u00a0are considering a variety of steps to raise cash or soften the tax blow. Some\u00a0will trim stakes in their funds to raise cash, says Brett Barth of hedge-fund investor BBR Partners LLC.Hedge funds often invest\u00a0through\u00a0vehicles\u00a0based inside and outside the U.S. They make money from their cut of 20% or more of trading profits.For decades, the Internal Revenue Service allowed managers of offshore funds to defer receipt of this compensation and both avoid an immediate tax bill and grow the savings tax-free. The IRS generally permits businesses to allow executives to defer compensation because such deferrals lower the firms\u2019 compensation costs, forcing them to pay higher taxes on profits. That offsets income taxes not immediately paid by employees.But this practice cost the Treasury income in the case of offshore hedge funds that don\u2019t pay any offsetting U.S. taxes.Managers\u00a0in some cases let those deferred trading fees compound\u00a0tax-free\u00a0for 10 years or longer.\u00a0Some also deferred management fees, even as\u00a0they amassed large fortunes from gains earned by their U.S.-based funds.\u201cThey kept rolling and rolling the money,\u201d says Richard Zarin, a partner at Morgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP.The             New York Times                   in 2007 highlighted this loophole, and Congress overwhelmingly voted to close it the following year as a way of raising revenue and stabilizing the financial sector during the 2008 financial crisis. The change, part of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of October 2008, was made in section 457A of the IRS code.The legislation gave managers a decade to pay taxes on money accumulated before the law changed. That deadline is now nine months away.The deferred fees\u00a0will be taxed at ordinary tax rates that can be close to 50% depending on where the managers live and work,\u00a0according to tax experts.\u201cThese are smart, aggressive people who don\u2019t want to pay more than they have to and writing a huge check can be quite demoralizing,\" said\u00a0Jonathan Brenner, a tax partner\u00a0at Caplin & Drysdale. \u201cMost recognize they\u2019ve had a good run and now have to pay the piper, though not after first asking six different ways if there\u2019s some silver bullet\u201d to eliminate or reduce the taxes.Mr. Cohen, who ran SAC Capital before it pleaded guilty to criminal insider-trading charges in 2013, is nearing a launch of a new firm to manage as much as $20 billion, The Wall Street Journal earlier reported.He has set that target, which would exceed the $16 billion managed at peak by SAC, partly because he wants to generate income to help pay the large tax bill, a person close to him said.Other\u00a0fund managers\u00a0are shifting headquarters to Florida to mitigate the tax impact, said a local official. Florida doesn\u2019t have a state income tax\u00a0on personal income.\u201cEven four or five years ago they saw this coming, they knew they\u2019d bring money back in and needed to be in a state with lower taxes,\u201d said       Kelly Smallridge,        president of the Business Development Board of Palm Beach County.Those moves are no guarantee of a smaller tax\u00a0bite\u00a0because states\u00a0generally examine where and when deferred compensation was earned, experts say.\u201cPeople have been banging on our doors since the provision was enacted looking for a solution and we still have clients coming in, but one hasn\u2019t been found,\u201d\u00a0says Mr. Brenner. \u201cEvery tax lawyer who touches hedge funds has had these kinds of calls\u2026there\u2019s\u00a0frustration among some clients that a solution has not been found.\u201dSome charities\u00a0say\u00a0managers anticipating a tax bite\u00a0are discussing donations\u2014to receive an immediate tax deduction\u2014rather than handing money to\u00a0the government.Other\u00a0managers are turning to charitable lead annuity trusts, said       Henry Bregstein,        an attorney at Katten Muchin Rosenman LLP. These trusts give a donor an upfront deduction of 100% as well as the opportunity to transfer to heirs,\u00a0free of gift and estate tax,\u00a0the trust\u2019s remaining value at the term\u2019s end after making annual, fixed distributions to charities.Eileen Heisman, chief executive officer of National Philanthropic Trust says her organization is speaking to roughly 50 fund managers about establishing donor-advised funds by the end of year, three-times the usual pace. She attributes the increase to the looming tax bills.Such funds make grants to charities on behalf of donors after they contribute assets, enabling immediate tax deductions. Assets can be invested and grow tax-free even before the charities are chosen.Sometimes, these funds can be invested in the manager\u2019s own funds, with restrictions, Ms. Heisman says.\u201cThere\u2019s no way of knowing how much\u201d money will be paid in taxes or how much will be shifted to charitable organizations, says Ms. Heisman. \u201cBut we think it will be very large.\u201dWrite to Gregory Zuckerman at gregory.zuckerman@wsj.com and Rob Copeland at rob.copeland@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-20 05:30:00", "keywords": "Greenlight Capital,SAC Capital Advisors,Third Point,David Einhorn,Steven Cohen,government finance,government budget,taxation,sub-national,local budget,economic news,banking,trusts,funds,financial vehicles,financial investments,investment banking,alternative investments,credit,financial services,hedge funds,investing,securities", "news_title": "Loophole Closed: Hedge-Fund Managers Prepare Huge Tax Checks", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/loophole-closed-hedge-fund-managers-prepare-huge-tax-checks-1500543002"}, {"content": "When       Gary Lebbin       turns 100 years old in September, hanging over any celebration will be one very costly fact: His life insurer aims to cancel two policies totaling $3.2 million in death benefits.The Lebbin family has run up against a provision that exists in many life-insurance policies. Policies have expiration dates, and the one in the Lebbin family\u2019s two contracts is age 100 for the policyholder.It is a standard feature of permanent life insurance, a product combining a tax-deferred savings component with a tax-free death-benefit. The provision calls for the termination of the death benefit and payout of all of the built-up savings when the policyholder reaches the specified age.The limits weren\u2019t an issue in the many decades when very few people lived beyond 100. But they increasingly are a problem for the U.S. life-insurance industry as more people become centenarians. There were an estimated 53,364 centenarians in the U.S. as of 2010, up from 37,306 in 1990 and 32,194 in 1980, according to a U.S. Census report published in December 2012.Since the mid- to late-2000s, the industry has used age 121 as the standard maturity date in new contracts. But an unknown number of older contracts with the 100-year-old limit remain in consumers\u2019 hands. Some insurers previously offered older policyholders the opportunity to extend the age in their older policies with varying financial terms.The Lebbin family\u2019s insurer, a unit of Transamerica Corp., didn\u2019t offer an extension.Lawrence Rybka,        president of insurance brokerage Valmark Financial Group in Akron, Ohio, worries many people may unexpectedly lose out. At least seven people have recently contacted his firm with questions about older policies with maturity dates of 95 to 100 years. \u201cContract language of this type was common practice,\u201d he said.Faced with the potential loss of coverage, Mr. Lebbin\u2019s family filed suit in federal court in Maryland earlier this month, accusing Transamerica of knowingly using a too-low age at the time of sale in the early 1990s. The suit also alleges the insurer improperly marketed the policies as \u201ccoverage for life.\u201dThe federal-court lawsuit says the Lebbins paid Transamerica more than $1.5 million in premiums over the years. It seeks revision of the contracts to allow coverage until Mr. Lebbin\u2019s death. It also seeks an award including punitive and other damages.In a statement, Transamerica, a unit of the Netherlands\u2019s             Aegon                   NV, says it acted properly.\u201cWe understand that Mr. Lebbin is disappointed that his life insurance coverage will shortly come to an end. However, his policies, according to their terms, pay benefits only if he were to pass away before the policies\u2019 anniversaries nearest age 100\u2026We take seriously our obligations to the millions of customers who rely on the solutions we provide and we abide fully by the terms and conditions of our policy contracts,\u201d according to the statement.In terminating the policy, Transamerica said it would pay Mr. Lebbin the built-up \u201cnet cash value,\u201d or savings. That is as per contractual terms.It is unclear how much cash value there is, said       James Bainbridge,        a lawyer for the family. Industrywide, many of these policies have performed poorly in recent years because interest buildup is tied to the insurers\u2019 bond investments, and low interest rates have had a punishing effect. Upon termination of the policies, the Lebbin family would collect less money and potentially pay taxes, while a future $3.2 million death benefit would be tax-free, Mr. Bainbridge said.\u201cTransamerica has a public-relations problem because it didn\u2019t think ahead and offer policyholders like these\u201d options at an earlier stage to deal with the looming age issue, said       Todd Erkis,        a former chief actuary at             Lincoln National Corp.       and a visiting professor at St. Joseph\u2019s University.Ironically, policy maturity dates were born as a way to help consumers get a reasonable value out of a policy after years of ownership but before a death, said       Paul Graham,        a senior actuary with the American Council of Life Insurers. To calculate monetary values and set annual premium levels, \u201cyou have to have an end point,\u201d he said.By the mid 2000s, a new mortality table was available that established 121 as the new maturity age to help prevent an abundance of policies maturing before death, according to Mr. Graham.\u201cThe agents didn\u2019t want the policies maturing before people were dying, the companies didn\u2019t want it happening, and policyholders didn\u2019t want it happening,\u201d he said.The policies taken out by the Lebbins are called universal life. They are a popular form of permanent life insurance. Permanent life stands in contrast to basic \u201cterm\u201d life, which is sold to provide a payout if a death occurs within a specified period of time, usually 10 to 30 years.The suit alleges Transamerica marketed the policies as coverage that would insure the Lebbins for life and would guarantee they would have tax-free income with which their heirs could pay estate taxes. The lawsuit maintains that Transamerica established the maturity date with a 1980 mortality table \u201cdespite the fact that it was outdated and not an accurate reflection of the actual life expectancies of its customers.\u201dThe Lebbins became aware last year of Transamerica\u2019s intention to terminate the policies and unsuccessfully sought an extension of the contracts until Mr. Lebbin\u2019s death, the lawsuit says.Mr. Lebbin was born on Sept. 6, 1917, in Berlin. He came to the U.S. in 1938 to escape Nazi persecution, according to his son-in-law       Phillip Spector.      \u00a0From arriving penniless, he founded a paint-manufacturing business in the 1940s and ultimately had more than 50 retail outlets in the Baltimore-Washington area.He married in 1944. Bernice Lebbin died in 2015.\u201cCentenarians are cherished and routinely honored by local communities and governments,\u201d said Mr. Bainbridge, the lawyer. \u201cCentenarians, however, are problematic for the life-insurance industry.\u201dWrite to Leslie Scism at leslie.scism@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-20 07:00:00", "keywords": "Gary Lebbin,Lawrence Rybka,commodity,financial market news,insurance,life insurance,financial services", "news_title": "Happy 100th Birthday!
