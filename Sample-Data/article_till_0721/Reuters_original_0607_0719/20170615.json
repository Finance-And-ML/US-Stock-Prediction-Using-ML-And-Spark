That was clear from the get-go on Wednesday night, when the first three Red Sox batters collected hits -- and instead of boos from a Philly crowd known for them, it was more cheering than jeering coming from the announced crowd of just over 28,000. The change in cities certainly didn't make a difference in outcome, as the Red Sox downed the Phillies for the third straight game, scoring five runs in the first two innings and coming away with a 7-3 victory on Wednesday night. Mookie Betts powered the Boston offense, going 4-for-5 with two home runs, three RBIs and four runs scored. In falling a triple short of the cycle, the right fielder raised his average to .280 while becoming the first Boston player this season with double-digit home runs (11) Both home runs were solos -- one in the fourth inning and one in the ninth for his team's final two runs of the night. Related CoveragePreview: Red Sox at PhilliesBoston Red Sox - PlayerWatchPhiladelphia Phillies - PlayerWatch I'm just putting a lot of work in, just trying to trust my ability and trust the work that I've put in,  Betts said.  Seeing a couple balls fall in gives some confidence, and we go from there.  It's the eighth win in 11 games for Boston, moving the Red Sox a season-best nine games above .500 (37-28). Their last three have come against the MLB-worst Phillies (21-43), who saw their losing streak extended to eight.  When things aren't going good, as a starting pitcher, I think we put a little too much pressure on ourselves,  said Phillies starter Jeremy Hellickson, who took the loss for the fourth time in five starts.  I've just got to get back to work and try to figure some stuff out, just get back to being consistent and giving us a chance.  After the teams played 11 innings on Monday and 12 on Tuesday in two games in Boston, the Red Sox tried to make sure early on that no more than nine innings would be needed as the matchup continued a couple hundred miles down I-95. Boston plated two runners in the first inning and three in the second against Hellickson (5-5), getting an RBI double from Xander Bogaerts in the first and a two-run single from the shortstop in the second to open a 5-0 lead. Boston starter Brian Johnson, who cruised through the first two innings in 23 pitches, didn't make it out of the third Wednesday night. The left-hander, making his fourth start of the season at the major league level, gave up three runs and four hits during a span of six batters in the third inning, including a two-run homer off the bat of Phillies right fielder Aaron Altherr that cut it to 5-3. Johnson departed because of  discomfort  in his throwing shoulder after the next batter doubled.  He felt some increasing stiffness and the inability to get loose with each successive inning here tonight until in the third inning he had to come out,  Red Sox manager John Farrell said.  Hopefully, we caught it early enough, so it isn't a severe situation.  Red Sox reliever Hector Velasquez (1-1) was stout in relief, pitching 3 1/3 innings of scoreless ball to come away with his first career victory. Hellickson made it through the first batter of the sixth inning, giving up a double to Sandy Leon, before he was pulled after 93 pitches as he struggled yet again. He gave up six runs and nine hits, walking three while striking out one, blaming an inability to locate his fastball properly with getting hit hard right out of the game. That has been a recurring problem of late. Since ending April with a 4-0 record and a 1.80 ERA, Hellickson is 1-5 with a 6.89 ERA.  The last month and a half has been pretty frustrating,  he said.  Sprinkled a couple good (starts) in there, but I just pride myself on being consistent and giving us a chance to win every night, and I haven't done that too often the last seven or eight starts.  NOTES: The Phillies and Red Sox conclude their four-game, two-city series Thursday, with Boston RHP Chris Sale (8-2, 2.97 ERA) going up against Philadelphia rookie RHP Nick Pivetta (1-3, 5.52). ... Phillies 1B Tommy Joseph extended his hitting streak to 10 games with a third-inning double. He's batting .375 during that span. ... Boston relievers have not given up a run in their last 21 1/3 innings. ... The Phillies are 0-8 in interleague play this season. Since interleague play began in 1997, Philadelphia's 153-200 record is the third worst in baseball.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-redsox-phillies-writethru-idUSMTZED6FKITH0V"},

Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain have broken off ties and imposed sanctions on Qatar, accusing it of supporting terrorism and courting regional rival Iran - allegations Doha denies.  We do not want any differences between our brothers in the GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) countries, and it is not enough to say that there is a problem without trying to resolve it,  Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu told the Qatari news agency QNA on arrival.  Turkey seeks to resolve the unprecedented crisis between brotherly countries in the GCC.  President Tayyip Erdogan has cultivated close ties to Qatar, setting up a military base there, while preserving relations with Saudi Arabia. Cavusoglu was due to meet Qatar's Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, and Qatar's state run pan-Arab news channel Al Jazeera said his next stop would be Kuwait, which has also been seeking to mediate in the dispute. Turkey and Qatar have both provided support for the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt - a broad movement whose Islamist goals are anathema not only to Egypt's ex-military president, Abdul Fattah al-Sisi, but also to the Gulf's dynastic rulers. Related CoverageTwo U.S. Navy vessels arrive in Doha for joint exercise -Qatar news agencyQatar signs $12 billion deal to buy F-15 jets from U.S.U.N. agency to assess airspace closure against Qatar, host talksConservative Gulf neighbors have long viewed Qatar's foreign policy with suspicion, especially its refusal to shun Shi'ite Iran, and resented Al Jazeera for its readiness to air unwelcome or dissenting views from across the region. The Gulf Arab states have not made public their demands of Qatar, but an Al Jazeera journalist shared on Twitter a list that includes Qatar severing diplomatic ties with Iran and expelling members of the Palestinian Islamist Hamas group and the Muslim Brotherhood who live in Doha. The list also includes ending support for  terrorist organizations  and ceasing  interference  in Egyptian affairs, charges that Qatar denies.  Quick Results  Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry told reporters in Cairo that the conditions set for Qatar were necessary for the national security of Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the UAE, the Egyptian state news agency MENA reported.  This move will bring concrete, quick and decisive results,  he said.  Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, trying to ease fears, told reporters in Berlin he does not expect a military conflict. French President Emmanuel Macron, visiting Morocco, called for de-escalation of tensions in the Gulf crisis. He said he would hold talks with leaders of Saudi Arabia, UAE and Qatar. Qatar has a population of 2.7 million people and vast gas wealth. The sanctions have disrupted imports of food and other materials and travel, and they have caused some foreign banks to scale back business. Before the diplomatic and commercial embargo, Qatar imported 80 percent of its food from bigger Gulf Arab neighbors. It has been talking to Iran and Turkey to obtain food and water. Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir, speaking after talks in Washington with U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Tuesday, said the sanctions did not amount to a blockade since Qatar's airports and ports remained open, and offered to send food and medical supplies to Qatar if needed. Qatar said the Saudi offer confirmed that the closure of transport links  is a siege, not a boycott. At Qatar's Hamad port on Wednesday, workers were busy unloading containers of food and building materials, while another ship carrying livestock, including chickens and sheep from Australia, was at the quayside.  There is a service from India ... which used to come via Jebel Ali port (in the United Arab Emirates) but is now redirected,  said a port official who declined to be named.  The first vessel on that service is to arrive Friday and will run once a week.  The effects of the dispute are rippling out beyond the region. Qatar said it had withdrawn troops from the frontier between the east African states of Djibouti and Eritrea, where it has been acting as mediator in a border dispute. It gave no reason, but Djibouti had earlier downgraded its diplomatic ties with Qatar.

Brandon Drury's RBI single, his fifth hit in a string of six at-bats, finished a two-run first inning and Taijuan Walker plus two relievers made it stand up Wednesday night to give the Arizona Diamondbacks a 2-1 victory over the Detroit Tigers, who have now lost six of their last eight games.  We're winning one-run games on the road,  Arizona manager Torey Lovullo said,  and I think that's what teams do when they play into the end of the season and have meaningful games. We're doing a lot of things right. I'm very pleased with that.  We came in here (Tuesday) and won a tough game. We did it a little backwards (blowing a 6-0 lead and winning 7-6), I know, but this time we won a one-run game against a very offensive team and I'm very happy about that.  The Diamondbacks don't have that glossy big-name starter but their handwoven rotation has been generally solid and their bullpen has been excellent. The right-handed Walker (5-3) was making his first start since May 19 due to a blister on his pitching hand and lasted five innings, allowing six hits, a run and walk while striking out six. Related CoveragePreview: Diamondbacks at TigersArizona Diamondbacks - PlayerWatchDetroit Tigers - PlayerWatchHe threw 82 pitches and allowed Detroit's only run, which came in the third on an RBI single to left by Alex Avila after Ian Kinsler had doubled to extreme left field for the Tigers' first hit. Walker allowed two hits in both the fourth and fifth before giving way to Randall Delgado, recently bumped to the bullpen due to the D-backs having three days off in a span of nine days.  I thought Taijuan was very good,  Lovullo said.  His first day back and all very encouraging. He got to the pitch count that we wanted him to. He gave us five really, really good innings. The rest of the guys picked up from there.  Randall comes in and gets things under control real quickly. He had I think a 9-pitch and an 11-pitch for his first two innings, went out in the third and had to wriggle out of a little bit of a situation but we made a nice defensive play to get a big out and Fernando once again did a great job.  Randall can change speeds, change locations with just about anybody that we have. Delgado gave up just one baserunner in his three innings of work, a one-out single to Miguel Cabrera in the eighth. Fernando Rodney earned his 18th save for a scoreless ninth as Arizona (41-26) equaled its best record after 67 games set in 2002.  They pitched really well,  Detroit catcher Alex Avila said.  It was a little frustrating that we couldn't get that big hit to put us over them.  Jordan Zimmermann (5-5) gave up two runs on four hits in the first plus a leadoff single in the second but retired batters 14 in a row before allowing his sixth hit. Zimmermann's slider was exceptional after the first and he faced one over the minimum from the second through the eighth.  When he commands his off-speed stuff, in particular his slider, he can work his fastball to both sides,  Avila said.  Occasionally when he does miss with his fastball he can get away with it because they're honoring his off-speed stuff.  That was the best he's thrown by far, I think. It's taken him awhile to get to this game. But again, that's part of baseball. That's part of being human.  Gregor Blanco opened the game with a single for Arizona and made it all the way to third when left fielder Justin Upton muffed the ball for an error. David Peralta, whose ninth-inning home run won Tuesday night's game, hit a sacrifice fly to score Blanco. A single by Paul Goldschmidt, a two-out double by Chris Owings and Drury's ground RBI single to left made both runs earned.  I'm going to give us a lot of credit for being ready and taking advantage of a couple of key moments,  Lovullo said.  I thought the key at-bat for us was the two-out base hit that gave us our second run.  Give (Zimmermann) some credit; he shut us down. I think at one point it was 14 in a row. He looked like he had a real good blend of a fastball/slider combination that kept us in check.  NOTES: LHP Steve Hathaway of Arizona, out all season with left shoulder inflammation, will undergo arthroscopic surgery June 19 with no timetable for a return. ... Tigers 1B Miguel Cabrera has not hit a home run since May 20 and two since May 2 but manager Brad Ausmus professes not to be concerned  in any way shape or form. I wish I struggled to hit .270.  ...

Deepening political turmoil in Washington also weighed on the greenback and U.S. Treasury yields, with the Washington Post reporting that U.S. President Donald Trump is being investigated by special counsel Robert Mueller for possible obstruction of justice. Also on Wednesday, a prominent Republican was among those shot by a gunman said to be angry with Trump. The dollar index, which tracks the U.S. currency against a basket of six rivals, was slightly lower on the day at 96.915 though above its overnight low of 96.323 plumbed after downbeat economic figures. The Fed raised interest rates a quarter percentage point to a target range of 1.00 percent to 1.25 percent on Wednesday, as expected, and gave its first clear outline on its plan to reduce its $4.2-trillion bond portfolio. But the moves were overshadowed by inflation and retail sales data earlier in the day that fell short of market expectations. The core rate of inflation increased at just 1.7 percent on year, the fourth straight monthly deceleration and the slowest overall pace in two years. The Fed said a recent softening in inflation was seen as transitory, but the latest tepid price readings made investors question its view that the U.S. economy is continuing to improve. Against its Japanese counterpart, the dollar shrugged off earlier losses and was flat at 109.54 yen, above Wednesday's eight-week low of 108.81 yen. The euro was also unchanged at $1.1217, below a seven-month peak of $1.1296 scaled overnight. U.S. 10-year Treasury yields were last at 2.134 percent, below their U.S. close of 2.138 percent. They fell as low as 2.103 percent following the downbeat data, their lowest since Nov. 10. The Fed also mapped out a very gradual approach to shrink its $4.2-trillion holdings of Treasury- and mortgage-backed assets that would allow it to begin as early as September. The process could start  relatively soon,  Fed Chair Janet Yellen said.  There is a lot to digest, and even some apparently conflicting signals, such as the fact that the Fed revised its own inflation outlook slightly down and yet kept its intention to raise rates again this year,  said Mitsuo Imaizumi, Tokyo-based chief foreign exchange strategist for Daiwa Securities. The Fed said it expects U.S. inflation to be at 1.7 percent by the end of this year, down from the 1.9 percent previously forecast.  It remains to be seen if the Fed can really do both this year - raise rates again, and also begin reducing its balance sheet,  Imaizumi added. A Reuters poll of 21 of the 23 primary dealers that do business directly with the Fed showed 14 of them now believed it would announce the start of its balance sheet normalisation at its Sept. 19-20 policy meeting. The rest of them said it would make such a move at its Dec. 12-13 meeting. They said they expected Fed policymakers to raise interest rates one more time by the end of 2017 and then three times in 2018.  Investors believe that it is going to take the Fed some time to confirm that inflation is strong enough to raise rates again, and in the meantime, the Fed is going to start reducing its balance sheet at a gradual pace,  said Kumiko Ishikawa, FX market analyst at Sony Financial Holdings in Tokyo.  In this climate, there are no incentives to buy the dollar,  she said. On Friday, the Bank of Japan is widely expected to keep its monetary policy unchanged, and reassure markets it will lag the Fed in tapering its massive stimulus programme, as Japan's inflation remains low despite a strengthening economy. BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda is also seen dispelling market speculation that the central bank is engaging in  stealth tapering  by stressing that the recent slowdown in its Japanese government bond buying is simply the result of a stable bond market, according to sources familiar with the BOJ's thinking. The Australia dollar rose 0.2 percent to $0.7605, moving back toward its 2-1/2-month high of $0.7636 hit on Wednesday, after a better-than-forecast employment report. But the New Zealand dollar skidded 0.8 percent to $0.7213 , moving away from the previous session's four-month high of $0.7319. Data showed that New Zealand's economy grew 0.5 percent in the three months to March, lower than the 0.7 percent growth forecast in a Reuters poll and well below the central bank's forecast for 0.9 percent growth.

Fitch Ratings has affirmed China United Property Insurance Company Limited's (CUPI) Insurer Financial Strength Rating (IFS) at 'A-' (Strong). The Outlook is Stable. KEY RATING DRIVERS The rating is based on CUPI's ownership by China Orient Asset Management Co., Ltd. (COAM, A/Stable), which adds a one notch uplift to Fitch's standalone assessment of CUPI.  The standalone assessment reflects CUPI's improving regulatory solvency buffer, its competitive edge in agricultural insurance, the use of reinsurance to mitigate underwriting volatility and its record of operating profitability. The rating also recognises the company's volatile operating result, competitive pressure on its primary business of motor insurance and higher financial leverage. CUPI is ultimately owned by COAM, which controls CUPI through its 51% shareholding in China United Insurance Group Company Limited (CUIG), which in turn has a 87.93% shareholding in CUPI. Fitch expects COAM, a state-owned entity, to provide support via asset management and capital to CUPI as the insurer continues to grow. CUPI has adequate capitalisation and leverage. The company's comprehensive solvency ratio calculated under China's Risk Oriented Solvency System (C-ROSS) improved to 291% at end-2016, from 213% in the previous year. CUPI issued CNY6 billion in subordinated debt to strengthen its regulatory capital position in 4Q16, however, this increased its financial leverage to about 31% at end-2016 (end-2015: zero leverage). The company's capital buffer, as measured by the capital score computed by Fitch's Prism Factor-Based Capital Model (Prism FBM), and net premium leverage remains small, despite the improved solvency adequacy. The company's Prism FBM capital score was still in the 'adequate' category at end-2016, while its net premium leverage in 2016 was about 2.7x, which is weaker than the median guideline for IFS 'BBB' rated non-life insurers. Fitch views CUPI's financial performance and earnings as strong, despite its underwriting volatility. The company reported a decline in its 2016 underwriting margin, partially due to claim payments from a severe fire in 2013 following the conclusion of a lawsuit. Nonetheless, its average combined ratio over the previous three years was 98.9%, stronger than the IFS 'A' rated insurer median guideline. The implementation of commercial motor insurance pricing deregulation also weakened its 2016 underwriting result. CUPI's combined ratio increased to 102.8%, from 99.2% in 2015. CUPI has stopped underwriting commercial used-motor insurance policies with poor underwriting results to improve business quality. CUPI is China's fifth-largest non-life insurer, with a 2016 market share of 4.2% by total direct written premiums. The company has actively participated in underwriting policy-supported agricultural insurance since its establishment in 1986. Fitch expects CUPI to continue to be the core earning source for CUIG. CUPI continues to rely on reinsurance to support its underwriting capacity and alleviate its catastrophe exposure, given its business focus and capital base. The company ceded out about 7% of its premiums to a portfolio of reinsurers with sound credit quality. Most of its lead reinsurers carry an IFS Rating of at least 'A-'. CUPI's risky asset exposure remains manageable, although it has further increased its exposure to less-liquid alternative investments. Investments in trust schemes, infrastructure debt schemes, wealth management products and funds managed by insurers' asset management companies accounted for about 32% of its investments and 114% of its shareholders' equity at end-2016. RATING SENSITIVITIES Downgrade rating triggers include: - a dramatic change in the ownership structure, with COAM losing its controlling stake in CUPI through CUIG; - deterioration in CUPI's capital score, as measured by Fitch's Prism Factor-Based Capital Model (Prism FBM), to below 'adequate' or a comprehensive solvency ratio, computed under China's Risk Oriented Solvency System, lower than 200% for a prolonged period; - weaker underwriting profitability, with a combined ratio consistently higher than 103%, for a sustained period; or - an escalation in the company's financial leverage to above 35%. An upgrade is unlikely in the near term, given CUPI's small capital buffer as measured by its Prism FBM score and its credit metrics. Over the medium term, rating upgrade triggers include: - an improved capital score in terms of the Prism FBM to 'strong' or higher; - strengthened operating stability, with a combined ratio below 97% on a sustained basis; and - financial leverage maintained at below 25%.

The Competition Commission of India in its order alleged that Hyundai Motor India Limited (HMIL) contravened competitive practices by imposing certain arrangements upon its dealers including monitoring the maximum permissible discount level and mandating the use of recommended lubricants and oils. The penalty has been levied at 0.3 percent of Hyundai Motor India's average relevant turnover of the preceding three years, the anti-competition watchdog said.  For the purposes of determining the relevant turnover for the impugned infringement, revenue from sale of motor vehicles alone have been taken into account,  the watchdog said, adding the final order was passed on the basis of information provided by the dealers.

The Fed raised interest rates on Wednesday for the second time in three months, lifting its benchmark lending rate by a quarter percentage point to a target range of 1 percent to 1.25 percent. The central bank also forecast one more rise this year.  The rate hike was completely expected. The interesting thing, though, were the other figures out last night, the CPI numbers, which were very ordinary,  said James McGlew, executive director of corporate stock broking at Argonaut.  But Janet Yellen then sort of confused the market by saying it is the labour market that she has got her eyes on, and the labour market in the United States is particularly strong at the moment.  Australia shares saw a broad-based sell-off, falling 1.2 percent, or 67.60 points, to 5,766.30 by 0240 GMT. The benchmark had ended near one month highs on Wednesday after four straight sessions of gains. The Aussie dollar, however, jumped to a near two-and-half month high after upbeat jobs data, which reinforced the case for a stable interest rate outlook domestically. Energy and basic materials shares were among the worst performers on the index as commodities and oil prices remained stressed. Mining giants BHP and Rio Tinto were off 2.8 percent and 3 percent respectively, while iron-ore miner Fortescue shed about 2.2 percent. Woodside Petroleum and Oil Search were about 2 percent and 3.7 percent lower. Banks, which led the gains in the past two sessions, were down on profit-taking. Australia's four biggest banks were the top losers on the main board, falling 0.8 percent to 2.6 percent. New Zealand's benchmark S&P;/NZX 50 index rose 0.2 percent, or 14.94 points, to 7,500.27. A two percent rise in fuel supplier Z Energy's shares drove the energy sector up, while telecom and consumer staples shares also gained as Spark New Zealand rose 0.8 percent, while healthcare products distributor EBOS Group added 1.5 percent. Fianancials stocks, however, were the biggest drag on the main index as Westpac and ANZ's New Zealand-listed shares lost over 1.2 percent each.

He has created tensions with Mexico's government with accusations that the country is sending criminals north and a pledge to build a wall along the U.S. southern border. The Miami summit was the brainchild of U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary John Kelly, who will be joined by Vice President Mike Pence.  Trump will be in Miami beginning Friday, although not at the same meeting. Instead, he is expected to address future U.S.-Cuba policy. Related CoverageIDB, Central America line up $2.5 billion of infrastructure plansAccording to a draft document between the United States and Mexico after consultation with Northern Triangle countries, the first day of the meeting will focus on  prosperity , and the second on security. On the second day, the document mentions a memorandum of understanding between USAID and the Carlos Slim Foundation to  focus on training to support the professionalization of crime and violence prevention units throughout Central America and enhance economic opportunities for at-risk youth.  Consulted on the matter, the charitable arm of Mexican tycoon Slim said it was in talks with USAID, but gave no further details. Slim, one of the world's richest men, is one of the main telecoms providers in Central America, with business interests across various industries throughout the region.

Picture taken October 22, 2016.Daniel Becerril/File PhotoKelly, who previously ran U.S. Southern Command, helped former President Barack Obama design his Alliance for Prosperity, a $750 million initiative that sought to curtail migration with development and gang-fighting projects. Reuters has reported Kelly aims to retool the Obama-era alliance without a large increase in U.S. funding, by pressing Mexico to take more responsibility for governance and security in Central America, and with more private capital. Trump's 2018 budget proposal envisages slashing U.S. aid to Guatemala by almost 40 percent from 2016, while cutting aid for Honduras and El Salvador nearly a third. Slideshow (2 Images)Kelly's DHS referred all questions on the document to the State Department, which did not immediately reply to requests for comment. Neither did Mexico's foreign ministry. The foreign ministries of Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The meeting envisages a commitment to develop a regional migration observatory to slow the flow of Central Americans heading north to the United States.  Tracking and collection of data around migratory flows originating from Northern Triangle countries is critical to better develop and direct policy to mitigate illegal migration,  the document says. The meeting will include efforts to deepen coordination and professionalize regional crime-fighting and law enforcement, while Washington would reaffirm its support for a free press and independent graft-tackling bodies like Guatemala's CICIG.  The United States expects Northern Triangle nations to show  a will to pursue cases that reach political and economic elites,  said the document.  The  prosperity day  aims to come up with strategies to cut red tape, boost tax revenues in Central America and improve a regional power network, allowing Mexico to sell more electricity to the energy-poor region. Still, a senior Mexico official, speaking on condition of anonymity, feared the Miami meeting would yield few concrete results other than  good intentions.

The Paris-based OECD, a rich-country think tank, also backed the Reserve Bank New of Zealand's proposal to add debt-to-income limits on home loans to its policy toolkit amid concerns over high household borrowing and rising house prices. OECD Chief Economist Catherine Mann said New Zealand's robust economic growth was  enviable , but stressed the need to tackle labour productivity that lagged its OECD peers.  Improving productivity growth is a major long-term challenge for improving inclusiveness and living standards,  Mann said in a report. The OECD is projecting slightly weaker growth than the New Zealand government, allowing for differences in the forecast periods. The OECD saw growth at 3.1 percent for both 2017 and 2018 calendar years, while the New Zealand government has forecast growth of 3.7 percent for 2017/18 and 3.5 percent for 2018/19. New Zealand's statistics agency said on Thursday the economy grew by 0.5 percent in the three months to March. The number was lower than the 0.7 percent growth forecast in a Reuters poll of economists and well under the central bank's forecast for 0.9 percent growth. The OECD said the New Zealand government should reduce barriers to foreign investment, lower the corporate tax rate and introduce research and development tax credits to tackle low productivity. Mann told reporters at a briefing in Wellington that debt-to-income limits on home loans would need to be deployed carefully, but could help ease pressures in New Zealand's strong housing market that pose systemic risks.  House price-to-income ratios being at this highly elevated level warrant some concern,  she said. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) said earlier this month said there would be  significant net benefits  in adopting DTI limits. It is seeking feedback on DTI limits by Aug. 18. New Zealand's housing market has soared more than 50 percent in value over the last decade, raising concerns that high mortgage debt could pose a systemic risk in the event of a sharp downturn in property prices. The RBNZ already requires investors to make a 40 percent downpayment on investment properties, after ramping up loan-to-value restrictions (LVR) in 2016. The measures have helped slow the rate of house price growth in recent months, but the central bank has said any resurgence in prices could be a worry. New Zealand's national household debt-to-income ratio stands at 168 percent, above most other OECD member countries, the IMF said in a report last month.

Also souring sentiment was a Washington Post report that U.S. President Donald Trump is being investigated by a special counsel for possible obstruction of justice. By midmorning, the Nikkei was down 0.6 percent at 19,762.71, after briefly flirting with positive territory earlier. The U.S. central bank raised interest rates to a range of 1.00 to 1.25 percent as expected, and gave its first clear outline on its plan to reduce its $4.2-trillion bond portfolio. Fed policy makers also signalled they were likely to raise rates once more this year. But the rate hike was overshadowed by poor inflation and retail sales data.  The market is relieved that the big event has passed. But the result left the market with lots of questions after weak U.S. economic data,  said Takuya Takahashi, a strategist at Daiwa Securities. Consumer prices unexpectedly fell on month in May and the annual increase in core CPI slipped to 1.7 percent, the smallest rise since May 2015, after advancing 1.9 percent in April. Retail sales fell 0.3 percent last month - the largest fall since January 2016 and way below economists' expectations for a 0.1 percent gain.  It is difficult for investors to imagine that the U.S. economy will recover from the first quarter and inflation will rise anytime soon,  Daiwa's Takahashi said. Exporters were mostly weak after the dollar dropped to an eight-week low of 108.81 yen overnight before recovering to trade at 109.56 yen. Toyota Motor Corp dropped 1.0 percent, while Honda Motor Co shed 0.5 percent. Shares of banks, which hunt for higher yielding products, also lost ground after U.S. yields fell. Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group and Mizuho Financial Group both declined 1.4 percent. Bucking the trend was Nintendo Co, soaring 3.5 percent to 35,980, a level not seen since January 2009, extending its gains after it announced on Twitter the previous day that it would release Super Mario Odyssey for Switch on Oct. 27. The broader Topix dropped 0.5 percent to 1,583.42. (Editing by Jacqueline Wong)","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/japan-stocks-midday-idUSL3N1JC1FZ"},

Reproduction or retransmission in whole or in part is prohibited except by permission. All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitchâs factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitchâs ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed. The information in this report is provided âas isâ without any representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or   a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to print subscribers. For Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan and South Korea only: Fitch Australia Pty Ltd holds an Australian financial services license (AFS license no. 337123) which authorizes it to provide credit ratings to wholesale clients only.

In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed. The information in this report is provided âas isâ without any representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the report.

Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue.

Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt cut diplomatic and transport ties with Qatar a week ago, accusing it of fomenting regional unrest, supporting terrorism and getting too close to Iran, all of which Doha denies. The International Civil Aviation Organization, a U.N. agency that regulates international air travel under the Chicago Convention, said it would host talks of ministers and senior officials from Qatar, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Egypt at its Montreal headquarters on Thursday to seek a  consensus-based solution  that addressed  current regional concerns.    ICAO is presently reviewing requests from the government of Qatar to assess the flight restrictions imposed upon it by neighboring states,  according to an ICAO statement. Most of the officials attending the meeting are expected to be transport ministers, according to an ICAO representative. ICAO, which was created after the United States invited more than 50 allies to agree to a common air navigation system in 1944, has no policing powers and has to rely on consensus to enforce its will. ICAO's decision to intervene in the Gulf airspace dispute is a rare instance of the U.N. body directly attempting to settle a row between states.  We are working bring these states together towards a solution which satisfies both their current regional concerns and the global needs and expectations of passengers and shippers,  ICAO said. The United Arab Emirates and Qatar have long been major proponents of open-skies air transport agreements which remove restrictions on flying between states. These policies helped the region's largest airlines, Emirates, Etihad Airways and Qatar Airways, to develop their home airports as hubs linking passengers traveling between the east and west. The UAE's General Civil Aviation Authority said it was fully committed to the Chicago Convention but reserved the sovereign right under international law to take any precautionary measures to protect its national security if necessary, UAE state news agency WAM said.  Saudi Arabia on Tuesday said the closure of its airspace to flights from Qatar was within the kingdom's sovereign right to protect its citizens from any threat.

U.S. District Judge James Boasberg in Washington said the Army Corps did not adequately consider the effects of a possible oil spill on the fishing and hunting rights of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe.  Operations of Energy Transfer Partners LP's (ETP.N) pipeline have not been suspended but that could be considered at a later date, the order said. The $3.8 billion line began interstate crude oil delivery in May. The parties are expected to meet Boasberg next Wednesday to discuss future steps. The Standing Rock Sioux are expected to argue that pipeline operations should be halted. The judge said in a 91-page decision that, while the Army Corps substantially complied with the National Environmental Policy Act, federal permits issued for the pipeline violated the law in some respects, saying in a court order the Corps did not  adequately consider the impacts of an oil spill on fishing rights, hunting rights, or environmental justice.    To remedy those violations, the Corps will have to reconsider those sections of its environmental analysis upon remand by the Court,  the judge said.  The tribe had sued the Army Corps over its approval of the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline in North Dakota, arguing the line could contaminate their water source, the Missouri River.  We applaud the courts for protecting our laws and regulations from undue political influence, and will ask the Court to shut down pipeline operations immediately,â Standing Rock Sioux Chairman Dave Archambault said in a statement. It was unclear whether the judge would agree that the line should be shut. Independent research firm Clearview Energy Partners of Washington D.C. noted in a comment late on Wednesday that Judge Boasberg's order pointed to  omissions  in the Corps' analysis, which the Corps may be able to address quickly, rather than larger errors that might require more study.  We think that the Corps may be able to persuade the court to allow Dakota Access to continue operating while the omissions are addressed and the court reviews them for adequacy,  they wrote.      ETP was not immediately available for comment. In February, the Army Corps of Engineers granted the final easement needed to finish the controversial pipeline, which had been delayed for several months after protests led by the Standing Rock Sioux tribe and climate activists. The controversial pipeline needed a final permit to tunnel under Lake Oahe, a reservoir that is part of the Missouri River.  Two previous arguments by the Standing Rock tribe - that the construction had threatened sacred sites, and that the presence of oil in the pipeline would damage sacred waters, had been rejected by the court. President Donald Trump issued an executive order days after being sworn in directing the Army Corps to smooth the path to finishing the line, prompting complaints by the tribe and environmental groups that it had not done an adequate environmental review.

The Muslim holy month, due to end in late June, is half over, and how much shopping Indonesians do during Ramadan is regarded as a reliable sign of the mood in an economy where private consumption accounts for 57 percent of gross domestic product.  I will be shopping more this year because I've just got a job,  said 24-year-old Dwi Kurnia Putri, before entering the shop at the Gandaria City Mall, in the south of the capital.   In the future, it looks like everything will turn out better ... but it will depend on how well I manage my money,  joked Putri, who now works for an electricity company. The central bank will hope that her optimism is infectious, as policymakers think consumer spending could lift economic growth closer to 5.3 percent this year, having dawdled at 5 percent or below in recent years.  We are confident ... the next leg of economic growth will come from consumption,   Dody Budi Waluyo, head of the economic and monetary policy department at Bank Indonesia, told Reuters. Looking Up There are several signs that the outlook is brightening for  Asia's third largest consumer market and the world's largest Muslim population. A survey by Bank Indonesia showed consumer confidence in May was at its highest since 2000.  Prices for commodities vital to the Indonesian economy, have stabilized, as has the rupiah currency IDR=.  Loan growth IDLONY=ECI has topped 9 percent, and unemployment has fallen steadily. Export growth IDEXG=ECI is expected to surpass 15 percent in May, boding well for the large workforce employed by that sector.  Central bank surveys also show companies have begun hiring more, and increasing their marketing budgets, while a sovereign credit rating upgrade awarded by Standard & Poor's last month has encouraged firms to raise more debt. The political mood in the capital, which accounts for a fifth of the archipelago nation's economy, has also recovered, after a religiously-charged election campaign for the Jakarta governorship that saw a hardline Islamist movement lead mass protests against an incumbent Christian governor who went on to lose the vote.  The feel-good factor is evident in places far beyond the capital as well, with the BI survey showing the outlook among consumers has improved particularly in commodity-reliant regions such as Sumatra and Sulawesi, probably reflecting a recovery in prices for palm oil and coal. A customer holds a shirt during late night Ramadan shopping at Gandaria City Mall in Jakarta, Indonesia, June 10, 2017.Beawiharta The commodity crisis is kind of done ... and the economy  is showing a smart recovery, so I would expect that the growth rate in consumption to rise in the second half,  said Ali Potia, international consulting firm McKinsey's Singapore-based leader for consumer practices in Southeast Asia.  The expectation in the retail sector is that this (Ramadan) is going to be busier than they've seen in a very long time.  Buying new clothes during Ramadan, and eating out to break fast with friends and family are part of Indonesian culture. Workers in the big cities look forward to returning to their kampungs, or villages, laden with bags full of gifts for the family. If they go home with few presents for the Eid festival at the end of the fasting month, it would be a sign of hard times.  Slideshow (6 Images)Vat Revenues Improving Jakarta's malls organize their sales on different weekends from each other, recognizing that the city's notoriously awful traffic makes it difficult for shoppers to get around. And, Stefanus Ridwan, the president director of PT Pakuwon Jati Tbk, a property company that operates Gandaria City mall, said the results of last Saturday's midnight sale were  good  and the shopping center was  more crowded , compared to last year.  Private consumption growth on a year-on-year basis has been 5 percent or less for every quarter during the past two years, lagging economic growth, and was only 4.9 percent in the first quarter of this year.  But, motorbike sales in May were up 15 percent, the highest growth since 2014, while April car sales showed growth running at 6 percent.  Certainly, revenues from value-added tax have improved, Suahasil Nazara, head of the finance ministry's fiscal policy office, told Reuters.    The other day I talked to retailers ... and they feel that they started to sense the pick up began in May,  he said.  Without getting carried away, retailers reckon a recovery has begun.  Fetty Kwartati, corporate secretary of PT Mitra Adiperkasa (MAPI.JK), which oversees brands such as Zara and Starbucks,  expects the company to show 13 percent sales growth this year, but she is  cautious  about the outlook.  The worst is over,  Kwartati said.

The actions came as part of the Trump administration's push to increase immigration enforcement and make countries, which have resisted in the past, take back nationals ordered deported from the United States. The crackdown on Iraqi immigrants followed the U.S. government's decision to drop Iraq from a list of Muslim-majority nations targeted by a revised version of Trump's temporary travel ban issued in March. The overwhelming majority of those arrested had criminal convictions for crimes including murder, rape, assault, kidnapping, burglary, drug trafficking, weapons violations and other offenses, Christensen said.

Since the March 12 agreement with Iraq regarding deportees, eight Iraqi nationals have been removed to Iraq. Dozens of Iraqi Chaldean Catholics in Detroit were among those targeted in the immigration sweeps, some of whom fear they will be killed if deported to their home country, immigration attorneys and family members said.

At least some of those arrested came to the United States as children, got in trouble and already served their sentences, according to immigration attorneys and activists. Some have lived in the United States so long they no longer speak Arabic. An Iraqi official previously said Iraqi diplomatic and consular missions would coordinate with U.S. authorities to issue travel documents for the deportees.

The vote on the bill, which has divided the public, followed opposition party delaying tactics, protests and concerns raised by a United Nations expert - who called the legislation  defective  - and came days before the current session of parliament was set to end on June 18.  Japanese governments had tried three times previously to pass similar legislation, which officials say is needed to ratify a U.N. treaty aimed at global organized crime as well as to prevent terrorism as Tokyo prepares to host the 2020 Olympics.  It's only three years until the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics and so I'd like to ratify the treaty on organized crime as soon as possible so we can firmly cooperate with international society to prevent terrorism,  Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told reporters.  That's why the law was enacted.   The legislation would criminalize plotting and preparing to commit 277  serious crimes  that critics such as the Japan Federation of Bar Associations note include acts with no obvious connection to terrorism or organized crime, such as sit-ins to protest construction of apartment buildings or copying music. Opponents see the legislation as part of Abe's broader to increase state powers and fear ordinary citizens could be targeted, despite government assurances to the contrary. Opposition Democratic Party leader Renho, who goes by one name, in a statement blasted the ruling party tactics and termed the law  brutal  legislation that violated freedom of thought. A monk holds a placard with a slogan against a bill targeting conspiracies to commit terrorism and other serious crimes, in front of Shibuya station in Tokyo, Japan June 9, 2017.Kim Kyung-HoonCombined with a widening of legal wiretapping and the reluctance of courts to limit police surveillance powers, the changes could deter grassroots opposition to government policies, critics say. To try to speed up passage of the law, the ruling bloc took the rare, contentious step of skipping a vote in an upper house committee and moving directly to a vote in the full upper house.  FILE PHOTO - Protesters shout slogans as they protest against an anti-conspiracy bill outside parliament building in Tokyo, Japan May 23, 2017.Issei Kato/File PhotoThe U.N. special rapporteur on the right to privacy, Joseph Cannataci, wrote to Abe last month asking him to address the risk that the changes could  lead to undue restrictions to the rights to privacy and to freedom of expression . In an email to Reuters, Cannataci said the Japanese government had used  the psychology of fear  to push through  defective legislation .  Japan needs to improve its safeguards for privacy, now even more so that this suspicious piece of legislation has been put on the statute books,  he said in the email. Critics say gathering information on possible plots would require expanded police surveillance, and the legislation has been compared to Japan's  thought police , who before and during World War Two had broad powers to investigate political groups seen as a threat to public order. A Kyodo news agency survey last month showed voters are split over the bill, with support at 39.9 percent and opposition at 41.4 percent.

Bank Mantap's proposed bond issuance will be IDR2 trillion in total with maturity of up to 60 months, which consists of: - Tranche A with issuance amount of IDR1.5 trillion and maturity of 36 months from the issuance date, - Tranche B with issuance amount of IDR500 billion and maturity of 60 months from the issuance date. Proceeds from the issuance will be used to support the company's working capital requirements. 'AA' National Rating denotes expectations of very low default risk relative to other issuers or obligations in the same country. The default risk inherently differs slightly from that of the country's highest rated issuers or obligations. KEY RATING DRIVERS The bonds are rated at the same level as Bank Mantap's National Long-Term Rating in line with Fitch criteria. Bank Mantap's national rating reflects Fitch's expectation of a high probability of extraordinary support from its majority shareholder, PT Bank Mandiri (Persero) Tbk (Mandiri, BBB-/AAA(idn)/Stable), if needed. Fitch views Bank Mantap as a strategically important subsidiary that has a key role in expanding Mandiri's pension lending business in Indonesia. Bank Mantap's focus on pension lending complements its parent's micro-lending business. RATING SENSITIVITIES Any changes in Bank Mantap's National Rating would affect the issue rating. The National Rating of Bank Mantap is sensitive to changes in its parent's rating. Any significant dilution in Mandiri's ownership or perceived weakening of support from Mandiri would exert downward pressure on Bank Mantap's rating. However, Fitch sees this prospect as remote in the foreseeable future, given its strategic role in expanding its parent's pension lending business in Indonesia. A material increase in ownership by Mandiri, a significantly greater contribution from Bank Mantap to its parent's consolidated business or other evidence of the bank's increased strategic importance to its parent could narrow the rating differential between the two entities.

In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitchâs factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors.

The Paris-based OECD, a rich-country think tank, also backed the Reserve Bank New of Zealand's proposal to add debt-to-income limits on home loans to its policy toolkit amid concerns over high household borrowing and rising house prices. OECD Chief Economist Catherine Mann said New Zealand's robust economic growth was  enviable , but stressed the need to tackle labour productivity that lagged its OECD peers.  Improving productivity growth is a major long-term challenge for improving inclusiveness and living standards,  Mann said in a report. The OECD is projecting slightly weaker growth than the New Zealand government, allowing for differences in the forecast periods. The OECD saw growth at 3.1 percent for both 2017 and 2018 calendar years, while the New Zealand government has forecast growth of 3.7 percent for 2017/18 and 3.5 percent for 2018/19. New Zealand's statistics agency said on Thursday the economy grew by 0.5 percent in the three months to March. The number was lower than the 0.7 percent growth forecast in a Reuters poll of economists and well under the central bank's forecast for 0.9 percent growth. The OECD said the New Zealand government should reduce barriers to foreign investment, lower the corporate tax rate and introduce research and development tax credits to tackle low productivity. Mann told reporters at a briefing in Wellington that debt-to-income limits on home loans would need to be deployed carefully, but could help ease pressures in New Zealand's strong housing market that pose systemic risks.  House price-to-income ratios being at this highly elevated level warrant some concern,  she said. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) said earlier this month said there would be  significant net benefits  in adopting DTI limits. It is seeking feedback on DTI limits by Aug. 18. New Zealand's housing market has soared more than 50 percent in value over the last decade, raising concerns that high mortgage debt could pose a systemic risk in the event of a sharp downturn in property prices. The RBNZ already requires investors to make a 40 percent downpayment on investment properties, after ramping up loan-to-value restrictions (LVR) in 2016. The measures have helped slow the rate of house price growth in recent months, but the central bank has said any resurgence in prices could be a worry. New Zealand's national household debt-to-income ratio stands at 168 percent, above most other OECD member countries, the IMF said in a report last month.

The Steel City is no stranger to championship parades, as Wednesday's festivities accounted for the fifth such sports-related event in Pittsburgh in the past dozen years. The NFL's Steelers celebrated Super Bowl victories for the 2005 and 2008 seasons while the Penguins have won titles in 2009, 2016 and 2017.

And the same thing this year.  This is something you're never going to forget.  The City of Pittsburgh estimated 400,000 fans attended last year's championship parade.  This team's been through a lot, and you guys (the fans) have been there every step of the way,  Coach Mike Sullivan said.  I said a little something last year and saying if we could do this again ...

Late on Tuesday, the acquisitive Chinese outfit said its Chairman Wu Xiaohui was temporarily unable to fulfil his duties for personal reasons. The New York Times and Chinaâs Caijing magazine, both citing sources, said he had been detained. Decoding what is happening where mainland business meets politics is never straightforward. Still, one way to read this is as a further sign that Beijing is fed up with splashy foreign dealmaking. A number of factors could be at play. First, regulators are cracking down on domestic insurers following a period of fast growth fuelled by high-yielding investment products. Last month an Anbang unit was temporarily blocked from issuing new ones. Some insurers have also dabbled in corporate raiding, further angering authorities.  Second, China is gearing up for its party congress later in the year, a twice-a-decade reshuffle where President Xi Jinping will seek to consolidate control. That may have set off a factional squabble. Anbang has elite connections, to former paramount leader Deng Xiaopingâs family and Communist Party scion Chen Xiaolu among others. It is not obvious if these links are assets or liabilities at present. Wu may have also misfired by getting into a public fight with Caixin, an influential business magazine, over exactly who owns Anbang.  Third, last yearâs record $220 billion of announced foreign deals prompted China to look harder at outbound mergers and acquisitions, especially big or strange ones. It doesnât want companies frittering money away on trophy assets, disguising capital flight, or embarrassing the nation. Here, Anbang could hardly have a higher profile â for example, holding abortive talks with Kushner Cos, the real estate firm previously led by President Donald Trumpâs son-in-law, about redeveloping a flagship New York tower. It is telling that Anbangâs compatriot HNA, which has been even busier recently, earlier this month vowed to slow down its pace of new deals. For Wu, this could still prove a blip. Fosun Chairman Guo Guangchang is still in charge after briefly assisting authorities in late 2015. And China Incâs impetus to do foreign deals will not go away entirely. But this episode seems likely to encourage further caution from Chinaâs tycoons. BreakingviewsReuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

The election of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) three years ago has emboldened right-wing Hindu groups to push harder for protection of the cow, an animal they consider sacred. Authorities in India's most populous state, Uttar Pradesh, started closing down unlicensed abattoirs in March, immediately hitting production and sales in the Muslim-dominated meat industry. Last month Modi's government also banned trading cattle for slaughter, including not just cows, whose killing was already outlawed in most states, but also buffalo, an animal used for meat and leather. Now the squeeze is spreading to others in the Muslim minority and to lower-caste Hindus who cart cattle, labor in tanneries and make shoes, bags and belts - including for big name brands such as Zara and Clarks. Frequent attacks by right-wing Hindus against workers they accuse of harming cattle have further rattled the industry. Social Tensions Much of India's meat and leather trade takes place in the informal economy, meaning the impact of the closing of illegal abattoirs and ban on trading for slaughter is hard to measure. But cattle markets are reporting a big slowdown in trade and tanneries a shortage of hides. Abdul Faheem Qureshi, a representative of India's Muslim Qureshi community of butchers, said in Uttar Pradesh some markets trading 1,000 animals last year were now down to as few as 100. The decline in production means fewer jobs for two of India's poorest communities, and risks inflaming social tensions at a time when Modi has vowed to boost employment and accelerate economic growth ahead of the next general election in 2019. Some large leather manufacturers support the Uttar Pradesh state government's move, arguing that allowing only licensed abattoirs to operate will clean the industry's image. Bigger exporters also say they have enough leather as they source hides widely, including from abroad. Still, millions work in the meat and leather industries, which are worth more than $16 billion in annual sales. When Reuters visited the narrow shoemaking lanes of Agra a crowd of Muslims breaking their Ramadan fast gathered, shouting angrily that they were no longer safe to trade buffalo, buy cow leather for shoes or to do work that their community has done for centuries for fear of being attacked by Hindu vigilantes.  They want to weaken us. They want to snatch our bread,  says 66-year-old Mohammad Muqeem, whose workers stitch $3 shoes in his cellar, referring to the closure of slaughterhouses and recent attacks on cattle traders. Muqeem's monthly income has halved to $300 since last year as leather has become scarce. His dozen casual workers, down from 40, now use mostly synthetic materials.      Impossible Target Like meat, India's leather industry has expanded rapidly in the last decade, providing relatively well-paid factory work and cash for families stitching informally in their homes. Agra, in Uttar Pradesh, turns out a million pairs of shoes a day for domestic buyers and European labels such as Inditex-owned Zara and Clarks. An estimated 40 percent of the population of the northern Indian city, famed as the home of the Taj Mahal, depends on the industry. Clarks said in a statement that it does not use leather from Indian-origin cows and that the small amount of buffalo leather it sources from India had not been impacted. Zara and did not respond to requests for comment. India is one of the world's top five producers of leather, with skins coming from cows that die of natural causes or from the legal slaughter of buffalo. Modi's government is targeting leather revenues of $27 billion - more than double today's level - by 2020 as part of a job creation push. Shoe-makers work in an underground workshop in Agra, India, June 9, 2017. Picture taken June 9, 2017.Cathal McNaughtonBut in May, the government decreed that animal markets could only trade cow and buffalo for agricultural purposes such as ploughing and dairy production - a move many in the industry say contradicts its plans to grow leather sales. India's environment minister said this week the government could amend the rule after a court temporarily stayed the order and there was widespread anger in regions where meat and leather are important to the local culture and economy. But industry officials said the shock of the ban, coming on the heels of the crackdown on abattoirs and attacks against cattle workers, meant business would not easily recover.  Companies say the government's leather target would be impossible to meet unless the restrictions are reversed.  There is a lot of panic in the industry after the latest order, which has come as the biggest blow,  Puran Dawar, chairman of Agra-based exporter Dawar Footwear Industries, said as hundreds of workers moulded shoes on the factory floor, referring to the ban on cattle traded for slaughter.  There are grave concerns about the supply of leather, exports of shoes and overall employment.  India's commerce ministry did not respond to requests for comment. In Uttar Pradesh, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, a controversial Hindu priest, had made closing unlicensed slaughter houses a priority after Modi appointed him in March. Slideshow (5 Images)About 30 percent of hides, mostly from buffaloes, that supply tanneries in the state are from unlicensed abattoirs. Sitting in his one-room shop in Agra's leather market, Mohammad Hashim, a burly leather dealer in his sixties, said business was down 40 percent in the last three months.  The recent scarcity of hides had hurt Hindus as much as Muslims, he said, pointing to the quiet streets outside and a Hindu man struggling to sell puffed rice snacks from his cart. Modi's election in 2014 and a resurgence in right-wing Hindu activism have increased concerns among Muslims that their livelihoods are under attack. As a minority making up 14 percent of India's 1.3 billion people, they are generally poorer and less literate than majority Hindus. When worshippers finishing evening prayers at the Mughal-era mosque in the shoemaking quarter of Agra are asked whether the chief minister handpicked by Modi is to blame, one of the Imams thunders:  Modi is to blame. He is targeting Muslims.  In an interview with Reuters, Chief Minister Adityanath rejected accusations the BJP had targeted any specific group.  Illegal slaughterhouses operated across the state and many big and small leather traders were buying raw material at cheapest rates from unlicensed slaughterhouses to maximize profits,  he said in Lucknow, the state capital. Wider Industry Hit In the industrial city of Kanpur, 250 km (155 miles) east of Agra, tanneries processing buffalo skins are reporting job losses as the availability of hides dries up. Nayyar Jamal, general secretary of Kanpur's Small Tanners' Association, reckons as many as 400,000 employees in Kanpur's leather and related industries are temporarily jobless, including some laid off because of environmental curbs on tannery pollution. Supplies of local hides have dropped by 20 to 30 percent. Qureshi, from the butchers' organization, estimates that 3.5 million employees in Uttar Pradesh alone have been directly hit.  More than the economic loss, the government has injected fear,  said ChandraÂ BhanÂ Prasad, a writer and businessman from the Dalit community, as those at the bottom of Hinduism's social hierarchy once called  untouchables  are known. Dalits and Muslims often work in trades that higher-caste Hindus traditionally consider beneath them. Tannery owner Mohammad Ikram said he was only able to procure 4,000 hides a month - down from 25,000 - because even truckers transporting legally obtained cow or buffalo hides fear attacks from vigilantes. He has a month's inventory left, and when that runs out he will have to start shedding staff. Shahnawaz Qureshi, a wage laborers stuffing synthetic shoes into plastic bags in Muqeem's cellar in Agra, lost his last job after his employer could no longer afford leather. He now earns 3,000 rupees  - or $47 - a month, down from 4,500 in his previous job, and together with his father's income supports three sisters and his mother.  I decided to sign up for this job despite the fact that I earn reasonably less here,  he said.

Complaints rose to 1,909 in April, the U.S. Department of Transportation reported, as consumer anger at airlines boiled over following video showing David Dao being violently removed from a United flight on April 9 to make room for crew members. This and other airline incidents caught on mobile phone videos have been widely broadcast on social media, prompting congressional hearings with airline executives that raised questions about customer service and airline cost-cutting. Congress may take up the issue of airplane passenger rights when it considers a bill to reauthorize the Federal Aviation Administration.  If airlines donât get their act together, we are going to act, it is going to be one size fits all,â said Bill Shuster, chairman of the House of Representativesâ transportation committee at a hearing in May.  Seize this opportunity because if you donât, weâre going to come, and youâre not going to like it.  Southwest Airlines Co said in April it would end overbooking, while United announced policy changes, including boosting compensation for overbooked passengers to up to $10,000. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao told Congress last week that the department had created a website to highlight passenger protections but she had not endorsed any new legal protections for airline passengers. Chao said it was in airlines'  best interest to treat passengers with respect.  The Transportation Department also said Wednesday in a statement that carriers canceled 1.6 percent of scheduled domestic flights in April, up from 0.9 percent in the same month last year. American Airlines Group Inc said Tuesday it would reduce leg room by one inch instead of two as originally planned on some seats in its Boeing 737 MAX jets, acknowledging customer concerns. In May, American said it would shrink the distance between some seat backs, or pitch, on its new Boeing Co 737 MAX jets from the minimum of 31 inches on its current 737-800 fleet, to 29 inches. The company said  airline customers feel increasingly frustrated by their experiences and less valued when they fly. We can be leaders in helping to turn around that perception.

(Reuters) - The jurors deciding comedian Bill Cosby's fate at his sexual assault trial delved into his accuser's account on Wednesday, their third day of deliberations, but failed to reach a verdict. The jury was dismissed for the night at about 9 p.m. (0100 GMT). The court reporter read back portions of Andrea Constand's testimony describing how Cosby drugged her and then sexually assaulted her at his Philadelphia-area home in 2004. Later in the day, the jury reviewed Cosby's six-hour 2005 police  interview in which he acknowledged giving Constand anti-allergy pills but characterized the encounter as consensual  petting.  Cosby, 79, has denied Constand's allegations, as well as dozens of similar accusations made by women stretching back decades. Only Constand's claims are recent enough to have led to criminal charges. The jury began deliberations in Norristown, Pennsylvania, on Monday and stayed late each night since then. They have now deliberated for a total of nearly 30 hours and will resume on Thursday morning. Cosby, the star of the 1980s hit TV series  The Cosby Show,  did not testify during the trial but his account of the night in question was shown to jurors in his sworn depositions in 2005 and 2006 during Constand's civil lawsuit as well as the 2005 police interview. As the deliberations continued on Wednesday, the crowd  outside the Montgomery County courthouse appeared to have grown. Accuser Lili Bernard smiles while speaking to media outside the Montgomery County Courthouse where Bill Cosby is waiting for deliberations to finish on the eighth day of his sexual assault trial in Norristown, Pennsylvania, U.S., June 14, 2017.Lucas Jackson A lot of people looked up to him. I did when I was a kid,  said Roland Jennings, 66, who drove about 20 miles (32 km) from West Chester to wait for the verdict.  He brought this on himself.  It was unclear how close the jury was to reaching a decision. Since starting deliberations, the jurors have re-examined both Cosby's and Constand's versions of the encounter, with particular focus on the pills he gave her beforehand. Slideshow (10 Images)Constand testified that the pills, which Cosby did not identify at the time, left her disoriented and unable to resist. The comedian said in depositions that he gave her the common allergy drug Benadryl and insisted she was a willing participant in the  petting  that followed. Cosby's lawyers have argued that Constand was his lover before she fabricated the assault to try to get money from him. They pointed to Constand's initial statement to police in 2005 that she had never been alone with him beforehand and cut off all contact afterward - both untrue. Constand testified she was mistaken, and prosecutors called a psychologist who said victims of sexual violence sometimes have trouble remembering details and engage in seemingly irrational behavior. Prosecutors have portrayed Cosby as a repeat offender with a familiar pattern of abuse. They called a second woman, Kelly Johnson, who testified that he drugged and sexually assaulted her in 1996. They also showed jurors testimony from his deposition in which he admitted giving young women sedatives in the 1970s.

The shooter, identified as James Hodgkinson of Illinois, was also taken to a hospital where he died from gunshot wounds. The following is information about the victims and their medical status after the shootings in Alexandria, Virginia, near Washington: - Majority Whip Steve Scalise, the No. 3 Republican in the House, was shot in the hip and was receiving care at MedStar Washington Hospital Center, his office said. Scalise was out of surgery but remained in critical condition, according to the hospital. As whip, Scalise, 51, from Louisiana, is responsible for rounding up votes for legislation and maintaining order among his party's fractious ranks. A year ago, Scalise and other Republican leaders blocked gun control legislation from coming to a vote on the House floor following a mass shooting at a nightclub in Orlando, Florida. - Matt Mika, a lobbyist for Arkansas-based Tyson Foods Inc and former staffer for two former Republican representatives, was shot in the chest, according to witnesses. In a statement, Mika's family said he was shot multiple times and was in critical condition. Mika served as a White House aide under former President George W. Bush, where he coordinated volunteers, worked with press advance and security details and managed VIP visits. - Zachary Barth, a staffer for U.S. Representative Roger Williams of Texas, was also shot. Williams said on Twitter that he was doing well and  expected to make a full recovery.  - Capitol Hill police officers David Bailey and Crystal Griner were also among the wounded. Both serve as part of Scalise's security detail and were in good condition, according to U.S. Capitol Police Chief Matthew Verderosa. The Federal Bureau of Investigation said only one of the police officers suffered a gunshot wound. Other people sustained minor injuries during the shooting but were not hit by gunfire.

(Reuters) - The jurors deciding comedian Bill Cosby's fate at his sexual assault trial delved into his accuser's account on Wednesday, their third day of deliberations, but failed to reach a verdict. The jury was dismissed for the night at about 9 p.m. (0100 GMT). The court reporter read back portions of Andrea Constand's testimony describing how Cosby drugged her and then sexually assaulted her at his Philadelphia-area home in 2004. Later in the day, the jury reviewed Cosby's six-hour 2005 police interview in which he acknowledged giving Constand anti-allergy pills but characterized the encounter as consensual  petting.  Cosby, 79, has denied Constand's allegations, as well as dozens of similar accusations made by women stretching back decades. Only Constand's claims are recent enough to have led to criminal charges. The jury began deliberations in Norristown, Pennsylvania, on Monday and stayed late each night since then. They have now deliberated for a total of nearly 30 hours and will resume on Thursday morning. Cosby, the star of the 1980s hit TV series  The Cosby Show,  did not testify during the trial but his account of the night in question was shown to jurors in his sworn depositions in 2005 and 2006 during Constand's civil lawsuit as well as the 2005 police interview. As the deliberations continued on Wednesday, the crowd outside the Montgomery County courthouse appeared to have grown.  A lot of people looked up to him. I did when I was a kid,  said Roland Jennings, 66, who drove about 20 miles (32 km) from West Chester to wait for the verdict.  He brought this on himself.  It was unclear how close the jury was to reaching a decision. Since starting deliberations, the jurors have re-examined both Cosby's and Constand's versions of the encounter, with particular focus on the pills he gave her beforehand. Constand testified that the pills, which Cosby did not identify at the time, left her disoriented and unable to resist. The comedian said in depositions that he gave her the common allergy drug Benadryl and insisted she was a willing participant in the  petting  that followed. Cosby's lawyers have argued that Constand was his lover before she fabricated the assault to try to get money from him. They pointed to Constand's initial statement to police in 2005 that she had never been alone with him beforehand and cut off all contact afterward - both untrue. Constand testified she was mistaken, and prosecutors called a psychologist who said victims of sexual violence sometimes have trouble remembering details and engage in seemingly irrational behavior. Prosecutors have portrayed Cosby as a repeat offender with a familiar pattern of abuse. They called a second woman, Kelly Johnson, who testified that he drugged and sexually assaulted her in 1996. They also showed jurors testimony from his deposition in which he admitted giving young women sedatives in the 1970s.

A government review earlier this year led to a cut in the discount rate used to calculate the payments, to minus 0.75 percent from the 2.5 percent in place since 2001, a move which wiped millions off the profits of UK insurers.  The downward move in the rate means insurers need to pay out more in cash to claimants now to ensure that returns over their lifetime meet the awarded compensation, a hit to motor insurers' profitability. Admiral's pretax profit fell by 25 percent in 2016 after the car insurer took most of the hit from the rate change in last year's earnings, while Direct Line took a one-off hit to earnings. EY, which estimated the overall cost of the change in the so-called Ogden rate based on market announcements and its own calculations, said in a report released on Thursday that the change will cost British motor insurers and reinsurers 3.5 billion pounds ($4.5 billion) initially.  That includes about 2.4 billion pounds of losses that have been disclosed publicly to date, but does not include any margins insurers had already set aside for the Ogden rate change prior to the announcement. It also does not include the ongoing costs in 2017 and in future from accidents that will be settled at the new rate. Britain's motor insurance market reported significant underwriting losses in 2016, EY said. Net combined ratios for the sector - a measure of profitability in which a result above 100 percent indicates a loss - worsened to 109 percent last year from 100.5 percent in 2015.  EY sees further pressure on the ratio in 2017, with ongoing costs from the new Ogden rate and the need for insurers to rebuild reserve margins released to offset it. It expects the ratio to weaken by 3.1 percentage points compared to a year earlier, excluding the Ogden rate impact. Reform of whiplash injury claims, which insurers say have resulted in many fraudulent claims, and a review of Ogden methodology may bring some respite, EY said.   The general election result last week may have created additional uncertainty and insurers will be hoping that the Ogden consultation and reform of whiplash claims will remain priorities for the new Lord Chancellor and the government,  Tony Sault, UK general insurance market lead at EY, said.   The change in the Odgen rate along with high repair costs and a rise in insurance premium tax to 12 percent are also expected to push up already rising motor insurance rates by 9 percent in 2017 to an average of 503 pounds, EY said.

The International Energy Agency (IEA) projects non-OPEC output will increase by 1.5 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2018 (âOil Market Reportâ, IEA, June 2017). If that proves correct, non-OPEC suppliers will capture all the increase in demand next year, because the IEA predicts consumption will increase by only 1.4 million bpd. In effect, OPEC will be restricting its own output only to see rival producers step in to meet growing demand from refiners. OPEC will face the familiar dilemma of whether to defend oil prices by continuing to restrict output or defend market share by growing production again. OPEC and its non-OPEC allies are unlikely to remain impassive as U.S. shale producers and other non-OPEC countries not bound by the production agreement capture all the growth in market demand in 2018. If U.S. shale production continues to grow rapidly, OPEC will probably return to defending its market share in 2018, even if it means accepting lower oil prices. Switching Tack OPECâs strategy can best be described as a cycle alternating between prioritizing price protection and defending market share. Between 2012 and the middle of 2014, the organization's members complacently enjoyed high prices but ceded market share to the U.S. shale sector and other non-OPEC producers including deepwater projects. OPECâs share of the market shrank progressively from 43.5 percent in 2012 to 41.2 percent in 2014, the lowest since 2006, according to BP (âStatistical Review of World Energyâ, BP, 2017). If the shale boom had continued, with U.S. production growing at more than 1 million bpd per year, OPECâs share would have fallen even further in 2015 and 2016 (tmsnrt.rs/2srWKEf). So OPEC, under the leadership of Saudi Arabia, refused to cut production and allowed oil prices to fall to curb the shale boom and deepwater projects, which was the only rational strategy under the circumstances. Between mid-2014 and mid-2016, OPECâs strategy switched to protecting its market share and allowing oil prices to sink. OPECâs market defense strategy appears to have been successful, with its share of output climbing from 41.2 percent in 2014 to 42.7 percent in 2016. But the cost proved more painful than anticipated, with oil prices slumping from an average of $100 per barrel in 2014 to less than $45 in 2016. In the second half of 2016, OPEC switched tack again, and abandoned its market share strategy in favor of a return to price defense. Prices have risen but OPECâs share of production is set to decline once more in both 2017 and 2018, which could force another change of strategy. Shale Rebound The resurgence of U.S. shale is already complicating OPECâs efforts to draw down global stocks in 2017, as well as threatening its market share in 2018. The speed and scale at which U.S. shale production has bounced back from the slump in 2015/16 has confounded OPEC and all the other major forecasters. OPEC wrote in its latest oil market assessment that rebalancing is underway but at a slower pace because of the âshift in U.S. supply from an expected contraction to positive growth.â OPEC now predicts U.S. oil production will increase by 800,000 bpd in 2017, compared with a projected decline of 150,000 bpd at the time of its December forecast (âMonthly Oil Market Reportâ, OPEC, June 2017). The International Energy Agency is forecasting U.S. crude and condensates production to increase by 620,000 bpd in 2017, compared with a prediction that output would be flat in its November assessment. And the U.S. Energy Information Administration has raised its prediction for U.S. output growth in 2017 to 460,000 bpd from a predicted decline of 80,000 bpd in December. Stein and Shale At this point in the cycle, it may be time for OPEC and U.S. shale drillers to heed Stein's Law. âIf something cannot continue forever, it will stop,â wrote Herbert Stein, chief economist to U.S. President Richard Nixon. His law is arguably the most important insight in economics but it is amazing how frequently it is forgotten (âWhat I think: essays on economics, politics and lifeâ, Stein, 1998). U.S. oil producers have added more than 400 extra rigs since the end of May 2016 in response to higher oil prices. But the increase in U.S. production is now threatening to overwhelm the market, in a re-run of the situation in 2014 that led to the price collapse. The U.S. Energy Information Administration projects U.S. production will rise by a further 680,000 bpd in 2018. The International Energy Agency is predicting an even larger increase. Most forecasters are bullish about the outlook for oil demand growth in 2018. Even so, output from U.S. shale and other non-OPEC sources will essentially capture the entire gain. The implied erosion of OPECâs market share is unlikely to be sustainable, and following Steinâs Law, it will stop. The correction is likely to come from lower oil prices, which will have to fall low enough for long enough to bring the boom back under control. Benchmark U.S. crude prices have already declined by $9 per barrel or about 16 percent from their recent peak in the middle of February. Shale producers have continued to add rigs even as prices have fallen because most of their production for 2017 had already been hedged at higher price levels (tmsnrt.rs/2ssekIv). Shale firms have also benefited from plentiful funding from private equity investors with a relatively long-term view on the market. But most producers have only hedged a relatively low proportion of output for 2018 so far, and the patience of private equity investors will not last forever. Crude prices will need to remain relatively low until more of the hedges have expired, private equity funding has slowed and drilling moderates to a more sustainable pace. Many U.S. shale producers insist they can drill wells profitably at prices well below $50 per barrel and in some cases below $40. There may be an element of bravado in some of these claims which may exclude certain costs and apply only to the most productive wells in the most promising locations. In any case, the oil market is already testing the shale drillers' resolve.  Oil prices are likely to remain weak until there are signs that U.S. drilling and future production are shifting onto a more sustainable trajectory.

Kalanick, under fire for crass behavior and fostering a culture of sexism and rule-breaking, in early March announced he was searching for a COO to help run the ride-services company. But in the months since, Uber has suffered a string of controversies and embarrassing setbacks and the job has remained unfilled - part of a leadership vacuum that extends through the company and up to the board of directors. In a report released Tuesday, former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder and his law firm, Covington & Burling, recommended sweeping management changes at Uber in the wake of sexual harassment allegations and other scandals.  The report advocates for a COO who  will act as a full partner  and run  day-to-day operations.  It also calls on the board of directors to take steps to limit the CEO's responsibilities and provide  clear lines of demarcation between  the COO and the CEO.  The way the COO job is written in the recommendations makes it a really powerful and important job,  said Bradley Tusk, an Uber investor and adviser.  Executive recruiters and tech investors agreed that the job might look more appealing now than it did before Tuesday's report. Still, it remains unclear if the company can attract a top-notch leader while Kalanick retains both the CEO title and, along with two allies, voting control of the company.  Kalanick said on Tuesday he was stepping aside at Uber because he needed time to grieve his recently deceased mother and work on his leadership shortcomings, according to a staff email seen by Reuters. He also said his leave  may be shorter or longer than we might expect.  Such ambiguity will effect Uber's efforts to rebuild its executive ranks, startup experts say.  The lack of clarity around Travis' position hangs over everything,  said Bill Aulet, managing director of the entrepreneurship center at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  You're dealing with the most important thing, which is, who is your boss?  Vacancies at the Top In the meantime, 14 people who report to Kalanick are charged with running the company until the CEO returns or a COO is hired. The company also is without a chief financial officer, general counsel and a head of engineering, among other open positions.  We have a strong leadership team including veterans who helped make the business what it is today and new talent who are helping to drive the changes we're committed to making,  Uber said in a statement. Uber is struggling to recruit new employees and has many who are eager to leave. Ed Zschau, founder of Inductus Associates, an executive search firm for startups, said his firm has  people from Uber in the search process  for a new job, including senior-level employees.  If the board can be recomposed a bit and get the company back on track, who the COO is will be an important signal as to whether people will want to work there,  Zschau said. Concerns about a lack of leadership extend to the board of directors. Holder's recommendations, including prohibiting romantic relationships between bosses and their subordinates and drinking on the job, suggest the Uber board failed to ensure the company had even the most basic checks and balances, say experts.  The Holder report could have been written by a law student who took an introductory corporate governance course,  said Erik Gordon, a technology and entrepreneurship expert at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business.  The board shares responsibility for the wreck.  Uber retained Holder's firm in February after a female former employee publicly accused the company of brazen sexual harassment. A wake of scandals followed, including a criminal investigation of the company's use of technology to evade regulators, a lawsuit alleging stolen self-driving car technology and a string of allegations relating to a toxic culture. On Tuesday, David Bonderman, a founder of private equity firm TPG Capital, an Uber investor, resigned from the board after making a sexist comment about women talking too much at the Uber staff meeting convened to discuss the Holder report. The resignation leaves Uber's board with seven voting members and four vacant seats.  Unlike the boards of most big companies, Uber's directors have little executive experience. In addition to Kalanick, the board includes co-founder and Chairman Garrett Camp, early employee Ryan Graves, venture capitalist Bill Gurley, Saudi investor Yasir al-Rumayyan and media impresaria Arianna Huffington. Wan Ling Martello, an executive vice president at Nestle, was added to the board this week as an independent director. The Holder recommendations call for a restructured board, but the recommendation to install an independent board chair  was left up to the board only to consider.

China on Wednesday approved two new varieties of genetically modified (GMO) crops for import from June 12, including Dow's Enlist corn, engineered to combat weeds resistant to the widely used herbicide glyphosate, which is the main ingredient in Monsanto's popular Roundup herbicide. China, the top export market for U.S. agricultural products, had pledged in May to speed up a review of biotech products as part of a trade deal with the United States, expediting eight products that have been pending for more than four years. Along with Enlist corn, Monsanto's Vistive Gold soybeans were also approved for import, the Ministry of Agriculture said in a statement.  We're very pleased to see the progress that's being made, that's been catalyzed by the discussions between the U.S. government and the Chinese government,  said Joe Vertin, global leader for Dow's Enlist Weed Control System. The Enlist platform is Dow AgroScience's largest-ever product launch and key to reaching its forecast for boosting seed sales by $600 million by 2020. Dow's Enlist soybeans are still being reviewed by officials in China and the European Union. The approvals of new GMO imports follow an agreement on protocols for shipments of U.S. beef to China that was also promised under the broader trade deal last month. China does not permit the planting of genetically modified food crops but does allow GMO imports, such as soybeans, for use in its animal feed industry.  Getting a new GMO crop variety approved for import by China takes around six years, compared with under three in other major markets, forcing leading agrichemical players to restrict sales during China's review process.  We are aware of the latest updates of the approval process and are encouraged by the fast progress that the Chinese government has made,  said a spokeswoman for DuPont Pioneer, which is awaiting approval for an insect-tolerant corn.  We look forward to more products getting approval.  The agriculture ministry said it had also renewed import approvals for 14 other GMO varieties including Syngenta's MIR162 Agrisure Viptera corn, a Monsanto sugar beet and three Bayer rapeseed products.  The approvals were for a three-year period lasting to 2020, the statement said. Shares of Dow fell 1.1 percent and Monsanto was barely changed at midday.

They chose the Bolt because it is the first mass-market electric vehicle with a range of over 200 miles. It also  has a price tag and range similar to the upcoming Tesla Model 3, which is Tesla's long-awaited entry into the mass market.  ( UBS Evidence Lab Electric Car Teardown - Disruption Ahead? , May 18, 2017).  Their surprise finding is that the Bolt's powertrain was $4,600 cheaper to produce than they expected  with more cost reduction potential left.  Their key takeaway is that the Bolt could reach consumer cost of ownership parity with a comparable internal combustion engine vehicle such as the Volkswagen Golf much sooner than expected, as early as next year in Europe.  That would represent a tipping point for demand and UBS has lifted its electric vehicle (EV) sales projections by around 50 percent accordingly.   We now forecast 3.1m EVs sold in 2021 (battery-electric cars and plug-in hybrids) and 14.2m sold in 2025, instead of 2.5m and 9.7m previously.  Electric vehicles' share of new sales is forecast to rise from that marginal 0.2 percent last year to three percent in 2021 and 14 percent in 2025.  Double Revolution And if those numbers look a bit on the aggressive side, UBS' forecasts look decidedly pedestrian relative to those of RethinkX, a thinktank founded by Stanford University's Tony Seba.   Rethinking Transportation 2020-2030 , also released last month, generated a flurry of headlines about the imminent demise of the combustion engine.   We are on the cusp of one of the fastest, deepest, most consequential disruptions of transportation in history,  the report warns. One which  will have enormous implications across the transportation and oil industries, decimating entire portions of their value chains, causing oil demand and prices to plummet, and destroying trillions of dollars in investor value.  Phew! RethinkX' core argument is that there is not one but two technical revolutions under way in the automotive sector.  Electrification of the global car fleet will coincide with the roll-out of autonomous vehicle technology with both trends feeding off each other.   By 2030, within 10 years of regulatory approval of autonomous vehicles (AVs), 95 percent of U.S. passenger miles traveled will be served by on-demand autonomous electric vehicles owned by fleets, not individuals, in a new business model we call 'transport-as-a-service' . Consumer Choice or Government Mandate? It's an extreme vision but one that serves to underline the diversity of views as to what to expect over the coming decade.  In truth, there is no consensus whatsoever as to how fast electrification, or indeed automation, of the global vehicle fleet will happen.  There are simply too many moving parts to the equation, far more than the 24 the UBS team found in the Bolt's powertrain.  UBS' research aims to tackle the problem from a consumer choice model. When does the cost and convenience of owning an electric vehicle outweigh the advantages still enjoyed by existing internal combustion engine vehicles?  But in many parts of the world, consumer choice will be directly affected by government edict.  California led the way with its 2012 mandate that automakers selling more than 600,000 vehicles a year in the state must sell a stipulated amount of zero-emission-vehicles or risk losing the right to sell any at all.  China, which has its own problems with smog, is now picking up the compliance baton. Its proposed system, currently at the draft legislation stage, is much tougher. Nor has Beijing shown any signs of giving in to automaker pressure to push the start back from 2018. [nL3N1JA3H7] There are multiple similar national and city initiatives.  London, for example, has stipulated that all new black cabs will have to be partly electric-powered by January next year.  Electrification of the 24,000-strong taxi fleet will go hand in hand with higher charges on diesel cars entering the city later this year.  So fast are these changes happening that the city's local and transport authorities are now racing against the clock to install the charging infrastructure necessary to support an all-electric cab fleet.  It's the interaction of consumer choice and government coercion that makes projecting EV growth rates so difficult.  Volatility Ahead Metals such as cobalt and lithium find themselves on the front-line of this green transport revolution because of their core role in batteries.  Explosive price hikes last year in lithium and earlier this year in cobalt were prime examples of what happens when supply chains are too slow to react to new demand drivers.  The initial lithium price shock seems to be fading as existing producers ramp up capacity and new operators enter the marketplace.  Cobalt, as traded on the London Metal Exchange, rocketed from $32,750 per tonne at the start of January to $56,250 in early April and has since also shown signs of flattening out at a current $56,500. In both cases the initial price shock has passed.  But there is the potential for more price volatility going forward because producers, traders and analysts alike are struggling to construct consensus demand models.  That's the problem with revolutions. Once they start they evolve in wholly unpredictable ways.  The great technological jump of vehicle electrification is going to lead to some equally big moves in price.  Up? Down?  Probably both.

The International Energy Agency (IEA) projects non-OPEC output will increase by 1.5 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2018 (âOil Market Reportâ, IEA, June 2017). If that proves correct, non-OPEC suppliers will capture all the increase in demand next year, because the IEA predicts consumption will increase by only 1.4 million bpd. In effect, OPEC will be restricting its own output only to see rival producers step in to meet growing demand from refiners. OPEC will face the familiar dilemma of whether to defend oil prices by continuing to restrict output or defend market share by growing production again. OPEC and its non-OPEC allies are unlikely to remain impassive as U.S. shale producers and other non-OPEC countries not bound by the production agreement capture all the growth in market demand in 2018. If U.S. shale production continues to grow rapidly, OPEC will probably return to defending its market share in 2018, even if it means accepting lower oil prices. Switching Tack OPECâs strategy can best be described as a cycle alternating between prioritizing price protection and defending market share. Between 2012 and the middle of 2014, the organization's members complacently enjoyed high prices but ceded market share to the U.S. shale sector and other non-OPEC producers including deepwater projects. OPECâs share of the market shrank progressively from 43.5 percent in 2012 to 41.2 percent in 2014, the lowest since 2006, according to BP (âStatistical Review of World Energyâ, BP, 2017). If the shale boom had continued, with U.S. production growing at more than 1 million bpd per year, OPECâs share would have fallen even further in 2015 and 2016 (tmsnrt.rs/2srWKEf). So OPEC, under the leadership of Saudi Arabia, refused to cut production and allowed oil prices to fall to curb the shale boom and deepwater projects, which was the only rational strategy under the circumstances. Between mid-2014 and mid-2016, OPECâs strategy switched to protecting its market share and allowing oil prices to sink. OPECâs market defense strategy appears to have been successful, with its share of output climbing from 41.2 percent in 2014 to 42.7 percent in 2016. But the cost proved more painful than anticipated, with oil prices slumping from an average of $100 per barrel in 2014 to less than $45 in 2016. In the second half of 2016, OPEC switched tack again, and abandoned its market share strategy in favor of a return to price defense. Prices have risen but OPECâs share of production is set to decline once more in both 2017 and 2018, which could force another change of strategy. Shale Rebound The resurgence of U.S. shale is already complicating OPECâs efforts to draw down global stocks in 2017, as well as threatening its market share in 2018. The speed and scale at which U.S. shale production has bounced back from the slump in 2015/16 has confounded OPEC and all the other major forecasters. OPEC wrote in its latest oil market assessment that rebalancing is underway but at a slower pace because of the âshift in U.S. supply from an expected contraction to positive growth.â OPEC now predicts U.S. oil production will increase by 800,000 bpd in 2017, compared with a projected decline of 150,000 bpd at the time of its December forecast (âMonthly Oil Market Reportâ, OPEC, June 2017). The International Energy Agency is forecasting U.S. crude and condensates production to increase by 620,000 bpd in 2017, compared with a prediction that output would be flat in its November assessment. And the U.S. Energy Information Administration has raised its prediction for U.S. output growth in 2017 to 460,000 bpd from a predicted decline of 80,000 bpd in December. Stein and Shale At this point in the cycle, it may be time for OPEC and U.S. shale drillers to heed Stein's Law. âIf something cannot continue forever, it will stop,â wrote Herbert Stein, chief economist to U.S. President Richard Nixon. His law is arguably the most important insight in economics but it is amazing how frequently it is forgotten (âWhat I think: essays on economics, politics and lifeâ, Stein, 1998). U.S. oil producers have added more than 400 extra rigs since the end of May 2016 in response to higher oil prices. But the increase in U.S. production is now threatening to overwhelm the market, in a re-run of the situation in 2014 that led to the price collapse. The U.S. Energy Information Administration projects U.S. production will rise by a further 680,000 bpd in 2018. The International Energy Agency is predicting an even larger increase. Most forecasters are bullish about the outlook for oil demand growth in 2018. Even so, output from U.S. shale and other non-OPEC sources will essentially capture the entire gain. The implied erosion of OPECâs market share is unlikely to be sustainable, and following Steinâs Law, it will stop. The correction is likely to come from lower oil prices, which will have to fall low enough for long enough to bring the boom back under control. Benchmark U.S. crude prices have already declined by $9 per barrel or about 16 percent from their recent peak in the middle of February. Shale producers have continued to add rigs even as prices have fallen because most of their production for 2017 had already been hedged at higher price levels (tmsnrt.rs/2ssekIv). Shale firms have also benefited from plentiful funding from private equity investors with a relatively long-term view on the market. But most producers have only hedged a relatively low proportion of output for 2018 so far, and the patience of private equity investors will not last forever. Crude prices will need to remain relatively low until more of the hedges have expired, private equity funding has slowed and drilling moderates to a more sustainable pace. Many U.S. shale producers insist they can drill wells profitably at prices well below $50 per barrel and in some cases below $40. There may be an element of bravado in some of these claims which may exclude certain costs and apply only to the most productive wells in the most promising locations. In any case, the oil market is already testing the shale drillers' resolve.  Oil prices are likely to remain weak until there are signs that U.S. drilling and future production are shifting onto a more sustainable trajectory.

Brent crude futures were down 7 cents or 0.2 percent at $46.93 per barrel at 0053 GMT, after slumping nearly 4 percent in the previous session. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were down 12 cents or 0.3 percent at at $44.61 per barrel. Crude futures benchmarks are sitting near their lowest levels since late November last year when production cuts led by the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) were first announced. Brent and WTI are down over 12 percent since their opens on May 25, when the agreement to cut was extended to the end of the first quarter next year, instead of expiring this month as initially planned.  OPEC 2017 year-to-date exports are only down by 0.3 million barrels per day (bpd) from the October 2016 baseline,  analysts at AB Bernstein said in a note to clients. OPEC's pledge was to cut some 1.2 million bpd, while other producers including Russia would bring the total reduction to almost 1.8 million bpd. However, some OPEC members including Nigeria and Libya have been exempt from cutting, and their rising output undermines efforts led by Saudi Arabia. Meanwhile, production in the United States - which is not participating in the deal - has jumped by more than 10 percent over the past year to 9.33 million bpd. C-OUT-T-EIA  Production growth in Libya and Nigeria and continued rig additions in U.S. are complicating the picture, raising doubts on OPEC's strategy. For OECD inventories to return to the normalized levels, OPEC needs to drain by 34 million barrels a month or 1 million barrels for the next 10 months. This looks challenging,  AB Bernstein said. The International Energy Agency (IEA) said this week that oil supplies next year would still outpace demand despite consumption hitting 100 million bpd for the first time.

The singer-songwriter's remarks on how the book  Moby Dick  influenced him bear a close similarity to the SparkNotes summaries of the Herman Melville classic novel, according to an analysis on Slate.com. SparkNotes.com provides study guides for students in literature and other fields. Author Andrea Pitzer, writing on Slate.com on Tuesday, listed some 20 sentences from the portion of Dylan's lecture on  Moby Dick  that closely resembled phrases or ideas on the SparkNotes website on the book. They included lines from Dylan's online lecture such as  Ahab's got a wife and child back in Nantucket that he reminisces about now and then.  The entry from SparkNotes reads  musing on his wife and child back in Nantucket,  Pitzer noted. Dylan's representatives did not return calls for comment on Wednesday. Dylan, whose songs include  Blowin' in the Wind,   The Times They Are A-Changin  and  Like a Rolling Stone,  has admitted in the past that he draws from other influences. In a 2012 interview with Rolling Stone magazine, he brushed aside criticism that he plagiarized the work of other artists by saying:  It's called songwriting. It has to do with melody and rhythm, and then after that, anything goes. You make everything yours. We all do it.  The media-shy Dylan, 76, delivered his lecture to the Swedish Academy last week just within the six-month time limit set by the organization in order for Nobel laureates to receive the 8 million crowns ($900,000) that goes with the prize. He chose not to attend the annual ceremony and banquet in Stockholm.  If the Moby Dick portion of his Nobel lecture was indeed cribbed from SparkNotes, then what is the world to make of it? Perhaps the use of SparkNotes can be seen as a sendup of the prestige-prize economy,  said Pitzer.

Deepening political turmoil in Washington also weighed on the greenback, with the Washington Post reporting that U.S. President Donald Trump is being investigated by special counsel Robert Mueller for possible obstruction of justice. Also on Wednesday, a prominent Republican was among those shot by a gunman said to be angry with Trump. The dollar index, which tracks the U.S. currency against a basket of six rivals, was flat on the day at 96.932 but above its overnight low of 96.323 plumbed after downbeat economic figures. The Federal Reserve raised interest rates a quarter percentage point to a target range of 1.00 percent to 1.25 percent as expected overnight and gave its first clear outline on its plan to reduce its $4.2-trillion bond portfolio. But the moves were overshadowed by inflation and retail sales data earlier in the day that fell short of market expectations. The core rate of inflation increased at just 1.7 percent on year, the fourth straight monthly deceleration and the slowest overall pace in two years. The Fed said a recent softening in inflation was seen as transitory, but the latest tepid price readings made investors question its view that the U.S. economy is continuing to improve. Against its Japanese counterpart, the dollar shrugged off earlier losses and was flat at 109.55 yen, above Wednesday's eight-week low of 108.81 yen. The euro edged down slightly to $1.1214, below a seven-month peak of $1.1296 scaled overnight. U.S. 10-year yields were last at 2.134 percent, below their U.S. close of 2.138 percent on Thursday, when they fell as low as 2.103 percent, their lowest since Nov. 10. The Fed also mapped out a very gradual approach to shrink its $4.2-trillion holdings of Treasury- and mortgage-backed assets that would allow it to begin as early as September. The process could start  relatively soon,  Fed Chair Janet Yellen said.  There is a lot to digest, and even some apparently conflicting signals, such as the fact that the Fed revised its own inflation outlook slightly down and yet kept its intention to raise rates again this year,  said Mitsuo Imaizumi, Tokyo-based chief foreign-exchange strategist for Daiwa Securities. The Fed said it expects U.S. inflation to be at 1.7 percent by the end of this year, down from the 1.9 percent previously forecast.  It remains to be seen if the Fed can really do both this year - raise rates again, and also begin reducing its balance sheet,  he added. A Reuters poll of 21 of the 23 primary dealers that do business directly with the Fed showed 14 of them now believed it would announce the start of its balance sheet normalization at its Sept. 19-20 policy meeting. The rest of them said it would make such a move at its Dec. 12-13 meeting. They said they expected Fed policymakers to hike interest rates one more time by the end of 2017 and then three times in 2018.

New Zealand's economy grew 0.5 percent in the three months to March, lower than the 0.7 percent growth forecast in a Reuters poll of economists and well below the central bank's forecast for 0.9 percent growth.

South Korea's Iranian crude intake fell 18.7 percent in May from a year ago to 1.02 million tonnes, or 242,058 barrels per day (bpd), customs data showed on Thursday. That was the lowest since last October when Seoul imported 902,987 tonnes. Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries member Iran is exempt from an international drive to curb oil supply to boost prices, with the country pushing to regain market share lost during years of sanctions over its nuclear programme. But it has already used up the crude it had in floating storage and is now fighting to boost output to support export volumes. Iran's crude exports were set to fall to a 14-month low in May, a person with knowledge of Tehran's loading schedules said previously. South Korea, one of Iran's major Asian customers, brought in 8.12 million tonnes of crude, or 394,324 bpd, over the January-May period. That was up nearly 60 percent from 5.08 million tonnes at the same time last year. Meanwhile, South Korea's crude imports from Saudi Arabia rose in May even though the OPEC-led push to curb supply was last month extended until the end of next March. Saudi Arabia is the de facto leader of OPEC. South Korea imported 4.23 million tonnes of crude oil, or 999,680 bpd, from the world's top crude exporter in May, up 18.6 percent from 3.56 million tonnes in April. Overall, the world's fifth-biggest crude importer shipped in 12.37 million tonnes of oil, or 2.93 million bpd, the data showed. That was steady from 12.43 million tonnes a year ago. In the first five months of 2017, South Korea imported 60.62 million tonnes of crude, or 2.94 million bpd, up 1.5 percent from 59.73 million tonnes over the same period in 2016.

Suncor Energy Inc said late on Tuesday that Syncrude will not return to full rates until mid-July after maintenance scheduled to take place in the autumn of 2017 was added on to an ongoing turnaround. Syncrude is cutting 17.24 percent of its June production, from 5.8 million barrels to 4.8 million barrels, according to two sources with knowledge of the matter. The plant, which can produce up to 350,000 barrels per day (bpd) of synthetic crude at full capacity, is instead shipping 130,000 bpd to customers, Suncor said. Those volumes are expected to ramp up as maintenance on various units wraps up. Light synthetic crude from the oil sands for July delivery climbed to last trade at 75 cents per barrel over the West Texas Intermediate benchmark, according to Shorcan Energy brokers, having settled at 65 cents per barrel over WTI on Tuesday. Syncrude has been operating below capacity since March when a fire damaged the facility and forced Suncor to bring forward planned maintenance. The blaze started after a split in a carbon steel line in a naphtha hydrotreater, and most of the damage was to a piperack next to the hydrotreater containing piping, cables and electrical circuits. Suncor said there is no change to its overall 2017 production guidance as a result of the extended maintenance. The company's shares were last down 3.1 percent at C$39.61 on the Toronto Stock Exchange.  We view the update as being negative as the outage has once again shown to be larger than expected,  AltaCorp Capital analyst Nick Lupick wrote in a note to clients. The volume cuts have helped prop up the price of synthetic crude, and also tightened supply of heavy crude, because some oil sands producers need synthetic barrels from Syncrude to blend with their bitumen so it can flow through pipelines. Western Canada Select heavy blend crude for July delivery last traded at $10.45 per barrel below WTI, little changed from Tuesday's settle of $10.50 per barrel under the benchmark.

As its manufacturing engine sputters, the world's second largest economy is increasingly relying on infrastructure spending to boost growth, spurring demand for construction steel products and lifting producer profit margins to near record levels. Combined with recent cuts to low-quality steel capacity amid a war on pollution, this infrastructure drive looks set to brighten the outlook for construction-grade steelmakers just as their more sophisticated peers wrestle with sluggish demand from manufacturers and automakers.  Because of capacity cuts and expected stronger infrastructure spending by China, there's a strong upside for long products consumption which can boost rebar makers' profits in the years ahead,  said Richard Lu, analyst at CRU consultancy in Beijing. The profit margin on construction steel product rebar, also known as long steel, has surged more than 800 percent this year to around 1,100 yuan ($162) per tonne in early June, according to data tracked by brokerage CLSA.  The margin for cold rolled coil, or CRC - otherwise referred to as flat steel - used in cars and home appliances, has dropped 47 percent to around 437 yuan over the same period. Margins for high-end products like CRC have usually been higher than for rebar. Between 2012 and 2016, the average margin for CRC was 341 yuan per tonne compared to 107 yuan for rebar, CLSA data showed. That has spurred mills in the world's top steel producer to reopen once-shut rebar production lines to cash-in on soaring prices. The strong demand has also cut traders' inventories of rebar by more than half in less than four months.  Our boss saw good profit on rebar, so he decided to resume the lines which had been shut for two years,  said a sales manager at Rizhao Steel Holding Group, a midsize steel producer in China's eastern Shandong Province.  The lines are expected to keep operating as the outlook for construction steel is good.  'No Choice' Improving infrastructure is high on Chinese President Xi Jinping's agenda as he promotes his ambitious Belt and Road initiative - building road and rail connections with Central Asia and beyond. Meantime, manufacturing has struggled, with China's car sales falling for a second straight month in May for the first time since 2015, limiting demand for high-value flat products like CRC. The reversal of fortune between Chinese producers of cheap, low-grade construction steel and makers of high-value steel was also triggered by Beijing's crackdown on industrial pollution. As it battles smog, China has vowed to eliminate induction furnaces - a highly polluting type of plant that produces mostly rebar - by the end of this month.  FILE PHOTO: Stacks of rebar await delivery at Shanxi Zhongsheng Iron and Steel in Fenyang, Shanxi Province, China, April 28, 2016.John Ruwitch/File PhotoAnalysts estimate induction furnaces produced about 50 million tonnes of rebar last year - about a quarter of China's total rebar output.  So far this year, average margins for rebar were 572 yuan per tonne compared with 91 yuan in all of 2016, CLSA data showed.    The unexpected resurgence among producers of lower grade, cheaper steel is a setback for China's efforts to modernize its massive steel sector, mainly by pushing the big, sophisticated steelmakers to swallow smaller rivals and shut inefficient ones.  Last year, China's most technologically advanced steelmaker Baosteel acquired rival Wuhan Iron and Steel, creating the world's second-largest steelmaker behind ArcelorMittal. Some Chinese mills that produce both long and flat steel products are making more of the former because of the robust margins, said Daniel Meng, a Hong Kong-based analyst at CLSA.    It is quite a general phenomenon,  said Meng.  You should see such switching across many mills rather than just a small number of mills.  But some mills that make only flat steel products could not shut their plants.  Although flat producers realize the margin is narrowing, they have no choice but to continue producing since it would cost more money to stop the equipment and turn it on again when profit goes better,  said a manager of a unit of state-owned Shandong Iron and Steel Group.  At around 437 yuan a tonne in early June, the margin on flat steel CRC was less than half of where it was in late January, CLSA data showed. While Chinese traders' stockpiles of both rebar and CRC have fallen from this year's peaks, rebar inventory has dropped 56 percent while CRC stocks have fallen only 13 percent, data compiled by SteelHome consultancy showed.  Higher Exports? As domestic appetite slows, more flat steel products from China are being sold overseas. They totaled 14.85 million tonnes during January-April, or 55 percent of total steel exports. In 2016, flat steel shipments were 48.03 million tonnes and made up 44 percent of total exports. The increased proportion of high-end steel shipments this year could raise fresh concerns that China may be open to renewed accusations of steel dumping on international markets.   Chinese steelmakers  have previously been accused of selling material at below cost, in order to offload their excess supply,  said Jeremy Platt from UK steel consultancy MEPS.  Amid a weak domestic trading environment, Chinese suppliers could be encouraged, in the coming months, to increase their export volumes.

Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt cut diplomatic and transport ties with Qatar a week ago, accusing it of fomenting regional unrest, supporting terrorism and getting too close to Iran, all of which Doha denies. The International Civil Aviation Organization, a U.N. agency that regulates international air travel under the Chicago Convention, said it would host talks of ministers and senior officials from Qatar, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Egypt at its Montreal headquarters on Thursday to seek a  consensus-based solution  that addressed  current regional concerns.   ICAO is presently reviewing requests from the government of Qatar to assess the flight restrictions imposed upon it by neighbouring states,  according to an ICAO statement. Most of the officials attending the meeting are expected to be transport ministers, according to an ICAO representative. ICAO, which was created after the United States invited more than 50 allies to agree to a common air navigation system in 1944, has no policing powers and has to rely on consensus to enforce its will. ICAO's decision to intervene in the Gulf airspace dispute is a rare instance of the U.N. body directly attempting to settle a row between states.  We are working bring these states together towards a solution which satisfies both their current regional concerns and the global needs and expectations of passengers and shippers,  ICAO said. The United Arab Emirates and Qatar have long been major proponents of open-skies air transport agreements which remove restrictions on flying between states. These policies helped the region's largest airlines, Emirates, Etihad Airways and Qatar Airways, to develop their home airports as hubs linking passengers travelling between the east and west. The UAE's General Civil Aviation Authority said it was fully committed to the Chicago Convention but reserved the sovereign right under international law to take any precautionary measures to protect its national security if necessary, UAE state news agency WAM said. Saudi Arabia on Tuesday said the closure of its airspace to flights from Qatar was within the kingdom's sovereign right to protect its citizens from any threat.

They all count the same,  he insisted after he'd contributed the longest of his team's three home runs to a 7-2 win that completed a two-game sweep of the struggling Giants on Wednesday afternoon.  I'm happy when they get over the fence,  Moustakas said of his 18th home run, a solo shot against former teammate Johnny Cueto.  Regardless of how far they go.  Moustakas, Jorge Bonifacio and Lorenzo Cain each belted a home run in a 16-hit attack that backed the strong pitching of right-hander Jason Hammel. The victory was the Royals' third in four interleague meetings this season with the team that defeated them in the 2014 World Series.  I left those three pitches hanging and they beat me,  Cueto said afterward.  I just had a bad game.  In beating the Giants for first time in 13 career meetings, Hammel scattered eight hits in 6 2/3 innings. He walked one and struck out four, pitching Kansas City to its fourth straight win. Related CoveragePreview: Royals at GiantsKansas City Royals - PlayerWatchSan Francisco Giants - PlayerWatch Real nice. Hasn't happened much this year,  Hammel said of the offensive support.  Anytime you get runs to work with, you want to make them count.  Hammel (3-6) pitched with a lead after Moustakas crushed a Cueto pitch well over the right field wall leading off the second inning. The homer hit a railing along a walkway beyond the wall and one-hopped into the San Francisco Bay, thus preventing it from becoming what would have been the first  Splash Hit  in Royals' history. The homers by Bonifacio and Cain came back-to-back in the third inning. Bonifacio's ninth was a two-run shot that also plated Whit Merrifield, who had singled, and Cain followed two pitches later with his seventh of the season, increasing the Kansas City lead to 4-0. The back-to-back homers were the fifth of the season for the Royals and second of their five-game Western swing. Eric Hosmer and Salvador Perez hit consecutive homers Saturday in San Diego.  That's what we planned coming out of spring training,  Royals manager Ned Yost said of a deep offensive attack that featured two or more hits from six different players.  We knew if we stayed calm, didn't panic, we'd be all right. This is the offense we knew we had.  The Royals knocked out Cueto in the sixth with an RBI double by Bonifacio after another single by Merrifield. Cueto (5-6) gave up five runs and a season-high 10 hits in 5 2/3 innings. He walked three and struck out five.  This is humbling to go through something like this,  said Giants manager Bruce Bochy, whose team completed a 1-4 homestand.  It's a tough time for these fellows.  Alcides Escobar, Cain and Merrifield, who scored three times, finished with three hits apiece the Royals, who have totaled 38 runs in opening their nine-game trip with four wins in five outings. Kansas City opens a four-game series against the Los Angeles Angels on Thursday. Bonifacio recorded three RBIs, and Moustakas and Cain drove in two runs apiece for the Royals, who improved to 4-1 in interleague play this season. Denard Span, Eduardo Nunez and Joe Panik had two hits apiece for the Giants, who lost for the seventh time in their last eight home games and 11th time in their last 15 games overall. The Giants totaled 10 hits. NOTES: Royals 3B Mike Moustakas has hit safely in 12 of his last 13 games, going 19-for-50 (.380) over that stretch with five homers and 14 RBIs. ...

Canada's biggest non-bank lender said that it would make a payment of C$10 million ($7.6 million) and reimburse the commission's costs of C$500,000. Former directors will also pay fines totaling C$2 million taking the total payment to the OSC to C$12 million excluding costs.  In a linked settlement, Home Capital said that it would pay C$29.5 million to settle a class action lawsuit. That includes C$11 million from the fines imposed by the OSC, which the commission said should be paid to Home Capital investors who were part of the class action.  Home Capital said that it expected to fund the costs of the settlements substantially through its liability insurance.  Home Capital will accept full responsibility for failing to meet its disclosure obligations to the marketplace and appreciates the importance of the serious concerns raised by the Commission with respect to continuous and timely disclosure,  the company's Chair Brenda Eprile said in a statement. Depositors have withdrawn 95 percent of funds from Home Capital's high interest savings accounts since March 27, when the company terminated the employment of former Chief Executive Martin Reid. The withdrawals accelerated after April 19, when the OSC, Canada's biggest securities regulator, accused Home Capital of making misleading statements to investors about its mortgage underwriting business. Reuters reported on Wednesday that Home Capital was in talks with a syndicate of banks, including some of Canada's biggest lenders, to secure a loan of about C$2 billion ($1.5 billion) to replace a costly emergency credit line it agreed in April.  These settlements will enable us to move forward with regaining the confidence of our depositors and shareholders and creating value for all our stakeholders,  Eprile said.

The lawsuit, filed by civil rights attorneys in the U.S. District Court of Northern Illinois, came after Mayor Rahm Emanuel backed off a pledge to let a federal judge oversee reforms. The lawsuit asks the court to ensure reforms will halt what it described as the ongoing use of excessive force, physical harassment and targeting of minority youth and a reliance on overly aggressive tactics by Chicago police.  Chicago has proven time and time again that it is incapable of ending its own regime of terror, brutality and discriminatory policing,  the lawsuit said.  Absent federal court supervision, nothing will improve.  In January, a federal investigation found Chicago police routinely violated the civil rights of people, citing excessive force and racially discriminatory conduct. That followed protests sparked by the fall 2015 release of video showing a white police officer fatally shooting black teen Laquan McDonald a year earlier.  After the probe's findings were released, Emanuel committed to a consent decree, a court-ordered reform agreement. FILE PHOTO: Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson arrives at a news conference in Chicago, Illinois, U.S., on September 21, 2016.Jim Young/File PhotoEarlier this month, he said Chicago was discussing an agreement with the Justice Department that would include an independent monitor instead of court oversight. In an interview with Reuters, Emanuel said a consent decree with the Justice Department is not an option because Attorney General Jeff Sessions does not favor them to impose reform. Chicago has pushed ahead with reforms including enacting new rules on use of force, provided two-thirds of the Chicago police force with body cameras and is hiring 1,000 new officers, Emanuel said. FILE PHOTO: Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel speaks during the U.S.-China Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade Investment Luncheon Program in Chicago, Illinois, December 17, 2014.Andrew NellesEmanuel indicated he still has questions about the role of any outside monitor.  If you have an outside monitor, what are their authorities and their abilities?  he asked. Edward Siskel, the city's top lawyer, said on Wednesday that the larger need for reform was npt in question. But the shift away from using court oversight drew criticism from Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan and activist groups. A plaintiffs' attorney in Wednesday's lawsuit said the city could enter a court-decree with the plaintiffs. Plaintiffs include six individuals along with groups including Black Lives Matter Chicago and Blocks Together. Kevin Graham, president of Chicago's police union, in a statement objected to the lawsuit's characterization of the department and said his offers are doing a phenomenal job in extremely dangerous circumstances.

Papadimitriou made the comments in an interview with German newspaper Die Welt published on Thursday, when euro zone finance ministers are expected to reach a compromise deal that frees up new loans for Greece while putting off decisions on debt relief.  Even Wolfgang Schaeuble said that we met the requirements, but then he changed his mind,  Papadimitriou told the newspaper.  I haven't met Schaeuble yet and I don't want to be impolite, but his behaviour seems dishonest to me.  A spokesman for Schaeuble told a government news conference on Wednesday he expected agreement on a sustainable overall package at Thursday's meeting, but said there was no guarantee that Athens would get debt relief. Schaeuble said on Tuesday he was confident that Greece would reach a deal with lender this week. Last month he said everything pointed to stronger growth in Greece. On Wednesday, his spokesman said it remained Germany's view that debt relief measures for Greece could only be decided after the existing third bailout ends in 2018. Papadimitriou said German resistance to debt relief for Greece raised questions about the very idea and structure of the euro zone. The success of right-wing populists in Europe also showed dissatisfaction with such European structures, he said.  Greece is being made a sacrificial lamb,  he said. Papadimitriou also warned Schaeuble against making decisions based purely on domestic politics, noting that Germany had also received debt relief when it was rebuilding after World War Two. Debt relief is needed to help Greece expand its economy, he said, noting that Athens was not asking for a debt cut, but rather lower interest rates or longer repayment schedules. Social Democrats in the European Parliament also urged Schaeuble to drop his resistance to debt relief for Greece. Gianni Pittella, head of the Socialists in the European body, told Die Welt newspaper that it was unfair to hold Greece hostage, and said it was time to come toward Athens after years of enduring harsh reforms.  Holding Greece hostage for domestic reasons would be tantamount to suicide for Europe,  he told the newspaper.

Five of the officials, including Michigan Health and Human Services Director Nick Lyon, were charged with involuntary manslaughter stemming from their roles in handling the crisis, Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette said in a statement.   Involuntary manslaughter is a felony that carries a sentence of up to 15 years in prison. Lyon, 49, was also charged with one count of misconduct in office. The felony charge carries a sentence of up to five years in prison. Four current and former state and Flint officials were also charged with involuntary manslaughter. The four had all been previously charged with lesser crimes in connection with the water crisis.  The state's chief medical executive, Eden Wells, was charged Wednesday with obstruction of justice and lying to police. Michigan Governor Rick Snyder said in a statement that Lyon and Wells have his  full faith and confidence  and would remain on duty and help in Flint's recovery. An attorney for Lyon could not be reached for comment. It was not immediately known if Wells had an attorney. Schuette said his team had not spoken with Snyder as part of the investigation.  We attempted to interview the governor. We were not successful,  Schuette said. He declined to elaborate.

Some critics have called for high-ranking state officials, including Snyder, to be charged. Snyder previously said he believed he had not done anything criminally wrong.  The governor isn't going to speculate on where the investigation is or is not headed, but he continues to cooperate fully,  Snyder's spokeswoman Anna Heaton said.  Snyder's attorney, Brian Lennon, said in a statement that Snyder was made available to testify under oath this spring after being told a subpoena would be produced, but that never occurred. He added that Snyder previously testified under oath to Congress. Wednesday's charges stem from more than 80 cases of Legionnaires' disease, including the fatalities, that were believed to be linked to the water in Flint after the city switched its source to the Flint River from Lake Huron in April 2014. Lyon was aware of the Legionnaires' outbreak in Genesee County at least one year before he informed the public, according to court documents. His deliberate failure to inform the public resulted in the death of Genesee Township resident Robert Skidmore, 85, from Legionnaires' in December 2015, the documents said.   Wells lied to police about when she became aware of the outbreak, according to the documents. She also threatened a team of independent researchers who were studying the source of the disease, court documents said.  It's good to seeÂ that state Attorney General Schuette and his team are taking this matter seriously,  Flint Mayor Karen Weaver said in a statement.  We allÂ are waiting to see what else the investigation uncovers.  The crisis in Flint erupted in 2015 when tests found high amounts of lead in blood samples taken from children in the predominantly black city of about 100,000. The more corrosive river water caused lead to leach from pipes and into the drinking water. Lead levels in Flint's drinking water have now fallen below levels considered dangerous by federal regulators, state officials said last January. Others charged with involuntary manslaughter on Wednesday included former state-appointed emergency manager Darnell Earley, former Flint city employee Howard Croft, and former state Department of Environmental Quality officials Stephen Busch and Liane Shekter-Smith.

AIG and IBM completed a pilot of a so-called  smart contract  multi-national policy for Standard Chartered Bank PLC which the companies said is the first of its kind using blockchain's digital ledger technology. The Standard Chartered policy uses blockchain to facilitate sharing of real-time information for a main policy written in the United Kingdom, where the bank is headquartered, and three local policies in the United States, Singapore and Kenya. Big banks, investors and other financial institutions have invested millions of dollars in blockchain, hoping it could make transactions faster, easier and more secure. IBM has been partnering with leading companies in various industries, including Danish transport company Maersk , to create blockchain-based products that can streamline complex international dealings across sectors. Blockchain technology, which powers the digital currency bitcoin, enables data sharing across a network of individual computers. It has gained worldwide popularity due to its usefulness in recording and keeping track of assets or transactions across all industries. Multinational insurance coverage is often cumbersome because of a maze of international regulations, paperwork, and payment terms.  There's a lot of back and forth and it's all through email chains going around the world, instead of a centralized system,  Carol Barton, President of AIG Multinational said in an interview. A master policy is typically issued in the country where a company is headquartered, while affiliates often need coverage in other countries that impose varying rules, documentation, and payment terms. The real-time system allows companies, their units, and insurers, among others, to simultaneously share all data and documents about the policies, the companies said. It also notifies all of those involved about payments. The territories selected for Standard Chartered's coverage each introduced a level of complexity for testing the technology, IBM said. For example, a Kenya regulation, known as  cash before cover,  requires policyholders to pay for their coverage before it is valid.

With the last six majors producing six first-time winners and fitness concerns hanging over some of golf's biggest names, there is an air of uncertainty whistling through the knee high fescue at this year's U.S. Open. Adding to the unpredictability is the venue Erin Hills, a sprawling links style layout nestled in the bucolic Wisconsin countryside, that will be making its major debut. At a monstrous 7,741 yards Erin Hills will be the first par 72 U.S. Open since 1992 at Pebble Beach.  We are excited about this site,  said Mike Davis, executive director of the United States Golf Association.  We really do believe Erin Hills meets all of the criteria.  When we looked at Erin Hills we looked at what the test of golf would be.  We think it is a good test. A different kind of test.      Reigning U.S. Open champion Dustin Johnson and Phil Mickelson kept the golf world guessing whether they would or would not be in Erin Hills this week. Johnson ended that speculation on Tuesday when he arrived in time for a practise round after partner Paulina Gretzky had given birth to their second child.

Mandatory Credit: Rob Schumacher-USA TODAY SportsMickelson, however, who needs a U.S. Open victory to complete a career grand slam, was going to take it down to the wire, hoping enough rain and bad weather will delay Thursday's start to allow him to attend his daughter's graduation and fly from San Diego to Erin in time for his 2:20 PM CT (1920 GMT). Major winners world number one Johnson, Northern Irishman number two Rory McIlroy and Australian number three Jason Day all are big hitters and come to a layout that should favor them. But there are questions over their form.  I mean the golf course I really like it,  said Johnson, who is trying to become the first repeat champion since Curtis Strange in 1989.  It's a typical U.S. Open venue where the fact is that you have to hit the fairways. You can't really play from the rough.

Mandatory Credit: Rob Schumacher-USA TODAY Sports It's a difficult championship to win. It always plays very difficult.  Johnson, who missed the U.S. Masters after hurting his back, failed to make the halfway cut at the Memorial tournament last week while McIlroy has not played in nearly a month, since reporting back problems at the Players Championship. Day, who pulled out of the WGC Dell Match Play to be with mother while she battled cancer, has slowly found some form following a tie for 60th at the Players with a runnerup finish at the Byron Nelson. American young guns world number five Jordan Spieth, the 2015 U.S. Open winner, and number nine Rickie Fowler, zeroing in on a maiden major, will spearhead the American charge along with Johnson. An American has hoisted the trophy the last two years and a strong international field will be determined to prevent a U.S. hat-trick of titles. Masters champion Sergio Garcia of Spain and runner-up Justin Rose of England drive the ball just about as well as anyone, as does Australian Adam Scott, while South Africans Charl Schwartzel and Louis Oosthuizen are always a threat.

The melee outside the Turkish ambassador's residence during Erdogan's visit to the United States last month strained U.S.-Turkish relations. Eleven people were hurt in what Washington's police chief described as a  brutal attack  on peaceful protesters. Washington police said in a brief statement that Sinan Narin of Virginia was accused of felony aggravated assault and misdemeanor assault. The second man, Eyup Yildirim of New Jersey, faces two felony assault charges and a misdemeanor assault charge. Yildirim is in custody after an initial appearance before a federal magistrate in Newark, a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's Office in New Jersey said by phone. The police statement did not say if the men were supporters of Erdogan, part of his security detail or protesters. Two people, at least one of them a protester, had previously been charged. A video posted online showed men in dark suits chasing anti-government protesters and punching and kicking them as police struggled to intervene. The Turkish Embassy did not respond to a request for comment on Wednesday. It has blamed the violence on demonstrators linked to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, which Turkey and the United States consider a terrorist group. The New York Times reported that law enforcement officials planned to announce charges on Thursday against a dozen members of the Turkish president's security detail. Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser and Police Chief Peter Newsham are scheduled to hold a news conference at 11:45 a.m. on Thursday to provide an update on the incident. The Justice Department did not respond to requests for comment. In a statement, the State Department said it was committed to holding those responsible for the violence accountable.  Any further steps will be responsive and proportional to the charges,  it said. The fracas in the streets of the U.S. capital brought condemnation from members of the U.S. Congress and city officials. The State Department has said it had made its concern known to Turkey  in the strongest possible terms.  The incident took place after Erdogan met U.S. President Donald Trump.

Kalanick, under fire for crass behavior and fostering a culture of sexism and rule-breaking, in early March announced he was searching for a COO to help run the ride-services company. But in the months since, Uber has suffered a string of controversies and embarrassing setbacks and the job has remained unfilled - part of a leadership vacuum that extends through the company and up to the board of directors. In a report released Tuesday, former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder and his law firm, Covington & Burling, recommended sweeping management changes at Uber in the wake of sexual harassment allegations and other scandals.  The report advocates for a COO who  will act as a full partner  and run  day-to-day operations.  It also calls on the board of directors to take steps to limit the CEO's responsibilities and provide  clear lines of demarcation between  the COO and the CEO.  The way the COO job is written in the recommendations makes it a really powerful and important job,  said Bradley Tusk, an Uber investor and adviser.  Executive recruiters and tech investors agreed that the job might look more appealing now than it did before Tuesday's report. Still, it remains unclear if the company can attract a top-notch leader while Kalanick retains both the CEO title and, along with two allies, voting control of the company.  Kalanick said on Tuesday he was stepping aside at Uber because he needed time to grieve his recently deceased mother and work on his leadership shortcomings, according to a staff email seen by Reuters. He also said his leave  may be shorter or longer than we might expect.  Such ambiguity will effect Uber's efforts to rebuild its executive ranks, startup experts say.  The lack of clarity around Travis' position hangs over everything,  said Bill Aulet, managing director of the entrepreneurship center at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  You're dealing with the most important thing, which is, who is your boss?  Vacancies at the Top In the meantime, 14 people who report to Kalanick are charged with running the company until the CEO returns or a COO is hired. The company also is without a chief financial officer, general counsel and a head of engineering, among other open positions.  We have a strong leadership team including veterans who helped make the business what it is today and new talent who are helping to drive the changes we're committed to making,  Uber said in a statement. Uber is struggling to recruit new employees and has many who are eager to leave. Ed Zschau, founder of Inductus Associates, an executive search firm for startups, said his firm has  people from Uber in the search process  for a new job, including senior-level employees.  If the board can be recomposed a bit and get the company back on track, who the COO is will be an important signal as to whether people will want to work there,  Zschau said. Concerns about a lack of leadership extend to the board of directors. Holder's recommendations, including prohibiting romantic relationships between bosses and their subordinates and drinking on the job, suggest the Uber board failed to ensure the company had even the most basic checks and balances, say experts.  The Holder report could have been written by a law student who took an introductory corporate governance course,  said Erik Gordon, a technology and entrepreneurship expert at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business.  The board shares responsibility for the wreck.  Uber retained Holder's firm in February after a female former employee publicly accused the company of brazen sexual harassment. A wake of scandals followed, including a criminal investigation of the company's use of technology to evade regulators, a lawsuit alleging stolen self-driving car technology and a string of allegations relating to a toxic culture. On Tuesday, David Bonderman, a founder of private equity firm TPG Capital, an Uber investor, resigned from the board after making a sexist comment about women talking too much at the Uber staff meeting convened to discuss the Holder report. The resignation leaves Uber's board with seven voting members and four vacant seats.  Unlike the boards of most big companies, Uber's directors have little executive experience. In addition to Kalanick, the board includes co-founder and Chairman Garrett Camp, early employee Ryan Graves, venture capitalist Bill Gurley, Saudi investor Yasir al-Rumayyan and media impresaria Arianna Huffington. Wan Ling Martello, an executive vice president at Nestle, was added to the board this week as an independent director. The Holder recommendations call for a restructured board, but the recommendation to install an independent board chair  was left up to the board only to consider.

Videos taken during the raid show an armored truck smashing through the gates of the Los Verdes complex, in an operation that Interior Minister Nestor Reverol said resulted in the capture of 23 people who had been involved in attacks on security forces.  These subjects were involved in violent acts in which several officials were injured by gun fire,  Reverol said, describing clashes at a barricade close to the apartments as the trigger for the raid. Los Verdes is located in a Caracas neighborhood that has been the site of almost nightly clashes over two months since protests broke out against government restrictions on the opposition and chronic shortages of basic consumer goods.      With at least 68 killed since April, the increasing intensity of protests and the government response has led some to warn that Venezuela risks descending into deeper political violence. The government calls violent protesters  terrorists  who want to overthrow President Nicolas Maduro, and says that acts including attacks on police, the burning of vehicles and a looting and arson attack on a court building this week delegitimize their cause.

One resident said an agent shot her dog in the eye.  They are mafia criminals armed by the government,  said opposition lawmaker Tomas Guanipa, describing as  vandalism  the government action at the complex, which houses some 4,500 people.

Reverol said two people were killed in an accident when one motorcycle hit another after turning back from an opposition barricade on Wednesday. The opposition street movement has been fanned by Maduro's plan for July 30 elections for a special assembly to rewrite the constitution, which critics say are stacked in the government's favor and will result in the opposition-controlled congress being dissolved. The opposition is determined to stop the vote, calling instead for a presidential election.

(Reuters) - U.S. representatives Ron DeSantis and Jeff Duncan had ducked out of baseball practice early on Wednesday when a middle-aged man in the parking lot asked them if the players in red shirts on the field were Republicans or Democrats.  Republican,  Duncan said before departing. Minutes later, the man, rifle and handgun in tow, opened fire on the congressmen's teammates - Republican lawmakers gathered on a muggy morning near Washington to prepare for a charity ballgame.   A killing field,  U.S. Senator Rand Paul said in a televised interview, describing the scene in Arlington, Virginia.  We were sitting ducks,  said Representative Roger Williams. Williams, the team coach, told reporters he was hitting ground balls when he heard what sounded like a car engine backfiring.  He's got a gun! Run for cover,  Williams heard next. He dove into the dugout behind first base. Zack Barth, a staffer shot in the leg, ran in from the outfield and landed in Williams' arms. Rep. Mike Doyle (D-PA) and Rep.

BernsteinBarth texted for help as more bullets flew. U.S. Senator Jeff Flake used his belt as a makeshift tourniquet to stop the staffer's bleeding, Williams said. Taking cover behind home plate, U.S. Representative Mo Brooks saw a rifle pointing from a chain link fence behind the third base dugout.  A scream rang out from second base, Brooks said.

Victim down in the baseball field.â Alexandria police arrived at 7:12 a.m., about three minutes after the first emergency phone call reporting an active shooter. Members of the Capitol Police, serving as security detail to Scalise, were firing at the gunman.

That is beginning to change.        S&P; Global has begun to quiz states, cities and towns about their cyber defenses, and some credit analysts are starting to factor cyber security when they look at bonds. Moody's Investors Service is also trying to figure out how to best evaluate cyber risk. The shift follows a particularly steep rise in ransomware attacks, when criminals hold an entity's computer system hostage until a small ransom is paid. The number of global ransomware detections rose 36 percent in 2016 from the year before, to 463,841, with the United States most heavily affected, according to cyber security firm Symantec Corp. Such attacks, which have also hit companies and federal entities, have spared no kind of municipal issuer large or small, from police departments to school districts and transit agencies. Ransomware attacks on state and local governments and their agencies have risen in proportion with the overall increase, according to cyber insurance provider Beazley Group.  State and local governments are a huge target, quite frankly an easy target for bad guys,  said Bob Anderson, managing director for information security at Navigant management consulting firm in Washington and a former global cyber investigator at the Federal Bureau of Investigation.  Last month's  WannaCry  ransomware attack, which hobbled global businesses and Britain's National Health Service, may also be prompting renewed focus on cyber security, though it had minimal impact in the United States. Considering a potential cyber attack as a similar risk to a natural disaster, S&P; has already been reviewing cyber security defenses of utilities, hospitals and colleges because they were early public sector targets for hackers. Now it is also beginning to ask cities and states about the costs and level of security measures and the financial impact of successful attacks, said Geoffrey Buswick, who manages S&P;'s public sector ratings.  Head in the Sand The answers feed into broader categories that affect an issuer's ratings, particularly governance, liquidity and operations. FILE PHOTO: An advertisement about the Microsoft Cybercrime Center plays behind a window reflecting a nearby building at the Microsoft office in Cambridge, Massachusetts, U.S. May 15, 2017.Brian Snyder/File PhotoMany breaches are handled quickly and financial damage is limited, but not every attack will necessarily end that way, Buswick said.  We're trying to get sense of who has their head in the sand and who doesn't.  Fitch Ratings said it does not consider cyber security in its ratings, and many investors still are not concerned enough to ask for details.  In part, that is because it can be difficult to assess the operational and financial fallout of such attacks. Some high profile breaches so far have also done limited damage to issuers' finances. Case in point is the state of South Carolina, which in August 2012 suffered possibly the worst cyber attack yet of any city or state.  FILE PHOTO: A man types on a computer keyboard in this illustration picture taken February 28, 2013.Kacper Pempel/File PhotoWhen hackers stole the personal data of more than 3.5 million taxpayers, the state had to investigate, provide credit monitoring and consumer fraud protection, and implement a slew of post-breach upgrades, according to State Senator Thomas Alexander. The total cost is around $76 million and counting, he said. That is enough to pay for several school programs combined. But against South Carolina's annual general fund budget of roughly $8 billion, the costs made no dent in its standing as a borrower. Many issuers do not disclose any information to potential investors in bond documents about cyber risks or defenses. But a few, particularly hospitals and utilities, have started doing so. In a February prospectus, the Maryland Health and Higher Educational Facilities Authority, the state's largest public debt issuer, included nearly a full page devoted to the growing risk of cyber attacks.  Because we're such a large issuer, and because healthcare is often treated much more like a corporate credit, the legal counsels to the transaction weigh in on the bondholder risk section,  said Annette Anselmi, the authority's Executive Director, noting that such disclosures also evolve depending on what kinds of questions the market is asking. Hospitals are also ahead on cyber security disclosure because they rely on huge amounts of data, said Court Street Group analyst Joseph Krist. Eventually, he expects others to follow suit.  We went through this with getting munis to ... disclose more pension information. Those were frankly long and painful processes. It just has to get to a critical mass.

More than 200 firefighters, backed up by 40 fire engines, fought for hours to try to control the blaze, London's deadliest for a generation. The Grenfell Tower apartment block was home to about 600 people. A local residents' group said it had predicted such a catastrophe on their low-rent housing estate that overlooks affluent parts of the Kensington area of the capital, and London Mayor Sadiq Khan said there were questions to answer. Prime Minister Theresa May promised there would be a proper investigation into the disaster, which delayed her talks on trying to secure a parliamentary deal to stay in power and launch talks on Britain's exit from the European Union. Some residents screamed for help from behind upper-floor windows and others tried to throw children to safety as flames raced through the Grenfell block of about 120 apartments just before 1 a.m. Firefighters said they had rescued 65 people - some in pyjamas - from the 43-year-old block.  We could see a lot of children and parents screaming for 'Help! Help! Help!' and putting their hands on the window and asking to help them,  Amina Sharif told Reuters.  We could do nothing and we could see the stuff on the side was falling off, collapsing. We were just standing screaming and they were screaming.  Tying Sheets Together Another witness, Saimar Lleshi, saw people tying together sheets to try to escape.  Related CoverageFactbox: Grenfell Tower - the London apartment block that went up in flamesMore people may still be inside burning London tower apartment: police I saw three people putting sheets together to climb down, but no one climbed down. I donât know what happened to them. Even when the lights went off, people were waving with white shirts to be seen,  Lleshi said. The fire sent up plumes of smoke that could be seen from miles away. The ambulance service said 68 people were being treated in hospital, with 18 in critical condition. More than 16 hours after the fire started, crews were still trying to douse flames as they sought to reach the top floors. But London police commander Stuart Cundy told reporters he did not believe further survivors would be found in the building.  At a nearby community center used to house some of those rescued, tensions were rising as occupants waited for news.   The burnt building of Grenfell Tower apartment block at Latimer Road in West London is seen in the foreground, Britain June 14, 2017.Paul Hackett The fire, which was unprecedented in its scale and speed, will be subject to a full fire investigation,  said Steve Apter from the London Fire Brigade.  Any lessons learnt from this will be borne out not just across London, across the UK - and lessons learnt globally.   The emergency services said it was too early to say what had caused the inferno, which left the block a charred, smoking shell. Some residents said no alarm had sounded. Others said they had warned repeatedly about fire safety in the block. The building had recently undergone an 8.7 million pound  ($11.08 million) exterior refurbishment, which included new external cladding and windows.  We will cooperate with the relevant authorities and emergency services and fully support their enquiries into the causes of this fire at the appropriate time,  Rydon, the firm behind the refurbishment work, said in a statement. Children Thrown to Safety Slideshow (31 Images)Residents who escaped told how they woke up to the smell of burning and rushed to leave through smoke-filled corridors and stairwells. There were reports that some leapt out of windows. Other witnesses spoke of children including a baby being thrown to safety from high windows. Tamara, one witness, told the BBC:  There's people, like, throwing their kids out, 'Just save my children, just save my children!' . Opposition Labour party leader Jeremy Corbyn said sprinkler systems should be installed in such blocks and he called on the government to make a statement in parliament. Fire Minister Nick Hurd said local authorities and fire services across the country would assess tower blocks undergoing similar renovation work to provide reassurance.  In due course when the scene is secure, when it is possible to identify the cause of this fire, there will be proper investigation and if there are any lessons to be learned, they will be and action will be taken,  May said. Khan, the London mayor, said there needed to be answers after some residents said they had been advised they should stay in their flats in the event of a fire.  What we can't have is a situation where people's safety is put at risk because of bad advice being given or, if it is the case, as has been alleged, of tower blocks not being properly serviced or maintained,  Khan said. Resident Michael Paramasivan told BBC radio he had spoken to a woman who lived on the 21st floor:  She has got six kids. She left with all six of them. When she got downstairs, there was only four of them with her. She is now breaking her heart.

They see Fed policymakers raising the bankâs key overnight borrowing rate one more time by the end of 2017 and three times in 2018 despite growing concerns that inflation would fall short of their 2.0 percent goal in the foreseeable future, according to the poll.  The balance sheet plan seems more aggressive than previously thought,  said James Sweeney, chief economist at Credit Suisse, one of the 23 firms that do business directly with the Federal Reserve. Fourteen of the 21 primary dealers surveyed said the Fed would announce the start of its balance sheet normalization at its Sept. 19-20 policy meeting. The rest of them said it would make such a move at its Dec. 12-13 meeting. In a June 2 Reuters poll, six of 17 primary dealers thought an announcement would come in September, while the rest forecast it would occur at the last policy meeting of 2017. Earlier Wednesday, the Federal Reserve's policy-setting group, the Federal Open Market Committee, offered more details on its plan to start reducing its monthly reinvestments of maturing Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities. The Fed also raised its benchmark overnight rates by a quarter point to 1.00-1.25 percent as expected. Primary dealers had forecast the Fed would start gradually unwinding its $2.46 trillion worth of government debt and $1.77 trillion of mortgage bonds. A number of Fed officials have spoken of the likelihood of  the central bank scaling back its bond holdings which the Fed  amassed after the 2008 financial crisis in order to keep long-term interest rates low to support economic growth.   We could put this into effect relatively soon,  Fed Chair Janet Yellen said at a news conference after the FOMC meeting on Wednesday about paring the Fed's bond holdings. The Fed's conviction that it was ready to back away from its unconventional monetary policy caught some traders off guard as bond yields recovered slightly after falling sharply earlier in the day on a weaker-than-forecast report on Consumer Price Index in May. This focus on balance sheet reduction led economists at Wall Street's top firms to push out their outlook on the next rate hike to December from September.

The Nasdaq cut its loss in more than half in a late rebound, having earlier fallen 1 percent, while financials buoyed the Dow industrials. The U.S. central bank cited continued U.S. economic growth and job market strength, proceeding with its first tightening cycle in more than a decade. But some investors worried about the Fed's hawkish tone and that concerns about rate hikes were being reflected in the tech sector, which has led the S&P; 500's nearly 9-percent rally this year. The tech sector fell 0.5 percent, recovering from steeper losses in the session and coming on the heels of its biggest two-day swoon in nearly a year. Tech remains up 18 percent in 2017.  I think itâs more of what we saw starting last week, where you have a very crowded trade ... If they are going to get more nervous about the stock market, thatâs where you are going to see the selling,  said William Delwiche, Investment Strategist at Robert W. Baird & Co in Milwaukee. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 46.09 points, or 0.22 percent, to 21,374.56, the S&P; 500 lost 2.43 points, or 0.10 percent, to 2,437.92 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 25.48 points, or 0.41 percent, to 6,194.89. Earlier on Wednesday, data showed U.S. consumer prices unexpectedly fell in May and retail sales recorded their biggest drop in 16 months.  The kiss of death for tech stocks is negative GDP or a slowdown in the software and equipment component,  said Daniel Morgan, portfolio manager at Synovus Trust in Atlanta.  Hence, the tech sector is selling off on concerns that todayâs Fed hike will slow GDP, retarding future tech profit growth.   Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S.,  June 2, 2017.Brendan McDermidFinancials, which have underperformed this year and tend to benefit in a rising rate environment, rallied late to close up 0.2 percent. The group had fallen as much as 1.3 percent during the session. The energy sector dropped 1.8 percent as oil prices weakened. U.S. data showed an unexpectedly large weekly build in U.S. gasoline inventories and International Energy Agency (IEA) data projected a big increase in non-OPEC output in 2018. The Dow Jones Transport Average index, seen by some as a barometer of economic activity, ended down 0.7 percent. The Fed clearly outlined a plan to reduce its $4.2-trillion portfolio of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, most of which were purchased in the wake of the 2007-2009 financial crisis and recession.  The market should take confidence in the fact that theyâre being very transparent in setting clear policy steps in terms of how they normalize the balance sheet,  said Heidi Learner, chief economist for Savills Studley, a unit of Savills Plc, in New York.  Certainly more transparency is a good thing.  In corporate news, Alexion shares jumped 9.3 percent and were the biggest percentage gainers on the S&P; 500 after the biotechnology company named Biogen's chief financial officer as its CFO. Biogen's stock fell 3.1 percent. H & R Block rose 7.9 percent after the tax preparation service's quarterly revenue and profit beat analysts' expectations. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.13-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.41-to-1 ratio favored decliners. About 7.1 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, above the 6.8 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

Adam Neumann, whose company is now valued at some $17 billion, said the exchange where WeWork will list its shares is undecided, addressing a lunch event at the Economic Club of New York, held at the New York Stock Exchange. He praised NYSE Group President Tom Farley, who runs the exchange, for his persistence in seeking WeWork's listing. NYSE Group is owned by Intercontinental Exchange Inc (ICE.N). Neumann, who was quizzed by Farley in front of almost 200 people at the lunch, said his company will conduct an IPO, but did not say when that might occur. The company, which operates 149 locations in 15 countries, now has about 120,000 members who pay on average $650 a month each, Neumann said. Five to 10 new sites open every month. WeWork has raised about $1.8 billion from investors and venture capital funds since it began operations six years ago. SoftBank Group Corp (9984.T) invested $300 million in WeWork in March, the first of a much larger funding round that could total up to $3 billion, according to a person familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity. Two years ago, less than 1 percent of WeWork's business was generated by Fortune 500-type companies. That figure is now about 30 percent and growing, Neumann said, interpreting that as a sign of a viable business model. A communal housing model called WeLive, which the company has launched in New York City and Crystal City, Virginia, is 100-percent leased, but Neumann said the are no immediate plans to expand the concept as WeWork tries to perfect the product.

The latest outlook from the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) comes three months after it warned that Australia's most populous states face a gas shortfall from the end of 2018 that could spark power or gas cuts to homes and businesses. That warning, a string of blackouts and soaring energy prices led the Australian government and states to step in to shore up supply, including restarting a mothballed gas-fired power plant, funding huge storage batteries and limiting gas exports.  This latest analysis indicates there will be challenges that will need to be managed proactively on days of extreme conditions to maintain secure, reliable and affordable energy to Australian consumers,  AEMO Chief Executive Audrey Zibelman said in a statement. The AEMO said power supply should be adequate in normal summer weather, assuming 140 megawatts (MW) of energy storage backed by the South Australian and Victorian state governments is in place, there are no planned generator outages and three gas-fired generators return to service as promised. The market will need more coal-fired power in the state of New South Wales, more renewable power and higher output from gas-fired generators to replace a 1,600 MW plant shut by France's Engie SA in neighbouring Victoria in March. The grid would be most vulnerable in extreme heat on weekday afternoons and evenings when people switch on air conditioners, with the risk rising if the wind drops and the sun is down or other generation is disrupted at the same time, the AEMO said. Gas supply for two power stations that are being resuscitated to stabilise the grid will be key to avoiding power cuts, the body said in its Energy Supply Outlook (ESO).  The ESO analysis suggests gas supply remains tight, however, the latest industry projections of gas production are just sufficient to meet current projections of gas demand,  the AEMO said. Companies ranging from the world's biggest miners, BHP and Rio Tinto, to steelmakers and brickmakers have raised alarm over unstable power supplies and soaring prices, which are threatening jobs. The AEMO's outlook comes on the heels of a call by Australia's chief scientist calling for the federal government to set a  fuel neutral  clean energy target that provides an incentive to build new generation to cap soaring power prices, cut carbon emissions and keep the lights on.

Judge Laura Taylor Swain, who is presiding over the bankruptcy, revealed the mediation team in a court order on Wednesday. The group will be led by Judge Barbara Houser, the chief judge for the federal bankruptcy court in Dallas, and will include Judge Marrero, of the federal court in New York, and Judge Christopher Klein, the Sacramento-based federal bankruptcy judge who oversaw Stockton's restructuring. Circuit Judge Thomas Ambro, of the Third Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, and Senior District Judge Nancy Atlas, of the U.S. federal court in Houston, will round out the team.  Puerto Rico, the U.S. territory with $70 billion of debt and a 45 percent poverty rate, in May filed the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. municipal history. The case also promises to be one of the messiest, as already several investors have begun staking competing claims to the island's limited revenue sources.  The biggest fight is between the two largest creditor factions: holders of $18 billion in general obligation debt, which carries a constitutional guarantee, and more than $17 billion of bonds issued by COFINA, Puerto Rico's sales tax authority, backed by the tax revenue COFINA collects. Both groups say they have an ironclad claim on the COFINA revenue.  Swain, in her order, said participation in mediation would be voluntary, but that all parties would  be required to engage in good faith in preliminary discussions with representatives of the mediation team.   The team, in turn, would  develop a list of issues to be addressed.  In addition to Stockton, Judge Klein is known for presiding over the 2014 Chapter 11 bankruptcy of that city's Roman Catholic diocese.  Judge Marrero, born in Santurce, Puerto Rico, earned his law degree in 1968 from Yale Law School and has been a judge since 1999.

If McGregor pulls that off, it would rank among the greatest boxing upsets of all time.  Mayweather is widely regarded as one of the best defensive fighters ever, and prides himself on his ability to evade punishment with his skillful movement about the ring while making adjustments against opponents on the fly. McGregor, the UFC's reigning lightweight champion and former featherweight champion, is known as much for his bravado as for his explosive knockout power inside an MMA octagon. The Irishman became the first UFC fighter to hold two belts simultaneously when he knocked out Eddie Alvarez in New York last November for the lightweight championship. The UFC stripped McGregor of his featherweight belt shortly after that fight when he announced he would be taking some time off after he and long-time partner Dee Devlin had their first baby in May.Â  Â  Â  Known for his devastating striking and highlight-reel knockouts, McGregor is also quick and irrational on his feet, but few would back him to beat one of the most complete boxers of all time. A win for Mayweather would move him ahead of former heavyweight great Rocky Marciano, who also retired with a perfect 49-0 career record.

(Reuters) - The suspect who opened fire on Republican lawmakers as they played baseball on Wednesday raged against Republican U.S. President Donald Trump on social media and idolized Bernie Sanders, whom he saw as the only politician who understood the working class. Authorities identified the gunman as James Hodgkinson, a 66-year-old home inspector from the St. Louis suburb of Belleville, Illinois. He died from injuries sustained in a shoot-out with Capitol Hill police who were at the scene in Alexandria, Virginia, outside Washington.  Hodgkinson is believed by investigators to have been a person  of strong views,  a senior U.S. official said, without elaborating. The Belleville News-Democrat newspaper posted a photograph of Hodgkinson protesting outside a post office there in 2012, wearing sunglasses and a goatee and holding a homemade placard that read  TAX the Rich.  Hodgkinson was a member of many anti-Republican groups on Facebook including  The Road to Hell Is Paved With Republicans,   Terminate The Republican Party,  and  Donald Trump is not my President,  his profile showed before it was taken down. Trump won the U.S. presidential election in November. Republicans also control both chambers of Congress.  Trump is a Traitor. Trump Has Destroyed Our Democracy. It's Time to Destroy Trump & Co.  Hodgkinson wrote in a March 22 post. His profile picture was a U.S. flag with the slogan:  Democratic Socialism explained in 3 words: 'We the People.'  Hodgkinson went to Washington several weeks ago to protest against Trump's election, his brother told the New York Times. The former mayor of Alexandria, Bill Euille, said he talked with the suspect at the local YMCA most mornings for more than a month, and even tried to help find Hodgkinson a job after seeing he was living out of a gym bag, the Washington Post said. Stephen Brennwald, an Alexandria attorney, also saw Hodgkinson at the YMCA wearing long pants rather than gym attire, and said he often seemed to be staring into space.  It's just very freaky to think that this guy who was just sitting in there for weeks, not really doing anything, actually turned out to shoot at people,  Brennwald told Reuters.  'Despicable Act' Hodgkinson's Facebook profile featured a cover photo of Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont who ran unsuccessfully to be the Democratic Party's presidential candidate last year.  The house of James Hodgkinson, the Virginia shooting suspect, is seen in Belleville, Illinois, U.S., June 14, 2017.Kenny BahrSanders, an independent who ran as a progressive populist but was defeated by Hillary Clinton, said the suspect had  apparently volunteered  on his campaign. In a statement, Sanders condemned the shooting as a despicable act.  One woman who asked not to be named told Reuters that Hodgkinson had contacted her via Facebook as part of a political discussion, but that he subsequently commented on her page that Clinton was a  liar  and a  baby killer.   I actually blocked him at one point,  the woman said. A bartender at the Pork Barrel BBQ in Alexandria said Hodgkinson started coming in for beers about a month ago.   Slideshow (2 Images) He was a regular-looking guy that kind of gave you a sense of the creeps, but you can't really put your finger on it,  said Christina Shrimshaw, 27, who served him a handful of times but never remembered him discussing politics.  He would talk about very mundane things, like golf. He was big into watching the Golf Channel.    A neighbor in Belleville, William Schaumleffel, recalled how in March he heard gunshots and saw Hodgkinson shooting with a long gun toward woods across a corn field from his yard.   I yelled at him: 'Hey, stop shooting over there. There are houses over there,'  Schaumleffel said. Hodgkinson did not stop, he added, so he filed a report with the sheriff's office. Hodgkinson's criminal history included a 2006 arrest on battery charges that were later dismissed, as well as multiple traffic violations, according to state records that identified him as a 5-foot, 6-inch (1.67-metre) man weighing 190 pounds (86 kg), with brown eyes. Most of the infractions were ultimately dropped. Hodgkinson had been licensed as a home inspector and real estate appraiser, but did not renew his home inspector license after it expired last year, state records showed. His license to appraise real estate expired in 1997. According to Facebook, Hodgkinson went to Belleville Township High School West and studied flight training at Southwestern Illinois College. Beginning in mid-2015, Hodgkinson began expressing support for Sanders' 2016 campaign, and federal records showed he donated $18 to the effort.  Bernie is the Only Candidate in Decades that Really Cares about the Working Class,  Hodgkinson posted on June 13, 2016.

Judge Laura Taylor Swain, who is presiding over the bankruptcy, revealed the mediation team in a court order on Wednesday. The group will be led by Judge Barbara Houser, the chief judge for the federal bankruptcy court in Dallas, and will include Judge Marrero, of the federal court in New York, and Judge Christopher Klein, the Sacramento-based federal bankruptcy judge who oversaw Stockton's restructuring. Circuit Judge Thomas Ambro, of the Third Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, and Senior District Judge Nancy Atlas, of the U.S. federal court in Houston, will round out the team. Puerto Rico, the U.S. territory with $70 billion of debt and a 45 percent poverty rate, in May filed the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. municipal history. The case also promises to be one of the messiest, as already several investors have begun staking competing claims to the island's limited revenue sources. The biggest fight is between the two largest creditor factions: holders of $18 billion in general obligation debt, which carries a constitutional guarantee, and more than $17 billion of bonds issued by COFINA, Puerto Rico's sales tax authority, backed by the tax revenue COFINA collects. Both groups say they have an ironclad claim on the COFINA revenue. Swain, in her order, said participation in mediation would be voluntary, but that all parties would  be required to engage in good faith in preliminary discussions with representatives of the mediation team.  The team, in turn, would  develop a list of issues to be addressed.  In addition to Stockton, Judge Klein is known for presiding over the 2014 Chapter 11 bankruptcy of that city's Roman Catholic diocese. Judge Marrero, born in Santurce, Puerto Rico, earned his law degree in 1968 from Yale Law School and has been a judge since 1999.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/puertorico-debt-bankruptcy-idUSL1N1JB2MH"},

The new service is part of a push by the  fintech  - or financial technology - sector to compete with established financial institutions, by using digital technologies to offer cheaper and more user-friendly services, often via smartphones.   Boston-based Circle Internet operates its app-based peer-to-peer payment network using blockchain, the technology which first emerged as the system underpinning cryptocurrency bitcoin.   One of the most well-funded blockchain startups, its investors include Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) and Baidu Inc (BIDU.O).  Circle Internet's international money transfer service, built on a type of blockchain called Ethereum, will allow customers to send payments between U.S. dollars, British pound sterling or euros on their mobile phones. There are no fees or foreign exchange mark-ups.  International payments, according to Circle's chief executive officer and founder, Jeremy Allaire, should not take days to be processed and should be as easy and frictionless as sending an email.   When's the last time you sent a 'cross-border email'?  Allaire said in an interview.  The idea of cross-border payments is going to completely go away. ... Our vision is for there to be no distinction between international and domestic payments.   Circle, which processed over $1 billion in transactions in 2016 and whose customer base increased more than 10-fold in the year up to last month, does not make money from its payments service, nor does it plan to, as it reckons consumers expect these services to be free.    We don't think there is any money to be made in payments anymore,  said Allaire.  The entire business model of extracting a toll or having time delays around the movement of value is going away completely.  Instead, the company makes money by trading bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, both on digital currency exchanges and over the counter, at a time when the value of such web-based currencies has reached record highs. Last month alone, Circle traded over $800 million in digital assets, it said in a statement.

Hammond will address an annual gathering of London's financial elite, who fear that May's line that  no deal is better than a bad deal  will cost them business in the European Union. Britain's giant banking industry sees Hammond as its most powerful ally and bankers were worried when, in the run-up to the election, it appeared he might lose his job.  It is in everyone's interests that UK financial services remain strong and competitive,  City of London Lord Mayor Andrew Parmley is due to say at the Mansion House dinner where Hammond and Bank of England Governor Mark Carney will speak.  This sector should help shape our negotiations with the EU,  Parmley says, in speech excerpts released to media. Until a few days ago, it had seemed likely that Hammond would not be giving the Mansion House speech. Newspapers said he had fallen out with May's powerful aides and speculation was rife about who might replace him. But with May reeling from the loss of her Conservative Party's parliamentary majority in last week's election, she reappointed Hammond to his job, and it was her aides who lost theirs.  Hammond is in a much more powerful position than he used to be,  said a bank executive who regularly meets government officials.  Hammond is a pragmatist, he is business-friendly, and the Treasury have done all the serious work on Brexit.  In contrast to May's uncompromising rhetoric, Hammond has stressed the importance of ensuring that British employers can continue to find the skilled workers they need from the EU. On Friday, the day after the election, he tweeted:  Pleased to be re-appointed so we can now get on and negotiate a Brexit deal that supports British jobs, business and prosperity.  The Times newspaper reported on Wednesday that Hammond wanted May to keep Britain in the EU's customs union, a move that would allow tariff-free trade within the bloc but prevent trade deals with outside countries. May's Brexit strategy has become the subject of public debate inside her own party, with two former Conservative prime ministers urging her to soften her approach. Austerity Fatigue Hammond may also use his speech to signal how the government will respond to the message from many voters last week that they are weary of the spending cuts needed to turn Britain's budget deficit into a surplus, something the government says will take until the mid-2020s. The opposition Labour Party won many more votes than expected with its promises of measures such as the end to a 1-percent cap on public sector pay increases, and a higher minimum wage. Inflation is at its highest since 2013, at 2.9 percent, while growth in pay excluding bonuses lags at 1.7 percent, tightening the squeeze on households. Figures due to released at 0830 GMT on Thursday are expected to show retail sales fell in May. However, Hammond's options for a significant loosening of the purse strings appear limited, not only by his fiscally hawkish instincts and Britain's still weak public finances, but also by the Conservative Party's diminished clout.  Although many in parliament would agree with some change in the fiscal stance, it could be hard to reach agreement on a fully comprehensive package of fiscal measures and in particular how to fund them,  JP Morgan economist Allan Monks said. Also on Thursday, the Bank of England is set to signal once again that, with Britain's economy struggling to regain momentum, it is in no hurry to raise interest rates from their all-time low. Its policymakers are likely to focus more on the loss of spending power for many households than the acceleration in inflation, which they expect will prove a short-lived consequence of the fall in the pound after last year's Brexit vote. Growth slowed sharply in early 2017 and the BoE may see the uncertainty caused by May's election flop as another reason to keep borrowing costs low, or even consider providing further stimulus to help growth if needed. The BoE is due to publish its latest monetary policy statement at 1100 GMT.

A government review earlier this year led to a cut in the discount rate used to calculate the payments, to minus 0.75 percent from the 2.5 percent in place since 2001, a move which wiped millions off the profits of UK insurers.  The downward move in the rate means insurers need to pay out more in cash to claimants now to ensure that returns over their lifetime meet the awarded compensation, a hit to motor insurers' profitability. Admiral's pretax profit fell by 25 percent in 2016 after the car insurer took most of the hit from the rate change in last year's earnings, while Direct Line took a one-off hit to earnings. EY, which estimated the overall cost of the change in the so-called Ogden rate based on market announcements and its own calculations, said in a report released on Thursday that the change will cost British motor insurers and reinsurers 3.5 billion pounds ($4.5 billion) initially.  That includes about 2.4 billion pounds of losses that have been disclosed publicly to date, but does not include any margins insurers had already set aside for the Ogden rate change prior to the announcement. It also does not include the ongoing costs in 2017 and in future from accidents that will be settled at the new rate. Britain's motor insurance market reported significant underwriting losses in 2016, EY said. Net combined ratios for the sector - a measure of profitability in which a result above 100 percent indicates a loss - worsened to 109 percent last year from 100.5 percent in 2015.  EY sees further pressure on the ratio in 2017, with ongoing costs from the new Ogden rate and the need for insurers to rebuild reserve margins released to offset it. It expects the ratio to weaken by 3.1 percentage points compared to a year earlier, excluding the Ogden rate impact. Reform of whiplash injury claims, which insurers say have resulted in many fraudulent claims, and a review of Ogden methodology may bring some respite, EY said.   The general election result last week may have created additional uncertainty and insurers will be hoping that the Ogden consultation and reform of whiplash claims will remain priorities for the new Lord Chancellor and the government,  Tony Sault, UK general insurance market lead at EY, said.   The change in the Odgen rate along with high repair costs and a rise in insurance premium tax to 12 percent are also expected to push up already rising motor insurance rates by 9 percent in 2017 to an average of 503 pounds, EY said.

The move shows Google casting an increasingly wide net as it pumps cash into global medical research, seeding what it believes will become a core long-term healthcare business. Novartis and Verily, a unit of Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL.O), are cornerstone investors in the new fund, along with the European Investment Fund, Medicxi said on Thursday.  Verily already has deals with GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L), Sanofi (SASY.PA), Novartis and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) to apply novel technology in areas ranging from diabetes management to robotic surgery. Last month it landed former U.S. Food and Drug Administration head Robert Califf as part of its team. Another Google offshoot, Calico, is working on treatments to fight ageing, while the group's arms-length GV venture capital  operation has invested in dozens of healthcare start-ups, mostly in the United States. The latest initiative will now see it delving deeper into drug development by investing in late-stage European biotech companies.  The new fund will back both private and public firms with products that have already reached mid-stage Phase II clinical development, providing them with a new source of growth capital.  There is a funding gap because there is a maturing class of biotechnology companies now in Europe,  said Francesco De Rubertis, co-founder and partner at Medicxi. The fund is a first for Medicxi, the former life sciences arm of Index Ventures, which has so far invested in early-stage biotech. It also reflects the redrawing of traditional industry borders as tech companies take a hands-on role in healthcare innovation, as highlighted by the fact that Verily will appoint two members to the new fundâs scientific advisory board.     Other tech companies, including Apple (AAPL.O) and Microsoft (MSFT.O), are also investing in healthcare in the belief that modern computing capabilities and miniaturization can help accelerate advances in medical treatment. Europe boasts world-class universities and scientists, but its biotechnology sector has long been a poor relation to the bigger U.S. industry, where emerging life sciences firms are able to access a much deeper pool of capital. By providing funds for late-stage drug development, the hope is that more firms will be able to stay independent and continue to build up the value of their experimental medicines, rather than selling out prematurely to larger players. De Rubertis said much of the investment was likely to be channeled to companies in Britain, Switzerland and a region spanning Paris-Brussels-Amsterdam. Europe has only a small roster of successful biotechs, such as Danish cancer specialist Genmab (GEN.CO), currently worth $13 billion, and Switzerland's Actelion. Actelion was Europe's top biotech firm for many years, thanks to its market-leading position in pulmonary arterial hypertension, before it was bought by J&J; this year for $30 billion. Total revenues for Europe's biotech industry were $25 billion in 2015 against $108 billion for the U.S. industry, according to consultancy EY.

As its manufacturing engine sputters, the world's second largest economy is increasingly relying on infrastructure spending to boost growth, spurring demand for construction steel products and lifting producer profit margins to near record levels. Combined with recent cuts to low-quality steel capacity amid a war on pollution, this infrastructure drive looks set to brighten the outlook for construction-grade steelmakers just as their more sophisticated peers wrestle with sluggish demand from manufacturers and automakers.  Because of capacity cuts and expected stronger infrastructure spending by China, there's a strong upside for long products consumption which can boost rebar makers' profits in the years ahead,  said Richard Lu, analyst at CRU consultancy in Beijing. The profit margin on construction steel product rebar, also known as long steel, has surged more than 800 percent this year to around 1,100 yuan ($162) per tonne in early June, according to data tracked by brokerage CLSA.  The margin for cold rolled coil, or CRC - otherwise referred to as flat steel - used in cars and home appliances, has dropped 47 percent to around 437 yuan over the same period. Margins for high-end products like CRC have usually been higher than for rebar. Between 2012 and 2016, the average margin for CRC was 341 yuan per tonne compared to 107 yuan for rebar, CLSA data showed. That has spurred mills in the world's top steel producer to reopen once-shut rebar production lines to cash-in on soaring prices. The strong demand has also cut traders' inventories of rebar by more than half in less than four months.  Our boss saw good profit on rebar, so he decided to resume the lines which had been shut for two years,  said a sales manager at Rizhao Steel Holding Group, a midsize steel producer in China's eastern Shandong Province.  The lines are expected to keep operating as the outlook for construction steel is good.  'No Choice' Improving infrastructure is high on Chinese President Xi Jinping's agenda as he promotes his ambitious Belt and Road initiative - building road and rail connections with Central Asia and beyond. Meantime, manufacturing has struggled, with China's car sales falling for a second straight month in May for the first time since 2015, limiting demand for high-value flat products like CRC. The reversal of fortune between Chinese producers of cheap, low-grade construction steel and makers of high-value steel was also triggered by Beijing's crackdown on industrial pollution. As it battles smog, China has vowed to eliminate induction furnaces - a highly polluting type of plant that produces mostly rebar - by the end of this month.  FILE PHOTO: Stacks of rebar await delivery at Shanxi Zhongsheng Iron and Steel in Fenyang, Shanxi Province, China, April 28, 2016.John Ruwitch/File PhotoAnalysts estimate induction furnaces produced about 50 million tonnes of rebar last year - about a quarter of China's total rebar output.  So far this year, average margins for rebar were 572 yuan per tonne compared with 91 yuan in all of 2016, CLSA data showed.    The unexpected resurgence among producers of lower grade, cheaper steel is a setback for China's efforts to modernize its massive steel sector, mainly by pushing the big, sophisticated steelmakers to swallow smaller rivals and shut inefficient ones.  Last year, China's most technologically advanced steelmaker Baosteel acquired rival Wuhan Iron and Steel, creating the world's second-largest steelmaker behind ArcelorMittal. Some Chinese mills that produce both long and flat steel products are making more of the former because of the robust margins, said Daniel Meng, a Hong Kong-based analyst at CLSA.    It is quite a general phenomenon,  said Meng.  You should see such switching across many mills rather than just a small number of mills.  But some mills that make only flat steel products could not shut their plants.  Although flat producers realize the margin is narrowing, they have no choice but to continue producing since it would cost more money to stop the equipment and turn it on again when profit goes better,  said a manager of a unit of state-owned Shandong Iron and Steel Group.  At around 437 yuan a tonne in early June, the margin on flat steel CRC was less than half of where it was in late January, CLSA data showed. While Chinese traders' stockpiles of both rebar and CRC have fallen from this year's peaks, rebar inventory has dropped 56 percent while CRC stocks have fallen only 13 percent, data compiled by SteelHome consultancy showed.  Higher Exports? As domestic appetite slows, more flat steel products from China are being sold overseas. They totaled 14.85 million tonnes during January-April, or 55 percent of total steel exports. In 2016, flat steel shipments were 48.03 million tonnes and made up 44 percent of total exports. The increased proportion of high-end steel shipments this year could raise fresh concerns that China may be open to renewed accusations of steel dumping on international markets.   Chinese steelmakers  have previously been accused of selling material at below cost, in order to offload their excess supply,  said Jeremy Platt from UK steel consultancy MEPS.  Amid a weak domestic trading environment, Chinese suppliers could be encouraged, in the coming months, to increase their export volumes.

The original budget when Brazil won the right to host the Games in 2009 was around 28.8 billion reais. The total announced on Wednesday could still rise further, but it was in keeping with expectations that had been revised during the countdown to South America's first ever Olympics. The cost is below the 8.92 billion pounds ($14.3 billion) spent on London 2012, but still more than twice the $5.2 billion average cost of hosting the Summer Games, according to a 2015 study by the University of Oxford and Said Business School. Some 7.23 billion reais was spent on venues, AGLO said. The Globo sports website reported that the cost of infrastructure projects rose to 26.7 billion reais and another 9.2 billion reais was spent on operating costs. Rio de Janeiro, which hosted the Olympics in August and the Paralympics in September, has been criticized for a lack of legacy planning, with some of the venues abandoned soon after the closing ceremony. Other infrastructure projects, including a new metro line that does not extend all the way to the main Olympic Park, have had their effectiveness questioned. Officials said that legacy planning was a major challenge but that they intended to hold an average of three events a month at the Olympic venues starting this June, a number they hope will increase to 10 events a month by December.  It's not easy to manage the legacy,  AGLO president Paulo Marcio Dias Mello told reporters.  London, for example, took two years to deliver the legacy and even today there is public investment in that legacy.

Judge Laura Taylor Swain, who is presiding over the bankruptcy, revealed the mediation team in a court order on Wednesday. The group will be led by Judge Barbara Houser, the chief judge for the federal bankruptcy court in Dallas, and will include Judge Marrero, of the federal court in New York, and Judge Christopher Klein, the Sacramento-based federal bankruptcy judge who oversaw Stockton's restructuring. Circuit Judge Thomas Ambro, of the Third Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, and Senior District Judge Nancy Atlas, of the U.S. federal court in Houston, will round out the team.  Puerto Rico, the U.S. territory with $70 billion of debt and a 45 percent poverty rate, in May filed the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. municipal history. The case also promises to be one of the messiest, as already several investors have begun staking competing claims to the island's limited revenue sources.  The biggest fight is between the two largest creditor factions: holders of $18 billion in general obligation debt, which carries a constitutional guarantee, and more than $17 billion of bonds issued by COFINA, Puerto Rico's sales tax authority, backed by the tax revenue COFINA collects. Both groups say they have an ironclad claim on the COFINA revenue.  Swain, in her order, said participation in mediation would be voluntary, but that all parties would  be required to engage in good faith in preliminary discussions with representatives of the mediation team.   The team, in turn, would  develop a list of issues to be addressed.  In addition to Stockton, Judge Klein is known for presiding over the 2014 Chapter 11 bankruptcy of that city's Roman Catholic diocese.  Judge Marrero, born in Santurce, Puerto Rico, earned his law degree in 1968 from Yale Law School and has been a judge since 1999.

The Philippines military has previously said the United States was providing technical assistance to end the occupation of parts of Marawi City by fighters allied to the Islamic State group but had no boots on the ground.  There are some U.S. personnel who are operating equipment to provide information on situation awareness to our troops,  Brigadier General Restituto Padilla told a news conference.   I do not know the exact number and the specific mission. They are allowed to carry rifles for self-defense. But they are not allowed to fight, they only provide support,  he said. It was not clear how close to the battle zone the U.S. troops were. They were from a contingent of Special Forces based in the southern city of Zamboanga, the Philippines military has said previously. The U.S. embassy in Manila did not respond to a request for comment. In a statement similar to previous ones, the Pentagon said U.S. special operations forces are assisting the Philippines military in Marawi. A U.S. official in Washington, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the United States was providing a P-3 surveillance plane as well as intelligence gathering from a drone. That drone, however, crashed on Saturday after it lost communication links with its operator, the official said. On Wednesday, government forces attacked rebel positions in Marawi with bombs, tank fire and helicopter gunships, and plumes of smoke could be seen rising from the battered city. Some sniper shots could be heard. Fighting died down in the afternoon when heavy rain fell. It was the 23rd day of fighting in Marawi, and there was no sign that it would end any time soon.  There will be no more deadlines,  said Padilla, referring to a promise by the military to clear the city by June 12, the country's independence day.  It may take some time.  In Washington, a security official who is familiar with the region said the battle in Marawi appeared to be locked in a stalemate. An Armoured Personnel Carrier (APC) moves along a road at Amai Pakpak as government troops continue their assault against insurgents from the Maute group, who have taken over large parts of Marawi City, Philippines, June 13, 2017.Romeo Ranoco At the very least, it is not at all clear that government forces are presently winning or even gaining significant ground,  said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.  Islamic State demonstrated significant determination and success in capturing and holding Mosul in Iraq and their effort in Marawi is of a similar notable quality.  High-Rise Buildings The seizure of Marawi has alarmed Southeast Asian nations which fear Islamic State - which is on the back foot in Iraq and Syria - is trying to set up a stronghold on Mindanao island that could threaten their region. Reinforcement government troops march at Amai Pakpak as government troops continue their assault against insurgents from the Maute group, who have taken over large parts of Marawi City, Philippines, June 13, 2017.Romeo RanocoAnother Philippines military spokesman said troops had gained a significant advantage by taking control of eight high-rise building in the battle zone where the militants had set up snipers and machine-gun posts.  This is very important,  Colonel Edgard Arevalo told reporters.   We are in the final stage of our operation in Marawi. But we have to be very careful with our actions because there are still civilians in the area, they still have hostages and there are still people trapped in the firefight. The military said 290 people had been killed, including 206 militants, 58 soldiers and 26 civilians. About 100 militants are in the besieged area, the military has said. There are also an estimated 300 to 600 civilians trapped or being held hostage in the city. Islamic State's news agency, Amaq, said its fighters controlled two-thirds of the city. Responding to the report, Lieutenant General Carlito Galvez, head of military command in Western Mindanao, told Reuters the militants controlled 20 percent of the town.  The truth is probably somewhere in between,  said the U.S. security official. The Philippines has been fighting twin insurgencies from Maoist-led rebels and Muslim separatists in the south for nearly 50 years. Critics say military action is not enough to bring peace to a region that has long suffered from political neglect and poverty.

The original budget when Brazil won the right to host the Games in 2009 was around 28.8 billion reais. The total announced on Wednesday could still rise further, but it was in keeping with expectations that had been revised during the countdown to South America's first ever Olympics. The cost is below the 8.92 billion pounds ($14.3 billion) spent on London 2012, but still more than twice the $5.2 billion average cost of hosting the Summer Games, according to a 2015 study by the University of Oxford and Said Business School. Some 7.23 billion reais was spent on venues, AGLO said. The Globo sports website reported that the cost of infrastructure projects rose to 26.7 billion reais and another 9.2 billion reais was spent on operating costs. Rio de Janeiro, which hosted the Olympics in August and the Paralympics in September, has been criticized for a lack of legacy planning, with some of the venues abandoned soon after the closing ceremony. Other infrastructure projects, including a new metro line that does not extend all the way to the main Olympic Park, have had their effectiveness questioned. Officials said that legacy planning was a major challenge but that they intended to hold an average of three events a month at the Olympic venues starting this June, a number they hope will increase to 10 events a month by December.  It's not easy to manage the legacy,  AGLO president Paulo Marcio Dias Mello told reporters.  London, for example, took two years to deliver the legacy and even today there is public investment in that legacy.   Even if it doesn't meet everyone's expectations, it will be a relief that what we have here will not be white elephants.

The complaint said Trump had not sought congressional approval for any of the payments his hundreds of businesses had received from foreign governments since he took office in January, even though the Constitution requires him to do so. The White House did not respond to requests for comment but has said Trump's business interests do not violate the Constitution. The Trump Organization has said it will donate profits from customers representing foreign governments to the U.S. Treasury but will not require such customers to identify themselves. At least 30 U.S. senators and 166 representatives are plaintiffs in Wednesday's lawsuit, representing the largest number of legislators ever to sue a U.S. president, according to two lawmakers who are among the plaintiffs. It was the latest in a series of such lawsuits against the Republican president. The Constitution's  foreign emoluments  clause bars U.S. officeholders from accepting payments and various other gifts from foreign governments without congressional approval. The lawmakers are seeking a judicial order to require Trump to seek Congress' assent before he accepts such payments.  The presidentâs failure to tell us about these emoluments, to disclose the payments and benefits that he is receiving, mean that we cannot do our job. We cannot consent to what we donât know,  said Richard Blumenthal, the lead senator on the lawsuit, in a conference call on Tuesday. John Conyers, the lead plaintiff from the House of Representatives, added: âPresident Trump has conflicts of interest in at least 25 countries, and it appears heâs using his presidency to maximize his profits.  The Justice Department declined to comment. Similar lawsuits have been filed in recent months by parties including a nonprofit ethics group, a restaurant trade group, and the attorneys general of Maryland and the District of Columbia. They allege that Trump's acceptance of payments from foreign and U.S. governments through his hospitality empire puts other hotel and restaurant owners at an unfair disadvantage and provides governments an incentive to give Trump-owned businesses special treatment. Rare to Sue President In a motion to dismiss one such lawsuit on Friday, the Justice Department argued that the plaintiffs had not shown any specific harm to their businesses, and that Trump was only banned from receiving foreign government gifts if they arose from his service as president. On Monday, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said  partisan politics  was behind the lawsuit by the Maryland and District of Columbia officials. Lawmakers rarely sue the president, so there are few federal court decisions the legislators can cite to prove their legal standing to bring Wednesday's case, said Leah Litman, an assistant professor specializing in constitutional law at the University of California, Irvine. A 1997 Supreme Court decision by then-Chief Justice William Rehnquist indicates such cases have standing if the plaintiffs are numerous enough that they could have had a decisive impact on the vote from which they were excluded, said  Tara Grove, a professor specializing in federal courts and constitutional law at William & Mary Law School.  Courts are more and more receptive to the idea that a large group of federal lawmakers can sue over being deprived of their constitutionally conferred powers,  Grove said. Conyers and Blumenthal said they planned to reach out to their Republican colleagues in Congress to invite them to join the lawsuit.  I won't be surprised if a few do,  Conyers added.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-trump-lawsuit-idUSL1N1JB0E5"},

U.S. special forces have been based since last year at Tanf, a strategic Syrian highway border crossing with Iraq, where the Americans have assisted rebels trying to recapture territory from fleeing Islamic State fighters. The U.S.-backed Syrian rebels in the area are in competition with pro-government forces who are also trying to recapture territory from Islamic State. On several occasions in recent weeks, warplanes of the U.S.-led coalition have struck pro-government forces to prevent them advancing, in what Washington has described as self defense. Abu al-Atheer, military spokesman for the U.S.-backed Maghawir al-Thawra rebel group, told Reuters U.S. forces had spread from their initial location at Tanf to set up a second base at Zakf, around 60-70 km (40-50 miles) to the northeast. Regional intelligence sources told Reuters the U.S. military moved in the last few days a new long-range rocket launcher system from Jordan to Tanf, for the first time in southern Syria stepping up its presence in the area. They said the (High Mobility Artillery Rocket System) -  HIMARS which can fire missiles as far as 300km had been deployed for the first time in southern Syria. They had been previously used to strike militants from positions in Turkey and Jordan. Colonel Ryan Dillon, spokesman for the U.S.-led coalition fighting against Islamic State in both Iraq and Syria, denied troops had set up a new base. But he said sometimes coalition forces conduct patrols and training with rebels at locations outside Tanf that could be maintained for days or weeks.  We have that garrison in al-Tanf that is a temporary base and location for us to train our partner forces to fight to defeat ISIS, but that is the only base in southern Syria or location where we have coalition forces,  Dillon said.  Abu al-Atheer said the U.S. special forces were now patrolling distances of up to 100 km from Tanf. He said more U.S. special forces were arriving at both the original base at Tanf and the new base at Zakf, and more weapons had been delivered to rebels.  The (new) base was being studied for months but now it's an official base. It has been built and expanded and God willing will be in the next few days like the Tanf base,  he told Reuters. Video clips purportedly of the Zakf site, sent to Reuters by another rebel in the group, showed a convoy of military vehicles traveling on a paved road lined by long walls, a communications mast and a hut. Another showed three men in uniform next to two small military vehicles, firing a mortar in otherwise empty desert.

Hezbollah's Al Manar TV via Reuters TV/ File PhotoU.S.-backed rebels are fighting to oust Islamic State fighters from their last two major bastions - Mosul in Iraq and the Euphrates River valley near Raqqa in Syria - in battles which Washington hopes could crush the group this year. The Syrian government, backed by Russia and Iran, also wants to reclaim the territory in Syria. Pro-government forces have taken up positions north of Tanf, potentially cutting off the U.S.-backed rebels from advancing. Muzahem Saloum, a rebel official close to Maghawir al-Thawra, said the Zakf location would back up Tanf and was expected to be a  first line of defense  against any attack by Iranian-backed Syrian pro-government militias.

SANA/Handout viaFile PhotoTanf is located near a Syria-Iraq border crossing on the main Baghdad-Damascus highway, and the U.S.-backed rebels took it from Islamic State last year, partly to stop Iran from using it in future to send arms to the Syrian government.  The U.S.-backed rebels also want to use it to take more territory along the border and to push toward Deir al-Zor, a large city on the Euphrates where the government has an enclave surrounded by Islamic State fighters.  However, Syria's army has declared winning back control of the desert and relieving its besieged Deir al-Zor enclave a military priority and has advanced swiftly from Palmyra with troops and dozens of tanks.  Aided by allied militias backed by Iran, it also hopes to join up with Iraqi forces advancing against Islamic State across the border to secure a land route from Damascus to Baghdad.  Iranian news sites have published pictures of Qasem Soleimani, head of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards' elite extra-territorial arm the Qods Force, visiting militia fighters at an undisclosed area on the border.  Recent Syrian government advances to the Iraq border northeast of Tanf and Zakf mean the U.S.-backed rebels would have to fight the Syrian army in order to march on Deir al-Zor. U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis on Tuesday said air strikes against pro-government forces near Tanf in recent weeks had been in self defense, to prevent them from attacking its troops at the base. Rebel spokesman Abu al-Atheer said the goal of the government forces was  to cut our advance towards Deir al-Zor. But we are moving towards a plan to take us to Deir al-Zor even if they enter,  Abu al-Atheer said.  The battle is not over and we will not allow the Iranian Shi'ites to occupy our land. Our response to those who stand against us will be cruel,  he added.

EU officials have piled pressure on VW to compensate European customers after it admitted to U.S. regulators in September 2015 that it had cheated on emissions tests there using software installed in as many as 11 million diesel vehicles sold worldwide - the majority of them in Europe. Despite VW's admission of wrongdoing in the United States, it says it has not broken the law in Europe and sees no need to compensate consumers there. VW's chief executive Matthias Mueller told the EU's commissioner for consumer affairs earlier this week that the company would now offer European customers a two-year extended warranty, the Commission spokesman said. However, commenting on the talks with the commissioner, Vera Jourova, Volkswagen did not confirm that it had agreed to extend its guarantee. The company instead referred back to earlier  confidence-building measures  including a commitment to fix all vehicles affected by this autumn, saying that updating the software would not detract from the car's performance. People pass in front of a Volkswagen logo at Shanghai Auto Show during its media day, in Shanghai, China April 19, 2017.Aly Song Volkswagen has said all along that it cares for every customer,  it said in an email on Wednesday.  An extended warranty offer would be the first concession made by the company in response to mounting pressure from Brussels to do more for its diesel customers following months of talks with EU officials and more than a year after the Dieselgate scandal broke. Jourova and other EU regulators have repeatedly expressed frustration over VW's attitude to European customers in not offering the cash payouts granted to U.S. owners of its cars. But the European Union is limited in what it can do to pressure the company since the power to police the car industry currently lies with member states, which approve new car models that are then sold throughout the bloc. Unlike the United States, a patchwork of different legal rules across the Europe Union also weakens the chances of car owners successfully suing carmakers.

In the Detroit area, 114 Iraqi nationals were arrested over the weekend, and 85 throughout the rest of the country over the past several weeks, Gillian Christensen, a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokeswoman, said in a statement. The actions came as part of the Trump administration's push to increase immigration enforcement and make countries, which have resisted in the past, take back nationals ordered deported from the United States. The crackdown on Iraqi immigrants followed the U.S. government's decision to drop Iraq from a list of Muslim-majority nations targeted by a revised version of Trump's temporary travel ban issued in March. The overwhelming majority of those arrested had criminal convictions for crimes including murder, rape, assault, kidnapping, burglary, drug trafficking, weapons violations and other offenses, Christensen said. As of April 17, 2017, there were 1,444 Iraqi nationals with final orders for removal, she said. Since the March 12 agreement with Iraq regarding deportees, eight Iraqi nationals have been removed to Iraq. Dozens of Iraqi Chaldean Catholics in Detroit were among those targeted in the immigration sweeps, some of whom fear they will be killed if deported to their home country, immigration attorneys and family members said. âIt is very worrisome that ICE has signaled its intention to remove Chaldean Christians to Iraq where their safety not only cannot be guaranteed, but where they face persecution and death for their religious beliefs,â Martin Manna, president of the Chaldean Community Foundation, said in a statement on Wednesday. Kurdish Iraqis also were picked up in Nashville, Tennessee, attorneys, activists and family members said. At least some of those arrested came to the United States as children, got in trouble and already served their sentences, according to immigration attorneys and activists. Some have lived in the United States so long they no longer speak Arabic. An Iraqi official previously said Iraqi diplomatic and consular missions would coordinate with U.S. authorities to issue travel documents for the deportees.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-immigration-iraq-idUSL1N1JB2KA"},

The U.S. central bank raised its benchmark overnight rate to a range of 1.00 to 1.25 percent, its second quarter-point hike this year. Fed policy makers also signaled they were likely to raise rates once more this year, which helped lift yields on two-year notes, the most sensitive to Fed rate policy expectations, from their lows of the day. But the Fed's cautious outline of its plan for unwinding its $4.5 trillion bond portfolio, which it has used to keep long-term interest rates low to boost economic activity, did little to lift yields further out the yield curve. The Fed initially plans to trim its holdings of Treasuries and mortgage bonds by a combined $10 billion a month, seen as a very gradual pace. As a result, the Treasury yield curve flattened, with the spread between 2- and 10-year yields narrowing to less than 80 basis points, its tightest since early September. The big moves in the day came early, however. Government data on inflation and retail sales for May fell well short of market expectations. The core rate of inflation, which strips out food and energy costs, rose at just 1.7 percent year over year, the fourth straight monthly deceleration and the slowest pace overall in two years. Bond yields plunged by the most in a month following the data. While the Fed later stood by its conviction that the recent softening in inflation was not a long-term threat, long- and medium-dated yields remained not far from their lowest levels since November hit after the weak inflation data.  The market remains highly skeptical that the Fed is going to be able to deliver just based upon underlying data,  said Mark Cabana, head of U.S. short rates strategy at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in New York. U.S. 10-year yields were last at 2.127 percent after touching 2.103 percent earlier, their lowest since Nov. 10. U.S. 30-year yields were last at 2.769 percent after touching their lowest since Nov. 9 of 2.765 percent earlier. U.S. two-yields were last at 1.335 percent, down 3 basis points on the day.

The amendment appears intended to avoid the administration's legal case at the U.S. Supreme Court becoming moot on grounds that parts of the executive order have expired. Challengers to the ban, who say the order is intended to discriminate against Muslims, have said in court papers that it should expire on Wednesday, 90 days after the executive order was due to take effect on March 16. A memo issued by the White House, as the Supreme Court considered two challenges to the ban, said parts of the order put on hold would not expire before they can go into effect, and the start date would be when court injunctions were lifted. The move is part of administration efforts to have the high court rule that the controversial ban should immediately go into effect after Trump's first attempts to impose travel restrictions were blocked by lower courts. Omar Jadwat, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union, which has challenged the ban, said the need for the revision was a sign of the ban's legal flaws.  And yet again, these revisions underline that the one thing the president has consistently wanted throughout is a Muslim ban,  he added. Lawsuits by Hawaii and Maryland challengers argued that the order violated federal immigration law and a section of the Constitution's First Amendment, which prohibits the government favoring or disfavoring any particular religion. The Trump administration has said it is needed to protect national security. Soon after the memo was issued, Acting Solicitor General Jeff Wall filed court papers saying that it resolved  any doubt  about the order's effective date. If the case was moot, the nine justices would have no reason to rule on it and lower court rulings against the administration would remain in place. The Supreme Court on Tuesday gave the Trump administration more time to file papers responding to an appeals court ruling on Monday that upheld a block on the travel ban. The court's action likely delayed any decision on administration requests for the ban to go into effect until at least next week. Federal judges in Maryland and Hawaii blocked Trump's 90-day ban on travelers from Libya, Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The Hawaii judge also blocked a 120-day ban on refugees entering the United States. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals largely upheld the Hawaii injunction on Monday. In the second case, the Richmond, Virginia-based 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, on May 25 upheld the Maryland judge's ruling.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-court-immigration-idUSL1N1JB26V"},

Greater Omaha Packing Co said it shipped beef by plane to China from Nebraska, a top U.S. beef producing state, to meet strong demand.   They want it right away,  Chief Executive Officer Henry Davis said about Chinese consumers. Beijing banned U.S. beef imports in 2003 after a U.S. scare over mad cow disease, but last month agreed to allow U.S. shipments by mid July as part of a broader trade deal. Talks moved quickly, and U.S. officials said on Monday they had finalized requirements for exports.  China is the world's fastest growing beef market, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and its imports increased to $2.5 billion last year from $275 million in 2012. To win business, Greater Omaha Packing has hired bilingual salespeople from China, Davis said. He added that the company had received hundreds of phone calls in recent months about sales to China from potential customers and distributors. To make the first shipment, the company, which exports to other countries, affixed labels in English and Chinese on every box of beef on the flight, Davis said.  We'd never done Chinese before,  he said. So far, only Greater Omaha Packing and Tyson Foods Inc, the biggest U.S. meat company, have processing plants approved by the USDA to ship beef to China. Tyson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. On Tuesday, Cargill Inc [CARG.UL], another major beef processor, said that only a small percentage of the total current U.S. cattle supply would qualify for exports to China under the terms of the new trade agreement.  The deal requires U.S. producers to track the birthplace of cattle born in the United States that are destined for export to China and take other steps.  Some U.S. producers still view the market as lucrative, given China's expanding middle class.  The U.S. Meat Export Federation, a trade group, said this week that China's import requirements will add costs for producers.  However, CEO Philip Seng said  China holds exciting potential for the U.S. beef industry and for buyers in the market who have waited a very long time for the return of high-quality U.S. beef.

To make the first shipment, the company, which exports to other countries, affixed labels in English and Chinese on every box of beef on the flight, Davis said.  We'd never done Chinese before,  he said. So far, only Greater Omaha Packing and Tyson Foods Inc, the biggest U.S. meat company, have processing plants approved by the USDA to ship beef to China. Tyson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. On Tuesday, Cargill Inc [CARG.UL], another major beef processor, said that only a small percentage of the total current U.S. cattle supply would qualify for exports to China under the terms of the new trade agreement.  The deal requires U.S. producers to track the birthplace of cattle born in the United States that are destined for export to China and take other steps.  Some U.S. producers still view the market as lucrative, given China's expanding middle class.  The U.S. Meat Export Federation, a trade group, said this week that China's import requirements will add costs for producers.  However, CEO Philip Seng said  China holds exciting potential for the U.S. beef industry and for buyers in the market who have waited a very long time for the return of high-quality U.S. beef.

The Public Protector's office said in a statement on Wednesday it was investigating these allegations within Eskom, Transnet and The Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (PRASA). Allegations of government corruption have escalated this month after local media began reporting on more than 100,000 leaked emails they say show inappropriate interference by the wealthy Gupta family and ministers in the issuing of lucrative tenders.    The Public Protector South Africa, Advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane, has decided to conduct a preliminary investigation for the purpose of determining the merits of the several allegations published in the media,  the protector's office said. The latest allegations of influence-peddling are deepening a divide in the ANC as factions jostle for control before a conference in December where President Jacob Zuma's successor as party leader will be chosen. The investigation by the anti-corruption watchdog will focus on allegations of  improper or dishonest act  with respect to the public funds at Eskom, PRASA and Transnet and  unlawful enrichment  by certain public officials at the firms, it said. The investigation will also look at the re-appointment of Brian Molefe as chief executive of Eskom, the state power company, amid graft allegations. He was reinstated last month, but ministers then reversed his reinstatement.    Molefe has denied wrongdoing and the Gupta family, who are friends of Zuma, and its companies have also denied all allegations of influence-peddling or improper dealings. Most of the allegations form part of  The State Capture  report by the Public Protector, released last year on Nov. 2, focusing on allegations that businessmen brothers Ajay, Atul and Rajesh Gupta had influenced the appointment of ministers.  The report has been taken on judicial review by Zuma, mines minister Mosebenzi Zwane and Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs Desmond van Rooyen, the public protector said.

Politicians fear that a proliferation of such posts directed at the more than one million Muslim migrants who have entered Germany in the last two years might sway public opinion in the September election. Critics said the government was rushing through legislation that could damage free speech. The proposal known as the  Facebook Law  had not clearly defined what constituted a punishable offence, the Wissenschaftlicher Dienst said in a non-binding opinion.  The draft law doesn't specify guidelines, examples or reference points to define criminal or punishable content,  it said.  It would have been extremely useful to provide data as well as studies to help make a proper assessment of the danger posed by the dissemination of punishable hateful content and fake news and the assumed destructive effect they have.  Under the law, Facebook (FB.O), Twitter (TWTR.N) and Google-parent Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) would face up to 50 million euros ($56 million) in fines for not removing posts promptly. Martin Ott, Facebook's chief in Germany, told Handelsblatt newspaper in an interview published on Tuesday that the draft law was problematic because it shifted the legal responsibility from the courts to companies.  We don't think the law meets its aim as a private company should not decide what is legal or illegal,  he said.  This is the job of courts.  A justice ministry spokesman said the research body's reservations would be taken into consideration and any proposed amendments would be debated by parliamentary committees. The draft law would give social networks 24 hours to delete or block obviously criminal content and seven days to deal with less clear-cut cases, with an obligation to report back to the person who filed the complaint about how they handled the case.

Security Council.  Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Egypt and Bahrain on Friday branded 59 people, including Muslim Brotherhood spiritual leader Yousef al-Qaradawi, as terrorists and 12 entities, among them Qatari-funded charities Qatar Charity and Eid Charity, as having links to terrorism. The move came days after the four Arab states severed relations with Qatar, accusing it of supporting Islamist militants and their arch-adversary Iran, charges Qatar rejects. Several other countries followed suit. Turkey sent its foreign minister to Qatar on Wednesday as part of a drive to repair the rift with fellow Gulf Arab states. At least six of the people on the Arab states blacklist are already named on the U.N. Security Council al Qaeda and Islamic State sanctions list, which subjects them to a global asset freeze, travel ban and arms embargo. The U.N. Security Council has imposed sanctions on al Qaeda, Islamic State, the Taliban and related groups and people with ties to them. Iran is also subjected to a U.N. arms embargo. The Arab states would need to link people or entities on their blacklist to those U.N. sanctioned groups or to breaches of the Iran arms embargo if they wanted to propose that they be subjected to U.N. sanctions. For any names to be added to U.N. sanctions lists the Security Council can either agree by consensus behind closed doors or vote on a resolution, which would need nine votes in favor and no vetoes by the United States, Britain, France, Russia or China. Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry signaled on Wednesday that Cairo was eyeing U.N. action but did not specify if it would be Security Council or General Assembly action.   With regards to the United Nations, Egypt is moving forward without a doubt and I cannot clarify more than that,  he said.  But it will emerge within the coming days that there are impactful actions (being taken) and we will continue to use all of our resources to defend our national security,  he told Egypt's state news agency MENA. Last week Egypt called for the Security Council to launch an investigation into accusations that Qatar paid a ransom of up to $1 billion  to a terrorist group active in Iraq  to release kidnapped members of its royal family. Qatar denies the claim. The United Nations has said it is only bound by the U.N. Security Council sanctions lists and therefore any work with Qatar Charity was unaffected by the Arab states' blacklist.   The Qatar Charity implements projects included in the U.N.-coordinated Humanitarian Response Plans in Yemen, in Syria, and in Iraq, where they also participate in the common humanitarian coordination structure,  U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said.  He said the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs does  not provide funding for them and we do not receive funding from them.

The U.S. central bank's decision to revise a long-standing  policy normalization  plan came as somewhat of a surprise given a series of weak inflation readings risked delaying its march toward tighter policy. Its blueprint for halting current reinvestments by ever-larger increments of maturing Treasury- and mortgage-backed bonds came in at the low end of Wall Street estimates.  The Fed amassed the securities in three rounds of so-called quantitative easing, or QE, meant to stimulate U.S. investment and hiring in the wake of the 2007-2009 financial crisis and recession. The risk is that as the world's largest holder of Treasuries begins to edge back from the market, borrowing costs could shoot higher - though that has not yet happened. Policymakers, who also raised policy rates a notch as expected, did not specify when they would begin the bond trimming, though they are aiming for some time later this year.  We could put this into effect relatively soon,  Fed Chair Janet Yellen said at a press conference in Washington, a comment that caused longer-dated Treasury yields to rise from low levels earlier in the trading day.  As it stands, the central bank tops up any bonds that mature to keep its balance sheet steady at its record high level. According to the plan, the Fed would initially allow no more than $6 billion in Treasuries to run off per month, and will raise that  cap  each quarter by $6 billion over 12 months until it reaches $30 billion in maturing bonds per month. For mortgage bonds, the Fed would start with $4 billion per month and raise it in quarterly steps of $4 billion until it reaches a $20-billion monthly limit. Wall Street economists had been predicting the cap on Treasuries would fall roughly between $5-$15 billion per month, and on mortgage bonds $5-$10 billion, rising by increments of $5-$15 billion, according to research notes.  While the plan itself was seen as dovish, more aggressive was the fact the Fed wasted no time in laying it out.    This does seem like a more hawkish statement: the Fed announcing an update to their reinvestment principles leaves September open to the start of balance sheet runoff,  said Gennadiy Goldberg, interest rate strategist at TD Securities, in New York. Fed policy meetings in October and December were seen as alternative options to begin the process.  In response to the Fed's announcements, short-dated Treasury yields rose from earlier lows while longer-dated yields also rebounded. Mortgage-backed securities clung to earlier gains, with investors calling the plan modest.  It  is so mild and mechanical that it shouldn't be an issue for the longer-dated Treasury or MBS markets,  said Brian Jacobsen, chief portfolio strategist at Wells Fargo Funds Management in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin.  They stormed into the room with QE and are tiptoeing out almost unnoticed.  Yellen said the initial caps were set at  relatively low levels  to guard against possible sharp rises in market yields. The caps would remain in place until the portfolio shrinks to a to-be-determined level  appreciably  below $4.5 trillion, she said, adding that decision will hinge in part on what the Fed learns as it sheds bonds.  The central bank added that while its main tool for managing monetary policy will remain short-term interest rates, it would be prepared to halt its bond-reductions or even add more assets to its portfolio should there be a  material deterioration in the economic outlook.   Gene Tannuzzo, senior portfolio manager at Columbia Threadneedle, said future market volatility will probably force the Fed to adapt.  It all sounds fine now when (stocks) are at all time highs and credit spreads are tight and volatility is low,  he said.  But I'd be shocked if, in 2020, there haven't been some bumps along the way.

Now president of Qube Architecture LLC in Suwanee, Georgia, Park said in the lawsuit, filed in federal court in Manhattan, that One World Trade Center, which opened in November 2014, copies his 122-story  Cityfront '99,  whose cross-sections also feature narrow upright and inverted triangle shapes. Park, a naturalized U.S. citizen, said he registered Cityfront '99 with the U.S. Copyright Office on May 9. He is seeking unspecified damages, including for alleged harm to his architectural practice, plus credit for the design he said inspired One World Trade Center. Other defendants include entities controlled by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which developed the property, and building contractor Tishman Construction Co. Skidmore did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Spokesmen for the Port Authority and Tishman declined to comment. Park, who received an engineering degree in Seoul, said he created Cityfront '99 while getting his master's degree in architecture from the Illinois Institute of Technology. He said Skidmore had access to the design through an associate partner who was one of his thesis advisers, and through its display in the school's lobby. Park also said Cityfront '99 appeared in a scene from the 2006 movie  The Lake House,  starring Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock, which was filmed in the lobby of a Chicago building where Skidmore had an office.

Related CoverageTwo U.S. Navy vessels arrive in Doha for joint exercise -Qatar news agencyQatar signs $12 billion deal to buy F-15 jets from U.S.U.N. agency to assess airspace closure against Qatar, host talksConservative Gulf neighbors have long viewed Qatar's foreign policy with suspicion, especially its refusal to shun Shi'ite Iran, and resented Al Jazeera for its readiness to air unwelcome or dissenting views from across the region. The Gulf Arab states have not made public their demands of Qatar, but an Al Jazeera journalist shared on Twitter a list that includes Qatar severing diplomatic ties with Iran and expelling members of the Palestinian Islamist Hamas group and the Muslim Brotherhood who live in Doha. The list also includes ending support for  terrorist organizations  and ceasing  interference  in Egyptian affairs, charges that Qatar denies.  Quick Results  Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry told reporters in Cairo that the conditions set for Qatar were necessary for the national security of Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the UAE, the Egyptian state news agency MENA reported.  This move will bring concrete, quick and decisive results,  he said.  Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, trying to ease fears, told reporters in Berlin he does not expect a military conflict. French President Emmanuel Macron, visiting Morocco, called for de-escalation of tensions in the Gulf crisis. He said he would hold talks with leaders of Saudi Arabia, UAE and Qatar. Qatar has a population of 2.7 million people and vast gas wealth. The sanctions have disrupted imports of food and other materials and travel, and they have caused some foreign banks to scale back business. Before the diplomatic and commercial embargo, Qatar imported 80 percent of its food from bigger Gulf Arab neighbors. It has been talking to Iran and Turkey to obtain food and water. Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir, speaking after talks in Washington with U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Tuesday, said the sanctions did not amount to a blockade since Qatar's airports and ports remained open, and offered to send food and medical supplies to Qatar if needed. Qatar said the Saudi offer confirmed that the closure of transport links  is a siege, not a boycott. At Qatar's Hamad port on Wednesday, workers were busy unloading containers of food and building materials, while another ship carrying livestock, including chickens and sheep from Australia, was at the quayside.  There is a service from India ... which used to come via Jebel Ali port (in the United Arab Emirates) but is now redirected,  said a port official who declined to be named.  The first vessel on that service is to arrive Friday and will run once a week.  The effects of the dispute are rippling out beyond the region. Qatar said it had withdrawn troops from the frontier between the east African states of Djibouti and Eritrea, where it has been acting as mediator in a border dispute. It gave no reason, but Djibouti had earlier downgraded its diplomatic ties with Qatar.

The amendment appears intended to avoid the administration's legal case at the U.S. Supreme Court becoming moot on grounds that parts of the executive order have expired. Challengers to the ban, who say the order is intended to discriminate against Muslims, have said in court papers that it should expire on Wednesday, 90 days after the executive order was due to take effect on March 16. A memo issued by the White House, as the Supreme Court considered two challenges to the ban, said parts of the order put on hold would not expire before they can go into effect, and the start date would be when court injunctions were lifted. The move is part of administration efforts to have the high court rule that the controversial ban should immediately go into effect after Trump's first attempts to impose travel restrictions were blocked by lower courts.   Omar Jadwat, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union, which has challenged the ban, said the need for the revision was a sign of the ban's legal flaws.  And yet again, these revisions underline that the one thing the president has consistently wanted throughout is a Muslim ban,  he added. Lawsuits by Hawaii and Maryland challengers argued that the order violated federal immigration law and a section of the Constitution's First Amendment, which prohibits the government favoring or disfavoring any particular religion. The Trump administration has said it is needed to protect national security. Soon after the memo was issued, Acting Solicitor General Jeff Wall filed court papers saying that it resolved  any doubt  about the order's effective date.  If the case was moot, the nine justices would have no reason to rule on it and lower court rulings against the administration would remain in place. The Supreme Court on Tuesday gave the Trump administration more time to file papers responding to an appeals court ruling on Monday that upheld a block on the travel ban. The court's action likely delayed any decision on administration requests for the ban to go into effect until at least next week.  Federal judges in Maryland and Hawaii blocked Trump's 90-day ban on travelers from Libya, Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The Hawaii judge also blocked a 120-day ban on refugees entering the United States. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals largely upheld the Hawaii injunction on Monday. In the second case, the Richmond, Virginia-based 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, on May 25 upheld the Maryland judge's ruling.

Five of the officials, including Michigan Health and Human Services Director Nick Lyon, were charged with involuntary manslaughter stemming from their roles in handling the crisis, Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette said in a statement. Involuntary manslaughter is a felony that carries a sentence of up to 15 years in prison. Lyon, 49, was also charged with one count of misconduct in office. The felony charge carries a sentence of up to five years in prison. Four current and former state and Flint officials were also charged with involuntary manslaughter. The four had all been previously charged with lesser crimes in connection with the water crisis. The state's chief medical executive, Eden Wells, was charged Wednesday with obstruction of justice and lying to police. Michigan Governor Rick Snyder said in a statement that Lyon and Wells have his  full faith and confidence  and would remain on duty and help in Flint's recovery. An attorney for Lyon could not be reached for comment. It was not immediately known if Wells had an attorney. Schuette said his team had not spoken with Snyder as part of the investigation.  We attempted to interview the governor. We were not successful,  Schuette said. He declined to elaborate. Previously, Schuette, when asked if Snyder was a target in the investigation, said there were no targets but  nobody is off the table.  Some critics have called for high-ranking state officials, including Snyder, to be charged. Snyder previously said he believed he had not done anything criminally wrong.  The governor isn't going to speculate on where the investigation is or is not headed, but he continues to cooperate fully,  Snyder's spokeswoman Anna Heaton said. Snyder's attorney, Brian Lennon, said in a statement that Snyder was made available to testify under oath this spring after being told a subpoena would be produced, but that never occurred. He added that Snyder previously testified under oath to Congress. Wednesday's charges stem from more than 80 cases of Legionnaires' disease, including the fatalities, that were believed to be linked to the water in Flint after the city switched its source to the Flint River from Lake Huron in April 2014. Lyon was aware of the Legionnaires' outbreak in Genesee County at least one year before he informed the public, according to court documents. His deliberate failure to inform the public resulted in the death of Genesee Township resident Robert Skidmore, 85, from Legionnaires' in December 2015, the documents said. Wells lied to police about when she became aware of the outbreak, according to the documents. She also threatened a team of independent researchers who were studying the source of the disease, court documents said.  It's good to see that state Attorney General Schuette and his team are taking this matter seriously,  Flint Mayor Karen Weaver said in a statement.  We all are waiting to see what else the investigation uncovers.  The crisis in Flint erupted in 2015 when tests found high amounts of lead in blood samples taken from children in the predominantly black city of about 100,000. The more corrosive river water caused lead to leach from pipes and into the drinking water. Lead levels in Flint's drinking water have now fallen below levels considered dangerous by federal regulators, state officials said last January. Others charged with involuntary manslaughter on Wednesday included former state-appointed emergency manager Darnell Earley, former Flint city employee Howard Croft, and former state Department of Environmental Quality officials Stephen Busch and Liane Shekter-Smith.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/michigan-water-idUSL1N1JB1DN"},

The Securities and Exchange Commission is said to be taking a hard look at the increased use of such offerings, with the growth of so-called ICOs surging in recent months. The overall value of the coin market is estimated at over $90 billion, and the frenzied activity has fueled a record-breaking rise in the price of bitcoin, which hit an all-time high of $2,911.86 this week, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI)[here]. ICOs have become mired in an ongoing industry debate, with critics likening the phenomenon to the dotcom bubble in the 1990s, while proponents say the use of such coins and offerings facilitates the type of innovation that could radically transform existing business processes and industries. How Do Ico's Work? A simplistic interpretation of the issuance of such coins, or tokens, is that they are an investment on a possible future payoff. For example, if a startup technology firm has a business plan to apply blockchain for a certain solution, say, improve the back-end of securities or payment processing, or enhance record keeping in the insurance sector, investors would purchase the tokens before such a solution is actually realized or operational. The ventures could receive the tokens for payment in future development of their business. The tokens do not in themselves confer ownership of a stake in the business. Depending on how the deal is structured, the investment in the tokens might lead to a future share in revenues of the venture. In other cases, the investment can be compared to fund-raising or a crowd-funding vehicle, using tokens that could be redeemed for cash at a later date once the venture is successful. Since the issuance of such tokens is currently outside the scope of regulatory oversight, they are seen as a quick way in which tech startups can raise capital without all of the necessary requirements that would come with, say, an initial public offering in stocks. But what seems to be fueling a lot of the recent flows into such tokens is their speculative potential, and the ability to take the tokens and exchange them for cash on many of the worldâs crypto-currency exchanges. If the coin is listed on an exchange after its initial offering, then the likelihood that its value increases grows considerably, say some observers.  However, not all ICOs are created equally. Due to the complexity of the underlying projects, experts argue that investors need to have the technical expertise to be able to evaluate whether investing in an ICO makes sense. Moreover, the startup itself should provide sufficient information for investors to evaluate the investment. In some cases, the information is inadequate. âLots of good things have come out of the relative flexibility of ICOs and to raise capital efficiently from a community that understands the process,â Ajit Tripathi, director of fintech and digital banking at PwC, recently told Regulatory Intelligence. âOverall, itâs a very interesting model in raising capital, but the relative lack of transparency is a concern,â he added. âSome tokens have no disclosure or underlying prospectusâ¦.the overall lack of transparency is the main issue.â When Is a Token a Security? From a regulatory and legal perspective what remains contentious is whether the issuance of such coins are the equivalent to the creation of a new security, and should therefore come under the oversight and regulation of the SEC.  Peter Van Valkenburgh, director of research at crypto-currency advocacy group Coin Center, told a recent New York conference that what participants in the market want to avoid is the creation of a token that acts as a security.  It's like painting a target on yourself. Because, what does an organization like the SEC regulate? They regulate IPOs,â Van Valkenburgh told a panel on the legality of ICOs.  âThat's what they regulate. So, let's just change one letter and make it a 'C' and then it's OK, right? No. Why would you adopt the terminology of the regulator when youâre building a thing you hope they don't regulate?  he asked. The SECâs view on the issuance of such tokens is less than clear given the lack of public comment to date. But industry experts say they are aware that the issue is being actively explored. âI know that this is something thatâs high on their radar,â said a U.S. regulator who requested anonymity.  What might be a guide to the SECâs thinking is its recent decision to block the listing of the first U.S. exchange-traded fund tracking bitcoin. A more-than-three-year effort by investors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss to convince the SEC to allow it to bring the Bitcoin ETF to market stalled when the agency's staff ruled against them in March. The agency has since said it will review its prior decision (here). Sec Winklevoss Decision a Clear Signal Tripathi of PwC says the SEC decision shows the agency recognizes the benefits of the ICO marketplace, but is also concerned by the lack of oversight and transparency from the exchanges on which the coins are traded. âThese exchanges where tokens are traded are not exactly transparent or have the right regulatory structure or supervision,â said Tripathi. âItâs very easy for participants to manipulate pricesâ¦which the SEC highlighted in its opinion on Winklevoss.â Specifically, the commission said it did not find the proposal to be consistent with the Securities Exchange Act, which requires âamong other things, that the rules of a national securities exchange be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices and to protect investors and the public interest.â In order to address the agencyâs concerns, two things [here] were needed. âFirst, the exchange must have surveillance-sharing agreements with significant markets for trading the underlying commodity or derivatives on that commodity. And second, those markets must be regulated,â the commission said. Whether the ICO sector, populated with numerous companies, small and large, who see their unfettered status as innovators a large part of their mission and appeal, can organize themselves to meet such requirements is very much in question at the moment.

Stefan Lumiere, 46, was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan federal court, according to federal prosecutors. Prosecutors had said in a brief filed in court that they believed a sentence of up to 14 years would be appropriate, while Lumiere's lawyers argued for a lighter sentence.  We are pleased that our arguments resonated with the court,  Lumiere's lawyers, Jonathan Halpern and Jon Friedman, said in a statement. They said Lumiere would appeal his conviction. Lumiere, whose sister was married to Visium founder Jacob Gottlieb when he worked at the hedge fund, was found guilty of conspiracy, securities fraud and wire fraud charges in January after a six-day trial. The trial followed a investigation of Visium that prompted the $8 billion firm's wind-down and charges against three others, including Sanjay Valvani, a portfolio manager who committed suicide in June after being accused of insider trading. Prosecutors said Lumiere and others conspired from 2011 to 2013 to mismark the value of securities held by a bond fund, which invested in debt issued by healthcare companies and which in 2012 reported peak net assets of $471.5 million. Lumiere and others rigged the process of valuing the Visium Credit Opportunities Fund's distressed-debt holdings by, among other things, obtaining sham quotes from brokers, who gave them the inflated values they wanted, prosecutors said.

Jeehoon Park accused Skidmore, Owings & Merrill of falsely claiming design credit for the 104-story One World Trade Center, whose 1,776-foot (541 m) height including the spire makes it the Western Hemisphere's tallest building. Now president of Qube Architecture LLC in Suwanee, Georgia, Park said in the lawsuit, filed in federal court in Manhattan, that One World Trade Center, which opened in November 2014, copies his 122-story  Cityfront '99,  whose cross-sections also feature narrow upright and inverted triangle shapes. Park, a naturalized U.S. citizen, said he registered Cityfront '99 with the U.S. Copyright Office on May 9. He is seeking unspecified damages, including for alleged harm to his architectural practice, plus credit for the design he said inspired One World Trade Center. Other defendants include entities controlled by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which developed the property, and building contractor Tishman Construction Co.

Bouteflika, who has rarely been seen in public since suffering a stroke in 2013, appeared on state television briefly presiding over a cabinet meeting with the new government put in place last month after legislative elections. Energy earnings of North African OPEC member Algeria have collapsed with the sharp fall in global crude prices, and the country has started austerity reforms to offset falling revenues from energy sales, which account for 60 percent of its budget. Analysts say that how to balance reforms and maintain the social peace is still a key debate for the leadership in Algeria, where past unrest and a 1990s war with armed Islamists left many people wary of instability. In a statement from the presidency, Bouteflika urged the newly appointed government to enact budget cuts in a 2017 law but avoid foreign loans, suggesting instead  unconventional  internal funding. He also called for reforms in the country's banking system and improvement in the investment climate. Bouteflika called for more renewable energy and  unconventional fossil hydrocarbons,  one of his first references to Algeria's shale energy potential. The government in the past said it would not focus on those reserves after protests over environment concerns in the Sahara. Algeria has struggled with a more than 50 percent fall in the revenue of its oil and gas exports, which account for 94 percent of total sales abroad and 60 percent of the state budget. The decline has forced the government to cut spending for this year by 14 percent after a 9 percent reduction in 2016. Authorities also increased prices of subsidised products including electricity, gasoline and diesel for the first time in years, while restricting imports, which will decline in 2017 by $15 billion from last year's $46 billion, according to Prime Minister Abdelmadjid Tebboune. Bouteflika said the government should be committed to Algeria's social welfare policy, but called for rationalisation and better targeting of spending that subsidises everything from food to medicine, housing and education. Tebboune, a former housing minister, took over as prime minister last month in a cabinet reshuffle that saw the appointment of new energy and finance ministers. Bouteflika, now 80 and in power for nearly two decades, was seen in public for the first time in months when he voted in the May election from his wheelchair. His absences have left questions over his health and political jockeying before any potential transition before his term ends in 2019.

The U.S. central bank's decision to revise a long-standing  policy normalization  plan came as somewhat of a surprise given a series of weak inflation readings risked delaying its march toward tighter policy. Its blueprint for halting current reinvestments by ever-larger increments of maturing Treasury- and mortgage-backed bonds came in at the low end of Wall Street estimates. The Fed amassed the securities in three rounds of so-called quantitative easing, or QE, meant to stimulate U.S. investment and hiring in the wake of the 2007-2009 financial crisis and recession. The risk is that as the world's largest holder of Treasuries begins to edge back from the market, borrowing costs could shoot higher - though that has not yet happened. Policymakers, who also raised policy rates a notch as expected, did not specify when they would begin the bond trimming, though they are aiming for some time later this year.  We could put this into effect relatively soon,  Fed Chair Janet Yellen said at a press conference in Washington, a comment that caused longer-dated Treasury yields to rise from low levels earlier in the trading day. As it stands, the central bank tops up any bonds that mature to keep its balance sheet steady at its record high level. According to the plan, the Fed would initially allow no more than $6 billion in Treasuries to run off per month, and will raise that  cap  each quarter by $6 billion over 12 months until it reaches $30 billion in maturing bonds per month. For mortgage bonds, the Fed would start with $4 billion per month and raise it in quarterly steps of $4 billion until it reaches a $20-billion monthly limit. Wall Street economists had been predicting the cap on Treasuries would fall roughly between $5-$15 billion per month, and on mortgage bonds $5-$10 billion, rising by increments of $5-$15 billion, according to research notes. While the plan itself was seen as dovish, more aggressive was the fact the Fed wasted no time in laying it out.  This does seem like a more hawkish statement: the Fed announcing an update to their reinvestment principles leaves September open to the start of balance sheet runoff,  said Gennadiy Goldberg, interest rate strategist at TD Securities, in New York. Fed policy meetings in October and December were seen as alternative options to begin the process. In response to the Fed's announcements, short-dated Treasury yields rose from earlier lows while longer-dated yields also rebounded. Mortgage-backed securities clung to earlier gains, with investors calling the plan modest. It  is so mild and mechanical that it shouldn't be an issue for the longer-dated Treasury or MBS markets,  said Brian Jacobsen, chief portfolio strategist at Wells Fargo Funds Management in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin.  They stormed into the room with QE and are tiptoeing out almost unnoticed.  Yellen said the initial caps were set at  relatively low levels  to guard against possible sharp rises in market yields. The caps would remain in place until the portfolio shrinks to a to-be-determined level  appreciably  below $4.5 trillion, she said, adding that decision will hinge in part on what the Fed learns as it sheds bonds. The central bank added that while its main tool for managing monetary policy will remain short-term interest rates, it would be prepared to halt its bond-reductions or even add more assets to its portfolio should there be a  material deterioration in the economic outlook.  Gene Tannuzzo, senior portfolio manager at Columbia Threadneedle, said future market volatility will probably force the Fed to adapt.  It all sounds fine now when (stocks) are at all time highs and credit spreads are tight and volatility is low,  he said.  But I'd be shocked if, in 2020, there haven't been some bumps along the way.

The PSD completed a performance review of Grindeanu's six-month old cabinet on Wednesday evening and found it had failed to uphold an ambitious governing program that had won the party a sweeping election victory in December and a comfortable parliament majority. PSD leader Liviu Dragnea, who holds tight control over his party, said all cabinet ministers have filed their resignations and that his party was ready to nominate another premier and government together with junior coalition partner ALDE.  I think it is important that this country benefit from this governing program that Romanians massively voted for,  he told reporters. But Prime Minister Grindeanu said the review was a surprise and showed his cabinet had failed to enforce measures which had deadlines of 2018 or later, as well as some that could not be implemented, such as bolstering economic relations with Russia, which would be difficult given sanctions imposed by the EU.  I have tried to understand why ... there is such fury in getting rid of your own government after not even six months,  Grindeanu told reporters.  I don't see another answer other than ... one man's desire of holding all the power.  He said he would only resign after center-right President Klaus Iohannis held consultations with parliamentary parties and indicated he would appoint a replacement from the PSD.  I want PSD to stay in government,  Grindeanu said.  I don't want to risk it. At this moment all options are open.   With Grindeanu's refusal to resign, the ruling coalition must file a no-confidence vote in parliament to topple the prime minister and consequently nominate a replacement.  Under Romanian law, the president must endorse a premier after consultations with political parties. The appointee then needs to secure a vote of confidence from parliament, where PSD and ALDE control a comfortable majority. Either way, there would be more delays in policymaking in the EU's second-poorest state, which has massive healthcare and transport infrastructure needs. Sergiu Miscoiu, a political science professor at Babes-Bolyai University, said there would be  no gain here for the Social Democrats - the party will see a huge loss of image, or what was left of it.  The PSD's great advantage was unity and its capacity to mobilize, vertical decisions and discipline. These myths are gone now. To the extent that Grindeanu will resign, he will throw the ball into President [Klaus] Iohannis's court, who could appoint a technocrat,  Miscoiu said.  Romania was the EU's fastest-growing economy in the first quarter, expanding by 5.7 percent, and its budget ran a small surplus at the end of April. The legacy of Grindeanu's government also includes a failed attempt at the start of the year to decriminalize several corruption offences, a move foiled by the largest street protests in Romania since the 1989 fall of its communist regime.

In May, the Justice Department sued Fiat Chrysler, accusing the Italian-American automaker of illegally using software to bypass emission controls in 104,000 diesel vehicles sold since 2014. Fiat Chrysler lawyer Robert Giuffra said the company is optimistic regulators will approve the company's proposed software update as part of certifying 2017 diesel models to allow them to go on sale and then use that software to update the 104,000 vehicles on the road. Leigh Rende, a Justice Department lawyer, said at a San Francisco federal court hearing  there is uncertainty  about whether the fix will be approved.  It could be weeks or months away,  Rende said of a decision.  This is really a technical decision.  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and California Air Resources Board accused Fiat Chrysler in January of using undisclosed software to allow excess diesel emissions in 104,000 U.S. 2014-2016 Jeep Grand Cherokees and Dodge Ram 1500 trucks in a notice of violation in January. Fiat Chrysler has said it does not believe the software update would impact performance or fuel efficiency and has held six meetings and calls with regulators in the last three weeks. Company shares trading in New York (FCAU.N) fell 1 percent to $10.89 on Wednesday. The January notice was the result of a probe that arose out of regulators' investigation of rival Volkswagen AG's (VOWG_p.DE) excess emissions. Fiat Chrysler faces more than 20 lawsuits from dealers and owners over the alleged excess emissions. U.S. District Judge Edward Chen is also overseeing suits filed against Robert Bosch GmbH [ROBG.UL] stemming from its role in developing the Fiat Chrysler diesel engines. At Wednesday's hearing, lawyers representing owners said they plan to review millions of pages of documents and urged a speedy trial date if no settlement is reached. Reuters reported in May that the Justice Department and the EPA have obtained internal emails and other documents written in Italian that look at engine development and emissions issues that raise significant questions. In total, VW has agreed to spend more than $25 billion in the United States to address claims from owners, environmental regulators, states and dealers and offered to buy back about 500,000 polluting U.S. vehicles.

The energy group fell 3.9 percent as oil prices moved lower by a similar degree, hit by an unexpected large buildup in gasoline inventories and an international outlook that suggests a big increase in supply in the coming year.

Complaints rose to 1,909 in April, the U.S. Department of Transportation reported, as consumer anger at airlines boiled over following video showing David Dao being violently removed from a United flight on April 9 to make room for crew members. This and other airline incidents caught on mobile phone videos have been widely broadcast on social media, prompting congressional hearings with airline executives that raised questions about customer service and airline cost-cutting. Congress may take up the issue of airplane passenger rights when it considers a bill to reauthorize the Federal Aviation Administration.  If airlines donât get their act together, we are going to act, it is going to be one size fits all,â said Bill Shuster, chairman of the House of Representativesâ transportation committee at a hearing in May.  Seize this opportunity because if you donât, weâre going to come, and youâre not going to like it.  Southwest Airlines Co said in April it would end overbooking, while United announced policy changes, including boosting compensation for overbooked passengers to up to $10,000. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao told Congress last week that the department had created a website to highlight passenger protections but she had not endorsed any new legal protections for airline passengers. Chao said it was in airlines'  best interest to treat passengers with respect.  The Transportation Department also said Wednesday in a statement that carriers canceled 1.6 percent of scheduled domestic flights in April, up from 0.9 percent in the same month last year. American Airlines Group Inc said Tuesday it would reduce leg room by one inch instead of two as originally planned on some seats in its Boeing 737 MAX jets, acknowledging customer concerns. In May, American said it would shrink the distance between some seat backs, or pitch, on its new Boeing Co 737 MAX jets from the minimum of 31 inches on its current 737-800 fleet, to 29 inches. The company said  airline customers feel increasingly frustrated by their experiences and less valued when they fly. We can be leaders in helping to turn around that perception.

Jeehoon Park accused Skidmore, Owings & Merrill of falsely claiming design credit for the 104-story One World Trade Center, whose 1,776-foot (541 m) height including the spire makes it the Western Hemisphere's tallest building. Now president of Qube Architecture LLC in Suwanee, Georgia, Park said in the lawsuit, filed in federal court in Manhattan, that One World Trade Center, which opened in November 2014, copies his 122-story  Cityfront '99,  whose cross-sections also feature narrow upright and inverted triangle shapes. Park, a naturalized U.S. citizen, said he registered Cityfront '99 with the U.S. Copyright Office on May 9. He is seeking unspecified damages, including for alleged harm to his architectural practice, plus credit for the design he said inspired One World Trade Center. Other defendants include entities controlled by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which developed the property, and building contractor Tishman Construction Co.

Spokesmen for the Port Authority and Tishman declined to comment.

FILE PHOTO: One World Trade Center reflects the setting sun in New York, U.S., February 14, 2017.Lucas JacksonHe said Skidmore had access to the design through an associate partner who was one of his thesis advisers, and through its display in the school's lobby. Park also said Cityfront '99 appeared in a scene from the 2006 movie  The Lake House,  starring Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock, which was filmed in the lobby of a Chicago building where Skidmore had an office.  He just wants to be treated fairly,  Dan Kent, a lawyer for Park, said.  Our client frankly didn't know what his legal rights were until he came to us,  Kent added.

Kalanick's move comes after a months-long investigation led former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, who was hired by Uber to look into its culture and workplace practices after a female former employee publicly accused the company of what she described as brazen sexual harassment. Uber on Tuesday released the recommendations from that report, which include reducing Kalanick's sweeping authority and instituting more controls over spending, human resources and the behavior of managers. (bit.ly/2rX2xA5) Kalanick's departure, even if it is temporary, is a thunderclap for the Silicon Valley startup world, where company founders in recent years have enjoyed great autonomy and often become synonymous with their firms. It also marks a pivotal moment for the world's most valuable venture-backed private company, which has been largely defined by Kalanick's brash approach. Kalanick, 40, said he needed the time away to grieve for his recently deceased mother and to work on his leadership skills, according to a staff email seen by Reuters. He did not say how long he would be away.  If we are going to work on Uber 2.0, I also need to work on Travis 2.0 to become the leader that this company needs and that you deserve,  Kalanick wrote in his email.  During this interim period, the leadership team, my directs, will be running the company.  According to a source familiar with the matter, Kalanick can return to the company whenever he would like. More Oversight Needed The company on Tuesday shared with its staff 47 recommendations for management and policy changes that were unanimously adopted by the board on Sunday. Kalanick was not at the meeting, said a source who was present. The meeting was marred by private equity executive David Bonderman making a sexist remark about women talking too much. He later resigned from the board of directors, calling his comment  careless, inappropriate, and inexcusable.  The recommendations from Holder's firm, Covington and Burling, include adding an independent director to the board and considering an independent chair; mandated manager training; and a bigger and more independent audit committee to oversee spending and management.  I would now suggest to any startup, here are the Covington rules, and when you get passed 100 people, put these in place,  said Steve Blank, a startup founder and mentor and adjunct professor at Stanford University. Other recommendations prohibit romances between bosses and their subordinates and create clearer guidelines on the use of drugs and alcohol.  I think it paints a picture of a company pretty out of control with no oversight from the board or basic controls,  said Elizabeth Ames, senior vice president at the Anita Borg Institute, which advocates for women in technology. At Tuesday's employee meeting, human resources chief Liane Hornsey thanked the former employee who wrote about harassment, Susan Fowler, for being a catalyst for the changes. She received applause from employees, according to the source at the meeting. Holder's recommendations stressed the importance of a new chief operating officer. The company has been searching for a No.2 executive for more than three months and is also looking for a chief financial officer. A number of senior Uber managers left in recent weeks as the Holder investigation and a parallel probe focused strictly on sexual harassment and other employee complaints, conducted by the law firm Perkins Coie, moved forward. The most recent departing executives included Emil Michael, head of business and Kalanick's closest confidant, and Eric Alexander, who ran the Asia Pacific region. Uber said last week it had hired two women to fill top roles: Harvard Business School management professor Frances Frei will serve as an executive coach and Apple Inc marketing executive Bozoma Saint John was hired to mend Uber's brand. Uber also added a second woman to its board, Wan Ling Martello, an executive vice president at Nestle, to serve as an independent director. There are 14 people at Uber who report directly to Kalanick and who will likely take on more responsibility in his absence. They include Ryan Graves, head of operations and one-time chief executive at Uber. Founder Power Uber grew to a valuation of $68 billion in seven years amid non-stop controversy. It has upended the tightly regulated taxi industry in many countries and changed the transportation landscape, but has run into legal trouble with a rough-and-tumble approach to local regulations and the way it handles employees and drivers. Uber has suffered a series of damaging setbacks in recent months, including a federal probe into the company's use of technology to evade regulators in certain cities and a trade secrets lawsuit filed by Alphabet Inc's self-driving unit, Waymo. Some venture capitalists say Uber's challenges should serve as a warning that the Silicon Valley ethos of leaving founders in control of companies, even after they grow into big corporations, can be a dangerous proposition.  Inevitably, this will help drive the pendulum back toward better governance inside an organization,  said Robert Siegel, a lecturer at Stanford University and venture capitalist at XSeed Capital.  Sometimes we conflate great business leaders with strong personalities with great governance. ","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/uber-board-idUSL1N1JA1DK"},

The loonie has soared this week after the Bank of Canada signaled higher interest rates ahead.     Investors have moved forward their expectations for when the central bank will begin raising rates, said Hosen Marjaee, senior managing director, Canadian fixed income at Manulife Asset Management.         Chances of a rate hike this year have surged to 87 percent from less than one-in-four before stronger-than-expected jobs data on Friday.                Canadian household debt as a share of income dipped to 166.9 percent in the first quarter but remained near record highs, while separate domestic data showed that home prices rose in May.                              Canada's central bank, which had long said interest rates are too blunt a tool to tackle the country's housing market, may have finally decided to act and at least limit its role in fueling a potential bubble with low interest rates.                  The U.S. dollar        had been pressured by weaker-than-expected economic data but reversed most of its losses against a basket of major currencies after the Fed raised rates and said it was prepared to continue tightening monetary policy.                  Crude oil prices slumped to their lowest close in seven months on Wednesday, hit by an unexpected large build in gasoline inventories. U.S. crude oil futures        settled $1.73 lower at $44.73 a barrel.               At 4 p.m. EDT (2000 GMT), the Canadian dollar          was trading at C$1.3234 to the greenback, or 75.56 U.S. cents, up 0.1 percent.     The currency's weakest level of the session was C$1.3271, while it touched its strongest since Feb. 28 at C$1.3165.         Canadian government bond prices were higher across the yield curve in sympathy with U.S. Treasuries. The two-year            rose 4 Canadian cents to yield 0.887 percent and the 10-year             climbed 51 Canadian cents to yield 1.505 percent.     The gap between the 10-year yield and its U.S. equivalent narrowed by 0.9 of a basis points to a spread of -63.7 basis points, its smallest since Nov. 8, the day of the U.S. election.     Spreads between Canada and the U.S. could narrow further as Canada's economy builds momentum in the first half of the year and as the U.S. economy shows some signs of slowing, Marjaee said.  Our portfolio strategy is to benefit from that.

The 47 patients in the study were suffering from HIV-associated facial lipoatrophy, an abnormal loss of fat from the face that gives people a gaunt, sunken-face appearance. It can be caused by the raft of antiviral medicines used by HIV patients to keep the virus in check. Renevia is a hydrogel polymer that is mixed with precursor cells derived from fat elsewhere in the body, providing the cellular structure that allows them to graft and survive in a new location in the face. Treated patients had about 5 cc of Renevia injected into each side of the face and were measured for facial volume after six months. At six months, those who received Renevia on average had 5.1 cc of the new hemifacial volume, representing 100 percent retention of the transplanted material, compared with no new facial volume in untreated patients. The results were deemed to be statistically significant.  The retention of the transfer volume after six months in patients is quite impressive and we look forward to evaluating the 12-month data,  Dr Ramon Llull, the study's primary investigator, said in a statement. There were no serious side effects associated with Renevia treatment reported in the trial, BioTime said. About 350,000 HIV patients in Europe suffer from significant facial lipoatrophy, the company said. With this data in hand, BioTime plans to discuss requirements for U.S. trials with the Food and Drug Administration. Once the company secures approvals for the HIV-related condition, it plans to go after the far larger and lucrative facial aesthetics market, Co-Chief Executive Adi Mohanty said. In that market, it would be aimed at and used by plastic surgeons, a cash business that does not rely on reimbursements from insurers, much like Allergan Plc's hugely successful Botox. Dermal fillers and other widely used fat transplant methods tend to lose volume far more quickly that what has been demonstrated by Renevia, Mohanty explained. And if Renevia works using cells compromised by the effects of HIV medications, the company believes even better results are possible with healthy subjects.  If those cells are still attaching and grafting and surviving, then healthier cells should have no trouble,  Mohanty said.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/biotime-study-idUSL1N1JB2D5"},

Based on questionnaires answered by more than 16,000 never-smokers in Sweden, researchers found that snus users were over 50 percent more likely than non-users to have asthma. In addition, snus users were 37 to 59 percent more likely to snore and have trouble falling asleep, the study found.  Snus, which was developed in Sweden, usually comes in a small pouch and users tuck a pinch of it between the gums and upper lip.  âSnus is used by a large proportion of especially young and middle-aged men in Sweden,â said senior study author Dr. Christer Janson of the University of Uppsala. âThere are some studies showing association between the use of snus and heart disease but to my knowledge no studies on the possible effects of snus on the respiratory system,â Janson said by email. Janson said someone on his staff told him her husbandâs asthma had improved when he stopped using snus. âThen a young Icelandic doctor, Arna Yr Gudnadottir, contacted me and wanted to do some research here in Uppsala,â he said. Gudnadottir, Janson, and their colleagues examined data taken from a questionnaire that was mailed to 45,000 randomly selected Swedish residents as part of the Global Allergy and Asthma European Network survey in 2008.  Nearly 27,000 people, ranging in age from 16 to 75, responded. They lived in one of four Swedish cities: Uppsala, Stockholm, Ume or Gothenburg. Of this entire study group, 16,082 people were never-smokers and roughly 18 percent of men and 5 percent of women used snus. Overall, younger people were more likely to be dual users of snus and smoked tobacco, while older people were more likely to smoke than to use snus, according to the report in BMJ Open. All in all, participants who reported having any respiratory symptoms were more likely to be smokers and dual users of cigarettes and snus. However, snus users were more likely to suffer from wheezing and night-time chest tightness, chronic bronchitis, and chronic nose and sinus problems, when compared with participants who were completely tobacco-free.  The study team also found that people who reported having asthma were more likely to be current snus users and the same link wasnât seen among past snus users, dual users or people who only smoked.   âMy guess is that the finding between a higher risk of asthma in snus users is related to inflammation in the upper part of the airways. This inflammation can then expand to the lower parts of the airways and thereby cause asthma,â Janson said. The theory is supported by the fact that rhinitis, or inflammation in the nose, increases the risk of developing asthma, Janson said. The researchers acknowledge that these associations donât prove that snus cause asthma.  âWe will start a follow-up study of this population next year. We can then get more precise information on what happens to participants that start or quit using snus,â Janson said. The study reports some novel findings, and the sample is quite impressive, said Lucy Popova, of the Georgia State University School of Public Health in Atlanta who was not involved in the research. However, she added, âAs the authors themselves acknowledge, it could be that snus causes asthma and other problems, or it could be that people with asthma are more likely to use snus than smoke (or to not use snus).â Popova noted that less than 1 percent of U.S. adults use snus every day or some days and that Swedish snus is less harmful than the traditional smokeless tobacco (moist snuff, also called chew or dip) sold in the U.S. âSwedish snus has a lower concentration of cancer-causing chemicals called âtobacco-specific nitrosaminesâ or TSNAs that naturally occur in tobacco plants and increase during the fermentation of tobacco leaves, Popova said by email. âWhile snus is not risk-free, if used exclusively, snus is safer than smoking,â she said.

The shareholder vote shows how investors, even in an uncontested board election, are increasingly voicing their frustration with board members on matters related to executive and director pay. Chairman David D'Alessandro received more  withhold  votes than  for  votes at the annual meeting on Wednesday, a proxy voting result that means shareholders effectively voted him off the board, according to people familiar with the matter, who did not want to be named because the vote tally is not yet final. The result means that D'Alessandro is required to offer his resignation, according to company bylaws. The board must then disclose within 90 days what its intentions are in relation to the offer.  The board will continue to proceed in the best interest of shareholders following this yearâs annual meeting,  Orlando, Florida-based SeaWorld said in a statement to Reuters. SeaWorld announced in March that China's Zhonghong Zhuoye Group Co Ltd agreed to buy Blackstone Group's 21 percent stake in the theme park operator for $23 per share, or $429 million. The following month, SeaWorld disclosed in a securities filing that in connection with the sale, it would be paying out special bonuses to certain employees that dated to SeaWorld's 2013 IPO. The original agreement granted D'Alessandro, ex-CEO Jim Atchison and about 60 key employees a chunk of restricted shares to be paid out if SeaWorld achieved certain goals, including an investment return multiple of 2.75 times Blackstone's invested capital. Based on the price Zhonghong paid, the achieved multiple fell just shy of that threshold, the company said. What sparked the ire of investors was that despite missing the target, SeaWorld still agreed to make the restricted share payouts, with D'Alessandro and eight of the company's senior executives forfeited 40 percent of the sum. Proxy adviser Glass Lewis recommended shareholders vote against D'Alessandro and another director at the annual meeting, citing the stock payouts. Proxy adviser ISS recommended shareholders vote against SeaWorld's compensation plans at the meeting, calling the restricted share payout  concerning  given the company's poor financial performance. SeaWorld's shares have fallen by half since its IPO. Shares of the $1.5 billion company rose 6.7 percent on Wednesday to $17.07 per share.  We have spoken to investors who share those concerns so a negative vote and some degree of board shakeup seem possible to us,  FBR analyst Barton Crockett said in a June 9 note. The company said in a letter to shareholders prior to the annual meeting that after considering certain factors, including achieving 97 percent of the investment multiple threshold, that it was appropriate for morale and employee retention to make the payouts. None of the company's new leadership team were eligible for the restricted shares, SeaWorld said.  Most of the covered individuals had been working for several years to stabilize the company,  SeaWorld said in its letter to shareholders. SeaWorld, which operates 12 theme parks in San Diego, Orlando and San Antonio, faced criticism after the release of the 2013 documentary  Blackfish,  which depicted the captivity and public exhibition of killer whales as inherently cruel. The company said last year it would stop breeding killer whales in captivity.

Uncertainty over a possible penalty stroke lingered over final-round leader Dustin Johnson, putting the status of the leaderboard in doubt before Johnson pulled away for an emphatic victory for his maiden major. Changes at Erin Hills include reliance on a central group of rules officials headed by chief referee Thomas Pagel, who is  empowered to make rulings, use of on-course video replay stations and adoption of local rules offering a more commonsense approach to inadvertent ball movement on the greens. Under the new protocols, Johnson would not be subject to a penalty as he had at Oakmont when his ball moved slightly before he addressed his putt on the fifth green of the final round. He would just remark his ball and play on. The USGA came in for withering criticism from players and fans alike for taking so long to clear up the Johnson ruling.  It affects the whole organization,  USGA executive director/CEO Mike Davis told reporters at a news conference on the eve of the opening round at Erin Hills in Wisconsin.  Anytime your competency comes into question, that affects the people that are doing our equipment testing, the agronomic people on the greens section, our people in dealing with the history of the game and helping to grow the game.  So, of course, we want to avoid those things.  Moving forward we want a nice, smooth U.S. Open.  Johnson officially claimed a three-stroke win despite a one-stroke penalty imposed after the round. John Bodenhamer, the USGA senior managing director of Championships & Governance, outlined the protocol changes at the news conference, reiterating details he shared in an interview with Reuters last week and. Bodenhamer said another change was dispensing with having a referee walk with each group. Instead, referees will be assigned two or three holes to officiate  so they can familiarize themselves with every aspect and nuance of those couple of holes.   Our main goal is for this week to be about the players and their journey to the final round,  Bodenhamer added:  They're the story of this championship.

A slide in technology stocks weighed on the Nasdaq and S&P; 500 as investors worried about the pace of economic growth after the rate increase and weaker-than-expected inflation data. The U.S. central bank lifted the benchmark lending rate by a quarter percentage point and announced it would begin cutting its huge holdings of bonds and securities this year. Its policy-setting committee also indicated the economy has been expanding moderately, and that it viewed a recent softness in inflation as transitory, according to a statement following a two-day meeting. Though they remained lower on the day, U.S. Treasury yields pared declines, with traders citing the hawkish tone of the statement. Data earlier Wednesday showed U.S. consumer prices unexpectedly fell in May, suggesting a softening in domestic demand. The U.S. yield curve flattened, with the difference between short-dated two-year Treasury yields and benchmark 10-year yields narrowing to a difference of 78.58 basis points , the smallest since Sept. 9.  It just looks like the Fed is sticking to their story and the market remains highly skeptical that the Fed is going to be able to deliver just based upon underlying data. I would think that at some point the market is going to be pricing in even greater risks that the Fed might be moving too quickly,  said Mark Cabana, head of U.S. short rates strategy at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in New York. Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes rose 23/32 in price to yield 2.1273 percent, from 2.207 percent late on Tuesday. The dollar index was last down 0.06 percent, with the euro unchanged at $1.1214. Oil Tumbles Crude oil prices fell sharply following an unexpectedly large buildup in gasoline stocks. That weighed heavily on U.S. energy sector shares, which contributed to the S&P; 500's decline. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 46.09 points, or 0.22 percent, to end at 21,374.56, the S&P; 500 lost 2.43 points, or 0.10 percent, to 2,437.92 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 25.48 points, or 0.41 percent, to 6,194.89. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index lost 0.35 percent and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.12 percent. U.S. crude fell 3.7 percent to settle at $44.73 per barrel and Brent settled at $47.00, down 3.5 percent. Gold turned negative after the Fed rate increase. Spot gold fell 0.2 percent at $1,263.03 an ounce.

June         and August         closed limit down at 124.500 cents and 117.875 cents, respectively. Both contracts ended below their respective 40-day moving averages of 124.545 and   120.100 cents.     CME live cattle's trading limit will expand to 4.500 cents on Thursday following Wednesday's limit-down settlement.     So far this week, a small number of market-ready, or cash, cattle in the U.S. Plains moved at $130 to $134 per cwt, down as much as $7 from a week ago in parts of the region, said feedlot sources.     Remaining cattle bids are at $128 per cwt with no response from sellers. Last week, cash cattle in the Plains traded at mostly $136 to $137.     Computer problems delayed Fed Cattle Exchange price reporting until next Wednesday.                  Processors last week may have purchased enough cattle in advance for this week's production, said KIS Futures vice president Lane Broadbent.     Traders and analysts said more than 40,000 animals for sale last week, and wholesale beef prices close to topping out seasonally, contributed to this week's bearish attitudes toward  cash returns.                  Sell stops and live cattle futures liquidation upended CME feeder cattle contracts.     August feeders         ended 3.825 cents per pound lower at 146.125 cents.

The changes come just two days after Steve Bolze, a 24-year GE veteran who heads the power unit, lost out to John Flannery, chief of GE's Healthcare division, as successor to CEO Jeff Immelt, which GE announced on Monday.  Flannery, who takes over Aug. 1, is conducting a review of GE's business, which include jet engines, power plants, locomotives and medical scanners.  The review could lead to further slimming of GE's portfolio, after it sold its finance, appliances and NBCUniversal units in recent years. Flannery said GE is sticking with its strategy of using software to increase the value of industrial equipment. Bolze, 54, will step aside on July 3 for GE Energy Connections chief Russell Stokes, a 20-year GE veteran who will lead the combined business under the name GE Power. Stokes is 45. Combining GE Power with the unit that provides power distribution and conversion equipment will create a division with $41.9 billion in revenue, making it GE's largest, accounting for 30 percent of its industrial revenue.  GE changes CEOs rarely and naming a new leader typically prompts the departure of those passed up for the top job. When Immelt took the title in 2001, prominent executives including Jim McNerney and Bob Nardelli left. McNerney went on to lead Boeing Co (BA.N) while Nardelli headed Home Depot Inc (HD.N) and Chrysler.   The brain drain is more muted this time,  said Deane Dray, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. Bolze said in a letter to employees that he had told Immelt he would retire if he was not chosen to lead the company.  Merging the energy connections unit into GE Power is not likely to significantly alter earnings or cash flow, so was not a major concern to investors, Dray added.

Not anymore. Left fielder Marcell Ozuna homered for the second consecutive game and drove in three runs, leading Miami to an 11-6 win over the Oakland A's on Wednesday afternoon at Marlins Park. Ozuna, who went 2-for-5 and is hitting .333 this season with 17 homers and 47 RBIs, helped Miami overcome an early 4-0 deficit.  He's been unreal,  Marlins center fielder Christian Yelich said of Ozuna, who leads the team in batting average and RBIs and is tied with Giancarlo Stanton for the lead in homers.  He's one of the best players in baseball right now.  Everything he hits seems to be extremely hard.  Yelich and Dee Gordon also contributed on Wednesday as each had two RBIs to lead the Marlins (29-35) to a sweep of the two-game series. Related CoveragePreview: Athletics at MarlinsOakland Athletics - PlayerWatchMiami Marlins - PlayerWatchOakland (27-38) is 9-25 on the road this season. The A's have lost nine straight series away from home, their worst road stretch since they did the same thing in 1986. Daniel Gossett (0-1), who made his major league debut, lasted just 3 1/3 innings and took the loss. He allowed seven runs (six earned), six hits and one walk. On the positive side, he went 1-for-1 and had a sacrifice bunt as a hitter, scoring a run. A's manager Bob Melvin said he thought Gossett  was on his way  after a 1-2-3 opening inning.  The first inning, he threw the ball really well, around the corners, sharp breaking balls,  Melvin said.  Then he threw some balls in the middle of the plate.  Melvin was asked if Gossett would stick around for another start or get sent back down to Triple-A Nashville.  I don't answer those questions right after the game,  Melvin said.  We have some injuries anyway. We brought him up for a reason.  Meanwhile, Miami's Edinson Volquez, who went 3-0 with a 0.41 ERA in his past three starts, lasted just four innings and escaped with a no-decision. He allowed five runs (four earned), four hits and four walks. Oakland's first run was unearned. Jed Lowrie drew a first-inning walk and advanced on a costly fielding error by Marlins third baseman Derek Dietrich. Had Dietrich made the play, the inning would've been over. Instead, Volquez walked the next two batters, giving Oakland a 1-0 lead. The A's made it 4-0 in the second with three more two-out RBIs. Ryon Healy's 15th homer of the season, a three-run shot, was preceded by a two-out walk to Lowrie. Miami closed its deficit to 4-2 in the bottom of the second on solo homers by Ozuna and Tyler Moore. And the Marlins tied the score 4-4 in the third, getting an RBI single by Yelich and a run-scoring groundout by Ozuna. Gossett, whose infield single led off the fourth inning, scored on Lowrie's double, putting Oakland on top 5-4.  I had no idea,  Gossett said when asked how he got his hit.  It looked like (the pitch) was 100 mph. Sometimes you can close your eyes and swing, and sometimes it works.  Miami, though, took a 7-5 lead in the bottom of the third. A fielding error by Healy at third base opened the gates, and the Marlins took advantage, getting an RBI double by pinch hitter Tomas Telis, an RBI single by Gordon and an RBI hit-by-pitch by Yelich. The Marlins added two more runs in the fifth, and the rout was on -- just as Ozuna had predicted when he reassured Volquez after Miami fell behind 4-0.  I told him, 'We're going to score for you',  Ozuna said.  Always be positive.  NOTES: A's RF Matt Joyce (laceration on his chin) left the game in the third inning after colliding with 1B Yonder Alonso. Joyce took three stitches, but  should be OK , A's manager Bob Melvin said. ... Marlins 1B Justin Bour (bruised left ankle) is expected to return Friday at the Atlanta Braves. ... Marlins 3B Martin Prado (right hamstring) is set to start a rehab assignment on Thursday. ... Oakland optioned OF/1B Matt Olson to Triple-A Nashville. ... Oakland RHP Daniel Gossett got a called strike on his first major league pitch on Wednesday. On his second pitch, he retired 2B Dee Gordon on a groundout. ...

Adam Neumann, whose company is now valued at some $17 billion, said the exchange where WeWork will list its shares is undecided, addressing a lunch event at the Economic Club of New York, held at the New York Stock Exchange. He praised NYSE Group President Tom Farley, who runs the exchange, for his persistence in seeking WeWork's listing. NYSE Group is owned by Intercontinental Exchange Inc (ICE.N). Neumann, who was quizzed by Farley in front of almost 200 people at the lunch, said his company will conduct an IPO, but did not say when that might occur. The company, which operates 149 locations in 15 countries, now has about 120,000 members who pay on average $650 a month each, Neumann said. Five to 10 new sites open every month. WeWork has raised about $1.8 billion from investors and venture capital funds since it began operations six years ago. SoftBank Group Corp (9984.T) invested $300 million in WeWork in March, the first of a much larger funding round that could total up to $3 billion, according to a person familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity. Two years ago, less than 1 percent of WeWork's business was generated by Fortune 500-type companies. That figure is now about 30 percent and growing, Neumann said, interpreting that as a sign of a viable business model. A communal housing model called WeLive, which the company has launched in New York City and Crystal City, Virginia, is 100-percent leased, but Neumann said the are no immediate plans to expand the concept as WeWork tries to perfect the product.

The complaint said Trump had not sought congressional approval for any of the payments his hundreds of businesses had received from foreign governments since he took office in January, even though the Constitution requires him to do so. The White House did not respond to requests for comment but has said Trump's business interests do not violate the Constitution. The Trump Organization has said it will donate profits from customers representing foreign governments to the U.S. Treasury but will not require such customers to identify themselves.  At least 30 U.S. senators and 166 representatives are plaintiffs in Wednesday's lawsuit, representing the largest number of legislators ever to sue a U.S. president, according to two lawmakers who are among the plaintiffs. It was the latest in a series of such lawsuits against the Republican president. The Constitution's  foreign emoluments  clause bars U.S. officeholders from accepting payments and various other gifts from foreign governments without congressional approval. The lawmakers are seeking a judicial order to require Trump to seek Congress' assent before he accepts such payments.  The presidentâs failure to tell us about these emoluments, to disclose the payments and benefits that he is receiving, mean that we cannot do our job. We cannot consent to what we donât know,  said Richard Blumenthal, the lead senator on the lawsuit, in a conference call on Tuesday.  John Conyers, the lead plaintiff from the House of Representatives, added: âPresident Trump has conflicts of interest in at least 25 countries, and it appears heâs using his presidency to maximize his profits.  The Justice Department declined to comment.  Similar lawsuits have been filed in recent months by parties including a nonprofit ethics group, a restaurant trade group, and the attorneys general of Maryland and the District of Columbia.  They allege that Trump's acceptance of payments from foreign and U.S. governments through his hospitality empire puts other hotel and restaurant owners at an unfair disadvantage and provides governments an incentive to give Trump-owned businesses special treatment.  Rare to Sue President In a motion to dismiss one such lawsuit on Friday, the Justice Department argued that the plaintiffs had not shown any specific harm to their businesses, and that Trump was only banned from receiving foreign government gifts if they arose from his service as president. On Monday, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said  partisan politics  was behind the lawsuit by the Maryland and District of Columbia officials. Lawmakers rarely sue the president, so there are few federal court decisions the legislators can cite to prove their legal standing to bring Wednesday's case, said Leah Litman, an assistant professor specializing in constitutional law at the University of California, Irvine. A 1997 Supreme Court decision by then-Chief Justice William Rehnquist indicates such cases have standing if the plaintiffs are numerous enough that they could have had a decisive impact on the vote from which they were excluded, said  Tara Grove, a professor specializing in federal courts and constitutional law at William & Mary Law School.  Courts are more and more receptive to the idea that a large group of federal lawmakers can sue over being deprived of their constitutionally conferred powers,  Grove said. Conyers and Blumenthal said they planned to reach out to their Republican colleagues in Congress to invite them to join the lawsuit.  I won't be surprised if a few do,  Conyers added.

After days of political turmoil sparked by her botched gamble on a snap election, May's Conservative Party resumed talks with a small Northern Irish Protestant party on securing the support of its 10 members of parliament to pass legislation. May said late on Wednesday that the talks were continuing, but that a fire that devastated a 24-storey tower block in London, killing at least 12 people, had taken priority.  Arlene Foster, the leader of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), met May for talks in Downing Street on Tuesday but Sky News reported she had returned to Belfast on Wednesday evening, leaving party colleagues to continue the negotiations.  We are continuing to have talks but today, as you will imagine, there has been a real focus on this terrible tragedy in London,  May said. Even with a deal nearing to secure her government's survival, May is so weakened that her Brexit strategy has become the subject of public debate inside her own party, with two former prime ministers urging her to soften her approach. May has said the divorce talks, likely to be the most complex in Europe since World War Two, will begin as planned next week and her Brexit minister, David Davis, said Britain's negotiating position was unchanged.   There is a unity of purpose among people in the United Kingdom,  May said following a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris.   It's a unity of purpose, having voted to leave the EU, that their government gets on with that and makes a success of it.  But with so much at stake for Britain and its $2.5 trillion economy, pressure was mounting on May from within and without her party to heed other voices. Related CoverageUK PM May says DUP talks continue but London fire a real focusBritish Lib Dem leader quits, says can't lead party and be a ChristianDUP leader returns to Northern Ireland, talks continue: Sky NewsMay now faces the task of satisfying both the pro-European and eurosceptic factions of her party, keeping Northern Ireland calm and negotiating a divorce with 27 other EU members whose combined economic might is more than five times that of Britain. Alice in Wonderland?  Before the election, May proposed a clean break from the EU, involving withdrawal from the EU single market, limits on immigration and a bespoke customs deal with the EU. The Times newspaper said finance minister Philip Hammond would push May not to leave the customs union - an arrangement that guarantees tariff-free trade within the bloc but prohibits members from striking trade deals with third parties. But a newly appointed junior Brexit minister, Steve Baker, told Reuters:  I don't foresee any change ... The reality is that where we stand follows logically from leaving, so, if we're leaving, what we need to do is do it smoothly and successfully and gain economic benefit.  France's Macron said the door was still open for Britain to remain in the EU, though he added that it would be difficult to walk back once negotiations start. The European Parliament's Brexit coordinator, Guy Verhofstadt, struck a harsher tone: Britain, he said, could change its mind, but it would be poorer.  Like Alice in Wonderland, not all the doors are the same. It will be a brand new door, with a new Europe, a Europe without rebates, without complexity, with real powers and with unity,  Verhofstadt said. May has not yet responded to a proposal from some Conservatives for business groups and lawmakers from all parties to agree a national position on Brexit.   We would restore faith in politics if we could show that this parliament can at least function in presenting a view in the national interest which would command a majority on a cross-party basis,  said veteran pro-European Conservative lawmaker Ken Clarke. Former prime minister David Cameron said May needed to listen to opposition parties, and that there would be pressure for a softer Brexit that would give greater priority to a close trading deal with the EU. Yet many of her lawmakers and party members favor a sharp break with the EU - a sign of the divisions over Europe that helped sink the premierships of May's predecessors Margaret Thatcher, John Major and Cameron.  The performance of the British economy could also influence perceptions: Data on Wednesday showed average weekly pay in the three months to April was down 0.4 percent, year-on-year, in inflation-adjusted terms - the biggest fall since the three months to September 2014.  Dup Talks May has given no indication that she will change her plan for Brexit, though she has said she will try to achieve broader agreement across her party. Whatever her ultimate plan, she will be heavily reliant upon the 10 lawmakers from the eurosceptic DUP, who would help her edge past the 326 votes needed in parliament to avoid the government collapsing. However, putting the pro-British unionist DUP in a position of influence in London could also undermine the British government's ability, enshrined in a 1998 peace agreement, to function as an impartial broker between Northern Ireland's unionists and its Catholic Irish nationalists. Major, who helped to bring about that peace, said he was concerned that May's arrangement with the DUP could pitch the province back into turmoil by persuading 'hard men' on both sides of the divide to return to violence. The Irish nationalist party Sinn Fein, which wants the British province to join a united Ireland, said the prospect was causing anxiety and fear in Northern Ireland.  While the DUP are deeply eurosceptic, they have balked at some of the practical implications of a so-called hard Brexit -- including the potential loss of an open border with the Republic of Ireland -- and the talks were likely to touch on efforts to minimize the potential damage to Northern Ireland.

Enis Berberoglu, the first CHP lawmaker to be handed prison time since the lifting of parliamentary immunities last year, was accused of giving an opposition newspaper video purporting to show Turkey's intelligence agency trucking weapons into Syria. CHP leader Kemal Kilicdaroglu said he would launch a march in protest against the conviction at an Ankara park on Thursday. Party officials said the march would head to Istanbul.  We are in the days where the actual guilty are not tried, but the innocent are,  he told reporters.  I will be in Guvenpark at 11 am (4.00 a.m. ET) tomorrow and we will begin our march until democracy and justice come to this country.  A report in the secular Cumhuriyet newspaper in May 2015 said that trucks allegedly owned by Turkey's state intelligence service were found to contain weapons and ammunition that were headed for Syria when they were stopped and searched in southern Turkey in early 2014.  The defendant has committed the crime of disclosing information that should remain secret for state security, domestic and external benefits, with the aim of political and military espionage,  the court document seen by Reuters said. The government has denied accusations that weapons were sent to Syria, saying the trucks were carrying humanitarian aid.

This decision is intimidation of the opposition. This decision is intimidation of all who are displeased with the AKP,  Altay told reporters outside the Istanbul court house, referring to President Tayyip Erdogan's ruling party. Following Cumhuriyet's report, Erdogan acknowledged the trucks belonged to the National Intelligence Organization (MIT), and said they were carrying aid to Turkmens battling Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and Islamic State.

Last year, Dundar and Gul were sentenced to at least five years in jail for revealing state secrets in a related case, and the prosecutor is now seeking an additional 10 years in prison for the two over the report on the trucks. Hurriyet Daily News editor Murat Yetkin noted Wednesday's ruling came as Turkey already faced pressure because of the jailing of journalists and politicians.  Rulings like this are likely to weaken the position of President Recep Tayyip ErdoÄan and the AK Party government in their diplomatic ventures, especially with the West,  he wrote. Rights groups and Turkey's Western allies have complained of deteriorating human rights under Erdogan, and a crackdown following last July's failed coup has seen 50,000 people jailed pending trial and some 150,000 detained or dismissed.

(Reuters) - Harvard University President Drew Faust, the first woman to serve in that post in the elite Ivy League school's 380-year history, plans to step down from her role at the end of the next academic year, she said on Wednesday. Faust, a historian, has run Harvard since 2007. Her leadership helped guide the world's richest university through the turbulent 2008 financial crisis, when Harvard's endowment tumbled 22 percent in four months, and also through controversies relating to race and sex assault.  It has been a privilege beyond words to work with all of you to lead Harvard,  Faust, 69, said in an e-mail to staff. She listed a series of challenges the school faces now, including eroding federal funding for research and  advancing the work of inclusion and belonging that enables every member of our community to thrive.  Faust, whose academic work focuses on the U.S. Civil War and the southeastern United States, said she would step down on June 30, 2018, leaving the school a little more than a year to name her successor. She is expected to remain on the faculty. She sharply raised the amount of financial aid the school offers students to $539 million last year from $339 million in 2007. Harvard said that move has sharply raised the number of students from low- and middle-income families who enroll. Harvard University President Drew Faust (C) congratulates students after they received their degrees during the 366th Commencement Exercises at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, May 25, 2017.Brian SnyderFaust also started a capital drive that has raised some $8 billion thus far for the school based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, just outside Boston. Slideshow (3 Images)Last year, Harvard replaced the academic shield of its law school to remove the 18th Century crest of a slave-owning family that helped endow the school, and also took steps to honor slaves who worked at the campus in the 1700s. Like most major U.S. universities, Harvard has grappled with how to handle sexual assault and harassment on campus, creating an office in 2014 to investigate campus sex crimes. During Faust's tenure as president, Harvard also received the two largest gifts in its history, a $350 million 2014 donation from the Morningside Foundation given to the Harvard School of Public Health, eclipsed the following year by a $400 million gift from hedge fund investor John Paulson. Faust also saw the return to campus of the Reserve Officer Training Corps program, aimed at educating officers headed to the U.S. military. The ROTC had not been at Harvard since the Vietnam War.

The complaint said Trump had not sought congressional approval for any of the payments his hundreds of businesses had received from foreign governments since he took office in January, even though the Constitution requires him to do so. The White House did not respond to requests for comment but has said Trump's business interests do not violate the Constitution. The Trump Organization has said it will donate profits from customers representing foreign governments to the U.S. Treasury but will not require such customers to identify themselves.  At least 30 U.S. senators and 166 representatives are plaintiffs in Wednesday's lawsuit, representing the largest number of legislators ever to sue a U.S. president, according to two lawmakers who are among the plaintiffs. It was the latest in a series of such lawsuits against the Republican president. The Constitution's  foreign emoluments  clause bars U.S. officeholders from accepting payments and various other gifts from foreign governments without congressional approval. The lawmakers are seeking a judicial order to require Trump to seek Congress' assent before he accepts such payments.  The presidentâs failure to tell us about these emoluments, to disclose the payments and benefits that he is receiving, mean that we cannot do our job. We cannot consent to what we donât know,  said Richard Blumenthal, the lead senator on the lawsuit, in a conference call on Tuesday.  John Conyers, the lead plaintiff from the House of Representatives, added: âPresident Trump has conflicts of interest in at least 25 countries, and it appears heâs using his presidency to maximize his profits.  The Justice Department declined to comment.  Similar lawsuits have been filed in recent months by parties including a nonprofit ethics group, a restaurant trade group, and the attorneys general of Maryland and the District of Columbia.  They allege that Trump's acceptance of payments from foreign and U.S. governments through his hospitality empire puts other hotel and restaurant owners at an unfair disadvantage and provides governments an incentive to give Trump-owned businesses special treatment.  Rare to Sue President In a motion to dismiss one such lawsuit on Friday, the Justice Department argued that the plaintiffs had not shown any specific harm to their businesses, and that Trump was only banned from receiving foreign government gifts if they arose from his service as president. On Monday, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said  partisan politics  was behind the lawsuit by the Maryland and District of Columbia officials. Lawmakers rarely sue the president, so there are few federal court decisions the legislators can cite to prove their legal standing to bring Wednesday's case, said Leah Litman, an assistant professor specializing in constitutional law at the University of California, Irvine. A 1997 Supreme Court decision by then-Chief Justice William Rehnquist indicates such cases have standing if the plaintiffs are numerous enough that they could have had a decisive impact on the vote from which they were excluded, said  Tara Grove, a professor specializing in federal courts and constitutional law at William & Mary Law School.  Courts are more and more receptive to the idea that a large group of federal lawmakers can sue over being deprived of their constitutionally conferred powers,  Grove said. Conyers and Blumenthal said they planned to reach out to their Republican colleagues in Congress to invite them to join the lawsuit.  I won't be surprised if a few do,  Conyers added.

The news underscored the market's ongoing struggles with weak gasoline demand in the United States, the world's top consumer of the motor fuel, and rising production, especially from U.S. shale drillers.  Despite nearly six months of OPEC-led efforts to reduce a global glut, oil prices have not stabilized at higher levels as many had anticipated when the group agreed with other producers to cut supply back.  We need to see a sign that the OPEC cuts are having an impact on world oil supplies and it's clearly not, at least not yet,  said Tamar Essner, lead energy analyst at Nasdaq. After rising for three consecutive days, U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures CLc1 fell $1.73, or 3.7 percent, to settle at $44.73 per barrel, its lowest close since Nov. 14. WTI has dropped 18 percent since its closing high of $54.45 in late February. Brent LCOc1 also slumped, losing $1.72, or 3.5 percent, to settle at $47 a barrel. That was the lowest close for Brent since Nov. 29, the day before OPEC agreed to cut output. Analysts said both benchmarks were dragged lower by a bigger than 4 percent drop in U.S. gasoline futures RBc1 after the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported a 2.1 million-barrel increase in gasoline inventories last week. At 242.4 million, U.S. gasoline inventories were 9 percent higher than the five-year average as demand was down 1.2 percent over the last four weeks when compared with a year ago, according to EIA.  The bearish gasoline data overshadowed a 1.7 million-barrel drawdown in U.S. crude stocks, analysts said.  Persistent weakness in gasoline demand has taken center stage among market participants as this could result in further builds in U.S. crude stockpiles,â said Abhishek Kumar, senior energy analyst at Interfax Energyâs Global Gas Analytics in London.   The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other exporters such as Russia have agreed to keep production almost 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) below the levels pumped at the end of last year and not to increase output until the end of the first quarter of 2018. But adherence to the cuts is under scrutiny. The producer group said this week its output rose by 336,000 bpd in May to 32.14 million bpd. Nigeria and Libya are responsible for much of that rise, and they are exempt from cuts. Producers outside the OPEC deal are increasing output, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said. The West's energy watchdog expects growth in supply of 1.5 million bpd in 2018, driven by non-OPEC producers like Brazil, Canada and the United States; that level would exceed expected demand growth of 1.4 million bpd.  Our first outlook for 2018 makes sobering reading for those producers looking to restrain supply,  the IEA said in its monthly oil market report.

Scalise was shot in the hip on Wednesday morning as he and other Republican lawmakers practiced for a game against their Democratic rivals in Congress. He was in critical condition after surgery at a Washington hospital. As the majority whip in the House, the 51-year-old Scalise is responsible for rounding up votes and maintaining order among the Republican Party's fractious ranks.  He is in the job largely as a bridge to conservative groups inside the House Republican caucus, but he has struggled at times to prevent them from stymyimg the agenda of the Republican leadership.  Widely seen as well-liked among colleagues, many paid tribute to him in the hours after the attack. Scalise first went to Congress in 2008 following a decade in the Louisiana state legislature, and quickly ascended into the ranks of party leadership.  An ardent supporter of Trump inside the Republican Party, he has an A+ rating from the National Rifle Association, a powerful lobbying group that fights for gun-ownership rights.  Scalise is popular inside his deeply conservative Louisiana district, which encircles New Orleans and Lake Pontchartrain  and includes the swampy bayou region where the Mississippi River spills into the Gulf of Mexico. He won re-election in November with 75 percent of his district's vote. Before becoming majority whip, Scalise was chairman of the conservative Republican Study Committee, which includes more than 170 conservative lawmakers. Â  In 2014, Scalise's office confirmed he had addressed a white supremacist group connected to former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke in 2002 when he was a state representative.  Seeking to play down the controversy, Scalise's office said he had spoken to hundreds of groups during his political career and was unaware of the views of the European-American Unity and Rights Organization. Scalise has played shortstop in the annual congressional baseball game, which began more than a century ago and pits Democrats against Republicans to raise money for charity.  Knowing Steve Scalise as we all do, he is likely really frustrated that he will not be able to play in the baseball game,  Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan said in a speech about the attack from the House floor on Wednesday.

The Nasdaq cut its loss in more than half in a late rebound, having earlier fallen 1 percent, while financials buoyed the Dow industrials. The U.S. central bank cited continued U.S. economic growth and job market strength, proceeding with its first tightening cycle in more than a decade. But some investors worried about the Fed's hawkish tone and that concerns about rate hikes were being reflected in the tech sector, which has led the S&P; 500's nearly 9-percent rally this year. The tech sector fell 0.5 percent, recovering from steeper losses in the session and coming on the heels of its biggest two-day swoon in nearly a year. Tech remains up 18 percent in 2017.  I think itâs more of what we saw starting last week, where you have a very crowded trade ... If they are going to get more nervous about the stock market, thatâs where you are going to see the selling,  said William Delwiche, Investment Strategist at Robert W. Baird & Co in Milwaukee. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 46.09 points, or 0.22 percent, to 21,374.56, the S&P; 500 lost 2.43 points, or 0.10 percent, to 2,437.92 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 25.48 points, or 0.41 percent, to 6,194.89. Earlier on Wednesday, data showed U.S. consumer prices unexpectedly fell in May and retail sales recorded their biggest drop in 16 months.  The kiss of death for tech stocks is negative GDP or a slowdown in the software and equipment component,  said Daniel Morgan, portfolio manager at Synovus Trust in Atlanta.  Hence, the tech sector is selling off on concerns that todayâs Fed hike will slow GDP, retarding future tech profit growth.   Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S.,  June 2, 2017.Brendan McDermidFinancials, which have underperformed this year and tend to benefit in a rising rate environment, rallied late to close up 0.2 percent. The group had fallen as much as 1.3 percent during the session. The energy sector dropped 1.8 percent as oil prices weakened. U.S. data showed an unexpectedly large weekly build in U.S. gasoline inventories and International Energy Agency (IEA) data projected a big increase in non-OPEC output in 2018. The Dow Jones Transport Average index, seen by some as a barometer of economic activity, ended down 0.7 percent. The Fed clearly outlined a plan to reduce its $4.2-trillion portfolio of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, most of which were purchased in the wake of the 2007-2009 financial crisis and recession.  The market should take confidence in the fact that theyâre being very transparent in setting clear policy steps in terms of how they normalize the balance sheet,  said Heidi Learner, chief economist for Savills Studley, a unit of Savills Plc, in New York.  Certainly more transparency is a good thing.  In corporate news, Alexion shares jumped 9.3 percent and were the biggest percentage gainers on the S&P; 500 after the biotechnology company named Biogen's chief financial officer as its CFO. Biogen's stock fell 3.1 percent. H & R Block rose 7.9 percent after the tax preparation service's quarterly revenue and profit beat analysts' expectations. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.13-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.41-to-1 ratio favored decliners. About 7.1 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, above the 6.8 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

Stefan Lumiere, 46, was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan federal court, according to federal prosecutors. Prosecutors had said in a brief filed in court that they believed a sentence of up to 14 years would be appropriate. Lumiere's lawyers, Jonathan Halpern and Jon Friedman, said in a joint statement that they were by the lighter sentence and that Lumiere planned to appeal. Lumiere, whose sister was married to Visium founder Jacob Gottlieb when he worked at the hedge fund, was found guilty of conspiracy, securities fraud and wire fraud charges in January after a six-day trial. The trial followed a investigation of Visium that prompted the $8 billion firm's wind-down and charges against three others, including Sanjay Valvani, a portfolio manager who committed suicide in June after being accused of insider trading. Prosecutors said Lumiere and others conspired from 2011 to 2013 to mismark the value of securities held by a bond fund, which invested in debt issued by healthcare companies and which in 2012 reported peak net assets of $471.5 million. Lumiere and others rigged the process of valuing the Visium Credit Opportunities Fund's distressed-debt holdings by, among other things, obtaining sham quotes from brokers, who gave them the inflated values they wanted, prosecutors said.

Scalise was shot in the hip on Wednesday morning as he and other Republican lawmakers practiced for a game against their Democratic rivals in Congress. He was in critical condition after surgery at a Washington hospital. As the majority whip in the House, the 51-year-old Scalise is responsible for rounding up votes and maintaining order among the Republican Party's fractious ranks.  He is in the job largely as a bridge to conservative groups inside the House Republican caucus, but he has struggled at times to prevent them from stymyimg the agenda of the Republican leadership.  Widely seen as well-liked among colleagues, many paid tribute to him in the hours after the attack. Scalise first went to Congress in 2008 following a decade in the Louisiana state legislature, and quickly ascended into the ranks of party leadership.  An ardent supporter of Trump inside the Republican Party, he has an A+ rating from the National Rifle Association, a powerful lobbying group that fights for gun-ownership rights.  Scalise is popular inside his deeply conservative Louisiana district, which encircles New Orleans and Lake Pontchartrain  and includes the swampy bayou region where the Mississippi River spills into the Gulf of Mexico. He won re-election in November with 75 percent of his district's vote. Before becoming majority whip, Scalise was chairman of the conservative Republican Study Committee, which includes more than 170 conservative lawmakers. Â  In 2014, Scalise's office confirmed he had addressed a white supremacist group connected to former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke in 2002 when he was a state representative.  Seeking to play down the controversy, Scalise's office said he had spoken to hundreds of groups during his political career and was unaware of the views of the European-American Unity and Rights Organization. Scalise has played shortstop in the annual congressional baseball game, which began more than a century ago and pits Democrats against Republicans to raise money for charity.  Knowing Steve Scalise as we all do, he is likely really frustrated that he will not be able to play in the baseball game,  Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan said in a speech about the attack from the House floor on Wednesday.

The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against six major currencies, fell to its lowest level since Nov. 9 in early trading after the release of weaker-than-expected U.S. inflation and retail sales figures.  U.S. retail sales in May recorded their biggest drop in 16 months and the Consumer Price Index unexpectedly fell month-over-month, suggesting inflation pressures could be moderating. However, the Federal Reserve, in the statement released at the close of a two-day policy meeting, indicated it viewed the recent weakness in economic data as temporary, and it detailed expectations to continue raising rates. The Fed also laid out plans to pare back its $4 trillion balance sheet this year.  The Fedâs message is that theyâre not overreacting to  the CPI and retail sales data, said Richard Franulovich, senior currency strategist at Westpac Banking Corp.   Itâs very much a full-steam-ahead message, and the dot plot says they expect to hike once more this year. Thatâs on the hawkish side of expectations and as a result the dollar has clawed back a lot of its earlier losses.  The policy makers' release of quarterly economic forecasts is often referred to as the  dot plot  because of the chart indicating the Fed's rate setters' expectations. Fed Chair Janet Yellen's news conference highlighted the central bank's rosy outlook on the economy, boosting the dollar broadly.  The euro, after earlier rising to its highest level against the dollar since Nov. 9, was last little changed at $1.1215. Against the yen, the dollar was last down 0.35 percent, to 109.70 yen, after falling as much as 1 percent and hitting its lowest level against the Japanese currency since April. Commodity-linked currencies such as the Australian, New Zealand and Canadian dollars also pared gains against the U.S. currency after touching multi-month highs following the release of U.S. data.  Now that the Fed is apparently not as dovish as we thought and wonât be reacting to weak inflation numbers, the Aussie and kiwi are naturally giving up their gains,  Franulovich said.

The newspaper said Britain wanted these rights to be available only to those EU nationals who were living in the country before March 29 this year, when the government triggered the start of the two-year process of leaving the EU. But it is likely to accede to EU demands that the date should be when Britain leaves the EU in 2019, the FT said.  British Prime Minister Theresa May has called on the EU to issue a sweeping, reciprocal guarantee of rights for British expatriates living in the EU after Brexit. But EU leaders insist these must be negotiated in detail for them to have any legal value as reassurance for those people affected. The FT, citing anonymous officials, said Davis would offer to guarantee the rights that EU citizens currently have in Britain, such as the freedom to move and work in the country, and aim to treat them  as fairly as they have been to this point .  The newspaper said one area of concern for the EU was whether those EU nationals living in Britain would be able to access the European Court of Justice, a  red line  for London. A spokeswoman for the Brexit department said:  We have said consistently that resolving the status of EU citizens living in the UK and UK nationals living in other member states is our first priority for negotiations.    Britain's preparations for the complex Brexit talks have been thrown into turmoil after Prime Minister Theresa May failed to secure a parliamentary majority in a national election last week.  The government is still in talks with a small Northern Irish party to secure the support of its 10 members of parliament to pass legislation.

The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against six major currencies, fell to its lowest level since Nov. 9 in early trading after the release of weaker-than-expected U.S. inflation and retail sales figures.  U.S. retail sales in May recorded their biggest drop in 16 months and the Consumer Price Index unexpectedly fell month-over-month, suggesting inflation pressures could be moderating. However, the Federal Reserve, in the statement released at the close of a two-day policy meeting, indicated it viewed the recent weakness in economic data as temporary, and it detailed expectations to continue raising rates. The Fed also laid out plans to pare back its $4 trillion balance sheet this year.  The Fedâs message is that theyâre not overreacting to  the CPI and retail sales data, said Richard Franulovich, senior currency strategist at Westpac Banking Corp.   Itâs very much a full-steam-ahead message, and the dot plot says they expect to hike once more this year. Thatâs on the hawkish side of expectations and as a result the dollar has clawed back a lot of its earlier losses.  The policy makers' release of quarterly economic forecasts is often referred to as the  dot plot  because of the chart indicating the Fed's rate setters' expectations. Fed Chair Janet Yellen's news conference highlighted the central bank's rosy outlook on the economy, boosting the dollar broadly.  The euro, after earlier rising to its highest level against the dollar since Nov. 9, was last little changed at $1.1215. Against the yen, the dollar was last down 0.35 percent, to 109.70 yen, after falling as much as 1 percent and hitting its lowest level against the Japanese currency since April. Commodity-linked currencies such as the Australian, New Zealand and Canadian dollars also pared gains against the U.S. currency after touching multi-month highs following the release of U.S. data.  Now that the Fed is apparently not as dovish as we thought and wonât be reacting to weak inflation numbers, the Aussie and kiwi are naturally giving up their gains,  Franulovich said.

A sprawling links-style layout nestled in the bucolic Wisconsin countryside about 35 miles outside Milwaukee, Erin Hills offers a new challenge for the world's best golfers and an equalling daunting test for everyone from volunteers to police. With no blueprint to follow, getting more than 35,000 spectators, 5,000-plus volunteers, hundreds of media and 156 golfers in and out and around the golf course will be a monumental logistical feat.  It's tough,  United States Golf Association executive director Mike Davis told Reuters on Wednesday.  Not having an event at the same place every year is a challenge because you have different volunteers, different vendors, different police.  It's not like the Players Championship or the Masters or the John Deere or whatever where it is the same place, so it has its challenges.  Once you've done an event at the same place over and over you get pretty good at it.  As with most big sporting or entertainment events weather is the wildcard, and with blazing temperatures and a threat of violent thunderstorms spectator safety will be a prime concern. As menacing clouds gathered on Wednesday several spectators who asked red-shirted volunteers where to go if the evacuation siren sounds were told to seek cover, which may prove difficult at a venue with only a handful of permanent buildings on site. With just one two-lane road leading in and out of Erin Hills and only 300 parking spaces on site the U.S. Open will be a major traffic headache for both fans and police.  Most of what we are worried about right now is weather-related issues,  said Davis.  We are very likely to get some pretty significant rains later today.  They're predicting more rain Thursday night into Friday morning, likely some on Saturday.  The normal things you are worried about.  After U.S. Opens at Oakmont and Chambers Bay the last two years came under criticism - the former for a rules controversy and the latter for the condition of putting greens - the USGA is desperate for the 117th edition run smoothly. While the USGA and organisers believe they have prepared for almost every contingency Davis admitted you never know what can happen.  We know we've had some issues the last two years,  said Davis.  Moving forward we want a nice, smooth U.S. Open.   But, listen, we're prepared -- you never know what's going to happen with Mother Nature.  You're never going to know what happens with certain rule situations or how the players play the course.  So you just deal with them and you remain nimble and flexible.

In lifting its benchmark lending rate by a quarter percentage point to a target range of 1.00 percent to 1.25 percent and forecasting one more hike this year, the Fed seemed to largely brush off a recent run of mixed economic data. The U.S. central bank's rate-setting committee said the economy had continued to strengthen, job gains remained solid and indicated it viewed a recent softness in inflation as largely transitory. The Fed also gave a first clear outline on its plan to reduce its $4.2 trillion portfolio of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, most of which were purchased in the wake of the 2007-2009 financial crisis and recession. It expects to begin the normalization of its balance sheet this year, gradually ramping up the pace. The plan, which would feature halting reinvestments of ever-larger amounts of maturing securities, did not specify the overall size of the reduction.  What I can tell you is that we anticipate reducing reserve balances and our overall balance sheet to levels appreciably below those seen in recent years but larger than before the financial crisis,  Fed Chair Janet Yellen said in a press conference following the release of the Fed's policy statement. She added that the balance sheet normalization could be put into effect  relatively soon.  Related CoverageInstant View: Fed raises rates, gives details on balance sheet reductionFed poised to move on plan to gradually trim its bond holdingsThe initial cap for the reduction of the Fed's Treasuries holdings would be set at $6 billion per month, increasing by $6 billion increments every three months over a 12-month period until it reached $30 billion per month. For agency debt and mortgage-backed securities, the cap will be $4 billion per month initially, rising by $4 billion at quarterly intervals over a year until it reached $20 billion per month. U.S. stocks edged lower and prices of U.S. Treasuries pared gains after the Fed's policy statement. The dollar .DXY was largely flat against a basket of currencies after reversing earlier losses, while the price of gold fell.  The Fed announcing an update to their reinvestment principles leaves September open (for) the start of balance sheet runoff, and the fact that they haven't slowed their projected path of rate hikes suggest they can do both balance sheet and rate hikes at the same time,  said Gennadiy Goldberg, interest rate strategist at TD Securities. Federal Reserve Board Chairwoman Janet Yellen arrives for a news conference after the Fed releases its monetary policy decisions in Washington, U.S., June 14, 2017.Joshua RobertsEyes on Inflation The Fed has now raised rates four times as part of a normalization of monetary policy that began in December 2015. The central bank had pushed rates to near zero in response to the financial crisis.  Fed policymakers also released their latest set of quarterly economic forecasts, which showed only temporary concern about inflation and continued confidence about economic growth in the coming years. Slideshow (6 Images)They forecast U.S. economic growth of 2.2 percent in 2017, an increase from the previous projection in March. Inflation was expected to be at 1.7 percent by the end of this year, down from the 1.9 percent previously forecast. A retreat in inflation over the past two months has caused jitters that the shortfall, if sustained, could alter the pace of future rate hikes. But the Fed maintained its forecast for three rate hikes next year.  The Fed's preferred measure of underlying inflation has retreated to 1.5 percent, from 1.8 percent earlier this year, and has run below the central bank's 2 percent target for more than five years. Earlier on Wednesday, the Labor Department reported consumer prices unexpectedly fell in May, the second drop in three months. Yellen indicated the Fed still remained confident inflation would rise to its target over the medium term, bolstered by what she described as a robust labor market that is continuing to strengthen. The Fed's estimates for the unemployment rate by the end of this year moved down to 4.3 percent, the current level, and to 4.2 percent in 2018, indicating the Fed believes the labor market will continue to tighten. The median estimate of the long-run neutral rate, which is seen as the level of monetary policy that neither boosts nor slows the economy, was unchanged at 3.0 percent.

The Fed's interest rate increase, following a two-day meeting, marked its second this year. Interest rates are seen rising one more time by the end of this year, according to the median projection of the forecasts released with the Fed's policy statement, in keeping with the previous forecast.      Yields rose from earlier levels on the hawkish tone of the statement and the U.S. yield curve flattened, with the difference between short-dated two-year Treasury yields and benchmark 10-year yields narrowing to a difference of 78.58 basis points, the smallest since Sept. 9.     While the Fed indicated that a recent softening in inflation was seen as transitory, long- and medium-dated yields remained not far from their lowest levels since November touched earlier, when weak Consumer Price Index and retail sales data for May stoked doubts that the Fed would be able to hike rates in the second half of 2017.      Shorter-dated yields also remained lower on the day as traders doubted the Fed's hawkish outlook given the recent soft inflation readings.     The Labor Department said earlier Wednesday that its Consumer Price Index (CPI) dipped 0.1 percent in May. The so-called core CPI, which strips out food and energy costs, increased 1.7 percent year-on-year, the smallest rise since May 2015.       The market remains highly skeptical that the Fed is going to be able to deliver just based upon underlying data,  said Mark Cabana, head of U.S. short rates strategy at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in New York.      U.S. 10-year yields were last at 2.138 percent after touching 2.103 percent earlier, their lowest since Nov. 10. U.S. 30-year yields were last at 2.780 percent after touching their lowest since Nov. 9 of 2.765 earlier.      U.S. two- and three-year yields were last at 1.343 percent and 1.476 percent, compared to 1.363 percent and 1.505 percent late Tuesday, after tumbling to eight-day lows of 1.290 percent and 1.417 earlier.

But if special counsel Robert Mueller is looking for near-contemporaneous corroboration of Comey's state of mind after a critical and disputed conversation with President Trump, Sessions provided it.  During the hearing, the AG criticized Comeyâs âusurpationâ of authority when the FBI director disclosed the outcome last summer of the bureauâs investigation into Hillary Clintonâs use of a private e-mail server. Sessions stood by his May 9 memo to President Trump in which he said Comey should be removed to give a âfresh startâ to the FBI. The AG also disputed Comeyâs account of Sessionsâ reaction when the FBI director asked the AG not to leave him alone with President Donald Trump.  Sessions also, however, confirmed that Comey appeared to be concerned about being asked to do something improper after a meeting with President Trump on April 14.  We donât know whether special counsel Mueller is investigating a potential obstruction of justice case based on Comeyâs assertion that Trump asked him at that April 14 meeting to drop the FBIâs investigation of former national security adviser Michael Flynn. If Mueller is probing Comeyâs account, however, itâs significant that Sessions essentially corroborated Comeyâs state of mind after that private conversation with President Trump.  President Trump said in a press conference last week that he did not ask Comey to drop the Flynn probe. In a tweet, he said he felt vindicated by the fired FBI director's testimony, despite Comeyâs âfalse statements and lies.â  Mark Corallo, a spokesman for Trump's personal counsel Marc Kasowitz, declined to comment in response to an email query about Sessionsâ testimony. Peter Carr, a spokesman for special counsel Mueller, also declined to comment.  In Sessions' testimony Tuesday, the AG did dispute some of the particulars of Comeyâs story about his interactions with President Trump. The former FBI chief said in his testimony last week that Sessions lingered at an April 14 Oval Office meeting in which Trump asked Comey to stay, after dismissing everyone else. Comey said he sensed the AG might have been concerned the president was going to make an improper request.  According to Comey, once everyone else had left the room, President Trump asked him to drop the Flynn investigation.  In Tuesdayâs testimony, Sessions agreed that he was one of the last men to leave the Oval Office that day but said in response to questions from Senator Marco Rubio that he didnât have âa major problemâ with a private meeting between Comey and Trump. âI knew Jim Comey could handle himself well,â Sessions said.  The AG also disputed Comeyâs account of his response when the former FBI director approached him after the April 14 meeting. Comey testified that Sessions just nodded when Comey asked the AG to be sure he wasnât left alone with the president again. Sessions said Tuesday that he and his chief of staff remembered the response differently. According to the AG, he told Comey that the FBI director should follow Justice Department protocol on contacts between the White House and DOJ.  âI think heâs incorrect,â Sessions told Senator Roy Blunt about Comeyâs recollection.  Sessions said Comey did not tell him why he was agitated. Comey testified that he could not discuss the specifics with Sessions because the AG was recused from the FBIâs investigation of possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russian officials. (Comey said he raised concerns with the acting deputy AG but did not receive a response before he was fired.)  Sessions did not accuse Comey of either false statement or lies. He seemed to go out of his way to limit his criticism of Comeyâs handling of the Clinton e-mail case.  Most importantly, Sessions said he interpreted Comeyâs request not to be left alone with the president âas concern he might be asked something improper.â  When two participants in a conversation offer different accounts - as Trump and Comey apparently do of their April 14 meeting -  the most obvious thing the government looks for is corroboration,  said a white-collar defense lawyer. He said Sessions' account of his conversation with Comey after that meeting seems to back Comey. Sessions' testimony, he said, is all the more notable because he is  someone on the side of the president.   To be sure, thatâs not outright vindication of Comeyâs description of his conversation with the president. Those specifics can only be verified if, as the president has hinted, audiotapes exist. But in his testimony, Sessions confirmed under oath that a man he regarded as an experienced and unflappable prosecutor was unnerved by his private meeting with the president.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-otc-sessions-idUSKBN1952YZ"},

The amendment appears intended to avoid the administration's legal case at the U.S. Supreme Court becoming moot on grounds that parts of the executive order have expired. Challengers to the ban have said in court papers that it should expire on Wednesday, 90 days after the executive order was due to take effect on March 16. A memo issued by the White House, as the Supreme Court considered two challenges to the ban, said parts of the order put on hold would not expire before they can go into effect, and the start date would be when court injunctions were lifted. The move is part of administration efforts to have the high court rule that the controversial ban should immediately go into effect after Trump's first attempts to impose travel restrictions were blocked by lower courts. Lawsuits by Hawaii and Maryland challengers argued the order violated federal immigration law and a section of the Constitution's First Amendment, which prohibits the government favoring or disfavoring any particular religion. The Trump administration has said it is needed to protect national security. Soon after the memo was issued, Acting Solicitor General Jeff Wall filed court papers saying that it resolved  any doubt  about the effective date of the order. If the case was moot, the nine justices would have no reason to rule on it and lower court rulings against the administration would remain in place. The Supreme Court on Tuesday gave the Trump administration more time to file papers responding to an appeals court ruling on Monday that upheld a block on the travel ban. The court's action likely delayed any decision on administration requests for the ban to go into effect until at least next week. Federal judges in Maryland and Hawaii blocked Trump's 90-day ban on travelers from Libya, Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The Hawaii judge also blocked a 120-day ban on refugees entering the United States. The 9th Circuit largely upheld the Hawaii injunction on Monday. In the second case, the Richmond, Virginia-based 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, on May 25 upheld the Maryland judge's ruling.

Shares in Acacia, which is 63.9 percent owned by Barrick, jumped as much as 11 percent, to 303 pence, after the news and closed 5.5 percent higher, outpacing sector rivals. Tanzania is Africa's fourth-largest gold producer, and Acacia its largest miner, with three gold mines that also produce copper in the East African country. Acacia's market value has nearly halved to about $1.4 billion since Tanzania banned the export of unprocessed ore in March, part of a push for the construction of a local smelter to make the country's gold exports more valuable.  I feel very optimistic that we will reach a resolution which is a win-win,  Barrick Chairman John Thornton said after meeting Tanzanian President John Magufuli.  We'll be sitting down soon with a team designated by the president and our own team.  A statement from the president's office said that Barrick is ready to discuss  the payment of compensation of losses incurred by Tanzania from the company's operations in the country.  It also said Thornton agreed to cooperate with Tanzania to build a smelter in the country.  In one or two weeks, we will begin full negotiations... we should be able to come to a compromise,  Magafulu said. Tanzania's justice and constitutional affairs minister said the country would immediately begin the process of amending its mining, gas and tax laws to ensure it benefited more from its natural resources. The government, which has alleged that Acacia has evaded taxes, said its audit showed the miner had 10 times more gold in containers prepared for export than it declared.  We have never stolen, we have never evaded taxes, we have never forged documents to avoid paying royalties and we have never been unlawful,  Acacia Chief Executive Brad Gordon said in a June 13 internal memo. Acacia, which may provide a further update on a previously-scheduled call on Thursday, said that Barrick has agreed to begin talks, but no agreement has been reached. Barrick, which reports second-quarter results on July 26, has said that if Acacia needs to revise its 2017 forecast, Barrick would evaluate adjustments to its own full-year outlook. Acacia accounts for approximately 10 percent of Barrick's 2017 forecast output of 5.3-5.6 million ounces of gold.

The flailing clothier owned by TPG Capital and Leonard Green & Partners is trying to restructure some $567 million of notes by offering holders a deal that runs the risk of irking another set of creditors. So J.Crew has stitched something up for them, too. If it manages to thread the needle, J.Crew may provide a blueprint for other wobbly retailers contemplating bankruptcy. The first problem J.Crew is trying to solve is eliminating notes that come due in 2019. These IOUs have a paid-in-kind structure, and interest has been building since the company issued the notes in 2013. The new deal offers noteholders, including Blackstoneâs debt outfit GSO, new bonds, preferred stock, and equity in a reorganized J.Crew. Since the deal was announced on Monday, the securities have increased in price, suggesting owners like the plan. Importantly, though, this exchange means the new notes will be backed by intellectual property, notably J.Crewâs trademark and legally registered name, valued at some $250 million. TPG had transferred these from J.Crew into a subsidiary late last year. Lenders higher up the capital structure didn't like that asset transfer and filed a lawsuit to block it. To get them on board, J.Crew has offered to buy $150 million of their debt at par so long as they drop litigation on the matter. These loan holders, including Highland Capital, may rightly feel a bit squeezed. But their loans are trading at a 30 percent discount, according to Eikon, and some analysts agree that the credit agreements gave TPG the right to transfer these assets. This deal, then, could offer more certainty than messy litigation. J.Crew isnât alone in swapping around valuable trademarks and other intangible assets. More than 20 of the 25 retailers Moodyâs Investors Service rates B3 negative and below have credit agreements that permit asset transfers to unrestricted subsidiaries. One of them, Neiman Marcus, moved its MyTheresa brand into a subsidiary. On Tuesday, the department-store chain abandoned efforts to sell itself. Given the vagaries of the American retail business, there will be more restructurings like J.Crewâs. Rivals who once mimicked the fashionable items on its racks will soon be copycatting its debt restructuring.BreakingviewsReuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

In a country where there are almost as many guns as people, gun ownership is fiercely defended by firearms industry lobbyists and Republican politicians, who now control the Senate, the House of Representatives and the White House. In addition to the shooting at a baseball field in Alexandria, Virginia, a man dressed in a UPS uniform and armed with an  assault pistol  opened fire at a United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) package sorting hub in San Francisco, killing three people before turning the gun on himself, police said. Also, one man was shot outside a shopping center near a major sports arena in New York City on Wednesday but it was not immediately clear who opened fire or how badly the victim was hurt, police said. Despite the day's carnage, there was no immediate indication that President Donald Trump or his fellow Republicans would shift from their position protecting gun ownership rights. Pro-gun voters lean heavily toward the Republican Party.  Several House Republicans who attended a briefing following the shooting were asked by reporters about the need for gun control legislation. âEveryone was focused on the facts of the caseâ and what might be needed to enhance lawmakersâ security, said Republican Representative Barbara Comstock. The lawmakers did not indicate gun control was discussed. Immediately following mass shootings, politicians typically are hesitant to talk about partisan legislative matters. Aides to House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, whose panel would have jurisdiction, were asked if Wednesdayâs shootings showed the need for legislation. A reply from Goodlatte, provided by aides, said his âprayers are with Congressman Steve Scaliseâ and the others injured. Spokesmen for the National Rifle Association (NRA), the powerful pro-gun rights lobbying group and a Republican Party ally, were not immediately available for comment. Democrats, who generally, though not uniformly, are more aggressive about gun control laws, expressed concern following the Alexandria incident, in which Republican Representative Steve Scalise and several other people were shot.  There are too many guns on the street,  said Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat. Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent who sought the Democratic presidential nomination last year, said,  Weâve got to stop the violence.  Democratic Representative Tim Ryan, who described himself as a strong supporter of gun rights, told reporters that  does not mean we should not have universal background checks  to gauge gun buyers' mental health and to check on whether they are on terrorism watch lists.  It is entirely appropriate to ask those questions,  Ryan said of expanded gun control legislation. Many Republicans recently have opposed expanded background checks for gun buyers and limiting access to assault rifles. Scalise, the No. 3 Republican in the House, has worked to oppose new federal gun controls that he has seen as an assault on the U.S. Constitution's Second Amendment right to bear arms.  We don't expect the solutions to this issue ever to be found in the wake of a single tragedy no matter who is shot, no matter how horrific it is,  Dan Gross, president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, said in a telephone interview. Gun control groups are fighting federal legislation that would relax existing gun laws, especially after Republicans backed by the NRA fared well in last November's elections. The Republican-controlled House this year passed a bill making it harder for veterans who have been deemed mentally incompetent to be turned down for gun purchases. Gross said that despite the House vote, the measure  is not going anywhere in the Senate.  He also said gun control organizations have held back passage in Congress of legislation giving states with concealed weapons laws reciprocity in all other states. A year ago, Congress was in a gun control debate after the shooting deaths of 49 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida. Democrats ramped up their pro-gun control push, staging a filibuster in the Senate and a  sit-in  in the House to disrupt Republican-controlled proceedings. In the end, no legislation passed either chamber to tighten access to guns. Chelsea Parsons, vice president for guns and crime policy at the liberal Center for American Progress, noted however, that since the 2012 shooting in Connecticut resulting in the deaths of 20 first-graders and six staff members at an elementary school, several states have imposed new limits on gun sales.   There's going to come a breaking point in the disconnect between what Congress is willing to do and what the American people demand,  Parsons said.

Rosenworcel served as a commissioner for the regulator until the end of 2016 when lawmakers failed to take up her renomination under former President Barack Obama, handing Republicans a 2-1 majority on the five-seat commission. Rosenworcel did not immediately reply to a request for comment. The agency is working to reverse Obama-era regulations, including the former Democratic president's landmark 2015 net-neutrality rules prohibiting broadband providers from giving or selling access to certain internet services over others. Rosenworcel, a former FCC official and congressional aide, backed the net neutrality rules in 2015 and put a significant focus on the plight of children without access to broadband service. She showed an independent streak from then-FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler, who unsuccessfully sought approval for new rules to allow pay TV subscribers to ditch set-top boxes. In 2013, she also opposed allowing cellphone use in the air. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, tapped by Trump in January, has also said he wants to dismantle other significant regulations as part of a sweeping review he said would remove barriers to business and modernize rules. Pai has also proposed significant changes to local TV ownership limits and plans other changes to media regulations. If confirmed, Rosenworcel would join Democratic Commissioner Mignon Clyburn, whose term ends on June 30. It is not clear if Clyburn plans to stay on the commission. Industry and congressional officials also expect Trump to nominate Brendan Carr, a Republican who is currently general counsel at the FCC and an adviser to Pai, to an open seat. Republican Michael O'Rielly also serves on the panel. Democrats insisted Republicans had agreed in 2015 to reconfirm Rosenworcel as part of a deal to confirm O'Rielly. Republicans denied there was a deal but the standoff had delayed consideration of telecommunications legislation in the Senate. Pai would be forced to leave the commission if he is not reconfirmed by the end of the year.  Better late than never,  Senator Bill Nelson of Florida, a Democrat, said in a statement on Rosenworcel's nomination.  The Senate should now move quickly to confirm her and fulfill the promise that was made two years ago. ","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-fcc-idUSL1N1JB1KU"},

In a country where there are almost as many guns as people, gun ownership is fiercely defended by firearms industry lobbyists and Republican politicians, who now control the Senate, the House of Representatives and the White House. In addition to the shooting at a baseball field in Alexandria, Virginia, a man dressed in a UPS uniform and armed with an  assault pistol  opened fire at a United Parcel Service Inc package sorting hub in San Francisco, killing three people before turning the gun on himself, police said. Also, one man was shot outside a shopping center near a major sports arena in New York City on Wednesday but it was not immediately clear who opened fire or how badly the victim was hurt, police said. Despite the day's carnage, there was no immediate indication that President Donald Trump or his fellow Republicans would shift from their position protecting gun ownership rights. Pro-gun voters lean heavily toward the Republican Party. Several House Republicans who attended a briefing following the shooting were asked by reporters about the need for gun control legislation. âEveryone was focused on the facts of the caseâ and what might be needed to enhance lawmakersâ security, said Republican Representative Barbara Comstock. The lawmakers did not indicate gun control was discussed. Typically after mass shootings, politicians are hesitant to talk about partisan legislative matters. Aides to House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, whose panel would have jurisdiction, were asked if Wednesdayâs shootings showed the need for legislation. A reply from Goodlatte, provided by aides, said his âprayers are with Congressman Steve Scaliseâ and the others injured. Spokesmen for the National Rifle Association (NRA), the powerful pro-gun rights lobbying group and a Republican Party ally, were not immediately available for comment. Democrats, who generally, though not uniformly, are more aggressive about gun control laws, expressed concern following the Alexandria incident, in which Republican Representative Steve Scalise and several other people were shot.  There are too many guns on the street,  said Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat. Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent who sought the Democratic presidential nomination last year, said,  Weâve got to stop the violence.  Democratic Representative Tim Ryan, who described himself as a strong supporter of gun rights, told reporters that  does not mean we should not have universal background checks  to gauge gun buyers' mental health and to check on whether they are on terrorism watch lists.  It is entirely appropriate to ask those questions,  Ryan said of expanded gun control legislation. Many Republicans recently have opposed expanded background checks for gun buyers and limiting access to assault rifles. Scalise, the No. 3 Republican in the House, has worked to oppose new federal gun controls that he has seen as an assault on the U.S. Constitution's Second Amendment right to bear arms.

The new traffic routers can handle the greater demands of virtual reality programming, cloud-based internet services and next-generation mobile communications, the Finnish company said. Nokia's new products, which grew out of its 15.6 billion-euro ($17.5 billion) 2016 acquisition of Alcatel and its IP network gear business, should help it win business from companies such as Facebook (FB.O), Google (GOOGL.O), Apple (AAPL.O) and Amazon (AMZN.O). For these  web-scale  customers speed is everything and unlike Nokia's traditional telecoms customers they are still increasing spending on network gear. The routers are compatible with older products and will also serve Nokia's existing customers who want speed but must still contend with legacy gear needed to run existing services.  Nokia will have the highest-performance system capacity in the market, and a lot of those web-scalers, they just want speed,  Ray Mota, principal analyst at ACG Research, told Reuters.  The former Alcatel IP networks business is already the world's No. 2 player in edge routers behind Cisco, having displaced Juniper Networks, which is now No. 3.  The Nokia business also competes with Huawei [HWT.UL] in router markets outside the United States, where the privately-held Chinese firm is barred for national security reasons. Nokia executives expect to take market share from all the big competitors, including Cisco and Juniper as well as Huawei.  Whether its web-scale or vertical markets (such as banks, transportation, energy and public sector), where we have been less exposed in routers, clearly we will gain share,  Nokia Chief Executive Rajeev Suri told Reuters in an interview.   This gives us momentum in core routing.  Simon Leopold, a financial analyst with Raymond James, said Juniper, which depends for around a quarter of sales from web-scale customers such as Facebook could be hardest hit.  There is at least headline risk to Juniper, once Nokia ships,  he said. Shares of Juniper Networks fell 2.4 percent to $28.60, while Cisco fell 1 percent to $31.38. Nokia's U.S.-listed shares dipped a little under 1 percent. Petabits Nokia said it is introducing its latest FP4 silicon chipset capable of processing data at 2.4 terabits per second. The new chipsets are set to ship in the fourth quarter, with routers running FP4 chips ready in the first quarter of next year. These will be built into routers to operate both ultra high-speed  core  networks at the heart of the biggest internet services and also  edge  networks that link datacentres to front-line customer services on mobile or fixed-line networks. Telecom operators' capital spending is rising by just 2-3 percent a year which means Nokia is turning to web-scale players whose spending on new network gear is growing by double-digits. FP4 chips, which are manufactured for Nokia by Taiwan's TSMC (2330.TW) are designed using circuits as narrow as 16 nanometres apart, skipping 22- and 28-nanometer-sized circuits compared to the prior FP3 processor built at 40-nanometer scale, Nokia said.   Nokia is introducing the 7950 petabit-class router aimed at the core routing market to help it win business from customers such as Apple and Facebook. A petabit can transmit 5,000 two-hour-long high-definition videos every second.For edgeÂ networkÂ customers, Nokia is introducing its 7750 router, offering the highest traffic capacity on the market.  Mota said the Nokia 7750 can deliver speeds of up to 4.8 terabits per slot, compared with Juniper's 3 terabit edge router speeds, which had been the industry's fastest. A terabit can transfer a high-definition Netflix TV episode in one second. Beyond sheer speed, there is enough processing power head-room in its new chipset to offer built-in security features to fend off distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. BT (BT.L) managing director and chief network architect Neil McRae said the British telecoms operator, an early customer of Nokia's new products, is already running thousands of 7750 edge routers and hundreds of 7950 systems in its core network.  If you look at London, one of the busiest parts of our network, we need this platform today,  McRae said.

Despite inheriting Europe's fastest-growing economy, he will face immediate challenges in the shape of neighboring Britain's exit from the European Union, a political crisis in Northern Ireland and a housing crisis at home. Varadkar succeeded Enda Kenny earlier this month as leader of the Fine Gael party. Colleagues pinned their hopes of an unprecedented third term on the straight-talking Varadkar, who they believe can widen their appeal in elections that may be triggered as soon as next year.  Enda Kenny's leadership enabled me to become an equal citizen in my own country two short years ago and to aspire to hold this office, an aspiration I once thought was beyond my reach, at least if I chose to be myself,  Varadkar said in reference to Ireland's 2015 vote to legalize gay marriage.  The government I lead will not be one of left or right. The government I lead will be one of the new European center as we seek to build a Republic of opportunity, that is a Republic in which every citizen gets a fair go and in which every part of the country stands to share in our prosperity.  Varadkar's elevation marks another chapter in the social change that has swept through the country of 4.6 million people that only decriminalized homosexuality in 1993 and legalized divorce two years later.  As the country's youngest holder of this office, he speaks for a new generation of Irish women and Irish men, he represents a modern, diverse and inclusive Ireland and speaks for them like no other,  Kenny told parliament, nominating his successor. Policy Shifts Leo Varadkar is congratulated by colleagues as he leaves Government buildings after being elected by parliamentary vote as the next Prime Minister of Ireland (Taoiseach) to replace Enda Kenny in Dublin, Ireland June 14, 2017.Clodagh KilcoyneHowever it is his policies that will attract more scrutiny at home with opponents warning that the former health, tourism and social protection minister, who first joined the center-right party aged 17, would nudge it further to the right. While analysts expect few major policy shifts from Varadkar and his new cabinet, the new Fine Gael leader has hinted at some changes. He has pledged to introduce a less ambitious debt reduction target than the one set by Kenny's government last year, and to lobby the EU for additional leeway to free up more funding for badly needed infrastructure projects. On Brexit, he wants Northern Ireland, a British province, to remain in the EU's single market and retain access to as many EU programs as possible to ensure it secures a  soft  Brexit that he has said appears more likely following last week's British election. Varadkar told parliament on Wednesday that Ireland would hold a referendum next year on liberalizing Ireland's abortion laws, currently among the most restrictive in Europe.  European Council President Donald Tusk, tweeting words of congratulations in the Irish language, assured Varadkar that his fellow EU leaders shared a  great sensitivity  about the challenge the island of Ireland faces in the Brexit talks. Varadkar, who took his seat in parliament 10 years ago to the day on Wednesday, named Paschal Donohoe finance minister, replacing the retiring Michael Noonan. Donohoe will also retain his existing portfolio as public expenditure minister. Donohoe, 42, has managed budgetary policy with Noonan for the last year and was previously transport minister where he successfully negotiated the sale of the state's 30 percent stake in former flag carrier Aer Lingus to IAG. Varadkar also appointed his chief rival for the leadership, former housing minister Simon Coveney, as foreign minister.

Nokia will have the highest-performance system capacity in the market, and a lot of those web-scalers, they just want speed,  Ray Mota, principal analyst at ACG Research, told Reuters.  The former Alcatel IP networks business is already the world's No. 2 player in edge routers behind Cisco, having displaced Juniper Networks, which is now No. 3.  The Nokia business also competes with Huawei [HWT.UL] in router markets outside the United States, where the privately-held Chinese firm is barred for national security reasons. Nokia executives expect to take market share from all the big competitors, including Cisco and Juniper as well as Huawei.  Whether its web-scale or vertical markets (such as banks, transportation, energy and public sector), where we have been less exposed in routers, clearly we will gain share,  Nokia Chief Executive Rajeev Suri told Reuters in an interview.   This gives us momentum in core routing.  Simon Leopold, a financial analyst with Raymond James, said Juniper, which depends for around a quarter of sales from web-scale customers such as Facebook could be hardest hit.  There is at least headline risk to Juniper, once Nokia ships,  he said. Shares of Juniper Networks fell 2.4 percent to $28.60, while Cisco fell 1 percent to $31.38. Nokia's U.S.-listed shares dipped a little under 1 percent. Petabits Nokia said it is introducing its latest FP4 silicon chipset capable of processing data at 2.4 terabits per second. The new chipsets are set to ship in the fourth quarter, with routers running FP4 chips ready in the first quarter of next year. These will be built into routers to operate both ultra high-speed  core  networks at the heart of the biggest internet services and also  edge  networks that link datacentres to front-line customer services on mobile or fixed-line networks. Telecom operators' capital spending is rising by just 2-3 percent a year which means Nokia is turning to web-scale players whose spending on new network gear is growing by double-digits. FP4 chips, which are manufactured for Nokia by Taiwan's TSMC (2330.TW) are designed using circuits as narrow as 16 nanometres apart, skipping 22- and 28-nanometer-sized circuits compared to the prior FP3 processor built at 40-nanometer scale, Nokia said.   Nokia is introducing the 7950 petabit-class router aimed at the core routing market to help it win business from customers such as Apple and Facebook. A petabit can transmit 5,000 two-hour-long high-definition videos every second.For edgeÂ networkÂ customers, Nokia is introducing its 7750 router, offering the highest traffic capacity on the market.  Mota said the Nokia 7750 can deliver speeds of up to 4.8 terabits per slot, compared with Juniper's 3 terabit edge router speeds, which had been the industry's fastest. A terabit can transfer a high-definition Netflix TV episode in one second. Beyond sheer speed, there is enough processing power head-room in its new chipset to offer built-in security features to fend off distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. BT (BT.L) managing director and chief network architect Neil McRae said the British telecoms operator, an early customer of Nokia's new products, is already running thousands of 7750 edge routers and hundreds of 7950 systems in its core network.  If you look at London, one of the busiest parts of our network, we need this platform today,  McRae said.

The Institute of Medicine (now the National Academy of Medicine) says clinical practice guidelines should be based on a systematic review of the evidence, lead author Dr. Paul Shekelle from RAND Corporation in Santa Monica, California, told Reuters Health by email.  âWe know that clinical practice guidelines go out of date over time, as new evidence accumulates. An impediment to the regular updating of clinical practice guidelines is the time and resources needed to update the systematic review,â he said.  Typically, researchers and their assistants perform computer searches to identify anywhere from a few to thousands of new research studies, then they determine which ones are relevant and assemble the information into updated guidelines and recommendations.  Shekelle and colleagues thought machines could do more of the job and do it faster, so they compared machine-learning methods with the standard search methods for identifying new information.  They tested the idea on three health conditions: gout, low bone density and osteoarthritis of the knee. The smart search program âlearnedâ which key terms to look for by analyzing words from studies that were included in prior reviews on each topic. In all three cases, computers - provided only with the titles and summaries of articles included in previous reviews - reduced the number of articles researchers had to screen further by 67 to 83 percent, according to the results in Annals of Internal Medicine. The machine-learning method missed only two articles that humans would have identified, for an overall accuracy of 96 percent. And neither of these articles would have changed the ultimate evidence reviews, Shekelleâs team concludes. âMachine learning methods are very promising as a way to reduce the amount of time and effort for the literature search, which in turn should make it easier to update the systematic review, which in turn can facilitate keeping clinical practice guidelines up to date,â Shekelle said. The approach would âshorten the time from completion of research studies to adoption of effective treatments in clinical practice,â said Dr. Alfonso Iorio from McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, who coauthored an editorial accompanying the report. âAlso, it will allow more efficient update of doctors about what works and what does not, saving lives and dollars,â he said by email. Iorio thinks this method would have the greatest impact in the fields of cardiology, diabetes, respiratory disease and cancer. âBut any field would benefit,â he said.  âIn the near future, artificial intelligence will also be used to match to individual need with the best available health care intervention - one necessary step to get this is proper classification on existing and newly generated knowledge,â Iorio said.  âThe critical step is training properly the computer systems - we need to ensure research dollars are provided to ensure this training is done by serious and independent researchers and controlled by public institutions.â  SOURCE: bit.ly/2rslYlR and bit.ly/2rhBLA0 Annals of Internal Medicine, online June 13, 2017.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-ai-research-reviews-idUSKBN1952WR"},

Despite inheriting Europe's fastest-growing economy, he will face immediate challenges in the shape of neighboring Britain's exit from the European Union, a political crisis in Northern Ireland and a housing crisis at home. Varadkar succeeded Enda Kenny earlier this month as leader of the Fine Gael party. Colleagues pinned their hopes of an unprecedented third term on the straight-talking Varadkar, who they believe can widen their appeal in elections that may be triggered as soon as next year.  Enda Kenny's leadership enabled me to become an equal citizen in my own country two short years ago and to aspire to hold this office, an aspiration I once thought was beyond my reach, at least if I chose to be myself,  Varadkar said in reference to Ireland's 2015 vote to legalize gay marriage.  The government I lead will not be one of left or right. The government I lead will be one of the new European center as we seek to build a Republic of opportunity, that is a Republic in which every citizen gets a fair go and in which every part of the country stands to share in our prosperity.  Varadkar's elevation marks another chapter in the social change that has swept through the country of 4.6 million people that only decriminalized homosexuality in 1993 and legalized divorce two years later.  As the country's youngest holder of this office, he speaks for a new generation of Irish women and Irish men, he represents a modern, diverse and inclusive Ireland and speaks for them like no other,  Kenny told parliament, nominating his successor. Policy Shifts Leo Varadkar is congratulated by colleagues as he leaves Government buildings after being elected by parliamentary vote as the next Prime Minister of Ireland (Taoiseach) to replace Enda Kenny in Dublin, Ireland June 14, 2017.Clodagh KilcoyneHowever it is his policies that will attract more scrutiny at home with opponents warning that the former health, tourism and social protection minister, who first joined the center-right party aged 17, would nudge it further to the right. While analysts expect few major policy shifts from Varadkar and his new cabinet, the new Fine Gael leader has hinted at some changes. He has pledged to introduce a less ambitious debt reduction target than the one set by Kenny's government last year, and to lobby the EU for additional leeway to free up more funding for badly needed infrastructure projects. On Brexit, he wants Northern Ireland, a British province, to remain in the EU's single market and retain access to as many EU programs as possible to ensure it secures a  soft  Brexit that he has said appears more likely following last week's British election. Varadkar told parliament on Wednesday that Ireland would hold a referendum next year on liberalizing Ireland's abortion laws, currently among the most restrictive in Europe.  European Council President Donald Tusk, tweeting words of congratulations in the Irish language, assured Varadkar that his fellow EU leaders shared a  great sensitivity  about the challenge the island of Ireland faces in the Brexit talks. Varadkar, who took his seat in parliament 10 years ago to the day on Wednesday, named Paschal Donohoe finance minister, replacing the retiring Michael Noonan. Donohoe will also retain his existing portfolio as public expenditure minister. Donohoe, 42, has managed budgetary policy with Noonan for the last year and was previously transport minister where he successfully negotiated the sale of the state's 30 percent stake in former flag carrier Aer Lingus to IAG. Varadkar also appointed his chief rival for the leadership, former housing minister Simon Coveney, as foreign minister.

Rosenworcel served as a commissioner for the regulator until the end of 2016 when lawmakers failed to take up her renomination under former President Barack Obama, handing Republicans a 2-1 majority on the five-seat commission. Rosenworcel did not immediately reply to a request for comment. The agency is working to reverse Obama-era regulations, including the former Democratic president's landmark 2015 net-neutrality rules prohibiting broadband providers from giving or selling access to certain internet services over others. Rosenworcel, a former FCC official and congressional aide, backed the net neutrality rules in 2015 and put a significant focus on the plight of children without access to broadband service. She showed an independent streak from then-FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler, who unsuccessfully sought approval for new rules to allow pay TV subscribers to ditch set-top boxes. In 2013, she also opposed allowing cellphone use in the air. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, tapped by Trump in January, has also said he wants to dismantle other significant regulations as part of a sweeping review he said would remove barriers to business and modernize rules. Pai has also proposed significant changes to local TV ownership limits and plans other changes to media regulations.     If confirmed, Rosenworcel would join Democratic Commissioner Mignon Clyburn, whose term ends on June 30. It is not clear if Clyburn plans to stay on the commission.  Industry and congressional officials also expect Trump to nominate Brendan Carr, a Republican who is currently general counsel at the FCC and an adviser to Pai, to an open seat. Republican Michael O'Rielly also serves on the panel. Democrats insisted Republicans had agreed in 2015 to reconfirm Rosenworcel as part of a deal to confirm O'Rielly. Republicans denied there was a deal but the standoff had delayed consideration of telecommunications legislation in the Senate. Pai would be forced to leave the commission if he is not reconfirmed by the end of the year.  Better late than never,  Senator Bill Nelson of Florida, a Democrat, said in a statement on Rosenworcel's nomination.  The Senate should now move quickly to confirm her and fulfill the promise that was made two years ago.

The bank, under pressure to act as home prices soared in Toronto and Vancouver, switched to a hawkish stance this week, just a few months after saying that additional rate cuts were on the table.  Clearly the housing market is a factor there and they want to make sure that it doesn't get out of hand,  said Benjamin Tal, senior economist at CIBC Capital Markets.     Canada's 5-year government bond yield has jumped as much as 20 basis points, which could trigger higher mortgage borrowing costs, since Senior Deputy Governor Carolyn Wilkins spoke on Monday. The Canadian dollar is on track to post its biggest gain this week since early April.  Wilkins' speech was followed by a radio interview with Governor Stephen Poloz on Tuesday, in which he reinforced the message that higher rates are coming due to strengthening of the domestic economy. A spokeswoman for the central bank said it did not have anything to add to this week's comments by Wilkins and Poloz. But the housing market has become a bigger priority for the central bank as house prices in the Greater Toronto Area, Canada's biggest market, accelerated by more than 30 percent in April. Last week, in its semi-annual Financial System Review, the central bank pointed to the housing markets in Toronto and Vancouver and said there is an  increased likelihood of a price correction that could lead to financial stress.  Also, an earlier start to hiking could allow the central bank to proceed at a more gradual pace.  The number one risk about housing is not the magnitude but the speed of hiking. If you go slowly ... you allow the market to adjust,  Tal said. The Bank of Canada has kept its policy rate at or below one percent since 2009 in an effort to stimulate an economy that had struggled to gain traction since the global financial crisis. But house prices have more than doubled over the period in  Toronto and Vancouver, and there has been a rise in a closely watched measure of a country's vulnerability to debt, the household debt-to-income ratio. Data on Wednesday showed that the ratio, while edging down to 166.9 percent in the first quarter, held near a record high.  I've long since believed that policy has been too loose for too long  said Doug Porter, chief economist at BMO Capital Markets.  Even with inflation somewhat below target, the reality is that there are other risks (such as overborrowing) that can pop.  The central bank has preferred to rely on macroprudential measures to cool the housing market, such as tighter mortgage rules introduced last year. Ontario's red-hot market has showed signs of slowing after the province recently introduced a non-resident speculation tax. But the slowdown may be short-lived if not accompanied by higher rates. Higher bond yields, if sustained, will drive Canadian mortgage rates higher, said James Laird, president of CanWise Financial, which is a mortgage brokerage owned and operated by RateHub Inc, a financial product comparison website. Data from RateHub shows that Canada's discounted 5-year mortgage rate sits at a near historic low of 2.24 percent. A rise in borrowing costs will reduce the size of mortgages that borrowers will qualify for.  The Bank of Canada is trying to influence expectations to reduce excessive risk taking,  said Carlos Capistran, âhead of Canada and Mexico economics at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.

The Fed on Wednesday increased borrowing costs for the second time this year, while acknowledging the recent moderation in inflation pressures. Policymakers continued to expect the economy to expand at a  moderate  pace and labor market conditions to  strengthen somewhat  further.  The latest inflation data have undoubtedly helped the case of officials arguing for waiting more than three months for the next move,  said Jim O'Sullivan, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, New York.  The Labor Department said its Consumer Price Index dipped 0.1 percent last month, weighed down by declining prices for gasoline, apparel, airline fares, motor vehicles, communication and medical care services, among others.  The second drop in the CPI in three months followed a 0.2 percent rise in April. In the 12 months through May, the CPI rose 1.9 percent, the smallest increase since last November, after advancing 2.2 percent in April. The year-on-year gain in the CPI in May was still larger than the 1.6 percent average annual increase over the past 10 years. Economists had forecast the CPI unchanged last month and advancing 2.0 percent from a year ago.

The Fed has a 2 percent inflation target and tracks an inflation measure which is currently at 1.5 percent. The Fed said on Wednesday it expected annual inflation rates to  remain somewhat  below 2 percent in the near term but stabilize around the central bank's target over the medium term. Chair Janet Yellen said they were monitoring inflation developments closely.  The Fed hiked its benchmark overnight interest rate by 25 basis points to range of 1.00 percent to 1.25 percent, and said it would start reducing its $4.2 trillion portfolio of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities this year.

Prices for U.S. Treasuries rallied, while stocks on Wall Street were little changed. Eyes on Inflation  Economists say the weakness in inflation, if sustained, could put further monetary tightening in jeopardy.  Clearly officials will be mindful of incoming inflation trends in the coming months before greater confidence can be made with second half of the year policy normalization plans,  said Sam Bullard, a senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. In a separate report, the Commerce Department said retail sales fell 0.3 percent last month amid declining purchases of motor vehicles and discretionary spending after a 0.4 percent increase in April. May's drop was the largest since January 2016 and confounded economists' expectations for a 0.1 percent gain.      Retail sales rose 3.8 percent in May on a year-on-year basis. While some of the drop in monthly retail sales reflected lower gasoline prices, which weighed on receipts at service stations, sales at electronics and appliance stores recorded their biggest decline since March 2010.  Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and foodservices, retail sales were unchanged last month after an upwardly revised 0.6 percent rise in April. These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product and were previously reported to have increased 0.2 percent in April. Consumer spending accounts for more than two-thirds of the U.S. economy. Despite last month's weak core retail sales reading, low inflation could translate into higher consumer spending in the calculation of GDP. The economy grew at a 1.2 percent annualized rate in the first quarter, held back by a near stall in consumer spending and a slower pace of inventory investment. Output increased at a 2.1 percent pace in the October-December period. The Atlanta Fed is forecasting GDP rising at a 3.2 percent annualized rate in the second quarter.

Spot gold        fell 0.2 percent at $1,263.03 an ounce by 3:10 p.m. EDT (1910 GMT), while U.S. gold futures        for August delivery settled up 0.6 percent at $1,275.90 prior to the Fed's statement.      Overall, nothing here to change our forecasts for another hike in September and then the balance sheet unwind to start later in December, given little apparent concern regarding the recent weak data,  said Andrew Grantham, senior economist at CIBC Economics.     Bullion rallied earlier when data showed an unexpected month-on-month drop in U.S. consumer prices and retail sales, suggesting inflation pressures are moderating, which stoked expectations that Fed rate policy would remain cautious.                  The metal peaked at $1,279.37 as the dollar index fell to its lowest since Nov. 9 following the data.                 Gold is highly sensitive to rising U.S. interest rates, which lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion, while boosting the dollar.       The FOMC's decision to execute its normalization plan despite recent soft economic data has forced gold to retreat after its earlier exaggerated rally,  said Tai Wong, director of base and precious metals trading for BMO Capital Markets in New York.      The Fed still sees one more hike in 2017 and will start to reduce its balance sheet nodding to strong growth and employment while acknowledging soft inflation.      Silver        was up 0.4 percent at $16.93 an ounce while platinum       , which hit a near one-month low of $918.50 on Tuesday, was up 1.8 percent at $939.80 an ounce. Palladium       , which hit a 16-year high last week at $914.70, was down 2.4 percent at $861.40 an ounce.      The palladium price is expected to see a correction in the short term after the exaggerated increase in the last few weeks,  Commerzbank said in a note.       Afterwards the palladium price should rise to $850 per troy ounce by year-end due to the expected large supply deficit and the positive price trend in precious metals in general.

At a ceremony commemorating the 77th anniversary of the first transport of prisoners who entered the Auschwitz-Birkenau camp, Szydlo said that  Auschwitz is a lesson showing that everything needs to be done to protect one's citizens . The comments caused widespread outrage with many taking them as a defense of the Polish nationalist-minded Law and Justice (PiS) party government's decision not to accept any refugees under a European Union resettlement plan.  The European Commission opened a legal case on Tuesday against three eastern EU members, including Poland, for failing to take in asylum-seekers to relieve EU states on the front lines of the bloc's migration crisis.

Former Defence Minister Tomasz Siemoniak said in a tweet that Szydlo's remarks were a  discredit .  Szydlo's words first appeared in a tweet by PiS that has since been removed. Rafal Bochenek, the government's spokesman, said that people should listen to the entire speech of the prime minister before making any judgment. In the speech, Szydlo said it was a great task for politicians to make sure that  such terrible events as those that took place in Auschwitz and other places of martyrdom never happen again . More than a million people, mainly European Jews, were gassed, shot or hanged at the camp, or died of neglect, starvation or disease, before the Soviet Red Army entered its gates in early 1945 during its decisive advance on Germany.

The room erupted,  OpenDoor Chief Executive Officer Susan Estes said in an interview.  The ideal trade on our platform happened on the very first trade.  In six weeks since that launch, OpenDoor has taken in around $60 billion worth of orders for  off-the-run  U.S. Treasury bonds, those issued before the most recent offering, along with inflation-protected securities, or TIPS. Around $2.5 billion in trades have been matched. Liquidity in off-the-runs has declined in recent years, with post-financial crisis regulations requiring banks to hold more capital and pull back from market-making activities. That has made it harder and more expensive for investors to buy or sell off-the-run Treasuries, which comprise 98 percent of the $13.8 trillion U.S. Treasury market but less than one-third of average daily volumes.  The majority of volume is now concentrated in on-the-runs, with a reasonable amount traded by bots,  Estes said, referring to automated trading. Off-the-run volumes are about where they were 13 or 14 years ago, even though the overall market is now three times as large, she said. OpenDoor is trying to solve the liquidity problem by bringing buyers and sellers together and automating a process that has historically been low-tech. Typically, a portfolio manager interested in a particular Treasury issue will call a large Wall Street bond dealer like JPMorgan Chase & Co or Goldman Sachs Group Inc and ask for a price. Dealers then scour the market and come back with a quote that includes an extra spread on top of the market price, so they can collect income on the trade. OpenDoor automates that process so pension funds, hedge funds, insurance companies, trading companies, central banks and dealers can trade anonymously with each other in blind auctions. OpenDoor charges a transaction fee to end-users to participate, but its transaction analysis has shown that buyers and sellers are getting better prices than they would with traditional methods, said Estes, who previously ran Treasury desks at Deutsche Bank AG and Morgan Stanley. So far, six dealers are trading on OpenDoor for their own accounts, along with financial institutions representing $6.5 trillion in assets under management (AUM), she said. Another three dealers and accounts representing $14 trillion in AUM are in the final stages of connecting. Order sizes on OpenDoor are averaging nearly $60 million and trades are averaging north of $25 million, with the busiest day volume-wise at $650 million, she said.

The lawyers asked the court to postpone the trial until Nabeel Rajab, hospitalised since April, could attend and defend himself, the Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy (BIRD) said.  Rajab's health had deteriorated in solitary confinement, the institute said, and he has undergone surgery for bleeding ulcers.  When Judge Al-Jazar refused the postponement request, the defence declared they were withdrawing from court until their client could attend in person and walked out of the court room,  BIRD said in a statement. A leading figure in a 2011 pro-democracy uprising led by Bahrain's Shi'ite Muslim majority, Rajab has been repeatedly detained. He faced two trials on Wednesday, one in the morning for tweeting, the other in the afternoon for spreading false news. He also faces another trial on charges of writing an editorial decrying prison conditions in the country. BIRD's statement said the trial for tweeting has been postponed until Aug. 7 and the trial for spreading false news has been delayed to July 2.  The government had no immediate comment on the report.  In a New York Times column published under his byline in September, Rajab addressed readers in the first person, saying he was writing from a  Bahraini jail cell where I have been detained, largely in isolation, since the beginning of summer . The United Nations Committee against Torture last month called on Bahrain to release Rajab from more than nine months of solitary confinement and investigate widespread allegations of ill-treatment and torture of detainees. Bahrain denies any systematic abuse by police or in its prisons and says it is facing a violent uprising backed by its regional rival, Iran.

The U.S. central bank cited continued U.S. economic growth and job market strength, proceeding with its first tightening cycle in more than a decade. The Fed also said it will begin cutting holdings of bonds and other securities this year.  I donât think that there is really too much new in here outside of the fact that the Fed remains committed to the slow gradual normalization process despite some of the weak data that weâve had,  said Mark Cabana, head of U.S. short rates strategy at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in New York. U.S. consumer prices unexpectedly fell in May and retail sales recorded their biggest drop in 16 months, data showed on Wednesday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 9.45 points, or 0.04 percent, to 21,319.02, the S&P; 500 lost 9.19 points, or 0.38 percent, to 2,431.16 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 55.77 points, or 0.9 percent, to 6,164.60. The Fed clearly outlined a plan to reduce its $4.2 trillion portfolio of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, most of which were purchased in the wake of the 2007-2009 financial crisis and recession.  The market should take confidence in the fact that theyâre being very transparent in setting clear policy steps in terms of how they normalize the balance sheet,  said Heidi Learner, chief economist for Savills Studley, a unit of Savills Plc, in New York.  Certainly more transparency is a good thing.  The energy sector was down nearly 2 percent as oil prices weakened. U.S. data showed an unexpectedly large weekly build in U.S. gasoline inventories and International Energy Agency (IEA) data projected a big increase in non-OPEC output in 2018. The technology sector fell 1.2 percent, with Apple off 1.6 percent. Tech stocks have led the S&P; 500's nearly 9 percent rally this year, but have faltered in recent days. In corporate news, Alexion was up 8 percent after the biotechnology company named Biogen's chief financial officer as its CFO. Biogen's stock was down 3.5 percent. H & R Block was the biggest percentage gainer on the S&P; 500, rising 8.4 percent after the tax preparation service posted quarterly revenue and profit that beat analysts' expectations. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the New York Stock Exchange by a 1.35-to-1 ratio, while on Nasdaq, a 1.72-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The U.S. central bank lifted the benchmark lending rate by a quarter percentage point and its policy-setting committee indicated the economy has been expanding moderately, according to a statement following a two-day meeting. U.S. Treasury yields edged up but remained lower on the day, with the Fed sticking to its plan to raise rates again this year and detailing plans to reduce its $4.5 trillion balance sheet. Traders said the Fed might not be able to hike later this year as forecast given weak inflation data. Data earlier Wednesday showed U.S. consumer prices unexpectedly fell in May, suggesting a softening in domestic demand.  It just looks like the Fed is sticking to their story and the market remains highly skeptical that the Fed is going to be able to deliver just based upon underlying data. I would think that at some point the market is going to be pricing in even greater risks that the Fed might be moving too quickly,  said Mark Cabana, head of U.S. short rates strategy at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in New York. U.S. short-term interest rate futures pared earlier gains after the Fed's hike. Traders now see June next year as the earliest meeting at which the U.S. central bank will next lift its target for overnight borrowing costs, based on fed funds futures traded at CME Group as analyzed by Reuters. The dollar index fell 0.11 percent, with the euro up 0.04 percent to $1.1219. The Japanese yen strengthened 0.55 percent versus the greenback at 109.49 per dollar, while sterling was last trading at $1.2751, up 0.01 percent on the day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 9.3 points, or 0.04 percent, to 21,319.17, the S&P; 500 lost 9.38 points, or 0.38 percent, to 2,430.97 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 56.39 points, or 0.91 percent, to 6,163.98. Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes were up 20/32 in price to yield 2.1377 percent, from 2.207 percent late on Tuesday. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index lost 0.35 percent and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.24 percent. Energy sector shares were the biggest drag on the S&P; 500, tracking a slide in crude oil prices. Oil prices tumbled after data showing an unexpectedly large buildup in gasoline stockpiles. U.S. crude fell 3.7 percent to settle at $44.73 per barrel and Brent was last at $46.99, down 3.5 percent. Gold rose after the weaker-than-expected U.S. data knocked the dollar. Spot gold added 0.2 percent to $1,267.44 an ounce. U.S. gold futures gained 0.07 percent to $1,269.50 an ounce. Copper lost 0.87 percent to $5,667.00 a tonne.

Key Points: The decision lifted the U.S. central bank's benchmark lending rate by a quarter percentage point to a target range of 1.00 percent to 1.25 percent as it proceeds with its first tightening cycle in more than a decade. The Fed gave a clear outline on its plan to reduce its $4.2 trillion portfolio of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, most of which were purchased in the wake of the 2007-2009 financial crisis and recession. Comments:  KRISTINA HOOPER, GLOBAL MARKET STRATEGIST AT INVESCO LTD IN NEW YORK âThis is what I expected â that the Fed would be in something of a hurry to get out plans for balance sheet normalization in advance of any changes in FOMC membership, but that we likely wonât see the start of implementation until the fourth quarter. And as I expected, the Fed will be slowly and carefully normalizing. Whatâs perhaps most noteworthy is that the Fed has taken its data dependent monetary policy with regards to the fed funds rate and extended it to balance sheet normalization â note the sentence in the Addendum to the Policy Normalization Principles and Plans:  MICHAEL PURVES, CHIEF GLOBAL STRATEGIST AT WEEDEN & CO IN NEW YORK  When you look at the Fed statement and you think about how the recent data has been trending and you think about the market reaction, the core question is does the Fed really change their narrative aggressively. Not today so much but do we start seeing a much more dovish narrative going forward? Because it's going to be really hard to defend some of the things that they have put in this statement, if in fact the data doesn't start getting better soon.  A couple of weeks ago (Fed Governor) Lael Brainard gave a speech that was very much of the view that we are not seeing the inflation necessary to really talk seriously about a balance sheet reduction any time soon. That, sort of more fringe narrative, is going to go mainstream. JOE MANIMBO, SENIOR MARKET ANALYST, WESTERN UNION BUSINESS SOLUTIONS, WASHINGTON âThe U.S. dollar cut session losses after the Fed raised rates...  and signaled another rate increase before the end of the year. Ahead of the Fedâs decision, the broadly weighted U.S. dollar index had fallen to fresh lows for the year after disappointing news on the U.S. economy cast doubt on further rate increases. While the Fed noted the recent slowing in inflation that was evident in todayâs consumer price index, the bankâs forecasts for the economy maintained confidence in its underlying strength. The Fed revised up slightly its forecasts for growth this year while it nudged down its predictions for unemployment and inflation. The Fed chairâs comments at the bottom of the hour are also likely to impact currencies. The Fedâs glass half full assessment of the U.S. economy should support the dollar. But if the Fedâs view should prove overly optimistic the dollar would be at risk of deepening its recent losses.â HEIDI LEARNER, CHIEF ECONOMIST, NEW YORK, SAVILLS STUDLEY, SAVILLS PLC âThe market should take confidence in the fact that theyâre being very transparent in setting clear policy steps in terms of how they normalize the balance sheet. Certainly more transparency is a good thing. âAfter this morningâs dip in CPI to 1.7 percent from 2.3 percent year on year at the beginning of the year, it would be hard for them not to adjust that down, the same thing about their changes to the unemployment rate, the dip down for 2018, 2019 has to reflect the fact weâre already at 4.3 percent. âI would have liked to see some mention about the extent to which theyâre concerned about the decline in inflation. Thatâs probably behind Kashkariâs dissent in terms in wanting to keep rates where they were, but they didnât seem terribly worried.  âIf you look at the fact that now weâve had two rate hikes this year, you could argue weâve gone from 2.6 percent in 10-year Treasuries, now down to almost 2.10 percent, so that 50 basis points increase weâve had in Fed Funds has been equal to the decline in 10-year Treasury yields. So clearly the flattening of the yield curve here suggests maybe not as much growth or not as much tightening as would have been the case.  BRETT RYAN, SENIOR U.S. ECONOMIST, DEUTSCHE BANK, NEW YORK:  The fact that they kept the interest rate trajectory the same is not surprising. Despite the weak inflation prints recently they are not reexamining or rethinking the path of rates just yet. We did get more details than expected on reinvestment tapering but they were in line with what we were expecting.   They upgraded their level of concern about inflation by stating that the committee is monitoring the inflation  closely.  To the backdrop, they lowered inflation forecasts in the summer of economic projections by 0.3 pct in the headline and 0.2 percent in the core. That sets a low bar to get to their forecast target by year-end. As long as your core PCE is on track to hit 1.7 percent, market participants should expect another rate hike by the end of this year.  In terms of our forecast, nothing really has changed. We still think in September they take a pause. They announce implementation of taper. They could hike at that time, but we think they probably pause then and then hike in December assuming things go well.  They did a good job communicating.  The market is still underpricing 2018 and 2019 well below where the Fed thinks things are going to be in terms of rates.      MARK CABANA, HEAD OF U.S. SHORT RATES STRATEGY AT BANK OF AMERICA MERRILL LYNCH IN NEW YORK: âI donât think that there is really too much new in here outside of the fact that the Fed remains committed to the slow gradual normalization process despite some of the weak data that weâve had. It just looks like the Fed is sticking to their story and the market remains highly skeptical that the Fed is going to be able to deliver just based upon underlying data. I would think that at some point the market is going to be pricing in even greater risks that the Fed might be moving too quickly, and weâve certainly seen some of that price action over recent days with yields falling and inflation breakevens moving lower, but for now it seems like the Fed is pretty committed to stay on their path.â DAN IVASCYN, GROUP CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER AT PACIFIC INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT CO, NEWPORT BEACH, CALIF:  âThe statement was slightly on the hawkish side. I think itâs just how Central Banks speak. I think that, more important, arguably today was the weakness of the retail and inflation data. As our economist pointed out, thereâs a trend and signs of weakening in the harder data. Thereâs some pressure on inflation and we think the Fed is going to take note of this weaker data. The reality is that they are going to be data-dependent and we remain cautious on interest-rate risk, but weâre not massively selling bonds here. Be careful not to be bearish on this statement.â BILL NORTHEY, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, US BANK WEALTH MANAGEMENT, HELENA, MONTANA  The muted market reaction thus far I think thatâs what is standing out to me. âNotably as Iâm looking down through the adjustments that were made â¦ the PCE inflation expectations for 2017 have been materially ratcheted down from 1.9 to 1.6 percent. Thatâs notable because that indicates that the Fed is viewing that thereâs less inflation in the system and would look at this as a relatively dovish hike.â âTo the extent that this is viewed as a materially dovish hike we could see a little bit more weakness in the dollar.â âWhen youâre looking at lower levels of inflation and potentially a Fed that may have to take a somewhat slower path toward policy rate normalization that could allow rates to stay lower for a longer period of time across the Treasury curve and continue to provide more accommodation, things that have been positive from an equity markets perspective. Certainly valuations across the equity market complex are full at this time and aided by low interest rates and low inflation.â Kully Samra, Uk Managing Director at Charles Schwab, Said: âAn interest rate rise today was highly expected and shows the Fed continues to be confident in moving toward normalizing monetary policy. Despite recent underwhelming jobs numbers, the underlying US economic data remains robust enough to warrant tightening.  âWhile the economy is bouncing back from a weak first quarter, earnings have been strong and even in the wake of continued political uncertainty, corporate confidence remains secure. The market has demonstrated that it is comfortable with gradual rate hikes and will be reassured that the Fed has today committed to its promises. We expect at least one more rate hike this year but incoming data will influence future decisions.â  âThe next step for the Fed will be to reduce its balance sheet and stocks could experience bouts of volatility in the coming months due to both political surprises and Fed policy communications. The bull market still has legs, but investors should be aware that risks are elevated.â  BRENT SCHUTTE, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST AT NORTHWESTERN MUTUAL WEALTH MANAGEMENT IN MILWAUKEE, WISCONSIN  âThis one was priced in by the market and even with the weaker inflation data today everyone still expected the Fed to hike rates because the market had given them the green light to do so. There is a lot of information also to digest in this one with the balance sheet reduction and some slight tweaks to the language. But in general the underlying economic backdrop, in my mind, supports what they did today. The funny thing is the retail sales data was actually decent. Everybody forgets to look at the revisions and if you look at the revisions for the last two months they were actually up quite a bit. So you have retail sales which actually now are additive to second-quarter GDP.   Everybody is fixated on the inflation data and it is a little bit of a mystery. But in general you are at this point in the economic cycle where unemployment is, where qualified workers are hard to find. The textbook says that inflation should rise, the question is if this time is different. We still believe supply and demand works and because there is not much supply of labor and a ton of demand, wages will rise and the way companies will pay for those wages is through rising prices which will translate to rising inflation in the future.â  RICH TAYLOR, PORTFOLIO MANAGER AT AMERICAN CENTURY INVESTMENTS IN MOUNTAIN VIEW CALIFORNIA  The big takeaways were as expected. What is noteworthy is that today Yellen laid out the balance sheet reduction plan with a lot more detail.   Obviously with the big drop off in inflation this morning, which was a bit of a surprise, and the recent softening of economic data in general, it certainly gave the Fed pause with regards to September.   The market's not reacting much because the 25 basis point increase was widely expected.   In the bond market we're still range bound. For investors itâs still a yield grab in the credit markets even though the credit markets are very expensive. Bond investors don't have to worry about significantly higher rates for quite a while.   There's too many headwinds on the economic and geopolitical front to take up interest rates out of the recent range any time soon.   We still think there's one more 25 basis point move, obviously data dependent but it might not happen until December if we continue to get soft inflation data.  BRIAN JACOBSEN, CHIEF PORTFOLIO STRATEGIST AT WELLS FARGO FUNDS MANAGEMENT IN MENOMONEE FALLS, WISCONSIN âThe FOMC met expectations and delivered a dovish hike. Itâs dovish in that they acknowledge the data has softened and they havenât dismissed the weaker inflation readings as being merely transitory. While the base case can be for another rate hike this year, itâs not unthinkable that they could just pause until September or even December to get the âcoast is clearâ signal on inflation. âThe balance sheet reduction plan is so mild and mechanical that it shouldnât be an issue for the longer-dated Treasury or MBS markets. They stormed into the room with QE and are tiptoeing out almost unnoticed.â GENNADIY GOLDBERG, INTEREST RATE STRATEGIST, TD SECURITIES, NEW YORK âGenerally speaking this does seem like a more hawkish statement. The Fed announcing an update to their reinvestment principles leaves September open (for) the start of balance sheet runoff, and the fact that they havenât slowed their projected path of rate hikes suggest they can do both balance sheet and rate hikes at the same time.â Market Reaction:  STOCKS: Stocks moved slightly higher then flattened. The S&P; 500 .SPX was last down 0.2 percent after being down 0.06 percent just before the decision.  BONDS: U.S. Treasury yields briefly fall, then retrace and edge higher.  FOREX: The U.S. dollar index pared earlier losses.   Reporting by Megan Davies","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fed-instant-idUSKBN1952PZ"},

The second drop in the CPI in three months followed a 0.2 percent rise in April. In the 12 months through May, the CPI rose 1.9 percent, the smallest increase since last November, after advancing 2.2 percent in April. The year-on-year gain in the CPI in May was still larger than the 1.6 percent average annual increase over the past 10 years. Economists had forecast the CPI unchanged last month and advancing 2.0 percent from a year ago.

The core CPI increased 1.7 percent year-on-year, the smallest rise since May 2015, after advancing 1.9 percent in April.  The Fed has a 2 percent inflation target and tracks an inflation measure which is currently at 1.5 percent. The Fed said on Wednesday it expected annual inflation rates to  remain somewhat  below 2 percent in the near term but stabilize around the central bank's target over the medium term. Chair Janet Yellen said they were monitoring inflation developments closely.  The Fed hiked its benchmark overnight interest rate by 25 basis points to range of 1.00 percent to 1.25 percent, and said it would start reducing its $4.2 trillion portfolio of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities this year.

Prices for U.S. Treasuries rallied, while stocks on Wall Street were little changed. Eyes on Inflation  Economists say the weakness in inflation, if sustained, could put further monetary tightening in jeopardy.  Clearly officials will be mindful of incoming inflation trends in the coming months before greater confidence can be made with second half of the year policy normalization plans,  said Sam Bullard, a senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. In a separate report, the Commerce Department said retail sales fell 0.3 percent last month amid declining purchases of motor vehicles and discretionary spending after a 0.4 percent increase in April. May's drop was the largest since January 2016 and confounded economists' expectations for a 0.1 percent gain.      Retail sales rose 3.8 percent in May on a year-on-year basis. While some of the drop in monthly retail sales reflected lower gasoline prices, which weighed on receipts at service stations, sales at electronics and appliance stores recorded their biggest decline since March 2010.  Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and foodservices, retail sales were unchanged last month after an upwardly revised 0.6 percent rise in April. These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product and were previously reported to have increased 0.2 percent in April. Consumer spending accounts for more than two-thirds of the U.S. economy. Despite last month's weak core retail sales reading, low inflation could translate into higher consumer spending in the calculation of GDP. The economy grew at a 1.2 percent annualized rate in the first quarter, held back by a near stall in consumer spending and a slower pace of inventory investment. Output increased at a 2.1 percent pace in the October-December period. The Atlanta Fed is forecasting GDP rising at a 3.2 percent annualized rate in the second quarter.

Royal Bank of Canada (RY.TO), Bank of Montreal (BMO.TO) and Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD.TO) are among the Canadian lenders  that are expected to be part of the syndicate, the people said on condition of anonymity as the talks were confidential.  The new loan will be on much more favorable terms than the existing C$2 billion loan provided by the Healthcare of Ontario Pension Plan (HOOPP), which came with an effective interest rate of 22.5 percent on the first C$1 billion drawn down, the people said. Shares in Home Capital rose as much as 5.9 percent following Reuters report, having been down by 5.4 percent prior to the Reuters story.  Home Capital has held talks with each of the country's biggest six banks, but not all are expected to participate, the sources said.  Credit Suisse (CSGN.S), Goldman Sachs (GS.N) and other international banks are also in discussions with Home Capital, and it is possible that a global bank may be part of the syndicate, they said. Depositors have withdrawn 95 percent of funds from Home Capital's high interest savings accounts since March 27, when the company terminated the employment of former Chief Executive Martin Reid.  The withdrawals accelerated after April 19, when Canada's biggest securities regulator, the Ontario Securities Commission, accused Home Capital of making misleading statements to investors about its mortgage underwriting business. The company has said the accusations are without merit. The rate of withdrawals from savings accounts have slowed since the middle of May. The company's Guaranteed Investment Certificate (GIC) deposits, a key source of funding, have also stabilized after initial declines. That has helped strengthen the lender's hand as it targets new sources of long-term funding, sources say. Talks over the possible loan have taken place for more than two weeks, they added. Home Capital is seeking an interest rate of 2 to 3 percent above the cost of funds though it is not clear if it will manage to secure a loan within that preferred range, the people said. Home Capital declined to comment.  RBC, Toronto-Dominion Bank, Credit Suisse and Goldman Sachs also declined to comment. BMO did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Home Capital, which hired RBC and BMO in April to advise on its strategic options, provides loans to borrowers, such as self-employed workers or newcomers to Canada, who may not meet the strict criteria of the country's biggest banks.  Concerns about Home Capital and overheating housing markets in Toronto and Vancouver had led to concerns about problems spreading within Canada's banking system, causing shares in the financial sector to fall to a 5-month low in May. Last month, rival mortgage provider Equitable Group Inc (EQB.TO) secured a C$2 billion loan from Canada's biggest six banks - RBC, TD, BMO, Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS.TO), Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CM.TO) and National Bank of Canada (NA.TO). The terms of that loan included an interest rate on drawn funds equal to the banks' cost of funds plus 1.25 percent, a 0.75 percent commitment fee and a 0.50 percent standby charge  on undrawn funds. Over time, Home Capital hopes to land a loan closer to the terms that Equitable secured, the people said. While other financial players have also looked at providing a loan to Home Capital, a bank syndicate is seen as the most likely outcome, the people said.  The talks are ongoing and there is no certainty that an agreement would be reached, the people said. Home Capital last month bolstered its board with a string of high-profile appointments made in an effort to rebuild investor confidence in the company. The new board, which includes former RBC executive Alan Hibben and former Ontario Teachers Pension Plan head Claude Lamoureux, has prioritized refinancing and replacing the emergency HOOPP loan, people familiar with the matter said.

Before he was killed, a gunman shot and wounded a senior Republican House leader and several others getting ready on an Alexandria, Virginia, field for a charity game between Republicans and Democrats on Thursday in nearby Washington, D.C. The annual Congressional Baseball Game charity event, where Senate and House members from both parties face off together, has raised $600,000 for the Boys and Girls Club, the Washington Nationals Dream Foundation and the Washington Literacy Center, according to several lawmakers and event organizers. The game at Nationals Park may be one of the last vestiges of cooperation between the two sides in the nation's capital, where some believe partisan politics is at an all-time high.    There's such a hatefulness in what we see in American politics and policy discussions right now ... this has got to stop,  Representative Rodney Davis, a Republican team member, told CNN in an interview while still wearing his baseball cleats and practice clothes. Davis said the congressional game was a great demonstration that Democrats and Republicans could still get along. Police investigate a shooting scene after a gunman opened fire on Republican members of Congress during a baseball practice near Washington in Alexandria, Virginia.Joshua RobertsâWe have fun,  said a visibly upset Davis.  I never thought I'd play a baseball game for charity, got to practice at 6:30 in the morning and have to dodge bullets.  The gun violence early on Wednesday scarred what is for many almost sacred American ground - the baseball field. Considered America's so-called national pastime, the game dates back to the 1800s even as it now competes heavily with other popular sports including football and basketball. Slideshow (4 Images) I've always felt safe on a baseball field, and now I don't know if I'll ever feel safe on a baseball field again,  Representative Chuck Fleischmann, also at the shooting scene, told CNN.  The grassy field once known for roasted peanuts and hot dogs now instead conjures images of a battlefield, fellow Republican Brad Wenstrup, an Army Reserve officer, said on Twitter.   You never expect a baseball field in America to feel like being back in a combat zone in Iraq, but this morning it did,  wrote Wenstrup, a congressman from Ohio.  When congressional members were told in a bipartisan briefing that Thursday's baseball game would still be held despite the shooting, they leapt to their feet in a standing ovation, Republican Representative Martha McSally told Reuters.  Tomorrow we'll go out on the field, we'll root for our team,  U.S. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi later told lawmakers from the chamber floor.  We will use this occasion as one that brings us together and not one that separates us further.

Federer, who opted to take time off in order to prepare for an assault on an eighth Wimbledon crown, made a sensational start to the year by winning the Australian Open and subsequent titles at Indian Wells and Miami. Despite a superb first set on grass, the 35-year-old squandered a matchpoint and lost his grip on the game in the oldest tour match, in terms of combined ages, since 1982 and suffered only his second loss of the season.  I thought it was a typical grasscourt match today. Rallies weren't very long and it was decided on a serve there or a return here,  Federer told reporters.  If you don't take your chances like I didn't, leading a set and a break, you really only have yourself to blame at the end. You have to acknowledge the fact that he was a bit better. It's quite frustrating, but thatâs the way it goes sometimes.   I definitely was not as sharp as I was hoping to be in maybe the big moments, or the moment when I had the lead and where I feel I should have been cruising from that moment on.  Federer squandered a matchpoint in the second set as 39-year-old Haas, ranked 302nd and in his farewell season, proved more consistent, eventually setting up a quarter-final clash against countryman Mischa Zverev. With another victory Haas, the lowest-ranked player to beat Federer since world number 407 Bjoern Phau in 1999, will become the oldest player to reach a tour semi-final since 40-year-old Jimmy Connors in 1993 in San Francisco.   I am speechless, of course,  Haas said.  There are a lot of emotions when you are playing a close friend.  When you come into the second set, save a match point and then come back, that always makes you very happy about a win. I am shocked myself.  Federer grabbed an early break as his attacking topspin backhand, which had served him so well earlier this year, was again on display. Haas, a former world number two, was broken again as the Swiss served out the set after 22 minutes. But Federer lost his focus, allowing Haas to find a way back. The world number five saved four set points and wasted a match point as the German forced a third set, where he broke his opponent early on and held on to his advantage.

She said she assumed that the talks would proceed despite the setback for Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservatives in the June 8 parliamentary election, in which her party lost its governing majority.  We're ready on the European side. We'll see about the rest,  Merkel told reporters after a meeting with top government officials, unions and business leaders in Meseberg, a town in eastern Germany.  She declined to speculate about any change in Britain's plans to withdraw from the EU following the election, saying,  The citizens have decided, and I assume that we will have to carry out these negotiations.  May has said the divorce talks, likely to be the most complex in Europe since World War Two, would begin as planned next week and her Brexit minister, David Davis, said London's negotiating position was unchanged. But May's predecessor, David Cameron, said there would be pressure after last week's surprise for a  softer  Brexit that gave greater priority to a close trading deal with the EU. Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel, echoing remarks by French President Emmanuel Macron, said the door to Europe remained open to Britain, and it was up to the British people whether they wanted to change their minds about leaving the EU.  We all have an interest ... in keeping them as close as possible to the European Union, because Britain is an important country, vital to the EU in the security and foreign policy realm, and naturally also a part of the European market,  he said. Both Merkel and Gabriel said the EU would have to safeguard its own interests in the negotiations with Britain.  The remaining 27 nations of the future European Union must represent our interests in a way that strengthens unity among the 27 and still maintains good relations with Britain,  Merkel told the joint news conference.

The Liberal Democrats were the only nationwide party which campaigned to offer Britons another referendum on whether to leave the EU. But they failed to increase their support and have only 12 out of parliament's 650 seats.  Although the party could still play an important role with Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservatives lacking an overall majority, Farron had been criticised for running a disappointing campaign and had faced repeated questions about his Christian beliefs, particularly whether he believed gay sex was sinful.  From the very first day of my leadership, I have faced questions about my Christian faith,  Farron said.Â  I've tried to answer with grace and patience.Â Sometimes my answers could have been wiser. Â   He said the focus on his faith had been a distraction. The party's spokesman on home affairs quit earlier on Wednesday citing concerns about Farron's views that were highlighted during campaigning. Farron said he had concluded that it was impossible for him to stay as leader of a progressive, liberal party and live as a committed Christian despite not seeking to impose his views on others.  I seem to be the subject of suspicion because of what I believe and who my faith is in,  he said.  In which case we are kidding ourselves if we think we yet live in a tolerant, liberal society.  The Liberal Democrats had joined the Conservatives in a coalition government led by David Cameron in 2010 after winning 57 seats. However, five years later they were routed and won just eight. Farron had said his party would not support either May's Conservatives or the opposition Labour Party in forming a government after last week's election left no outright winner. He will stay on in his job until the party starts the process of electing a new leader next month. Former Business Secretary Vince Cable and Jo Swinson, who was a junior minister in the coalition government, are the favourites to replace him.

Researchers focused on surgery for a common knee injury known as an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tear, which has long been linked to intense participation in sports like basketball and soccer which require constant pivoting as well as contact sports like football.  The study of private insurance data for 148 million U.S. residents found that overall, the average annual ACL surgery rate climbed 22 percent from 2002 to 2014, when it reached 75 procedures for every 100,000 people.  For teen girls, however, the average annual knee surgery rate rose by 59 percent during the study period to 269 procedures for every 100,000 people.  âAlthough there are proven ACL injury prevention programs available, they are not being widely adopted, particularly among young women,â said lead study author Mackenzie Herzog of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Because the proportion of teens getting surgery within a year of an ACL injury remained steady during the study period, the surge in procedures is likely due to an increase in injuries and not a shift toward more aggressive treatment, Herzog said by email.  While the study didnât examine why more injuries are happening, Herzog points to a few trends in youth sports that may be contributing to the problem. âThere are likely multiple factors contributing to the increase, including increased participation due to broader promotion of physical activity to improve health and adolescents participating in athletics more frequently and more intensely,â Herzog said.  âTwo particular trends that concern us are increased trends toward year-round sports participation at a young age and the tendency to specialize in one sport early.â  For teen boys, the average annual knee surgery rate climbed 44 percent during the study period to end at 212 procedures for every 100,000 people, researchers report in JAMA Pediatrics.  Surgery rates also rose faster for women than for men, although adult male athletes still had more procedures. By the end of the study, 87 men and 61 women out of every 100,000 people had ACL surgery each year.  The study has several limitations, including the lack of data on what sports people played, how often they participated in practices and competitions and any individual characteristics or medical conditions that might influence the odds of ACL injuries.  For young female athletes, the rise in injuries may be due at least in part to a new generation of women coming of age after the 1972 passage of Title IX, a U.S. law giving women the same right to participate in education and school sports as their male counterparts. Before the law took effect, women had far fewer opportunities to participate in sports. âI think that the reason for the increased incidence of ACL tears and subsequent surgery in women is absolutely because more women and girls are playing sports,â said Dr. Elizabeth Gardner of Yale University School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut.  âAs this is really the second generation after Title IX, the intensity of training for womenâs sports is also increasing dramatically,â Gardner, who wasnât involved in the study, said by email.  Cross-training programs that include exercises to improve strength, balance, coordination and muscle control can help prevent ACL tears, Dr. Devin Peterson, a researcher at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, who wasnât involved in the study, said by email.

In somewhat of a surprise to some observers given a series of weak inflation readings, the U.S. central bank revised its long-standing  policy normalization  plans to show it expects to halt the current reinvestments by ever-larger increments of maturing Treasury- and mortgage-backed bonds. Policymakers did not specify when they would begin the run-off, though they are aiming for some time later this year. As it stands, the Fed tops up any bonds that mature to keep its balance sheet at a steady level. The Fed plans to initially allow no more than $6 billion in Treasuries to run off per month, and will raise that  cap  each quarter by $6 billion over 12 months until it reaches $30 billion in maturing bonds per month. For mortgage bonds, the Fed will start with $4 billion per month and raise it in quarterly steps of $4 billion until it reaches a $20-billion monthly cap. Wall Street economists had been predicting the cap on Treasuries would be roughly between $5-$15 billion per month, and on mortgage bonds $5-$10 billion, rising by increments of $5-$15 billion, according to research notes. They generally expect the Fed to begin the process at a mid-September policy meeting. The Fed amassed the record bond holdings in three rounds of so-called quantitative easing meant to stimulate U.S. investment and hiring in the wake of the 2007-2009 financial crisis and recession. It is the world's largest holder of U.S. government debt, raising fears that as it steps back from the market yields could shoot higher - though that has not yet happened. The Fed added that while its main tool for managing monetary policy will remain short-term interest rates, which it raised a notch on Wednesday, it would be prepared to halt its balance sheet reduction or even add more bonds to its portfolio should there be a  material deterioration in the economic outlook.

Last week, suicide bombers and gunmen attacked parliament and Ayatollah Khomeini's mausoleum in Tehran, killing 17 people in what was an unprecedented security breach for Iran. Islamic State claimed responsibility and threatened more attacks against Iran's majority Shi'ite population, whom the hardline Sunni militants consider heretics. Iran has arrested almost 50 people in connection with the attacks.  On Wednesday, state media reported that security forces had fought with members of Ansar al-Furqan, a militant Sunni group, in Chabahar, a city in southeastern Iran. Intelligence minister Mahmoud Alavi was quoted as saying by state media that two militants had been killed and five arrested. One security officer was also killed, he said. Local news agencies had earlier said three militants were killed.  Five members of this terrorist team were Iranians and two were from neighboring countries,  Alavi added.  State news agency IRNA quoted an unnamed source as saying that the militants were planning to carry out attacks this week, during the holy nights of Ramadan.  The security forces surrounded the house that members of this terrorist cell were based in and launched an attack with backing of the police,  the source said. Authorities said they had found ammunition, explosive belts and weapons.  Ansar al-Furqan - or Partisans of the Criterion - is a Sunni group based in Sistan and Baluchestan province that has threatened to carry out suicide attacks on economic and military centers in revenge for the government's execution of Sunni prisoners. The group, which was formed by the merger of some Sunni Baluch insurgent groups in 2012, is not linked to Islamic State. But it has carried out periodic attacks on military and civilian targets, aiming to highlight what it says is discrimination against Iran's Sunni ethnic groups. Iran has stepped up its crackdown against members of such networks in recent years, with mass arrests and death sentences. The main Sunni Iranian separatist groups increasingly see themselves as part of a larger struggle between Shi'ite Iran and the Sunni-ruled Arab states across the Gulf, which back opposing sides in the Syrian civil war, Iraq and Yemen. Tehran claims Saudi Arabia is funding most of these groups, a charge Riyadh denies.

Tens of thousands of war-related fatalities among city dwellers accounted for 70 percent of civilian deaths in the two countries during the period, the agency said. The Yemeni cities of Taiz, Sadaa and Sanaa have also become deadly battlefields.  This is all the more alarming as new offensives (against Islamic State militants) get under way in cities like Raqqa in Syria or intensify in Mosul, Iraq,  said Robert Mardini, ICRC regional director for the Middle East.  Taiz remains partly besieged just as daily air strikes and shelling continue to terrify residents,  he told a news conference to launch an ICRC report called  I Saw My City Die . The phenomenon is not limited to the Middle East, Mardini said.  We see also that many other conflicts are taking place in urban areas in other places such as Somalia and Afghanistan and other countries.  Battles raging in cities, which are  today the new normal unfortunately , damage vital infrastructure and disrupt basic services including health care, Mardini said.  The impacts of warfare are quickly multiplied with exponential consequences. If a power line is hit, (there is) no water, no electricity, no waste water treatment. There are contamination outbreaks and massive challenges to run hospitals,  he said. Yemen's two-year civil war has been marked by a Saudi-led coalition carrying out massive air strikes to restore President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi to power and end rule by the Iran-backed Houthi militia. Yemen's health system has all but collapsed, compounded by  a deadly outbreak of cholera, a water-borne disease that can kill within hours, the ICRC said.  In the last 6 weeks, 1 in 200 Yemenis have contracted cholera while almost 1,000 have died. The outbreak has not seen its peak yet. It's just accelerating,  Maria Del Pilar Bauza Moreno, ICRC health coordinator in Yemen, said by video from Sanaa. More than 5,000 new cases of cholera were reported each day last week in Yemen, bringing the total to some 135,000. The ICRC has flown in four cargo planes with chlorine to treat water, as well as intravenous fluids to rehydrate patients.  Cholera has found the perfect ground - deteriorated living conditions, poor hygiene behavior, unsafe drinking water in most of the cities, collapsed sewage systems, and uncollected garbage everywhere,  Bauza Moreno said.

Tens of thousands of war-related fatalities among city dwellers accounted for 70 percent of civilian deaths in the two countries during the period, the agency said. The Yemeni cities of Taiz, Sadaa and Sanaa have also become deadly battlefields.  This is all the more alarming as new offensives (against Islamic State militants) get under way in cities like Raqqa in Syria or intensify in Mosul, Iraq,  said Robert Mardini, ICRC regional director for the Middle East.  Taiz remains partly besieged just as daily air strikes and shelling continue to terrify residents,  he told a news conference to launch an ICRC report called  I Saw My City Die . The phenomenon is not limited to the Middle East, Mardini said.  We see also that many other conflicts are taking place in urban areas in other places such as Somalia and Afghanistan and other countries.  Battles raging in cities, which are  today the new normal unfortunately , damage vital infrastructure and disrupt basic services including health care, Mardini said.  The impacts of warfare are quickly multiplied with exponential consequences. If a power line is hit, (there is) no water, no electricity, no waste water treatment. There are contamination outbreaks and massive challenges to run hospitals,  he said. Yemen's two-year civil war has been marked by a Saudi-led coalition carrying out massive air strikes to restore President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi to power and end rule by the Iran-backed Houthi militia. Yemen's health system has all but collapsed, compounded by  a deadly outbreak of cholera, a water-borne disease that can kill within hours, the ICRC said.  In the last 6 weeks, 1 in 200 Yemenis have contracted cholera while almost 1,000 have died. The outbreak has not seen its peak yet. It's just accelerating,  Maria Del Pilar Bauza Moreno, ICRC health coordinator in Yemen, said by video from Sanaa. More than 5,000 new cases of cholera were reported each day last week in Yemen, bringing the total to some 135,000. The ICRC has flown in four cargo planes with chlorine to treat water, as well as intravenous fluids to rehydrate patients.  Cholera has found the perfect ground - deteriorated living conditions, poor hygiene behavior, unsafe drinking water in most of the cities, collapsed sewage systems, and uncollected garbage everywhere,  Bauza Moreno said.

Trump,USA,EDUCATION/LOANS (UPDATE 1),Americas,United States","sector":"","content":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos on Wednesday called for a  regulatory reset,  and pressed pause on a rule intended to speedily cancel the student-loan debts of people defrauded by for-profit Corinthian Colleges Inc and others, so that it can be rewritten. DeVos said the department is still granting debt relief that the students are entitled to by law as expeditiously as possible, and some borrowers should expect to obtain discharges within the next several weeks. The Education Department is processing 16,000 claims for relief. DeVos, a Republican and advocate of public-private partnerships in education, said she was delaying the effective date of the rule on accelerating the process, which was enacted at the end of last year under the administration of former President Barack Obama, a Democrat.  Unfortunately, last yearâs rulemaking effort missed an opportunity to get it right,  DeVos said in a statement.  The result is a muddled process that's unfair to students and schools, and puts taxpayers on the hook for significant costs. Itâs time for a regulatory reset.  Obama overhauled federal student lending, moving it from the banks to the Education Department and also trying to prevent students from taking out loans they could not repay after graduation. He specifically targeted for-profit, career colleges that promise students they will find jobs post-graduation and can charge high tuition. The reforms became a hot-button issue in last year's presidential campaign, with Democrats seeking to preserve them and Republicans such as then-candidate President Donald Trump saying the U.S. government should  get out of the business  of lending. In recent weeks states and Democratic lawmakers have pressed DeVos on the  borrower defense  rule, saying thousands of student have been caught in limbo as the Education Department slowly grants discharges. They have especially been concerned about growing backlogs of relief applications and of loans approved for discharge that simply need a sign-off. They say the delays force students to keep up unaffordable monthly payments or face debt collection. Amid federal and state investigations in 2015 into its post-graduation rates, Corinthian filed for bankruptcy and abruptly closed its 28 schools. Many students were caught with student loans they had taken out to pay for Corinthian tuition. DeVos said she would also seek to redo a  gainful employment  rule that was intended to help students avoid enrolling in and taking out student loans for career colleges that consistently fail to deliver on promises of job security and high salaries for graduates.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-education-loans-idUSL1N1JB1RQ"},

Tillerson said it was possible that the Ukrainian government could come to an agreement with Moscow outside the structure of the 2015 accord.  I think it is important that we be given sufficient flexibility to achieve the Minsk objectives. It is very possible that the government of Ukraine and the government of Russia could come to a satisfactory resolution through some structure other than Minsk,  Tillerson told the House Foreign Affairs Committee.  My caution is I wouldn't want to have ourselves handcuffed to Minsk if it turns out the parties decide to settle this through another, a different, agreement,  he said. Related CoverageTillerson: U.S. committed to 'One China' policy, also TaiwanThe Minsk peace agreement, brokered by France and Germany and signed by Russia and Ukraine in February 2015, calls for a ceasefire, the withdrawal of heavy weapons from the front line and constitutional reform to give eastern Ukraine more autonomy. As Washington focuses on potential Trump administration ties to Russia, lawmakers have been insisting that no sanctions on Russia be lifted until it complies with the agreement. Tillerson was responding to Representative Eliot Engel, the committee's ranking Democrat, who asked if it was in the U.S. interest to relax sanctions on Russia before it fully complied. Engel said the approach suggested by Tillerson would send the wrong signal to Russia.   If they think that we're somehow willing to relax the sanctions on them before they've complied with the Minsk framework and left Crimea, I think it just will encourage Putin to continue his bullying,  Engel said.   And who knows where he'll strike next.  Tillerson spoke at a wide-ranging budget hearing in which he also discussed Trump's China policy and said he expected the administration to complete a review of Afghan policy in the coming weeks. Many members of the U.S. Congress, including some of Trump's fellow Republicans, disagree sharply with his proposal to slash foreign aid and spending on diplomacy. Trump, who wants sharp increases in military spending, sees the proposed cuts as a way to help balance the budget. His critics say such that approach would pose a threat to the country's security by weakening so-called  soft power  programs that win international support.

She said she assumed that the talks would proceed despite the setback for Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservatives in the June 8 parliamentary election, in which her party lost its governing majority.  We're ready on the European side. We'll see about the rest,  Merkel told reporters after a meeting with top government officials, unions and business leaders in Meseberg, a town in eastern Germany. She declined to speculate about any change in Britain's plans to withdraw from the EU following the election, saying,  The citizens have decided, and I assume that we will have to carry out these negotiations.  May has said the divorce talks, likely to be the most complex in Europe since World War Two, would begin as planned next week and her Brexit minister, David Davis, said London's negotiating position was unchanged. But May's predecessor, David Cameron, said there would be pressure after last week's surprise for a  softer  Brexit that gave greater priority to a close trading deal with the EU. Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel, echoing remarks by French President Emmanuel Macron, said the door to Europe remained open to Britain, and it was up to the British people whether they wanted to change their minds about leaving the EU.  We all have an interest ... in keeping them as close as possible to the European Union, because Britain is an important country, vital to the EU in the security and foreign policy realm, and naturally also a part of the European market,  he said. Both Merkel and Gabriel said the EU would have to safeguard its own interests in the negotiations with Britain.  The remaining 27 nations of the future European Union must represent our interests in a way that strengthens unity among the 27 and still maintains good relations with Britain,  Merkel told the joint news conference. Gabriel said the drop in support for May's Conservatives reflected dissatisfaction with the Brexit process.  There's no benefit to messing with the interests of your population all too much,  he said.

The electrified enclosure on a former cattle property outside of Alice Springs in the Northern Territory will cover around 9,450 hectares (22.2 acres), almost twice the size of the city of Manhattan. The project by The Australian Wildlife Conservancy will represent the biggest predator-proof fenced area in the world when completed, Australia's Threatened Species Commissioner Gregory Andrews told Reuters.  The science is crystal clear that feral cats are the single biggest threat to our mammals and many of our threatened species will benefit from this new area,  Andrews said on Tuesday. The Australian government is spending $5 million to assist in the reduction of the feral cat population by 2 million cats from an estimate 11 million. One feral cat can kill between five to seven animals each night. Australia has used fences in a bid to control the movement of pests since the 1880s, most notably the 5,614 km (3,488 miles) dingo fence built in 1885. The fence crosses three states and separates wild dingo dogs from sheep farms. Construction of the electrified fence in the Newhaven Sanctuary will see rangers roll out more than 1,600 km (994 miles) of wire and 35,000 pickets. The 180cm (1.8 feet) high fence will be crowned with an overhang to keep predators from climbing it and a skirting at the bottom will prevent burrowing. After completion of the enclosure in early 2018, stage two will see rangers track and eliminate feral pests within the enclosed zone before re-introduction of endangered native species. Species to be re-introduced include rock wallabies, smaller Rufous-hare wallabies and the rodent-like burrowing bettong. Reporting by Claudia Long.

Yet for all the excitement it is generating within European Union institutions, opt-outs secured by major telecoms firms and member states' refusal to give up their lucrative national airwaves may leave many holidaymakers disappointed this summer - and facing higher bills at home. Ending the practice of adding hefty charges to surf the internet, call or send texts when abroad within the EU has been a cause celebre for the European Commission and Parliament which saw it as an affront to common market ideals.  The European Union is about bringing people together and making their lives easier. The end of roaming charges is a true European success story,  the institutions said on Wednesday. The Commission draped a victory banner down its Berlaymont headquarters reading  Goodbye roaming fees . The change in legislation finally passed several months ago was certainly welcomed by some visitors to Brussels.  I think it's excellent,  said Charlie Wild, a musician from Scotland.  I've been in Europe for two weeks spending three pounds ($3.80) a day to be able to use my phone, and tomorrow I don't have to, and it's great.  Julie DuBlanc, visiting from France for work, said,  We'll be checking our phones more often, as we would in Paris.  But she may need to be careful. The project has faced numerous setbacks as mobile phone operators have lobbied to maintain what has been a significant source of revenue while the realities of a fragmented telecoms market have confounded  politicians' efforts to do away with the charges. The snag was that while customers can no longer by law be asked to pay extra when using phones abroad, operators still face wholesale fees from the foreign networks that connect them. A solution which involves capping wholesale charges has proved fiendishly complex since it means setting a cap that suits companies in all 28 member states, even though domestic mobile rates vary hugely. North vs South FILE PHOTO: Tourists take a break in the decorated yard of Brussels' town hall, Belgium, August 12, 2015.Francois Lenoir/File PhotoIn northern Europe countries, which are effectively net exporters of tourists, there is concern that high wholesale fees being paid to networks in southern holiday destinations, combined with the loss of roaming revenue, could force firms to stop letting customers use their phones abroad at all. Alternatively, the companies in the north could raise charges at home to offset the losses, effectively forcing poorer, stay-at-home customers to subsidize travelers. In the tourist-magnet south, governments argued that low wholesale charges would hurt their local phone operators which play host to visitors, and force them to jack up rates for customers at home as well. The compromise struck pleased the larger operators but smaller firms said the wholesale roaming caps were still too high, and the effects are beginning to ripple out. FILE PHOTO: A tourist takes a selfie on a beach while an airplane prepares to land at Larnaca International Airport, Cyprus, June 28, 2016.Yiannis Kourtoglou/File Photo The regulated wholesale cost still remains relatively high comparative to usage,  said Phillip Malloch, vice-president and head of group public affairs at Swedish operator Telia. As a result, Telia will stop offering roaming as part of its Swedish data-only mobile broadband price plans, Malloch said. Operators in Scandinavia and the Baltics, including Telia in Estonia and Lithuania, have also applied for exemptions from the obligation to stop levying roaming charge - something EU rules allow if the companies face at least a 3 percent revenue hit. Some in the business were not impressed by the loopholes.  It's a real shame and disappointment that the incumbent operators, who fought against lower roaming charges so hard, are now abusing the system to over-charge their customers,  said an executive at a virtual network operator, or a company that offers network services using the networks of other providers. Credit Suisse analysts estimated in April that the introduction of roam-like-at-home was leading to increases in base tariffs to offset the lost revenue, which is expected to be between 2 percent and 5 percent across Europe. However, Malloch at Telia said it was too early to say who would be the winners and losers, as the end of roaming was likely to lead to higher data consumption as people lounging on the beach stop holding back from sharing their holiday snaps.

The leftist party has slipped in polls further behind its rival and government coalition partner ANO, an anti-corruption movement founded in 2011 by billionaire tycoon Andrej Babis that has drawn voters with its business-like approach to governing. ANO holds a double-digit margin over the Social Democrats. The parties, together with the Christian Democrats, came to power together in a center-left coalition in January 2014 and are on course to becoming the first government in 15 years in the central European country to finish out its term. Despite being the most stable government in recent times and presiding over a growing economy that helped it deliver the first balanced budget in two decades, the Social Democrats have received little credit, dropping in polls and failing to find issues to draw in a wider spectrum of voters.  If (the party) is to improve its chances before the key elections... it has to undergo deeper changes, so that it would be able to better address people and to mobilize its supporters and members,  Sobotka told a news conference.   Therefore I proposed a new distribution of responsibilities in the leadership.  Sobotka, a career politician with the Social Democrats since Communist rule ended in the country in 1989, tapped his more popular and eloquent foreign minister Lubomir Zaoralek to lead the party's campaign into the Oct. 20-21 general election. Interior Minister Milan Chovanec will take over duties running the party, according to internal rules. Sobotka's resignation takes effect on Thursday. The Czech economy has shown solid growth since Sobotka came to power and the number of unemployed in the country has fallen to the lowest level in the European Union.  The party looked to have come out victors in a cabinet dispute in May that saw the dismissal of Babis. Sobotka had pushed for Babis's sacking amid allegations the businessman dodged paying taxes in the past with the use of company bonds and also interfered in a national newspaper he owns while in politics - which Babis denies. Babis, after weeks of wrangling that pitted him and President Milos Zeman against Sobotka, eventually agreed to his dismissal after picking his successor.

Intel will use net proceeds for general corporate purposes, ahead of the company's pending acquisition of Mobileye N.V. (Mobileye). Intel just received U.S. regulatory approval for the acquisition and Fitch believes the transaction should close before the end of calendar year 2017. Pro forma for: i) the issuance, ii) $6.5 billion of senior notes issuance in May 2017, iii) repayment of $500 million of senior notes in May 2017 and iv) expected repayment of $3 billion of senior notes maturing Dec. 15, 2017, Fitch estimates total debt is just over $29 billion. A full list of current ratings follows at the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS Leading Market Positions: Fitch expects Intel's very strong market positions in the data center and personal computers (PC) to provide significant revenue scale, with data center market growing in the mid-single digits offsetting mid-single-digit unit shipment declines in PCs. Technology Leadership: Intel's technology leadership, driven by significant cumulative investments in research and development (R&D;) and capital spending will support growth and strong profitability through at least the intermediate term. Solid FCF & Financial Flexibility: Fitch expects Intel's annual FCF to remain robust, despite significant investment activity. Fitch estimates more than $3.5 billion annually through the forecast period with upside should Intel maintain operating EBITDA margins in the mid-40% range, versus the low-40% range in 2016. Nevertheless, cash flow will provide adequate capacity for organic investments, although the majority of FCF is outside the U.S. High Investment Intensity: Fitch expects R&D; and capital spending to continue to represent 35%-40% of net revenues, driven by the continuation of Moore's Law and non-volatile memory (3D NAND and X-Point) technologies. At the same time, Intel has committed to limiting operating expenses as a percentage of revenue to 30% by 2020, versus 35.6% on a GAAP basis in 2016. Customer Concentration: Fitch expects customer concentration will remain significant, given the consolidated PC market. Intel's largest PC customers continued to represent approximately 40% of total sales in aggregate. Nonetheless, fast-growing acquisitions such as Mobileye, declining PC unit shipments, and Intel's increasing sale mix of data center and IoT customers should diversify Intel's sales mix over time. KEY ASSUMPTIONS --Flat Client Computing Group (CCG) revenue, driven by mid-single-digit unit declines offset by price increases from a strengthening PC mix and new product introductions; --Data Center Group (DCG) grows by mid-single digits in 2017 and low single digits thereafter with healthy spending from cloud and communications service providers offset by weaker enterprise spending; --IoT grows by high-single digits in 2017 and accelerates to the low-teens through the remainder of the forecast period; --Non-volatile memory remains uneven with solid growth for 2017 due to tight supply that should ease in 2018; --Low-single-digit growth for security and programmable through the forecast period; --Stable operating EBITDA margins due to a richer mix in CCG offset by lower operating income for DCG; --Operating EBITDA could exceed $27 billion for the year, resulting in total leverage (total debt/operating EBITDA) near 1x and FCF/debt of more than 15% exiting the year; --Capital spending remains volatile but in the mid-teens through the forecast period; --Intel closes Mobileye by the end of calendar 2017 and grows 25% per year with modestly accretive operating EBITDA margins; --$500 million of annual tuck-in acquisitions with no meaningful impact on financial results; --Intel refinances debt maturities and uses domestic cash left after dividends and acquisitions for share repurchases. RATING SENSITIVITIES Negative rating actions for Intel could result from the following: --Fitch's expectation for total leverage sustained above 1.5x from debt-financed shareholder returns amid weak operating performance, given that a meaningful portion of pre-dividend FCF is outside the U.S.; --Expectation for negative organic revenue growth from share losses in DCG and slower than anticipated IoT adoption compounding negative growth in PCs; --Fitch's expectation for normalized FCF/adjusted debt sustained below 10%, as a result of market pricing pressures from strengthened competitive offerings in DCG. Positive rating action is unlikely in the intermediate term but likely would require Fitch's expectations for the following: --Management's commitment to moderate shareholder returns to maintain total leverage at or below 1x; --Intel maintains significant share leadership and strong profitability in data center, despite intensifying competition from alternative architectures; --Significant disruption from Intel's X-point technology and steady and solid growth in IoT markets, resulting in further diversification of Intel's sales mix and profit pools. LIQUIDITY Liquidity was solid as of April 1, 2017 and consisted of: --$17.3 billion of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and trading assets, of which $14.2 billion was outside the U.S. and $2.2 billion was available for use in the U.S. without incurring incremental tax liabilities. The company plans to use offshore cash to fund the $15.3 billion acquisition of Mobileye N.V. (Mobileye), which is scheduled to close before the end of calendar 2017; --An up to $5 billion commercial paper (CP) program, of which $431 million was outstanding. Intel does not have a revolving credit facility to support its CP program but Fitch views the company's cash flow profile as providing ample support for the program, particularly given Fitch's expectations for only moderate use. Fitch's expectations for more than $3 billion of annual FCF also support liquidity. FULL LIST OF CURRENT RATINGS Intel Corporation --Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'A+'; --Short-Term IDR 'F1'; --CP program 'F1'; --Senior unsecured notes 'A+'; --Junior subordinated notes 'A'. Altera Corporation --Long-Term IDR 'A+'; --Senior Unsecured Debt 'A+'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.

In a Wednesday securities filing, Bradesco said Brazil's Federal Regional Court of the 1st Region acquitted Trabuco of charges he participated in a plan to avoid the fine imposed by Brazil's Tax Revenue Service.  The accusations against Trabuco, one of Brazil's most influential power brokers, came as a series of corruption scandals at state firms rattled Brazil's political establishment and undermined President Michel Temer's administration. Court officials declined further comment on the ruling. Preferred shares of the Osasco, Brazil-based lender (BBDC4.SA) added as much as 4.4 percent to 27.28 reais. They were trading 3.9 percent higher at 27.12 reais in Wednesday midafternoon trading. In May 2016, Trabuco was formally accused over his role in unethical negotiations between Bradesco and government tax auditors to reduce or eliminate fines. The matter is part of a broader probe of fraud at the Finance Ministry's tax appeals board that was unveiled in March 2015. The probe, known in Brazil as  Operation Zealots,  has alleged that some of Brazil's largest companies bribed members of the CARF - a Finance Ministry body that hears appeals on tax disputes - in return for favorable rulings. Trabuco, 65, agreed last year to stay longer at the helm of Bradesco to groom a successor.  Since taking over in late 2008, Trabuco has presided over Bradesco's rapid growth in consumer financial services and the $5.2 billion purchase of HSBC Holdings Plc's (HSBA.L) Brazilian unit in August 2015, its largest acquisition ever. The cases under investigation came before the CARF board between 2005 and 2013. The  Zealots  probe worsened the political climate in Brazil as a larger corruption scandal,  Operation Car Wash,  helped drive the country into its worst recession on record. The tax probe ensnared other prominent executives including AndrÃ© Gerdau Johannpeter, the scion and CEO of steelmaker Gerdau SA (GGBR4.SA) and Joseph Safra, owner of Banco Safra SA.

In addition, after a solid 2016, portfolio growth is likely to moderate over the near term, particularly for consumer-oriented companies, as U.S. auto sales are expected to decline. Average portfolio growth for the captives in this report was 4.5% in 2016, up slightly from 3.9% in 2015. Average pretax earnings margins were 23% in 2016, down from 29% in the prior year, due primarily to weakening asset quality, declines in used vehicle prices, and competitive pressure on asset yields.  Weaker credit performance is likely to continue in 2017with both charge-offs and delinquencies climbing from historically low levels as a result of portfolio seasoning and lower recovery rates on defaulted auto loans,  said Michael Taiano, Director, Fitch Ratings. Overall credit quality for consumer and commercial captives in 2016 continued to weaken, which was consistent with Fitch's expectations following post-crisis lows that were unsustainable. Average net loss rates for the captives included in this report increased meaningfully, to 0.82% in 2016 from 0.61% in 2015. The increase in net credit losses was most pronounced within the auto captive segment. Leverage has also been on the rise for several captives. Average leverage for the group ticked up slightly at YE16 to 7.5x versus 7.4x in 2015, with many captives currently at or near five-year averages. Captive leverage, as measured by debt to tangible equity, is typically higher relative to many stand-alone finance companies in part due to explicit or implicit parent support. The willingness of parent companies to inject capital and/or reduce/forgo dividends to support asset growth has limited further increases in leverage. Fitch expects U.S. captive portfolio growth to moderate in 2017, which should limit further increases in leverage for most, absent material credit deterioration.  The slight increase in leverage reflects stronger portfolio growth relative to more moderate earnings growth,  added Taiano. With the exception of Caterpillar Financial Services Corporation's (CFSC), whose Rating Outlook was revised to Negative from Stable on Dec. 8, 2016, the Rating Outlooks for all Fitch-rated U.S. captive finance companies (captives) are Stable following the revision of General Motors Financial's (GMF) Rating Outlook to Stable from Positive in conjunction with the ratings upgrade to 'BBB' from 'BBB-' on June 8, 2017. All Fitch-rated U.S. captives are equalized with their corporate parents, reflecting Fitch's view that they are core to the parents' businesses.

The manner of Fitchâs factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitchâs ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed. The information in this report is provided âas isâ without any representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein.

Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent).

U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan said  blanket suppression  was necessary because  sweeping  January 2012 searches of Wey's Manhattan apartment and the offices of his consulting firm, New York Global Group, violated his Fourth Amendment constitutional right against illegal searches and seizures. In a 92-page decision on Tuesday night, the Manhattan judge said prosecutors failed to show they needed broad warrants because they had probable cause to believe Wey's entire business was a scam. Items seized included children's school records, divorce records, family photos, medical records, prescription documents, recreational schedules, resumes and X-rays, the judge said.  This conduct reflects, at least, grossly negligent or reckless disregard of the strictures of the Fourth Amendment,  Nathan wrote. A spokeswoman for Acting U.S. Attorney Joon Kim in Manhattan declined to comment. Wey's lawyer David Siegal said  it's hard to imagine what other evidence won't be tainted  in the case, given how the searches were conducted early in the probe.  We're preparing for trial, and the government has some hard decisions to make,  he said. A trial is scheduled for Oct. 2. In reverse mergers, Chinese companies buy U.S.  shell  companies and assume their stock tickers. This lets them raise money without regulatory reviews typical for newly public companies. Dozens of reverse mergers occurred nearly a decade ago, but many soured amid questions about accounting and disclosures. Wey was charged in September 2015 with eight criminal counts including securities fraud, wire fraud and money laundering. Prosecutors said he secretly controlled large blocks of shares in shell companies that went through reverse mergers, leaving him with big stakes in Nasdaq-listed CleanTech Innovations Inc, Deer Consumer Products Inc and SmartHeat Inc. Wey then manipulated the companies' stock prices, and sold shares at artificially high levels, prosecutors said. The defendant pleaded not guilty, and according to his firm's website  never settles false claims.  Nathan had in January refused to dismiss the indictment. Also charged was Wey's Switzerland-based banker Seref Dogan Erbek, who remains at large. Wey was also in the news in June 2015, when a federal jury ordered him to pay $18 million to a former employee in a sexual harassment case. The award was later cut to $5.65 million. Wey appealed, and has denied wrongdoing. The case is U.S. v. Wey, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 15-cr-00611.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-crime-wey-reversemergers-idUSKBN1952A3"},

Earlier this month, two French charities accused police of using excessive force against migrants and preventing aid groups from distributing meals. The human rights watchdog, an independent public body, said that its officials had interviewed migrants on Monday and found evidence of  unprecedented  rights violations.  The rights defender demands that the violations of migrants' fundamental rights be ceased immediately,  the watchdog said in a statement, accusing the government of allowing  inhuman living conditions . Thousands of migrants fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East, Africa and Asia have converged on the port city over the past decade, hoping to find a way of getting across the Channel to Britain. Most attempt to climb onto lorries or trains using the Channel Tunnel. Police have had to be deployed permanently in the area. Despite the dismantling of the camp known as  the jungle  in November 2016, local authorities and associations have said around 400 to 600 hundreds of migrants including young children were still trying to get to Britain from Calais.  The desire to get migrants to leave Calais has led to a situation where no shelters are tolerated. People - some of whom are minors - sleep on the ground regardless of the weather conditions,  the rights watchdog read. It also said migrants were deprived of sleep and denied access to water from the police.  Women ... could be subject to rape and sexual exploitation. Many of them have babies with them and several are to give birth in the coming weeks,  the watchdog said. A spokesman with the local government had no immediate comment.

Yet for all the excitement it is generating within European Union institutions, opt-outs secured by major telecoms firms and member states' refusal to give up their lucrative national airwaves may leave many holidaymakers disappointed this summer - and facing higher bills at home. Ending the practice of adding hefty charges to surf the internet, call or send texts when abroad within the EU has been a cause celebre for the European Commission and Parliament which saw it as an affront to common market ideals.  The European Union is about bringing people together and making their lives easier. The end of roaming charges is a true European success story,  the institutions said on Wednesday. The Commission draped a victory banner down its Berlaymont headquarters reading  Goodbye roaming fees . The change in legislation finally passed several months ago was certainly welcomed by some visitors to Brussels.  I think it's excellent,  said Charlie Wild, a musician from Scotland.  I've been in Europe for two weeks spending three pounds ($3.80) a day to be able to use my phone, and tomorrow I don't have to, and it's great.  Julie DuBlanc, visiting from France for work, said,  We'll be checking our phones more often, as we would in Paris.  But she may need to be careful. The project has faced numerous setbacks as mobile phone operators have lobbied to maintain what has been a significant source of revenue while the realities of a fragmented telecoms market have confounded  politicians' efforts to do away with the charges. The snag was that while customers can no longer by law be asked to pay extra when using phones abroad, operators still face wholesale fees from the foreign networks that connect them. A solution which involves capping wholesale charges has proved fiendishly complex since it means setting a cap that suits companies in all 28 member states, even though domestic mobile rates vary hugely. North vs South FILE PHOTO: Tourists take a break in the decorated yard of Brussels' town hall, Belgium, August 12, 2015.Francois Lenoir/File PhotoIn northern Europe countries, which are effectively net exporters of tourists, there is concern that high wholesale fees being paid to networks in southern holiday destinations, combined with the loss of roaming revenue, could force firms to stop letting customers use their phones abroad at all. Alternatively, the companies in the north could raise charges at home to offset the losses, effectively forcing poorer, stay-at-home customers to subsidize travelers. In the tourist-magnet south, governments argued that low wholesale charges would hurt their local phone operators which play host to visitors, and force them to jack up rates for customers at home as well. The compromise struck pleased the larger operators but smaller firms said the wholesale roaming caps were still too high, and the effects are beginning to ripple out. FILE PHOTO: A tourist takes a selfie on a beach while an airplane prepares to land at Larnaca International Airport, Cyprus, June 28, 2016.Yiannis Kourtoglou/File Photo The regulated wholesale cost still remains relatively high comparative to usage,  said Phillip Malloch, vice-president and head of group public affairs at Swedish operator Telia. As a result, Telia will stop offering roaming as part of its Swedish data-only mobile broadband price plans, Malloch said. Operators in Scandinavia and the Baltics, including Telia in Estonia and Lithuania, have also applied for exemptions from the obligation to stop levying roaming charge - something EU rules allow if the companies face at least a 3 percent revenue hit. Some in the business were not impressed by the loopholes.  It's a real shame and disappointment that the incumbent operators, who fought against lower roaming charges so hard, are now abusing the system to over-charge their customers,  said an executive at a virtual network operator, or a company that offers network services using the networks of other providers. Credit Suisse analysts estimated in April that the introduction of roam-like-at-home was leading to increases in base tariffs to offset the lost revenue, which is expected to be between 2 percent and 5 percent across Europe. However, Malloch at Telia said it was too early to say who would be the winners and losers, as the end of roaming was likely to lead to higher data consumption as people lounging on the beach stop holding back from sharing their holiday snaps.  It definitely carries some opportunity also,  Malloch said.

In a Wednesday securities filing, Bradesco said Brazil's Federal Regional Court of the 1st Region acquitted Trabuco of charges he participated in a plan to avoid the fine imposed by Brazil's Tax Revenue Service.  The accusations against Trabuco, one of Brazil's most influential power brokers, came as a series of corruption scandals at state firms rattled Brazil's political establishment and undermined President Michel Temer's administration. Court officials declined further comment on the ruling. Preferred shares of the Osasco, Brazil-based lender (BBDC4.SA) added as much as 4.4 percent to 27.28 reais. They were trading 3.9 percent higher at 27.12 reais in Wednesday midafternoon trading. In May 2016, Trabuco was formally accused over his role in unethical negotiations between Bradesco and government tax auditors to reduce or eliminate fines. The matter is part of a broader probe of fraud at the Finance Ministry's tax appeals board that was unveiled in March 2015. The probe, known in Brazil as  Operation Zealots,  has alleged that some of Brazil's largest companies bribed members of the CARF - a Finance Ministry body that hears appeals on tax disputes - in return for favorable rulings. Trabuco, 65, agreed last year to stay longer at the helm of Bradesco to groom a successor.  Since taking over in late 2008, Trabuco has presided over Bradesco's rapid growth in consumer financial services and the $5.2 billion purchase of HSBC Holdings Plc's (HSBA.L) Brazilian unit in August 2015, its largest acquisition ever. The cases under investigation came before the CARF board between 2005 and 2013. The  Zealots  probe worsened the political climate in Brazil as a larger corruption scandal,  Operation Car Wash,  helped drive the country into its worst recession on record. The tax probe ensnared other prominent executives including AndrÃ© Gerdau Johannpeter, the scion and CEO of steelmaker Gerdau SA (GGBR4.SA) and Joseph Safra, owner of Banco Safra SA.  According to Forbes Magazine, Safra is the world's richest banker.  In December, Brazilian judges dropped prosecution against Safra in connection with the scheme.

Dauffy's initial ambition had been to build a flying machine that could travel round the world in 80 days.

DeVos said the department is still granting debt relief that the students are entitled to by law as expeditiously as possible, and some borrowers should expect to obtain discharges within the next several weeks. The Education Department is processing 16,000 claims for relief. DeVos, a Republican and advocate of public-private partnerships in education, said she was delaying the effective date of the rule on accelerating the process, which was enacted at the end of last year under the administration of former President Barack Obama, a Democrat.   Unfortunately, last yearâs rulemaking effort missed an opportunity to get it right,  DeVos said in a statement.  The result is a muddled process that's unfair to students and schools, and puts taxpayers on the hook for significant costs. Itâs time for a regulatory reset.  Obama overhauled federal student lending, moving it from the banks to the Education Department and also trying to prevent students from taking out loans they could not repay after graduation. He specifically targeted for-profit, career colleges that promise students they will find jobs post-graduation and can charge high tuition. The reforms became a hot-button issue in last year's presidential campaign, with Democrats seeking to preserve them and Republicans such as then-candidate President Donald Trump saying the U.S. government should  get out of the business  of lending. In recent weeks states and Democratic lawmakers have pressed DeVos on the  borrower defense  rule, saying thousands of student have been caught in limbo as the Education Department slowly grants discharges.  They have especially been concerned about growing backlogs of relief applications and of loans approved for discharge that simply need a sign-off. They say the delays force students to keep up unaffordable monthly payments or face debt collection. Amid federal and state investigations in 2015 into its post-graduation rates, Corinthian filed for bankruptcy and abruptly closed its 28 schools. Many students were caught with student loans they had taken out to pay for Corinthian tuition. DeVos said she would also seek to redo a  gainful employment  rule that was intended to help students avoid enrolling in and taking out student loans for career colleges that consistently fail to deliver on promises of job security and high salaries for graduates.

He was 11 years old when he stepped on the mines as he gathered firewood in a vacant lot in Kabul, a city still trying to recover from years of civil war.  When I lost my legs ... I was in a terrible condition because I didnât know about my future and I was feeling very bad,  Mohammad, now 24, told Reuters as he rested after swim practice on a recent morning in Kabul.  Faced with an uncertain future in a country where many war victims face lifetimes of suffering, Mohammad's life changed when a U.S. government official arranged for him to receive treatment, physical therapy, and education in the United States. It was there that Mohammad first learned to swim, and put him on a track to what he hopes will eventually be sporting glory at the 2020 Summer Paralympics in Tokyo.  I hope to be selected there to represent my country, because the amputee community are looking at me,  Mohammad said. His dreams of competing in the Olympics have been dashed before, when he failed to make the cut for the summer games in London in 2012. He hopes that a good showing in the World Para Swimming Championships in Mexico City in September will help him get close to his dream. Nothing in Afghanistan is easy, however. Mohammad says his application to the Mexico games has been delayed by conflicting details on his identification papers, a common problem in Afghanistan where many people, including Mohammad, don't know their exact birth date and other information. The team members hope to follow 18-year-old Abbas Karimi, who recently qualified for Mexico while living and training in the United States.  The lack of resources for a world-class training programme makes it difficult for the members of the Afghan paralympic swimming team who don't have access to international facilities and support. Three members of the team, all with amputations from war wounds, train in small public pools with little government support. Malik Mohammad 24, relaxes in the pool during his training in Kabul, Afghanistan May 18, 2017.Mohammad IsmailThey are coached by Mohammad Jawad, a veteran javelin thrower, who volunteers his time to help.      Malek is a talented person and he has already competed in international competitions, but this time if he does his best efforts, God willing, I am sure he can achieve great things for his country at the Olympic Games as well,  said Jawad. Comfort in Swimming Like many Afghans, Mohammad has been caught in the increasing global tensions as fighting sends hundreds and thousands fleeing. His prosthetic legs have begun to wear after eight years, and a clinic in the United States has offered to provide treatment. Slideshow (6 Images)Mohammad's application for an American visa was denied last year, however, with the State Department saying he had not proved that he would willingly return to Afghanistan. He is working to reapply for a visa, but with several high-profile cases of Afghans using visas to seek asylum in the West, it is not clear that he will be able to get the treatment he needs. No matter what happens, Mohammad says the pool has become a comforting place, because in the water it does not matter that he lost his legs.  Winning or losing the game is not important for me because this is a pride for me that despite losing my legs I can swim and feel myself relaxed in the water,  he said. He has become a minor celebrity in Afghanistan and internationally, proudly mentioning the time he met former U.S. president George H.W. Bush. Mohammad and his family still express surprise at how his potentially life-ending injury changed his life.  I was hopeless and crying,  said his mother, Bibi Sabza Gul.  Imagine when you see your son lose two legs and covered with blood.  Now those horrible memories have faded, she said.  I'm really happy seeing my son improving day by day in his career. He is helping his sisters and brothers and encouraging them in sports so I am not concerned about him anymore.

May's Conservative Party, which failed to win a majority in last week's British general election, has been talking to Northern Ireland's largest party, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) to secure the support of their 10 members of parliament in Westminster. But Irish nationalists Sinn Fein have voiced concerns a tie-up could destabilize politics in Northern Ireland and undermine the British government's neutrality in overseeing talks to form a new power-sharing government for the province. Northern Ireland's power-sharing administration, created under a 1998 Good Friday Agreement peace deal, collapsed in January and talks have been going on since a regional election in March to restore it.  Sinn Fein has said it does not want the DUP to put forward its leader Arlene Foster as first minister until the results of a corruption probe are finalised.

Sinn Fein, which won seven seats in the British parliament at last week's election but will maintain its policy of not taking them, said its leader in Northern Ireland, Michelle, O'Neill would repeat those concerns in London on Thursday.  It's imperative that both governments recommit to the word, spirit and implementation of the Good Friday Agreement if there is to be any prospect of re-establishing the Executive,  O'Neill said in a statement. The Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP), the Ulster Unionists and the Alliance Party - which all failed to win any seats in the general election - said they would also meet May.  May's office said Northern Ireland's five main parties would take part, but a spokesman for the DUP did not immediately respond to a request to confirm their participation. âThe context in which the talks process is now being asked to operate could have very serious consequences if there is any suggestion of a back room deal with the DUP.

There's more concern, but it's not general concern about risk, it's more focused on the diminishing expectations for the Trump administration agenda,  said Kristina Hooper, global market strategist for Invesco Ltd (IVZ.N), in New York. Hooper said Comey's testimony offered further evidence that Congress is  distracted  and unlikely to pass market-friendly legislation of the scope initially expected.  It's almost like sand running through your finger watching the agenda come to fruition.  The period measured by the ICI did not include the dramatic shift on Friday and Monday from technology stocks into banks and other sectors.  If there was some sign that the economy was in trouble, I'd be worried,  said Ted Theodore, chief investment officer at TrimTabs Asset Management LLC in New York. Theodore said investors are still scarred by the 2008 financial crisis and are ready to quickly sell an investment that stalls.

China on Wednesday approved two new varieties of genetically modified (GMO) crops for import from June 12, including Dow's Enlist corn, engineered to combat weeds resistant to the widely used herbicide glyphosate, which is the main ingredient in Monsanto's popular Roundup herbicide. China, the top export market for U.S. agricultural products, had pledged in May to speed up a review of biotech products as part of a trade deal with the United States, expediting eight products that have been pending for more than four years. Along with Enlist corn, Monsanto's Vistive Gold soybeans were also approved for import, the Ministry of Agriculture said in a statement.  We're very pleased to see the progress that's being made, that's been catalyzed by the discussions between the U.S. government and the Chinese government,  said Joe Vertin, global leader for Dow's Enlist Weed Control System. The Enlist platform is Dow AgroScience's largest-ever product launch and key to reaching its forecast for boosting seed sales by $600 million by 2020. Dow's Enlist soybeans are still being reviewed by officials in China and the European Union. The approvals of new GMO imports follow an agreement on protocols for shipments of U.S. beef to China that was also promised under the broader trade deal last month. China does not permit the planting of genetically modified food crops but does allow GMO imports, such as soybeans, for use in its animal feed industry.  Getting a new GMO crop variety approved for import by China takes around six years, compared with under three in other major markets, forcing leading agrichemical players to restrict sales during China's review process.  We are aware of the latest updates of the approval process and are encouraged by the fast progress that the Chinese government has made,  said a spokeswoman for DuPont Pioneer, which is awaiting approval for an insect-tolerant corn.  We look forward to more products getting approval.  The agriculture ministry said it had also renewed import approvals for 14 other GMO varieties including Syngenta's MIR162 Agrisure Viptera corn, a Monsanto sugar beet and three Bayer rapeseed products.  The approvals were for a three-year period lasting to 2020, the statement said. Shares of Dow fell 1.1 percent and Monsanto was barely changed at midday.

The Perkins School for the Blind aims to work with governments to train specialist teachers who can meet the complex needs of these children and young adults. Many lack educational opportunities and are often left at home, or put into orphanages and care facilities in poorer countries. âThis is one of the most vulnerable populations in the world,â said Dave Power, chief executive of the Massachusetts-based school, which taught deaf and blind writer Helen Keller.  âMore than 90 percent of these children do not get an education - either because they donât have the right to an education, or the school system theyâre in doesnât know how to teach them and reach them,â he said by telephone.  The school recently piloted its teacher training program in Argentina and India. It can be adapted to different languages and cultures, although the multi-sensory core curriculum for children who are blind, or deaf and blind works globally.  Conducting teacher training program online will help limit the cost, which Perkins expects to be covered by government budgets and bolstered by grants.  Power noted that in 2015 all countries signed up to the Sustainable Development Goals, which include a goal of inclusive, quality education for all and aim to ensure training for people with disabilities, boost their social participation and create equally paid jobs for them.  âWeâre ready to work with any ministry of education that really wants to make progress in a measurable way to reach this population,â said Power. As well as bringing children into the education system and potentially boosting their job prospects, the program will also give their parents a chance to work more hours and improve their economic situation, said Michael Delaney, executive director of Perkinsâ international unit. Highlighting the case of an orphanage in Indonesia where children with multiple disabilities had been kept in their beds all day but are now being educated and becoming part of the local community, Delaney said increasing public and government awareness was crucial. Perkins is now working with Mexicoâs government to implement a teacher training program, and looking at options in Central America and Brazil. âIn Latin America, weâre very over-protective,â said Daniela Gissara, an educational specialist with Perkins International. âWe think if we keep children with multiple disabilities at home, weâre doing good for them.â âThese children can have productive and successful lives, and can be independent as the rest, if they get the appropriate education,â she added.

Mediaset won the last auction in 2014 for the right to air Europe's biggest soccer competition, paying just under 700 million euros ($789 million) for three seasons, raising its cost base but giving it an advantage over rival Sky. Sky Italia said in a statement it had won exclusive rights to air over 340 matches of Champions League and Europa League matches for three seasons starting in 2018, confirming an earlier Reuters report. Although the group did not say how much it had offered, a source close to the matter said Sky's Italian subsidiary won with a bid of between 270-290 million euros per season. The source added that Mediaset's rival bid was in excess of the 227 million euros per season it offered last time, without giving a precise figure. A separate source told Reuters the winning bid by Sky Italia was around 260 million euros per season, including Europa League matches. Sky Italia Chief Executive Andrea Zappia said in a statement he was  very happy with the result (of the tender)... which reinforces Sky's position in sports programming in Italy . The group has 4.8 million subscribers in Italy. Losing Ground Mediaset said in a statement its offer was  important but rational  and higher than the one offered in the past auction, but it did not disclose the amount.  Other operators attributed a higher value to the European competition ... with the aim of gaining a dominating position in the pay-TV market,  the statement added. Mediaset's pay-TV brand Premium has 2 million subscribers who are mainly drawn to its sports channels but it has failed to add enough customers to offset the money spent on the broadcasting rights for the 2015-2018 season. In January, Mediaset, which is controlled by the family of former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, said it was ready to scale down Premium and stop showing soccer matches if they became too costly. It said it would bid for the Champions League rights but only with an  opportunistic approach , to ensure the sustainability of its business. Mediaset failed to sell its pay-TV business to France's Vivendi last year, dragging the company into the red and prompting its management to rethink its strategy for the loss-making channel. In Britain, Sky was beaten by BT, which retained the Champions League rights by agreeing to pay 1.2 billion pounds ($1.5 billion), nearly a third more than the previous auction. But in Germany, Sky Deutschland secured a sub-licence deal with digital content and media provider Perform Group to show UEFA's games in the country from next year. In France, Vivendi's pay-TV business was beaten to the Champions League rights by a 350 million euros per year bid from Altice, putting it under further pressure.

Nearly 90 percent of its population are foreign guest workers, mostly from South Asia or poorer countries in the Middle East. Dubai offers lower costs and shorter shipping times than many other ports in the Middle East. But Oman's Sohar port has been trying to compete by expanding its capacity. Business from Qatar could help that effort.

Enis Berberoglu, the first CHP lawmaker to be handed prison time since the lifting of parliamentary immunities last year, was accused of giving an opposition newspaper video purporting to show Turkey's intelligence agency trucking weapons into Syria. CHP leader Kemal Kilicdaroglu said he would launch a march in protest against the conviction at an Ankara park on Thursday. Party officials said the march would head to Istanbul.  We are in the days where the actual guilty are not tried, but the innocent are,  he told reporters.  I will be in Guvenpark at 11 am (4.00 a.m. ET) tomorrow and we will begin our march until democracy and justice come to this country.  A report in the secular Cumhuriyet newspaper in May 2015 said that trucks allegedly owned by Turkey's state intelligence service were found to contain weapons and ammunition that were headed for Syria when they were stopped and searched in southern Turkey in early 2014.  The defendant has committed the crime of disclosing information that should remain secret for state security, domestic and external benefits, with the aim of political and military espionage,  the court document seen by Reuters said. The government has denied accusations that weapons were sent to Syria, saying the trucks were carrying humanitarian aid.

This decision is intimidation of the opposition. This decision is intimidation of all who are displeased with the AKP,  Altay told reporters outside the Istanbul court house, referring to President Tayyip Erdogan's ruling party. Following Cumhuriyet's report, Erdogan acknowledged the trucks belonged to the National Intelligence Organization (MIT), and said they were carrying aid to Turkmens battling Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and Islamic State.

Last year, Dundar and Gul were sentenced to at least five years in jail for revealing state secrets in a related case, and the prosecutor is now seeking an additional 10 years in prison for the two over the report on the trucks. Hurriyet Daily News editor Murat Yetkin noted Wednesday's ruling came as Turkey already faced pressure because of the jailing of journalists and politicians.  Rulings like this are likely to weaken the position of President Recep Tayyip ErdoÄan and the AK Party government in their diplomatic ventures, especially with the West,  he wrote. Rights groups and Turkey's Western allies have complained of deteriorating human rights under Erdogan, and a crackdown following last July's failed coup has seen 50,000 people jailed pending trial and some 150,000 detained or dismissed.

Businesses in Qatar say they are pulling the plug on UAE and Saudi contracts, and don't expect to resume them even if the diplomatic storm blows over.  We are not working with them again. They didn't honour their agreements. Our products are being held up there,  said Ahmed al-Khalaf, chairman of International Projects Development Co. and owner of a Qatari meat processing plant that imports materials from the UAE.  We may not have many factories in Qatar but we have the money to buy from other sources.  Qatar is the world's richest country per capita, with just 2.7 million residents and income from the world's biggest exports of liquefied natural gas. Nearly 90 percent of its population are foreign guest workers, mostly from South Asia or poorer countries in the Middle East. Dubai offers lower costs and shorter shipping times than many other ports in the Middle East. But Oman's Sohar port has been trying to compete by expanding its capacity. Business from Qatar could help that effort. On Monday Qatar launched two new shipping services to Omani ports as the gas-rich country seeks to secure food supplies closed off by the Saudi-led boycott.

House of Representatives Speaker Ali Abdelaal said the required majority of lawmakers had voted for the agreement, which the government signed last year, despite a court striking it down in March.  I announce the House's final approval of the maritime demarcation agreement with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia signed on April 8, 2016,  Abdelaal said before adjourning the session. The treaty must now be ratified by President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, which is a formality. The vote came very swiftly. The House Committee on Defence and National Security unanimously backed the plan earlier on Wednesday and referred it to the House for a final vote. A majority approved it less than four hours later. Those opposed to the measure stood up in protest and chanted  Egyptian, Egyptian  in reference to the islands.  Today is a terrible day for the Egyptian people, one in which the nation has lost part of its land,  said lawmaker Haitham al-Hariri.  Several legislators opposed to the deal threatened to hold an open-ended sit-in. Some said they were considering resigning in protest. Sisi's government last year announced the maritime demarcation agreement with Saudi Arabia, which has given billions of dollars of aid to Egypt, ceding control of the islands of Tiran and Sanafir. The plan triggered street protests last year from many Egyptians, who say their country's sovereignty over the islands dates back to a treaty from 1906, before Saudi Arabia was founded. Dozens of protesters gathered in downtown Cairo outside the press union on Tuesday evening. Eight were arrested, including three journalists, and are being held for 24 hours to be questioned on accusations of illegally protesting and insulting the president, according to state news agency MENA. The Egyptian and Saudi governments say the islands are Saudi but have been subject to Egyptian protection since 1950 at the request of Saudi Arabia. Jurisdiction Spat The treaty has been referred to the courts, irritating Riyadh and raising tensions between two Arab allies.  Egypt's highest administrative court blocked the deal but parliament insisted the matter was constitutionally within its domain.  Parliamentary leaders and government lawyers say the House of Representatives is the only entity allowed to rule on matters of sovereignty while the Supreme Administrative Court insists it is within its jurisdiction to scrap the deal. The Supreme Constitutional Court will rule on who has jurisdiction but has not set a date or even started discussing the issue. It was not immediately clear what the legal situation of the treaty was following Wednesday's vote. A government report advising parliament on the terms of the agreement said Egypt would keep administrative control over the islands and Egyptians would not need visas to visit them if they were transferred to Saudi Arabia. Opposition groups accuse Sisi of handing over the islands to please his Saudi backers and in return for continued aid.  Saudi Arabia was Sisi's biggest international supporter when he led the military in ousting an elected but unpopular Islamist president in 2013 following mass protests.

Thirty-eight years later, his youngest child became the once-staunchly Catholic country's first openly gay prime minister, its first of Indian descent and the youngest person ever to hold the office. Varadkar's election in parliament on Wednesday, 10 days after he succeeded Enda Kenny as leader of the governing Fine Gael party, marks another symbolic moment for Ireland.  If my election today shows anything, it is that prejudice has no hold in this Republic,  Varadkar said to huge applause on June 2 after winning the leadership of the center-right party.  I know when my father traveled 5,000 miles to build a new home in Ireland, I doubt that he ever dreamed that one day his son would grow up to be its leader and despite his differences, his son would be judged by his actions not his identity.   Every proud parent in Ireland today can dream big dreams for their children,  Varadkar said. The fact the milestone of electing a gay premier is barely mentioned in local media and has taken place -- in the words of one former government minister --  without anybody batting an eyelid  shows just how far Ireland has come. Instead, after six years of Kenny's steady stewardship, the focus has been on the stark change of style likely to follow the election of a minister known as a straight talker. Colleagues giddily proclaim that their new leader has the 'X Factor'. 'Once-in-a-Generation Politician' Varadkar had not been born when Kenny, 66, was first elected as a member of parliament and comes from the generation hit hardest by Ireland's economic meltdown. He owned an apartment that fell into negative equity at the turn of the decade. Leo Varadkar is congratulated by colleagues as he leaves Government buildings after being elected by parliamentary vote as the next Prime Minister of Ireland (Taoiseach) to replace Enda Kenny in Dublin, Ireland June 14, 2017.Clodagh KilcoyneHe will also be a year younger than France's Emmanuel Macron when he attends his first EU leaders summit later this month. But Varadkar has been quick to point out that the favorite to become Austria's new prime minister, Sebastian Kurz, is eight years younger.  He's a once-in-a-generation politician,  said Fine Gael member of parliament Jim Daly, echoing the comments of most of his colleagues who have placed high hopes in Varadkar. Such a dramatic change of style could go two ways, analysts warn. Varadkar's tendency to shoot from the hip can backfire. As a novice minister he said Ireland would likely need a second bailout six months after signing its 2010 EU/IMF package. Colleagues were furious and Ireland went on to exit the bailout on schedule in 2013. Slideshow (2 Images) When you're Taoiseach (prime minister), you can't speak as open and freely as when you're a maverick, straight-shooting minister. If he doesn't temper his more colorful contributions, that could actually become a liability quite quickly,  said Theresa Reidy, a politics lecturer at University College Cork. She said that although he has held three cabinet post since 2011, Varadkar is relatively inexperienced. With the exception of Kenny, every prime minister since the 1960s either served as finance or foreign minister prior to taking office. Kenny sat in parliament for 35 years before his elevation. Varadkar was first elected in 2007. Seen as being on the right wing of the centrist Fine Gael, Varadkar also upset Ireland's left with a recent publicity campaign highlighting social welfare fraud. And his management style will be tested by Fine Gael's weak minority government that is backed by independent lawmakers and facilitated by the main opposition party.  As someone who once described himself as not being  a natural people's person , the trained doctor will need a good bedside manner.  We don't really know how he will react under pressure and it is different when you're Taoiseach,  Reidy said.

Some residents asleep inside were trapped in the inferno. The causes of the fire, one of the biggest in London in memory, were not immediately known. Here are some details on the block's history. Grenfell Tower, a 24-storey apartment block in North Kensington, West London, was completed in 1974.  It originally contained 120 apartments, though seven more were added in refurbishment. It is managed by Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organization (KCTMO) on behalf of Kensington and Chelsea London Borough Council. A 8.7 million pound ($11 million) refurbishment of the block was carried out by construction company Rydon and completed in July 2016. It included new external cladding, replacement windows and curtain wall facades, according to Rydon's website. A new communal heating system and a bespoke smoke extraction and ventilation system were also installed. Rydon said it was shocked to hear of the devastating fire and its immediate thoughts were with those affected. The company said its refurbishment of the building met all required building control, fire regulation and health & safety standards.    We will cooperate with the relevant authorities and emergency services and fully support their enquiries into the causes of this fire at the appropriate time,  the company said in a statement. The cladding work was carried out by Harley Facades in a contract valued at 2.6 million pounds, according to its website. A spokesman for Harley said the company could not comment at this stage because it did not have information about the fire.    The Grenfell Action Group, set up in 2010 to oppose the redevelopment of a nearby green space, said it had warned repeatedly about the fire safety standards at Grenfell Tower.  All our warnings fell on deaf ears and we predicted that a catastrophe like this was inevitable and just a matter of time,  the group said on its website on Wednesday. KCTMO had told tower residents to  stay put  in their apartments in the event of a fire, unless the fire was in their home or in the hallway outside.  This is because Grenfell was designed according to rigorous fire safety standards,  KCTMO said in a newsletter to residents in July 2014.   Also, the new front doors for each flat can withstand a fire for up to 30 minutes, which gives plenty of time for the fire brigade to arrive.

A campaign to oust Islamic State militants from the northern Syrian city of Raqqa began last week by the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a group of Kurdish and Arab militias supported by a U.S.-led coalition.  Iraqi forces also supported by the coalition have been trying since October to oust the militants from Iraq's Mosul city, the other main city controlled by Islamic State.   White phosphorus munitions can legally be used on battlefields to make smoke screens, generate illumination, mark targets or burn bunkers and buildings. Because it has legal uses, white phosphorus is not banned as a chemical weapon under international conventions, but it can cause serious burns and start fires.    No matter how white phosphorus is used, it poses a high risk of horrific and long-lasting harm in crowded cities like Raqqa and Mosul and any other areas with concentrations of civilians,  said Steve Goose, arms director at Human Rights Watch.       U.S.-led forces should take all feasible precautions to minimize civilian harm when using white phosphorus in Iraq and Syria,  he said.  Also on Wednesday in Geneva, United Nations war crimes investigators said intensified coalition air strikes supporting an assault by U.S.-backed forces on Islamic State's stronghold of Raqqa in Syria were causing a  staggering loss of civilian life . Human Rights Watch said it was not able to independently verify whether the use of the munitions resulted in any civilian casualties, but said it was concerned about its use in populated areas.   The international human rights organization said white phosphorus causes severe and often fatal burns.    White phosphorus fragments can exacerbate wounds even after treatment and can enter the bloodstream and cause multiple organ failure. Already dressed wounds can reignite when dressings are removed and they are re-exposed to oxygen,  Human Rights Watch said.  U.S. Army Colonel Ryan Dillon, a spokesman for the U.S.-led coalition fighting Islamic State, said the coalition does not discuss the use of specific weapons, when asked about phosphorus use by Reuters.    In accordance with the law of armed conflict white phosphorus rounds are used for screening, obscuring, and marking in a way that fully considers the possible incidental effects on civilians and civilian structures,  Col. Dillon said in an emailed statement.   However, ISIS continues its blatant disregard for innocent human life by killing civilians trying to flee the fighting and the Coalition will not stand idly by and allow civilians to die needlessly if we can help protect them,  he said.    On Wednesday, United Nations war crimes investigators said that the intensified coalition air strikes on Raqqa were causing a  staggering loss of civilian life .  Residents as well as the campaign group Raqqa is Being Silently Slaughtered and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights war monitor also say air strikes have killed significant numbers of civilians.  The U.S.-led coalition says it investigates any allegations of civilian deaths and is careful to avoid civilian casualties in its bombing in Syria and Iraq.

The SDF, supported by heavy coalition air strikes, have taken territory to the west, east and north of the city.  Coalition air strikes have intensified around the city,  said Paulo Pinheiro, chairman of the U.N. Commission of Inquiry.   As the operation is gaining pace very rapidly, civilians are caught up in the city under the oppressive rule of ISIL, while facing extreme danger associated with movement due to excessive air strikes,  he told reporters.

The manner of Fitchâs factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitchâs ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts.

The men, Robert Dolinski, 38, Andrzej Laskowski, 37, and Kewin Laskowski, 19, all pleaded guilty to modern slavery offences at Leeds Crown Court in northeastern England.  The sentenced ranged from 12 months to more than three years. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said the captives had their identification documents and bank cards confiscated, and were forced to repay costs incurred for their housing and transportation into the country.  One man who tried to escape was beaten, while another was punched for refusing to decorate his flat, CPS said.  The treatment of these vulnerable people was shocking. Every aspect of their lives was controlled ... and faced the threat of violence if they failed to comply,  senior Crown Prosecutor Jim Hope said in a statement.  The victims lived and worked alongside colleagues in factories and warehouses and yet were so terrified, they were extremely reluctant to tell anyone about their plight,  he said. Two women, Maria Pawlowska, 34, and Agnieszka Laskowska, 34, admitted fraud, but were released having already served the six months they were given, the CPS said.  There are an estimated 13,000 victims of forced labor, sexual exploitation and domestic servitude in Britain. In 2015 the UK passed tough anti-slavery legislation introducing life sentences for traffickers and forcing companies to disclose what they are doing to make sure their supply chains are free from slavery. Last month, four men were also convicted for trafficking Polish workers into Britain, tricking them into low-paid jobs and taking their wages.

The Kashiwazaki-Kariwa plant, the world's biggest nuclear power plant, has been completely offline since 2012 while its safety procedures are reviewed. Ryuichi Yoneyama, the governor of Niigata prefecture in north west Japan where the plant is located, has said he will not discuss the restart until the review is completed. This includes a review of the plant's safety, evacuation plans, plus the impact on health of the radiation released from Fukushima, which could take until 2020 at the earliest.  We will cooperate with the review,  incoming CEO Tomoaki Kobayakawa, told reporters on Wednesday. Tepco presented several options for restarting the plant in a business plan approved last month, including restarting two of its seven reactors by March 2020. Kobayakawa said profits from restarting the plant would provide a big source of funds to fulfill Tepco's responsibility for Fukushima and improve the company's value. Tepco's restructuring plan is designed to cut costs and boost earnings to repay the bulk of the estimated 21.5 trillion yen bill from the Fukushima disaster. The plan last month was the third proposed in the last six years and depends on generating revenue by resuming output from Kashiwazaki-Kariwa.

He takes over at a difficult time for the company, whose share of the bill for the Fukushima nuclear disaster, has more than doubled to about 16 trillion yen ($145 billion). Tepco is aiming to allocate 500 billion yen in annual profits in coming decades to pay for decommissioning and compensation. Tepco also wants to reorganize and find domestic partners for its power transmission and nuclear power businesses within 10 years. But finding partners is expected to be difficult, as some utilities have ruled out any nuclear tie-ups with Tepco, which is controlled by the government. Kobayakawa said the reorganization will not be possible without a finding a partner.  We would like to make proposals after carefully determining what kinds of new value or savings would be created.  He also said Tepco hoped to expand overseas to offset declining domestic power demand. Kobayakawa said 1.6 billion people globally are estimated to have no electricity, half of them in Africa, which could be a big opportunity. He said that he did not rule out the possibility of an initial public offering of fuel venture with Chubu Electric, JERA, in future to help to raise funds for further expansion.

If people with obstructive sleep apnea don't use machines at night to help keep the airway open, measures of their heart health and blood sugar worsen, researchers found.  One of the longstanding debates in our field  is whether sleep apnea actually causes heart issues and problems with blood sugar,  or if theyâre just associated,  said senior author Dr. Jonathan Jun, of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.          In obstructive sleep apnea, the airway intermittently collapses or becomes blocked during sleep. The blocked airway causes pauses in breathing. In the past, researchers have tried to find a direct link between sleep apnea, heart health and blood sugar by comparing patients instructed to use CPAP machines at night to keep the airway open with patients who were instructed to sleep without using these machines. But one of the major issues with those studies is that people may not actually use the CPAP machine, Jun told Reuters Health by phone. For the new study, the researchers recruited 31 people with moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea who were known to regularly use their CPAP machines. The participants slept two nights in the lab, using their CPAP on only one of the nights. The researchers obtained blood samples while participants slept.  We are looking at real time changes,  said Jun.  Weâre getting blood every 20 minutes.  As reported in The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism, on the night without CPAP, patients' obstructive sleep apnea returned. On those nights, patients had low levels of oxygen in their blood, poor sleep and an increased heart rate. Additionally, their blood samples showed increases in fatty acids, sugar and a stress hormone known as cortisol. The researchers also saw increases in blood pressure and in arterial stiffness, which has been linked with a risk for heart problems.  These were obese patients and patients with relatively severe sleep apnea. They also had other medical problems,  Jun pointed out. People who fit that description may be experiencing the same changes during the night if they sleep without their CPAP machine, he said. Glucose and fatty acids rose in the overall group without the CPAP machines, but participants with diabetes may be more vulnerable to the glucose elevation, Jun warned. He said the study can't say what would happen to people with milder sleep apnea. Because obesity has been tied to an increased risk of sleep apnea, it's been difficult to know if itâs the sleep apnea or the obesity itself thatâs causing those problems, Jun noted.  The new study, he said,  advances that idea that other conditions and not obesity itself are driver of those levels.

EU officials have piled pressure on VW to compensate European customers after it admitted to U.S. regulators in September 2015 that it had cheated on emissions tests there using software installed in as many as 11 million diesel vehicles sold worldwide - the majority of them in Europe. Despite VW's admission of wrongdoing in the United States, it says it has not broken the law in Europe and sees no need to compensate consumers there. VW's chief executive Matthias Mueller told the EU's commissioner for consumer affairs earlier this week that the company would now offer European customers a two-year extended warranty, the Commission spokesman said. However, commenting on the talks with the commissioner, Vera Jourova, Volkswagen did not confirm that it had agreed to extend its guarantee. The company instead referred back to earlier  confidence-building measures  including a commitment to fix all vehicles affected by this autumn, saying that updating the software would not detract from the car's performance. People pass in front of a Volkswagen logo at Shanghai Auto Show during its media day, in Shanghai, China April 19, 2017.Aly Song Volkswagen has said all along that it cares for every customer,  it said in an email on Wednesday.  An extended warranty offer would be the first concession made by the company in response to mounting pressure from Brussels to do more for its diesel customers following months of talks with EU officials and more than a year after the Dieselgate scandal broke. Jourova and other EU regulators have repeatedly expressed frustration over VW's attitude to European customers in not offering the cash payouts granted to U.S. owners of its cars. But the European Union is limited in what it can do to pressure the company since the power to police the car industry currently lies with member states, which approve new car models that are then sold throughout the bloc. Unlike the United States, a patchwork of different legal rules across the Europe Union also weakens the chances of car owners successfully suing carmakers.

The bill toughens sanctions for thieves and curbs the publication of wiretaps in investigations. The most contentious aspect involves lengthening the statute of limitations, which imposes deadlines on courts to complete legal proceedings. An estimated 1.5 million cases have had to be dropped in Italy over the past 10 years, including thousands of trials involving alleged corruption, because of the limited time given to magistrates to prosecute suspects.  I am very satisfied because it has been a very tiring, tortuous process,  Justice Minister Andrea Orlando said in parliament. Both defense lawyers and prosecutors have criticized various aspects of the bill, which was presented to parliament in 2014, and the government finally overcame deep-seated political resistance thanks to a confidence motion in the lower house. The vote was won by 320 to 149, with one abstention, giving a boost to Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni, who has vowed to plow ahead with the government's reform program following the resignation of his predecessor Matteo Renzi in December. FILE PHOTO: Italy's Minister of Justice Andrea Orlando arrives for a confidence vote at the Senate in Rome February 24, 2014.Remo Casilli/File PhotoUniquely among advanced countries, Italy's statute of limitations starts from the moment an alleged crime is committed rather than from the point it is discovered, and the time limit is not extended when a defendant is indicted or sentenced. Suspects have a right to two appeals in Italy and are not deemed guilty until the final court ruling is delivered, with trials often dragging on for many years, with lawyers looking to prolong proceedings to bring down the limitations guillotine. FILE PHOTO: A general view of a courtroom at Rome's Justice Palace at the beginning of a trial.Alessandro Di Meo/Pool/File PhotoProsecutors say it is all but impossible to reach a definitive verdict for most financial crimes within the prescribed time frame, which is seldom more than eight years. This is a major reason why, according to data issued by the Council of Europe, just 1 percent of inmates in Italian prisons are there for white collar crimes. That is one of the lowest rates in Europe and compares with 12 percent in Germany. Under the reform, the statute of limitations would be suspended for 18 months between an initial conviction and the start of a first appeal, and suspended for another 18 months after a second conviction before the final appeal begins. The changes are considered inadequate by many prosecutors, who say the time limit should be scrapped as soon as police open investigations into a suspect, as happens in Britain, or when a suspect is sent to trial, as in the United States. On the other hand, many center-right politicians opposed any curbs on the statute of limitations, saying the legal system needed to be made more efficient and defendants should not face increased uncertainty over their fate.

The document, seen by Reuters, appears to challenge rules on bank failure in force since last year and that aimed to stop taxpayers having to rescue failed banks by mandating that bondholders, shareholders and uninsured depositors bare the brunt of any losses.  The rules have been criticized by Italy, which reached a preliminary deal with the EU this month for an exception so it could use public money to rescue Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena (BMPS.MI), the country's fourth biggest lender. Many Italian banks have a high number of retail investors, and the government wants to protect them from losing all of their investments when a lender fails.  Germany has previously been a staunch defender of the rules that it helped shape after the 2010-2012 euro zone debt crisis.  Berlin now says it recognizes the social impact may need to be considered when a bank is put under  resolution , the EU procedure to liquidate a failing lender that was applied for the first time in the case of Spain's Banco Popular when it was rescued last week by Santander (SAN.MC).  In the joint paper, Germany said banks' customers were diversified and  in some cases deserve more protection  as they were not always well informed about risks of bank failure.  This may also have an impact on the way resolution is managed due to the different social impact,  the paper said. Current rules only focus on protecting financial stability and reducing costs for taxpayers. Bail-in rules have never been fully applied so far. The resolution of Popular spared depositors and senior bondholders. Italy is now in talks with the EU on a rescue plan for two struggling banks - Veneto Banca and Popolare di Vicenza.

We are looking into this application for a guarantee along with the states of North Rhine-Westphalia and Berlin,  a ministry spokeswoman told reporters. She added that presenting a  sustainable concept for the future  was key to getting such a guarantee. Air Berlin's CEO Thomas Winkelmann said on Wednesday it was a  confidential figure  when asked for details of the airline's request for loan guarantees from the two German states.  We're not looking for any kind of taxpayers' money. We don't want to be state-owned. As management, we look at every opportunity over how to restructure the company, and that includes restructuring the debt,  he told Reuters after the carrier's annual general meeting in London. The German carrier, 29 percent-owned by Abu Dhabi-based carrier Etihad, last week asked Berlin and North-Rhine Westphalia (NRW) to consider loan guarantees. German Economics Minister Brigitte Zypries said on Tuesday that the airline was in a  precarious  situation.

Winkelmann joined Air Berlin in February 2017, and said on arrival that his aim was to reposition the company. Last year, the carrier made a record net loss of 782 million euros after it faced increased competition from leaner rivals for its traditional routes to Spanish holiday destinations.  Winkelmann has previously said that Air Berlin is seeking a partner, and larger rival Lufthansa, which last year agreed a long-term deal to lease 38 planes and crew from Air Berlin, is seen as the obvious investor.   Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr had previously expressed interest in Air Berlin on the condition that its debt pile and costs could be brought down. Travel agencies, monopoly experts and rival carrier Ryanair have also raised competition concerns over any possible takeover of Air Berlin by Lufthansa.

Ethylene, a flammable gas, is the main feedstock used to synthesize the most commonly used plastics, found in the vast majority of all manufactured goods. It is produced in refineries from natural gas or crude oil, as one of the main products of the $400 billion global petrochemicals industry. When manufacturers buy and sell plastic, a benchmark of the ethylene price is often written into their purchase contracts, to reflect the raw material cost. But the European index is unregulated and, the sources said, has overstated the actual price for the past four years because it does not take into account the now common practice of firms negotiating rebates. The sources include one person at a petrochemical company and three people who research the industry. The actual price companies charge each other for the chemical is secret, and companies tend to offer big clients discounts from the benchmark to reflect economies of scale, local market conditions, or other factors. But those discounts have grown, making the benchmark a less accurate reflection of the real costs. Companies do not have to pass the rebates on to their customers further down the supply chain, who are contractually obliged to pay prices based on the higher benchmark. Reuters was unable to assess the degree to which the practice has hurt manufacturers of goods made from plastics. More than 10 companies that buy or sell ethylene, contacted by Reuters, declined to discuss their pricing, including any rebates they offer or receive. Most of the sources that spoke to Reuters said they did not believe rebates had made the market unfair. But they say the lack of transparency, and the divergence between the published benchmark and the true price, could create the potential for suppliers to overcharge customers who may be unaware of the practice.  There's an understanding that this is not a perfect process,  said Matthew Thoelke, senior director of olefins and derivatives at analysis firm IHS. The sources said the petrochemical companies that participate in setting the ethylene contract price while giving or receiving rebates include Europe's biggest, such as BASF, Royal Dutch Shell, Total and LyondellBasell. BASF, Shell and Total declined to comment on their pricing. LyondellBasell did not respond to Reuters request for comment. Level Playing Field The benchmark for the price of ethylene used in nearly all European contracts is produced by the Independent Chemical Information Service, or ICIS, which has published its  ethylene contract price  since 1980. ICIS is now a unit of Reed Business Information. Thomson Reuters, parent company of Reuters, competes with Reed as a supplier of benchmark prices for other commodities but does not publish a rival index price for ethylene. ICIS senior editor Nel Weddle said the benchmark, published after confirming agreements with at least four companies who buy and sell ethylene, allows everyone to start on a  level playing field  with knowledge of prices. However, the figures it uses to compile the index do not include rebates off the benchmark price. ICIS said it is not responsible for collecting information about such rebates, which it called  a common part of any supply or purchase contract . Although ICIS is the most widely used benchmark in Europe, it is not the only one. A competitor, Argus, publishes a rival index, which also does not take rebates into account. It declined to comment. Another competitor, Platts, has launched a new rival index which it says will better reflect the true market price by taking into account the rebates. The sources familiar with the practice said refineries began offering substantial rebates in 2013 to clear their stocks during a period of oversupply of ethylene. But instead of being a temporary measure to deal with local market conditions, the rebates grew after oil and gas prices tumbled in 2014, and have continued to widen since. The contract price of ethylene has hovered around 850-1,050 euros per tonne over the past year, down from a range of 1,200-1,300 euros before oil and gas prices fell in 2014. Rebates now run at more than 100 euros a tonne, the sources said. One of the sources, at a major research consultancy, said his firm's staff use their own contacts at chemical companies to get a sense of the secret rebates. The rebates are now a key to understanding the profitability of businesses in the sector, which is therefore harder to forecast solely from public data. Weddle of ICIS said the company was not aware of complaints from users of its benchmark about its omission of the rebates. However, last year ICIS conducted a review of its methodology and posted feedback online from some users of the index. One of three respondents whose views ICIS posted wrote that the published prices should begin to reflect rebates.  Otherwise, the reported contract prices do not reflect the real market situation and especially smaller suppliers and consumers are left in the dark,  the respondent wrote. ICIS confirmed that the response was genuine but declined to identify who had written it. Some in the industry who spoke to Reuters sought to play down the significance of the disparity between the index and the price after rebates, saying the market is competitive enough to prevent customers who rely on the benchmark being overcharged. While Europe's benchmarks have their problems,  the situation in general is fair , said Jose Manuel Martinez, the chief executive of the Spanish oil company Cepsa's petrochemicals business. No Regulation Unlike benchmarks for crude oil or the major refined fuel products like diesel and gasoline, the ICIS benchmark for ethylene is not formally scrutinized by regulators, as ethylene contracts are not typically traded on securities exchanges. In the marketing materials for the rival Platts benchmark intended to address the problem by adjusting for rebates, Platts includes a graph comparing the contract price to what it says is its own assessment of the true price, based on the cost of raw materials, economic conditions and other fundamentals. The graph shows the ICIS contract price consistently higher than Platts' estimate from 2013 on, with the gap growing wider last year, when Platts estimates the true cost of ethylene bottomed out as low as 650 euros a tonne. Platts says the early indications from its new index have shown large buyers typically receiving rebates of 14-18 percent. The issue appears mostly confined to Europe, rather than the United States or Asia, which have more liquid markets with higher volumes of spot trade of ethylene, making prices relatively transparent.  As long as a market is liquid, the players know how to behave,  said Cepsa's Martinez.

Owned by 43-year-old artist Marcus Bracey, the gallery in Walthamstow, called 'God's Own Junkyard', houses the collection of four generations of his family who have made, bought and displayed neon works. The pieces are accompanied by kitsch memorabilia that Bracey has collected from film sets and car boot sales across Britain, leaving just enough room for a narrow winding aisle for visitors to navigate their way through the gallery.  This is my neon emporium, my museum of light, my Aladdin's cave,  Bracey told Reuters from the center of the high-ceilinged studio which runs up an electricity bill of over 700 pounds ($900) a week. Some of Bracey's works have appeared in films, including  Mission Impossible  and  Eyes Wide Shut , or decorated department stores, namely London's Selfridges, while others have been bought by celebrities such as Kate Moss. Bracey recently sold a large God Save the Queen neon sign in front of a heart-shaped British, Union Jack, flag for 58,000 pounds ($74,700) at auction to a buyer in Dubai. A replica is on display at God's Own Junkyard, which Bracey opened with his father Chris in 2008 after running out of space at home to store the family's work.

In a letter dated June 13, Sturgeon urged May to maintain Britain's membership of the EU's single market to  bring clarity, in place of the current confusion, and provide a coherent base for the UK's future relationship with the EU . She also said the Brexit negotiating team should include representatives from Britain's devolved governments. Sturgeon is one of several politicians who want to change May's mind over Brexit after the ruling Conservative Party lost its parliamentary majority in a national election last week. Britain as a whole voted to leave the EU in a referendum last June but most Scots wanted to stay in, leading Sturgeon to  push for a separate deal in the past year. Ruth Davidson, who has been in the limelight since leading  the Scottish Conservatives to a much-improved performance in last week's national election, is also seeking a softer approach to the  Hard Brexit  envisaged by many prominent Conservatives.  It is now clear that a new proposal is needed urgently to protect the economy and bring people together,  Sturgeon said in a letter posted on the Scottish government's website.  The EU itself has expressed concerns that time is passing and the UK has yet to appoint a negotiating team with a stable mandate, so close to the start of talks,  she added. Brexit talks are due to start next week. Sturgeon also asked for a cross-party advisory group and for the British government to  reflect on what the election results mean for the important of finding an outcome from Brexit that meets the needs and aspirations of all of the people and nations of the UK .  It will not be possible for the UK to effectively implement the outcome of Brexit negotiations without the co-operation of devolved governments. It is therefore essential that we are part of the negotiating process,  her letter said. Prior to the election, Sturgeon's Scottish National Party (SNP), backed by the devolved Scottish parliament, had called for a second independence referendum once the terms of the Brexit agreement were known.  That strategy has been cast into doubt however by the results in Scotland of last week's election. The SNP lost 21 seats in the British parliament, although it still won 35. The Conservatives, who had held just one seat before, added 12 for a total of 13, helping May cling to power while also changing the equation north of the border.

Walker has been out since May 20 because of a blister on his right hand.  We're comfortable knowing he's done a lot of those things we asked him to do, cleared all those hurdles we asked him to clear,  manager Torey Lovullo said.  We wanted to make sure he wasn't in a situation where he wasn't going to take a couple steps back.  RHP Randall Delgado is going from starting to relieving because of a glut of days off for Arizona in a span of 10 days.

DH Paul Goldschmidt will return to his first base post Wednesday after spending a game as a designated hitter. Because the D-Backs are playing in an American League city, they must find someone to bat for the pitcher. Manager Torey Lovullo chose Goldschmidt because it gave him a chance to keep the first baseman off the field two days in a row. Arizona was off Monday. Goldschmidt had two singles plus a two-run home run. 2B Brandon Drury had a single, home run and two doubles Tuesday when he came up in the ninth. He grounded out to second and had to settle for a four-hit evening.  He had a great day,  manager Torey Lovullo said.  It was just kind of a silent moment where he just goes out there and does his job and has great results. I know his two-run home run gave us a big boost, as did Goldy's (Paul Goldschmidt's). RF David Peralta saved Arizona from embarrassment with a game-winning home run leading off the ninth inning Tuesday night.  I know that he's probably a little disappointed with a ball or two that got away from him in right field,  manager Torey Lovullo said.  But he separated things. He came back, left on left, he pounded the ball off a very, very quality reliever to the opposite field in this stadium. That says something.  Peralta wasn't charged with errors on 1B Miguel Cabrera's two doubles but his body language said he knew they were catchable. He had three hits, including his sixth home run of the season. He hit a first-pitch fastball the opposite way, the home run landing on top of the bullpen rooms in left center. RHP Zack Greinke was nearly perfect through five innings Tuesday night but he couldn't survive the sixth. Greinke gave up just two singles through five shutout inning but was touched for six unearned runs in the sixth, getting pulled before he could get the third out.  I wanted him to complete that inning,  manager Torey Lovullo said.  I alway want our guys to walk off the mound after an inning.  Five of the six runs in the sixth scored by Detroit were charged to Greinke, but none were earned.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-diamondbacks-playerwatch-idUSMTZED6EJR9Q8W"},

Even though the Federal Reserve was almost certain to raise interest rates later in the day, disappointing retail sales and inflation numbers cast doubt on the speed of its monetary policy tightening. The STOXX 600  index fell 0.3 percent with the banks .SXEP, whose lending business gets a boost in margins when rates rise, taking off most points from the pan-European index with a fall of 1.3 percent. The oil sector .SXEP fell 1.6 percent to six-month lows as crude prices tumbled to a five-week low following data showing an unexpectedly large weekly build in U.S. gasoline inventories.

The Kashiwazaki-Kariwa plant, the world's biggest nuclear power plant, has been completely offline since 2012 while its safety procedures are reviewed. Ryuichi Yoneyama, the governor of Niigata prefecture in north west Japan where the plant is located, has said he will not discuss the restart until the review is completed. This includes a review of the plant's safety, evacuation plans, plus the impact on health of the radiation released from Fukushima, which could take until 2020 at the earliest.  We will cooperate with the review,  incoming CEO Tomoaki Kobayakawa, told reporters on Wednesday. Tepco presented several options for restarting the plant in a business plan approved last month, including restarting two of its seven reactors by March 2020. Kobayakawa said profits from restarting the plant would provide a big source of funds to fulfill Tepco's responsibility for Fukushima and improve the company's value. Tepco's restructuring plan is designed to cut costs and boost earnings to repay the bulk of the estimated 21.5 trillion yen bill from the Fukushima disaster. The plan last month was the third proposed in the last six years and depends on generating revenue by resuming output from Kashiwazaki-Kariwa.

He takes over at a difficult time for the company, whose share of the bill for the Fukushima nuclear disaster, has more than doubled to about 16 trillion yen ($145 billion). Tepco is aiming to allocate 500 billion yen in annual profits in coming decades to pay for decommissioning and compensation. Tepco also wants to reorganize and find domestic partners for its power transmission and nuclear power businesses within 10 years. But finding partners is expected to be difficult, as some utilities have ruled out any nuclear tie-ups with Tepco, which is controlled by the government. Kobayakawa said the reorganization will not be possible without a finding a partner.  We would like to make proposals after carefully determining what kinds of new value or savings would be created.  He also said Tepco hoped to expand overseas to offset declining domestic power demand. Kobayakawa said 1.6 billion people globally are estimated to have no electricity, half of them in Africa, which could be a big opportunity. He said that he did not rule out the possibility of an initial public offering of fuel venture with Chubu Electric, JERA, in future to help to raise funds for further expansion.

Developed by Physicians for Human Rights (PHR), MediCapt allows clinicians to record medical examination results digitally and photograph victims' injuries, store them online and send them directly to law enforcement officials and lawyers. In a vast nation plagued by militant violence and poor roads that restrict access to remote areas, PHR hopes the mobile app will lead to more convictions for sexual violence and help Congo to shake off its tag as  rape capital of the world.  By recording data about both victims and assailants, the app - which is currently in field testing - could also be used to detect mass violence and crimes against humanity and provide evidence for war crimes investigators, according to PHR.  It has the power to be used as an early warning system or rapid response tool, as the data could show patterns of abuses and violence,  said Karen Naimer, director of the U.S.-based PHR's program on sexual violence in conflict zones.  MediCapt could help prosecutors map trends or patterns of locations attacked, victims targeted and languages spoken and the uniform worn by assailants, Naimer told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  The app may also be used to push for war crime prosecutions with evidence of crimes that are widespread or systematic,  she said. Ethnic violence in Congo, Africa's second-largest nation, has spread and worsened since December when President Joseph Kabila refused to step down at the end of his mandate. Recent acts of violence between local militia and Congolese forces in central Congo, including the killing of civilians and foreign U.N. experts, could constitute war crimes, the International Criminal Court's prosecutor said in April. Yet the priority for PHR with MediCapt - which will be rolled out for use by doctors in eastern Congo this summer - is to ensure that it gives victims of sexual violence the security and confidence to come forward and speak out, said Naimer. Sexual violence is often seen as a by-product of years of fighting in Congo, where atrocities were blamed on soldiers and armed groups, but rape is also rife beyond the conflict zones.  While the app has the potential to highlight mass violence and human rights violations, protecting victims of sexual violence has to come first,  Naimer said.

The European Commission announced the investigations on Wednesday but did not provide details of the sales practices.  Nike is aware of the European Commission's investigation and will continue to cooperate with the authorities,  the company said. Universal Studios and Sanrio did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The EU move follows a year-long inquiry by its competition authority into e-commerce practices by 1,900 companies, part of a broader strategy to boost online trade and economic growth. The inquiry found that some companies allow their products to be sold online only by pre-selected distributors, while others use pricing restrictions and even online sales bans to block certain sellers.  We are going to examine whether the licensing and distribution practices of these three companies may be denying consumers access to wider choice and better deals in the single market,  European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said in a statement. Nike is the licence rights holder for Barcelona soccer club merchandise, while Sanrio owns the Hello Kitty brand, which adorn items ranging from stationery to clothing. Universal Studios holds the rights for movies such as Minions and Despicable Me. The new investigations would cover similar issues to those of the e-commerce inquiry, but also include licensing of rights and offline distribution.  They complement the sector inquiry and other pending investigations in so far as they aim to tackle potential barriers to online and offline cross-border trade,  a Commission spokesman said, adding that the case had been brought by the EU executive rather than following a complaint. In February EU antitrust regulators opened three investigations into online sales of consumer electronics makers, video game makers and hotels. Last week the EU announced a probe into U.S. clothing company Guess's cross-border distribution deals.

Jiri Sperl said the bank would continue to target its capital adequacy around 50-150 basis points above the regulatory minimum but declined to say whether the higher capital needs would impact the bank's dividend payouts, which have already been scaled back due to regulatory pressures. The Czech National Bank (CNB) decided on Tuesday to double the counter-cyclical buffer rate for banks to 1.0 percent as of July 2018 due to rapid credit growth. The move comes after it tightened recommendations for banks to limit the size of mortgages. Komercni Banka's minimum capital requirement will rise to 15.9 percent next year with the increase. It reported a level of 15.7 percent in the first quarter. Sperl said in an emailed statement to Reuters that the central bank's decision was a surprise.  The increase was rather surprising as it followed shortly after the recent CNBâs measures to curb mortgage growth entered into force, not allowing time to evaluate impacts of these previous measures, and given that the capital requirements for Czech banks have been already high in the context of the European Union,  Sperl said. Czech lending growth is close to the fastest since 2009 as record low interest rates spur demand, especially in housing, where low supply and cheap mortgages have driven up prices on new apartments in Prague by a fifth in the past year. Sperl said Komercni Banka, majority owned by France's Societe Generale, would continue in plans to reinforce its capital through so-called Tier 2 component. He also said the counter-cyclical buffer increase would affect all lending.  It effectively increases the cost not only of residential mortgages, but also for business investments as well as for financing of a new infrastructure construction,  he said.

The document, seen by Reuters, appears to challenge rules on bank failure in force since last year and that aimed to stop taxpayers having to rescue failed banks by mandating that bondholders, shareholders and uninsured depositors bare the brunt of any losses.  The rules have been criticized by Italy, which reached a preliminary deal with the EU this month for an exception so it could use public money to rescue Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena (BMPS.MI), the country's fourth biggest lender. Many Italian banks have a high number of retail investors, and the government wants to protect them from losing all of their investments when a lender fails.  Germany has previously been a staunch defender of the rules that it helped shape after the 2010-2012 euro zone debt crisis.  Berlin now says it recognizes the social impact may need to be considered when a bank is put under  resolution , the EU procedure to liquidate a failing lender that was applied for the first time in the case of Spain's Banco Popular when it was rescued last week by Santander (SAN.MC).  In the joint paper, Germany said banks' customers were diversified and  in some cases deserve more protection  as they were not always well informed about risks of bank failure.  This may also have an impact on the way resolution is managed due to the different social impact,  the paper said. Current rules only focus on protecting financial stability and reducing costs for taxpayers. Bail-in rules have never been fully applied so far. The resolution of Popular spared depositors and senior bondholders. Italy is now in talks with the EU on a rescue plan for two struggling banks - Veneto Banca and Popolare di Vicenza. Whatever the outcome of those talks, depositors would not be affected, a Commission spokesman said on Tuesday.

Expectations are growing for the Canadian plane-and-train-maker to announce new orders for its fuel-efficient 110-to-130 seat CSeries jets after it failed to secure any substantial orders in about a year. But even as some market observers look to showcase events like Paris, which are used to launch products and make order announcements, planemakers are bracing for softer sales in 2017 after a prolonged order boom.  I think it is a slow time period because there was this binge of orders in the last few years,  said the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the media.  Airlines are still trying to figure out their fleet plans.  Bombardier did not announce any orders for the CSeries jets at the Farnborough Airshow last year, but won key sales campaigns from Delta Air Lines (DAL.N) and Air Canada (AC.TO) in the months preceding the event. Lack of new orders could be one factor weighing on the stock which fell as much as 10 percent last Friday after the U.S International Trade Commission gave a green light to start an  anti-dumping probe against the CSeries for alleged unfair subsidies.  We are encouraged by the discussions we are having with our potential customers on all our platforms, but deals will be announced once they are signed,  Bombardier spokesman Bryan Tucker said. As of December 2016, the CSeries had recorded 360 firm orders and most capacity is sold out through 2020. Average list prices as of January, 2017 were $79.5 million for the 110-seat CS100 and $89.5 million for the 130-seat CS300, but airlines typically receive discounts of around 50 percent on aircraft. Bombardier has said it is comfortable with the company's existing CSeries sales, and head of commercial aviation Fred Cromer recently dismissed suggestions that Boeing Co (BA.N)'s anti-dumping complaint would slow orders. Cromer would not comment on the timing of orders, or expectations for Paris, which he said would serve to showcase new products. Bombardier, however, sees replacement opportunities inÂ the regional jet market âas aging planes are retired and operators shift from 50 seaters to larger regional aircraft, Tucker said.  Mesa Air Group, a Phoenix-based regional airline which operates jets by Bombardier and rival Embraer SA (EMBR3.SA), is considering the future of the CRJ-900s it ordered in the early 2000s.    We are looking at a number of fleet replacement strategies as the aircrafts are getting older,  said Mesa chief executive Jonathan Ornstein by phone last Thursday.

Oil prices fell to their lowest in more than five weeks after data showed a surprise buildup in U.S. gasoline inventories and a report from the International Energy Agency (IEA) projected an increase in non-OPEC production. The S&P; 500 energy sector sank 2.4 percent, led by declines in Exxon and Chevron. Financials fell 1.3 percent after weaker-than-expected retail sales and consumer prices data raised questions about the Fed's ability to further tighten monetary policy. While traders continued to see a more than 93 percent chance for the Fed to raise rates at the end of the two-day meeting on Wednesday, they dialed back the odds of a third hike this year.  With the weak data, you start to wonder why the Fed is so bent on raising rate. It seems they should be doing the opposite,  said Robert Pavlik, chief market strategist at Boston Private Wealth. The Fed meeting could also provide details on the central bank's plans to trim its $4.5 trillion balance sheet.  In my view there's no question that we'll get a rate hike at 2 p.m.  said Frances Donald, senior economist at Manulife Asset Management in Toronto.  What matters most in today's statement is how the Fed signals the next rate hike and perhaps, even more critically, the reduction in the balance sheet.  At 12:25 p.m. ET (1625 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 6.72 points, or 0.03 percent, at 21,335.19. The index had hit an all-time high of 21,354.56 earlier in the session. The S&P; 500 was down 2.85 points, or 0.11 percent, at 2,437.5 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 3.37 points, or 0.05 percent, at 6,217.00. Gains in defensive sectors like consumer staples and utilities helped contain losses on the indexes. Johnson & Johnson rose 0.8 percent to $133.14 after the company's flu drug succeeded in a mid-stage trial. Alexion was up 8.4 percent at $117.23 after the biotechnology company named Biogen's Chief Financial Officer Paul Clancy as its CFO. Biogen's stock was down 3.4 percent. H&R; Block was the biggest percentage gainer on the S&P; 500, rising 9.3 percent to $29.50 after the tax preparation service provider's fourth-quarter revenue and profit beat analysts' expectations. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,563 to 1,330. On the Nasdaq, 1,604 issues fell and 1,169 advanced.

EU officials have piled pressure on VW to compensate European customers after it admitted to U.S. regulators in September 2015 that it had cheated on emissions tests there using software installed in as many as 11 million diesel vehicles sold worldwide - the majority of them in Europe. Despite VW's admission of wrongdoing in the United States, it says it has not broken the law in Europe and sees no need to compensate consumers there. VW's chief executive Matthias Mueller told the EU's commissioner for consumer affairs earlier this week that the company would now offer European customers a two-year extended warranty, the Commission spokesman said. However, commenting on the talks with the commissioner, Vera Jourova, Volkswagen did not confirm that it had agreed to extend its guarantee. The company instead referred back to earlier  confidence-building measures  including a commitment to fix all vehicles affected by this autumn, saying that updating the software would not detract from the car's performance.  Volkswagen has said all along that it cares for every customer,  it said in an email on Wednesday. An extended warranty offer would be the first concession made by the company in response to mounting pressure from Brussels to do more for its diesel customers following months of talks with EU officials and more than a year after the Dieselgate scandal broke. Jourova and other EU regulators have repeatedly expressed frustration over VW's attitude to European customers in not offering the cash payouts granted to U.S. owners of its cars. But the European Union is limited in what it can do to pressure the company since the power to police the car industry currently lies with member states, which approve new car models that are then sold throughout the bloc. Unlike the United States, a patchwork of different legal rules across the Europe Union also weakens the chances of car owners successfully suing carmakers.

Some property developers in the city bought land zoned for commercial use as a cheaper alternative to plots meant for homes. Apartment blocks put up on these sites were consequently cheaper, and weren't regulated under home-purchase rules brought in to curb speculation and soaring prices. The properties proved popular with investors and homebuyers shut out of the market by the buying restrictions. But Shanghai last month rolled out a  clean up and rectify  campaign for commercial-turned-residential developments, following similar moves in the capital, Beijing. While this may deter some speculation, it is likely also to further squeeze the mainstream housing market and push up prices.  These types of apartments were quite popular in the past few years because of home purchase restrictions,  said Clement Luk, CEO of East China at realtor Centaline.  Clients like those who haven't lived in Shanghai for the required amount of years or buy-for-investment purposes go for these apartments. But with the new measures, demand from both real users and investors will be wiped out all at once.  In Beijing, sales of these so-called serviced apartments nearly tripled last year to more than 4 million square meters (43 million square feet), according to data from E-House China R&D; Institute, accounting for a third of all residential sales, up from just 13 percent in 2015. But sales there collapsed in April, down more than 98 percent year-on-year, while unit prices fell 31 percent in May, the E-House data shows. The crackdown by Shanghai's housing authority - ordering developers and buyers to rip out fixtures such as toilets and kitchens before properties could be sold on - prompted a protest by hundreds of people last weekend after the market effectively froze. A similar protest is planned in Beijing this weekend. The Shanghai measures have already dented buyer sentiment for similar developments in other Chinese cities in anticipation of a broader nationwide clampdown, said Centaline's Luk. A general view shows residential buildings  in Beijing, July 15, 2016. Picture taken July 15, 2016.Thomas PeterDevelopers in Shanghai have suspended sales of all related developments, including Hong Kong developer Sun Hung Kai Properties' (0016.HK) luxury serviced apartment project on the Huangpu River in Pudong, property agents said.  Some cities over-planned their office supply; by converting some of this into apartments would have helped ease the glut,  said Stanley Ching, head of Citic Capital's real estate group.  But the new measures seem to contradict the policy intention to clear office inventory, and removing this extra supply of serviced apartments may further drive up home prices.  Still Unclear FILE PHOTO: A view of old houses surrounded by new apartment buildings in Guangfuli neighbourhood in Shanghai, China, April 8, 2016.Aly Song/File PhotoFollowing the protest, Shanghai's housing authority said buyers of commercial-turned-residential properties could take delivery of them if they had already signed purchase contracts, while developers were told to accommodate buyers seeking to cancel contracts. Some buy-and-hold investors, who want to rent out their apartments or live in them, welcomed this week's shift.  It's OK for those of us who are holding on to them for the long term,  said Ms. Ye, who said she was waiting to take delivery of a 50 square meter loft she bought two years ago that is still being built. Others, though, say they still don't know if they'll be allowed to re-sell these properties or if they'll be compensated if they cancel the purchase now. Developers and anyone looking to sell one of these properties soon are likely to be hit as they will be required first to restore residential apartments back to commercial use, and office space is worth up to a fifth less than apartments. Some funds, too, are now reviewing their investments.  (The measures) will have an impact on investment firms' strategy because many involve these developments, and the policy is likely to be introduced in other cities,  said Ching at Citic Capital.  We're stalling some deal talks until we have a clearer sense of the policy direction.  Greenland Holdings (600606.SS), whose Beijing unit was punished by local authorities last month for promoting apartments built on land designated for commercial use, said it has a few developments in Shanghai that fall into the  clean up  category, and it will adjust its marketing strategy accordingly.

Dana said on Tuesday it had received legal advice that its sukuk, or Islamic bonds, which mature in October, were not compliant with the Islamic sharia code and had become  unlawful  in the United Arab Emirates. The firm said it would halt payments and proposed that creditors exchange the sukuk for new Islamic instruments offering profit distributions less than half those of the existing sukuk. Worryingly for the Islamic finance industry, Dana said its sukuk were unlawful  due to the evolution and continual development of Islamic financial instruments and their interpretation . This has raised the prospect that other firms with Islamic debt could justify not honouring obligations by claiming sharia-based financial standards had changed since the debt was issued. It risks hurting a growing market. Issuance of longer-dated sukuk across core markets reached $40 billion in 2016, up from about $32 billion in 2015, Standard & Poor's said. In a conventional bond, the issuer pays bondholders interest and principal. Since interest is banned as  usury  in Islamic finance, sukuk holders are usually paid with returns from assets linked to the sukuk - in this case, Dana's gas assets. Dana has struggled to obtain payments from its production assets in Egypt and Iraq's Kurdistan. With a cash balance of just $298 million in March, it had been expected to have difficulty redeeming its sukuk in October. Nick Firoozye, a managing director at Nomura International in London, said Dana's case appeared to be the first time that a company under financial pressure had used uncertainty over sharia compliance in this way.  The possibility that companies could by whim choose to restructure un-compliant sukuk whenever there is some credit deterioration, based on their own newly strict interpretations, sets a terrible precedent,  he said. Mohammed Khnifer, a senior associate at Jeddah-based Islamic Development Bank, said:  This specific sharia compliance risk is unprecedented. This incident has startled our Islamic finance industry.  Some holders of the Dana sukuk contacted by Reuters said they hoped a committee of creditors would resist Dana's action, on the grounds that the sukuk were declared valid when issued four years ago. One person with knowledge of the case said the mudaraba structure which Dana used for its sukuk, while once common, had been superseded in the industry by other structures such as ijara, an Islamic form of leasing. Mudaraba is a type of investment management partnership.  Dana is keen to engage constructively with sukuk holders to reach a consensual agreement,  the person said. Shifting Interpretations One characteristic of Islamic finance is that there is a wide range of opinions about what is sharia-compliant among the scholars who design instruments and advise investors what is permissible to buy. For example, an instrument commonly accepted in Malaysia might be viewed with suspicion by Gulf Arab issuers and investors. And views can change over time: a common practice called commodity murabaha has been increasingly criticised by scholars in the last few years. Prices of other corporate sukuk in the Gulf did not appear to react to Dana's announcement. But Firoozye, a specialist in structured and fixed income products, said several sukuk might eventually trade based on the possibility that their sharia-compliance could be questioned.  Sharia risk leading to an excuse for write-downs means sharia risk is now truly toxic,  he said. Investors could demand higher yields from corporate sukuk to compensate for the risk, and structuring sukuk to limit risk may become more time-consuming and expensive. Khnifer said investors might seek peace of mind by obtaining multiple fatwas, or religious rulings, from several banks endorsing a single sukuk. Dana has applied to a UAE court to have its sukuk declared invalid. Resolving the case could take many months. The firm said the first UAE court hearing would be on Dec. 25 and in the meantime it had obtained an injunction blocking claims on it. A source with direct knowledge of its position said Dana would argue its existing sukuk were invalid since the repurchase price was fixed in advance, while coupon payments were decided with an interest-based calculation and paid regardless of the firm's performance. If those arguments where applied elsewhere, almost all other publicly issued sukuk would be deemed non-compliant, said Khalid Howladar, managing director of Dubai-based Acreditus Advisors. He saw some similarities to a legal dispute in 2009 between Kuwait's The Investment Dar (TID) and Lebanon's Blom Bank. TID argued in an English court that an Islamic financial contract into which it had entered was void because it was not sharia-compliant in the first place. The court set aside that argument and viewed the transaction on its contractual terms. That case may be relevant for Dana because Dana's sukuk are governed by English law, while the gas production assets behind the sukuk fall under UAE law, according to its prospectus.  It remains to be seen whether applying sharia non-compliance as a legitimate restructuring driver is successful in this case,  said Howladar.  In TID's case it was not, and the industry was spared an unpleasant trial.

The researchers focused on whatâs known as peptic ulcers, or painful sores lining the stomach or small intestine, which are often caused by bacterial infections but have also been linked to drinking, smoking and certain medications. Untreated bleeding ulcers can lead to bloody vomit or stool, anemia and life-threatening blood loss that requires hospitalization.  Researchers examined whether short-term spikes in air pollution could also influence the risk of serious bleeds, and estimated a 7.6 percent increased risk of emergency admissions for bleeding peptic ulcers during five-day periods with higher average nitrogen dioxide levels.  âWe already knew that air pollution exposure may alter intestinal immunity, increase gut permeability and influence intestinal microbial composition, which may contribute to the development of various intestinal diseases,â said senior study author Wai-Keung Leung of the University of Hong Kong.  âThis is the first time that the association between air pollution and peptic ulcer bleeding, one of the most important complications of peptic ulcer, is being reported,â Leung said by email.  For the study, researchers examined data on air pollution levels in Hong Kong and 8,566 emergency admissions for bleeding peptic ulcer in adults 65 and older from 2005 to 2010.  In addition to nitrogen dioxide, they also looked at concentrations of ozone, an unstable form of oxygen produced when various types of traffic and industrial pollution react with sunlight; sulfur dioxide, a byproduct of fossil fuel combustion and refining minerals like copper, aluminum and iron; and so-called PM 2.5, a mixture of solid particles and liquid droplets smaller than 2.5 micrometers in diameter that can include dust, dirt, soot and smoke. They also considered factors that can influence air quality like temperature, humidity and other weather conditions.  Out of all the air pollutants, only elevated nitrogen dioxide levels were independently associated with an increased risk of emergency admissions for bleeding peptic ulcer, the study team reports in The Lancet Planetary Health.  One limitation of the study is its use of air quality readings on the date of the emergency admission to examine the link between the pollutants and bleeding peptic ulcers because, the authors note, itâs possible some people might have developed symptoms triggered several days before they went to the hospital.  Researchers also didnât have data on other risk factors for bleeding peptic ulcer such as infections with H. pylori bacteria or regular use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) medications like aspirin and ibuprofen.  The results from Asian residents of Hong Kong also might differ from what would be found in other racial or ethnic groups because some people can have a genetic predisposition to this health problem. An earlier study in Canada with a mostly white population didnât find an association between nitrogen dioxide and bleeding peptic ulcer, the author of that study, Dr. Gilaad Kaplan of the University of Calgary, writes in an accompanying editorial.  However, residents of Hong Kong were exposed to much higher levels of nitrogen dioxide than people in the Canadian study, Kaplan notes in the editorial.  âAir pollution is a modifiable risk factor that is linked to diseases throughout the body from the respiratory system to the cardiovascular system, with growing evidence that it may influence the gastrointestinal tract,â Kaplan told Reuters Health by email.  âAs a modifiable risk factor, people who are at risk for the adverse health effects of air pollution can take action to protect themselves on days when air pollution levels spike locally by avoiding larger sources of pollution when reasonably possible (e.g. avoiding jogging near heavy traffic, working earlier in the day to avoid the worst of rush hour traffic),â Kaplan added. âMoreover, society needs to prioritize actions to continue to improve the air quality of cities.â SOURCE: bit.ly/2t1OiIZ and bit.ly/2rrdETq The Lancet Planetary Health, online May 5, 2017.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-ulcers-air-pollution-idUSKBN1952FP"},

Even though the Federal Reserve was almost certain to raise interest rates later in the day, disappointing retail sales and inflation numbers cast doubt on the speed of its monetary policy tightening. The STOXX 600  index fell 0.3 percent with the banks .SXEP, whose lending business gets a boost in margins when rates rise, taking off most points from the pan-European index with a fall of 1.3 percent. The oil sector .SXEP fell 1.6 percent to six-month lows as crude prices tumbled to a five-week low following data showing an unexpectedly large weekly build in U.S. gasoline inventories. Shares had earlier been supported by data showing that euro zone industrial output grew in April, and that employment rose in the first quarter of the year to reach a record high. Among outstanding movers, the Swedish measurement technology firm Hexagon (HEXAb.ST) rose 10.8 percent to a new record high after a Wall Street Journal report that it was in talks about a potential sale to undisclosed buyers. Hexagon said that the market would be immediately informed should evaluations lead to concrete results. Technology stocks .SX8P rose 0.4 percent, clawing back some ground after a nosedive fueled by jitters over valuations, particularly in the U.S..

Developed by Physicians for Human Rights (PHR), MediCapt allows clinicians to record medical examination results digitally and photograph victims' injuries, store them online and send them directly to law enforcement officials and lawyers. In a vast nation plagued by militant violence and poor roads that restrict access to remote areas, PHR hopes the mobile app will lead to more convictions for sexual violence and help Congo to shake off its tag as  rape capital of the world.  By recording data about both victims and assailants, the app - which is currently in field testing - could also be used to detect mass violence and crimes against humanity and provide evidence for war crimes investigators, according to PHR.  It has the power to be used as an early warning system or rapid response tool, as the data could show patterns of abuses and violence,  said Karen Naimer, director of the U.S.-based PHR's program on sexual violence in conflict zones.  MediCapt could help prosecutors map trends or patterns of locations attacked, victims targeted and languages spoken and the uniform worn by assailants, Naimer told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  The app may also be used to push for war crime prosecutions with evidence of crimes that are widespread or systematic,  she said. Ethnic violence in Congo, Africa's second-largest nation, has spread and worsened since December when President Joseph Kabila refused to step down at the end of his mandate. Recent acts of violence between local militia and Congolese forces in central Congo, including the killing of civilians and foreign U.N. experts, could constitute war crimes, the International Criminal Court's prosecutor said in April. Yet the priority for PHR with MediCapt - which will be rolled out for use by doctors in eastern Congo this summer - is to ensure that it gives victims of sexual violence the security and confidence to come forward and speak out, said Naimer. Sexual violence is often seen as a by-product of years of fighting in Congo, where atrocities were blamed on soldiers and armed groups, but rape is also rife beyond the conflict zones.  While the app has the potential to highlight mass violence and human rights violations, protecting victims of sexual violence has to come first,  Naimer said.

Expectations are growing for the Canadian plane-and-train-maker to announce new orders for its fuel-efficient 110-to-130 seat CSeries jets after it failed to secure any substantial orders in about a year. But even as some market observers look to showcase events like Paris, which are used to launch products and make order announcements, planemakers are bracing for softer sales in 2017 after a prolonged order boom.  I think it is a slow time period because there was this binge of orders in the last few years,  said the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the media.  Airlines are still trying to figure out their fleet plans.  Bombardier did not announce any orders for the CSeries jets at the Farnborough Airshow last year, but won key sales campaigns from Delta Air Lines (DAL.N) and Air Canada (AC.TO) in the months preceding the event. Lack of new orders could be one factor weighing on the stock which fell as much as 10 percent last Friday after the U.S International Trade Commission gave a green light to start an  anti-dumping probe against the CSeries for alleged unfair subsidies.  We are encouraged by the discussions we are having with our potential customers on all our platforms, but deals will be announced once they are signed,  Bombardier spokesman Bryan Tucker said. As of December 2016, the CSeries had recorded 360 firm orders and most capacity is sold out through 2020. Average list prices as of January, 2017 were $79.5 million for the 110-seat CS100 and $89.5 million for the 130-seat CS300, but airlines typically receive discounts of around 50 percent on aircraft. Bombardier has said it is comfortable with the company's existing CSeries sales, and head of commercial aviation Fred Cromer recently dismissed suggestions that Boeing Co (BA.N)'s anti-dumping complaint would slow orders. Cromer would not comment on the timing of orders, or expectations for Paris, which he said would serve to showcase new products. Bombardier, however, sees replacement opportunities inÂ the regional jet market âas aging planes are retired and operators shift from 50 seaters to larger regional aircraft, Tucker said.  Mesa Air Group, a Phoenix-based regional airline which operates jets by Bombardier and rival Embraer SA (EMBR3.SA), is considering the future of the CRJ-900s it ordered in the early 2000s.    We are looking at a number of fleet replacement strategies as the aircrafts are getting older,  said Mesa chief executive Jonathan Ornstein by phone last Thursday.

NRG, the largest independent U.S. power producer, appointed two directors in February and agreed to cut costs and sell assets in a deal with activist investors Elliott Management and Bluescape Energy Partners. The funds acquired a 9.4 percent stake in NRG early in 2017. Shares of NRG were down 2.9 percent at $16.44 in late morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange. The bankruptcy will transfer ownership of GenOn, which operates 32 power plants in eight states, to its senior noteholders. GenOn's plants, mostly in the Mid-Atlantic, have a total production capacity of approximately 15,394 megawatts. The company generates nearly two-thirds of its electricity from natural gas. Holders of notes issued by affiliate GenOn Americas Generation will receive in cash 92 percent of the principal of the $695 million outstanding, plus accrued interest. As part of the debt-cutting agreement, GenOn and NRG agreed to transition shared services to a third party and NRG will also pay a settlement of $261.3 million in cash to GenOn. NRG will also provide a $330 million letter of credit to GenOn.  NRG acquired GenOn in 2012 for $1.7 billion. Mauricio Gutierrez, the president and chief executive of NRG, said in an emailed statement that the bankruptcy will help simplify NRG while maintaining a strong balance sheet.         The senior noteholders will also receive the right to participate in an offering of $700 million of new notes to refinance the company when it emerges from Chapter 11.  Cheap natural gas flowing from shale fields has brought down electricity prices in recent years, squeezing margins for wholesale power generation companies.  Exelon Corp (EXC.N) has hired a debt restructuring adviser and said it plans to close its Three Mile Island nuclear power plant ahead of schedule. FirstEnergy Corp (FE.N) has said it plans to exit its merchant business by mid-2018. Energy Future Holdings Corp, the largest power generation company in Texas, filed for bankruptcy in 2014 and Panda Temple Power LLC filed earlier this year.

Some property developers in the city bought land zoned for commercial use as a cheaper alternative to plots meant for homes. Apartment blocks put up on these sites were consequently cheaper, and weren't regulated under home-purchase rules brought in to curb speculation and soaring prices. The properties proved popular with investors and homebuyers shut out of the market by the buying restrictions. But Shanghai last month rolled out a  clean up and rectify  campaign for commercial-turned-residential developments, following similar moves in the capital, Beijing. While this may deter some speculation, it is likely also to further squeeze the mainstream housing market and push up prices.  These types of apartments were quite popular in the past few years because of home purchase restrictions,  said Clement Luk, CEO of East China at realtor Centaline.  Clients like those who haven't lived in Shanghai for the required amount of years or buy-for-investment purposes go for these apartments. But with the new measures, demand from both real users and investors will be wiped out all at once.  In Beijing, sales of these so-called serviced apartments nearly tripled last year to more than 4 million square meters (43 million square feet), according to data from E-House China R&D; Institute, accounting for a third of all residential sales, up from just 13 percent in 2015. But sales there collapsed in April, down more than 98 percent year-on-year, while unit prices fell 31 percent in May, the E-House data shows. The crackdown by Shanghai's housing authority - ordering developers and buyers to rip out fixtures such as toilets and kitchens before properties could be sold on - prompted a protest by hundreds of people last weekend after the market effectively froze. A similar protest is planned in Beijing this weekend. The Shanghai measures have already dented buyer sentiment for similar developments in other Chinese cities in anticipation of a broader nationwide clampdown, said Centaline's Luk. A general view shows residential buildings  in Beijing, July 15, 2016. Picture taken July 15, 2016.Thomas PeterDevelopers in Shanghai have suspended sales of all related developments, including Hong Kong developer Sun Hung Kai Properties' (0016.HK) luxury serviced apartment project on the Huangpu River in Pudong, property agents said.  Some cities over-planned their office supply; by converting some of this into apartments would have helped ease the glut,  said Stanley Ching, head of Citic Capital's real estate group.  But the new measures seem to contradict the policy intention to clear office inventory, and removing this extra supply of serviced apartments may further drive up home prices.  Still Unclear FILE PHOTO: A view of old houses surrounded by new apartment buildings in Guangfuli neighbourhood in Shanghai, China, April 8, 2016.Aly Song/File PhotoFollowing the protest, Shanghai's housing authority said buyers of commercial-turned-residential properties could take delivery of them if they had already signed purchase contracts, while developers were told to accommodate buyers seeking to cancel contracts. Some buy-and-hold investors, who want to rent out their apartments or live in them, welcomed this week's shift.  It's OK for those of us who are holding on to them for the long term,  said Ms. Ye, who said she was waiting to take delivery of a 50 square meter loft she bought two years ago that is still being built. Others, though, say they still don't know if they'll be allowed to re-sell these properties or if they'll be compensated if they cancel the purchase now. Developers and anyone looking to sell one of these properties soon are likely to be hit as they will be required first to restore residential apartments back to commercial use, and office space is worth up to a fifth less than apartments. Some funds, too, are now reviewing their investments.  (The measures) will have an impact on investment firms' strategy because many involve these developments, and the policy is likely to be introduced in other cities,  said Ching at Citic Capital.  We're stalling some deal talks until we have a clearer sense of the policy direction.  Greenland Holdings (600606.SS), whose Beijing unit was punished by local authorities last month for promoting apartments built on land designated for commercial use, said it has a few developments in Shanghai that fall into the  clean up  category, and it will adjust its marketing strategy accordingly.

Fabiana Valencise Olmedo said the 823-million reais ($250 million) bid presented by RaÃ­zen, a joint venture between Cosan SA Industria e Comercio and Royal Dutch Shell , was almost double the size of the only other offer. The producers group is a strategic creditor of Tonon, owner of three sugar and ethanol plants in Brazil, which is under bankruptcy protection. According to the restructuring plan approved by creditors in April, it will sell two of those mills to pay banks, bond holders and other creditors. The auction is scheduled for Friday morning, in JaÃº, Sao Paulo state. But Olmedo told Reuters that lawyers already had access to the only two proposals presented by the June 13 deadline, and RaÃ­zen's bid was larger by far.  The auction is likely to be just a formality now, unless some other judicial decision comes in the way,  she said. The other bid was presented by Suem do Brasil, a local company which packages and export sugar. Suem offered 434 million reais for the two mills. RaÃ­zen said on Tuesday, in a securities filing, that it had presented the proposal for the Tonon assets. It said the conclusion of a deal, in the event it wins the auction, hinges on unspecified conditions. RaÃ­zen owns 24 sugar and ethanol mills in Brazil. Three are in the region where the two Tonon plants on sale are located, a detail valued by sugar groups as they seek to concentrate operations in clusters to reduce cane transportation costs. The two Tonon mills, named Santa CÃ¢ndida and ParaÃ­so, have a combined annual cane crushing capacity of 5.7 million tonnes. Tonon aims to retain its third mill, in the neighboring Mato Grosso do Sul state.

The new Nokia products promise to help it win business with so-called  web-scale  customers such as Facebook, Google and Amazon â for whom transmission speed is everything and who are still increasing spending on network gear, unlike its traditional base of telecoms customers. The new products grew out of Nokia's 15.6 billion-euro ($17.5 billion) 2016 acquisition of Alcatel and its IP network gear business. The new traffic routers can handle the greater demands of virtual reality programming, cloud-based internet services and next-generation mobile communications, the company said. They will also serve Nokia's existing base of telecom operator customers who want speed but still must contend with legacy gear needed to run existing services, as they are backward compatible with older products.  With this announcement, Nokia will have the highest-performance system capacity in the market, and a lot of those web-scalers, they just want speed,  Ray Mota, principal analyst, ACG Research, said in an interview with Reuters.  That gives them an opportunity to approach the core network market with more credibility and gain some traction there.  The Finnish company is introducing its latest FP4 silicon chipset capable of processing data at 2.4 terabits per second. These will be built into a new portfolio of routers to operate both ultra high-speed  core  networks at the heart of the biggest internet services and also  edge  networks that link datacenters to front-line customer services running on mobile or fixed-line networks. The new products are scheduled to ship in the fourth quarter of this year, Nokia said. The former Alcatel IP networks business is already the world's No. 2 player in edge routers behind Cisco, having displaced Juniper Networks, which is now No. 3. The Nokia business also competes with China's Huawei in router markets outside the United States - where Huawei is barred for national security reasons - including Asia, Europe and Latin America. Nokia is facing flat capital spending among its telecom customer base, leading it to pursue more business from web-scale players, which have doubled their capital spending on network equipment over the past four years, Mota said. Nokia is introducing the 7950 petabit-class router aimed at the core routing market to help it win new customers such as Facebook and Google. A petabit is capable of transmitting 5,000 two-hour-long high-definition videos every second. For edge network customers, Nokia is introducing its 7750 router, offering the highest traffic capacity on the market. Mota said the Nokia 7750 can deliver speeds of up to 4.8 terabits per slot, compared with Juniper's 3 terabit edge router speeds, which had been the industry's fastest. A terabit can transfer a high-definition Netflix TV episode in one second. Beyond sheer speed, there is enough processing power head-room in its new chipset to offer built-in security features to fend off the growing threat of distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks that are now a fact of life for organisations running on the internet. $1 = 0.8916 euros Additional reporting by Jussi Rosendahl in Helsinki; Editing by Ken Ferris","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/nokia-routers-idUSL8N1JB08C"},

Until 10 p.m. London time last Thursday, Prime Minister Theresa May's decision to call the snap poll did not look like a pivotal point for the most-sold major currency of last year.  Sterling lost almost a fifth of its value between June 2016, when Britons voted to leave the European Union, and November. Many had begun to assume that would be the full extent of the  Brexit discount  demanded by overseas investors to keep faith with the world's fifth-largest economy.  But May's loss of her majority drove a 2 percent fall in the pound on Friday and another 1 percent on Monday, and traders now say the election could prove another turning point for sterling.  After the biggest-ever move in favor of the pound in the four weeks to mid-May, market positioning has reversed.     For many strategists, the election result not only makes the likely shape of Brexit even more uncertain, it also creates a political hiatus that risks the sort of sudden stop to economic activity that many feared would follow last year's referendum.   Markets are still trying to work out what the new risk premium is for sterling,  says James Binny, head of currencies at U.S. financial group State Street Global Advisors in London.   If the Conservatives back a softer Brexit, sterling would seem to want to go up. But if it became much clearer that things were heading downhill from a growth perspective, then that might create a bigger move down.   Vicious Cycle  Markets now assume May's failure to secure her party a majority will lead to a softening of the government's Brexit stance to give greater priority to a close trading relationship with the EU.  But there's little confidence that the planned loose support agreement with Northern Irish Unionists can keep her minority Conservative government afloat for long, or whether May herself can cling on as premier for the two years of divorce talks.  Anxiety that Britain's economy may be entering a downward spiral was already growing before the election.  Sterling's weakness in the wake of the Brexit vote has driven inflation above the Bank of England's target at a time when household wages and overall growth are not keeping pace, as data on Wednesday underlined.  FILE PHOTO: A general view shows the Bank of England in the City of London, Britain April 19, 2017.Hannah McKay/File PhotoBut high and increasingly static housing costs that eat into the pay packets of young Britons without feeding optimism among their older neighbors mean the Bank of England is forced to ignore rising prices and keep credit conditions ultra-loose.  The combination of high inflation and cheap money then just undermines the pound further.  That presents a stark contrast with the euro zone, now on its best economic run for a decade, and leaves sterling looking most exposed against the euro.  Some airport exchange bureaus are already offering holidaymakers less than a euro per pound and the options markets companies use to insure against currency moves have flipped from positive on sterling in mid-April to universally negative. EURGBPVOL=   The fundamentals still are not positive, they are negative,  said Josh O'Byrne, a currency strategist with Citi, the world's single biggest currency trader, in London.   We have this cyclical underperformance. We have this political divergence where the UK is looking less stable, Europe looks more so.   And also the positioning does not favor sterling. People are taking another look but waiting for more clarity.   Barclays, which was positive on the pound before last week, has put its forecasts on review and is likely to cut them.   The uncertainty that the (election) result brings means that you have a degree of the risk premia re-establishing itself,  said Barclays strategist Hamish Pepper.  The currency is vulnerable to that in the near term.   Much will depend on how fiscal and monetary policies mesh over the next year, and some hedge funds and other major speculative investors are already wondering if more quantitative easing (QE) asset purchases from the BoE will be in the mix.  That would further loosen monetary policy and probably prove negative for sterling, although it would provide a backstop bid for British government bonds, known as gilts.  Ed Al-Hussainy, senior interest rate and currency analyst at Columbia Threadneedle, which manages $467 billion of assets, said ordinarily investors would sell gilts and demand higher interest rates to hold them, pressuring public finances.   But here's the twist: we have an opportunity for the Bank to restart QE,  he said.  The threshold for that is still very high -- we need to see a much greater deterioration.   But in that scenario it is not clear that rates will go up.   Editing by Catherine Evans","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-markets-sterling-analysis-idUSKBN19528B"},

She was 92.  She took over the helm of the Clarin newspaper in 1969 after the death of her husband Roberto Noble, the paper's founder. At the time of her death, she was one of four controlling shareholders of Grupo Clarin, Argentina's largest media conglomerate.   Under Herrera de Noble's leadership, Clarin acquired radio stations and television channels on its way to becoming the South American country's largest media group.  Late in her tenure, Grupo Clarin, which is listed on the Buenos Aires bourse, became locked in a dispute with former Argentine President Cristina Fernandez after its news outlets criticized the populist leader's handling of a 2008 uprising by farmers.  Fernandez encouraged an investigation into the identity of Herrera de Noble's two adopted children, who human rights groups long suspected were stolen as babies from murdered political prisoners during Argentina's military dictatorship from 1976 to 1983.  The 10-year battle with activists came to an end in 2011 when tests showed the two children's DNA did not match samples from 55 families seeking to identify missing relatives. Up to 30,000 people were kidnapped and killed during the so-called Dirty War in a crackdown on leftist dissent, according to rights groups. Criticized for having too much political influence and market share, Grupo Clarin was nearly forced to break up under a Fernandez-backed anti-monopoly law. Clarin has a 41 percent share of the Buenos Aires area newspaper market, according to a recent securities filing.  They will not get us to stop doing journalism,  Herrera de Noble said at a 2010 speech, according to an obituary published on Wednesday on Clarin's website.

A fall of 0.4 percent in wage growth in the three months to April, when adjusted for inflation, represented the biggest loss of real earnings for households since 2014, even as a joint record high proportion of people in Britain are in work. Britain's economy withstood the shock of last year's Brexit in 2016, prompting some supporters of Brexit to say fears of a hit to the economy were overblown. But growth slowed sharply in early 2017 as consumers felt the pinch of rising inflation caused by the fall in the value of the pound after the referendum. Credit card firm Visa said on Monday it saw the first annual fall in spending by consumers in nearly four years in May.     Other rich countries around the world are also struggling with the phenomenon of low unemployment but weak wages. But the challenge looks particularly acute for May and her minority government, which is still putting together a deal with a small Northern Irish party that will give her enough votes in parliament to pass legislation. The opposition Labor Party won many more votes than expected in last week's election with its promises of measures such as the end to a 1-percent cap on pay increases for public sector workers and a higher minimum wage.  Public sector workers have not had a proper pay rise since 2011,  Dave Prentis, head of UNISON, a union which represents the sector, said.  The public sector pay cap must go.  Finance minister Philip Hammond is due to deliver his first speech since the election on Thursday. Sterling Falls Ratings agency Moody's has said the government might now slow Britain's push to lower the budget deficit, having already pushed back the target date for a surplus to the mid-2020s. A municipal worker sweeps the street outside the cabinet office in Westminster, central London, Britain, June 9, 2017.Clodagh KilcoyneHammond's predecessor as finance minister, George Osborne,  said on Tuesday that the government's problems would  get a whole lot worse if it ditches fiscal responsibility.  Wednesday's data showing the worsening hit to earnings is likely to add to the view among the majority of Bank of England officials to leave interest rates on hold when they announce their latest policy statement on Thursday. The BoE has so far seen no sign that inflation is pushing up wages which would create longer-lasting pressure on prices. It expects wages to rise by 2 percent this year and pick up in 2018 and 2019, something many economists now say looks optimistic. The central bank is widely expected to keep interest rates at their record low of 0.25 percent on Thursday. Sterling hit a day's low against the dollar after the data, while British government bond prices rallied, suggesting investors took the figures as a sign that interest rates would not be rising any time soon. The weakness in pay has puzzled economists given the apparent strength of Britain's labor market. The Office for National Statistics said the unemployment rate in the period between February and April held steady at a more than four-decade low of 4.6 percent. The number of people in work increased by 109,000 in the three months to April, taking the employment rate to 74.8 percent, a joint record high, the ONS said. But economists focused on the weak wage data. In nominal terms, wages grew at the slowest pace since February 2016, rising an annual 2.1 percent in the three months to April and slowing from 2.3 percent in the first quarter. Economists taking part in a Reuters poll had expected wage growth of 2.4 percent. Samuel Tombs, an economist at consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the wage numbers appeared consistent with signs of rising underemployment.  The wage figures are astonishingly weak,  he said.

Dissident shareholders together holding an almost 40 percent stake have backed nominees to replace four out of six directors at Petropavlovsk, including Hambro. In an initial report, shareholder advisor ISS advised against supporting any of the dissident proposals, but on Wednesday it issued revised recommendations, saying it had received additional information.  While the dissidents have not provided a detailed strategy and transition plan, we recognise that they have made a compelling case that change at the board level is warranted,  it said, recommending a vote against Hambro's re-election. Hambro, who agreed earlier this year to stand down as chairman and instead be an executive director, told Reuters the allegations of inadequate governance were  very subjective  and he would continue talking to the shareholders and ISS.  We believe that we have good corporate governance,  he said. ISS recommended backing two of the dissidents' nominees. They are Garrett Soden, who has worked for the Lundin group of companies for a decade, and Ian Ashby, nominated to be chairman. Ashby headed BHP's  iron ore division from 2006 to 2012 and was named in May as a non-executive director at Anglo American, which has declined to comment. ISS recommended rejecting two other nominees - Bruce Buck, who is chairman of Chelsea Football Club, and Vladislav Egorov, who works for Renova, Russian billionaire Viktor Vekselberg's conglomerate. Chelsea Football Club has declined to comment, as has Renova -- Petropavlovk's biggest shareholder with 14.6 percent. Other shareholders DE Shaw, M&G; and Sothic, which together hold 25 percent, said in a statement on Wednesday they had no intention of taking control of the company and were not acting with Renova.  Petropavlovsk needs a board with strong, independent directors who can support and constructively challenge management on operational, financial and strategic issues in order to return value to shareholders,  they said. It added M&G; had submitted at least 10 independent candidates to Petropavlovsk's nomination committee since 2015, but all had been dismissed. In the years before a restructuring in 2015, Petropavlovsk's equity value collapsed. The share price has recovered from lows around 2 pence at the end of 2014 to just over 8 pence, boosted by a return to profit in 2016, but the dissidents say it is still underperforming its peers.

The drug, designed to be injected at the site of pain, is being developed by the privately-held company run by former Pfizer Inc chief executive Jeffrey Kindler. Centrexion's drug, a man-made version of chili plant extract trans-capsaicin, is designed to work by inactivating local pain fibers transmitting signals to the brain.  The mid-stage trial tested two doses of the drug, CNTX-4975, against a placebo in 175 difficult-to-treat knee osteoarthritis patients who had failed or were unable to tolerate prior pain therapy. Osteoarthritis affects about 14 million Americans. It is   caused by the progressive breakdown and eventual loss of cartilage, and characterized by pain, swelling and decreased mobility of the affected joint.  Data showed the drug induced statistically significant pain relief as well as reduced knee stiffness and improved physical function at 24 weeks after a single injection. Patients on the 1 milligram (mg) dose experienced a reduction of 3.8 on a scale measuring daily pain with walking, versus a decline of 2.4 for those on the placebo, the company said on Tuesday. With exploding U.S. rates of abuse, overdose and addiction to opioids - a lethal family of drugs widely prescribed for pain - as well as side-effects seen with other pain treatments, developing an analgesic with little side-effects has become imperative.  The safety profile of CNTX-4975 was comparable to that of a placebo, chief medical officer Randall Stevens said, adding that the medicine is cleared out of the body 24 hours after it is injected.  When you eat a hot chili meal, you're consuming about 25 mg of capsaicin. So the systemic exposure from the meal is actually higher,  he told Reuters.  The Boston-based company, which is developing various non-opioid painkillers, expects to initiate a late-stage study later this year for CNTX-4975.

They said the (High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems -  HIMARS - had moved into the desert garrison, which has seen a buildup in recent weeks as tensions escalate after the U.S.-led coalition struck Iranian-backed forces to prevent them advancing toward the Tanf base.  They have arrived now in Tanf and they are a significant boost to the U.S. military presence there,  one senior intelligence source said, without elaborating. The HIMARS had already been deployed in northern Syria with U.S.-backed forces battling Islamic State militants, he added.  Washington deployed the HIMARS on the Turkish border to strike at Islamic State outposts. They were used several times from the Jordanian border to hit militants who had a foothold in the southeastern desert.  Under heavy pressure, the militants have mostly retreated from the desert in the last three months. Now U.S.-backed Syrian rebels are competing with the Syrian army and Iranian-backed militias as they all try to recapture territory from Islamic State.  Tanf is near a Syria-Iraq border crossing on the main Baghdad-Damascus highway. The rebels took it from Islamic State last year, partly to stop Iran from using it to send arms to the Syrian government.  The rebels also want to use it to take more territory along the border and to push toward Deir al-Zor, a large city on the Euphrates where the government has an enclave surrounded by Islamic State fighters.

Desert locusts, found mainly in the Sahara, across the Arabian Peninsula and in India, pose a major threat to agricultural production when migrating in swarms, the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) says. A one kilometer-square swarm of about 40 million locusts can eat the same amount of food as 35,000 people in a day, according to the agency. FAO and ESA said they have developed a new remote sensing system that by processing satellite data on soil moisture and vegetation can predict the formation of swarms up to three months in advance.  Longer warning periods give countries more time to act swiftly to control a potential outbreak and prevent massive food losses,  said Keith Cressman, FAO's senior locust forecasting officer. The tool is the latest in a series to apply satellite data to agricultural purposes. For pest prevention teams, it is key to find locust breeding areas early in order to apply pesticides before grasshoppers grow wings and start migrating, Cressman said.  Then you are chasing a moving target,  he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Locusts breed in large numbers when good rains and rapid vegetation growth follow a period of drought.  Soil moisture data helps authorities locate areas where the ground is wet enough for the locusts to lay eggs and to monitor them for signs of swarming. Trials on data from a locust invasion in Mauritania in 2016 allowed ESA and FAO experts to identify hatching areas 70 days before the outbreak occurred. That significantly improved upon current forecast systems based on satellite information of green vegetation that give a maximum notice of one month and sometimes give authorities just a few days to reach remote breeding locations, Cressman said.   Often they are too late,  he said. Up to 100 percent of cereals and 90 percent of legumes were destroyed in West Africa in a 2003-2005 plague that affected eight million people and took 13 million liters of pesticide to be reined in, the FAO said.

Suncor Energy said late on Tuesday that Syncrude will not return to full rates until mid-July after maintenance scheduled to take place in the autumn of 2017 was added on to an ongoing turnaround. The plant, which can produce up to 350,000 barrels per day of synthetic crude at full capacity, is instead shipping 130,000 bpd to customers, Suncor said. Those volumes are expected to ramp up as maintenance on various units wraps up. Light synthetic crude from the oil sands for July delivery climbed to last trade at 75 cents per barrel over the West Texas Intermediate benchmark, according to Shorcan Energy brokers, having settled at 65 cents per barrel over WTI on Tuesday. Syncrude has been operating below capacity since March when a fire damaged the facility and forced Suncor to bring forward planned maintenance. The blaze started after a split in a carbon steel line in a naphtha hydrotreater, and most of the damage was to a piperack next to the hydrotreater containing piping, cables and electrical circuits. Suncor said there is no change to its overall 2017 production guidance as a result of the extended maintenance. The company's shares were last down 3.1 percent at C$39.61 on the Toronto Stock Exchange.  We view the update as being negative as the outage has once again shown to be larger than expected,  AltaCorp Capital analyst Nick Lupick wrote in a note to clients. The volume cuts have helped prop up the price of synthetic crude, and also tightened supply of heavy crude, because some oil sands producers need synthetic barrels from Syncrude to blend with their bitumen so it can flow through pipelines. Western Canada Select heavy blend crude for July delivery last traded at $10.45 per barrel below WTI, little changed from Tuesday's settle of $10.50 per barrel under the benchmark.

Britain's blue chip FTSE 100 index fell 0.35 percent, while the mid caps managed to end in positive territory, up 0.58 percent. Housebuilders had suffered a selloff in the immediate aftermath of the UK's general election, which resulted in a hung parliament, but a trading update from Bellway eased investors' concerns as the firm said demand had not slowed in the run-up to the election.  Housebuilders generally ... have been marked down because of fears over the UK economy, the UK property market, but actually the numbers that are coming out of these companies are still pretty reassuring,  said Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.  There are a number of tailwinds that (the housebuilders) also have, one of which is extremely low interest rates, another of which is the chronic lack of housing in this country, and a third thing is the government help-to-buy scheme,  Khalaf added. Bellway's shares rose 5.9 percent to a record high, while blue chip peers Barratt Developments, Persimmon and Taylor Wimpey were among the top FTSE gainers, up between 1.3 percent to 3.2 percent. But a fall in crude oil prices, following reports showing that U.S. crude inventories were still increasing, weighed on energy stocks, which took most points off the FTSE. Shares in BP and Royal Dutch Shell fell 1.8 and 1.3 percent respectively. Miners were also lower, with Anglo American and Glencore both down more than 2.5 percent. Mid-cap Acacia Mining bucked the weaker trend, up 7.9 percent, rallying after news that the gold miner and Tanzania had agreed to talks to try to settle a festering dispute over taxes, royalties and exports. British large-caps had earlier benefited after sterling weakened following UK data showing that earnings after inflation had contracted at the fastest pace since 2014, highlighting the growing post-Brexit strain on households. But the pound later reversed losses following a weak set of economic data in the U.S. Among individual stock movers, budget airline easyJet rose 1.5 percent after Davy Research upgraded the stock to  neutral  from  underperform , citing its higher operating leverage in the current environment.  We believe that the European low-cost carriers will continue to see improving pricing trends as we approach peak summer, albeit a consensus among the airlines has yet to form on whether pricing will be positive or negative,  analysts at Davy said in a note. Among the fallers were banks Lloyds and Standard Chartered, while equipment hire firm Ashtead dropped 1.4 percent, extending losses from the previous session after its earnings update.  Strong results, but no consensus upgrades, saw a muted investor reaction and we see more downside from here,  analysts at UBS said, adding that accelerating competition and slowing end markets this summer could leave Ashtead's valuation exposed. Likewise, shares in engineering group GKN also came under pressure after Panmure cut its rating to  sell  from  hold , on the back of challenges in the U.S. auto and Middle East aircraft markets.

U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan said  blanket suppression  was necessary because  sweeping  January 2012 searches of Wey's Manhattan apartment and the offices of his consulting firm, New York Global Group, violated his Fourth Amendment constitutional right against illegal searches and seizures. In a 92-page decision on Tuesday night, the Manhattan judge said prosecutors failed to show they needed broad warrants because they had probable cause to believe Wey's entire business was a scam. Items seized included children's school records, divorce records, family photos, medical records, prescription documents, recreational schedules, resumes and X-rays, the judge said.  This conduct reflects, at least, grossly negligent or reckless disregard of the strictures of the Fourth Amendment,  Nathan wrote. A spokeswoman for Acting U.S. Attorney Joon Kim in Manhattan declined to comment. Wey's lawyer David Siegal said  it's hard to imagine what other evidence won't be tainted  in the case, given how the searches were conducted early in the probe.  We're preparing for trial, and the government has some hard decisions to make,  he said. A trial is scheduled for Oct. 2. In reverse mergers, Chinese companies buy U.S.  shell  companies and assume their stock tickers. This lets them raise money without regulatory reviews typical for newly public companies. Dozens of reverse mergers occurred nearly a decade ago, but many soured amid questions about accounting and disclosures. Wey was charged in September 2015 with eight criminal counts including securities fraud, wire fraud and money laundering. Prosecutors said he secretly controlled large blocks of shares in shell companies that went through reverse mergers, leaving him with big stakes in Nasdaq-listed CleanTech Innovations Inc, Deer Consumer Products Inc and SmartHeat Inc. Wey then manipulated the companies' stock prices, and sold shares at artificially high levels, prosecutors said. The defendant pleaded not guilty, and according to his firm's website  never settles false claims.  Nathan had in January refused to dismiss the indictment. Also charged was Wey's Switzerland-based banker Seref Dogan Erbek, who remains at large. Wey was also in the news in June 2015, when a federal jury ordered him to pay $18 million to a former employee in a sexual harassment case. The award was later cut to $5.65 million. Wey appealed, and has denied wrongdoing. The case is U.S. v.

Fernandez,Luke Oliver,Nicholas Yeo,Qi Wang,MSCI Emerging Markets,US,MSCI,INDEXES,CHINA,Investment Banking and Investment Services (TRBC),Previews,Asia / Pacific,Funds,Equities Markets,China (PRC),Emerging Market Countries,Corporate Events,Investment Management and Fund Operators (TRBC)","sector":"Markets","content":"NEW YORK/HONG KONG (Reuters) - U.S. index provider MSCI will likely open up its Emerging Markets Index .MSCIEF next week to the so-called A shares that make up the majority of China's stock market after previously rejecting them on three occasions, investors and analysts said. The company has been in discussions with Chinese regulators and global investors for nearly four years over whether to add yuan-denominated shares listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen to the benchmark â tracked by around $1.6 trillion in assets â but has so far left them out because of concerns over restricted access to Chinaâs equity markets. China has yet to fix all the problems that make it tough for managers to get money in and of the countryâs stocks, but investors said the likelihood of inclusion dramatically increased after MSCI this year relaxed its criteria.  We detect a marked change in MSCI's accommodation this year,  Nick Yeo, head of Chinese and Hong Kong equities at Aberdeen Asset Management, said in an email. âThe index creator has modified its own admission criteria to such a degree that Chinaâs entry now appears a formality.  In March, MSCI proposed reducing the weighting of Chinese shares for potential inclusion, cutting the number of stocks to 169 from 448 in a bid to address curbs on repatriating capital from China and concerns over the countryâs high number of suspended stocks. The revised proposal helps address these issues because the 169 stocks can be easily accessed by foreigners through a trading link between the Hong Kong and Chinese exchanges  launched in 2014 and significantly expanded in December.  If included, A shares will initially make up just 0.5 percent of the MSCI Emerging Markets Index, but they will be diversified with a focus on high quality large-cap stocks that have a low track record of trading halts. The plan would also cut the weighting of financials and increase that of sectors like consumer discretionary, consumer staples and real estate.  This does provide a better balance of stocksÂ at the sector level,  said David MacKenzie, head of Asian equity management at Schroders.  The move toward a larger cap focus does hopefully take care of the issues with share suspensions.â Capital Controls Still, China has some way to go to fully open up its market.  Chinese regulators have been working in recent years to meet MSCI's demands that they free up repatriation of foreign capital, reduce the number and length of share suspensions and loosen other rules. But the country's reform agenda has stalled lately as the authorities have battled to prop up the flagging yuan through capital controls. MSCI Chief Executive Henry Fernandez told Reuters in January that capital controls were a concern, but according to one individual briefed on the matter in April the index provider was still eager to take the first inclusion steps. A spokesman for MSCI declined to comment on Wednesday. The China Securities Regulatory Commission, the country's markets regulator, and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, which controls China's capital account, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Although such a small initial weighting mostly represents a symbolic victory for China, over time its companies could make up as much as 40 percent of the total index drawing at least $272 billion into Chinaâs equity market, said Luke Oliver, managing director and head of ETF capital markets at Deutsche Asset Management. Qi Wang, a former MSCI executive director and current chief executive for asset manager MegaTrust Investments, said in a release that he anticipates capital flows could be even greater, bringing $640 billion to the A-share market.

U.S. retail sales in May recorded their biggest drop in 16 months and consumer prices unexpectedly fell, according to data released hours before the U.S. Federal Reserve published its rate-setting decision.     Traders widely expect the U.S. central bank to hike rates by a notch on Wednesday, but a mixed batch of economic figures has cast a shadow on expectations of at least two additional hikes.     A slower pace of tightening could sustain demand for emerging market assets, which tend to lure foreign investors with the promise of higher yields.     The Brazilian real strengthened 1 percent, the biggest gainer in the region, while the Mexican peso firmed 0.7 percent.     Brazil's benchmark Bovespa stock index inched up 0.3 percent, supported by rising shares of Banco Bradesco SA  after a federal court cleared the lender's chief executive offices of illegally dodging a tax fine.     Strategists at ItaÃº BBA on Wednesday cut their recommendation for Brazilian stocks to  underweight  from  neutral,  saying heightened uncertainty over the fate of a proposed pension reform is likely to lead to higher funding costs and a weaker currency.     Strategists upgraded their recommendation on Mexican shares to  overweight  on forecasts of stronger earnings growth, but warned of potential volatility around the 2018 presidential elections and coming NAFTA negotiations.

Stocks ended lower as mobile phone operator MTN slid to a four-month low. At 1530 GMT, the rand traded 1.25 percent higher at 12.6000 per dollar, after closing at 12.7600 overnight in New York, bringing weekly gains to around 2.5 percent. The unexpected decline in monthly U.S. consumer prices and retail sales suggested inflation pressures are moderating, which may delay interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve. The prospect of slower-than-expected U.S. rate increases boosts demand for emerging-market assets, which offer higher returns but carry more risk. The Fed is scheduled to announce its latest rate decision at 2 p.m. eastern time (1800 GMT) on Wednesday. The rand held on to gains despite continued fallout triggered by credit ratings downgrades. A survey showed on Wednesday that South African business confidence fell deeper into negative territory in the second quarter, to a level not seen since the 2009 recession, as business activity remained week and political risk persisted .  This sets the economy up for another year of negative growth in gross domestic fixed investment, which will serve as another blow to policymakers' hope to boost the countryâs falling potential growth rate,  said Jeffrey Schultz, an economist at BNP Paribas Securities South Africa. Government bonds also gained, with the yield for the benchmark instrument due in 2026 dropping 3.5 basis points to 8.405 percent. On the stock market, the benchmark Top-40 index was down 0.4 percent at 45,085 points. The broader All-share index was down 0.3 percent at 51,489 points. Shares in MTNw were down 2 percent to 111.60 rand, their lowest in four months. MTN counts crude-oil producers Nigeria and Iran among its three largest markets, and oil price fell after reports showed global supply was growing. Diversified mining companies Anglo American and BHP Billiton were the biggest losers among the blue chips, as copper prices fell before the Fed's decision. Anglo shares were down 2.9 percent to 171.71 rand and BHP slid 2.2 percent to 191.04 rand. Gold mining companies were among the gainers as the bullion price rose 1 percent after the U.S. inflation data. The JSE's gold index was up 1 percent at 1,337.40 points.

Lead underwriter Deutsche Bank is seeking commitments on the debt, which will fund the companyâs acquisition by Platinum Equity, by June 15. In addition to the US$150m five-year first-out revolver, the financing consists of an US$870m seven-year first-lien term loan and a US$280m eight-year second-lien term loan. Price talk on the first-lien term loan opened at 375bp-400bp over Libor with a 1% Libor floor and a 99.5 original issue discount. The second-lien term loan is guided at 800bp-825bp over Libor with a 1% Libor floor and a 99 offering price. The bank has been in discussions around the structure, as several potential first-lien lenders have submitted orders subject to a revised revolver, or higher pricing if the deal remains as proposed. The second-lien was pre-marketed and is oversubscribed, having been placed in part with some of Platinumâs relationship accounts, said a source. âSecurus has a super senior revolverâ¦worse than an ABL,â a source said. The pushback is partly technical, given the existing lender base comprises a number of Collateralized Loan Obligations (CLO) that have limitations on the amount of junior lien debt they can own. âThose constraints feed into market capacity,â a source said. âThe question is whether there are enough new buyers where it matters.â Buyout financings are commonly packaged with pari passu revolvers, putting the loans on equal footing with other first-lien debt in terms of claims on collateral. However, deals for certain industries, such as retail, are structured with asset-based loan (ABL) revolvers, which offer a first priority claim on working capital including accounts receivable and inventory. While institutional investors are generally averse to financings with ABL revolvers because they subordinate their claims on a companyâs most valuable assets, their loans still provide for a first-lien on collateral that does not secure the revolver. But first-out facilities have a first priority claim on overall collateral, meaning in cases like Securus, first-lien lenders effectively have a second priority and second-lien lenders are left with a third priority. Whether the banks or the sponsor pushed for the structure, it makes a statement about those partiesâ perception of the dealâs credit risk. The revolver will be drawn by US$20m at the close of the transaction. The revolver is rated BB/B1 by Standard & Poorâs and Moodyâs, respectively. The first- and second-lien tranches are rated B/B2 and CCC+/Caa2. The issuer is rated B/B3. Regulatory Cloud Securus is touting pro forma adjusted Ebitda of US$191m for the trailing 12 months ending March 31, which includes US$10m of synergies, for leverage at roughly 4.7 times through the first-lien debt and 6.0 times total, sources said. The new owner will contribute US$487m in new equity, while management will roll over around US$35m of their existing stakes, accounting for roughly 31% of capitalization, the sources added. The debt load has catalyzed concerns among some potential investors, especially since the company is still exposed to regulatory uncertainty, which in the past has caused its debt to trade even at distressed levels. On the regulatory front, Securus has historically been targeted by the Federal Communications Commission for excessive charges. The agencyâs most recent attempt at reforming them, by proposing caps on intrastate phone rates, was stayed following changes in FCC leadership under the Trump administration, pending a final ruling expected by the end of 2017. Other tailwinds have arisen for now, including the unwinding of the Department of Justiceâs plan under former President Obama to phase out the federal governmentâs use of private prisons, and Presidents Trumpâs resolve to take a hard line on immigration and low-level crimes, which would likely spur growth of the prison population. âSecularly, there are some positive trends for the sector. But as with just about any regulatory risk, I generally donât believe the new administration has completely eliminated any threat here,â a source said. A Deutsche Bank spokesperson declined to comment. Platinum Equity did not respond to requests for comment.

She was 92.  She took over the helm of the Clarin newspaper in 1969 after the death of her husband Roberto Noble, the paper's founder. At the time of her death, she was one of four controlling shareholders of Grupo Clarin, Argentina's largest media conglomerate.   Under Herrera de Noble's leadership, Clarin acquired radio stations and television channels on its way to becoming the South American country's largest media group.  Late in her tenure, Grupo Clarin, which is listed on the Buenos Aires bourse, became locked in a dispute with former Argentine President Cristina Fernandez after its news outlets criticized the populist leader's handling of a 2008 uprising by farmers.  Fernandez encouraged an investigation into the identity of Herrera de Noble's two adopted children, who human rights groups long suspected were stolen as babies from murdered political prisoners during Argentina's military dictatorship from 1976 to 1983.  The 10-year battle with activists came to an end in 2011 when tests showed the two children's DNA did not match samples from 55 families seeking to identify missing relatives. Up to 30,000 people were kidnapped and killed during the so-called Dirty War in a crackdown on leftist dissent, according to rights groups. Criticized for having too much political influence and market share, Grupo Clarin was nearly forced to break up under a Fernandez-backed anti-monopoly law. Clarin has a 41 percent share of the Buenos Aires area newspaper market, according to a recent securities filing.  They will not get us to stop doing journalism,  Herrera de Noble said at a 2010 speech, according to an obituary published on Wednesday on Clarin's website.   They have put the whole state against us. But we will continue defending with the truth and the law, as always.

Energy stocks led Wall Street lower, while Treasury yields fell. Oil prices fell to their lowest in over five weeks following the U.S. gasoline data and International Energy Agency (IEA) data projecting an increase in non-OPEC production.  Oil futures are being dragged down by gasoline futures. The industry continues to turn a crude oil surplus into a gasoline and distillate product surplus,  Andrew Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates in Houston said. U.S. crude fell 3.57 percent to $44.80 per barrel and Brent was last at $47.01, down 3.51 percent on the day. The dollar index touched its lowest since Nov. 9 as the biggest drop in retail sales in 16 months and retreating inflation pressures were seen affecting monetary policymakers' view that the economic soft patch was transitory.  The numbers cast serious, serious doubt on whether there will be another hike this year,  said Greg Anderson, global head of foreign exchange strategy at BMO Capital Markets in New York. The widely expected quarter-point interest rate hike after the current Fed meeting wraps up later on Wednesday will take the Fed funds target rate above 1 percent for the first time since the immediate aftermath of the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008. The dollar index fell 0.54 percent, with the euro up 0.55 percent to $1.1276. The Japanese yen strengthened 0.83 percent versus the greenback at 109.18 per dollar, while Sterling was last trading at $1.2806, up 0.44 percent on the day. U.S. interest rates futures rose after the weak data, suggesting traders reduced their bets on a possible third Fed interest rate increase in 2017.  We think this effectively takes September off the table,  said Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rates strategy at BMO Capital Markets in New York, in reference to the impact of the data on the probability of a September Fed rate increase. Benchmark 10-year notes last rose 27/32 in price to yield 2.1151 percent, from 2.207 percent late on Tuesday. Energy sector shares tracked the slide in crude prices and weighed on the S&P; 500, which had been trading higher earlier in the session. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 9.06 points, or 0.04 percent, to 21,337.53, the S&P; 500 lost 2.38 points, or 0.10 percent, to 2,437.97 and the Nasdaq Composite added 7.87 points, or 0.13 percent, to 6,228.24. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index lost 0.18 percent and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.18 percent. Emerging market stocks rose 0.63 percent. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 0.73 percent higher. Gold rose after the weaker-than-expected U.S. data knocked the dollar. Spot gold added 0.9 percent to $1,276.44 an ounce. U.S. gold futures gained 0.78 percent to $1,278.50 an ounce. Copper lost 0.30 percent to $5,700.00 a tonne.

The ruling Communist Party newspaper Granma said the date for provincial and national assembly elections would be published  at the corresponding time.  The electoral notice coincides with a period of uncertainty for Cuba. U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to announce  his Cuba policy on Friday, rolling back parts of former President Barack Obama's opening to the island, which included restoration of relations and reopening of embassies in a diplomatic breakthrough between Cold War foes. Meanwhile, the generation that ruled Cuba since the 1959 revolution is dying. And Cuba's main political and trade ally Venezuela is in crisis with triple-digit inflation and shortages of food and medicine fanning protests against the socialist government. Castro, who took over the presidency in 2008 from his ailing and now deceased brother Fidel Castro, has vowed to step down as president next February at the end of his second five-year term. He will, however, remain head of the Communist Party, in which political power is vested in Cuba. All other parties are banned. The government says Cuba's electoral system is one of the world's most democratic because municipal assembly delegates are nominated by neighbors and do not have to belong to the Communist Party. But the path to the National Assembly, and ultimately the presidency, is controlled by the party.

The management change, which also included the resignation of the bank's two deputy CEOs, follows the purchase of a 32.8 percent stake in Pekao by state-run entities. Insurer PZU and state investment vehicle PFR finalised the purchase of the stake last week from Italy's UniCredit . Pekao said in a statement it had appointed Krupinski as deputy CEO pending approval by the Polish Financial Supervisory Authority (KNF), at which point he will be made CEO. Krupinski was CEO of PZU at the time when the state-run insurer decided to buy the Pekao stake for 10.6 billion zloty ($2.84 billion). Lovaglio, 61, who holds both Italian and Polish passports, was appointed to Pekao's board in 2003. He had a reputation as a respected manager who presided over solid financial results. He also resisted temptation to grant Poles the Swiss franc-denominated mortgages that became a serious problem for the banking sector.  Political factors and dividing the spoils have became more important than business. This is inconsistent with pledges that he will lead the bank during the transition period and this is why the share price is down,  one analyst in Warsaw said of Lovaglio's dismissal. By 1430 GMT Pekao shares had recovered to be up 0.5 percent, outperforming the main index of the Warsaw bourse which was down 0.2 percent.

Germany's 10-year yield and most other euro zone equivalents dropped on Wednesday, tracking U.S. Treasury yields that fell sharply after below-forecast inflation and retail sales data reduced expectations that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates in the second half of the year. Markets have fully priced the prospect of the Fed raising its benchmark rate to a target range of 1.00 to 1.25 percent, but investors are waiting for any signals on the future path of rates or details on plans to shrink its massive balance sheet. Following a lacklustre first quarter for economic growth and a retreat in headline inflation to 1.5 percent from 1.8 percent earlier in 2017, there is doubt over whether policymakers can stick to their anticipated pace of tightening of three interest rate rises this year and next. There are also growing doubts on the size and scope of fiscal stimulus the Trump administration may inject into the U.S. economy with campaign promises on tax reform, financial regulation rollbacks and infrastructure spending either still on the drawing board or facing hurdles in Congress.  There is a very large probability of the U.S. ... ratcheting up the fed funds target range,  DZ Bank's Hendrik Lodde said.  It should therefore be more intriguing to see ... whether it is still planning on implementing one further tightening step in the present year ... Doubts on this score have surfaced of late.  Few economists polled by Reuters expect major changes in the Fed's quarterly projections for growth, unemployment and inflation which it will also release on Wednesday. Investors will also be looking for a clearer steer on the timing and details of its previously announced plan to reduce this year its $4.2 trillion portfolio of Treasury debt and mortgage-backed securities, most of which were purchased in the wake of the financial crisis to help bolster the economy. German 10-year yields fell 4 basis points to 0.23 percent on Wednesday, its lowest level for over seven weeks, while French and Spanish equivalents hit multi-month lows. The yield on 10-year U.S. Treasuries was down as much as 10 basis points to 2.10 percent, the lowest level since November 10, the day after the U.S. election. The gap between the two benchmarks edged away from a one-month wide point of 197 basis points hit in the wake of a European Central Bank meeting last week in which policymakers pledged to maintain ultra-easy policy as inflation remained weak.

The peso fell to its lowest level in history against the dollar on Jan. 19, the day before U.S. President Donald Trump's inauguration, as traders worried that his campaign pledges to scrap the North American Free Trade Agreement and erect a wall between the two countries would weaken the Mexican economy. But since Trump moved into the White House the peso has been on a tear, rising more than 20 percent against the dollar. It has been the world's best performing major currency so far this year. Rhetoric from Trump's administration has become less corrosive since he took office. This and the Bank of Mexico's aggressive monetary policy, including unexpectedly raising its benchmark interest rate last month to an eight-year high of 6.75 percent, have helped the peso firm to its highest level since Aug. 16.

And though it is no longer cheap, it also does not look expensive in terms of purchasing power parity.  One of the primary factors helping the peso's rise has been the reversal of speculator positions on the currency. Last week, speculators raised the number of net-long contracts on the peso to 84,821, the highest since June 2014.  This is partly due to the changes in U.S. politics, and partly as global economic headwinds have dissipated somewhat â allowing carry trades to flourish again,  said Ken Dickson, investment director, foreign exchange, at Standard Life Investments. Javier Murcio, senior sovereign analyst for emerging market strategies at Standish, a division of Bank of New York Mellon Corp, said the results of recent state elections in which left-wing candidates were unable to unseat traditional powers was also a strong sign.

Chances for further appreciation remain, but as the inflation adjusted exchange rate begins to lose competitiveness, important floors may appear at 18/USD or even 17.75, which are levels at which further gains may be difficult to sustain,  Murcio said in an email. Alejo Czerwonko, an emerging market strategist at UBS Wealth Management, said earlier this week that while he remains bullish, the peso is nearing the asset manager's target of 18 pesos per dollar. The peso broke through that level Wednesday morning after data showing unexpectedly soft U.S. consumer prices and retail sales data.

Foreign investors are vying for business in riverine Gambia, which has a population of just 2 million and a GDP of around $900 million, following 22 years of autocratic rule. Yahya Jammeh was eventually driven into exile from the West African country through a combination of pleas and military threats after losing an election. The Banjul port at the mouth of the Gambia River -- a key transport lane for shipping peanuts -- has been run for decades by a government agency. Industry sources say activities were limited by the port's size and the heavy involvement of the army. But they say trade has the potential to boom, given its proximity to a major Atlantic sea lane and improved relations with neighbouring Senegal, which surrounds it on three sides. Senegal is also working with its neighbour to complete a long-awaited bridge that will help link Dakar and Lagos via a coastal road. French billionaire Vincent Bollore's firm, which already has a sprawling African business empire, signalled its interest in the project shortly after President Adama Barrow was sworn in in February and was part of a French investment delegation in May, according to the industry, banking and diplomatic sources who asked not to be named as talks continue. One of them said Bollore planned to invest more than $200 million in the port concession, although two other sources say there are in discussions with partners to boost the total Gambian investment package to around $1 billion. It was not clear what the larger investment package would include and the sources stressed that it was not finalised. Bollore declined to give an official comment. The African Export-Import Bank is also considering offering financing for the upgrade and expansion of ports in Gambia and related logistics infrastructure, although it could not be established that this was linked to the Bollore offer. Yankuba Saidy, permanent secretary for investments at the president's office, told Reuters that Gambia had received  lots  of offers for the port, including from Bollore, and that a partner had not yet been chosen. Bollore's subsidiary, Bollore Africa Logistics, operates container ports in more than a dozen African countries, including a roll-on, roll-off terminal in Dakar which, like Banjul, affords access to landlocked Mali and Burkina Faso.

The spike in prices is probably temporary and wages remain subdued. But the countryâs fragile government will add to bond investorsâ nerves. Carney and his fellow rate-setters are keeping UK policy rates at a record low of 0.25 percent even though prices rose 2.9 percent in May â the highest level in nearly four years and almost a full percentage point above the central bankâs target. That makes sense. While sterlingâs weakness after last yearâs EU referendum has made imported goods pricier, the effect will fade. Moreover, inflation is more likely to depress consumption than trigger a self-feeding spiral of rising prices. Average total pay, which includes bonuses, fell 0.4 percent in the three months to April from a year earlier after taking account of inflation, the national statistics office said on Wednesday. It was the biggest drop in British real wages since 2014. Even so, it is becoming harder for UK rate-setters to do nothing. First, the lack of a clear winner in last weekâs elections means fiscal policy is likely to be looser than before. Prime Minister Theresa Mayâs government is likely to shelve unpopular austerity measures and spend more than previously planned in an attempt to win back disillusioned voters. If politicians are doing more to help the economy, monetary policymakers might feel they can get away with doing less. Higher public spending does not necessarily mean more growth. Uncertainty over the governmentâs Brexit negotiations risks hurting business confidence and investment. But thereâs another nascent problem brewing in the debt markets. Yields on British government bonds rose sharply after inflation figures were published on Tuesday. Though those moves were reversed the following day and yields remain very low, the move hints at a lurking nervousness. Purchases of UK assets by foreigners help Britain fund its current account deficit, which was 4.4 percent of GDP last year. If inflation or fiscal worries spur overseas investors to sell gilts, UK borrowing costs could rise and sterling may fall further. That would dwarf any of the challenges facing Carney today.BreakingviewsReuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said in May shipments were set to drop from June, particularly to the United States, as the top OPEC producer aims to limit supply to help balance the market. Exports in May, when the kingdom's total production was 9.880 million bpd, averaged below 7 million bpd, three industry and shipping sources told Reuters. Early indications suggest that remains the case this month, one of the sources said.  I'm only looking at the first week of June, and on the face of it there's not much change,  said Roy Mason of Oil Movements, a UK-based firm that estimates supply by tracking tanker shipments. Indicating lower Saudi exports, he said tanker movements suggested shipments to the United States were  less than would be seasonally normal.  Lower exports could help reduce bloated inventories in the United States, the world's largest and most transparent oil market. High stockpiles have weighed on crude prices. U.S. oil imports from Saudi Arabia were above 1 million bpd from May-August last year, according to U.S. government data.   So far in June, Saudi exports to the United States were below 1 million bpd, according to shipping data and industry sources. Overall, Saudi exports are set to be lower than last year, when the kingdom shipped about 7.4 million bpd on average from May to August. This is partly because Saudi Arabia usually burns more crude in power stations at home in the summer months to meet extra demand for power as people rely on air conditioners to deal with temperatures that can reach 50 degrees Celsius. This year, Saudi Arabia is also leading OPEC and other producers in a pact to cut output, a deal initially due to run during the first half of 2017 and now extended until March 2018. Under the deal, the kingdom should not produce more than 10.058 million bpd until March. In the first five months of 2017, its output has been below that target. Industry sources with knowledge of Saudi crude exports data said state oil company Saudi Aramco aimed to cut its exports to the United Sates to below 1 million bpd in June and July.  Aramco has raised its official selling oil prices (OSPs) for its crude to the United States for July, a move seen as discouraging a further buildup in U.S. oil inventories.  The high-price numbers prompted U.S. refiners to lower nominations,  one industry source said.  The company has cut allocations in July to the United States by 35 percent and to Europe by 11 percent in July. Allocations to Asia were cut by some 300,000 bpd. Reuters shipping data also points to Saudi exports below 7 million bpd in the first two weeks of June, averaging 6.98 million bpd. Last year, Saudi Arabia burned 700,000 bpd of crude to generate power in the peak summer months. That figure was expected to fall by about 100,000-120,000 bpd this year, as the kingdom uses more natural gas, one industry source said. Two sources said Saudi Arabia could draw from inventories to meet local and export requirements if needed. Saudi inventories rose to 267.854 million barrels in March from 264.704 million in February, according to official data. But the kingdom would still keep crude production and supply within its OPEC target, another source said.

The Czechs joined the EU in 2004 and committed to one day giving up its own currency, the crown, for the euro. But successive governments have put off setting a date for the change. Asked at a conference on Wednesday if the country would join the euro zone in the next five to 10 years, Rusnok said,  If I had to ... bet, I would say no.   Generally, I do not see enough power and enough will,  he added in comments reported by Czech news agency CTK. It is up to the government to decide on adopting the euro, with the central bank mainly advising. The euro has gained little support among Czech politicians, expecially since the global financial crisis almost a decade ago. The euro zone has struggled to cope with problems like Greece's debt, and economists say one reason is the rigidity of a single monetary policy imposed by the European Central Bank. Former Finance Minister Andrej Babis has said joining the euro would  bring nothing good . His ANO political movement leads polls by a wide margin before an October parliamentary election, making him a frontrunner to lead the next government . Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka, whose Social Democrats have slipped in polls, told a Reuters Summit in May the next government should lead talks with unions and employers over conditions for euro adoption and set an entry date, though that would be beyond the next parliamentary term, which ens in 2021.

Last week, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt decided to cut diplomatic ties with Qatar and impose stringent economic sanctions on the country, which threatened to suck deposits from its banks and curb foreign investment. In an emailed response to questions, QNB said it had a  robust  liquidity position.  There are no significant outflows of deposits and other funds ... except for business as usual rollovers and, or maturities,  QNB said. The bank maintained a prudent capital adequacy ratio,  well in excess  of local regulatory and Basel III (international) requirements and continued to generate growth in profitability, it said. QNB's capital adequacy ratio stood at 15.7 percent at the end of March, compared to the minimum required by Qatar's central bank of 14.8 percent.  The group manages its liquidity very wisely and benefits from a diversified local and international funding base holding a global footprint across Europe, Asia, and MEA [Middle East, Africa], with a very minimal funding from the GCC markets,  QNB said. Qatar National Bank gets 56 percent of its funding and 49 percent of its deposits from outside Qatar, according to Goldman Sachs. Last week's action by the Arab powers included the blacklisting of a number of entities and individuals with links to Qatar. The UAE central bank also urged banks in the UAE to act with caution in dealing with six Qatari banks, including QNB. QNB, which is 50-percent owned by the Qatar Investment Authority, has a presence, either directly or through affiliates, in more than 30 markets including Egypt, Turkey, the UAE and several African countries. The bank said it had not seen any impact on its overall group operations from its business in Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. The bank's business in Egypt was fully independent from a funding perspective with no reliance on the group, it said. In the UAE, it operates through Commercial Bank International, a 40 percent-owned affiliate, which it said had no direct business links to QNB. It said the contribution of CBI to QNB's overall business was minimal. QNB said its branch in Saudi Arabia was in a start-up phase. QNB last month inaugurated a branch in Riyadh offering retail and corporate banking services. The bank also planned to apply for an investment banking licence in Saudi Arabia, QNB Group Chief Executive Officer Ali Ahmed al-Kuwari told reporters last month. (Reporting by Tom Arnold.

U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan said  blanket suppression  was necessary because  sweeping  January 2012 searches of Wey's Manhattan apartment and the offices of his consulting firm, New York Global Group, violated his Fourth Amendment constitutional right against illegal searches and seizures. In a 92-page decision on Tuesday night, the Manhattan judge said prosecutors failed to show they needed broad warrants because they had probable cause to believe Wey's entire business was a scam. Items seized included children's school records, divorce records, family photos, medical records, prescription documents, recreational schedules, resumes and X-rays, the judge said.  This conduct reflects, at least, grossly negligent or reckless disregard of the strictures of the Fourth Amendment,  Nathan wrote. A spokeswoman for Acting U.S. Attorney Joon Kim in Manhattan declined to comment. Wey's lawyer David Siegal said  it's hard to imagine what other evidence won't be tainted  in the case, given how the searches were conducted early in the probe.  We're preparing for trial, and the government has some hard decisions to make,  he said. A trial is scheduled for Oct. 2. In reverse mergers, Chinese companies buy U.S.  shell  companies and assume their stock tickers. This lets them raise money without regulatory reviews typical for newly public companies. Dozens of reverse mergers occurred nearly a decade ago, but many soured amid questions about accounting and disclosures. Wey was charged in September 2015 with eight criminal counts including securities fraud, wire fraud and money laundering. Prosecutors said he secretly controlled large blocks of shares in shell companies that went through reverse mergers, leaving him with big stakes in Nasdaq-listed CleanTech Innovations Inc, Deer Consumer Products Inc and SmartHeat Inc. Wey then manipulated the companies' stock prices, and sold shares at artificially high levels, prosecutors said. The defendant pleaded not guilty, and according to his firm's website  never settles false claims.  Nathan had in January refused to dismiss the indictment. Also charged was Wey's Switzerland-based banker Seref Dogan Erbek, who remains at large. Wey was also in the news in June 2015, when a federal jury ordered him to pay $18 million to a former employee in a sexual harassment case. The award was later cut to $5.65 million. Wey appealed, and has denied wrongdoing. The case is U.S. v. Wey, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 15-cr-00611.

Recent disputes over an election law that is at the heart of the nation's sectarian political system had pushed Lebanon to the brink of crisis, threatening to leave it without a parliament for the first time. The new law will extend parliament's term by almost a year until next May, avoiding a legislative vacuum when the chamber's current term ends on June 20.  It will create a proportional representation system for parliament and alter the number of districts from which lawmakers are elected, among other changes.   Today, cabinet approved the law ... with an extension of parliament's term by 11 months for technical reasons  to prepare for the polls under the new law, Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri said. Parliament, which is set to meet on Friday, must now also  approve the law.  Elections are likely to take place on May 6, 2018 and parliament could extend its term until May 20, Information Minister Melhem Riachy told journalists earlier on Wednesday.

Dalati Nohra/Handout via REUTERSSectarian divisions have long plagued politics in Lebanon, exacerbated by the Syrian conflict and complicated by rivalry between Iran and Saudi Arabia, which back different groups in the country. Lebanese activists accuse politicians of using regional upheaval as an excuse to dodge elections.      Protesters took to the streets of Beirut after the two previous parliamentary extensions, which critics, including the European Union, condemned as unconstitutional.     Politicians had been unable to agree on a new law for years because of fundamental disagreements between the parties, including over representation and how to conduct the vote.  Most political parties had rejected holding new legislative elections based on the existing system, a sectarian-based law that dates back to 1960.

U.S. retail sales recorded their biggest drop in 16 months, while consumer prices fell unexpectedly in May, raising questions about the Fed's ability to further tighten monetary policy. While traders continued to see a more than 93 percent chance for the Fed to raise rates at the end of the two-day meeting on Wednesday, they dialed back the odds of a third hike this year. The S&P; 500 financial sector fell 0.6 percent, led by declines in big banks that stand to gain from higher interest rates. The economic data also pressured the dollar index, which fell to its lowest since Nov. 9.  With the weak data, you start to wonder why the Fed is so bent on raising rate. It seems they should be doing the opposite,  said Robert Pavlik, chief market strategist at Boston Private Wealth.  I think some Fed members are going to be skeptical about raising rates for the third time later this year, but I don't think they will step up and say they shouldn't be doing it today.  The Fed meeting could also provide details on the central bank's plans to trim its $4.5 trillion balance sheet. At 10:54 a.m. ET (1454 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1.54 points, or 0.01 percent, at 21,326.93. The index had hit an all-time high of 21,345.56, earlier in the session. The S&P; 500 was down 1.67 points, or 0.07 percent, at 2,438.68 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 3.90 points, or 0.06 percent, at 6,224.27. Five of the 11 major S&P; sectors were lower, with energy declining 2.2 percent as oil prices tumbled after data showed a surprise build in U.S. inventories. Exxon and Chevron were the top drags on the S&P; and the Dow. Johnson & Johnson rose 0.6 percent to $132.76 after the company's flu drug succeeded in a mid-stage trial. The stock provided the biggest boost to the S&P; and the Dow. Facebook, Mircosoft and Alphabet, which had been hit hard by a selloff in the tech sector earlier this week, rose for the second straight day.

The Washington-based industry group said its seasonally adjusted index on refinancing rose 9.2 percent from the prior week to 1,494.8 in the week of June 9. This was the highest level since 1,754.2 in the Nov. 18 week. Declining borrowing costs may encourage more homeowners to seek new loans to either reduce their mortgage rates or borrow against the equity in their homes, analysts said.  We might see a burst of refinancing activity,  said Doug Duncan, chief economist at Fannie Mae in Washington. Interest rates on conforming 30-year fixed-rate mortgages fell to 4.13 percent, the lowest since the week of Nov. 11, from 4.14 percent the prior week. Conforming loans are those with balances of $424,100 or less which qualify for guarantees from federal mortgage agencies Fannie Mae (FNMA.PK) and Freddie Mac (FMCC.PK). Average rates on other types of 30-year loans the MBA tracks were 0.01 to 0.02 percentage point lower than the prior week. Home borrowing costs have fallen in step with bond yields as recent economic data raised doubts whether inflation would be stuck below the Federal Reserve's 2 percent goal for longer than previously thought. On Wednesday, benchmark U.S. Treasury yields US10YT=RR fell to 2.11 percent, their lowest level since Nov. 10, in reaction to data that showed consumer inflation rose less than what traders had expected for a third straight month in May. Last week's decline in mortgage rates, however, failed to spur requests for loans to buy a home. MBA's seasonally adjusted gauge of applications to home purchase, a proxy for future home sales, fell 2.8 percent to 254.6 last week.  In the preceding week, the group's purchase activity index reached its highest level since the week of May 2, 2010. The group's seasonally adjusted index of total mortgage applications increased 2.8 percent to 442.6, its highest level since the week of Nov. 18. The share of refinancing expanded to 45.4 percent of total applications from 42.1 percent the previous week.

The sale has seen much last-minute jockeying by suitors, leaving the conglomerate little time to come to a decision by its shareholders meeting at the end of this month. Toshiba is seeking a minimum of $18 billion for the world's second-biggest producer of NAND chips and wants to get the deal done as quickly as possible to help it cover billions of dollars in cost overruns at now-bankrupt nuclear unit Westinghouse. Given the jockeying, Toshiba has given up on choosing a winning bid on Thursday to negotiate the deal, said a person with direct knowledge of the matter. Sources had said the company was aiming for a Thursday decision, though a spokeswoman insisted the deadline for the decision was the second half of June. A state-backed fund, the Innovation Network Corp of Japan (INCJ), has been at the center of trade ministry efforts to forge a successful bid that will keep the highly prized unit under domestic control. But the nature of its partnerships appears to be going through drastic changes compared to just last week. Standard & Poor's said on Thursday it remained poised to cut Toshiba's CCC- long-term credit rating  because its plan to sell its memory business has yet to materialize and additional losses or financial burdens might still arise in connection with its U.S. nuclear power business.   Drawn-out talks over its sale raise the risk of further clouding the timing and amount of the sale if the market or conditions in which the business operates worsen more than the company assumes,  S&P; said. INCJ was part of a proposed bid tabled by U.S. chipmaker Western Digital last week that also included U.S. private equity firm KKR & Co LP, sources familiar with the matter have said. But other sources have also said INCJ is in talks with Bain Capital about bidding for the unit, as the U.S. private equity firm appears willing to put in more money than rivals. The Asahi newspaper reported on Wednesday that INCJ was now in a consortium that included Bain, KKR, SK Hynix as well as the Development Bank of Japan (DBJ). Western Digital, which jointly operates Toshiba's main chip plant but is now in a bitter dispute with the conglomerate over whether the auction can proceed without its consent, was not included. The INCJ bid would also exceed 2 trillion yen ($18 billion), the newspaper said. A person familiar with the matter told Reuters on Wednesday that SK Hynix would be providing a loan to help finance the bid although it would not be taking a direct stake. Another person briefed on the matter said the Asahi report was correct on the participants in the consortium. The sources declined to be identified as they were not authorized to talk to the media on the matter. Mana Nakazora, chief credit analyst at BNP Paribas, said the complexity of the situation now meant that the auction could only be settled with the government's intervention.  While the makeup of the Japan-U.S. consortium may well change, it's increasingly unlikely that there are other options,  she said. Fierce Battle Other suitors are also making last-minute pitches. One source familiar with the matter said on Wednesday that Western Digital was still in talks with the trade ministry over their consortium. The California-based firm has decided to raise its offer to at least 2 trillion yen, a separate source said on the weekend. The CEO of Foxconn told Reuters on Monday the Taiwanese firm was leading a group including Apple Inc, computing giant Dell Inc and Kingston Technology Co. The highest reported bid so far is one from U.S. chipmaker Broadcom and its partner, U.S. private equity firm Silver Lake. They have offered 2.2 trillion yen, sources have said. According to the Asahi report, INCJ, DBJ and Bain would each invest 300 billion yen in a special-purpose company to buy the unit, Toshiba Memory Corp. Toshiba itself would contribute up to 100 billion yen and other Japanese firms a combined 140 billion yen, while KKR is considering putting in 100 billion yen, the Asahi said. It added that SK Hynix would lend 300 billion yen to the project and Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ 400 billion yen. Toshiba, SK Hynix, INCJ, Bain, KKR and a spokesman for the core unit of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc declined to comment. The trade ministry and DBJ did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Shares in Toshiba ended down 4 percent on Wednesday, hurt by a newspaper report that the conglomerate would not be able to file its annual report by the end of this month.

The new tool, called BlockOne IQ, will allow Wall Street firms to use Thomson Reuters data on trading systems that run on Ethereum and Corda, two types of blockchain, the company said. Thomson Reuters, which sells data, news and other information, owns Reuters News. Like competitors including Bloomberg LP and IHS Markit Ltd that provide market data and software to Wall Street, it has been ramping up investments in new technologies like blockchain as customers have started to embrace them. The idea behind BlockOne IQ is to speed up deployment of blockchain in financial markets, Sam Chadwick, Thomson Reutersâ director of strategy in innovation and blockchain, said in an interview. The technology maintains a record of transactions through a network of computers rather than one centralized authority, and was first conceived as a way to trade the digital currency bitcoin. Big banks, investors and other financial institutions have invested millions of dollars in blockchain, hoping that it could make transactions faster, easier and more secure. But it has not yet been used on a wide scale, partly because of a disconnect with technologies that underpin other applications, said Chadwick.  A lot of the financial use-cases rely quite heavily on knowing and including real-world data, but there is really no way to do it,  he said. Tools like BlockOne IQ are known as  oracles  in financial-technology circles, because they allow the two different technologies to communicate with one another.

The Burnaby, British Columbia-based company expects to sign a deal by the third quarter of 2017, Gateway Executive Chairman Gabriel de Alba said in an interview last week, without disclosing the names of the interested parties. The company, which said there was some interest from European firms as well, kicked-off a formal review to monetize its real estate portfolio after being approached by local and international developers interested in acquiring and developing the Vancouver properties, de Alba said. Gateway's portfolio includes licenses for undeveloped land with no facilities. The company declined to provide the total value of its real estate portfolio outside the three Vancouver sites.  Now that we're formalizing the process, we're reaching out to other bidders and certainly as the process is known, some other bidders are jumping on board as well,  said de Alba. The proposals include development of condos, hotels, movie theaters, or even an Asian market place, to also attract casual gamers looking for additional forms of entertainment during a visit. Gateway Casinos was bought in 2010 by Toronto-based private equity firm, The Catalyst Capital Group Inc, which restructured the company, reduced its debt by about C$1 billion, and injected C$200 million in new capital. Gateway, which recently expanded operations in Ontario, could eventually launch an initial public offering (IPO) subject to capital market conditions, Chief Executive Tony Santo said in the interview. An IPO could help fund other opportunities Gateway is working on, Santo said, such as further expansion in Ontario or greenfield developments in British Columbia. The company dropped its 2012 IPO plans and instead did a dividend recapitalization, which allowed the owners to recoup some investments without reducing their stake in the company, De Alba said. De Alba, who is also a managing director and partner at Catalyst, said Gateway has grown from nine properties and an EBITDA of C$93 million in 2011 after restructuring, to 28 properties and an EBITDA target of more than C$235 million next year.

Euro zone inflation has been low for years and the ECB is not expecting to achieve its objective of a rate near 2 percent for at least another two years, despite spending 2.3 trillion euros ($2.59 trillion) on bond purchases and pushing interest rates below zero. Speaking at a conference packed with current and former ECB policymakers, Nowotny asked whether adopting an inflation range, rather than a specific target, would make more sense in a situation where price growth is low for a long time.  Could you foresee that in such a situation there would be an easing or broadening of the inflation goal in the sense of setting a range instead of a clear-cut target?  Nowotny, an Austrian, asked at an event organized by Germany's Bundesbank. Any such move would allow the ECB to dial back its stimulus measures earlier, pleasing critics in Germany and other northern European countries, who fear the ultra-easy policy is creating bubbles. But it would potentially make funding more expensive for indebted governments in the south of the bloc, such as Italy and Portugal. Economists have long wondered whether the historically low inflation rates seen in the euro zone and Japan were due to factors beyond central banks' reach, such as an ageing population and structurally high unemployment. But the very notion of abandoning its inflation target has been anathema to ECB rate setters, who fear any mention of it would dent its credibility with investors.  We need more than ever very solid anchoring of long-term inflation expectations,  former ECB president Jean-Claude Trichet said.  We are still in an extremely dangerous situation.     ECB President Mario Draghi batted back a similar question at a news conference last week, saying the central bank was confident inflation would hit its objective once unemployment falls. But Japan's former central bank governor Masaaki Shirkawa, who also battled with ultra-low inflation during his five-year tenure ending in 2013, expressed some sympathy for Nowotny's argument.  My worry with setting a precise number is that it can crowd out other very important considerations, such as financial stability,  Shirkawa said, speaking at the same conference.  Tasked by European Union treaties to maintain price stability in the euro zone, the ECB has fine-tuned its target in the past. It initially set its objective as an inflation rate  below 2 percent  in 1998 but five years later it changed it to  below, but close to 2 percent over the medium term .

Ooredoo's instrument ratings have also been placed on RWN. A full list of rating actions is available at the end of this commentary. This rating action follows that on Qatar's sovereign rating on 12 June 2017 when Fitch placed Qatar's 'AA' Long-Term Foreign- and Local-Currency IDRs on (RWN). Given the continued strength of Ooredoo's links with the State of Qatar (AA/RWN), Ooredoo's ratings are two notches lower than the Qatar's, in accordance with Fitch's Parent and Subsidiary Rating Linkage methodology. Qatar directly and indirectly owns 69% of Ooredoo. KEY RATING DRIVERS State Support: Fitch continues to apply its parent and subsidiary rating linkage methodology in rating Ooredoo. The ratings reflect Ooredoo's strong operational and strategic ties with Qatar. Legal ties are underpinned by the presence of a change of control covenant in Ooredoo's financing documentation should Qatar cease to control the group. This implied state support underpins the strong rating and offsets risks associated with the company's diversification into weaker rated emerging markets, slowing sector growth and M&A.; Improved Operating Profile: Ooredoo's revenue grew 1% in 2016, after falling 2% and 3% in 2014 and 2015, respectively, when the company came under pressure from both FX fluctuations and weaker economic conditions in some key markets. The on-going political tension in Iraq has caused significant revenue declines over the past few years. In 2016, performance in Indonesia (25% of 2016 revenue) was satisfactory, while EBITDA losses in Myanmar have narrowed significantly. Domestic Market May Slow: Ooredoo generated approximately 25% of its consolidated revenue in 2016 (and 31% of EBITDA) from Qatar and we expect the contribution from the domestic business to remain significant in the coming years. Domestic revenue and EBITDA trends may weaken, due to a weaker economic environment amid current political challenges, and as competitive pressure continues unabated. Conservative Leverage Profile Likely: Ooredoo's reported consolidated net debt/EBITDA ended 2016 at 2.0x, within the company's target of 1.5x-2.5x. Fitch expects Ooredoo to continue to operate within its target as leverage gradually declines over the next three years. Leverage may increase significantly due to a large acquisition, even though we believe this is unlikely in the near term. However, we believe that if the group breaches these levels and struggles to deleverage within the next 18-24 months, forthcoming equity support from Qatar would help reduce debt and place leverage on a more stable footing. DERIVATION SUMMARY Ooredoo is the leading telecoms operator in Qatar, with operations in the Middle East, south-east Asia and north Africa. The ratings reflect the continued strength of Ooredoo's links with the State of Qatar. Ooredoo's ratings are two notches lower than Qatar's sovereign rating, in accordance with Fitch's Parent and Subsidiary Rating Linkage methodology. Qatar directly and indirectly owns 69% of Ooredoo. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issue include: - No change in the implied support and commitment from, and ownership by, Qatar; - Flat revenue growth in 2017 with limited growth in 2018, assuming no further significant moves in exchange rates; - Stable EBITDA margin in 2017 and 2018. - Capex at around 20% of revenue in 2017 and 2018. We expect capex will largely be financed with internally generated funds. RATING SENSITIVITIES Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action - Explicit guarantees from Qatar in favour of Ooredoo, which would likely result in positive rating action on Ooredoo's IDRs, providing that the other parent-subsidiary linkages do not weaken. - Positive rating action on Qatar. Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action - A downgrade of the sovereign rating or an adverse change in implied support and commitment from as well as importance to and ownership by, Qatar. - Significant acquisitions that breach the company's maximum net debt/EBITDA of 2.5x without deleveraging below that level within 18-24 months, indicating weaker state support. Sovereign Rating Sensitivities Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to a Removal of the RWN and the Affirmation of Qatar's Ratings - Timely normalisation of Qatar's external relations without an adverse impact on the economy or other credit metrics. Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to a Downgrade - Absence of a timely resolution to Qatar's isolation. - Further escalation of measures against Qatar. - Evidence that the measures taken against Qatar are having a significant impact on the economy or other credit metrics.

The Washington-based industry group said its seasonally adjusted index on refinancing rose 9.2 percent from the prior week to 1,494.8 in the week of June 9. This was the highest level since 1,754.2 in the Nov. 18 week. Declining borrowing costs may encourage more homeowners to seek new loans to either reduce their mortgage rates or borrow against the equity in their homes, analysts said.  We might see a burst of refinancing activity,  said Doug Duncan, chief economist at Fannie Mae in Washington. Interest rates on conforming 30-year fixed-rate mortgages fell to 4.13 percent, the lowest since the week of Nov. 11, from 4.14 percent the prior week. Conforming loans are those with balances of $424,100 or less which qualify for guarantees from federal mortgage agencies Fannie Mae (FNMA.PK) and Freddie Mac (FMCC.PK). Average rates on other types of 30-year loans the MBA tracks were 0.01 to 0.02 percentage point lower than the prior week. Home borrowing costs have fallen in step with bond yields as recent economic data raised doubts whether inflation would be stuck below the Federal Reserve's 2 percent goal for longer than previously thought. On Wednesday, benchmark U.S. Treasury yields US10YT=RR fell to 2.11 percent, their lowest level since Nov. 10, in reaction to data that showed consumer inflation rose less than what traders had expected for a third straight month in May. Last week's decline in mortgage rates, however, failed to spur requests for loans to buy a home. MBA's seasonally adjusted gauge of applications to home purchase, a proxy for future home sales, fell 2.8 percent to 254.6 last week.  In the preceding week, the group's purchase activity index reached its highest level since the week of May 2, 2010. The group's seasonally adjusted index of total mortgage applications increased 2.8 percent to 442.6, its highest level since the week of Nov. 18.

The sport's drive for medals meant behavioral issues were not addressed as British Cycling lost sight of basic duties of care to staff, said the Cycling Independent Review (CIR), which also criticized the former technical director, Shane Sutton, and UK Sport, the government's funding organization.  Many WCP staff members referred to a 'culture of fear' in terms of retribution or losing employment,  it said.  The panel found that there were failings in British Cycling's governance and leadership, monitoring and supervision of the WCP (World Class Programme), training and development, and management and communications with staff and athletes,  it added.  The CIR also  drew attention  to the Commissioning Board  unsubstantiated evidence  made by some contributors of alleged financial irregularities and historic doping. The CIR said it had not investigated these allegations. The findings will be hugely embarrassing for one of Britain's most successful and heavily funded sports which has enjoyed huge success at Olympics and Paralympics after discovering a seemingly endless conveyor belt of sporting talent.  The five-person panel recommended a root-and-branch review of governance, calling for  autocratic  leadership to change, staff to be better trained in equality and discrimination and that future funding be made conditional on implementation of its recommendations. Related CoverageHow the wheels came off British CyclingIt also called for better monitoring of the WCP by UK Sport. The review was jointly commissioned by British Cycling and UK Sport last April after former British Olympian Jess Varnish made allegations of bullying and sexism against Sutton after she was dropped from the team. Other riders also made allegations against Sutton, which he denied. The Australian was suspended but immediately quit. An internal inquiry by the British Cycling Board upheld an allegation that Sutton referred to female riders in insulting terms. The five-strong panel, led by British Rowing chairwoman Annamarie Phelps, said a  power pocket  was created around Sutton following his appointment as technical director in 2014.   Although Shane Sutton has an innate ability to coach riders to medal-winning performances, the Panel heard from numerous contributors that he did not possess the necessary skill-set to lead the WCP,  it said. British Cycling's chairman, Jonathan Browning, said he accepted the report's findings.  We accept, in full, the recommendations and apologize for where we have failed or fallen short,  he said.  Our structures and procedures, especially at the leadership level within the World Class Programme were lacking.   Since the findings were shared with us, we have rapidly made major changes to the WCP and to our leadership, operations and governance so that we can ensure that British Cycling learns these lessons and becomes a world-class governing body.  UK Sport said:  UK Sport acknowledges the need for greater oversight of World Class Programmes, with a particular focus on culture and duty of care.  The CIR said it had accepted 180 written contributions, conducted 44 interviews and considered 11 files of documentation.

If Wednesday's Cycling Independent Review (CIR) lacks the definitive answer, it shines a harsh spotlight on the sport's murkiest corners, where riders and back-up staff cowered in fear of challenging the authorities. Riders were issued with fierce admonishments for perceived failings and discouraged from developing interests outside cycling; staff were denied any form of personal development, and UK Sport, the government funding agency, looked the other way while more athletes stepped up to the winning podium. The report is damning, indicating that all proper workplace practice was sacrificed to the drive for more medals and, as a direct consequence, further funding. Although the culture was unchallenged for years, the CIR makes clear that alarm bells sounded long ago. One member of the World Class Programme (WCP) -- or  medal factory  as it has been labelled -- dated the problems to Beijing 2008 when eight Olympic gold medals delivered a cultural shift from success being an aspiration to a requirement. Shane Sutton's subsequent removal from the team management for allegedly unacceptable behaviour led to a dip in results. But with his return as head coach, and with the advent of Team Sky to work side-by-side with the WCP in 2009, normal medal service was resumed. The link seemed clear and the Australian's position became untouchable. The review suggests the WCP went from being  coach-led, athlete-centred  to  coach-led, coach-centred  with the divisive figure of  old-school  Sutton at its heart.  While his drive and dedication were widely admired, Sutton's colourful language was not, with women riders referred to as  Sheilahs  or worse and BMX riders sidelined. A secret post-2012 British Cycling report highlighted difficulties despite the record 12-medal London haul.  The personal situation regarding interpersonal relationships/behaviours was untenable  and needed urgent address, it said.  Yet nothing was done and UK Sport received only a summary of the report, not its full findings. Morale plummeted and, with Dave Brailsford's departure as British Cycling's performance director in 2014, Sutton was appointed technical director, a role to which most believed he was totally unsuited.   SS did not operate in a way which was always appropriate for a modern work place, even if highly pressurised and at the pinnacle of international sporting competition,  the report found.  Furthermore, SS should not have been placed into a leading management position within the WCP without appropriate support, guidance and training also being put in place for him.  Bullying Claims Staff felt there was no point raising grievances because human resources  were complicit with Shane .  Eventually, the dropping of former World Championships medallist Jess Varnish from the WCP after her failure to qualify for the 2016 Olympics in Rio blew everything apart. Regarded as a  trouble-maker  and  ring-leader  by some who testified to the panel, Varnish went public with allegations of sexism and bullying, and the whole sorry tale began to emerge. Yet the panel is clear on who should bear the real responsibility.  Culture starts at the top of any organisation,  it said, a finding that British Cycling and UK Sport have been quick to accept As the dust settles, British sport could face more problems ahead, with threats of legal action in cycling and accusations of racism and bullying now surfacing in other sports, like bobsleigh and swimming. It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that Britain's recent Olympic success has come at a heavy price.

The sale has seen much last-minute jockeying by suitors, leaving the conglomerate little time to come to a decision by its shareholders meeting at the end of this month. Toshiba is seeking a minimum of $18 billion for the world's second-biggest producer of NAND chips and wants to get the deal done as quickly as possible to help it cover billions of dollars in cost overruns at now-bankrupt nuclear unit Westinghouse. Given the jockeying, Toshiba has given up on choosing a winning bid on Thursday to negotiate the deal, said a person with direct knowledge of the matter. Sources had said the company was aiming for a Thursday decision, though a spokeswoman insisted the deadline for the decision was the second half of June. A state-backed fund, the Innovation Network Corp of Japan (INCJ), has been at the center of trade ministry efforts to forge a successful bid that will keep the highly prized unit under domestic control. But the nature of its partnerships appears to be going through drastic changes compared to just last week. Standard & Poor's said on Thursday it remained poised to cut Toshiba's CCC- long-term credit rating  because its plan to sell its memory business has yet to materialize and additional losses or financial burdens might still arise in connection with its U.S. nuclear power business.   Drawn-out talks over its sale raise the risk of further clouding the timing and amount of the sale if the market or conditions in which the business operates worsen more than the company assumes,  S&P; said. INCJ was part of a proposed bid tabled by U.S. chipmaker Western Digital last week that also included U.S. private equity firm KKR & Co LP, sources familiar with the matter have said. But other sources have also said INCJ is in talks with Bain Capital about bidding for the unit, as the U.S. private equity firm appears willing to put in more money than rivals. The Asahi newspaper reported on Wednesday that INCJ was now in a consortium that included Bain, KKR, SK Hynix as well as the Development Bank of Japan (DBJ). Western Digital, which jointly operates Toshiba's main chip plant but is now in a bitter dispute with the conglomerate over whether the auction can proceed without its consent, was not included. The INCJ bid would also exceed 2 trillion yen ($18 billion), the newspaper said. A person familiar with the matter told Reuters on Wednesday that SK Hynix would be providing a loan to help finance the bid although it would not be taking a direct stake. Another person briefed on the matter said the Asahi report was correct on the participants in the consortium. The sources declined to be identified as they were not authorized to talk to the media on the matter. Mana Nakazora, chief credit analyst at BNP Paribas, said the complexity of the situation now meant that the auction could only be settled with the government's intervention.  While the makeup of the Japan-U.S. consortium may well change, it's increasingly unlikely that there are other options,  she said. Fierce Battle Other suitors are also making last-minute pitches. One source familiar with the matter said on Wednesday that Western Digital was still in talks with the trade ministry over their consortium. The California-based firm has decided to raise its offer to at least 2 trillion yen, a separate source said on the weekend. The CEO of Foxconn told Reuters on Monday the Taiwanese firm was leading a group including Apple Inc, computing giant Dell Inc and Kingston Technology Co. The highest reported bid so far is one from U.S. chipmaker Broadcom and its partner, U.S. private equity firm Silver Lake. They have offered 2.2 trillion yen, sources have said. According to the Asahi report, INCJ, DBJ and Bain would each invest 300 billion yen in a special-purpose company to buy the unit, Toshiba Memory Corp. Toshiba itself would contribute up to 100 billion yen and other Japanese firms a combined 140 billion yen, while KKR is considering putting in 100 billion yen, the Asahi said. It added that SK Hynix would lend 300 billion yen to the project and Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ 400 billion yen. Toshiba, SK Hynix, INCJ, Bain, KKR and a spokesman for the core unit of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc declined to comment. The trade ministry and DBJ did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Shares in Toshiba ended down 4 percent on Wednesday, hurt by a newspaper report that the conglomerate would not be able to file its annual report by the end of this month.

Banks operate in favourable macroeconomic environment which is increasing the confidence of companies and households with stability and forecasts of further (GDP) growth,  the bank said.  In general the sensitivity of banks to systemic risks decreased in 2016 which gives a good basis for a revival of credit activity in this year,  it said. But the bank also warned that low interest rates would put the banks' profitability under pressure. It also said banks needed to watch out for risks from a maturity mismatch that could result from them holding fewer long-term deposits as a result of low rates. The bank said the amount of loans to companies has been growing since December 2016 after falling for several years, which it said signalled the start of a new investment cycle. Bank lending had been shrinking since 2013 when the government had to pour more than 3 billion euros into domestic banks to prevent them from collapsing under a pile of bad loans. Slovenia returned to growth a year later and the central bank expects GDP growth of 3.5 percent this year and 3.1 percent in 2018, boosted by investment, domestic spending and exports. In March, loans to non-banking sector rose by 3 percent year-on-year while the amount of bad loans in local banks fell to 5.2 percent of all loans from 5.5 percent in December, the central bank said in a report last month. Some of the biggest banks in Slovenia are still state-owned and the government controls about 45 percent of the banking sector. The rest are owned by foreign banks and investors, including U.S. investment company Apollo Global Management, Societe Generale, UniCredit and Intesa Sanpaolo, Russia's Sberbank and Austria's Sparkasse and Addiko Bank.

The European Commission announced the investigations on Wednesday but did not provide details of the sales practices.   Nike is aware of the European Commission's investigation and will continue to cooperate with the authorities,  the company said. Universal Studios and Sanrio did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The EU move follows a year-long inquiry by its competition authority into e-commerce practices by 1,900 companies, part of a broader strategy to boost online trade and economic growth. The inquiry found that some companies allow their products to be sold online only by pre-selected distributors, while others use pricing restrictions and even online sales bans to block certain sellers.  We are going to examine whether the licensing and distribution practices of these three companies may be denying consumers access to wider choice and better deals in the single market,  European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said in a statement. Nike is the license rights holder for Barcelona soccer club merchandise, while Sanrio owns the Hello Kitty brand, which adorn items ranging from stationery to clothing.  Universal Studios holds the rights for movies such as Minions and Despicable Me. The new investigations would cover similar issues to those of the e-commerce inquiry, but also include licensing of rights and offline distribution.  They complement the sector inquiry and other pending investigations in so far as they aim to tackle potential barriers to online and offline cross-border trade,  a Commission spokesman said, adding that the case had been brought by the EU executive rather than following a complaint. In February EU antitrust regulators opened three investigations into online sales of consumer electronics makers, video game makers and hotels. Last week the EU announced a probe into U.S. clothing company Guess's (GES.N) cross-border distribution deals.

Euro zone inflation has been low for years and the ECB is not expecting to achieve its objective of a rate near 2 percent for at least another two years, despite spending 2.3 trillion euros ($2.59 trillion) on bond purchases and pushing interest rates below zero. Speaking at a conference packed with current and former ECB policymakers, Nowotny asked whether adopting an inflation range, rather than a specific target, would make more sense in a situation where price growth is low for a long time.  Could you foresee that in such a situation there would be an easing or broadening of the inflation goal in the sense of setting a range instead of a clear-cut target?  Nowotny, an Austrian, asked at an event organized by Germany's Bundesbank. Any such move would allow the ECB to dial back its stimulus measures earlier, pleasing critics in Germany and other northern European countries, who fear the ultra-easy policy is creating bubbles. But it would potentially make funding more expensive for indebted governments in the south of the bloc, such as Italy and Portugal. Economists have long wondered whether the historically low inflation rates seen in the euro zone and Japan were due to factors beyond central banks' reach, such as an ageing population and structurally high unemployment. But the very notion of abandoning its inflation target has been anathema to ECB rate setters, who fear any mention of it would dent its credibility with investors.  We need more than ever very solid anchoring of long-term inflation expectations,  former ECB president Jean-Claude Trichet said.  We are still in an extremely dangerous situation.     ECB President Mario Draghi batted back a similar question at a news conference last week, saying the central bank was confident inflation would hit its objective once unemployment falls. But Japan's former central bank governor Masaaki Shirkawa, who also battled with ultra-low inflation during his five-year tenure ending in 2013, expressed some sympathy for Nowotny's argument.  My worry with setting a precise number is that it can crowd out other very important considerations, such as financial stability,  Shirkawa said, speaking at the same conference.  Tasked by European Union treaties to maintain price stability in the euro zone, the ECB has fine-tuned its target in the past. It initially set its objective as an inflation rate  below 2 percent  in 1998 but five years later it changed it to  below, but close to 2 percent over the medium term .

The final rating is contingent upon the receipt of final documents conforming to information already received. A full list of ratings is available at the end of this commentary. KEY RATING DRIVERS High Share of Regulated Business: The ratings reflect the high share of regulated and fairly stable distribution business in Tauron's EBITDA (72% in 2016). This contributes to cash flow predictability at a time when conventional power generation, a key segment, is under pressure due to a challenging operating environment and limited fuel mix diversification with a high reliance on coal. Fitch expects the share of distribution at about 65% of EBITDA in 2017-2018, but it may slightly decrease in 2019 when the Jaworzno III 910 MW coal-fired power plant comes on stream to boost the performance of the weak generation segment. Despite allocating fairly high capex for conventional power generation by 2020, distribution continues to dominate Tauron's capex plan (53% of 2016-2020 capex), followed by generation (37%) and coal mining (7%). Strategy Drives Slower Leverage Increase: One of the key elements of Tauron's strategy update in September 2016 is the support of the financial profile through capex reduction by 11% to about PLN18 billion in the period from 2016 to 2020 (including the cancellation of the PLN1.5 billion gas-fired power plant project in Lagisza), cost reductions and asset optimisation. A key objective is to maintain leverage below the net debt/EBITDA covenant of 3.5x. Management said that the forecasts prepared for the strategy update indicate that no dividends will be paid until 2019. There were no dividend payments in 2016, compared with a PLN263 million dividend paid in 2015. We assume no dividends until 2019. Fitch views the capex programme as still significant despite the reduction in the strategy update. We project funds from operations (FFO)-adjusted net leverage to increase to about 3.4x in 2017-2018 from 3.1x in 2016, close to the maximum 3.5x for the ratings. As a result, Tauron has limited room for underperformance or additional capex or acquisitions. Financial Flexibility: In our view, Tauron retains some flexibility to reduce capex or implement other measures should cash flows be below expectations. For instance, it plans selling to an external investor up to a 50% stake in the Jaworzno III project and has recently signed the memorandum of understanding with two funds managed by Polish Development Fund PFR regarding investment of PLN880 million in the project. Capex in the distribution segment could also be deferred. Rated on a Standalone Basis: Tauron is 30.06% owned and effectively controlled by the Polish state (A-/Stable). However, Fitch rates it on a standalone basis because we assess legal, operational and strategic links with the state as moderate based on our Parent and Subsidiary Rating Linkage criteria. In our view, the links have had an incrementally stronger impact on the company under the new government since November 2015. Examples include the plan for no dividends until 2019. In our view, the Polish government's plans to introduce a capacity market are crucial in allowing coal power plants under construction, such as the Jaworzno III plant, to be profitable in the long term. We do not include any cash inflows related to the contemplated capacity market in our rating case forecast until 2020. DERIVATION SUMMARY Tauron's and Energa S.A.'s (BBB/Stable) business profiles benefit from the large share of regulated distribution in EBITDA, which provides good cash flow visibility at times when another key segment, conventional power generation, is under pressure. Two other Polish utilities, PGE Polska Grupa Energetyczna S.A. (BBB+/Stable), and ENEA S.A. (BBB/Stable) have lower share of regulated distribution than Tauron and Energa. Tauron, Energa and ENEA have limited headroom under their negative rating guidelines due to a projected increase in leverage in 2017-2018 driven by large capex. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: - Weighted average cost of capital in the distribution segment reduced to 5.7% in 2016 from 7.2% in 2015 (and 6.8% when applying the one-off haircut applied by the regulator), before gradually increasing to 6% in 2020. - 5% haircut reducing return on the distribution's regulated asset base incorporated from 2018. - Wholesale baseload power prices falling to about PLN155 per MWh by 2020. - Commencement of Jaworzno hard coal power block (0.9GW) and Stalowa Wola CCGT (50% of 0.4GW) in 2019-2020. - Capex of PLN18 billion for 2016-2020. - No dividends until 2019. RATING SENSITIVITIES Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action: - Continued focus on the distribution business in capex and overall strategy, together with FFO-adjusted net leverage below 2.5x on a sustained basis, supported by management's more conservative leverage target. - A more diversified fuel generation mix and lower CO2 emissions per MWh, which together with continued efficiency improvements, would result in a stronger business profile. However, the rating upside for Tauron is limited due to the company's business profile and projected increase in leverage due to capex. Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action: - FFO-adjusted net leverage above 3.5x and FFO fixed-charge cover below 5x on a sustained basis, for example, due to full implementation of capex and weaker-than-expected operating cash flows. - Acquisitions of stakes in coal mines or other form of support for state-owned mining companies under financial pressure leading to net leverage above 3.5x or substantially worsening Tauron's business profile. - Failure to maintain adequate liquidity. - A substantial tax payment arising from an increase in the nominal value of Tauron's shares. This is a cash flow and operating environment risk for Tauron and other Polish state-controlled utilities as the government contemplates an increase of the nominal value of their shares. Such an increase would be subject to approval at the shareholders meeting. This tax payment is not included in our assumptions for the rating case. Fitch treats this as event risk and a potential corporate governance issue. LIQUIDITY Sufficient liquidity: At end-March 2017 Tauron had PLN88 million of readily available cash and PLN3.4 billion of undrawn committed funding against short-term debt of PLN648 million and Fitch-expected negative free cash flow for 2017 of about PLN2 billion. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch rates Tauron as follows: --Long-Term Foreign and Local Currency IDRs at 'BBB'; Outlook Stable; --Short-Term Foreign and Local Currency IDRs at 'F3'; --Hybrid bonds at 'BB+'. --National Long-Term Rating at 'A+(pol)'; Outlook Stable; --National senior unsecured rating at 'A+(pol)'.

The European Commission announced the investigations on Wednesday but did not provide details of the sales practices.   Nike is aware of the European Commission's investigation and will continue to cooperate with the authorities,  the company said. Universal Studios and Sanrio did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The EU move follows a year-long inquiry by its competition authority into e-commerce practices by 1,900 companies, part of a broader strategy to boost online trade and economic growth. The inquiry found that some companies allow their products to be sold online only by pre-selected distributors, while others use pricing restrictions and even online sales bans to block certain sellers.  We are going to examine whether the licensing and distribution practices of these three companies may be denying consumers access to wider choice and better deals in the single market,  European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said in a statement. Nike is the license rights holder for Barcelona soccer club merchandise, while Sanrio owns the Hello Kitty brand, which adorn items ranging from stationery to clothing.  Universal Studios holds the rights for movies such as Minions and Despicable Me. The new investigations would cover similar issues to those of the e-commerce inquiry, but also include licensing of rights and offline distribution.  They complement the sector inquiry and other pending investigations in so far as they aim to tackle potential barriers to online and offline cross-border trade,  a Commission spokesman said, adding that the case had been brought by the EU executive rather than following a complaint. In February EU antitrust regulators opened three investigations into online sales of consumer electronics makers, video game makers and hotels. Last week the EU announced a probe into U.S. clothing company Guess's (GES.N) cross-border distribution deals. Companies can face fines of up to 10 percent of their global turnover if found guilty of breaking EU antitrust rules.

An overhaul of regulatory and implementing technical standards (RTS/ITS) for Article 9 of the European Markets Infrastructure Regulation aims to improve data clarity in OTC swaps reporting, which came into effect in February 2014. Updated Level III text was submitted by the European Securities and Markets Authority in late 2015 and adopted by the European Commission a year later.  There's no lack of clarity over what needs to be done but the industry is largely underprepared for the scale of the changes,  said Collin Coleman, head of NEX Regulatory Reporting, a transaction reporting platform that uses technology from Abide Financial, which was acquired by the NEX Group last October.  Simply looking at this as a technical change is the wrong way as the industry is going to have to report twice as many fields and almost 80% of the fields are new, or changed.  As part of the overhaul, derivatives counterparties will be required to make fundamental changes to database structures in order to manage an array of changes that include additional data on the type of trading model used in each transaction. Analysis by Abide shows that the rewrite comprises 51 new fields, 22 amended fields and seven deletions. A rush for compliance could have a knock-on effect for MiFID II preparations, Coleman said, with the sweeping requirements for pre and post-trade transparency across securities and derivatives markets set to go live on January 3.  Even in an organisation of moderate complexity, you've probably got five to 10 systems that need to be updated, so itâs a big upheaval and could have a significant impact on MiFID II preparations,  said Coleman. Already delayed by one year, regulators see no scope for extending the MiFID II deadline.  Contrary to some recent coverage and commentary, MiFID II/MiFIR will come into effect on January 3 2018, there will be no further delay in its implementation,  chair of the European Securities and Markets Authority Steven Maijoor said at the FIA's IDX conference in London last week.  One delay has been enough for all concerned.  EMIR reporting changes come into effect as European policymakers embark on a broader review of regulation that entered into force in 2012. As part of the EMIR review, published last month, the European Commission proposed a change to the controversial dual-sided reporting requirement that requires both parties on an transaction to report their trade to a registered repository. Under new recommendations - yet to be approved by the European Parliament and European Council - non-financial counterparties would cease to be subject to swaps reporting, instead handing responsibility over to their financial counterparties.  For small and medium-sized firms doing FX hedging, it's a very big lift to meet the changes to the RTS/ITS in November, particularly if the wider macro EMIR review leaves them out of scope altogether,  said Coleman. NEX Regulatory Reporting, which went live earlier this year, has around 135 buyside and sellside clients accessing its global regulatory reporting services.

According to the people, who attended a dinner between Temer and Brazilian state governors late on Tuesday, the Brazilian leader wished to find a solution as soon as possible to the mounting debt burden of regional governments.  A refinancing of 20 billion reais in BNDES debts is  just a step away  and may be ready by September thanks to legislation that facilitates such a deal. The remaining amount hinges on an executive decree, said the person, who requested anonymity to speak freely about the plan. A second person said a separate executive decree allowing states to bundle some of their debt with the National Treasury into securities, and sell them to investors, is being analyzed. Government and private-sector banks could participate in the process, the person said. Since taking office a year ago, Temer has offered states some debt relief without undermining his vow to narrow a record high budget deficit. Still, economists such as Insper professor Marcos Lisboa point to the risk of a watered-down austerity plan to drum up political support as Temer faces a corruption probe. Temer's office did not immediately comment. Several states have struggled to pay salaries for police and doctors and to keep hospitals stocked with medical supplies. Their finances have been squeezed by a steep decline in commodity prices, a prolonged recession and years of budget mismanagement.

Oslo was the first international airport hub to offer biofuels as part of the fuel mix it sells in 2016, followed by Los Angeles and Stockholm, as part of efforts to limit surging greenhouse gas emissions in the airline industry.  This is a tiny little drop (in fossil jet fuel use). But it is the first drop,  said Olav Mosvold Larsen of state-owned Avinor, which runs 45 airports in Norway. He said jet biofuels were twice the cost of conventional fuels. The jet fuel blend sold for planes in Oslo now has 0.2 percent biofuels in the test project, he told Reuters. So far, Avinor has bought 1.25 million liters (275,000 UK gallons) of biofuels. In recent months, Avinor has imported waste cooking oil, sold by AltAir in California from sources including fast food restaurants, he said, confirming a report in the Norwegian daily Aftenposten. Last year, Oslo's biofuels came from Spain. Some environmentalists say that shipping biofuels from California, via the Panama Canal, makes no sense.   This is madness,  said Truls Gulowsen of Greenpeace, saying that European laws should do more to promote local production of biofuels, such as from Nordic forests.  Waste cooking oil should be used in California,  he said. Larsen said there were net environmental benefits. The greenhouse gas emissions for shipping a liter of biofuel from California to Sweden, and then trucking it to Norway, were a fraction of those from burning a liter of conventional jet fuel. Aviation accounts for about two percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, equivalent to the emissions of a country such as Canada or Mexico, and is expanding fast, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency. Norway's parliament will debate on June 19 whether to oblige jet fuel sold in Norway to have one percent biofuels from 2019. That would be equivalent to about 11 million liters (2.4 million UK gallons) a year.    Scandinavian Airlines System [SASSA.UL] said the plans could push up costs unless matched by other nations.  Extra taxation is limiting our possibility to invest in biofuels and take steps for a sustainable future,  said spokesman Knut Morten Johansen.

The approvals of new GMO imports follow an agreement on protocols for shipments of U.S. beef to China that was also promised under the broader trade deal last month. The new GMO varieties are Dow AgroSciences' Enlist corn and Monsanto's Vistive Gold soybean, the Ministry of Agriculture said in a statement on Wednesday. China does not permit the planting of genetically modified food crops but does allow GMO imports, such as soybeans, for use in its animal feed industry. But getting a new GMO crop variety approved for import by China takes around six years, compared with under three in other major markets, forcing leading agrichemical players to restrict sales during China's review process. In May, Beijing promised to speed up the evaluations of eight U.S. varieties of GMO crops by the end of the month under a trade deal with the United States. Industry comments suggest Beijing could issue additional product approvals in coming months.  We are aware of the latest updates of the approval process and are encouraged by the fast progress that the Chinese government has made,  said a DuPont Pioneer spokeswoman.  We look forward to more products getting approval.  DuPont Pioneer is awaiting approval for an insect-tolerant corn while Dow AgroSciences' Enlist soybean is also pending approval. The agriculture ministry said it has also renewed import approvals for 14 other GMO varieties including Syngenta's MIR162 Agrisure Viptera corn, a Monsanto sugar beet and three Bayer rapeseed products. The approvals are for a three-year period lasting to 2020, the statement said.

Scottish party leader Ruth Davidson made this clear at a meeting with Conservative Prime Minister Theresa May, who lost her parliamentary majority in Britain's June 8 vote, a spokesman for the party said on Wednesday.  Fishing is something that Ruth has talked about specifically, we are simply emphasising that this is something of huge importance to us,  a spokesman said, when asked whether fishing constituted a  red line  in Davidson's wish list for Scotland within a new UK government. May is under pressure from factions within her party to change her stance on Brexit, having lost her majority just as talks with the EU are due to start. She has yet to reach a deal with Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), which has 10 seats. And Davidson, who spearheaded the campaign to win 13 Conservative seats in Scotland, has considerable influence. The EU's policy allows all European boats access to EU waters and fishing grounds, which it says allows fishermen to compete fairly. But that means that 60 percent of what would be Scottish fish is caught by other EU fishing nations, the Scottish Fisheries Federation says, arguing that the industry has been decimated by EU membership. Both the Conservatives and the Scottish National Party (SNP) campaigned in last week's election to withdraw from the EU's fishing policy. But seats in the northeast of Scotland - Moray, Gordon, Angus as well as Banff and Buchan including fishing port Peterhead - were all won by Conservatives, defeating the SNP. Davidson has called for a  more open  Brexit and has said she wants the Conservatives to listen to other parties because voters did not give them the strong mandate May sought. She wants more emphasis on the economy over immigration in the talks, according to people in her party. Britain as a whole voted to leave the EU in a referendum last June but most Scots wanted to stay in.  As we leave the European Union we must leave the Common Fisheries Policy and ensure a good deal for our fishing communities,  Davidson said last week. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has told May that a new more inclusive Brexit plan is urgently needed to protect the economy and bring people together.

The Fed is expected to raise interest rates for the second time this year later on Wednesday, but the signs of moderate consumer spending and retreating inflation pressures could worry policymakers who have previously viewed the softness as transitory.      The central bank is scheduled to release its decision at 2 p.m EDT (1800 GMT) at the conclusion of its two-day policy meeting. Fed Chair Janet Yellen is due to hold a news conference at 2:30 pm EDT (1830 GMT).     The Labor Department said its Consumer Price Index dipped 0.1 percent in May. The so-called core CPI, which strips out food and energy costs, increased 1.7 percent year-on-year, the smallest rise since May 2015.      In the 12 months through May, the CPI increased 1.9 percent, the smallest increase since last November. The Fed has a 2 percent inflation target and tracks an inflation measure which is currently at 1.5 percent.      In a separate report, the Commerce Department said retail sales fell 0.3 percent last month.      We think this effectively takes September off the table,  said Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rates strategy at BMO Capital Markets in New York, in reference to the impact of the data on the probability of a September Fed rate increase.      U.S. interest rates futures rose after the data, suggesting traders reduced their bets on a possible third Fed interest rate increase in 2017.     Benchmark 10-year Treasury yields and seven-year yields hit their lowest levels since Nov. 10 of 2.120 percent and 1.928 percent, respectively, while 30-year yields  hit their lowest since Nov. 9 of 2.791 percent and five-year yields hit their lowest since Nov. 17 of 1.689 percent.

Oslo was the first international airport hub to offer biofuels as part of the fuel mix it sells in 2016, followed by Los Angeles and Stockholm, as part of efforts to limit surging greenhouse gas emissions in the airline industry.  This is a tiny little drop (in fossil jet fuel use). But it is the first drop,  said Olav Mosvold Larsen of state-owned Avinor, which runs 45 airports in Norway. He said jet biofuels were twice the cost of conventional fuels. The jet fuel blend sold for planes in Oslo now has 0.2 percent biofuels in the test project, he told Reuters. So far, Avinor has bought 1.25 million liters (275,000 UK gallons) of biofuels. In recent months, Avinor has imported waste cooking oil, sold by AltAir in California from sources including fast food restaurants, he said, confirming a report in the Norwegian daily Aftenposten. Last year, Oslo's biofuels came from Spain. Some environmentalists say that shipping biofuels from California, via the Panama Canal, makes no sense.   This is madness,  said Truls Gulowsen of Greenpeace, saying that European laws should do more to promote local production of biofuels, such as from Nordic forests.  Waste cooking oil should be used in California,  he said. Larsen said there were net environmental benefits. The greenhouse gas emissions for shipping a liter of biofuel from California to Sweden, and then trucking it to Norway, were a fraction of those from burning a liter of conventional jet fuel. Aviation accounts for about two percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, equivalent to the emissions of a country such as Canada or Mexico, and is expanding fast, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency. Norway's parliament will debate on June 19 whether to oblige jet fuel sold in Norway to have one percent biofuels from 2019. That would be equivalent to about 11 million liters (2.4 million UK gallons) a year.    Scandinavian Airlines System [SASSA.UL] said the plans could push up costs unless matched by other nations.  Extra taxation is limiting our possibility to invest in biofuels and take steps for a sustainable future,  said spokesman Knut Morten Johansen.

Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Bahrain and Egypt cut diplomatic and transport ties with Qatar a week ago, accusing it of fomenting regional unrest, supporting terrorism and getting too close to Iran, all of which Doha denies. State-owned Qatar Airways and other Qatari-owned aircraft are blocked from using the airspace over the four Arab countries.  Qatar Airways has said it will continue with plans to add 24 destinations between 2017 and 2018, including two in the next month, despite the restrictions that have forced the airline to fly longer routes to avoid the blocked airspace.  As far as we are concerned, it is business as usual,â al-Baker said.

U.S. retail sales in May recorded their biggest drop in 16 months and consumer prices unexpectedly fell month over month, suggesting inflation pressures are moderating, which could impact further Federal Reserve interest rate increases this year. The euro rose to its highest since Nov. 9 against the dollar, hitting $1.1295. Against the yen, the greenback fell by more than 1 percent following the data release to touch 108.95 yen, its lowest since April 21.  The numbers cast serious, serious doubt on whether there will be another hike this year,  said Greg Anderson, global head of foreign exchange strategy at BMO Capital Markets in New York. The dollar index was last down 0.6 percent at 96.437, after earlier touching its lowest since Nov. 9 at 96.323. Investors were still expecting the Federal Open Markets Committee to increase U.S. overnight interest rates later on Wednesday at the conclusion of its June policy meeting. Fed funds futures prices showed traders saw a more than 95 percent chance of a rates rise to between 1.00 and 1.25 percent. The likelihood of a rate hike in September has significantly weakened, however, with futures rates showing just a 17 percent chance of an increase, down from 28 percent before the data release on Wednesday, according to CME Group's FedWatch.  It won't stop the Fed from hiking interest rates later today, but it increases the downside risks to our forecast that there will be a further two rate hikes in the second half of this year,  said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics in Toronto. The Australian dollar rose 1.3 percent to its highest against its U.S. counterpart since April 3. New Zealand's dollar rose 1.25 percent to its highest since Feb. 7. The Canadian dollar rose 0.45 percent, hitting its highest against the U.S. dollar since Feb. 27. The loonie was on pace for its best week since January 2016, up 2.5 percent since Friday. Worries about global growth and weakness in markets for the commodities they produce has weighed on commodity-linked currencies like the Aussie, kiwi and loonie. But after comments by Bank of Canada Deputy Governor Carolyn Wilkins on Monday flipped markets towards an earlier rise in borrowing rates there, traders and analysts said short bets against commodity-linked currencies looked exposed.

If Wednesday's Cycling Independent Review (CIR) lacks the definitive answer, it shines a harsh spotlight on the sport's murkiest corners, where riders and back-up staff cowered in fear of challenging the authorities. Riders were issued with fierce admonishments for perceived failings and discouraged from developing interests outside cycling; staff were denied any form of personal development, and UK Sport, the government funding agency, looked the other way while more athletes stepped up to the winning podium. The report is damning, indicating that all proper workplace practice was sacrificed to the drive for more medals and, as a direct consequence, further funding. Although the culture was unchallenged for years, the CIR makes clear that alarm bells sounded long ago. One member of the World Class Programme (WCP) -- or  medal factory  as it has been labelled -- dated the problems to Beijing 2008 when eight Olympic gold medals delivered a cultural shift from success being an aspiration to a requirement. Shane Sutton's subsequent removal from the team management for allegedly unacceptable behaviour led to a dip in results. But with his return as head coach, and with the advent of Team Sky to work side-by-side with the WCP in 2009, normal medal service was resumed. The link seemed clear and the Australian's position became untouchable. The review suggests the WCP went from being  coach-led, athlete-centred  to  coach-led, coach-centred  with the divisive figure of  old-school  Sutton at its heart. While his drive and dedication were widely admired, Sutton's colourful language was not, with women riders referred to as  Sheilahs  or worse and BMX riders sidelined. A secret post-2012 British Cycling report highlighted difficulties despite the record 12-medal London haul.  The personal situation regarding interpersonal relationships/behaviours was untenable  and needed urgent address, it said. Yet nothing was done and UK Sport received only a summary of the report, not its full findings. Morale plummeted and, with Dave Brailsford's departure as British Cycling's performance director in 2014, Sutton was appointed technical director, a role to which most believed he was totally unsuited.  SS did not operate in a way which was always appropriate for a modern work place, even if highly pressurised and at the pinnacle of international sporting competition,  the report found.  Furthermore, SS should not have been placed into a leading management position within the WCP without appropriate support, guidance and training also being put in place for him.  Bullying Claims Staff felt there was no point raising grievances because human resources  were complicit with Shane . Eventually, the dropping of former World Championships medallist Jess Varnish from the WCP after her failure to qualify for the 2016 Olympics in Rio blew everything apart. Regarded as a  trouble-maker  and  ring-leader  by some who testified to the panel, Varnish went public with allegations of sexism and bullying, and the whole sorry tale began to emerge. Yet the panel is clear on who should bear the real responsibility.  Culture starts at the top of any organisation,  it said, a finding that British Cycling and UK Sport have been quick to accept As the dust settles, British sport could face more problems ahead, with threats of legal action in cycling and accusations of racism and bullying now surfacing in other sports, like bobsleigh and swimming. It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that Britain's recent Olympic success has come at a heavy price.

That represented a doubling from the 2015 tally but electric cars still only accounted for 0.2 percent of the global count. How many will there be in five years' time? Or in 10 years' time? The answer to that question will determine the fortunes of multiple metals over the coming years. Battery materials such as lithium and cobalt are already bubbling as supply chains which have historically evolved to meet niche applications adapt to the much bigger demands of the green technology revolution. The likes of aluminium and copper can be expected to continue benefiting from greater usage across a transport sector increasingly defined by lightweighting and enhanced electrical circuitry. Platinum and palladium, by contrast, could be losers as electrification reduces the need for catalytic converters. But both supply and price are going to depend on what happens to demand. And that is the electric elephant in the room. Tearing Down the Bolt Analysts at Swiss bank UBS attempted to answer the question by tearing apart piece by piece a Chevy Bolt, which must top the list of fun things to do if you're a bank researcher. They chose the Bolt because it is the first mass-market electric vehicle with a range of over 200 miles. It also  has a price tag and range similar to the upcoming Tesla Model 3, which is Tesla's long-awaited entry into the mass market.  ( UBS Evidence Lab Electric Car Teardown - Disruption Ahead? , May 18, 2017). Their surprise finding is that the Bolt's powertrain was $4,600 cheaper to produce than they expected  with more cost reduction potential left.  Their key takeaway is that the Bolt could reach consumer cost of ownership parity with a comparable internal combustion engine vehicle such as the Volkswagen Golf much sooner than expected, as early as next year in Europe. That would represent a tipping point for demand and UBS has lifted its electric vehicle (EV) sales projections by around 50 percent accordingly.  We now forecast 3.1m EVs sold in 2021 (battery-electric cars and plug-in hybrids) and 14.2m sold in 2025, instead of 2.5m and 9.7m previously.  Electric vehicles' share of new sales is forecast to rise from that marginal 0.2 percent last year to three percent in 2021 and 14 percent in 2025. Double Revolution And if those numbers look a bit on the aggressive side, UBS' forecasts look decidedly pedestrian relative to those of RethinkX, a thinktank founded by Stanford University's Tony Seba.  Rethinking Transportation 2020-2030 , also released last month, generated a flurry of headlines about the imminent demise of the combustion engine.  We are on the cusp of one of the fastest, deepest, most consequential disruptions of transportation in history,  the report warns. One which  will have enormous implications across the transportation and oil industries, decimating entire portions of their value chains, causing oil demand and prices to plummet, and destroying trillions of dollars in investor value.  Phew! RethinkX' core argument is that there is not one but two technical revolutions under way in the automotive sector. Electrification of the global car fleet will coincide with the roll-out of autonomous vehicle technology with both trends feeding off each other.  By 2030, within 10 years of regulatory approval of autonomous vehicles (AVs), 95 percent of U.S. passenger miles traveled will be served by on-demand autonomous electric vehicles owned by fleets, not individuals, in a new business model we call 'transport-as-a-service' . Consumer Choice or Government Mandate? It's an extreme vision but one that serves to underline the diversity of views as to what to expect over the coming decade. In truth, there is no consensus whatsoever as to how fast electrification, or indeed automation, of the global vehicle fleet will happen. There are simply too many moving parts to the equation, far more than the 24 the UBS team found in the Bolt's powertrain. UBS' research aims to tackle the problem from a consumer choice model. When does the cost and convenience of owning an electric vehicle outweigh the advantages still enjoyed by existing internal combustion engine vehicles? But in many parts of the world, consumer choice will be directly affected by government edict. California led the way with its 2012 mandate that automakers selling more than 600,000 vehicles a year in the state must sell a stipulated amount of zero-emission-vehicles or risk losing the right to sell any at all. China, which has its own problems with smog, is now picking up the compliance baton. Its proposed system, currently at the draft legislation stage, is much tougher. Nor has Beijing shown any signs of giving in to automaker pressure to push the start back from 2018. There are multiple similar national and city initiatives. London, for example, has stipulated that all new black cabs will have to be partly electric-powered by January next year. Electrification of the 24,000-strong taxi fleet will go hand in hand with higher charges on diesel cars entering the city later this year. So fast are these changes happening that the city's local and transport authorities are now racing against the clock to install the charging infrastructure necessary to support an all-electric cab fleet. It's the interaction of consumer choice and government coercion that makes projecting EV growth rates so difficult. Volatility Ahead Metals such as cobalt and lithium find themselves on the front-line of this green transport revolution because of their core role in batteries. Explosive price hikes last year in lithium and earlier this year in cobalt were prime examples of what happens when supply chains are too slow to react to new demand drivers. The initial lithium price shock seems to be fading as existing producers ramp up capacity and new operators enter the marketplace. Cobalt, as traded on the London Metal Exchange, rocketed from $32,750 per tonne at the start of January to $56,250 in early April and has since also shown signs of flattening out at a current $56,500. In both cases the initial price shock has passed. But there is the potential for more price volatility going forward because producers, traders and analysts alike are struggling to construct consensus demand models. That's the problem with revolutions. Once they start they evolve in wholly unpredictable ways. The great technological jump of vehicle electrification is going to lead to some equally big moves in price. Up? Down? Probably both.

About 200 million migrants, half of whom are women, sent $445 billion to their families in Asia, Latin America and Africa in 2016, the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) said on Wednesday.  The total amount of remittances, which is estimated to reach $450 billion in 2017, has risen by more than 50 percent in the past decade, IFAD said.  It is a truly a global phenomenon in which people, due to lack of opportunities, have to leave their families behind to provide for them,  said Pedro De Vasconcelos,Â IFAD policy advisor and author of the report.  Migration should be an option, a choice. But for 200 million people, it's a necessity,  he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in a phone interview. Most remittances ($117 billion) came from the United States,  followed by Europe ($115 billion) and the Gulf states ($100 billion). Total migrant worker earnings are estimated to be $3 trillion annually, of which approximately 85 percent remains in the host countries. The money migrants send home averages less than one percent of their host country's gross domestic product, IFAD said. The report said families back home receive an average of $200 a month, which makes up 60 percent of the household income.  Using the steady flow of remittances, families can buy food, get housing, go to school, access healthcare, improve sanitation, or even invest in a business and have some savings, the report said. De Vasconcelos said relying on remittances is a symptom of poverty in developing nations that pushes people to find economic opportunities abroad. He said helping families use the money more productively could help reduce poverty, and in turn, prevent people from migrating in the first place.  Remittances are a symptom, but (they) ... can be used to have a long-term positive effect in the economies where these funds are going,  he said. Ways to maximise remittances include getting private companies to reduce money transfer fees to poor remote areas, providing financial literacy to families, or promoting climate insurance to those in rural areas so they can cope better with disasters like floods, cyclones or droughts, the report said.

In 2014, Social Democrat (SPD) Sigmar Gabriel, then economy minister and now foreign minister, introduced tighter controls on arms exports to conflict zones in particular, but in 2016 the three biggest buyers were Qatar, Algeria and South Korea. Three months before an election, the economy ministry's annual arms report showed conservative Chancellor Angela Merkel's cabinet approved 6.85 billion euros ($7.7 billion) of military equipment exports, including weapons, overall in 2016. That was about 1 billion euros lower than last year in all but weapons exports, which can lag order approvals by years, were up 1 billion from 2015. More than half of the 2.5 billion of sales were to non-EU or non-NATO countries.  The 'Made in Germany' death business is booming,  the head of the pacifist opposition Left party, Katja Kipping, said. More than 70 years after World War Two, Germany is reluctant to send troops on foreign missions but has long encouraged military exports and has been ranked the world's fifth biggest major arms exporter by the SIPRI research institute. The industry employs about 80,000 people. A ministry spokesman pointed to the fall in order approvals for arms overall, including communications equipment, protection vehicles and mine clearing kit, and to a roughly 1 billion euro drop in approvals for equipment orders in 2016 to 1.88 billion. In the first four months of this year, the government approved 2.42 billion euros of military equipment orders, down from 3.3 billion in the same period last year. Germany's Heckler and Koch, one of the world's best-known gun makers whose G36 is standard issue for armies across the globe, has blamed restrictions on exports to the Middle East for a sharp fall in operating earnings. But opposition parties stepped up calls for a ban on weapons sales to dictatorships or states with a history of rights abuse.  Exports are increasing rather than falling. Promises have not been kept. As economy minister, Gabriel fuelled crises with this policy that he's now having to sort out as foreign minister,  Greens political director Michael Kellner said.

The impoverished West African country is a way station for migrants heading to Europe and some experts believe that more African migrants die in the Sahara than at sea. Soldiers rescued 25 migrants on Wednesday morning near a well in northern Niger, the local prefect, Fatoumi Goudou, said. It was not immediately clear what their nationalities were. Another 92 migrants, most of them Nigerian, were rescued on Friday by a team from the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and Niger Republic soldiers, GiuseppeÂ Loprete, head of the IOM mission in Niger, told Reuters.  One of those migrants died shortly after arriving at an IOM facility in the northeastern town of Dirkou, Loprete said. The rest will soon be transferred to Agadez in central Niger before eventually being repatriated to their countries of origin. European countries have promised Niger tens of millions of dollars to combat people smuggling and the IOM said in April that the number of migrants crossing Niger to reach Libya has declined since last year, largely due to a government crackdown. Even so, many continue to take the risk. More than 40 migrants died of thirst in northern Niger this month after their truck broke down.

He (Zuma) has indicated that he is not opposed to the establishment of a commission of inquiry and as we speak now, he is in the process of consulting his legal advisers to find ways of giving effect to this proposal,  Ramaphosa told parliament on Wednesday. The recent leak of a tranche of emails from the Gupta brothers, rich Indian businessmen who are friends of Zuma and whose business empire is central to allegations of state capture, has rocked the ruling African National Congress. The party is due to hold a conference in December to elect a new leader. Zuma, who has steadfastly denied any impropriety in his relationship with the Gupta family, has survived several calls from party insiders to step down before his term as state president ends in 2019.

According to the people, who attended a dinner between Temer and Brazilian state governors late on Tuesday, the Brazilian leader wished to find a solution as soon as possible to the mounting debt burden of regional governments.  A refinancing of 20 billion reais in BNDES debts is  just a step away  and may be ready by September thanks to legislation that facilitates such a deal. The remaining amount hinges on an executive decree, said the person, who requested anonymity to speak freely about the plan. A second person said a separate executive decree allowing states to bundle some of their debt with the National Treasury into securities, and sell them to investors, is being analyzed. Government and private-sector banks could participate in the process, the person said. Since taking office a year ago, Temer has offered states some debt relief without undermining his vow to narrow a record high budget deficit. Still, economists such as Insper professor Marcos Lisboa point to the risk of a watered-down austerity plan to drum up political support as Temer faces a corruption probe. Temer's office did not immediately comment. Several states have struggled to pay salaries for police and doctors and to keep hospitals stocked with medical supplies.

Traders gathered for a minute's silence in honor of the victims of the June 3 attack, before fruit-and-veg stallholder Paul Wheeler rang the market bell, crying as he tugged the rope harder and harder.  I was only supposed to ring it once, but once I started I couldn't stop. I just wanted to get the market back open,  he told Reuters moments later, still visibly emotional.  It's been really hard. Business-wise, we suffered, but emotionally, all of us here have been struggling with it. I'm just glad we're back open,  he said.

Strong and together, London is open. Borough Market is open,  Hyslop said. A warren of alleyways and streets nestled under a railway bridge and by the side of the medieval Southwark Cathedral, Borough Market is a foodie's paradise, with stalls selling a variety of specialties from around Britain and the world. It is also a vibrant spot for socializing, with the surrounding streets full of pubs, bars, cafes and restaurants that were packed with people enjoying a balmy Saturday night out when the three attackers struck. They drove a van into pedestrians on nearby London Bridge, killing three.

Warmbier, 22, a University of Virginia student from suburban Cincinnati, arrived in the United States on Tuesday evening, witnesses said.  His release came after Joseph Yun, the U.S. State Department's special envoy on North Korea, traveled to Pyongyang and demanded Warmbier's release on  humanitarian grounds,  capping a flurry of secret diplomatic contacts, a U.S. official said. Warmbier's parents, Fred and Cindy, confirmed their son was on a medevac flight.   Sadly, he is in a coma and we have been told he has been in that condition since March of 2016,  the parents said in a statement.  We learned of this only one week ago. We want the world to know how we and our son have been brutalized and terrorized by the pariah regime in North Korea.  Warmbier was detained in January 2016 and sentenced to 15 years of hard labor in March last year for trying to steal an item with a propaganda slogan, according to North Korean media. Warmbier's plane landed at Cincinnati Municipal Lunken Airport at around 10.15 p.m. local time (0215 GMT), according to a Reuters witness. Medical personnel carried a male, believed to be Warmbier and wearing a blue shirt and dark blue pants, off the plane without the use of a stretcher. The person carried from the plane did not appear to be moving independently, the Reuters witness said. A small group of family friends was nearby to celebrate Warmbier's arrival, cheering and holding signs that read  Pray for Otto  and  Welcome home Otto.  The man was loaded into an ambulance bound for the University of Cincinnati Medical Center, where a hospital spokeswoman said he would receive treatment. Warmbier's family said they were told by North Korean officials, through contacts with American envoys, that Warmbier fell ill from botulism some time after his March 2016 trial and lapsed into a coma after taking a sleeping pill, the Washington Post reported. The New York Times quoted a senior U.S. official as saying Washington recently received intelligence reports that Warmbier had been repeatedly beaten in custody.

Big Priority Warmbier's release came as former U.S. basketball star Dennis Rodman arrived in North Korea on Tuesday, returning to the nuclear-armed country where he met leader Kim Jong Un on previous visits. The State Department denied any connection between Warmbier's release and Rodman's visit, which President Donald Trump's administration said it did not authorize. Slideshow (10 Images)The State Department is continuing to discuss three other detained Americans with North Korea, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said. Since taking office in January, Trump has faced a growing national security challenge from North Korea, which has conducted a series of ballistic missile tests in defiance of U.S. and international sanctions. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters on Air Force One that  bringing Otto home was a big priority for the president.  In rare high-level contacts, Yun met senior North Korean officials in Oslo in May, where it was agreed Swedish officials in Pyongyang, who handle U.S. consular affairs there, would be allowed to see all four American detainees, a State Department official said. The North Koreans later urgently requested another meeting in New York. Yun met North Korea's ambassador to the United Nations on June 6 and was told about Warmbier's condition, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Tillerson consulted with Trump and arrangements were made for Yun and a medical team to travel to Pyongyang, the official said. Yun arrived on Monday, visited Warmbier with two doctors and demanded his release, the official said. The North Koreans agreed and he was flown out on Tuesday.  In no uncertain terms North Korea must explain the causes of his coma,  veteran former diplomat Bill Richardson said in a statement after speaking to Warmbier's parents. Richardson has played a role in past negotiations with North Korea.

Nowak also told Reuters that benchmark bond issues denominated in dollars or euros were unlikely before the fourth quarter.  Taking into account the very good liquidity situation of the state budget and the significantly larger-than-expected payment from the central bank profit (to the budget), in July and August one may expect a 'holiday' supply (of bonds),  Nowak said.  Due to the very good liquidity situation, one should not expect benchmark foreign issues before the fourth quarter,  he also said. Nowak said that the ministry currently had liquid funds worth over 76 billion zlotys ($20.31 billion) on its budgetary accounts at the end of May, equivalent to 4 percent of Polish gross domestic product. The ministry said earlier that total tax revenue had increased at an annual rate of 21 percent in the first four months of 2017, helped by robust economic growth and government efforts to increase tax collection. The improved budget performance has helped bring down Poland's 10-year bond yield, which has fallen by nearly 70 basis points to 3.16 percent since the end of January. Nowak also said that the ministry is monitoring markets to expand or diversify its investors' base.  This is achieved by issues such as those of Panda bonds or green bonds,  he said - bonds denominated in Chinese yuan and those that finance project with environmental benefits, respectively. Poland became the first European government to sell debt denominated in yuan on China's interbank bond market in August last year. In December, Poland also became the first sovereign globally to issue green bonds.   Investors' interest is very high, so we would like to regularly - more or less once in a year - offer green bonds on foreign markets,  he said, adding the value of these issues will demand on budget needs for financing of green projects.

The ratio of debt to disposable income edged down to 166.9 percent from an adjusted 167.2 percent in the fourth quarter. That meant Canadians owed C$1.67 for every dollar of disposable income. The Bank of Canada - which warns borrowers that interest rates will one day move up from near record lows - last week said rising consumer debt levels and an unbalanced housing market had raised household vulnerabilities. Separately, data showed Canadian home prices rose in May as Toronto remained robust despite recent government efforts to cool the market, while prices in Vancouver picked back up to hit a fresh peak. Policy makers are worried about a possible bubble in both cities. Years of low rates since the global financial crisis, as well as rising home prices, have prompted Canadians to steadily increase their debt. RBC Economics economist Laura Cooper said the slight dip in the household debt ratio reflected a  seasonal slowing in debt accumulation in the quarter rather than an improvement in household balances . The Teranet-National Bank Composite House Price Index, which measures changes for repeat sales of single-family homes, showed prices rose 2.2 percent last month. While other recent data suggested activity in the Toronto market cooled in May, Wednesday's report pointed to accelerating price growth in the resale market. Low rates allow consumers to pay down more of their mortgage principal. At the end of the first quarter, households spent more on principal payments than on interest payments for the first time since Statscan began compiling the data in 1990. On a seasonally adjusted basis, households borrowed C$27.5 billion ($20.8 billion) in the first quarter, down from C$27.6 billion in the previous quarter. Mortgages made up C$20.9 billion of this, an increase of C$2.7 billion, while consumer credit and non-mortgage loans fell C$2.8 billion to C$6.5 billion. Consumers' ability to pay their debt also remained relatively easy. The interest-only debt service ratio held at a record low of 6.1 percent, while the household savings rate fell to 4.3 percent from 5.3 percent. The household debt service ratio, with is obligated payments of both principal and interest as a proportion of disposable income, edged up to 14.2 percent from 14.1 percent in the fourth quarter. $1=$1.32 Canadian Reporting by David Ljunggren; Editing by Bernard Orr","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/canada-economy-idUSL1N1JB0CY"},

About 200 million migrants, half of whom are women, sent $445 billion to their families in Asia, Latin America and Africa in 2016, the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) said on Wednesday.  The total amount of remittances, which is estimated to reach $450 billion in 2017, has risen by more than 50 percent in the past decade, IFAD said.  It is a truly a global phenomenon in which people, due to lack of opportunities, have to leave their families behind to provide for them,  said Pedro De Vasconcelos,Â IFAD policy advisor and author of the report.  Migration should be an option, a choice. But for 200 million people, it's a necessity,  he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in a phone interview. Most remittances ($117 billion) came from the United States,  followed by Europe ($115 billion) and the Gulf states ($100 billion). Total migrant worker earnings are estimated to be $3 trillion annually, of which approximately 85 percent remains in the host countries. The money migrants send home averages less than one percent of their host country's gross domestic product, IFAD said. The report said families back home receive an average of $200 a month, which makes up 60 percent of the household income.  Using the steady flow of remittances, families can buy food, get housing, go to school, access healthcare, improve sanitation, or even invest in a business and have some savings, the report said. De Vasconcelos said relying on remittances is a symptom of poverty in developing nations that pushes people to find economic opportunities abroad. He said helping families use the money more productively could help reduce poverty, and in turn, prevent people from migrating in the first place.  Remittances are a symptom, but (they) ... can be used to have a long-term positive effect in the economies where these funds are going,  he said. Ways to maximise remittances include getting private companies to reduce money transfer fees to poor remote areas, providing financial literacy to families, or promoting climate insurance to those in rural areas so they can cope better with disasters like floods, cyclones or droughts, the report said.

Up to now BHRT has been funded with license fees added to monthly phone bills but payments have been stalled by bickering among Bosniak Muslims, Serbs and Croats in the Sarajevo parliament. An interim, six-month financing measure approved by parliament expires on June 30. The rights watchdog Council of Europe has warned that BHRT's demise would be a further grave setback to efforts to rebuild a cohesive state after Bosnia's 1992-95 ethnic war, which left the country split into autonomous Serb and Bosniak-Croat entities with a weak tripartite presidency in Sarajevo.  All alarm bells are ringing,  BHRT General Manager Belmin Karamehmedovic, a Bosniak, said in a last-ditch appeal to the authorities to enable the broadcaster to continue operating.  At the moment, we don't have any model of financing. We need quick solutions to survive. It's literally a matter of days.  Any collapse of BHRT would also set back the Balkan country's prospects of accession to the European Union.  The idea of a future member state of the European Union without public service media is unthinkable,  said European Parliament deputy Cristian Dan Preda, referring to Bosnia's ambition to obtain EU candidate status by the end of 2017.  This is a dramatic situation for Bosnia,  Patrick Pennincks of the Council of Europe said.  It is of key and utmost importance that the solution is found.  Bosnia's public broadcasting system was created from scratch with international help after the 1990s war with the goal of combining three separate wartime ethnic broadcasters and discourage inflammatory nationalist rhetoric. Its funding model functioned for years but the rise of cable providers and mobile telephony has decimated fee collections, burdening BHRT with 16 million euros in debt to the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), contractors and employees. Outdated media laws that regulated BHRT's operation and financing need to be reformed but Croat and Serb lawmakers in the Sarajevo parliament have blocked them. Croat MPs make reforms conditional on the formation of a Croat television channel, while Serb deputies reject them as a threat to Serb regional autonomy. The Serb and Croat stances are seen by analysts see as geared to reshaping broadcasting along ethnic nationalist lines.

The premium investors demand for holding 10-year Italian government debt over top-rated German Bunds has narrowed 34 basis points in the past week to around 169 bps, reflecting a similar slide in Italian yields. (reut.rs/2rv2UP5) Just a week ago, the spread was above 200 bps -- its widest in seven weeks. The move has turned 2017 bond returns in the euro zone's third biggest economy positive for the first time. (reut.rs/2srLkR1) The gap between Italian and German bond yields is seen as a gauge of investor concern over political and other risks in the euro zone. The focus of attention earlier this year was whether a rise in populism could see the bloc break up. No coincidence then that the sharpest tightening in spreads since mid-2013 followed an easing of worries that Italy could face early elections and reduced euro zone break-up risks after the election of centrist Emmanuel Macron as French president. A severe setback for Italy's eurosceptic 5-Star Movement in local elections at the weekend was the latest signal that the populist wave that worried investors looking ahead to 2017 was losing steam.  The reality is that the market got itself positioned with a short view on Italy given the possibility of early elections in the third quarter,  said Iain Stealey, who manages JPMorgan Asset Management's Global Bond Opportunities Fund.  What you see now is a combination of that position unwinding and the realisation that if we don't get an election for a while, you get another 172 bps on top of German bonds and a yield of close to 2 percent.  Such steep falls in euro zone yields are rare - the last time was after Britain voted last June to leave the European Union. The uncertainty that followed was seen encouraging central banks to keep monetary policy loose, crushing yields. The slide in Italian yields also follows signals from the European Central Bank that it is no rush to take away monetary stimulus that has helped weaker euro zone economies and signs of progress in fixing a frail banking sector. Italy is close to agreeing with the European Commission a deal to rescue two ailing regional banks while limiting losses for investors, the country's economy minister said on Tuesday.

Islamic State fighters are close to defeat in the twin capitals of the group's territory, Mosul in Iraq and Raqqa in Syria, and officials say Baghdadi is steering clear of both, hiding in thousands of square miles of desert between the two.  In the end, he will either be killed or captured, he will not be able to remain underground forever,  said Lahur Talabany, the head of counter-terrorism at the Kurdistan Regional Government, the Kurdish autonomous region in northern Iraq.  But this is a few years away still,  he told Reuters. One of Baghdadi's main concerns is to ensure those around him do not betray him for the $25 million reward offered by the United States to bring him  to justice , said Hisham al-Hashimi, who advises Middle East governments on Islamic State affairs.  With no land to rule openly, he can no longer claim the title caliph,  Hashimi said.  He is a man on the run and the number of his supporters is shrinking as they lose territory.  Iraqi forces have retaken much of Mosul, the northern Iraqi city the hardline group seized in June 2014 and from which Baghdadi declared himself  caliph  or leader of all Muslims shortly afterwards. Raqqa, his capital in Syria, is nearly surrounded by a coalition of Syrian Kurdish and Arab groups. The last public video footage of him shows him dressed in black clerical robes declaring his caliphate from the pulpit of Mosul's medieval Grand al-Nuri mosque back in 2014. Born Ibrahim al-Samarrai, Baghdadi is a 46-year-old Iraqi who broke away from al-Qaeda in 2013, two years after the capture and killing of the group's leader Osama bin Laden. He grew up in a religious family, studied Islamic Theology in Baghdad and joined the Salaafi jihadist insurgency in 2003, the year of the US-led invasion of Iraq. He was caught by the Americans who released him about a year later as they considered him then as a civilian rather than a military target. Bounty He is shy and reserved, Hashimi said, and has recently stuck to the sparsely populated Iraq-Syria border where drones and strangers are easy to spot. The U.S. Department of State's Counter-Terrorism Rewards Program had put the same $25 million bounty on Bin Laden and Iraqi former president Saddam Hussein and the reward is still available for Bin Laden's successor, Ayman al-Zawahiri. Neither Saddam nor Bin Laden were voluntarily betrayed, but the bounties complicated their movements and communications.  The reward creates worry and tension, it restricts his movements and limit the number of his guards,  said Fadhel Abu Ragheef, a Baghdad-based expert on extremist groups.  He doesn't stay more than 72 hours in any one place.  Baghdadi  has become nervous and very careful in his movements , said Talabany, whose services are directly involved in countering Islamic State plots.  His circle of trust has become even smaller.  His last recorded speech was issued in early November, two weeks after the start of the Mosul battle, when he urged his followers to fight the  unbelievers  and  make their blood flow as rivers . U.S. and Iraqi officials believe he has left operational commanders behind with diehard followers to fight the battles of Mosul and Raqqa, to focus on his own survival. A man purported to be the reclusive leader of the militant Islamic State Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi making what would have been his first public appearance, at a mosque in the centre of Iraq's second city, Mosul, according to a video recording posted on the Internet on July 5, 2014, in this still image taken from video.Social Media Website via Reuters TV/File PhotoIt is not possible to confirm his whereabouts. Baghdadi does not use phones and has a handful of approved couriers to communicate with his two main aides, Iyad al-Obaidi, his defence minister, and Ayad al-Jumaili, in charge of security. There was no confirmation of an April 1 Iraqi state TV report that Jumaili had been killed.   Baghdadi moves in ordinary cars, or the kind of pick-up trucks used by farmers, between hideouts on both sides of the Iraqi-Syrian border, with just a driver and two bodyguards, said Hashimi. The region is well known to his men as the hotbed of the Sunni insurgency against U.S. forces that invaded Iraq and later the Shi'ite-led governments that took over the country. At the height of its power two years ago, Islamic State ruled over millions of people in territory running from northern Syria through towns and villages along the Tigris and Euphrates river valleys to the outskirts of the Iraqi capital Baghdad. It persecuted non-Sunnis and even Sunnis who did not agree with its extreme version of Islamic law, with public executions and whippings for violating strict controls on appearance, behaviour and movement. But the group has been retreating since in the face of a multitude of local, regional and international forces, driven into action by the scores of deadly attacks around the world that it has claimed or inspired. A few hundred thousand people now live in the areas under the group's control, in and around Raqqa and Deir al-Zor, in Syria's east, and in a few pockets south and west of Mosul. Hashimi said Islamic State was moving some fighters out of Raqqa before it was encircled to regroup in Deir al-Zor. Mosul, with pre-war population of 2 million, was at least four times the size of any other the group has held. Up to 200,000 people are still trapped in the Old City, Islamic State's besieged enclave in Mosul, lacking supplies and being used as human shields to obstruct the progress of Iraqi forces by a U.S-led international coalition. The Syrian Democratic Forces, made of Kurdish and Arab groups supported by the U.S.-led coalition, began to attack Raqqa last week, after a months-long campaign to cut it off. The militants are also fighting Russian and Iranian-backed forces in Syria loyal to President Bashar al-Assad, and mainly Sunni Muslim Syrian rebels backed by Turkey. The last official report about Baghdadi was from the Iraqi military on Feb. 13. Iraqi F-16s carried out a strike on a house where he was thought to be meeting other commanders, in western Iraq, near the Syrian border, it said. Overall, Islamic State has 8,000 fighters left, of which 2,000 are foreigners from other Arab states, Europe, Russia and central Asia, said Abu Ragheef.  A small number compared to the tens of thousands arrayed against them in both countries, but a force to be reckoned with, made up of die-hards with nothing to lose, hiding in the middle of civilians and making extensive use of booby traps, mines and explosives,  he said.     The U.S. government has a joint task force to track down Baghdadi which includes special operations forces, the CIA and other U.S. intelligence agencies as well as spy satellites of the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency. It will take more than that to erase his influence, Talabany said.  He is still considered the leader of ISIL and many continue to fight for him; that hasn't changed drastically,  he said, using one of Islamic State's acronyms.

The premium investors demand for holding 10-year Italian government debt over top-rated German Bunds has narrowed 34 basis points in the past week to around 169 bps, reflecting a similar slide in Italian yields. Just a week ago, the spread was above 200 bps -- its widest in seven weeks. The move has turned 2017 bond returns in the euro zone's third biggest economy positive for the first time. The gap between Italian and German bond yields is seen as a gauge of investor concern over political and other risks in the euro zone. The focus of attention earlier this year was whether a rise in populism could see the bloc break up. No coincidence then that the sharpest tightening in spreads since mid-2013 followed an easing of worries that Italy could face early elections and reduced euro zone break-up risks after the election of centrist Emmanuel Macron as French president. A severe setback for Italy's eurosceptic 5-Star Movement in local elections at the weekend was the latest signal that the populist wave that worried investors looking ahead to 2017 was losing steam.  The reality is that the market got itself positioned with a short view on Italy given the possibility of early elections in the third quarter,  said Iain Stealey, who manages JPMorgan Asset Management's Global Bond Opportunities Fund.  What you see now is a combination of that position unwinding and the realisation that if we don't get an election for a while, you get another 172 bps on top of German bonds and a yield of close to 2 percent.  Such steep falls in euro zone yields are rare - the last time was after Britain voted last June to leave the European Union. The uncertainty that followed was seen encouraging central banks to keep monetary policy loose, crushing yields. The slide in Italian yields also follows signals from the European Central Bank that it is no rush to take away monetary stimulus that has helped weaker euro zone economies and signs of progress in fixing a frail banking sector. Italy is close to agreeing with the European Commission a deal to rescue two ailing regional banks while limiting losses for investors, the country's economy minister said on Tuesday.

The conviction of Taimoor Raza, 30, follows a high-profile crackdown against blasphemy on social media by the government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. Blasphemy is a highly sensitive topic in Muslim-majority Pakistan, where insulting the Prophet Mohammad is a capital crime for which dozens are sitting on death row. Even mere accusations are enough to spark mass uproar and mob justice. Shafiq Qureshi, public prosecutor in Bahawalpur, about 500km (300 miles) south of provincial capital Lahore, said Raza was convicted for allegedly making derogatory remarks against Prophet Mohammad, his wives and companions.  An anti terrorism court of Bahawalpur has awarded him the death sentence,  Qureshi told Reuters.  It is the first ever death sentence in a case that involves social media.  It is rare for a counter-terrorism court to hear blasphemy cases but Raza's trial fell under this category because his charge sheet included counter-terrorism offences linked to hate speech. Qureshi said Raza was arrested after playing blasphemous and hate speech material on his phone on a bus stop in Bahawalpur, where a counter-terrorism officer arrested him and confiscated his phone. The material obtained from the phone led to Raza's conviction, he added.  The trial was conducted in Bahawapur jail in tight security,  Qureshi said Qureshi added that Raza belongs to the minority Shia community and in court he accused of spreading  hate speech  against the Deobani sect, which adheres to a strict school of Sunni Islam. Relations between Shia and majority Sunni communities have flared up at times in Pakistan, with some extremist Sunni groups such as Lashkhar-e-Janghvi trying to exploit sectarian tensions. Several other violent incidents linked to blasphemy accusations have alarmed human rights groups and activists in recent months. Police are currently investigating over 20 students and some faculty members in connection with the killing of Mashal Khan, a student who was beaten to death on April following a dorm debate about religion -- an attack that shocked the country. Since then, parliament has discussed adding safeguards to the blasphemy laws, a move seen as groundbreaking in Pakistan where political leaders have been assassinated for even discussing changes. As Raza's blasphemy conviction was under the counter-terrorism court, he will be able to appeal his sentence in the High Court and later in the Supreme Court. There have been at least 67 murders over unproven allegations since 1990, according to figures from a research center and independent records kept by Reuters.

Greece, a member of both groups, says Macedonia's use of the name could imply territorial claims on Greece's most northerly province of the same name.  It is withholding support for Macedonia's further integration until it agrees to change it and has managed to get many international bodies, including the United Nations to formally refer to it as the Former Yugolav Republic of Macedonia, or FYROM.  I'm here to ask for your support,  Foreign Minister Nikola Dimitrov, at one point Skopje's negotiator with Greece over the name, said in Athens.   I'm convinced that you have the leverage in your hands and this leverage can help toward closing the way for the one open issue,  Dimitrov said through an interpreter. Athens would support Macedonia's integration  in every way, once the name issue has been resolved,  Greek Foreign Minister Nikos Kotzias said during a joint news conference.  That is a the pre-requisite and I believe we must - and can - work toward a good compromise benefiting both sides,  Kotzias said.

Athens has previously insisted that Skopje use a compound name such as  New  or  Upper  Macedonia. It also blockaded Macedonia's southern border in the early 1990s, at least in part leading to a change in Macedonia's first flag, which depicted the Vergina Sun, a symbol from the gravesite of the ancient kings of Macedon, which is in Greece. Macedonia's former prime minister, Nikola Gruevski, built his nine-year rule on nationalism and a rejection of Greek demands.

The Spanish company, which also owns younger fashion chain Pull&Bear; and upmarket label Massimo Dutti, said net profit totaled 654 million euros ($733 million) for its first quarter that ended on April 30, in line with analysts' forecasts. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) were 1.1 billion euros, up 17 percent year-on-year and above estimates.

The latest outlook from the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) comes three months after it warned that Australia's most populous states face a gas shortfall from the end of 2018 that could spark power or gas cuts to homes and businesses. That warning, a string of blackouts and soaring energy prices led the Australian government and states to step in to shore up supply, including restarting a mothballed gas-fired power plant, funding huge storage batteries and limiting gas exports.  This latest analysis indicates there will be challenges that will need to be managed proactively on days of extreme conditions to maintain secure, reliable and affordable energy to Australian consumers,  AEMO Chief Executive Audrey Zibelman said in a statement. The AEMO said power supply should be adequate in normal summer weather, assuming 140 megawatts (MW) of energy storage backed by the South Australian and Victorian state governments is in place, there are no planned generator outages and three gas-fired generators return to service as promised. The market will need more coal-fired power in the state of New South Wales, more renewable power and higher output from gas-fired generators to replace a 1,600 MW plant shut by France's Engie SA in neighboring Victoria in March. The grid would be most vulnerable in extreme heat on weekday afternoons and evenings when people switch on air conditioners, with the risk rising if the wind drops and the sun is down or other generation is disrupted at the same time, the AEMO said. Gas supply for two power stations that are being resuscitated to stabilize the grid will be key to avoiding power cuts, the body said in its Energy Supply Outlook (ESO).  The ESO analysis suggests gas supply remains tight, however, the latest industry projections of gas production are just sufficient to meet current projections of gas demand,  the AEMO said. Companies ranging from the world's biggest miners, BHP and Rio Tinto, to steelmakers and brickmakers have raised alarm over unstable power supplies and soaring prices, which are threatening jobs. The AEMO's outlook comes on the heels of a call by Australia's chief scientist calling for the federal government to set a  fuel neutral  clean energy target that provides an incentive to build new generation to cap soaring power prices, cut carbon emissions and keep the lights on.

Chances of a rate hike this year have surged to more than three-in-four after hawkish comments this week from central bank officials, including Governor Stephen Poloz. Chances were less than one-in-four before stronger-than-expected jobs data on Friday.                Strengthening of the currency could put pressure on often-leveraged speculators to cover short positions, which had reached a record high, and accelerate any gains in the loonie.                  At 9:44 a.m. ET (1344 GMT), the Canadian dollar          was trading at C$1.3184 to the greenback, or 75.85 U.S. cents, up 0.4 percent.     The currency's weakest level of the session was C$1.3245, while it touched its strongest since Feb. 28 at C$1.3165.     Gains for the loonie came even as prices of oil, one of Canada's major exports, fell after data showed a build in U.S. crude stocks and OPEC reported a rise in its production despite a pledge to cut supply.           The U.S. dollar        fell against a basket of major currencies after the release of weaker-than-expected U.S. inflation and retail sales data.                  The Federal Reserve was expected today to raise interest rates but weaker economic data could reduce the chances of further U.S. rate increases this year.     Canadian household debt as a share of income dipped in the first quarter but remained near record highs, Statistics Canada said, in a report likely to reinforce concerns that consumers are becoming overly indebted.                      The ratio of debt to disposable income edged down to 166.9 percent from an adjusted 167.2 percent in the fourth quarter.     Separate domestic data showed that home prices rose in May as Toronto remained robust despite recent government efforts to cool the market, while prices in Vancouver picked back up to hit a fresh peak.                    Canadian government bond prices rose across the yield curve in sympathy with U.S. Treasuries. The two-year            rose 7 Canadian cents to yield 0.871 percent and the 10-year             climbed 50 Canadian cents to yield 1.506 percent.     The gap between the 10-year yield and its U.S. equivalent narrowed by 2 basis points to a spread of -62.6 basis points, its smallest since Nov. 8, the day of the U.S. election.

The best day of my life is the day when Christina came back,  said her mother, Aida Nuh, on Saturday.  Dark circles around her eyes are evidence of sleepless nights since August 2014, when the militants snatched Christina from her, a few weeks after overrunning the town of Qaraqosh, 15 km (10 miles) southeast of Mosul.  She stayed three years with the terrorists. Of course she forgot who her mother is, who her father is, that we are her family, but she will learn again.  Islamic State has kidnapped thousands of men, women and children from Iraq's minorities, mainly Yazidis. Christians who did not or could not escape in time were faced with an ultimatum - pay a tax for protection, convert to Islam, or die by the sword. Some, like Christina, were kidnapped.   Christian families who remained in Qaraqosh were forcibly displaced on Aug. 22, 2014. The militants took away Christina from the minibus which had driven them to the edge of Islamic State territory, after threatening Aida, who desperately resisted.

May's Conservative Party, which failed to win a majority in last week's British general election, has been talking to Northern Ireland's largest party, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) to secure the support of their 10 members of parliament in Westminster. But Irish nationalists Sinn Fein have voiced concerns a tie-up could destabilise politics in Northern Ireland and undermine the British government's neutrality in overseeing talks to form a new power-sharing government for the province. Northern Ireland's power-sharing administration, created under a 1998 Good Friday Agreement peace deal, collapsed in January and talks have been going on since a regional election in March to restore it. Sinn Fein has said it does not want the DUP to put forward its leader Arlene Foster as first minister until the results of a corruption probe are finalised. Sinn Fein has said that if May makes concessions to the DUP that would disadvantage Irish nationalists, then a deal would be more difficult to secure. Sinn Fein, which won seven seats in the British parliament at last week's election but will maintain its policy of not taking them, said its leader in Northern Ireland, Michelle, O'Neill would repeat those concerns in London on Thursday.  It's imperative that both governments recommit to the word, spirit and implementation of the Good Friday Agreement if there is to be any prospect of re-establishing the Executive,  O'Neill said in a statement. The Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP), the Ulster Unionists and the Alliance Party - which all failed to win any seats in the general election - said they would also meet May. May's office said Northern Ireland's five main parties would take part, but a spokesman for the DUP did not immediately respond to a request to confirm their participation. âThe context in which the talks process is now being asked to operate could have very serious consequences if there is any suggestion of a back room deal with the DUP. We will be asking the prime minister to be open with politicians and also with the public,  SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said in a statement.

On Sunday, Saif al-Islam's lawyer said his client had been released under an amnesty law passed by parliament from prison in the eastern Libyan town of Zintan, where he had been held since 2011. ICC prosecutor Fatou Bensouda said in a statement that her office was trying to verify Gaddafi's release.  I call on Libya and all other States, if in a position to do so, to immediately arrest and surrender Mr Gaddafi to the ICC,  she said. Saif, whose whereabouts are not known, was last seen by an independent international observer in June 2014. Saif, 44, is the most prominent of the late leader's children, and was touted by some as a reformist successor before the uprising six years ago in which Muammar Gaddafi was toppled and killed. On Sunday, Saif's lawyer Zaidi told Reuters Saif could play an important part in national reconciliation efforts and he would not be turning himself in to the ICC in The Hague. Libya slid into turmoil after Muammar Gaddafi's overthrow, with rival governments and armed alliances competing for power. A U.N.-backed government in Tripoli has struggled to impose its authority and has been rejected by factions in the east. A Tripoli court sentenced Saif to death in absentia in 2015 for war crimes, including killing protesters during the revolution. A statement posted by the attorney general's office in Tripoli on Sunday said he was still wanted under that conviction. The ICC has said that trial did not meet international standards. Zintan, about 145 km (90 miles) southwest of Tripoli, has its own divisions but has been broadly aligned with the government and armed forces based in eastern Libya.

The interior ministry named the two as Lee Zing Yang, 24, and Meng Li Si, 26, and said their violation of visa rules had contributed to their abductions. Previously officials said they were Chinese-language teachers. The two were abducted by armed men pretending to be policemen on May 24 in Quetta, the provincial capital of Baluchistan province. Last week, Islamic State's Amaq news agency said its members had killed them.  Instead of engaging in any business activity, they went to Quetta and under the garb of learning (the) Urdu language from a Korean national ... were actually engaged in preaching,  the ministry said in a statement.  It did not say what kind of preachers they were, nor did it say if the Korean was from North Korea or South Korea.  The interior ministry confirmed the two Chinese had been  killed but it was not clear if their bodies have been found. The kidnapping was a rare crime against Chinese nationals in Pakistan, which has long had close ties to Beijing, but it has alarmed the growing Chinese community in the country. China has pledged to invest $57 billion in Pakistan in projects linked to its  Belt and Road  infrastructure plan aimed at linking China with the Middle East and Europe. But the infusion of cash has come with frequent requests for Pakistan to improve security, especially in the western Baluchistan province that will house a deepwater port and a road artery vital for the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPC). The incident has prompted Pakistan to boost security around Chinese nationals and other foreigners, and accelerated plans for thousands-strong special police protection units to focus on safeguarding Chinese citizens. Interior Minister Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan said in response to the case that there should be a review of the visa process for Chinese nationals entering Pakistan, and for a databank to track Chinese workers in different parts of the country. Khan ordered the databank to be  shared with all security agencies , his ministry said in a statement. At present, Chinese citizens are able to obtain visas faster than other nationals, and for longer periods when their work relates to CPEC projects.  Khan said the government must work on keeping visitors secure but also appeared to try to shift the blame for the security lapse onto the Chinese nationals, saying they should have informed the authorities of their activities.  The Minister observed that it is highly unfortunate that a misuse of the terms of (the) business visa contributed to the unfortunate incident of abduction and subsequent murder of two innocent Chinese,  the ministry said.

The situation here is one of my motivations,  said Nina Yanti, 69 and a recent convert to Islam, who wanted to learn more about the religion.  If we learn alongside others of the same age it's much easier for us.   The students pay 30,000 rupiah ($2.31) for classes that include studying and reciting the Muslim holy book, the Koran, and exploring spiritual development and guidance.

The arrests come a week after diplomats condemned violence against Muslims in Sri Lanka and urged the government to uphold minority rights and freedom of religion. Earlier, legislators blamed the government for failing to stop a spate of attacks on minority Muslims. More than 20 attacks on Muslims have been recorded since April 17, including arson at Muslim-owned businesses and petrol-bomb attacks on mosques while the police said at least 16 such cases had been reported since April. President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremasinghe have ordered police to uphold the law, but the violence against Muslims has not ended. Muslims, who account for around 9 percent of Sri Lanka's population of 21 million, have blamed the attacks on Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) or the  Buddhist Power Force , an organization that says the spread of Islam is a threat to Buddhism as the dominant religion. It denies any involvement.  The police was able to arrest a 32-year-old person who is directly related to four (arson) attacks,  police spokesman Priyantha Jayakody told reporters adding that all four businesses were owned by Muslims.  This person has direct links with Bodu Bala Sena organization. Since 2014, he has been associating with the Bodu Bala Sena.  Bodu Bala Sena in a statement denied its links with the recent attacks and said the organization has no membership.  We have ability to unleash terrorism, extremism and violence, but not behind (latest anti-Muslim) attacks,  CEO of the BBS Dilanthe Withanage said in a statement. Jayakody also said the police had arrested four more people including a Muslim who posted a Facebook post against Buddhism and a Tamil national who attacked a mosque. Buddhists make up about 70 percent of the population, and analysts say some hardline Buddhist organizations have been spreading hate speech against Muslims and encouraging people to boycott Muslim shops. The Buddhist groups accuse some Muslim organizations of radicalising the community and forcefully converting people to Islam and vandalizing Buddhist archaeological sites. Muslim leaders have denied the claim. In 2014, three Muslims were killed in riots stirred up hardline Buddhist groups. President Maithripala Sirisena was elected the following year after a campaign in which he promised to solve the issues faced by ethnic minority Tamils and Muslims. Churches also have faced similar attacks in the past. The government ended a full-blown 26-year civil war by defeating Tamil Tiger rebels in 2009.

We are looking into this application for a guarantee along with the states of North Rhine-Westphalia and Berlin,  a ministry spokeswoman told reporters. She added that presenting a  sustainable concept for the future  was key to getting such a guarantee. Air Berlin's CEO Thomas Winkelmann said on Wednesday it was a  confidential figure  when asked for details of the airline's request for loan guarantees from the two German states.  We're not looking for any kind of taxpayers' money. We don't want to be state-owned. As management, we look at every opportunity over how to restructure the company, and that includes restructuring the debt,  he told Reuters after the carrier's annual general meeting in London. The German carrier, 29 percent-owned by Abu Dhabi-based carrier Etihad, last week asked Berlin and North-Rhine Westphalia (NRW) to consider loan guarantees. German Economics Minister Brigitte Zypries said on Tuesday that the airline was in a  precarious  situation. German newspaper Welt reported on Tuesday that Air Berlin is seeking loan guarantees of around 100 million euros ($112 million). German carrier Air Berlin's aircraft is pictured at Tegel airport in Berlin, Germany, September 29, 2016.Axel Schmidt/File PhotoAir Berlin is expecting a difficult 2017, Winkelmann told the annual general meeting, but also said that Air Berlin's dominant position in key German hubs made it interesting to players in the European market.     Air Berlin Chief Financial Officer Dimitri Courtelis told the AGM that 2017 would be a transitional year, but the company was targeting positive earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) in 2018. German carrier Air Berlin aircrafts are pictured at Tegel airport in Berlin, Germany, June 14, 2017.Hannibal HanschkeAir Berlin is scrambling to protect roughly 8,000 jobs in Germany, mainly based in Berlin and North Rhine-Westphalia. Winkelmann joined Air Berlin in February 2017, and said on arrival that his aim was to reposition the company. Last year, the carrier made a record net loss of 782 million euros after it faced increased competition from leaner rivals for its traditional routes to Spanish holiday destinations.  Winkelmann has previously said that Air Berlin is seeking a partner, and larger rival Lufthansa, which last year agreed a long-term deal to lease 38 planes and crew from Air Berlin, is seen as the obvious investor.   Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr had previously expressed interest in Air Berlin on the condition that its debt pile and costs could be brought down. Travel agencies, monopoly experts and rival carrier Ryanair have also raised competition concerns over any possible takeover of Air Berlin by Lufthansa.    Winkelmann said that Air Berlin's appeal was based in its dominance in Germany's biggest state NRW and Berlin.   That strong market position is, I think, interesting for a couple of players in the European market,  he said.  But we can't comment who or what.

ICC prosecutor Fatou Bensouda said in a statement that her office was trying to verify Gaddafi's release.  I call on Libya and all other States, if in a position to do so, to immediately arrest and surrender Mr Gaddafi to the ICC,  she said. Saif, whose whereabouts are not known, was last seen by an independent international observer in June 2014. Saif, 44, is the most prominent of the late leader's children, and was touted by some as a reformist successor before the uprising six years ago in which Muammar Gaddafi was toppled and killed. On Sunday, Saif's lawyer Zaidi told Reuters Saif could play an important part in national reconciliation efforts and he would not be turning himself in to the ICC in The Hague. Libya slid into turmoil after Muammar Gaddafi's overthrow, with rival governments and armed alliances competing for power. A U.N.-backed government in Tripoli has struggled to impose its authority and has been rejected by factions in the east. A Tripoli court sentenced Saif to death in absentia in 2015 for war crimes, including killing protesters during the revolution. A statement posted by the attorney general's office in Tripoli on Sunday said he was still wanted under that conviction. The ICC has said that trial did not meet international standards. Zintan, about 145 km (90 miles) southwest of Tripoli, has its own divisions but has been broadly aligned with the government and armed forces based in eastern Libya.

Interior Minister Andres Anvelt told Reuters that such a move divided Europe rather than united it.  I don't think any punishing through budget or through some financial punishment is good because we understand Europe is a family of very different countries,  he said in a telephone  interview from Tallinn.  We have to look very much into the future not to break something. We don't need any more exits, it would make the European Union weaker.  Estonia, a former Soviet republic of 1.3 million people that joined the EU in 2004, will assume the rotating presidency for the first time in the second half of the year, with one big challenge being to break an impasse over handling immigration. Italy is furious with peers like Poland and Hungary for declining to help by taking in some of the African refugees and migrants arriving to its Mediterranean shores, despite benefiting from EU payouts that wealthier states provide. Some 1.7 million refugees and migrants have arrived in the EU since 2014 and the bloc has been at loggerheads over how to handle them, the bitter disagreements eating at the member states' unity they desperately need to handle the loss of member Britain. Britain also accounts for some 15 percent of the bloc's common budget, so negotiations over future financial allocations will be harder. Anvelt said Estonia would focus on further tightening the bloc's external borders, hoping that would eventually convince Warsaw and Budapest to change tack. After nearly two years of arm-wrestling, the bloc's executive European Commission on Tuesday lost patience and launched legal cases against Budapest, Warsaw and Prague over the matter. [nL8N1JA3ZW] FILE PHOTO: Migrants stand in line to receive free food outside a derelict customs warehouse in Belgrade, Serbia, March 16, 2017.Marko Djurica/File PhotoThe allied, nationalist-minded governments in Poland and Hungary refuse to host a single person via the EU relocation program and their neighbors Slovakia and the Czech Republic have also been stalling. The easterners cite security concerns for refusing to admit people from the mainly-Muslim Middle East and North Africa, given recent Islamist attacks in Europe. So Anvelt said Estonia, which prides itself in its advanced digital agenda, would push for better and more interlinked databases to help law enforcers address security concerns. E-Policing  Plans include setting up an EU travel pre-authorisation system and an  Entry-Exit  tool to better track third-country nationals traveling on a visa. The bloc also wants to better connect a dozen-or-so different databases for border management, law enforcement and customs.  If you give a clear message that Europe is really, really starting to change its external border policy... it would be much easier to make internal policy decisions,  Anvelt said.   IT systems used in the fields of home affairs and justice... it's quite a good toolbox that the EU is not using today as much as it could.  Similar ideas often got stuck in the past in the EU, partly because of fears such powerful tools would infringe on citizens' privacy. Anvelt said that had not proven true for Estonia. He said another area of focus was arresting smugglers' money made on trafficking refugees and migrants to Europe, their lives in peril in unfit rubber dinghies daring the Mediterranean.   We have a lot more to do in tracking down this money. We need IT systems fit for the 21st century to do it.

Traders have placed a 91 percent chance of the central bank pulling the trigger on a second rate increase this year.

The latest outlook from the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) comes three months after it warned that Australia's most populous states face a gas shortfall from the end of 2018 that could spark power or gas cuts to homes and businesses. That warning, a string of blackouts and soaring energy prices led the Australian government and states to step in to shore up supply, including restarting a mothballed gas-fired power plant, funding huge storage batteries and limiting gas exports.  This latest analysis indicates there will be challenges that will need to be managed proactively on days of extreme conditions to maintain secure, reliable and affordable energy to Australian consumers,  AEMO Chief Executive Audrey Zibelman said in a statement. The AEMO said power supply should be adequate in normal summer weather, assuming 140 megawatts (MW) of energy storage backed by the South Australian and Victorian state governments is in place, there are no planned generator outages and three gas-fired generators return to service as promised. The market will need more coal-fired power in the state of New South Wales, more renewable power and higher output from gas-fired generators to replace a 1,600 MW plant shut by France's Engie SA in neighboring Victoria in March. The grid would be most vulnerable in extreme heat on weekday afternoons and evenings when people switch on air conditioners, with the risk rising if the wind drops and the sun is down or other generation is disrupted at the same time, the AEMO said. Gas supply for two power stations that are being resuscitated to stabilize the grid will be key to avoiding power cuts, the body said in its Energy Supply Outlook (ESO).  The ESO analysis suggests gas supply remains tight, however, the latest industry projections of gas production are just sufficient to meet current projections of gas demand,  the AEMO said. Companies ranging from the world's biggest miners, BHP and Rio Tinto, to steelmakers and brickmakers have raised alarm over unstable power supplies and soaring prices, which are threatening jobs. The AEMO's outlook comes on the heels of a call by Australia's chief scientist calling for the federal government to set a  fuel neutral  clean energy target that provides an incentive to build new generation to cap soaring power prices, cut carbon emissions and keep the lights on.

Rosenworcel, a Democrat, served as an FCC commissioner until the end of 2016 when lawmakers failed to take up her re-nomination under former President Barack Obama, handing Republicans a 2-1 majority on the five-seat commission. The White House announced the decision in a late-night statement on Tuesday. Trump, a Republican, must still fill the final open FCC commissioner slot. Rosenworcel did not immediately reply to a request for comment. Her nomination comes as the agency aims to reverse Obama-era regulations, including the former Democratic president's landmark 2015 net-neutrality rules prohibiting broadband providers from giving or selling access to certain internet services over others. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, tapped by Trump in January, has also said he wants to dismantle other significant regulations as part of a sweeping review that he said would remove barriers to business and modernize rules. If confirmed, Rosenworcel would join Democratic commissioner Mignon Clyburn, whose term ends on June 30. It is not clear if Clyburn plans to stay on the commission. Industry and congressional officials also expect Trump to nominate Brendan Carr, a Republican who is currently general counsel at the FCC and an adviser to Pai, to an open seat.

Last year, Kosovar police arrested 19 people - including the nine charged on Wednesday - on suspicion that they had links with the Islamic State militant group and were planning attacks in Kosovo and neighboring Albania. At the time, fearing such attacks, Albanian authorities moved the Nov. 12 qualifier to a venue near the capital Tirana from a stadium in the northern town of Shkoder. The state prosecutor said some of the nine men charged were in contact with Lavdrim Muhaxheri, a prominent Islamic State member and the self-declared  commander of Albanians in Syria and Iraq  from whom they received orders to attack. Police and family members told Reuters last week that Muhaxheri has been killed in Syria. The group was also planning to launch attacks inside Kosovo against local and international institutions and buy weapons with money received from Muhaxheri, the prosecutor said. NATO has around 4,500 soldiers in Kosovo helping to keep a fragile peace. The European Union and the United Nations also have security and diplomatic missions in Kosovo. The prosecution said the defendants took orders from Muhaxheri and planned to attack and destabilize  the countries in the Balkans and then create their territory of the Islamic State . One of the defendants had kept in his basement 283 grams of self-made triacetone triperoxide (TATP) explosives. The same explosive was used in attacks in Paris and Brussels and was found in a series of foiled bombings in Europe since 2007.  Another defendant had produced half a kilo of explosives at his house from ammonium nitrate and fuel oil (ANFO), it said. Kosovo, with a majority ethnic Albanian Muslim population, has had no militant attacks on its home turf, but at least 200 people have been detained or investigated over offences related to Islamic State. A total of 300 Kosovo nationals have gone to Syria to fight for Islamic State and more than 50 have been killed there. International and local security agencies in Kosovo, including at the NATO mission and the EU police mission, are worried that many of those returning home from combat zones could pose a security threat. In 2015, Kosovo adopted a law introducing jail sentences of up to 15 years for anyone found guilty of fighting in wars abroad.

Central European assets were mostly rangebound as investors awaited a meeting of the Federal Reserve.     The crown shed less than 0.1 percent against the euro by 1307 GMT. But trading at 26.149, it was drifting away from overnight highs at 26.13, its strongest level since the CNB in April removed a cap of 27 on the currency, and also since late 2013 when the cap was introduced.     The crown's strengthening, partly fuelled by expectations of a rebound in inflation and CNB rate hikes, received fresh impetus on Tuesday through  buy  recommendations from banks including Citigroup.     But Tomsik, regarded as a dovish rate setter, was quoted by the newspaper Hospodarske Noviny as saying the crown had got stronger since the bank's latest outlook, which indicated rates rising in the second half of 2017.      (This) means that we do not need to hurry quickly with raising rates,  he said.     Even a delay to the fourth quarter from the third would retain a gap with markets, which have priced in a hike only for the second quarter of 2018, Komercni Banka trader Dalimil Vyskovski said.     He added that Tomsik's comments were  somewhat surprising.      Market rates now (are) increasingly in a 'conundrum' mode.      An auction of Czech government bonds drew decent demand for long-dated papers, but little appetite for the zero-coupon 2022-expiry bond.     Investors in the region seek cues from the U.S. Federal Reserve's guidance over its rate hike cycle.     The Fed is likely to go ahead with another 25-basis-point rate increase on Wednesday, the fourth hike of a rate increase cycle that started in December 2015.     The zloty eased to 4.1945 against the euro.      The tone of the Fed... may create pressure for Polish IRS rates and bond yields to rise, and the holiday in Poland tomorrow may strengthen this reaction,  BZ BWK analysts said in a note.     Warsaw's main equities index dropped slightly, driven by a fall of the shares of Pekao bank and state-run insurer PZU, after PKO's supervisory board dismissed its long-serving, respected Chief Executive Officer Luigi Lovaglio.     PZU and state-controlled fund PFR completed Pekao's takeover from Italian UniCredit last month.     Elsewhere, Budapest's main index hit another record high, briefly piercing the 36,000-point psychological level.

With its antiviral drug, pimodivir, J&J; aims to help treat influenza patients who have developed resistance to existing antiviral drugs as well as address the lack of approved medications for people hospitalized with the virus, the company said. More than one billion people suffer from influenza worldwide each year, resulting in about five million cases of severe illness and up to half a million deaths. J&J;'s trial tested pimodivir as a mono-therapy or in combination with a widely used flu drug, oseltamivir, for the treatment of acute uncomplicated seasonal influenza. Influenza viruses can evolve from one flu season to the next, and even change within the course of the same season. As a flu virus replicates, its genetic makeup may change in a way that results in the virus becoming resistant to treatment. There are three antiviral drugs recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control & Prevention for this season: oseltamivir (which is available as a generic or under the trade name Tamiflu), zanamivir and peramivir. Pimodivir targets another part of the viral replication process when compared to oseltamivir, and if successful, could treat influenza A patients who have developed resistance to existing treatments. J&J; said trial data showed that treatment with pimodivir alone resulted in a statistically significant reduction in viral load in patients over seven days from the start of dosing, when compared with a placebo. Adding pimodivir to oseltamivir also resulted in a significantly lower viral load compared to those who received pimodivir alone, the company added. Pimodivir was granted the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's  fast-track  status in March due to its potential to address medication for patients who develop the  influenza A infection and are hospitalized, or are at high risk of related complications. The Band-aid maker bought the worldwide rights to pimodivir from Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc in 2014, and its development is being funded in part by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. J&J; said it expects to begin a late-stage trial for the drug in the second half of the year. The company's shares were up 0.8 percent at $133.06 in early trading on Wednesday.

As much as I would welcome avoiding such bans, I think it is just as unlikely that we can continue to do without bans in the future,  Munich mayor Dieter Reiter was quoted as saying by the Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper on Wednesday. Asked about the latest nitrogen oxide readings, which the paper said violated European air quality standards well beyond busy trunk roads, the mayor said:  The results are shocking, nobody expected this.  The scandal over rigged diesel emission tests at Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) has already thrown the future of diesel engines into doubt, and has highlighted carmakers' struggle to comply with ever stricter rules on the nitrogen oxides emissions. Shares in German carmakers BMW, Volkswagen and Daimler initially dropped between 0.7 and 1.6 percent amid gains in the broader German market, with traders pointing to the prospect of diesel bans, but later recovered some of their losses.    Related CoverageGerman ministry says disagrees with regional bans on diesel carsA spokesman for BMW, whose products range from electric i3 compact cars to luxury gasoline- and diesel-powered sedans and SUVs, said encouraging electric vehicle use was a better way to improve air quality than imposing a ban on diesel cars. Germany's federal government was also against individual states and cities banning diesel cars, a transport ministry spokesman said on Wednesday with regard to the possibility of a ban being imposed in Munich. The Munich skyline with the famous landmark 'Frauenkirche' (Cathedral of Our Lady) is seen in front of the Alps, Germany, January 26, 2016.Michael Dalder Driving bans are the wrong political approach,  the spokesman said. However, the city of Stuttgart, home of Mercedes-Benz and VW's Porsche subsidiary, is already preparing to ban some diesel vehicles from next year which do not meet the latest emission standards. Sueddeutsche Zeitung said between 133,000 and 170,000 vehicles could be affected by a ban in Munich, depending on how strict it will be, but cars meeting the latest Euro 6 emission standard would be exempt. German environmental campaign group Deutsche Umwelthilfe has launched a legal challenge against Germany's regional states, pushing for measures to improve the air quality in more than two dozen cities. In response the states' environmental ministers have already proposed retrofitting Euro-5 vehicles to meet the stricter Euro-6 standard but it is not yet clear how costs will be split between the state, carmakers and owners. Due to the more efficient fuel burn and lower carbon dioxide emissions compared with gasoline-powered cars, Germany's three major carmakers have invested heavily in diesel technology.    While only a niche market in the United States, about half the new cars sold in Germany were diesel-powered before the VW scandal broke, but the market share has since declined to just over 40 percent. The prospect of diesel bans is also seen weighing on the used vehicle market, which would affect carmakers' leasing and vehicle financing divisions as car loans are secured against these values.

The two have since fled mainly Muslim Chechnya, but they still fear being hunted down and persecuted. They spoke to Reuters on condition that their real names were not used, and their voices and faces disguised. One of the men, who gave his name as Anzor, said he had been detained by police as he was driving in the company of other men from a Chechen village to the Caucasus region's capital Grozny in February.   They found some medicine on one of the guys,  he told Reuters Television. Seeing his rings and bracelets, the policemen asked if he was  a faggot  and beat him severely, the man said in an interview.  Then they ... forced me to tie a cable to my little toe and to my little finger. I was forced to do it myself, to attach the wires. And then they started using electric shocks,  he said.  The accounts that the two men gave could not be independently verified by Reuters. They fit in, however, with a pattern of persecution described by other sources.  Chechnya's Moscow-backed president Ramzan Kadyrov denies human rights are routinely flouted in the region. His spokesman has said there could be no attacks on gay men because there were no such people in Chechnya. The Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta reported in April that authorities in Chechnya had rounded up over 100 gay men or men believed to be gay and tortured them. At least three of the men had been killed, the newspaper reported. Kremlin critics regarded the report as further evidence that Moscow allows authorities in Chechnya to run the region - which has been consumed by two wars since the 1991 disintegration of the Soviet Union - as a feudal fiefdom in exchange for keeping separatist and radical Islamist sentiment suppressed. The second Chechen man, who gave his name as Ramzan, said he had been detained by police in April and told to give the names, addresses and work places of his gay contacts. He was beaten when he declined to obey, he said. He was saved from more serious torture by saying that one of his uncles was a law enforcement officer, he said. But that put his life in danger after police handed him over to relatives who handcuffed him to a radiator in a village house.  There was only one thing left to do: to get rid of me. Because it was such a shame for a military family, for a rather big family. We (in Chechnya) have only one way to resolve this.  He said he managed to escape with the help of his sister.  Nikita Safronov, a Moscow-based LGBT activist, said almost 100 people from Chechnya had already got in touch via an LGBT-network hotline, and that more than 40 of them had been  evacuated . Some had already left Russia, he added.

Russian will host the opening match for FIFA's Confederations Cup on Saturday in St Petersburg, a tournament widely seen as a dress rehearsal for the 2018 World Cup finals. Volgograd, an industrial city 865 km (540 miles) south of Moscow, is not part of the Confederations Cup line up but will host four group-stage matches in the 2018 tournament. Russia's Emergencies Ministry said the blaze, which was put out just before 7 a.m. (0400 GMT), had been caused by a  violation of fire safety regulations during welding . No people were injured or killed in the fire, the ministry said in a statement. A spokeswoman for Stroytransgaz, the company building the stadium, told Reuters the fire was thought to have been caused by a welding spark that ignited thermal insulation materials before spreading to some plastic foam nearby. The company â which is controlled by businessman Gennady Timchenko, a close ally of President Vladimir Putin who was slapped with U.S. sanctions after Russia annexed Crimea in 2014 â has yet to estimate the damage but expects it to be small, the spokeswoman said. Video footage of the blaze circulated by Russian media showed a plume of thick smoke rising from the carcass of the 45,000-seat stadium.  There was simply a lot of smoke, which made it look really bad, but no major damage,  a source in the local World Cup organising committee told Reuters.  Some smoke damage to one of the columns but that can be painted over.  Russia will host the World Cup finals next year in 12 venues spread across 11 cities, including Moscow, Saint Petersburg, Sochi and Kazan. These four cities are hosting the Confederations Cup, a two-week tournament that will feature the host country, world champions Germany and the various regional champions.

In a Wednesday securities filing, JBS said ProenÃ§a will structure and monitor compliance procedures across JBS inside and outside the company. The newly-created division will report directly to the board, in order to ensure  the best possible corporate governance practices,  the filing added. Law firm White & Case LLC was hired to help provide support for ProenÃ§a and oversee the creation of JBS's compliance unit, the filing said. ProenÃ§a has a bachelor and PhD degrees in law and has 27 years experience, especially in corporate and commercial law. Last month, Brazil's billionaire Batista family - which owns over 40 percent of JBS through investment holding company J&F; Investimentos SA - agreed to pay a record-setting 10.3 billion real ($3.1 billion) fine related to corruption and bribery allegations. The move is akin to one that engineering conglomerate Odebrecht SA took in the wake of a similar accord linked to a corruption probe. Brazil's law orders companies to revamp their compliance rules and corporate governance codes to approve a leniency deal and shelter them and their executives from future prosecution. JBS shares rose as much as 0.6 percent to 6.85 reais in early Wednesday trading, paring back year-to-date losses to 40 percent. The stock has shed 37 percent since May 16, when Brothers Joesley and Wesley Batista admitted in separate plea deals to bribing nearly 1,900 politicians in recent years. State loans helped fuel growth at J&F; over the past decade, enabling it to assert control of JBS while expanding into fashion, dairy production, pulp processing and banking. JBS grew from a mid-sized slaughterhouse in Brazil's Midwest into one of the world's top-three food processing companies in over a decade through acquisitions partially funded with government funding. Part of the testimonies in the plea deal implicated President Michel Temer, whom Joesley accused of working to obstruct a major corruption probe.

With its antiviral drug, pimodivir, J&J; aims to help treat influenza patients who have developed resistance to existing antiviral drugs as well as address the lack of approved medications for people hospitalized with the virus, the company said. More than one billion people suffer from influenza worldwide each year, resulting in about five million cases of severe illness and up to half a million deaths. J&J;'s trial tested pimodivir as a mono-therapy or in combination with a widely used flu drug, oseltamivir, for the treatment of acute uncomplicated seasonal influenza. Influenza viruses can evolve from one flu season to the next, and even change within the course of the same season. As a flu virus replicates, its genetic makeup may change in a way that results in the virus becoming resistant to treatment. There are three antiviral drugs recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control & Prevention for this season: oseltamivir (which is available as a generic or under the trade name Tamiflu), zanamivir and peramivir. Pimodivir targets another part of the viral replication process when compared to oseltamivir, and if successful, could treat influenza A patients who have developed resistance to existing treatments. J&J; said trial data showed that treatment with pimodivir alone resulted in a statistically significant reduction in viral load in patients over seven days from the start of dosing, when compared with a placebo. Adding pimodivir to oseltamivir also resulted in a significantly lower viral load compared to those who received pimodivir alone, the company added. Pimodivir was granted the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's  fast-track  status in March due to its potential to address medication for patients who develop the  influenza A infection and are hospitalized, or are at high risk of related complications. The Band-aid maker bought the worldwide rights to pimodivir from Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc in 2014, and its development is being funded in part by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. J&J; said it expects to begin a late-stage trial for the drug in the second half of the year. The company's shares were up 0.8 percent at $133.06 in early trading on Wednesday.

The peso fell to its lowest level in history against the dollar on Jan. 19, the day before U.S. President Donald Trump's inauguration, as traders worried that his campaign pledges to scrap the North American Free Trade Agreement and erect a wall between the two countries would weaken the Mexican economy. But since Trump moved into the White House the peso has been on a tear, rising more than 20 percent against the dollar. It has been the world's best performing major currency so far this year. Rhetoric from Trump's administration has become less corrosive since he took office. This and the Bank of Mexico's aggressive monetary policy, including unexpectedly raising its benchmark interest rate last month to an eight-year high of 6.75 percent, have helped the peso firm to its highest level since Aug. 16. Fund managers told Reuters they largely believe the peso's growth will continue.   (The peso) has had good momentum relative to other emerging currencies in recent months, and that could continue for some time longer,  said Morgan Harting, lead portfolio manager for all multi-asset income strategies at AllianceBernstein.   And though it is no longer cheap, it also does not look expensive in terms of purchasing power parity.  One of the primary factors helping the peso's rise has been the reversal of speculator positions on the currency. Last week, speculators raised the number of net-long contracts on the peso to 84,821, the highest since June 2014.   This is partly due to the changes in U.S. politics, and partly as global economic headwinds have dissipated somewhat â allowing carry trades to flourish again,  said Ken Dickson, investment director, foreign exchange, at Standard Life Investments. Javier Murcio, senior sovereign analyst for emerging market strategies at Standish, a division of Bank of New York Mellon Corp, said the results of recent state elections in which left-wing candidates were unable to unseat traditional powers was also a strong sign.  However, he warned the peso was nearing important technical resistance levels at which traders could reduce or reverse their positions.  Chances for further appreciation remain, but as the inflation adjusted exchange rate begins to lose competitiveness, important floors may appear at 18/USD or even 17.75, which are levels at which further gains may be difficult to sustain,  Murcio said in an email. Alejo Czerwonko, an emerging market strategist at UBS Wealth Management, said earlier this week that while he remains bullish, the peso is nearing the asset manager's target of 18 pesos per dollar. The peso broke through that level Wednesday morning after data showing unexpectedly soft U.S. consumer prices and retail sales data. With the U.S. dollar continuing to weaken despite expectations for interest rate increases from the Federal Reserve, investors who hold the peso remain bullish.  As long as the (U.S. dollar) is stable to lower, we believe the currency can continue to appreciate even if the (Mexican) central bank begins to cut rates later this year,  said Jim Barrineau, co-head of emerging markets debt relative at Schroders.

Politicians fear that a proliferation of such posts directed at the more than one million Muslim migrants who have entered Germany in the last two years might sway public opinion in the September election. Critics said the government was rushing through legislation that could damage free speech. The proposal known as the  Facebook Law  had not clearly defined what constituted a punishable offence, the Wissenschaftlicher Dienst said in a non-binding opinion.  The draft law doesn't specify guidelines, examples or reference points to define criminal or punishable content,  it said.  It would have been extremely useful to provide data as well as studies to help make a proper assessment of the danger posed by the dissemination of punishable hateful content and fake news and the assumed destructive effect they have.  Under the law, Facebook (FB.O), Twitter (TWTR.N) and Google-parent Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) would face up to 50 million euros ($56 million) in fines for not removing posts promptly. Martin Ott, Facebook's chief in Germany, told Handelsblatt newspaper in an interview published on Tuesday that the draft law was problematic because it shifted the legal responsibility from the courts to companies.  We don't think the law meets its aim as a private company should not decide what is legal or illegal,  he said.  This is the job of courts.  A justice ministry spokesman said the research body's reservations would be taken into consideration and any proposed amendments would be debated by parliamentary committees. The draft law would give social networks 24 hours to delete or block obviously criminal content and seven days to deal with less clear-cut cases, with an obligation to report back to the person who filed the complaint about how they handled the case.

Bekinda is a once-daily oral pill formulation of the existing anti-nausea drug ondansetron and is designed to provide relief from nausea and vomiting symptoms for a 24-hour period. Data showed Bekinda can provide patients with 24 hours of relief and works regardless of the initial severity of gastroenteritis, the company said. RedHill is still analyzing the dataset and plans to discuss the path to approval with the Food and Drug Administration, it added on Wednesday. Gastroenteritis is a very common illness in the United States, with about 179 million cases annually, and can be caused by many different infectious agents, typically viral infections, according to the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention.

Thirty-eight years later, his youngest child became the once-staunchly Catholic country's first openly gay prime minister, its first of Indian descent and the youngest person ever to hold the office. Varadkar's election in parliament on Wednesday, 10 days after he succeeded Enda Kenny as leader of the governing Fine Gael party, marks another symbolic moment for Ireland.  If my election today shows anything, it is that prejudice has no hold in this Republic,  Varadkar said to huge applause on June 2 after winning the leadership of the center-right party.  I know when my father traveled 5,000 miles to build a new home in Ireland, I doubt that he ever dreamed that one day his son would grow up to be its leader and despite his differences, his son would be judged by his actions not his identity.   Every proud parent in Ireland today can dream big dreams for their children,  Varadkar said. The fact the milestone of electing a gay premier is barely mentioned in local media and has taken place -- in the words of one former government minister --  without anybody batting an eyelid  shows just how far Ireland has come. Instead, after six years of Kenny's steady stewardship, the focus has been on the stark change of style likely to follow the election of a minister known as a straight talker. Colleagues giddily proclaim that their new leader has the 'X Factor'. 'Once-in-a-Generation Politician' Varadkar had not been born when Kenny, 66, was first elected as a member of parliament and comes from the generation hit hardest by Ireland's economic meltdown. He owned an apartment that fell into negative equity at the turn of the decade. Leo Varadkar is congratulated by colleagues as he leaves Government buildings after being elected by parliamentary vote as the next Prime Minister of Ireland (Taoiseach) to replace Enda Kenny in Dublin, Ireland June 14, 2017.Clodagh KilcoyneHe will also be a year younger than France's Emmanuel Macron when he attends his first EU leaders summit later this month. But Varadkar has been quick to point out that the favorite to become Austria's new prime minister, Sebastian Kurz, is eight years younger.  He's a once-in-a-generation politician,  said Fine Gael member of parliament Jim Daly, echoing the comments of most of his colleagues who have placed high hopes in Varadkar. Such a dramatic change of style could go two ways, analysts warn. Varadkar's tendency to shoot from the hip can backfire. As a novice minister he said Ireland would likely need a second bailout six months after signing its 2010 EU/IMF package. Colleagues were furious and Ireland went on to exit the bailout on schedule in 2013. Slideshow (2 Images) When you're Taoiseach (prime minister), you can't speak as open and freely as when you're a maverick, straight-shooting minister. If he doesn't temper his more colorful contributions, that could actually become a liability quite quickly,  said Theresa Reidy, a politics lecturer at University College Cork. She said that although he has held three cabinet post since 2011, Varadkar is relatively inexperienced. With the exception of Kenny, every prime minister since the 1960s either served as finance or foreign minister prior to taking office. Kenny sat in parliament for 35 years before his elevation. Varadkar was first elected in 2007. Seen as being on the right wing of the centrist Fine Gael, Varadkar also upset Ireland's left with a recent publicity campaign highlighting social welfare fraud. And his management style will be tested by Fine Gael's weak minority government that is backed by independent lawmakers and facilitated by the main opposition party.  As someone who once described himself as not being  a natural people's person , the trained doctor will need a good bedside manner.  We don't really know how he will react under pressure and it is different when you're Taoiseach,  Reidy said.

It would be the second consecutive week in which the White House will make a push to show Trump is moving ahead on his top domestic priority - jobs - in spite of investigations into whether he had anything to do with possible Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Trump has refuted those allegations, which have overshadowed his efforts to boost economic growth. Last week was branded  infrastructure week  with a series of events dealing with fixing the nation's decrepit roads and bridges, another plank in Trump's jobs platform. But a congressional hearing on the Russia imbroglio featuring James Comey - the FBI director Trump fired - sucked up all the attention in Washington. Next week will be  workforce development week  where the White House highlights plans to combat the skills gap. U.S. job openings surged to a record high in April with government data showing employers struggling to find workers with the right skills. Trump's plan has been in the works for months, led by his daughter Ivanka Trump, adviser Reed Cordish, and Trump's secretaries of labor, education and commerce. The White House was mum on the precise details of Trump's plan to expand apprenticeships ahead of his unveiling it in a speech at the Labor Department on Wednesday.

Â Â Â  Ivanka Trump discussed the issue with German Chancellor Angela Merkel at the White House in March, and toured a Siemens training center in Berlin in April. Trump will travel to Wisconsin on Tuesday to visit a training program at Waukesha County Technical College with Republican Governor Scott Walker, a former rival in the race to become the 2016 Republican presidential candidate. On Wednesday, Ivanka Trump will hold a roundtable on the issue with 15 CEOs at the White House. The president will then meet with eight governors on Thursday to discuss the topic at the White House. The White House declined to say which CEOs and governors would be there. One thing that likely will not be in Trump's plan: a surge in spending. The White House expects the private sector to take the lead.  A senior White House official said the federal government had allocated $16.7 billion to 43 job training programs in 13 agencies in fiscal 2017.  It's not a money question.

The two have since fled mainly Muslim Chechnya, but they still fear being hunted down and persecuted. They spoke to Reuters on condition that their real names were not used, and their voices and faces disguised. One of the men, who gave his name as Anzor, said he had been detained by police as he was driving in the company of other men from a Chechen village to the Caucasus region's capital Grozny in February.   They found some medicine on one of the guys,  he told Reuters Television. Seeing his rings and bracelets, the policemen asked if he was  a faggot  and beat him severely, the man said in an interview.  Then they ... forced me to tie a cable to my little toe and to my little finger. I was forced to do it myself, to attach the wires. And then they started using electric shocks,  he said.  The accounts that the two men gave could not be independently verified by Reuters. They fit in, however, with a pattern of persecution described by other sources.  Chechnya's Moscow-backed president Ramzan Kadyrov denies human rights are routinely flouted in the region. His spokesman has said there could be no attacks on gay men because there were no such people in Chechnya. The Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta reported in April that authorities in Chechnya had rounded up over 100 gay men or men believed to be gay and tortured them. At least three of the men had been killed, the newspaper reported. Kremlin critics regarded the report as further evidence that Moscow allows authorities in Chechnya to run the region - which has been consumed by two wars since the 1991 disintegration of the Soviet Union - as a feudal fiefdom in exchange for keeping separatist and radical Islamist sentiment suppressed. The second Chechen man, who gave his name as Ramzan, said he had been detained by police in April and told to give the names, addresses and work places of his gay contacts. He was beaten when he declined to obey, he said. He was saved from more serious torture by saying that one of his uncles was a law enforcement officer, he said. But that put his life in danger after police handed him over to relatives who handcuffed him to a radiator in a village house.  There was only one thing left to do: to get rid of me. Because it was such a shame for a military family, for a rather big family. We (in Chechnya) have only one way to resolve this.  He said he managed to escape with the help of his sister.  Nikita Safronov, a Moscow-based LGBT activist, said almost 100 people from Chechnya had already got in touch via an LGBT-network hotline, and that more than 40 of them had been  evacuated . Some had already left Russia, he added.

As much as I would welcome avoiding such bans, I think it is just as unlikely that we can continue to do without bans in the future,  Munich mayor Dieter Reiter was quoted as saying by the Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper on Wednesday. Asked about the latest nitrogen oxide readings, which the paper said violated European air quality standards well beyond busy trunk roads, the mayor said:  The results are shocking, nobody expected this.  The scandal over rigged diesel emission tests at Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) has already thrown the future of diesel engines into doubt, and has highlighted carmakers' struggle to comply with ever stricter rules on the nitrogen oxides emissions. Shares in German carmakers BMW, Volkswagen and Daimler initially dropped between 0.7 and 1.6 percent amid gains in the broader German market, with traders pointing to the prospect of diesel bans, but later recovered some of their losses.    Related CoverageGerman ministry says disagrees with regional bans on diesel carsA spokesman for BMW, whose products range from electric i3 compact cars to luxury gasoline- and diesel-powered sedans and SUVs, said encouraging electric vehicle use was a better way to improve air quality than imposing a ban on diesel cars. Germany's federal government was also against individual states and cities banning diesel cars, a transport ministry spokesman said on Wednesday with regard to the possibility of a ban being imposed in Munich. The Munich skyline with the famous landmark 'Frauenkirche' (Cathedral of Our Lady) is seen in front of the Alps, Germany, January 26, 2016.Michael Dalder Driving bans are the wrong political approach,  the spokesman said. However, the city of Stuttgart, home of Mercedes-Benz and VW's Porsche subsidiary, is already preparing to ban some diesel vehicles from next year which do not meet the latest emission standards. Sueddeutsche Zeitung said between 133,000 and 170,000 vehicles could be affected by a ban in Munich, depending on how strict it will be, but cars meeting the latest Euro 6 emission standard would be exempt. German environmental campaign group Deutsche Umwelthilfe has launched a legal challenge against Germany's regional states, pushing for measures to improve the air quality in more than two dozen cities. In response the states' environmental ministers have already proposed retrofitting Euro-5 vehicles to meet the stricter Euro-6 standard but it is not yet clear how costs will be split between the state, carmakers and owners. Due to the more efficient fuel burn and lower carbon dioxide emissions compared with gasoline-powered cars, Germany's three major carmakers have invested heavily in diesel technology.    While only a niche market in the United States, about half the new cars sold in Germany were diesel-powered before the VW scandal broke, but the market share has since declined to just over 40 percent. The prospect of diesel bans is also seen weighing on the used vehicle market, which would affect carmakers' leasing and vehicle financing divisions as car loans are secured against these values.

The epidemiologist from the U.S. National Cancer Institute had seen important unpublished scientific data relating directly to a key question the IARC specialists were about to consider: Whether research shows that the weedkiller glyphosate, a key ingredient in Monsanto's best-selling RoundUp brand, causes cancer. Previously unreported court documents reviewed by Reuters from an ongoing U.S. legal case against Monsanto show that Blair knew the unpublished research found no evidence of a link between glyphosate and cancer. In a sworn deposition given in March this year in connection with the case, Blair also said the data would have altered IARC's analysis. He said it would have made it less likely that glyphosate would meet the agency's criteria for being classed as  probably carcinogenic.  But IARC, a semi-autonomous part of the World Health Organization, never got to consider the data. The agency's rules on assessing substances for carcinogenicity say it can consider only published research â and this new data, which came from a large American study on which Blair was a senior researcher, had not been published. The lack of publication has sparked debate and contention. A leading U.S. epidemiologist and a leading UK statistician â both independent of Monsanto â told Reuters the data was strong and relevant and they could see no reason why it had not surfaced. Monsanto told Reuters that the fresh data on glyphosate could and should have been published in time to be considered by IARC, and that the failure to publish it undermined IARC's classification of glyphosate. The legal case against Monsanto, taking place in California, involves 184 individual plaintiffs who cite the IARC assessment and claim exposure to RoundUp gave them cancer. They allege Monsanto failed to warn consumers of the risks. Monsanto denies the allegations. The company also goes beyond saying the fresh data should have been published. It told Reuters the data was deliberately concealed by Blair, but provided no specific evidence of it being hidden. Blair told Reuters the data, which was available two years before IARC assessed glyphosate, was not published in time because there was too much to fit into one scientific paper. Asked whether he deliberately did not publish it to avoid it being considered by IARC, he said that was  absolutely incorrect.  He said a decision not to publish the glyphosate data had been taken  several months  before IARC chose to conduct a review of the chemical. The National Cancer Institute also cited  space constraints  as the reasons why the new data on glyphosate was not published. At Odds The absence of the data from IARC's assessment was important. IARC ended its meeting in 2015 by concluding that glyphosate is a  probable human carcinogen.  It based its finding on  limited evidence  of carcinogenicity in humans and  sufficient evidence  in experimental animals. It said, among other things, that there was a  positive association  between glyphosate and blood cancers called non-Hodgkin lymphoma. IARC told Reuters that, despite the existence of fresh data about glyphosate, it was sticking with its findings. The agency's assessment is at odds with other international regulators who have said the weedkiller is not a carcinogenic risk to humans. It led to a delay in Europe on a decision on whether to re-license or ban EU-wide sales of pesticides containing glyphosate. That decision is still pending. In the meantime, some countries have tightened restrictions on the weedkiller's use in private gardens and public spaces and on crops before harvest. In the United States, a California judge took the IARC assessment into account in a separate legal case in March when ruling that the state can require RoundUp to carry a warning label that it may cause cancer. Monsanto is now facing further litigation from hundreds of plaintiffs across the United States who say glyphosate gave them or their loved ones non-Hodgkin lymphoma, citing the IARC assessment as part of their claims. Yet if the IARC panel experts had been in a position to take into account Blair's fresh data, IARC's analysis of the evidence on glyphosate would have been different, Blair acknowledged in the court documents reviewed by Reuters. The unpublished research came from the Agricultural Health Study, a large and significant study, led by scientists at the U.S. National Cancer Institute, of agricultural workers and their families in the United States. Asked by Monsanto lawyers in March whether the unpublished data showed  no evidence of an association  between exposure to glyphosate and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Blair replied:  Correct.  Asked in the same deposition whether IARC's review of glyphosate would have been different if the missing data had been included, Blair again said:  Correct.   Lawyers had put to him that the addition of the missing data would have  driven the meta-relative risk downward,  and Blair agreed. Scott Partridge, Monsanto's vice president of strategy, told Reuters the IARC glyphosate review  ignored multiple years of additional data from the largest and most comprehensive study on farmer exposure to pesticides and cancer.  The Agricultural Health Study was particularly pertinent, he said, because it examined real-life human exposure to glyphosate, whereas much of the scientific research IARC analyzed involved laboratory tests on rodents. IARC told Reuters that its evaluations follow strict scientific criteria and that its carcinogen classification system  is recognized and used as a reference all around the world.  It reiterated that in the interests of transparency it considers only published data. Reuters asked two independent statistical experts to review the data, which has still not been published, though the National Cancer Institute told Reuters researchers are currently working on an updated analysis of it. Neither of the two experts had seen the data before and both said they had no conflict of interest over glyphosate. David Spiegelhalter, a professor of the Public Understanding of Risk at Britain's University of Cambridge, said there was  no apparent scientific reason  for not publishing the data. Bob Tarone, a retired statistician who worked alongside Blair and others at the National Cancer Institute for 28 years before moving to the for-profit International Epidemiology Institute, said he could find  no ready explanation in terms of the available scientific evidence  for the data not to have been published. Tarone had already raised the issue in a little-noticed paper in the European Journal of Cancer Prevention last year. He wrote that IARC's classification of glyphosate as probably carcinogenic to humans was the result of  a flawed and incomplete summary  of the evidence. In an email to Reuters, IARC declined to say whether Blair informed IARC staff about the unpublished data, whether he should have, and whether that data might have changed IARC's evaluation of glyphosate had it been published in time. The agency said it had no plans to reconsider its assessment of the chemical. Non-Selective Herbicide Glyphosate is what's known as a non-selective herbicide, meaning it kills most plants. Discovered by the Monsanto chemist John E. Franz in 1970, glyphosate is no longer under patent, is supplied by numerous companies and is now the world's most widely used weedkiller, deployed in agriculture, forestry and domestic gardening. Monsanto and other companies have developed genetically engineered seeds that can tolerate glyphosate, allowing farmers to apply it to entire fields without destroying crops. The safety of the chemical has been under scientific and regulatory scrutiny since the 1980s. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and other international bodies, including the European Food Safety Authority, Health Canada's Pest Management Regulatory Agency, New Zealand's Environmental Protection Authority and Japan's Food Safety Commission, have kept it under regular review, and all say glyphosate is unlikely to cause cancer in humans. But it is not settled science, and researchers across the world continue to study glyphosate - measuring traces of it in water and foods, exposing lab rats to it, and monitoring possible health effects in people who have used it year after year in their work. FILE PHOTO: Rows of corn wait to be harvested in a field in Minooka, Illinois, September 24, 2014.  To match Special Report GLYPHOSATE-CANCER/DATAJim Young/File PhotoOne of the largest and most highly regarded studies to examine effects of pesticide use in real life is the Agricultural Health Study, a prospective investigation of about 89,000 agricultural workers, farmers and their families in Iowa and North Carolina. Since the early 1990s, it has gathered and analyzed detailed information on the health of participants and their families, and their use of pesticides, including glyphosate. AHS researchers have published numerous studies from their data. One paper looking at glyphosate and possible links with cancers was published in 2005. It concluded that  glyphosate exposure was not associated with cancer incidence overall.  Since then, more data has been collected, adding statistical power to subsequent AHS analyses. In early 2013, Blair and other researchers began preparing new papers with updated AHS data on lymphoma and pesticides, including data on glyphosate. Reuters reviewed drafts dated February 2013 and March 2013, and asked Spiegelhalter and Tarone to examine them. They said the papers, while still in the editing process, were in relatively advanced manuscript form. The drafts contain notes in the margin and suggested changes signed  AEB,  Blair's full initials. After studying the draft papers, Tarone said the unpublished figures show  absolutely no evidence whatsoever  of an increased risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma because of exposure to glyphosate. Spiegelhalter told Reuters:  In the drafts I saw, none of the herbicides, including glyphosate, showed any evidence of a relation  with non-Hodgkin lymphoma. He noted that the study was statistically strong enough to show a relationship for other pesticides - so had there been any link to glyphosate, it should have shown up. In his legal testimony, Blair also described the Agricultural Health Study as  powerful  and agreed the data showed no link. But these draft papers were never published, even though Blair told Monsanto's lawyers in March that the Agricultural Health Study was robust and statistically well-powered, and told Reuters the research was important for science and the public. Email exchanges between Blair and his fellow researchers in 2014 also show they were keenly aware there would be scientific and public interest in fresh AHS data. On February 28, 2014, Michael Alavanja, a co-lead author of one of the draft papers, sent an email to another AHS co-researcher, copying the message to Blair. It noted that the research was  important to science, public health, IARC and EPA  - the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. In the same email, Alavanja referred to the findings on non-Hodgkin lymphoma, or NHL. He wrote:  It would be irresponsible if we didn't seek publication of our NHL manuscript in time to influence IARCs (sic) decision.  Slideshow (4 Images)Yet the new AHS data on glyphosate and lymphoma did not surface. Instead, a revised version of one of the 2013 draft papers prepared by Blair and other researchers appeared in a journal called PLoS One in October 2014. It did not include the data on herbicides, of which glyphosate is one. This was unusual. Since 2003 AHS researchers had published at least 10 papers using different rounds of updated data to explore possible links between pesticides and specific diseases. And each one included all four pesticide classes: fungicides, fumigants, insecticides and herbicides. Alavanja was one of the authors of the paper published in PLoS One in 2014. He said he and other authors and senior scientists at the National Cancer Institute decided to remove herbicides from that analysis primarily because of  the issue of statistical power and the need for a comprehensive evaluation of glyphosate and all cancers.  Blair told Reuters the data on herbicides, including glyphosate, had been removed  to make the paper a more manageable size.  He gave a similar answer to the lawyer acting for Monsanto, who repeatedly asked in the legal deposition why the data was not published. Blair testified that the paper  went through many iterations.  He said he could not recall when the glyphosate data was removed, but  we decided to remove it because ... you couldn't put it all into one paper.  Monsanto argues that the data was not published because it showed no link between glyphosate and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Tarone said the absence of herbicide data in the published 2014 paper was  inexplicable,  noting that volume of data had not been an issue in any previous published papers. He said updated AHS data and analyses on herbicides  should be published as soon as possible  to allow  a more complete evaluation of the possible association between glyphosate exposure and NHL risk in humans.  Reuters asked nine other scientists listed as authors on the two draft papers of 2013 why these drafts had never been published. Some were unavailable for comment, and others referred questions to Laura Beane Freeman, who was a co-author on the draft papers and on the 2014 PLoS published study, and is the National Cancer Institute's current principal investigator of the AHS. In an email to Reuters, Freeman and a spokesman for the institute said:  After reviewing early drafts of the manuscript, it became clear that it would be impossible to do a thorough evaluation of all major pesticide groupings due to the sheer volume of information that was important to include.  They said the decision to separate the results for herbicides, including glyphosate, allowed the scientists  to present more thorough evaluations  of the remaining pesticides.  An updated study on glyphosate is under way, Freeman said. Culture Clash Despite IARC's modest size and budget, its monographs - assessments of whether something is a cause of cancer - often catch the eyes and ears of policymakers and the public. Recent IARC monographs have included judgments that red meat is carcinogenic and should be classified alongside arsenic and smoking, and that coffee, which IARC previously said might cause cancer, probably is not carcinogenic. The agency takes a different approach to many other regulators in two important ways. First, it says it assesses  hazard  â the strength of evidence about whether a substance or activity can cause cancer in any way, whether in a laboratory experiment or elsewhere. It does not assess the  risk  or likelihood of a person getting cancer from everyday exposure to something. Second, in general it only considers research that has been published in peer-reviewed scientific journals. IARC considered around 1,000 published studies in its evaluation of glyphosate. But only a handful of those were cohort studies in humans â the kind like the Agricultural Health Study and the most relevant to real-life situations such as people working with glyphosate in agriculture. The differing judgments on glyphosate by IARC and other regulators have stoked clashes on both sides of the Atlantic.  In the United States members of Congress have launched investigations into American taxpayer funding of IARC. They have yet to reach any conclusions. In Europe, the battle centers on the looming decision about whether to re-license glyphosate for use in the European Union. The European Commission has said it wants EU member states to come to a decision by the end of 2017. Politicians will need to weigh the opinions of IARC and other scientific bodies when they decide whether or not to accept a Commission proposal to extend glyphosate's marketing license by 10 years. It remains unclear whether the AHS data will see the light of day in time to be considered. Blair said he thought publishing the glyphosate data would be important and that his former colleagues at the NCI were working on it. The NCI's Freeman said her team is currently  drafting a manuscript on this topic.  She said the new study  will explore the effects of glyphosate exposure in greater depth than a publication that includes multiple pesticides  and would, she hoped, be submitted  to a peer-reviewed journal in the coming months.  Alavanja said a draft paper  should be available for submission to an appropriate scientific journal sometime later this year,  but that a publication date  is very difficult to predict.

The motion had not been expected to garner the majority of votes needed to oust Rajoy given the Socialists had said they would abstain and the liberal Ciudadanos and other smaller regional parties had said they would vote against the proposal. Slideshow (3 Images)But the move from Podemos was primarily aimed at portraying the party as leader of the opposition to the center-right government at a time when the Socialists have just picked a new leader and are struggling with falling support, analysts say.  We are on the right track to build up an alternative majority,  Podemos leader Pablo Iglesias said after the vote.  Today, we are one step closer to removing the People's Party from the institutions.  The motion was rejected with 170 votes against, 82 votes for and 97 abstentions, roughly in line with the breakdown when Rajoy was voted in as prime minister last year, showing there has been no change in the balance of power in parliament. Rajoy, who has secured support for the budget and obtained as a result at least two years of stability, said he was satisfied with the outcome of the vote.

The Wall Street Journal, citing people familiar with the matter, reported late on Tuesday that talks between Hexagon and the potential buyers were at an early stage and that the company may ultimately decide not to pursue a sale. Industrial software and technology firms are in high demand as manufacturing processes become more automated and intelligent through the use of sensors to gather more digital data.  Recent deals include Siemens' (SIEGn.DE) $4.5 billion acquisition of U.S.-based Mentor Graphics, announced late last year, and ABB's (ABBN.S) purchase of industrial automation company Bernecker & Rainer.  Hexagon said in a statement on Wednesday it  regularly evaluates various opportunities to optimize the companyâs positioning and shareholder value .   Should these evaluations lead to concrete results, the market will be immediately informed,  it said. Shares in Hexagon rose more than 17 percent in early trade and were still up 11.3 percent at 420.40 crowns by 1008 GMT, valuing the company at about 150 billion crowns ($17.3 billion) and putting it just outside the 10 largest Swedish listed firms and well ahead of companies such as home appliances maker Electrolux (ELUXb.ST).   Swedbank analyst Mathias Lundberg said a deal was possible but expressed doubts about the reported price tag.   If you look at the price tag it's too low to let Hexagon go. And the company has a long way left on its own journey. They are merely at the beginning of the whole digitalization part,  he said. Swedbank has a neutral rating on the stock.  Investment firm Melker Schorling AB (MELK.ST), Hexagon's biggest shareholder with a 26 percent stake and 46.9 percent of voting rights as of the end of May, declined to comment. Its shares were up 6 percent. The second biggest owner in Hexagon is fashion retailer H&M; Hennes & Mauritz's (HMb.ST) chairman Stefan Persson's Ramsbury Invest, with a 4.8 percent stake. Turmoil Over the past year Chief Executive Ola Rollen has faced allegations of insider trading while long-time chairman Melker Schorling recently stepped down due to poor health. Rollen's trial in Norway on charges of insider trading, which relates to an investment that did not involve Hexagon, is expected to start in late October. Rollen denies wrongdoing.  As CEO, Rollen has helped transform a sprawling conglomerate with a market value of a few billion crowns in 2000 into a measurement technology market leader following a steady stream of acquisitions and high growth. In February it bought U.S.-based MSC Software in a $834 million deal to boost its portfolio in automated manufacturing. Hexagon counts Trimble Navigation (TRMB.O), Autodesk (ADSK.O) and Dassault Systemes (DAST.PA) among its competitors. Its sensors and software are used for measurement and quality inspection in manufacturing processes and in engineering plant design and operations. Its products are also used in areas such as infrastructure planning, construction, mining, agriculture and energy.  I think it is not unlikely there will be some kind of structural change in Hexagon over time,  Handelsbanken Capital Markets analyst Daniel Djurberg said, pointing to Hexagon's industrial-focused business as the main attraction for prospective buyers.  But I think it would be a complex process for potential buyers to buy all of Hexagon with a big premium if they only are interested in half of the company.        Hexagon, which has around 18,000 staff, had sales of 3.1 billion euros in 2016 and is aiming for sales of 4.6-5.1 billion euros by 2021.

Higher interest rates mean higher net interest margins and with the economy now coming off a slowdown and with better liquidity levels in the market, banking shares have performed well today,  said a Riyadh-based fund manager. Saudi Arabia tends to follow U.S. interest rate moves because its currency is pegged to the dollar. Nine of the 12 listed lenders rose, helping lift the Saudi stock index 0.5 percent. In terms of valuations, banks are trading at a slight discount to the Saudi market and are considered cheap when compared to their regional counterparts, according to analysts at HSBC. They said Saudi banks would also be important financial intermediaries in Riyadh's privatisation programme, which is at the centre of Saudi economic reform plans.  If 70 to 100 percent of such volumes are funded by the banks over a three-year period, sector loan growth could improve by 7 to 9 percentage points,  said HSBC. National Commercial Bank rose 2.9 percent to 44 riyals. HSBC rates the stock a  buy  with a target of 47 riyals. Qatar's index, beaten down in recent days by other Gulf states' economic sanctions against the country, rebounded 1 percent in a broad rally. Qatar National Bank rose 0.6 percent. Foreign funds remained net sellers on Wednesday but their pace of selling has been slowing since last week. Non-Qatari Gulf investors remained net sellers. The index is down 7.4 percent since the sanctions were launched on Monday last week. Uae, Egypt Abu Dhabi's index was almost flat as Dana Gas fell 1.4 percent in heavy trade to 0.68 dirham, off an intra-day high of 0.77 dirham. The stock had surged 15 percent on Tuesday, when Dana proposed restructuring its $700 million of outstanding Islamic bonds at much cheaper rates and without the option of converting to shares. On Wednesday, it said it had obtained an injunction in a Sharjah court blocking claims on its existing sukuk. Dubai's index rose 0.3 percent as theme park operator DXB Entertainments, which has been hit by disappointing visitor numbers at its parks, climbed 5.5 percent after announcing a new management structure. It said strategy and business development would be incorporated into a newly structured finance function, and appointed a new chief financial officer, John Ireland, who was previously CFO at Arab Media Group.

Previously unreported court documents reviewed by Reuters from an ongoing U.S. legal case against Monsanto show that Blair knew the unpublished research found no evidence of a link between glyphosate and cancer. In a sworn deposition given in March this year in connection with the case, Blair also said the data would have altered IARC's analysis. He said it would have made it less likely that glyphosate would meet the agency's criteria for being classed as  probably carcinogenic.  But IARC, a semi-autonomous part of the World Health Organization, never got to consider the data. The agency's rules on assessing substances for carcinogenicity say it can consider only published research â and this new data, which came from a large American study on which Blair was a senior researcher, had not been published. The lack of publication has sparked debate and contention. A leading U.S. epidemiologist and a leading UK statistician â both independent of Monsanto â told Reuters the data was strong and relevant and they could see no reason why it had not surfaced. Monsanto told Reuters that the fresh data on glyphosate could and should have been published in time to be considered by IARC, and that the failure to publish it undermined IARC's classification of glyphosate. The legal case against Monsanto, taking place in California, involves 184 individual plaintiffs who cite the IARC assessment and claim exposure to RoundUp gave them cancer. They allege Monsanto failed to warn consumers of the risks. Monsanto denies the allegations. The company also goes beyond saying the fresh data should have been published. It told Reuters the data was deliberately concealed by Blair, but provided no specific evidence of it being hidden. Blair told Reuters the data, which was available two years before IARC assessed glyphosate, was not published in time because there was too much to fit into one scientific paper. Asked whether he deliberately did not publish it to avoid it being considered by IARC, he said that was  absolutely incorrect.  He said a decision not to publish the glyphosate data had been taken  several months  before IARC chose to conduct a review of the chemical. The National Cancer Institute also cited  space constraints  as the reasons why the new data on glyphosate was not published. At Odds The absence of the data from IARC's assessment was important. IARC ended its meeting in 2015 by concluding that glyphosate is a  probable human carcinogen.  It based its finding on  limited evidence  of carcinogenicity in humans and  sufficient evidence  in experimental animals. It said, among other things, that there was a  positive association  between glyphosate and blood cancers called non-Hodgkin lymphoma. IARC told Reuters that, despite the existence of fresh data about glyphosate, it was sticking with its findings. The agency's assessment is at odds with other international regulators who have said the weedkiller is not a carcinogenic risk to humans. It led to a delay in Europe on a decision on whether to re-license or ban EU-wide sales of pesticides containing glyphosate. That decision is still pending. In the meantime, some countries have tightened restrictions on the weedkiller's use in private gardens and public spaces and on crops before harvest. In the United States, a California judge took the IARC assessment into account in a separate legal case in March when ruling that the state can require RoundUp to carry a warning label that it may cause cancer. Monsanto is now facing further litigation from hundreds of plaintiffs across the United States who say glyphosate gave them or their loved ones non-Hodgkin lymphoma, citing the IARC assessment as part of their claims. Yet if the IARC panel experts had been in a position to take into account Blair's fresh data, IARC's analysis of the evidence on glyphosate would have been different, Blair acknowledged in the court documents reviewed by Reuters. The unpublished research came from the Agricultural Health Study, a large and significant study, led by scientists at the U.S. National Cancer Institute, of agricultural workers and their families in the United States. Asked by Monsanto lawyers in March whether the unpublished data showed  no evidence of an association  between exposure to glyphosate and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Blair replied:  Correct.  Asked in the same deposition whether IARC's review of glyphosate would have been different if the missing data had been included, Blair again said:  Correct.   Lawyers had put to him that the addition of the missing data would have  driven the meta-relative risk downward,  and Blair agreed. Scott Partridge, Monsanto's vice president of strategy, told Reuters the IARC glyphosate review  ignored multiple years of additional data from the largest and most comprehensive study on farmer exposure to pesticides and cancer.  The Agricultural Health Study was particularly pertinent, he said, because it examined real-life human exposure to glyphosate, whereas much of the scientific research IARC analyzed involved laboratory tests on rodents. IARC told Reuters that its evaluations follow strict scientific criteria and that its carcinogen classification system  is recognized and used as a reference all around the world.  It reiterated that in the interests of transparency it considers only published data. Reuters asked two independent statistical experts to review the data, which has still not been published, though the National Cancer Institute told Reuters researchers are currently working on an updated analysis of it. Neither of the two experts had seen the data before and both said they had no conflict of interest over glyphosate. David Spiegelhalter, a professor of the Public Understanding of Risk at Britain's University of Cambridge, said there was  no apparent scientific reason  for not publishing the data. Bob Tarone, a retired statistician who worked alongside Blair and others at the National Cancer Institute for 28 years before moving to the for-profit International Epidemiology Institute, said he could find  no ready explanation in terms of the available scientific evidence  for the data not to have been published. Tarone had already raised the issue in a little-noticed paper in the European Journal of Cancer Prevention last year. He wrote that IARC's classification of glyphosate as probably carcinogenic to humans was the result of  a flawed and incomplete summary  of the evidence. In an email to Reuters, IARC declined to say whether Blair informed IARC staff about the unpublished data, whether he should have, and whether that data might have changed IARC's evaluation of glyphosate had it been published in time. The agency said it had no plans to reconsider its assessment of the chemical. Non-Selective Herbicide Glyphosate is what's known as a non-selective herbicide, meaning it kills most plants. Discovered by the Monsanto chemist John E. Franz in 1970, glyphosate is no longer under patent, is supplied by numerous companies and is now the world's most widely used weedkiller, deployed in agriculture, forestry and domestic gardening. Monsanto and other companies have developed genetically engineered seeds that can tolerate glyphosate, allowing farmers to apply it to entire fields without destroying crops. The safety of the chemical has been under scientific and regulatory scrutiny since the 1980s. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and other international bodies, including the European Food Safety Authority, Health Canada's Pest Management Regulatory Agency, New Zealand's Environmental Protection Authority and Japan's Food Safety Commission, have kept it under regular review, and all say glyphosate is unlikely to cause cancer in humans. But it is not settled science, and researchers across the world continue to study glyphosate - measuring traces of it in water and foods, exposing lab rats to it, and monitoring possible health effects in people who have used it year after year in their work. FILE PHOTO: Rows of corn wait to be harvested in a field in Minooka, Illinois, September 24, 2014.  To match Special Report GLYPHOSATE-CANCER/DATAJim Young/File PhotoOne of the largest and most highly regarded studies to examine effects of pesticide use in real life is the Agricultural Health Study, a prospective investigation of about 89,000 agricultural workers, farmers and their families in Iowa and North Carolina. Since the early 1990s, it has gathered and analyzed detailed information on the health of participants and their families, and their use of pesticides, including glyphosate. AHS researchers have published numerous studies from their data. One paper looking at glyphosate and possible links with cancers was published in 2005. It concluded that  glyphosate exposure was not associated with cancer incidence overall.  Since then, more data has been collected, adding statistical power to subsequent AHS analyses. In early 2013, Blair and other researchers began preparing new papers with updated AHS data on lymphoma and pesticides, including data on glyphosate. Reuters reviewed drafts dated February 2013 and March 2013, and asked Spiegelhalter and Tarone to examine them. They said the papers, while still in the editing process, were in relatively advanced manuscript form. The drafts contain notes in the margin and suggested changes signed  AEB,  Blair's full initials. After studying the draft papers, Tarone said the unpublished figures show  absolutely no evidence whatsoever  of an increased risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma because of exposure to glyphosate. Spiegelhalter told Reuters:  In the drafts I saw, none of the herbicides, including glyphosate, showed any evidence of a relation  with non-Hodgkin lymphoma. He noted that the study was statistically strong enough to show a relationship for other pesticides - so had there been any link to glyphosate, it should have shown up. In his legal testimony, Blair also described the Agricultural Health Study as  powerful  and agreed the data showed no link. But these draft papers were never published, even though Blair told Monsanto's lawyers in March that the Agricultural Health Study was robust and statistically well-powered, and told Reuters the research was important for science and the public. Email exchanges between Blair and his fellow researchers in 2014 also show they were keenly aware there would be scientific and public interest in fresh AHS data. On February 28, 2014, Michael Alavanja, a co-lead author of one of the draft papers, sent an email to another AHS co-researcher, copying the message to Blair. It noted that the research was  important to science, public health, IARC and EPA  - the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. In the same email, Alavanja referred to the findings on non-Hodgkin lymphoma, or NHL. He wrote:  It would be irresponsible if we didn't seek publication of our NHL manuscript in time to influence IARCs (sic) decision.  Slideshow (4 Images)Yet the new AHS data on glyphosate and lymphoma did not surface. Instead, a revised version of one of the 2013 draft papers prepared by Blair and other researchers appeared in a journal called PLoS One in October 2014. It did not include the data on herbicides, of which glyphosate is one. This was unusual. Since 2003 AHS researchers had published at least 10 papers using different rounds of updated data to explore possible links between pesticides and specific diseases. And each one included all four pesticide classes: fungicides, fumigants, insecticides and herbicides. Alavanja was one of the authors of the paper published in PLoS One in 2014. He said he and other authors and senior scientists at the National Cancer Institute decided to remove herbicides from that analysis primarily because of  the issue of statistical power and the need for a comprehensive evaluation of glyphosate and all cancers.  Blair told Reuters the data on herbicides, including glyphosate, had been removed  to make the paper a more manageable size.  He gave a similar answer to the lawyer acting for Monsanto, who repeatedly asked in the legal deposition why the data was not published. Blair testified that the paper  went through many iterations.  He said he could not recall when the glyphosate data was removed, but  we decided to remove it because ... you couldn't put it all into one paper.  Monsanto argues that the data was not published because it showed no link between glyphosate and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Tarone said the absence of herbicide data in the published 2014 paper was  inexplicable,  noting that volume of data had not been an issue in any previous published papers. He said updated AHS data and analyses on herbicides  should be published as soon as possible  to allow  a more complete evaluation of the possible association between glyphosate exposure and NHL risk in humans.  Reuters asked nine other scientists listed as authors on the two draft papers of 2013 why these drafts had never been published. Some were unavailable for comment, and others referred questions to Laura Beane Freeman, who was a co-author on the draft papers and on the 2014 PLoS published study, and is the National Cancer Institute's current principal investigator of the AHS. In an email to Reuters, Freeman and a spokesman for the institute said:  After reviewing early drafts of the manuscript, it became clear that it would be impossible to do a thorough evaluation of all major pesticide groupings due to the sheer volume of information that was important to include.  They said the decision to separate the results for herbicides, including glyphosate, allowed the scientists  to present more thorough evaluations  of the remaining pesticides.  An updated study on glyphosate is under way, Freeman said. Culture Clash Despite IARC's modest size and budget, its monographs - assessments of whether something is a cause of cancer - often catch the eyes and ears of policymakers and the public. Recent IARC monographs have included judgments that red meat is carcinogenic and should be classified alongside arsenic and smoking, and that coffee, which IARC previously said might cause cancer, probably is not carcinogenic. The agency takes a different approach to many other regulators in two important ways. First, it says it assesses  hazard  â the strength of evidence about whether a substance or activity can cause cancer in any way, whether in a laboratory experiment or elsewhere. It does not assess the  risk  or likelihood of a person getting cancer from everyday exposure to something. Second, in general it only considers research that has been published in peer-reviewed scientific journals. IARC considered around 1,000 published studies in its evaluation of glyphosate. But only a handful of those were cohort studies in humans â the kind like the Agricultural Health Study and the most relevant to real-life situations such as people working with glyphosate in agriculture. The differing judgments on glyphosate by IARC and other regulators have stoked clashes on both sides of the Atlantic.  In the United States members of Congress have launched investigations into American taxpayer funding of IARC. They have yet to reach any conclusions. In Europe, the battle centers on the looming decision about whether to re-license glyphosate for use in the European Union. The European Commission has said it wants EU member states to come to a decision by the end of 2017. Politicians will need to weigh the opinions of IARC and other scientific bodies when they decide whether or not to accept a Commission proposal to extend glyphosate's marketing license by 10 years. It remains unclear whether the AHS data will see the light of day in time to be considered. Blair said he thought publishing the glyphosate data would be important and that his former colleagues at the NCI were working on it. The NCI's Freeman said her team is currently  drafting a manuscript on this topic.  She said the new study  will explore the effects of glyphosate exposure in greater depth than a publication that includes multiple pesticides  and would, she hoped, be submitted  to a peer-reviewed journal in the coming months.  Alavanja said a draft paper  should be available for submission to an appropriate scientific journal sometime later this year,  but that a publication date  is very difficult to predict.

Argan Capital and Partners Group Holding hired Lazard last year to cash out of the business, sources said. Delsey, which was valued at around 200 million euros ($224 million), drew interest from Bahrain-based Investcorp and Chinese investment firm Primavera Capital, said the sources, who declined to be identified as the process is private. Others interested in Delsey, which was launched in 1946 and competes with the likes of Rimowa and Samsonite, included CDH Investments from China and IHC from India, according to one of the sources. Argan, Partners, Lazard, Investcop and CDH declined to comment while Delsey, Primavera and IHC could not immediately be reached. The sources said the main reason Delsey's owners pulled the plug was a gap in valuation for the company, which has 25 million euros of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA). Private equity firms face a challenge in deploying the record sums of cash they have raised at a time when sellers' expectations are boosted by high market valuations. For example, Samsonite and handbag maker Coach, which are much bigger than Delsey, both trade at around 20 times earnings, according to Reuters data. Last week, private equity firms, including Investindustrial, CVC and CCMP lost out on Body Shop, a unit of French cosmetics giant L'Oreal, to Brazil's Natura Cosmeticos , sources said, citing pricing challenges. Natura agreed to pay $1.1 billion for the retailer. Globally, private equity firms are sitting on $911.4 billion, having raised $205.5 billion in funds so far this year, according to market data provider Preqin, which said that if the current pace of fundraising continues, 2017 will match the pre-crisis level of 2007, the highest year ever.

Most Russian oil output comes from western Siberia, where fields are depleting, pushing firms to look for new regions. Sanctions complicate the process, barring Western firms from helping with Arctic offshore, deepwater and shale oil projects. Russia is producing almost 11 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude, slightly down from its peaks last year as the country has joined OPEC and some other non-OPEC nations in an output cut that runs to March to stabilize global crude prices. <O/RUS1> Of the 480 billion roubles allocated for offshore projects by Rosneft and its partners, the Russian company planned to invest 250 billion roubles in Arctic offshore between 2017 and 2021, the state-controlled firm wrote in response to Reuters questions.  Development of hydrocarbon resources on the continental Arctic shelf is the future of global oil production and one of the key strategic priorities for the company,  Rosneft, the world's biggest listed oil company by output, said in an email.  It said the Arctic offshore area was expected to account for between 20 and 30 percent of Russian production by 2050.  Rosneft did not mention which partners would be involved in the investments. It said it had licences for 55 offshore blocks in Russia's Arctic, Far East and southern regions, which are believed to contain oil and gas resources.    Andrey Polishchyuk, an analyst with Raiffeisenbank in Moscow, said the allocated sum was big enough for exploration drilling, though actual production could be years away.  I would not look at the actual timing of the production launch at the offshore projects, I would rather look at the oil price and feasibility of those projects,  he said.  For now, Rosneft has been engaging in exploration drilling in the Arctic, and this is right as sooner or later those resources will be needed.  He also said Rosneft needed to focus on onshore oilfields, such as East Siberia's Vankor, one of its key production clusters. The firm has sought tie-ups with several global oil players to develop Russia's offshore regions. But a deal to work in the Arctic Kara Sea with U.S. company Exxon Mobil was suspended in 2014 after the imposition of Western sanctions. Rosneft said in its email that it planned to return to operations in the Kara Sea in 2019 but did not specify whether it would work alone or with a partner.  The Russian company also has deals for offshore work with Norway's Statoil, Italy's Eni and other firms. Rosneft, Exxon, Japan's Sakhalin Oil and Gas Development Co Ltd (SODECO) and India's ONGC are partners in the Sakhalin 1 project off Russia's far east coast. So far, Russia's sole Arctic offshore oilfield is Prirazlomnoye in the Pechora Sea operated by Gazprom Neft, where production is gradually rising from about 40,000 bpd last year.  Rosneft also said it planned preparation work next year at the Wild Orchid gas condensate field in Vietnam at Block 06.1. It did not say when production would start.

Paulo said on Wednesday. Anatel President Juarez Quadros told Estado that the request had been presented to the judge in charge of Oi's bankruptcy protection case last Friday. The debt corresponds to back fines and levies that Oi failed to honor before filing for creditor protection on June 20 last year. According to Estado, Quadros said excluding the Anatel debt from the Oi process will prevent the agency from accepting losses that often go north of 70 percent in similar cases. Oi Chief Executive Officer Marco Schroeder told Reuters on June 9 that he will present an amended restructuring plan this month and put it to vote at an assembly of creditors by around September.

Her community of a few dozen residents live in hand-built wooden houses with no electricity or running water in the world's largest rainforest, more than six hours by river boat from the nearest town in Brazil's southwestern Amazonas State.  Residents in isolated Amazon settlements say they have few opportunities to make a living other than clearing land to raise cattle - part of the reason why Amazon deforestation rates in Brazil shot up 29 percent last year after years of decline.  As well as villagers clearing land to feed themselves, large ranchers and speculators have been trying to invade the Arapixi nature reserve where Oliveira lives to cut down trees, an official with Brazil's environment ministry said.  But residents of the reserve have new ally to help them protect the trees - chocolate.  This is virgin forest,  Oliveira, 62, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation as residents used long poles to knock cocoa beans - the base ingredient for chocolate - from the reserve's trees.  Some guys came to cut the trees down a while back - but we told them to get lost,  Oliveira said, as other farmers carried fresh cocoa beans to dry in the sun.   If we had let them, we wouldn't have an income source... cocoa helps us protect the forest.  Farmers in the nature reserve work with a local cooperative in Boca do Acre that manages the sale and export of the cocoa.  Finding a Balance     Finding a balance between employment for local people and protecting Amazonian forests has long stumped policymakers.  Every minute, forests larger than two football fields are felled in the Amazon, according to the former director of Brazil's forestry service.  Brazilian officials say projects like the cocoa co-op are helping residents make a living from the land while moving away from deforestation.   These cocoa projects come from the community, we are a partner with them,  said Abilio Ikeziri, an official at Brazil's environment ministry, responsible for protected areas.  The income also helps locals keep the ranchers and land scammers out of the reserve, Ikeziri said.   I am the only (official) responsible for looking after 1.5 million hectares (15,000 km sq) of land - it is impossible (without local help),  he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.    Communities living in the reserve and making a living from sustainably harvesting plants like cocoa that grow naturally makes it easier for over-stretched officials to defend the land from speculators, the official said.  Cooperative Solutions In the Arapixi reserve, residents used to harvest cocoa for their own consumption and began selling it to a cooperative 10 years ago.  Last year they exported more than 10 tonnes of natural cocoa to Europe which earned the co-op about 130,000 reis ($39,000), a decline from previous years due to poor weather.  Once it arrives in Germany the cocoa is refined into high-end, environmentally certified chocolate.  Based in the Amazon river port of Boca do Acre the co-op employs more than 400 people, including a dozen in Dona Oliveira's community, said manager Jose Geraldo Tranin.  Before we launched the co-op, many people were deforesting land for cattle,  Tranin told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in the co-op's sparse one room office in Boca do Acre.  Now people know cocoa will generate some income so they are preserving the forest.  With help from German social entrepreneurs who provided money to buy boats and other capital for the co-operative to get started, reserve residents like Oliveira were given training in cocoa production and tools to better harvest and transport the crop.   The co-op wants to expand, so that is good for us,  said 52-year-old farmer Jose Freitas, taking a break from racking cocoa beans over a metal grate in the sun.  Backed by Research Residents can earn up to 1,200 reais ($365) per month in the busy season preparing the beans for export - a decent salary in a region beset by poverty - although it means working seven days per week.   We can buy more food now,  Freitas said.  I could even afford to make the trip to the hospital.   For European consumers, their chocolate is branded as  wild cocoa of Amazonas .   The project has had a clear impact on forest preservation in Arapixi compared to similar Amazon reserves, said Francidalva Oliveira de Souza, a researcher at the State University of Amazonas studying the project.   Deforestation has been decreasing in this reserve,  Souza told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in a phone interview.  This sort of project could be expanded to help preserve other areas and help residents earn an income.

The views expressed are his own) * Chart 1: tmsnrt.rs/2srWKEf * Chart 2: tmsnrt.rs/2ssekIv By John Kemp LONDON, June 14 (Reuters) - The oil market is on an unsustainable course with output from U.S. shale and other non-OPEC sources increasing rapidly, while OPEC and its allies trim production to reduce inventories and prop up prices. The International Energy Agency (IEA) projects non-OPEC output will increase by 1.5 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2018 (âOil Market Reportâ, IEA, June 2017). If that proves correct, non-OPEC suppliers will capture all the increase in demand next year, because the IEA predicts consumption will increase by only 1.4 million bpd. In effect, OPEC will be restricting its own output only to see rival producers step in to meet growing demand from refiners. OPEC will face the familiar dilemma of whether to defend oil prices by continuing to restrict output or defend market share by growing production again. OPEC and its non-OPEC allies are unlikely to remain impassive as U.S. shale producers and other non-OPEC countries not bound by the production agreement capture all the growth in market demand in 2018. If U.S. shale production continues to grow rapidly, OPEC will probably return to defending its market share in 2018, even if it means accepting lower oil prices. Switching Tack OPECâs strategy can best be described as a cycle alternating between prioritising price protection and defending market share. Between 2012 and the middle of 2014, the organisationâs members complacently enjoyed high prices but ceded market share to the U.S. shale sector and other non-OPEC producers including deepwater projects. OPECâs share of the market shrank progressively from 43.5 percent in 2012 to 41.2 percent in 2014, the lowest since 2006, according to BP (âStatistical Review of World Energyâ, BP, 2017). If the shale boom had continued, with U.S. production growing at more than 1 million bpd per year, OPECâs share would have fallen even further in 2015 and 2016 (tmsnrt.rs/2srWKEf). So OPEC, under the leadership of Saudi Arabia, refused to cut production and allowed oil prices to fall to curb the shale boom and deepwater projects, which was the only rational strategy under the circumstances. Between mid-2014 and mid-2016, OPECâs strategy switched to protecting its market share and allowing oil prices to sink. OPECâs market defence strategy appears to have been successful, with its share of output climbing from 41.2 percent in 2014 to 42.7 percent in 2016. But the cost proved more painful than anticipated, with oil prices slumping from an average of $100 per barrel in 2014 to less than $45 in 2016. In the second half of 2016, OPEC switched tack again, and abandoned its market share strategy in favour of a return to price defence. Prices have risen but OPECâs share of production is set to decline once more in both 2017 and 2018, which could force another change of strategy. Shale Rebound The resurgence of U.S. shale is already complicating OPECâs efforts to draw down global stocks in 2017, as well as threatening its market share in 2018. The speed and scale at which U.S. shale production has bounced back from the slump in 2015/16 has confounded OPEC and all the other major forecasters. OPEC wrote in its latest oil market assessment that rebalancing is underway but at a slower pace because of the âshift in U.S. supply from an expected contraction to positive growth.â OPEC now predicts U.S. oil production will increase by 800,000 bpd in 2017, compared with a projected decline of 150,000 bpd at the time of its December forecast (âMonthly Oil Market Reportâ, OPEC, June 2017). The International Energy Agency is forecasting U.S. crude and condensates production to increase by 620,000 bpd in 2017, compared with a prediction that output would be flat in its November assessment. And the U.S. Energy Information Administration has raised its prediction for U.S. output growth in 2017 to 460,000 bpd from a predicted decline of 80,000 bpd in December. Stein and Shale At this point in the cycle, it may be time for OPEC and U.S. shale drillers to heed Stein's Law. âIf something cannot continue forever, it will stop,â wrote Herbert Stein, chief economist to U.S. President Richard Nixon. His law is arguably the most important insight in economics but it is amazing how frequently it is forgotten (âWhat I think: essays on economics, politics and lifeâ, Stein, 1998). U.S. oil producers have added more than 400 extra rigs since the end of May 2016 in response to higher oil prices. But the increase in U.S. production is now threatening to overwhelm the market, in a re-run of the situation in 2014 that led to the price collapse. The U.S. Energy Information Administration projects U.S. production will rise by a further 680,000 bpd in 2018. The International Energy Agency is predicting an even larger increase. Most forecasters are bullish about the outlook for oil demand growth in 2018. Even so, output from U.S. shale and other non-OPEC sources will essentially capture the entire gain. The implied erosion of OPECâs market share is unlikely to be sustainable, and following Steinâs Law, it will stop. The correction is likely to come from lower oil prices, which will have to fall low enough for long enough to bring the boom back under control. Benchmark U.S. crude prices have already declined by $9 per barrel or about 16 percent from their recent peak in the middle of February. Shale producers have continued to add rigs even as prices have fallen because most of their production for 2017 had already been hedged at higher price levels (tmsnrt.rs/2ssekIv). Shale firms have also benefited from plentiful funding from private equity investors with a relatively long-term view on the market. But most producers have only hedged a relatively low proportion of output for 2018 so far, and the patience of private equity investors will not last forever. Crude prices will need to remain relatively low until more of the hedges have expired, private equity funding has slowed and drilling moderates to a more sustainable pace. Many U.S. shale producers insist they can drill wells profitably at prices well below $50 per barrel and in some cases below $40. There may be an element of bravado in some of these claims which may exclude certain costs and apply only to the most productive wells in the most promising locations. In any case, the oil market is already testing the shale drillers' resolve. Oil prices are likely to remain weak until there are signs that U.S. drilling and future production are shifting onto a more sustainable trajectory.

Private equity group SVPGlobal announced it would combine the two packaging firms in April intending to increase their clout ahead of a planned stock market listing. SVP put UK-based Linpac up for sale last year, but after failing to find a buyer at its asking price, chose to merge it with Kloeckner. Credit Suisse and Rabobank are leading the financing that comprises a â¬1.58bn five-year covenant-lite dual-currency term loan split between a â¬725m first-lien term loan and an â¬855m-equivalent dollar-denominated term loan. The company also intends to raise â¬385m of six-year notes at a holding company level, banking sources said. The notes are likely to launch towards the end of the loan syndication, so the financing of the two asset classes closes at the same time, the sources said. Lenders have been asked to commit to the loan financing by June 27. The euro-denominated loan is guided to pay 400bp-425bp over Euribor with a 0% floor and a 99 OID, while the dollar loan is guided at 350bp-375bp over Libor with a 1% floor and a 99 OID. The financing will repay existing debt of â¬1.4bn including â¬105m of Linpacâs existing debt; use â¬135m to fund the acquisition; pay â¬426 as a dividend; and pay â¬66m on transaction fees and expenses, the sources said. Some â¬130m will be left as cash on the balance sheet post transaction, the sources said. The financing will also include a 4.5-year revolving credit facility, paying 300bp over Euribor with a 0% floor. A five-year term loan maturity bucks the standard seven-year term loan maturity in Europeâs leveraged loan market and is being used to target CLO investors conscious of the weighted average life of their CLO vehicles, the sources said. There is also no need for such a long term loan given the company intends to float, the sources said. âWith every intention to IPO the business, Kloeckner does not need such a long financing as the owners will be out shorter than a typical sponsor would hold for. Five years should be helpful for the weighted average life of CLOs and in theory the borrower should get better pricing for that. If anything the pricing is a little generous in terms of where the market is at the moment,â a banker said. The deal is expected to receive a B2/B corporate and issue rating. SVPGlobal was not immediately available to comment. SVP acquired Kloeckner Pentaplast from private equity firm Blackstone following a lengthy restructuring. Blackstone had bought the company from Cinven in 2007, backed by â¬1.25bn of leveraged loans. The buyout group took control of Linpac in late 2014 after buying up large chunks of debt related to a 2003 takeover of Linpac by private equity group Montagu for Â£860m, which had been backed by a Â£600m loan.

The guidelines came after complaints by investors earlier this year that some funds with  Hong Kong  in their product names actually had little exposure to the stocks there. In a document obtained by Reuters on Wednesday, the guidelines also require fund managers with substantial Hong Kong experience to manage the Hong Kong-labeled products.  The guidelines, which the China Securities Regulatory Commission issued to domestic fund houses, could accelerate mainland money flows into Hong Kong as fund houses rush to launch funds that invest in one of the world's best-performing markets so far this year. Li Kai, vice head of product development at First Seafront Fund Management Co, which received the guidelines, said that although the rules apply to new funds, regulators may also ask existing funds to renew their registration and meet new asset allocation requirements. Currently, over 100 mutual funds in China have  Hong Kong  in their names. China's institutional and retail investors can now invest in Hong Kong stocks via the cross-border Stock Connect schemes. The new schemes have channeled steady inflows of mainland money, which helped push Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng Index to the highest level in nearly two years. The guidelines also require that Hong Kong-focused funds have at least two employees, one of whom has to be a fund manger, who have at least two years of investment management experience in Hong Kong. Under the new rules, Chinese mutual funds without  Hong Kong  in their names must not invest over 50 percent of their equity assets in Hong Kong stocks, the documents showed.

Product endorsements have become more common on Instagram, owned by Facebook Inc, as celebrities and others with large followings on the social network have struck deals to talk up clothing, food and other items.  Known inside the industry as  influencers,  people promoting products are required under truth-in-advertising rules to tell fans about their compensation, according to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC). It is not clear how many do.  Instagram said in a statement that it would begin allowing people who are posting a picture to add a  paid partnership with  label that would appear above the picture. Users can already add such disclosures below a picture.   As more and more partnerships form on Instagram, it's important to ensure the community is able to easily recognize when someone they follow is paid to post content,  the company said. The label would be voluntary, Instagram said. The company added, though, that it expects the label to be used because some users requested it.  Instagram said it would develop a policy about paid endorsements based in part on the feedback it gets about the label. The policy would include some kind of enforcement but the details are still to be determined, the company said.  The FTC, the chief enforcer of U.S. truth-in-advertising rules, has sent letters to more than 35 stars and more than 40 companies telling them they must disclose compensation for promoting products on social media. As advertising has migrated from television and print publications to social media, it has become increasingly difficult to distinguish from non-advertising content. The FTC settled with retailer Lord & Taylor in 2016 over social media posts by select  fashion influencers  who put up photos of a paisley dress. As part of the settlement, Lord & Taylor agreed to ensure that future paid posts would be identified.

Her community of a few dozen residents live in hand-built wooden houses with no electricity or running water in the world's largest rainforest, more than six hours by river boat from the nearest town in Brazil's southwestern Amazonas State.  Residents in isolated Amazon settlements say they have few opportunities to make a living other than clearing land to raise cattle - part of the reason why Amazon deforestation rates in Brazil shot up 29 percent last year after years of decline.  As well as villagers clearing land to feed themselves, large ranchers and speculators have been trying to invade the Arapixi nature reserve where Oliveira lives to cut down trees, an official with Brazil's environment ministry said.  But residents of the reserve have new ally to help them protect the trees - chocolate.  This is virgin forest,  Oliveira, 62, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation as residents used long poles to knock cocoa beans - the base ingredient for chocolate - from the reserve's trees.  Some guys came to cut the trees down a while back - but we told them to get lost,  Oliveira said, as other farmers carried fresh cocoa beans to dry in the sun.   If we had let them, we wouldn't have an income source... cocoa helps us protect the forest.  Farmers in the nature reserve work with a local cooperative in Boca do Acre that manages the sale and export of the cocoa.  Finding a Balance     Finding a balance between employment for local people and protecting Amazonian forests has long stumped policymakers.  Every minute, forests larger than two football fields are felled in the Amazon, according to the former director of Brazil's forestry service.  Brazilian officials say projects like the cocoa co-op are helping residents make a living from the land while moving away from deforestation.   These cocoa projects come from the community, we are a partner with them,  said Abilio Ikeziri, an official at Brazil's environment ministry, responsible for protected areas.  The income also helps locals keep the ranchers and land scammers out of the reserve, Ikeziri said.   I am the only (official) responsible for looking after 1.5 million hectares (15,000 km sq) of land - it is impossible (without local help),  he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.    Communities living in the reserve and making a living from sustainably harvesting plants like cocoa that grow naturally makes it easier for over-stretched officials to defend the land from speculators, the official said.  Cooperative Solutions In the Arapixi reserve, residents used to harvest cocoa for their own consumption and began selling it to a cooperative 10 years ago.  Last year they exported more than 10 tonnes of natural cocoa to Europe which earned the co-op about 130,000 reis ($39,000), a decline from previous years due to poor weather.  Once it arrives in Germany the cocoa is refined into high-end, environmentally certified chocolate.  Based in the Amazon river port of Boca do Acre the co-op employs more than 400 people, including a dozen in Dona Oliveira's community, said manager Jose Geraldo Tranin.  Before we launched the co-op, many people were deforesting land for cattle,  Tranin told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in the co-op's sparse one room office in Boca do Acre.  Now people know cocoa will generate some income so they are preserving the forest.  With help from German social entrepreneurs who provided money to buy boats and other capital for the co-operative to get started, reserve residents like Oliveira were given training in cocoa production and tools to better harvest and transport the crop.   The co-op wants to expand, so that is good for us,  said 52-year-old farmer Jose Freitas, taking a break from racking cocoa beans over a metal grate in the sun.  Backed by Research Residents can earn up to 1,200 reais ($365) per month in the busy season preparing the beans for export - a decent salary in a region beset by poverty - although it means working seven days per week.   We can buy more food now,  Freitas said.  I could even afford to make the trip to the hospital.   For European consumers, their chocolate is branded as  wild cocoa of Amazonas .   The project has had a clear impact on forest preservation in Arapixi compared to similar Amazon reserves, said Francidalva Oliveira de Souza, a researcher at the State University of Amazonas studying the project.   Deforestation has been decreasing in this reserve,  Souza told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in a phone interview.  This sort of project could be expanded to help preserve other areas and help residents earn an income.

Product endorsements have become more common on Instagram, owned by Facebook Inc, as celebrities and others with large followings on the social network have struck deals to talk up clothing, food and other items.  Known inside the industry as  influencers,  people promoting products are required under truth-in-advertising rules to tell fans about their compensation, according to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC). It is not clear how many do.  Instagram said in a statement that it would begin allowing people who are posting a picture to add a  paid partnership with  label that would appear above the picture. Users can already add such disclosures below a picture.   As more and more partnerships form on Instagram, it's important to ensure the community is able to easily recognize when someone they follow is paid to post content,  the company said. The label would be voluntary, Instagram said. The company added, though, that it expects the label to be used because some users requested it.  Instagram said it would develop a policy about paid endorsements based in part on the feedback it gets about the label. The policy would include some kind of enforcement but the details are still to be determined, the company said.  The FTC, the chief enforcer of U.S. truth-in-advertising rules, has sent letters to more than 35 stars and more than 40 companies telling them they must disclose compensation for promoting products on social media. As advertising has migrated from television and print publications to social media, it has become increasingly difficult to distinguish from non-advertising content. The FTC settled with retailer Lord & Taylor in 2016 over social media posts by select  fashion influencers  who put up photos of a paisley dress. As part of the settlement, Lord & Taylor agreed to ensure that future paid posts would be identified.

The previous interim government in Sofia had said talks should start with Sweden for the purchase of eight Gripen aircraft, but current Prime Minister Boyko Borissov has cast doubts on whether Sofia should rush into a deal, estimated at 1.5 billion levs ($860 million). The defense ministry, looking to replace ageing MiG-29 aircraft, had picked the Swedish jet over an offer from Portugal and the United States for second-hand U.S. F-16s and an Italian offer of second-hand Eurofighter Typhoons.  What we hope and expect is that we would be called to negotiate ... probably after the summer break,  Magnus Lewis-Olsson, Saab's head of Europe, told reporters in Sofia.   If Bulgaria wants their aircraft in quite quickly then obviously we hope negotiations (are going) to start soon because we've got to build the aircraft as well,  he said. Bulgarian officials say the country, a member of the European Union and NATO, should move ahead simultaneously with buying new ships and armored vehicles for its army, and that would require significant financial resources. Lewis-Olsson said Saab was ready to discuss different financing options, including payments over a long period, and would be prepared to provide about 4 fighter jets in 18 months upon signing.  This is something that is going to last for 40 years, it is a cost for a country for a long time, so we are prepared to discuss how we finance it,  he said. Last month Saab, which has provided Gripen warplanes to Hungary and the Czech Republic, said it hoped Croatia could enter the market for fighter jets soon and that it would hold talks with Slovakia over new aircraft.

The election of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) three years ago has emboldened right-wing Hindu groups to push harder for protection of the cow, an animal they consider sacred. Authorities in India's most populous state, Uttar Pradesh, started closing down unlicensed abattoirs in March, immediately hitting production and sales in the Muslim-dominated meat industry. Last month Modi's government also banned trading cattle for slaughter, including not just cows, whose killing was already outlawed in most states, but also buffalo, an animal used for meat and leather. Now the squeeze is spreading to others in the Muslim minority and to lower-caste Hindus who cart cattle, labour in tanneries and make shoes, bags and belts - including for big name brands such as Zara and Clarks. Frequent attacks by right-wing Hindus against workers they accuse of harming cattle have further rattled the industry. Social Tensions Much of India's meat and leather trade takes place in the informal economy, meaning the impact of the closing of illegal abattoirs and ban on trading for slaughter is hard to measure. But cattle markets are reporting a big slowdown in trade and tanneries a shortage of hides. Abdul Faheem Qureshi, a representative of India's Muslim Qureshi community of butchers, said in Uttar Pradesh some markets trading 1,000 animals last year were now down to as few as 100. The decline in production means fewer jobs for two of India's poorest communities, and risks inflaming social tensions at a time when Modi has vowed to boost employment and accelerate economic growth ahead of the next general election in 2019. Some large leather manufacturers support the Uttar Pradesh state government's move, arguing that allowing only licensed abattoirs to operate will clean the industry's image. Bigger exporters also say they have enough leather as they source hides widely, including from abroad. Still, millions work in the meat and leather industries, which are worth more than $16 billion in annual sales. When Reuters visited the narrow shoemaking lanes of Agra a crowd of Muslims breaking their Ramadan fast gathered, shouting angrily that they were no longer safe to trade buffalo, buy cow leather for shoes or to do work that their community has done for centuries for fear of being attacked by Hindu vigilantes.  They want to weaken us. They want to snatch our bread,  says 66-year-old Mohammad Muqeem, whose workers stitch $3 shoes in his cellar, referring to the closure of slaughterhouses and recent attacks on cattle traders. Muqeem's monthly income has halved to $300 since last year as leather has become scarce. His dozen casual workers, down from 40, now use mostly synthetic materials. Impossible Target Like meat, India's leather industry has expanded rapidly in the last decade, providing relatively well-paid factory work and cash for families stitching informally in their homes. Agra, in Uttar Pradesh, turns out a million pairs of shoes a day for domestic buyers and European labels such as Inditex-owned Zara and Clarks. An estimated 40 percent of the population of the northern Indian city, famed as the home of the Taj Mahal, depends on the industry. Clarks said in a statement that it does not use leather from Indian-origin cows and that the small amount of buffalo leather it sources from India had not been impacted. Zara and did not respond to requests for comment. India is one of the world's top five producers of leather, with skins coming from cows that die of natural causes or from the legal slaughter of buffalo. Modi's government is targeting leather revenues of $27 billion - more than double today's level - by 2020 as part of a job creation push. But in May, the government decreed that animal markets could only trade cow and buffalo for agricultural purposes such as ploughing and dairy production - a move many in the industry say contradicts its plans to grow leather sales. India's environment minister said this week the government could amend the rule after a court temporarily stayed the order and there was widespread anger in regions where meat and leather are important to the local culture and economy. But industry officials said the shock of the ban, coming on the heels of the crackdown on abattoirs and attacks against cattle workers, meant business would not easily recover. Companies say the government's leather target would be impossible to meet unless the restrictions are reversed.  There is a lot of panic in the industry after the latest order, which has come as the biggest blow,  Puran Dawar, chairman of Agra-based exporter Dawar Footwear Industries, said as hundreds of workers moulded shoes on the factory floor, referring to the ban on cattle traded for slaughter.  There are grave concerns about the supply of leather, exports of shoes and overall employment.  India's commerce ministry did not respond to requests for comment. In Uttar Pradesh, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, a controversial Hindu priest, had made closing unlicensed slaughter houses a priority after Modi appointed him in March. About 30 percent of hides, mostly from buffaloes, that supply tanneries in the state are from unlicensed abattoirs. Sitting in his one-room shop in Agra's leather market, Mohammad Hashim, a burly leather dealer in his sixties, said business was down 40 percent in the last three months. The recent scarcity of hides had hurt Hindus as much as Muslims, he said, pointing to the quiet streets outside and a Hindu man struggling to sell puffed rice snacks from his cart. Modi's election in 2014 and a resurgence in right-wing Hindu activism have increased concerns among Muslims that their livelihoods are under attack. As a minority making up 14 percent of India's 1.3 billion people, they are generally poorer and less literate than majority Hindus. When worshippers finishing evening prayers at the Mughal-era mosque in the shoemaking quarter of Agra are asked whether the chief minister handpicked by Modi is to blame, one of the Imams thunders:  Modi is to blame. He is targeting Muslims.  In an interview with Reuters, Chief Minister Adityanath rejected accusations the BJP had targeted any specific group.  Illegal slaughterhouses operated across the state and many big and small leather traders were buying raw material at cheapest rates from unlicensed slaughterhouses to maximise profits,  he said in Lucknow, the state capital. Wider Industry Hit In the industrial city of Kanpur, 250 km (155 miles) east of Agra, tanneries processing buffalo skins are reporting job losses as the availability of hides dries up. Nayyar Jamal, general secretary of Kanpur's Small Tanners' Association, reckons as many as 400,000 employees in Kanpur's leather and related industries are temporarily jobless, including some laid off because of environmental curbs on tannery pollution. Supplies of local hides have dropped by 20 to 30 percent. Qureshi, from the butchers' organisation, estimates that 3.5 million employees in Uttar Pradesh alone have been directly hit.  More than the economic loss, the government has injected fear,  said Chandra Bhan Prasad, a writer and businessman from the Dalit community, as those at the bottom of Hinduism's social hierarchy once called  untouchables  are known. Dalits and Muslims often work in trades that higher-caste Hindus traditionally consider beneath them. Tannery owner Mohammad Ikram said he was only able to procure 4,000 hides a month - down from 25,000 - because even truckers transporting legally obtained cow or buffalo hides fear attacks from vigilantes. He has a month's inventory left, and when that runs out he will have to start shedding staff. Shahnawaz Qureshi, a wage labourer stuffing synthetic shoes into plastic bags in Muqeem's cellar in Agra, lost his last job after his employer could no longer afford leather. He now earns 3,000 rupees  - or $47 - a month, down from 4,500 in his previous job, and together with his father's income supports three sisters and his mother.  I decided to sign up for this job despite the fact that I earn reasonably less here,  he said.

We're not being complacent about it,  Nestor Espenilla, who takes the helm of the central bank next month, moving from his current role as head of banking supervision, said in an interview. Bank lending in the Southeast Asian nation has been rising at a double-digit pace for at least two years now. In April, it grew an annual 19.2 percent, with the bulk of loans going to real estate, manufacturing and information and communication.  The challenge for an economy like the Philippines is we are in catch up mode, so there is legitimate demand for credit and growth, you cannot suppress that. But one thing done too rapidly may also lead to mistakes,  Espenilla said.  We are closely monitoring these developments. These can lead to problems if credit is supporting businesses that may be more vulnerable to cyclical turns.  The rapid rise in credit growth, along with the double-digit rise in investment growth and a stellar pace of economic expansion, have fueled concerns of overheating and sustainability.  The Philippines remained one of Asia's fastest-growing economies in the first quarter, with gross domestic product rising an annual 6.4 percent, marking 73 quarters of uninterrupted growth. It is targeting growth of between 6.5 percent and 7.5 percent this year. Some economists have said current economic conditions warrant an increase of as much as 50 basis points in interest rates in the second half to tame overheating pressures. But Espenilla said the direction of the central bank's monetary policy would depend on consumer price expectations, and based on its projections, inflation is expected to fall within this year and next year's target of 2 percent to 4 percent.  We are inside the inflation path,  Espenilla said, adding that prices of fuel, energy and food remain well-behaved. Annual inflation eased 3.1 percent in May, to its slowest pace in four months. Espenilla said the Philippine economy was in  good shape  and should stay that way, given the government's big-spending overhaul.  The Philippines is pinning growth plans on higher infrastructure spending to create jobs, stimulate the economy and attract foreign investors put off by high power prices and poor roads and ports. Amid a robust economy and tame inflation, the central bank is likely to keep its benchmark interest rate PHCBIR=ECI steady at 3.0 percent when it holds its next policy meeting on June 22.

Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt cut ties with Qatar and imposed stringent economic sanctions on it, accusing the country of supporting terrorism. Doha denies their accusations that it supports Islamist militants and Shi'ite Iran. The four states, which have branded dozens of people and entities with alleged links to Qatar as terrorists, must respect citizens' rights, Zeid said.  It is becoming clear that the measures being adopted are overly broad in scope and implementation, and have the potential to seriously disrupt the lives of thousands of women, children and men, simply because they belong to one of the nationalities involved in the dispute,  Zeid said in a statement.  He said directives issued by Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Bahrain to address the humanitarian needs of families with joint nationalities appeared to be inadequate, and his office had received reports of specific individuals being ordered to return home or to leave the country they are residing in.  Among those likely to be badly affected are couples in mixed marriages, and their children; people with jobs or businesses based in States other than that of their nationality; and students studying in another country,  he said.  I am also extremely troubled to hear that the UAE and Bahrain are threatening to jail and fine people who express sympathy for Qatar or opposition to their own governmentsâ actions, as this would appear to be a clear violation of the right to freedom of expression or opinion.

The peso fell to its lowest level in history against the dollar on Jan. 19, the day before Trump's inauguration, as traders worried that his campaign pledges to scrap the North American Free Trade Agreement and erect a wall between the two countries would weaken the Mexican economy. But since Trump moved into the White House the peso has been on a tear, rising more than 20 percent against the dollar. It has been the world's best performing major currency so far this year. Rhetoric from Trump's administration has become less corrosive since he took office. This and the Bank of Mexico's aggressive monetary policy, including unexpectedly raising its benchmark interest rate last month to an eight-year high of 6.75 percent, have helped the peso firm to its highest level since Aug. 18. Fund managers told Reuters they largely believe the peso's growth will continue.  (The peso) has had good momentum relative to other emerging currencies in recent months, and that could continue for some time longer,  said Morgan Harting, lead portfolio manager for all multi-asset income strategies at AllianceBernstein.  And though it is no longer cheap, it also does not look expensive in terms of purchasing power parity.  One of the primary factors helping the peso's rise has been the reversal of speculator positions on the currency. Last week, speculators raised the number of net-long contracts on the peso to 84,821, the highest since June 2014.  This is partly due to the changes in U.S. politics, and partly as global economic headwinds have dissipated somewhat â allowing carry trades to flourish again,  said Ken Dickson, investment director, foreign exchange, at Standard Life Investments. Javier Murcio, senior sovereign analyst for emerging market strategies at Standish, a division of Bank of New York Mellon Corp, said the results of recent state elections in which left-wing candidates were unable to unseat traditional powers was also a strong sign. However, he warned the peso was nearing important technical resistance levels at which traders could reduce or reverse their positions.  Chances for further appreciation remain, but as the inflation adjusted exchange rate begins to lose competitiveness, important floors may appear at 18/USD or even 17.75, which are levels at which further gains may be difficult to sustain,  Murcio said in an email. Alejo Czerwonko, an emerging market strategist at UBS Wealth Management, said that while he remains bullish, the peso is nearing the asset manager's target of 18 pesos per dollar. Still, with the U.S. dollar continuing to weaken despite expectations for interest rate increases from the Federal Reserve, investors who hold the peso remain bullish.  As long as the (U.S. dollar) is stable to lower, we believe the currency can continue to appreciate even if the (Mexican) central bank begins to cut rates later this year,  said Jim Barrineau, co-head of emerging markets debt relative at Schroders.

We call upon the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) to declare this an illegal act,  al-Baker said in a statement.  We are not a political body, we are an airline, and this blockade has stripped us of the rights which are guaranteed to us.  Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Bahrain and Egypt cut diplomatic and transport ties with Qatar a week ago, accusing it of fomenting regional unrest, supporting terrorism and getting too close to Iran, all of which Doha denies. State-owned Qatar Airways and other Qatari-owned aircraft are blocked from using the airspace over the four Arab countries. Qatar Airways has said it will continue with plans to add 24 destinations between 2017 and 2018, including two in the next month, despite the restrictions that have forced the airline to fly longer routes to avoid the blocked airspace.  As far as we are concerned, it is business as usual,â al-Baker said. Al-Baker said on Tuesday Qatar Airways would redeploy aircraft it used to fly to Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt to fast track its expansion plans.

EasyJet announced last month that it had arranged to convert part of an Airbus order to larger planes to cut costs per seat, and was also postponing some orders of smaller planes as it reported a bigger-than-expected half year loss. The low-cost airline took delivery of its first A320neo jet on Wednesday, its 300th plane, with new, more fuel efficient engines.  A 15 pct reduction in fuel burn is relevant at any fuel price,  CEO Carolyn McCall said in Toulouse as the A320neo was delivered. She was referring to the fact fuel prices have fallen since the planes were ordered.  We are able to take more A321neos in our framework but we haven't as yet committed to taking any more... It will be on our radar as we go through the next 12-18 months , she said. EasyJet has already switched 30 of its 130 A320neo orders for larger A321neo's, which seat an additional 49 passengers and are set to bring the cost per seat down by 8-9 percent compared with the smaller plane. The engines of the A320neo are made by CFM International, a joint venture between General Electric Co (GE.N) and Safran SA (SAF.PA) of France.  A rival engine made by Pratt & Whitney has suffered hardware and software problems, leading to delivery delays.  My goodness, we're glad we choose CFM,  McCall quipped.     Outlook Improves, Brexit Plans in Place McCall said easyJet had had a good third quarter and that the environment was improving, with rivals not growing as fast as previously.   Over time, that will drive yields,  she told Reuters, referring to a measure of revenue per passenger. Rivals are also switching to bigger planes. Wizz Air (WIZZ.L) is shifting from the 180-seat A320 to A321s which can carry up to 239 passengers. Ryanair (RYA.I) is set to order Boeing's proposed new 737 MAX 10 airliner, which seats up to 230 passengers and is designed to challenge the A321.  EasyJet is likely to use the larger planes to fly out of airports such as London Gatwick, Paris Orly and Amsterdam where it is hard to get new slots. McCall told journalists she had not seen any impact on bookings from recent attacks in London and Manchester and the uncertainty created by last week's UK general election did not alter its own plans. The carrier has applied for an operating licence in an EU member state to allow it to keep flying intra-EU routes once Britain leaves the bloc and it hopes the application will be approved this summer. McCall said meeting EU ownership and control regulations would be no problem after Brexit because it is already 48 percent owned by someone from one of the remaining EU countries, founder Stelios Haji-Ioannou. Elsewhere, easyJet has expressed an interest to administrators looking to sell Alitalia, but McCall said that interested parties had been asked not to comment further.

The New Delta Avengers are named in a nod to the Niger Delta Avengers who last year crippled Nigeria's oil production in a fight for a greater share of the proceeds for the region, impoverished, like much of the country, by endemic corruption. The new group's inaugural statement was signed by a Corporal Oleum Bellum, a Latin phrase that loosely means  oil war . It and others, like the Niger Delta Marine Force led by one General Benikeme Hitler, have formed even as the government holds peace talks with Niger Delta communities to try to end violence that has brought the economy to its knees.  By this declaration, we are resurrecting the spirit of insurgency to demand for a better deal for our people,  the New Delta Avengers' statement said.  We are going to do this through bloody attacks and destruction of oil assets in the creeks and upland areas so as to disrupt and eventually cripple oil prospecting and production operations in the state.  Many groups issue similar statements and never act on their words. But some, like the original Niger Delta Avengers and the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND), did so to devastating effect. At the height of violence last year, Niger Delta militants' attacks cut Nigeria's oil production by as much as a third. That set the economy reeling, as lower crude exports meant less money in government coffers, especially the U.S. dollars Nigeria needs to import essential products and keep businesses running.  Devilish, Hardened Heart  The New Delta Avengers say their main grievance is with the governor of Delta state, Ifeanyi Okowa, who they accuse of diverting funds from programmes meant to benefit Delta state.  Like the biblical Pharaoh, only extraordinary undertakings can soften his devilish and hardened heart towards the oil producing areas of the state,  they said of Okowa. A spokesman for the governor denied the group's accusation that he was  showing nepotism and favouritism in the sharing of government resources . The state government was not in a position to ascertain the credibility of the New Delta Avengers' threats, the spokesman said. The old Avengers suspended their campaign last year to give peace talks a chance after a string of attacks on oil facilities, blowing up even an underwater Shell pipeline. MEND fought an insurgency until 2009, when it agreed with the previous federal government on a ceasefire and amnesty offering salaries and job training for its fighters. Some of its commanders became millionaires with contracts to protect the same pipelines they had been blowing up. Many of the militants have a taste for the dramatic. There was General Busta Rhymes, named for the New York rapper known for his frenetic flow, before Corporal Oleum Bellum and General Benikeme Hitler, who issued an inaugural statement in January. Oil facilities belonging to major international oil companies would be destroyed after March, Hitler's group said, although Reuters has been unable to confirm the destruction of any facilities by the Niger Delta Marine Force. The New Delta Avengers warned the Delta state government that  Operation Cripple Oil and Gas Production  would start on 30 June unless it held talks to ensure funding for infrastructure and other development reaches the region.  This campaign shall be BLOODY, DESTRUCTIVE AND VENGEFUL against the enemies of our people,  the group said.  Like a goat pushed to the wall we have grown teeth and we will prove our ability to bite.  Oil companies' rule of thumb is not to comment on militant threats to facilities in Nigeria. The security forces say they have no idea who is behind the latest threats, but with Nigeria about to bring back its oil exports to full capacity for the first time in 16 months following pipeline repairs, they will not take any chances.  We are not aware of such a group but are on the ground to do our job,  said Abubakar Abdullahi, spokesman for the joint military task force (JTF) which polices the Niger Delta.

The guidelines came after complaints by investors earlier this year that some funds with  Hong Kong  in their product names actually had little exposure to the stocks there. In a document obtained by Reuters on Wednesday, the guidelines also require fund managers with substantial Hong Kong experience to manage the Hong Kong-labeled products.  The guidelines, which the China Securities Regulatory Commission issued to domestic fund houses, could accelerate mainland money flows into Hong Kong as fund houses rush to launch funds that invest in one of the world's best-performing markets so far this year. Li Kai, vice head of product development at First Seafront Fund Management Co, which received the guidelines, said that although the rules apply to new funds, regulators may also ask existing funds to renew their registration and meet new asset allocation requirements. Currently, over 100 mutual funds in China have  Hong Kong  in their names. China's institutional and retail investors can now invest in Hong Kong stocks via the cross-border Stock Connect schemes. The new schemes have channeled steady inflows of mainland money, which helped push Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng Index to the highest level in nearly two years. The guidelines also require that Hong Kong-focused funds have at least two employees, one of whom has to be a fund manger, who have at least two years of investment management experience in Hong Kong. Under the new rules, Chinese mutual funds without  Hong Kong  in their names must not invest over 50 percent of their equity assets in Hong Kong stocks, the documents showed.

But for work, he plans to stay in Poland, perhaps opening his own business in a few years. The issue for Poland after the EU's waiver is how many of Potashnyi's compatriots -- possibly as many as a million of whom work in the country -- will do the same, and how many will move on to Germany and the like. It is a crucial question for the Polish central bank, in particular, as it watches for signs of wage pressures gradually accelerating throughout the economy. Potashnyi, a 27-year-old who left Ukraine a year ago to exchange a $400 monthly wage as a taxi driver for the $1,300-$1,400 he earns with Uber, reckons some will go, mostly those who would otherwise have returned to Ukraine.  I want to stay, but those who want to return to Ukraine (now) won't,  he said. The visa waiver means some Ukrainians, especially temporary construction workers, may take advantage of visa-free travel to seek higher-paying work further west in the EU, albeit often illegally. That could be a significant part of Poland's work force. Since Russia annexed the Crimean peninsula in 2014, plunging Ukraine into recession and instability, hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians have sought employment permits in Poland annually. Economists say this influx has helped keep wage pressures in Poland - a country of 38 million and 16 million workers - in check and also facilitated further economic growth. Poland has one of the fastest aging societies in the EU. The influx of Ukrainians runs contrary to most of the rest of Central Europe where years of westward EU emigration have left steep labour shortages. Polish central bankers have noted the risk.  It is very difficult to estimate, but definitely some Ukrainians working in Poland right now will move, for instance, to Germany,  Monetary Policy Council member Lukasz Hardt said.  This is a very important factor.  In recent months, central bankers have listed wage pressures as one of the most significant factors in their assessment of interest rates as the Polish economy recovers from a dip in growth last year. Role of Labour For now, the central bank is signalling borrowing costs will remain at record lows, possibly through 2018, with wage growth at around 4 percent annually. Unemployment rates are at their lowest since Poland's transition from communism in the early 1990s, but the Ukrainians are filling the job shortages and keeping wage growth from spiking. That compares with double-digit wage increases in Hungary, which has accepted significantly fewer Ukrainian workers and has mounting shortages of labour in construction, healthcare, retail and elsewhere. Polish Central Bank Governor Adam Glapinski said in May that rate-setters were watching out for potential outflows of Ukrainian workers but aren't worried for now. Sources within the bank say, however, that a minority of policymakers believe wage growth could force a hike sooner, driven in part by government plans to raise minimum pay and its move to lower the pension age later this year. Employers organisations say Poland's conservative government needs to do more to help migrant workers settle in Poland to plug labour shortages.  The legal labour market in Poland will have to compete with the EU's grey economy,  said Andrzej Kubisiak, a spokesman for Work Service, Poland's biggest employment agency. One employers group, Pracodawcy RP, said on Monday it expected the number of Ukrainian workers to rise in Poland in the short term now that visa requirements are lifted, potentially reaching 2 million. But, over time, the group said, some will travel elsewhere in the EU, seeking higher pay.  It's a pity the government isn't doing anything to stop them,  it said. In the end, Poland may end up hoping for more newcomers like Potashnyi.  You can earn well in Poland. In three to four years, you can have a normal life,  he said, content to stay.

The bar, which serves cocktails with a view over the capital while DJs spin electronic sets, was created in part to cater to a tourist boom in the wake of the U.S.-Cuban detente. Now, some two thirds of its clientele are Americans.  My friends and I have invested a lot in the possibility of the American public coming, so yes I'm worried,  said Coba, 27, echoing the view of many Cubans working in the relatively lucrative tourism sector.  This bar is quite progressive. It has a modern style and we generally have a lot of Americans.   Trump is expected to announce a new Cuba policy on Friday likely to tighten some rules on travel and trade, rolling back parts of former President Barack Obama's opening toward the island, U.S. officials and people familiar with the matter have told Reuters. Cuban state news outlets have barely covered such reports but they have trickled through via illegal satellite television and conversations with relatives abroad. Earlier on Tuesday, state-run Radio Reloj declared:  Here, we are all serene.   From Eisenhower to Trump, there has never been a North American government looking at Havana with friendship,  the broadcaster said.  For this reason, neither announcements nor new measures will rob us our sleep.  Many Cubans who have not felt much impact from the detente on their daily lives agree, and feel resigned. After all, the damaging U.S. trade embargo remains in place and they are struggling to get by as the economy wrestles with falling exports and a decline in oil shipments from key ally Venezuela. But for those in the tourism industry, that has benefited tangibly from a threefold increase in U.S. visitors in the past two years, it is a different story. Americans now make up some 7 percent of total visits - 15 percent including Cuban Americans - and a much larger proportion in Havana given many of Cuba's tourists are Canadians on package trips who head directly to the beach resorts. A woman has a drink in a bar in Havana, Cuba June 12, 2017.Stringer Some 85 percent of our clients are Americans and they are the ones who consume most and pay the best,  said Yuri Barroso, doing promotion for a restaurant on Plaza Vieja, a square surrounded by elegantly restored colonial buildings. Barroso said that if the number of U.S. tourists were to fall again, it would cause  pain for many Cubans  who like him worked in the tourism sector and support their family. The United States still officially prohibits its citizens from visiting Cuba as tourists. However, travel between the two countries is easier now than it has been in more than half a century thanks to a  general license , which allows travelers to claim they are visiting family or engaging in business, cultural, religious or educational activities. Slideshow (10 Images)Many Cubans, like Coba, had been banking on the number of American arrivals continuing to grow. A recent report by the Boston Consulting Group said U.S. visitors to Cuba could rise by as much as sevenfold by 2025. But that now looks unlikely. One proposal under consideration by the Trump administration, according to the U.S. sources, would tighten enforcement to make sure Americans legally fit the categories they claim to be traveling under, which could spook many visitors, wary of receiving a hefty fine. Critics of Obamaâs approach contend that many U.S. visitors have taken advantage of eased regulations and looser scrutiny to visit the island for pleasure trips. Another harsher measure â but one considered less likely to be implemented - would be reverting to regulations requiring U.S. travelers to seek a special license to travel to Cuba. Most Americans would therefore likely choose to visit Cuba only as part of a group that organizes the paperwork. Analysts say this would make travel there more expensive and less spontaneous. American visits would likely drop, hurting both U.S. airlines and accommodation services operating there, as well as the Cuban tourism industry. Yaquelin Betancourt, 43, who has been renting out rooms on Airbnb since it entered the Cuban market in 2015, said any decrease would be a severe blow.  I depend on rent to survive,  she said.  If I had Trump in front of me now, I'd say: leave us in peace. This is a people who does not want conflict with the United States.

The draft law, first reported on by the Russian daily Vedomosti on Wednesday, was published on Tuesday and has been reviewed by Reuters.  If approved by parliament and the president, it would allow the defense minister and other high-ranking officials to ban certain groups of servicemen from posting online information that could help identify or geolocate them. Soldiers would also be obliged to routinely share information about their social media accounts with the authorities. Despite strict legislation on state secrets, Russian soldiers regularly post sensitive data online. British researcher Eliot Higgins, founder of the Bellingcat project, which uses open source data to investigate conflicts, says his team identified Russian soldiers involved in the fatal downing of the MH17 passenger plane over eastern Ukraine in 2014 by collecting evidence from social networks.  You may not believe it but (Russia's) 53rd Air Defense Brigade has a social media page and all the soldiers follow it,  Higgins said at one of his presentations on the incident. He said the information had been shared with the International Joint Investigation Team, the main body investigating the crash. Russia denies any involvement in downing the plane.

The previous interim government in Sofia had said talks should start with Sweden for the purchase of eight Gripen aircraft, but current Prime Minister Boyko Borissov has cast doubts on whether Sofia should rush into a deal, estimated at 1.5 billion levs ($860 million). The defense ministry, looking to replace ageing MiG-29 aircraft, had picked the Swedish jet over an offer from Portugal and the United States for second-hand U.S. F-16s and an Italian offer of second-hand Eurofighter Typhoons.  What we hope and expect is that we would be called to negotiate ... probably after the summer break,  Magnus Lewis-Olsson, Saab's head of Europe, told reporters in Sofia.   If Bulgaria wants their aircraft in quite quickly then obviously we hope negotiations (are going) to start soon because we've got to build the aircraft as well,  he said. Bulgarian officials say the country, a member of the European Union and NATO, should move ahead simultaneously with buying new ships and armored vehicles for its army, and that would require significant financial resources. Lewis-Olsson said Saab was ready to discuss different financing options, including payments over a long period, and would be prepared to provide about 4 fighter jets in 18 months upon signing.  This is something that is going to last for 40 years, it is a cost for a country for a long time, so we are prepared to discuss how we finance it,  he said. Last month Saab, which has provided Gripen warplanes to Hungary and the Czech Republic, said it hoped Croatia could enter the market for fighter jets soon and that it would hold talks with Slovakia over new aircraft.

EasyJet announced last month that it had arranged to convert part of an Airbus order to larger planes to cut costs per seat, and was also postponing some orders of smaller planes as it reported a bigger-than-expected half year loss. The low-cost airline took delivery of its first A320neo jet on Wednesday, its 300th plane, with new, more fuel efficient engines.  A 15 pct reduction in fuel burn is relevant at any fuel price,  CEO Carolyn McCall said in Toulouse as the A320neo was delivered. She was referring to the fact fuel prices have fallen since the planes were ordered.  We are able to take more A321neos in our framework but we haven't as yet committed to taking any more... It will be on our radar as we go through the next 12-18 months , she said. EasyJet has already switched 30 of its 130 A320neo orders for larger A321neo's, which seat an additional 49 passengers and are set to bring the cost per seat down by 8-9 percent compared with the smaller plane. The engines of the A320neo are made by CFM International, a joint venture between General Electric Co (GE.N) and Safran SA (SAF.PA) of France.  A rival engine made by Pratt & Whitney has suffered hardware and software problems, leading to delivery delays.  My goodness, we're glad we choose CFM,  McCall quipped.     Outlook Improves, Brexit Plans in Place McCall said easyJet had had a good third quarter and that the environment was improving, with rivals not growing as fast as previously.   Over time, that will drive yields,  she told Reuters, referring to a measure of revenue per passenger. Rivals are also switching to bigger planes. Wizz Air (WIZZ.L) is shifting from the 180-seat A320 to A321s which can carry up to 239 passengers. Ryanair (RYA.I) is set to order Boeing's proposed new 737 MAX 10 airliner, which seats up to 230 passengers and is designed to challenge the A321.  EasyJet is likely to use the larger planes to fly out of airports such as London Gatwick, Paris Orly and Amsterdam where it is hard to get new slots. McCall told journalists she had not seen any impact on bookings from recent attacks in London and Manchester and the uncertainty created by last week's UK general election did not alter its own plans. The carrier has applied for an operating licence in an EU member state to allow it to keep flying intra-EU routes once Britain leaves the bloc and it hopes the application will be approved this summer. McCall said meeting EU ownership and control regulations would be no problem after Brexit because it is already 48 percent owned by someone from one of the remaining EU countries, founder Stelios Haji-Ioannou. Elsewhere, easyJet has expressed an interest to administrators looking to sell Alitalia, but McCall said that interested parties had been asked not to comment further.

The Teranet-National Bank Composite House Price Index, which measures changes for repeat sales of single-family homes, showed prices rose 2.2 percent last month. Prices were higher in all 11 cities included in the index, led by a 3.6 percent increase in Toronto and a 3.1 percent rise in nearby Hamilton. While other recent data suggested activity in the Toronto market cooled in May, Wednesday's report pointed to accelerating price growth in the resale market. Compared with a year ago, prices were up 28.7 percent in Toronto and 23.5 percent in Hamilton, a record for both. For Toronto, Canada's largest city, it was the fourteenth consecutive month of acceleration in home prices on an annual basis, the report said. Amid worries of overheating, the Ontario government announced measures at the end of April to try to rein in price gains in Toronto and the surrounding areas, including a foreign buyers tax. Prices rose 1.5 percent on the month in Vancouver, bringing the city's price index to a new peak. Still, the annual pace of gains slowed to 8.2 percent. The British Columbia provincial government imposed its own foreign buyers tax in Vancouver last summer, which helped cool the West Coast market, but there are signs the market is rebounding. The Bank of Canada warned last week that rising consumer debt levels and an unbalanced housing market have raised household vulnerabilities.

Densely populated Bangladesh is battered by storms, floods and landslides every rainy season. The latest casualties come weeks after Cyclone Mora killed at least seven people and damaged tens of thousands of homes. Landslides hit three hilly districts in Bangladesh's southeast early on Tuesday, killing 100 people in Rangamati, 36 in Chittagong and six in Bandarban, saidÂ Reaz Ahmed, head of theÂ department of disasterÂ management. Fresh landslides on Wednesday killed one person in the district of Khagrachari and two in the coastal town of Cox's Bazar, he added. The town bordering Myanmar is home to thousands of Rohingya Muslim refugees and was just beginning to recover from Cyclone Mora.  Ahmed said many people were still missing in the landslide-hit districts and the death toll could rise further as rescuers search for bodies. The toll included four soldiers  trapped by a landslide during a rescue operation in Rangamati, he added. People walk in floodwaters following landslides triggered by heavy rain in Khagrachari, Bangladesh, in this still frame taken from video June 13, 2017.REUTERS TVShah Kamal, the secretary of Bangladesh's disaster ministry, said there had been no rain on Wednesday and rescue operations were in full swing.  It is a great relief. Some areas in the district are still cut off but people are being moved through navy boats,  he told Reuters by telephone from Rangamati. But weather officials in Bangladesh have forecast light to moderate showers accompanied by gusty or squally wind during the next 24 hours in places like Chittagong. In the Indian states of Mizoram and Assam, which border Bangladesh, at least 11 people were killed as incessant rains flooded major cities. Authorities in Mizoram retrieved nine bodies, but about seven people were still missing after landslides caused several homes to cave in, the state's urban development minister said. India was ready to support Bangladesh with search and rescue efforts if needed, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's office said in a statement.

Against the euro and yen, the greenback was solidly higher but it saw losses for a second day against the commodity bloc of currencies, all of which have benefited from a surge in expectations of higher Canadian interest rates. Worries about the pace of global growth and weakness in markets for the commodities they produce drove a 5 percent slide in the values of both Australia's and Canada's dollars between March and May. But after comments by Bank of Canada Deputy Governor Carolyn Wilkins on Monday flipped markets towards an earlier rise in borrowing rates there, traders and analysts say  short  bets against the commodity bloc currencies have looked exposed. The Canadian currency is in the middle of its best week since April of last year, up 2.5 percent since last Friday.  There was a stale short of the commodity bloc and the move in the CAD has dragged them higher,  said Stephen Gallo, head of European FX strategy with Bank of Montreal in London. By 0743 GMT in London, the Canadian, New Zealand and Aussie dollars were between 0.2 and 0.6 percent higher on the day against their U.S. counterpart at respectively C$1.3218, $0.7248 and $0.7581. With sterling again in retreat on signs of a delay in signing a deal to allow the formation of a Conservative government, the dollar index that measures the greenback's broader strength gained 0.1 percent.  Dovish Hike  The Fed is scheduled to announce its monetary policy decision at 1800 GMT on Wednesday at the end of a two-day policy meeting, followed by a press conference by U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen. A rise in rates is baked in and may give the dollar only the most minimal of boosts. Any signal that the U.S. central bank is moving towards a reduction in its holdings of more than $4 trillion in Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities might have some more impact. But there are also expectations of tweak in the Fed's outlook to reflect a weaker run of data since the start of the year.  People are positioned for a dovish hike,  BMO's Gallo said.  We'll still see rate hikes baked in for the future. But there is a risk that they will send some sort of dovish signal. A median dot comes down, something like that. If Yellen says something about balance sheet reduction, that would be dollar positive.  Fed funds futures on Tuesday suggested traders saw only a 29 percent chance of rates rising to 1.25-1.50 percent at the Fed's Sept. 19-20 meeting, and a 57 percent chance of such a move at its Dec. 12-13 meeting .  What investors want to know most is the pace of rate hikes going forward,  said Ayako Sera, senior market economist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust in Tokyo.  With many market participants worried about a dovish outlook, a surprisingly hawkish one could catch some investors off guard,  she said.  The U.S. economy isn't doing so badly, so anything is possible.

The fund holds the state's stakes in Bahraini companies including Aluminium Bahrain (Alba) and telecoms company Batelco, with a portfolio valued at more than $10 billion.  We are very confident in investing in the U.S. market,  Alkooheji said in a telephone interview with Reuters on Wednesday.  We are looking at some business opportunities to invest in the Saudi market. The sectors we are interested in are education, healthcare and services,  he added. The state investor reported on Wednesday a 140 percent rise in annual net profit, which AlKooheji said was due to a big drop in impairments. Mumtalakat's profit for last year was 68.9 million dinars ($183 million), up from 28.7 million dinars in the previous year when profits were depressed by an adjustment on goodwill against Alba as a result of lower aluminium prices. Mumtalakat's more recent investments constituted less than 10 percent of its portfolio value, yet they contributed more than 15 percent to total annual dividends received, the company said. Last year it acquired a significant equity stake in KOS Group, a European healthcare group focused on long-term care, and a significant stake in a specialised international provider of water treatment solutions, Envirogen Group. Asked if the rift between Qatar and some Arab states, including Bahrain, was affecting the investment climate in the region, Alkooheji said he had not seen any change and added the state investor does not have any direct investments in Qatar. The Bahrain sovereign fund is smaller in size than large state funds such as Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, which manages $828 billion, and Qatar Investment Authority which holds $342 billion in assets, according to the Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute. Mumtalakat's investment style is more similar to UAE's state investor Mubadala Investment Co and Singapore's Temasek Holdings. Mumtalakat holds stakes in more than 50 enterprises across manufacturing, financial services, tourism, telecommunications, real estate, logistics, consumer and healthcare. Around 78 percent of its assets are in Bahrain, 20 percent in countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council and the rest in other parts of the world such as the United States, Alkooheji said. The fund hopes to take part in the initial public offering (IPO) of shares in Saudi state oil giant Aramco, the fund's CEO told Reuters earlier this month.

The proposals come as the UK prepares to negotiate its departure from the EU, placing the future of LCH's SwapClear platform at the heart of the debate. The London-based clearing platform is responsible for more than 75% of euro swaps clearing. The platform deals with more than â¬1.3trn of daily notional across its over-the-counter euro interest rate derivatives products. Central counterparty clearing firms have become critical pieces of infrastructure since the European Markets Infrastructure Regulation forced standardised swaps into clearing. With a significant volume of euro swaps cleared by third-country CCPs, the European Commission is concerned about the impact those entities could have on EU financial stability and believes that those risks are exacerbated with the UK set to leave the bloc in March 2019.  The continued safety and stability of our financial system remains a key priority,  said Valdis Dombrovskis, European Commission vice-president responsible for financial stability, financial services and capital markets union in a statement.  As we face the departure of the largest EU financial centre, we need to make certain adjustments to our rules to ensure that our efforts remain on track.  Under the proposed framework, the European Securities and Markets Authority would be granted new supervisory powers over CCPs in the EU and third countries. A new CCP Executive Session would be created within ESMA, consisting of newly appointed independent members and representatives of the national authorities and central banks responsible for supervising individual CCPs. Two-Tier System The proposals introduce a two-tier system for third-country CCPs, based on size and notional cleared in each EU currency as well as the CCP's links to the EU and potential impact on financial stability if the CCP were to fail.  Tier 1  CCPs, which are not deemed systemically important, would continue to operate under the existing EMIR equivalence framework, which already recognises 28 CCPs outside of the bloc. Systemically important entities, or  Tier 2  CCPs, would be subject to stricter rules including compliance with prudential regulations and EU central bank requirements on CCP collateral and liquidity arrangements. Entities deemed to be of such systemic importance to EU member states that the framework would be insufficient to mitigate potential risks, would be required to be authorised within the EU in order to continue providing services across the bloc. According to the Commission document, the classification of  substantially systemically important CCPs  will be made by ESMA in agreement with relevant central banks.  In this case, the CCP would have to establish itself in the EU and apply for authorisation to the competent authority of the member state where it wishes to establish itself in accordance with the requirements laid out under EMIR,  the Commission said in a Q&A; document. Lseg Warns on Relocation London Stock Exchange Group, LCH's parent, warned against forced relocation but welcomed enhanced regulatory and supervisory cooperation, noting that a similar arrangement between the UK and US supported financial stability across the market, providing economic efficiencies for customers and the real economy. âA location policy does the opposite, it increases, not decreases, risk and costs for customers,  LSEG said in a statement.  Given these facts, European and global customers have overwhelmingly expressed a clear preference for shared regulation between the EU, the UK and the US.  LSEG also noted that the firm's clearing operations do not rely on equivalence as they are fully licensed and regulated in a number of jurisdictions across the US, EU, UK and Asia. That includes a Paris-based clearinghouse that is home to LCH's CDSClear platform.  Regardless of the outcome of these proposals, London Stock Exchange Group is well positioned to continue to provide a seamless service to all its customers given our global presence and unique open access business model,  the statement said. Market participants have criticised efforts to relocate swaps clearing, given the expected fragmentation that could pose a threat to market liquidity and increase costs for users. According to LSEG estimates, the loss of margin efficiencies stemming from fragmentation of clearing services could cost US$77bn in additional margin - potentially strangling derivatives users that are already facing higher costs associated with the sweeping overhaul of derivatives markets under EMIR. Some dispute that estimate, however. At an industry conference earlier this month, Eurex clearing head, Eric Mueller said that the real cost could be just a fraction of that level.  It is very far from a realistic number,  said Mueller, speaking last week at the FIA's IDX conference in London. He warned market participants to focus on solutions, rather than dismissing concerns presented by European policymakers and the ECB.  We have to be flexible as there will be an industry-led solution to the concerns,  he said. With estimates suggesting that euro-clearing relocation could force as many as 83,000 jobs out of London, participants are seeking more detail around the scope of proposed rules.  We would need to work out what ârelocationâ really means,  said Steve Grob, director of group strategy at Fidessa, a trading technology firm. He said that in addition to people, infrastructure and technology issues, other practical concerns range from the language in which contracts will be printed, to the legal regimes and bankruptcy laws under which they will be enforceable.  History has also chosen that carrots are better than sticks in changing people's behaviour,  said Grob.  If you really want an industry to move wholesale to a different country then you have to give those people some pretty compelling incentives. None of those seem to be in evidence at the moment.

The German carrier, 29 percent-owned by Abu Dhabi-based carrier Etihad, last week asked Berlin and North-Rhine Westphalia (NRW) to consider loan guarantees, a move which shows how precarious its situation is, according to Germany's federal economy minister. German newspaper Welt reported on Tuesday that Air Berlin is seeking loan guarantees of around 100 million euros ($112.00 million).  It's a confidential figure,  Air Berlin CEO Thomas Winkelmann told Reuters after the carrier's annual general meeting in London when asked for details of its request.  And we're not looking for any kind of taxpayers' money. We don't want to be state-owned. As management, we look at every opportunity over how to restructure the company, and that includes restructuring the debt.  He has previously said that Air Berlin is seeking a partner, and larger rival Lufthansa, which last year agreed a long-term deal to lease 38 planes and crew from Air Berlin, is seen as the obvious investor.  Air Berlin still has very interesting assets in Germany,  he said.  That strong market position is, I think, interesting for a couple of players in the European market.

Founded in 1744 as a forum for chartering vessels, the Baltic Exchange now produces benchmark indexes for global shipping rates and owns a trading platform for the multi-billion dollar freight derivatives market. SGX's ownership of the Baltic has enabled the exchange to set its sights on developing new areas, especially in Asia - a region which is set to drive seaborne trade going forward, the Baltic's CEO Mark Jackson told Reuters.  They (SGX) are looking at a long-term goal - this is about improving the maritime footprint in Asia and the Baltic is a vehicle for them to do that,  Jackson said in an interview.  They are looking at me to give them a return on their investment.  SGX completed its 87 million pound ($111 million) acquisition of the Baltic in November last year. Jackson, who took the helm earlier this year, said the Baltic was looking into creating a new benchmark route from South America or the United States to China specifically for grains. Profitability for the world's biggest agri-business players including U.S. group Archer Daniels Midland Co and rivals such as Bunge Ltd has been battered by thinning margins due to a global grain glut. Jackson said the potential for such a freight benchmark for grains would be in providing more volatility, adding it was  a trading opportunity . Many shipping markets are struggling with a near-decade long downturn with companies trying to find ways to boost bottom lines. Jackson said the Baltic was also looking into creating LNG freight rates for specific routes, which would mark another new direction for the exchange. He said such a freight benchmark would support SGX's existing spot LNG pricing, which would help to develop Singapore's wider plans to become a bunkering hub for LNG as a marine fuel. The Baltic offers a variety of freight indexes focused on the shipping of dry bulk commodities such as iron ore, coal and grains as well as for oil tankers and for liquid petroleum gas (LPG).  Expanding our container footprint is something we need to do,  Jackson said, adding he did not rule out a move into other areas such as air freight going forward.

He told a dinner of Brazilian state governors in Brasilia late on Tuesday that he wished to find a solution as soon as possible to the mounting debt burden of regional governments, according to the person, who requested anonymity to speak freely about the matter. The person said the refinancing of 20 billion reais of that amount is  just a step away  and could be finalized by September because of legislation that facilitates the renegotiation of state liabilities with the bank. The remaining amount may depend on an executive decree, said the person. Temer's office did not immediately comment. Several states have struggled to pay salaries for police and doctors and to keep hospitals stocked with medical supplies. Their finances have been squeezed by a steep decline in commodity prices, a prolonged recession and years of budget mismanagement. Since taking office a year ago, Temer has offered states some debt relief without undermining his vow to narrow a record high budget deficit.

Latin America Power (LAP) has more than 300 megawatts of wind and hydropower assets in Chile and Peru, over 250 megawatts of which is located in Chile. That includes two large wind farms  near the Chilean capital Santiago. In 2015, now-bankrupt SunEdison (SUNEQ.PK) agreed to purchase the company, which is partially held by Grupo BTG Pactual SA [BTG.UL] and Blackstone Group-backed Patria Investimentos (BX.N), for $700 million. The U.S. solar company later terminated the deal, however, resulting in a court battle and a $28.5 million settlement for LAP in 2016. LAP then put its assets back on the market and attracted interest from a number of companies including Chilean power company Colbun (COL.SN), SPIC, and Canadian company BluEarth Renewables Inc, according to the sources who requested anonymity as they are not permitted to speak publicly.  However, both BluEarth and Colbun (COL.SN) are no longer in the running, the sources said. SPIC, through a Chilean subsidiary, declined to comment, as did LAP and Colbun. BluEarth said in a statement that it  is always exploring new opportunities, including the Chilean power market,  but would not comment on  rumors or speculation  as a matter of policy. The potential acquisition by SPIC marks another big move by the company into Latin American renewables. In late 2015, the state-owned utility snapped up IFM Investors' Pacific Hydro for $2.5 billion. That company had almost 1 gigawatt of wind and hydropower assets in operation at the time of acquisition, spread throughout Brazil, Chile, and Australia. In recent years, China has been upping its investments in Chile. In addition to energy acquisitions, Chinese companies have made bids for major infrastructure projects and are in discussions to link the two countries with a $600 million underwater fiber optic cable.

It voted 534 to 88 in favor of binding national targets for slashing greenhouse gas emissions in sectors including transport, agriculture and waste management to achieve the bloc's overall goal of emissions at least 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030. Taking the floor ahead of the vote, EU politicians reiterated disappointment over Trump's decision and rejected his call to renegotiate what he called the  draconian  economic costs of a deal they pledged to implement without Washington.  The refusal of the US to commit to the Paris agreement will push the rest of the world to be even more united against climate change,  European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker told the parliament.  In months of tough talks, deputies sought a compromise between ambitious climate measures and concerns among the bloc's 28-member states over the economic strain of the requisite shift to low-carbon technology in big employment sectors. Environment campaigners hailed the draft law's call for a more ambitious baseline for calculating emission-reduction targets than that proposed by the European Commission, the EU executive. However, the parliament voted against a proposal to decrease the amount of credits from well-managed forests, which absorb carbon dioxide, that may be used to offset emissions. It also included measures to support lower-income EU member states.  Today's vote gives a crystal clear signal to Donald Trump: Europe acts on its commitments under the Paris agreement and seizes the opportunities of green growth, with or without you,  said Gerben-Jan Gerbrandy, a Dutch deputy who shepherded the draft law through the chamber. The legislation still needs the support of EU governments before becoming law in a lengthy process of up to two year. The EU, the world's third-largest emitter, has pledged to team up with China, world's largest polluter, to defend the Paris climate pact's goal of limit global warming to  well below  2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels. But the bloc still faces hurdles implementing its climate goals that include truculent member states like pro-coal Poland and Britain's plans to exit from the bloc.

The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) * Graphic of OPEC exports in 2017 vs 2016: tmsnrt.rs/2sZPdJT By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, June 14 (Reuters) - OPEC has finally acknowledged what the oil market already knows, namely that rebalancing is taking longer than expected. Perhaps this is because OPEC is actually shipping more crude. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries prefers to talk about output when assessing the impact of the deal among members and 11 allied countries to reduce production by 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd). While output is no doubt important, for the immediate market impact it's probably better to focus on what the group is actually exporting. Vessel-tracking and port data in Thomson Reuters Eikon shows that for the first five months of 2017, OPEC exported 25.6 million bpd. This figure is only shipments by tanker and is filtered to show vessels that have already discharged, are discharging or are en route to their destination. The shipments for the first five months of this year are slightly higher than the 25.4 million bpd the producer group exported via tankers in the same period in 2016. In May, OPEC shipments were 25.6 million bpd, up from April's 25.02 million bpd, according to the vessel-tracking data. The increase in exports via tanker was also reflected in higher output by the group, which said in a report on Tuesday that it produced 32.14 million bpd in May, up 336,000 bpd from the prior month. The increase was largely because members that are exempt from the output cuts agreed in November, such as Libya and Nigeria, increased production after prior curtailments due to civil unrest. Nonetheless, the increase in output and exports via tanker show the scale of the challenge facing OPEC, and its de facto leader Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest crude exporter. The Saudis are carrying the bulk of the output reductions among OPEC members, and the shipping data suggest they are doing their part by lowering exports as well. In the first five months of 2017 Saudi Arabia exported 7.48 million bpd via tankers, down 440,000 bpd from 7.92 million bpd in the same period in 2016. This reduction in exports is close to the 500,000 bpd output cut pledged by the Saudis in terms of the November agreement, which was extended last month to March 2018. Saudis Stand Alone? The problem for the Saudis is that it appears fellow OPEC members aren't doing as much to help the cause of rebalancing oil markets and therefore boosting prices. It's the sort of situation that's unlikely to persist, with the Saudis likely to demand more compliance from OPEC and the 11 allied producers, including Russia. If the Saudis don't see meaningful reductions in output and exports by its allies, it's likely that they will be forced to scale back the extent of their output and export reductions. The dilemma facing the Saudis is encapsulated by China, the world's largest crude oil importer and the Saudis biggest customer. China imported 12.5 percent more oil in the first four months of this year, but imports from Saudi Arabia rose by a paltry 2.5 percent. In contrast, China's imports from fellow OPEC member Angola jumped 13.3 percent and those from allied producer Russia gained 8.1 percent. This shows that the Saudis are not only surrendering market share in China, they are partly giving it up to countries that are supposed to be joining the kingdom in output cuts. In addition, producers outside the agreement to cut output are gleefully snaring increased market share in China. Imports from Brazil jumped 41.2 percent in the first four months of the year compared to the same period in 2016, making the South American nation China's seventh-largest supplier. While rising from small bases, it's worth noting that China's imports from Britain are up 245 percent and those from the United States 3,886 percent. Taken together, these two non-traditional suppliers to China accounted for 3 percent of the country's imports in the first four months of the year. That may not sound like a lot, but it equates to about 260,000 bpd in British and U.S. exports to China. The Saudis may well look at that figure and think that they should have supplied that crude to China, but they haven't in the name of rebalancing the market. It's not like the Saudis are enjoying significantly higher prices, with Brent crude ending on Tuesday at $48.72 a barrel, perilously close to the $46.38 close the day before the Nov. 30 deal between OPEC and its allies. It seems the Saudis have given up much to get little in return. Editing by Richard Pullin","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/column-russell-opec-crude-idUSL3N1JB2AW"},

Crew launches debt restructuring deal","keywords":"United States,JCREW,DEBTRESTRUCTURING/,Americas,United States","sector":"","content":"June 14 - J. Crew Group Inc disclosed terms on Tuesday of a debt restructuring deal that would roughly cut in half the value of its nearly $567 million in bonds, as well as extend their maturity by two years, after receiving the backing of some key creditors. The move comes after Reuters reported last month that two investment firms, Blackstone Group LP's GSO Capital Partners LP and Anchorage Capital Group LLC, were snapping up J. Crew's debt to facilitate such a deal. The U.S. fashion retailer, facing a total debt load of $2.1 billion, asked creditors to agree to an out-of-court restructuring that would extend the maturity on bonds to 2021, which would give J. Crew more time to turn around its business and boost declining sales. J. Crew has also asked for the withdrawal of a lawsuit seeking to block its move of its intellectual property to an affiliated company. The retailer plans to pay the separate company for the use of its brand, which was opposed by some of the term loan holders, spurring the lawsuit. GSO and hedge fund Anchorage have already agreed to swap their bonds for the new ones and to end the lawsuit, according to Securities and Exchange Commission documents filed Tuesday and two people familiar with the deal. The backing of these two creditors is important, because together they hold 28 percent of J. Crew's $1.5 billion term loan and 67 percent of the company's approximately $500 million in bonds, according to the filings and people. J. Crew requires 95 percent of its bondholders to accept the deal, the company has said, and can also secure a waiver to any lawsuit from a group of creditors that have a majority position in its loan. GSO and Anchorage however face opposition from another group of creditors led by Eaton Vance Management who have invested in the term loan and plan to block J. Crew's proposed restructuring, one of the people said. That group is working on having lenders agree to a cooperation agreement to block the deal, that person said, without disclosing the size of the group's position in the debt. The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. J. Crew did not immediately respond to a request for comment beyond what it has said publicly. Both GSO and Anchorage declined to comment. Eaton Vance did not immediately return a request for comment.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/jcrew-debtrestructuring-idUSL1N1JB0DZ"},

On Wall Street, the S&P; 500 was poised to open at a record high with futures  up 0.1 percent. Futures on the tech-heavy Nasdaq rose 0.2 percent as the sector continues its recovery from last week's selloff. For now, all eyes are on the Fed. The widely expected quarter-point interest rate hike will take the Fed funds target rate above 1 percent for the first time since the immediate aftermath of the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008. Market participants' focus will be on signals on the frequency of further hikes and how the Fed plans to unwind its huge Treasury bond stockpile over the years ahead. The U.S. central bank is scheduled to release its decision at 1800 GMT on Wednesday with a news conference to follow from Chair Janet Yellen.  With financial conditions remaining supportive ... and US financials breaking higher, the Fed may see little reason to moderate its rate hike projections when meeting today,  strategists at Morgan Stanley said in a note to clients. The U.S. bank expects the dollar to gain 2 percent against major currencies over the next few weeks. On Wednesday, the dollar index barely budged as slightly firmer moves against the euro and yen were offset by losses against the commodity bloc of currencies, such as the Australian and Canadian dollars. Worries about the pace of global growth and weakness in markets for the commodities they produce drove a 5-percent slide in the values of both Australia's and Canada's dollars between March and May. Relatively upbeat economic data from China and a surge in expectations of higher Canadian interest rates have helped currencies of commodities-related economies. In the UK, disappointing wage growth data and a report that a deal needed to form a new government could be delayed until next week hurt sterling, which gave up early gains. The pound had been recovering from its almost 3 percent slide since Prime Minister Theresa May unexpectedly lost her parliamentary majority in a national election last Thursday.  One of the things we thought was very positive for sterling was that we'd extended the life of the parliament to give a very large window after the end of the two-year negotiation period (on Brexit),  said Adam Cole, head of G10 currency strategy with RBC in London.  That no longer looks like the case.  Optimism about the euro zone economy continued to underpin European equities, however, where the pan-European STOXX 600 was up 0.6 percent, led by industrials and financials. However, worries about equity valuations, particularly in the tech sector which nosedived last week, are creeping up among investors. A record number of investors believes equities are overvalued and three-quarters say internet stocks are expensive or in a bubble, a Bank of America Merrill Lynch fund manager poll showed on Tuesday Strategists at Deutsche Bank warned that its European  complacency indicator , which measures valuations relative to market volatility, was at an 11-year high, and the bank expects economic momentum to fade in coming months. Europe's benchmark bond yield held near seven-week lows ahead of the Fed decision. In commodities, oil prices fell about 1 percent, on the backfoot again on worries about US oversupply. Brent crude oil was down 44 cents a barrel at $48.28 while U.S. crude was 55 cents lower at $45.92.

I'm deeply saddened by the unfortunate allegations that they have made,  he said.  While siblings may have differences, I believe that any such differences should stay in the family,  added Lee, who is overseas on holiday with his family. At the heart of the family dispute is whether a house in which their father, Lee Kuan Yew, lived most of his life should be demolished. He was the first prime minister of Singapore and ruled the country for three decades. Before he died in 2015, the founding father of modern Singapore made it public that he wanted the house, a humbly furnished home with retro furniture near the bustling Orchard shopping district, demolished.

It voted 534 to 88 in favor of binding national targets for slashing greenhouse gas emissions in sectors including transport, agriculture and waste management to achieve the bloc's overall goal of emissions at least 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030. Taking the floor ahead of the vote, EU politicians reiterated disappointment over Trump's decision and rejected his call to renegotiate what he called the  draconian  economic costs of a deal they pledged to implement without Washington.  The refusal of the US to commit to the Paris agreement will push the rest of the world to be even more united against climate change,  European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker told the parliament.  In months of tough talks, deputies sought a compromise between ambitious climate measures and concerns among the bloc's 28-member states over the economic strain of the requisite shift to low-carbon technology in big employment sectors. Environment campaigners hailed the draft law's call for a more ambitious baseline for calculating emission-reduction targets than that proposed by the European Commission, the EU executive. However, the parliament voted against a proposal to decrease the amount of credits from well-managed forests, which absorb carbon dioxide, that may be used to offset emissions. It also included measures to support lower-income EU member states.  Today's vote gives a crystal clear signal to Donald Trump: Europe acts on its commitments under the Paris agreement and seizes the opportunities of green growth, with or without you,  said Gerben-Jan Gerbrandy, a Dutch deputy who shepherded the draft law through the chamber. The legislation still needs the support of EU governments before becoming law in a lengthy process of up to two year. The EU, the world's third-largest emitter, has pledged to team up with China, world's largest polluter, to defend the Paris climate pact's goal of limit global warming to  well below  2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels. But the bloc still faces hurdles implementing its climate goals that include truculent member states like pro-coal Poland and Britain's plans to exit from the bloc.

The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said no immediate decision had been made about the troop levels, which are now set at about 8,400.  The Pentagon declined to comment.  The decision is similar to one announced in April that applied to U.S. troop levels in Iraq and Syria, and came as Mattis warned Congress the U.S.-backed Afghan forces were not beating the Taliban despite more than 15 years of war.   We are not winning in Afghanistan right now,  Mattis said in testimony to the Senate Armed Services Committee earlier on Tuesday.  And we will correct this as soon as possible. COMMENTARY: Why a troop surge in Afghanistan is a terrible idea Mattis said the Taliban were  surging  at the moment, something he said he intended to address.  A former U.S. official said such a decision might allow the White House to argue that it was not micromanaging as much as the administration of former President Barack Obama was sometimes accused of doing.  Critics say delegating too much authority to the military does not shield Trump from political responsibility during battlefield setbacks and could reduce the chances for diplomats to warn of potential blowback from military decisions.  It has been four months since Army General John Nicholson, who leads U.S. and international forces in Afghanistan, said he needed  a few thousand  additional forces, some potentially drawn from U.S. allies.  U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis testifies before the Senate Armed Services Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., U.S., June 13, 2017.Aaron P. BernsteinCurrent and former U.S. officials say discussions revolve around adding 3,000 to 5,000 troops. Those forces are expected to be largely comprised of trainers to support Afghan forces, as well as air crews.  Deliberations include giving more authority to forces on the ground and taking more aggressive action against Taliban fighters.  Some U.S. officials have questioned the benefit of sending more troops to Afghanistan because any politically palatable number would not be enough to turn the tide, much less create stability and security. To date, more than 2,300 Americans have been killed and more than 17,000 wounded since the war began in 2001.  Any increase of several thousand troops would leave American forces in Afghanistan well below their 2011 peak of more than 100,000 troops.  The Afghan government was assessed by the U.S. military to control or influence just 59.7 percent of Afghanistan's 407 districts as of Feb. 20, a nearly 11 percentage-point decrease from the same time in 2016, according to data released by the U.S. Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction.  A truck bomb explosion in Kabul last month killed more than 150 people, making it the deadliest attack in the Afghan capital since the Taliban were ousted in 2001 by a NATO-led coalition after ruling the country for five years.  On Saturday, three U.S. soldiers were killed when an Afghan soldier opened fire on them in eastern Afghanistan.  The broader regional U.S. strategy for Afghanistan remains unclear. Mattis promised on Tuesday to brief lawmakers on a new war strategy by mid-July that is widely expected to call for thousands more U.S. troops.  Senator John McCain, the chairman of the Armed Forces Committee, pressed Mattis on the deteriorating situation during the Tuesday hearing, saying the United States had an urgent need for  a change in strategy, and an increase in resources if we are to turn the situation around.    We recognize the need for urgency,  Mattis said.  Reporting by Phil Stewart and Idrees Ali.

The sport's drive for medals meant behavioral issues were not addressed as British Cycling lost sight of basic duties of care to staff, said the Cycling Independent Review (CIR), which also criticized the former technical director, Shane Sutton, and UK Sport, the government's funding organization.  Many WCP staff members referred to a 'culture of fear' in terms of retribution or losing employment,  it said.  The panel found that there were failings in British Cycling's governance and leadership, monitoring and supervision of the WCP (World Class Programme), training and development, and management and communications with staff and athletes,  it added.  The CIR also  drew attention  to the Commissioning Board  unsubstantiated evidence  made by some contributors of alleged financial irregularities and historic doping. The CIR said it had not investigated these allegations. The findings will be hugely embarrassing for one of Britain's most successful and heavily funded sports which has enjoyed huge success at Olympics and Paralympics after discovering a seemingly endless conveyor belt of sporting talent.  The five-person panel recommended a root-and-branch review of governance, calling for  autocratic  leadership to change, staff to be better trained in equality and discrimination and that future funding be made conditional on implementation of its recommendations. Related CoverageHow the wheels came off British CyclingIt also called for better monitoring of the WCP by UK Sport. The review was jointly commissioned by British Cycling and UK Sport last April after former British Olympian Jess Varnish made allegations of bullying and sexism against Sutton after she was dropped from the team. Other riders also made allegations against Sutton, which he denied. The Australian was suspended but immediately quit. An internal inquiry by the British Cycling Board upheld an allegation that Sutton referred to female riders in insulting terms. The five-strong panel, led by British Rowing chairwoman Annamarie Phelps, said a  power pocket  was created around Sutton following his appointment as technical director in 2014.   Although Shane Sutton has an innate ability to coach riders to medal-winning performances, the Panel heard from numerous contributors that he did not possess the necessary skill-set to lead the WCP,  it said. British Cycling's chairman, Jonathan Browning, said he accepted the report's findings.  We accept, in full, the recommendations and apologize for where we have failed or fallen short,  he said.  Our structures and procedures, especially at the leadership level within the World Class Programme were lacking.   Since the findings were shared with us, we have rapidly made major changes to the WCP and to our leadership, operations and governance so that we can ensure that British Cycling learns these lessons and becomes a world-class governing body.  UK Sport said:  UK Sport acknowledges the need for greater oversight of World Class Programmes, with a particular focus on culture and duty of care.  The CIR said it had accepted 180 written contributions, conducted 44 interviews and considered 11 files of documentation.  Part of the CIR is redacted and some of its language and conclusions are different from those of a draft report which was leaked to the Daily Mail in March.

Barclay, whose formal title is economic secretary to the treasury, is likely to be responsible for financial services policy and the government's relationship with firms such as banks, insurers and asset managers. Before he was elected to parliament in 2010, Barclay worked in financial regulation and then financial crime prevention at Barclays retail bank, according to his website. A lawyer by training, he supported leaving the EU at last year's referendum. Banks, trading platforms, insurers and asset managers in London are already making plans to open new bases in other parts of the EU, fearing a loss of access to the single market after March 2019 when Britain is due to leave the bloc.  His appointment comes at a time when the City's voice must be heard loud and clear,  a City of London Corporation spokeswoman said. Barclay's experience in financial services will come as a relief after his predecessor, Simon Kirby, who lost his seat in last week's general election, dismayed the sector for having too little knowledge of finance at a critical time.  A good appointment to key role in HM Treasury,  tweeted Mark Hoban, a former City minister who heads a City-based group looking at how financial services can adapt to Brexit. The return of a minority government in last week's election has raised hope in the financial sector for a  softer  Brexit, meaning some access to the EU market would be maintained. As City minister, Kirby had been stripped of his remit in overseeing the impact of Brexit on Britain's large banking sector, a role handed to Lucy Neville-Rolfe, who quit this week.

In contrast to most drugs that are chemically synthesized, many biologics are produced using living cells. They are seen as a promising answer in cardiovascular, neurology and cancer diseases. Experts say they also provide means to treat a variety of medical illnesses and conditions that have no other treatments available. But they are also more expensive than traditional products. In March, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Sanofi's biologic drug for eczema, Dupixent, that will sell for a list price of $37,000 a year. Philippe Luscan, executive vice president of global industrial affairs at the French drugmaker, told reporters on Wednesday the investments would follow 3.3 billion euros already spent in this area in the last five years - representing the lion's share of total investment in production of 4.7 billion euros.  Earlier this year, Sanofi and Swiss manufacturer Lonza said they would spend 270 million euros by 2020 on a new large-scale biologics facility that will produce monoclonal antibodies.  In 2012, 43 percent of our pipeline was made of biologics. The figure stood at around 60 percent in 2016 and in 2020, it will increase even more,  Luscan said. Figures compiled by EvaluatePharma show conventional drugs still represented 70 percent of the top 100 medications sold worldwide before 2010, but that the proportion would narrow to 50 percent as soon as around 2022. Such projections do not automatically translate into higher volume sales for drugmakers because of a high potential for production problems and patent disputes in a competitive segment of the industry. In addition, the U.S. Supreme Court cut the time it will take for copycat versions of biologic drugs to get to the market in a pivotal ruling on Monday. The ruling has major implications for the pharmaceutical sector because it will dictate how long brand-name makers of biologic drugs can keep near-copies, called biosimilars, off the market.  Sanofi had no immediate comment on the ruling. Editing by Andrew Callus","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-sanofi-biologics-idUSKBN1951IV"},

We feel big brother omnipresent,  Lee Wei Ling and Lee Hsien Yang said in a joint news release and an accompanying six-page statement issued at 2 am Singapore time. As a result, Lee Hsien Yang and his wife, Lee Suet Fern, would be leaving Singapore.  I have no desire to leave. Hsien Loong is the only reason for my departure,  he said.  We feel hugely uncomfortable and closely monitored in our own country,  they said, in a rare public display of discord at the top of a city state that usually keeps such matters behind closed doors. In a statement, the prime minister denied the allegations made by his siblings, and said he was very disappointed that they have chosen to publicize private family matters.  I'm deeply saddened by the unfortunate allegations that they have made,  he said.  While siblings may have differences, I believe that any such differences should stay in the family,  added Lee, who is overseas on holiday with his family. At the heart of the family dispute is whether a house in which their father, Lee Kuan Yew, lived most of his life should be demolished. He was the first prime minister of Singapore and ruled the country for three decades. Before he died in 2015, the founding father of modern Singapore made it public that he wanted the house, a humbly furnished home with retro furniture near the bustling Orchard shopping district, demolished.

Qatar's Foreign Ministry did not give a reason for the move but it comes as Doha faces a diplomatic crisis with some of its Arab neighbors. They cut ties a week ago, accusing Qatar of backing Islamists and Iran, something Doha strongly denies.  Qatar has been an impartial diplomatic mediator in resolving crises and disputes between brotherly and friendly countries and will continue to be a major player in the international community,  the ministry said in a statement. It did not specify the number of troops affected but said it had informed Djibouti's government of the withdrawal.  According to a U.N. monitoring group, Qatar had said around 200 troops were stationed there. Qatar, which has had close ties with Eritrea, deployed a small contingent of peacekeepers along the border between the Horn of Africa neighbors in 2010 after clashes broke out over disputed territory in June 2008.  It also helped mediate a peace deal. Djibouti downgraded ties with Qatar last week, saying it was acting in  solidarity with the international coalition combating terrorism and extremist violence, as well as with the Gulf and Arab countries .  Eritrea's Information Ministry said on Monday the decision by Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt to sever ties was a move  in the right direction . It is the second time that Qatari troops have come home since the rift among Gulf states began. A Qatari contingent stationed in Saudi Arabia as part of the Saudi-led coalition fighting the Iran-aligned Houthis in Yemen returned last week. The forces had been stationed in the south of the kingdom to reinforce Saudi defenses against Mouth attacks.  Saudi Arabia had said Doha was expelled from the coalition set up in 2015 to fight the Mouth group that controls much of northern Yemen.

It gave no reasons for the move, but Djibouti had earlier downgraded its diplomatic ties with Qatar after the Gulf move against Doha. Erdogan, in Turkey's strongest comments since the rift began on June 5, denounced the isolation of Qatar as a violation of Islamic values and akin to a  death penalty . The measures against Qatar, which has a population of 2.7 million people but vast gas wealth, have disrupted imports of food and other materials and caused some foreign banks to scale back business.

No Demands Yet Gulf Arab states have not made public any demands on Qatar but a journalist with the state-funded Al Jazeera network has shared a list that includes Qatar severing diplomatic ties with Iran and expelling members of the Palestinian Hamas group and the Muslim Brotherhood who live in Doha.

Talpa said late on Tuesday it would offer 6.50 euros in cash per share. Mediahuis and its partner VP Exploitatie (VPE) said only that they had taken note of de Mol's offer. Their offer values TMG at around 274 million euros. The Mediahuis-led consortium already holds a 60 percent stake in TMG, notably via the Van Puijenbroek family, which has held shares in De Telegraaf since the 1950s. Its offer in April received the backing of TMG's supervisory board. Mediahuis, which already owns Dutch daily NRC Handelsblad as well as several Flemish newspapers in Belgium, and TMG want to build a Dutch-Belgian multimedia company with a continued focus on the core news division. TMG also owns Sky Radio and other entertainment channels which would complement assets already held by de Mol's Talpa Media Holding such as the Dutch arm of SBS broadcasting. TMG said it is studying the situation and will update the market later on. Its shares were down 1.4 percent 6.359 euros at 1100 GMT. The chances of a successful offer by Talpa are  very slim , KBC Securities analyst Ruben Devos wrote in a note to investors, citing the strategic shareholding of Mediahuis/VPE and the board's backing of their offer. De Mol's Talpa Holding has built a rival 25 percent stake in TMG, which he had earlier pledged not to sell, effectively blocking Mediahuis' plan to reach the 95 percent threshold required to initiate buy-out proceedings and take the company private.

In contrast to most drugs that are chemically synthesized, many biologics are produced using living cells. They are seen as a promising answer in cardiovascular, neurology and cancer diseases. Experts say they also provide means to treat a variety of medical illnesses and conditions that have no other treatments available. But they are also more expensive than traditional products. In March, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Sanofi's biologic drug for eczema, Dupixent, that will sell for a list price of $37,000 a year. Philippe Luscan, executive vice president of global industrial affairs at the French drugmaker, told reporters on Wednesday the investments would follow 3.3 billion euros already spent in this area in the last five years - representing the lion's share of total investment in production of 4.7 billion euros.  Earlier this year, Sanofi and Swiss manufacturer Lonza said they would spend 270 million euros by 2020 on a new large-scale biologics facility that will produce monoclonal antibodies.  In 2012, 43 percent of our pipeline was made of biologics. The figure stood at around 60 percent in 2016 and in 2020, it will increase even more,  Luscan said. Figures compiled by EvaluatePharma show conventional drugs still represented 70 percent of the top 100 medications sold worldwide before 2010, but that the proportion would narrow to 50 percent as soon as around 2022. Such projections do not automatically translate into higher volume sales for drugmakers because of a high potential for production problems and patent disputes in a competitive segment of the industry. In addition, the U.S. Supreme Court cut the time it will take for copycat versions of biologic drugs to get to the market in a pivotal ruling on Monday. The ruling has major implications for the pharmaceutical sector because it will dictate how long brand-name makers of biologic drugs can keep near-copies, called biosimilars, off the market.  Sanofi had no immediate comment on the ruling. Editing by Andrew Callus","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/sanofi-biologics-idUSL8N1JB23X"},

The Luxembourg-based Court of Justice of the EU (ECJ) said Pirate Bay's role as a host meant it may be liable for web piracy.  Making available and managing an online platform for sharing copyright-protected works, such as 'The Pirate Bay,' may constitute an infringement of copyright,  judges said.  Even if the works in question are placed online by the users of the online sharing platform, the operators of that platform play an essential role in making those works available,  they said. Pirate Bay could not immediately be reached for comment. The court ruling came after Dutch industry group Stichting Brein asked a Dutch court to order internet service providers XS4LL and Ziggo, which is owned by Liberty Global, to block Pirate Bay.

The central bank on Wednesday lowered the key deposit rate to 4.50 percent from 4.75 percent, following last month's cut of 25 basis points. Iceland recently lifted capital controls imposed in the wake of the 2008 crisis, but the country of 340,000 people expects about 2.4 million visitors this year, up from fewer than half a million in 2009. The tourism boom has helped economic growth in recent years but has also increased the risk of overheating, and pushed the currency up to levels where it hurts exports as well as companies competing with foreigners in the domestic market.  Clear signs of demand pressures in the economy call for a tight monetary stance so as to ensure medium-term price stability,  the central bank said.  However, the increase in the Bankâs real rate since the last MPC (Monetary Policy Committee) meeting entails a somewhat tighter stance than the Committee both had intended and considers sufficient to support price stability.  It added that inflation is  broadly  in line with the past six months, although  underlying inflation appears to have subsided in recent months . The country's economy shrank 1.9 percent in the first quarter, the biggest quarterly decline in three years, due amongst other things to the negative impact of the strong crown currency. The government plans to increase the VAT on tourism to tame the crown, and has also created a task force to review the monetary policy, including the possibility of a currency peg.  If the exchange rate continues to appreciate quite strongly, there's probably scope for another one or two rate cuts later in the year,  economist Stephen Brown from Capital Economics told Reuters.

With its unprecedented 2.3 trillion euro ($2.6 trillion) bond buying scheme set to run until year's end, the ECB will have to decide this autumn whether to keep on buying to prop up a still weak inflation rate or start winding down the program.  Conservative countries led by Germany, the bloc's biggest economy, have long opposed the scheme arguing that its effect is questionable while risks are underestimated. With growth on its best run in a decade, they say the time has come for the ECB to step back. Jens Weidmann, president of the powerful Bundesbank, argued that the ECB, now a top creditor to euro zone governments, is at risk of coming under political pressure because any hint of policy tightening poses the risk of pushing yields higher and blowing a hole in national budgets.  At the end of the day, this can lead to political pressure being exerted on the Eurosystem to maintain the very accommodative monetary policy for longer than appropriate from a price stability standpoint,  Weidmann told a conference on Wednesday.  After all, in the context of these asset purchases, changes in monetary policy impact more directly on governments' funding costs than interest rate moves,  he added. At its June meeting the ECB did not even discuss winding down its asset purchasing scheme - a process known as tapering - but hawks want that to begin relatively soon, starting in 2018.  Analysts say there is a chance that when the ECB meets in September it could opt to continue buying bonds beyond the end of this year, perhaps at lower volumes.  That would allow the bank to keep its options open rather than commit to a firm, if relatively distant, date in the future. Impact on Inflation Dutch central bank chief Klaas Knot argues that the impact of the scheme on inflation has been negligible so far, even if it has helped growth.  I think the effect (of asset buys) has been there in keeping the economic recovery going,  Knot told Dutch lawmakers on Wednesday.  But the effect on inflation has just been what you'd call disappointing. Full stop.   If you look at core inflation... then actually inflation has been flat for four years, flat as a pancake, and so you can barely observe any effect,  Knot said. Research published by the ECB on Tuesday argued that the initial launch of the scheme in 2015 is having an increasing impact on inflation. While the boost was negligible in early 2015, this grew to 0.18 percentage points by the end of 2015 and 0.36 percentage points in the fourth quarter of 2016. Having flirted with deflation for years, price growth is now comfortably above 1 percent but is not expected to reach the ECB's target of almost 2 percent at least through 2019. While the measures seem to be working much more slowly than the ECB had hoped, Estonian central bank chief Ardo Hansson,  also considered a hawk on the rate setting Governing Council, argued that this is no justification fore more stimulus.  We can't expect that there would be a very quick transition from monetary policy decisions to inflation,  Hansson told Reuters in Tallinn.  We believe generally that the real economy is firming up and if we believe in these measures, then we should be just a bit more patient.   We don't necessarily need to think that more measures are necessary. They will work their way through the system,  Hansson said.  Defending the ECB's measures, Vice President Vitor Constancio said that policymakers still don't see a convincing and self-sustaining rise toward the ECB's inflation target.

File-sharing websites such as Pirate Bay and Torrentz have angered music and film companies by providing a platform where users can illegally share films and videos over the internet, costing content providers millions of euros in lost revenue. The Luxembourg-based Court of Justice of the EU (ECJ) said Pirate Bay's role as a host meant it may be liable for web piracy.  Making available and managing an online platform for sharing copyright-protected works, such as 'The Pirate Bay,' may constitute an infringement of copyright,  judges said.  Even if the works in question are placed online by the users of the online sharing platform, the operators of that platform play an essential role in making those works available,  they said. Pirate Bay could not immediately be reached for comment. The court ruling came after Dutch industry group Stichting Brein asked a Dutch court to order internet service providers XS4LL and Ziggo, which is owned by Liberty Global, to block Pirate Bay. The Dutch court subsequently asked for the ECJ's guidance. The case is C-610/15 Stichting Brein v Ziggo BV, XS4ALL Internet BV.

The Supreme Court ruled on whether it was unlawful for the National Health Service (NHS) in England to deny free terminations to women from Northern Ireland where abortion laws are much stricter than in the rest of the United Kingdom. While the NHS provides free abortions to women in most of the United Kingdom, abortion is only permitted in Northern Ireland if a woman's life is at risk or if there is a risk of permanent and serious damage to her health. The appeal was brought by a woman from Northern Ireland who was 15 when she became pregnant and her mother, who traveled to Manchester in England and paid 900 pounds ($1,145) for an abortion.  The appeal was rejected by three judges while two supported the challenge. Women's rights groups, some of which gave evidence in the case, expressed disappointment at the verdict and said the judgment showed the emotional and financial hardship women in Northern Ireland faced because of the current rules.  The provision of free access to abortion services for all UK citizens would be a small change that would make a real difference to women who may otherwise struggle to afford the cost of private treatment,  Ruairi Rowan, senior advocacy officer in Northern Ireland at the Family Planning Association charity, said. As a result of the verdict, women without money  can continue unwanted or non-viable pregnancies, risk prosecution by taking safe but illegal early medical abortion pills sourced online, or do more dangerous things in attempt to self-harm,  Mara Clarke, director of the Abortion Support Network, which helps women fund abortions in England, said in a statement. Political parties in Northern Ireland are divided on abortion.  The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), which is in talks with Prime Minister Theresa May to support her minority government, is among the most socially conservative in Europe and has consistently opposed widespread access to abortion. Women's rights groups estimate that around 1,000 women travel to Britain each year for terminations, which they must finance themselves along with travel and other costs. Clinics in England charge around 600 pounds to terminate pregnancies of less than 14 weeks and up to 2,000 pounds for more advanced pregnancies, court documents showed.

But none over a statue. Then on a TV show last month, she criticized the removal of a Lady Justice statue, wrapped in a traditional sari, from the Supreme Court premises - a move prompted by Islamist groups protesting it was a religious object. Kamal lashed back that mosques must also not be permitted then, sparking threats from a radical Islamist group.  I have made enemies in many places,  she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by telephone from Bangladesh.  People have many reasons to come after me - because I talk about land grabbing, because I talk about the rights of indigenous people, of crimes against minorities. The majority groups, the fundamentalists don't like it.  Kamal, who until recently ran Dhaka-based human rights organization Ain o Salish Kendra, has been a vocal critic of the government's failure to protect the rights of minority groups and, increasingly, activists like herself. Rights activists in the South Asian country face judicial harassment, arbitrary arrest, fabricated charges, abduction, attacks, torture and extrajudicial killings, according to Front Line Defenders, an advocacy group headquartered in Dublin. Violations against activists are committed by state and non-state actors, and in most cases go unpunished, it said.  The government does not put the rights of people first,  said Kamal, who campaigned for the country's liberation in the 1960s and 1970s, and now advocates for the protection of the fragile Sundarbans coastal mangrove forests. Activists warn the proposed construction of power plants near the Sundarbans would damage the environment and affect the livelihoods of millions. Some protests against the projects have turned violent. Kamal is also fighting for the rights of tens of thousands of indigenous people displaced from their traditional lands in the Chittagong Hill Tracts region.  Activists say the government has failed to honor an agreement signed 20 years ago to restore their lands.  The rights of indigenous people are not recognized. They are marginalized and disadvantaged because the law does not back them,  she said.  People belonging to the majority religion, ethnic group and having the backing of political parties - that is Bangladeshi Muslim men, who are the majority - act with a certain impunity against everyone else.  Amnesty International last week called for a thorough investigation into the latest threats against Kamal and action from the government to ensure her safety. Two days after the government ordered the Lady Justice statue removed, they ordered it put back up, in a less prominent location. Kamal said the threats will not stop her work.  I am nearly 70, and I am not going to change my ways now ... I hope that others will also come forward to do this work, and I hope that the state will listen to us.

Landfills in the global financial hub of 7 million people are nearly full as the volume of waste rises for a fifth straight year and recycling lags behind other Asian cities. Tokyo, Seoul and Taipei each generate about half of Hong Kong's waste on a per capita basis, thanks to clean policies that encourage recycling, according to Hong Kong government data. During British colonial rule which ended in 1997, landfills were the primary method for disposing of the city's waste, which has increased nearly 80 percent in the last 30 years. As a result, the city's three landfills are expected to reach capacity in two years.    We are running out of space and in some areas people are moving closer and closer to the landfills,  said Christine Loh, Hong Kong's under secretary for the environment.    We can't really extend them too much more,  she said. Hong Kong's density and exorbitant land prices have hampered recycling efforts, with operators reluctant to earmark sites for recycling facilities, environmentalists said.  With most people living in tight spaces, separating different types of waste is difficult because residents simply don't have enough room.  Tracey Read, chief executive and founder of Hong Kong-based Plastic Free Seas, said mom and pop-type recycling operations were not able to cope with the huge volume of waste. A truck unloads garbage at a landfill at Tseung Kwan O district in Hong Kong, China June 9, 2017.Tyrone Siu People don't believe anything gets recycled. I think people would generally be very happy to recycle if they had confidence in the system working,  she said. Pay for Throwing Away  The government has promised new infrastructure, including a multibillion dollar incinerator to be built on one of the island's most verdant locations. Critics argue the incinerator will add to pollution, waste public money and hurt efforts to promote recycling. Loh said the incinerator was necessary to handle the average of 1.4 kg of trash every Hong Kong resident generates a day, according to official data. Slideshow (3 Images)The city is also considering a waste-charging scheme which helped to reduce waste levels by 20 percent in Taipei and Seoul.  The economic tool - to get people to understand they are going to have to pay as they throw - is very powerful,  Loh said. However, the earliest possible start date for such a program would be the end of 2019. Hong Kong's coastal waters and beaches are often strewn with rubbish from mainland China, where companies discharge waste into the sea to save the cost of proper disposal, according to conservationists. When a large amount of garbage washed up on Hong Kong's beaches last summer, Hong Kong's top official, Leung Chun-ying, said the waste was from the mainland and he led officials in a public cleanup effort. Paul Zimmerman, a Hong Kong district councilor and environmentalist, said waste management had been a low priority since the handover 20 years ago.  The government has been extremely slow,  he said.   They have been preoccupied with political reform, constitutional development and then kind of ignored the mundane issues of running a city smartly.

Gulf Arab states including Saudi Arabia have historically financed infrastructure projects but while they still help with the cost of some, the oil price slump has forced them to slash spending and to consider bringing in private investment. The King Hamad Causeway is expected to cost $4 billion to $5 billion, according to sources who attended an industry consultation event in Manama, and the two nations hope private firms and the state can share the costs, risks and profits. The meeting in Manama was attended by officials from the transportation ministries in the two countries and more than 150 companies that are expected to build the project using the public private partnership (PPP) model. The existing 25 km (16 mile) King Fahd causeway between the two countries has been open since 1986 and had average daily traffic of 31,000 passengers in 2016. But that is expected to double by 2030, the document distributed at the meeting showed. Besides a new four-lane road causeway running parallel to the existing one, there will be a new 70 km railway connecting a passenger terminal in Salmabad and freight facilities at Khalifa bin Salman port in Bahrain to the Saudi railway system. Eight million passengers per year are expected to use the rail link by 2050 and some 600,000 containers and 13 million tonnes of bulk freight are expected to be transported by the railway, which could be developed under a design, build transfer, or design, build, maintain and transfer basis. While the project's technical details were clearly described in the document, key details of the PPP structure were still preliminary, said one of the sources. The project is expected to be owned by the private sector through a new company with a 25-30-year PPP arrangement. Private sector developers, co-investors, contractors and lenders should express their interest in the project by June 29, the document said. Advisers will be appointed in the first quarter of 2018 and pre-qualification requests are due to be issued in the second quarter of next year.

Landfills in the global financial hub of 7 million people are nearly full as the volume of waste rises for a fifth straight year and recycling lags behind other Asian cities. Tokyo, Seoul and Taipei each generate about half of Hong Kong's waste on a per capita basis, thanks to clean policies that encourage recycling, according to Hong Kong government data. During British colonial rule which ended in 1997, landfills were the primary method for disposing of the city's waste, which has increased nearly 80 percent in the last 30 years. As a result, the city's three landfills are expected to reach capacity in two years.    We are running out of space and in some areas people are moving closer and closer to the landfills,  said Christine Loh, Hong Kong's under secretary for the environment.    We can't really extend them too much more,  she said. Hong Kong's density and exorbitant land prices have hampered recycling efforts, with operators reluctant to earmark sites for recycling facilities, environmentalists said.  With most people living in tight spaces, separating different types of waste is difficult because residents simply don't have enough room.  Tracey Read, chief executive and founder of Hong Kong-based Plastic Free Seas, said mom and pop-type recycling operations were not able to cope with the huge volume of waste. A truck unloads garbage at a landfill at Tseung Kwan O district in Hong Kong, China June 9, 2017.Tyrone Siu People don't believe anything gets recycled. I think people would generally be very happy to recycle if they had confidence in the system working,  she said. Pay for Throwing Away  The government has promised new infrastructure, including a multibillion dollar incinerator to be built on one of the island's most verdant locations. Critics argue the incinerator will add to pollution, waste public money and hurt efforts to promote recycling. Loh said the incinerator was necessary to handle the average of 1.4 kg of trash every Hong Kong resident generates a day, according to official data. Slideshow (3 Images)The city is also considering a waste-charging scheme which helped to reduce waste levels by 20 percent in Taipei and Seoul.  The economic tool - to get people to understand they are going to have to pay as they throw - is very powerful,  Loh said. However, the earliest possible start date for such a program would be the end of 2019. Hong Kong's coastal waters and beaches are often strewn with rubbish from mainland China, where companies discharge waste into the sea to save the cost of proper disposal, according to conservationists. When a large amount of garbage washed up on Hong Kong's beaches last summer, Hong Kong's top official, Leung Chun-ying, said the waste was from the mainland and he led officials in a public cleanup effort. Paul Zimmerman, a Hong Kong district councilor and environmentalist, said waste management had been a low priority since the handover 20 years ago.  The government has been extremely slow,  he said.   They have been preoccupied with political reform, constitutional development and then kind of ignored the mundane issues of running a city smartly.

With its unprecedented 2.3 trillion euro ($2.6 trillion) bond buying scheme set to run until year's end, the ECB will have to decide this autumn whether to keep on buying to prop up a still weak inflation rate or start winding down the program.  Conservative countries led by Germany, the bloc's biggest economy, have long opposed the scheme arguing that its effect is questionable while risks are underestimated. With growth on its best run in a decade, they say the time has come for the ECB to step back. Jens Weidmann, president of the powerful Bundesbank, argued that the ECB, now a top creditor to euro zone governments, is at risk of coming under political pressure because any hint of policy tightening poses the risk of pushing yields higher and blowing a hole in national budgets.  At the end of the day, this can lead to political pressure being exerted on the Eurosystem to maintain the very accommodative monetary policy for longer than appropriate from a price stability standpoint,  Weidmann told a conference on Wednesday.  After all, in the context of these asset purchases, changes in monetary policy impact more directly on governments' funding costs than interest rate moves,  he added. At its June meeting the ECB did not even discuss winding down its asset purchasing scheme - a process known as tapering - but hawks want that to begin relatively soon, starting in 2018.  Analysts say there is a chance that when the ECB meets in September it could opt to continue buying bonds beyond the end of this year, perhaps at lower volumes.  That would allow the bank to keep its options open rather than commit to a firm, if relatively distant, date in the future. Impact on Inflation Dutch central bank chief Klaas Knot argues that the impact of the scheme on inflation has been negligible so far, even if it has helped growth.  I think the effect (of asset buys) has been there in keeping the economic recovery going,  Knot told Dutch lawmakers on Wednesday.  But the effect on inflation has just been what you'd call disappointing. Full stop.   If you look at core inflation... then actually inflation has been flat for four years, flat as a pancake, and so you can barely observe any effect,  Knot said. Research published by the ECB on Tuesday argued that the initial launch of the scheme in 2015 is having an increasing impact on inflation. While the boost was negligible in early 2015, this grew to 0.18 percentage points by the end of 2015 and 0.36 percentage points in the fourth quarter of 2016. Having flirted with deflation for years, price growth is now comfortably above 1 percent but is not expected to reach the ECB's target of almost 2 percent at least through 2019. While the measures seem to be working much more slowly than the ECB had hoped, Estonian central bank chief Ardo Hansson,  also considered a hawk on the rate setting Governing Council, argued that this is no justification fore more stimulus.  We can't expect that there would be a very quick transition from monetary policy decisions to inflation,  Hansson told Reuters in Tallinn.  We believe generally that the real economy is firming up and if we believe in these measures, then we should be just a bit more patient.   We don't necessarily need to think that more measures are necessary. They will work their way through the system,  Hansson said.  Defending the ECB's measures, Vice President Vitor Constancio said that policymakers still don't see a convincing and self-sustaining rise toward the ECB's inflation target.

But its headline-grabbing deals and the connections forged by chairman Wu Xiaohui - from Beijing to President Donald Trump's son-in-law - have invited closer scrutiny. On Wednesday, the privately held company said Wu had temporarily stepped aside, following unverified reports of his detention in China. It has not provided further details. Wu, who married the grand-daughter of late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, has been the driving force at Anbang since founding the company in 2004. The group worked in obscurity before turning to more aggressive financing to catapult it over rivals who rake in much larger volumes of premiums.  Over the past three years, Anbang has secured acquisitions worth more than $30 billion - a diverse list that has raised regulatory questions at home and abroad. As queries grew, the low-profile Wu made more public appearances this year at key events including the annual Boao Forum, China's answer to the Davos World Economic Forum.   On one panel there he playfully sparred with Levin Zhu, the politically powerful former CEO of China International Capital Corp and a former Anbang director, who repeatedly questioned him on the company's finances, attendees reported.  Anbang's rise to international prominence has been much like that of modern China itself - meteoric, with mystical origins, and often misunderstood,  said Brock Silvers, managing director of Kaiyuan Capital, a Shanghai-based investment advisory firm.   The company was continuously dogged by rumors regarding its capital origins, yet continued to succeed,  he added. Hard-Driving, Hands-on Known for his hard-driving, hands-on approach and single-minded ambition, Wu is not the first high-profile executive reported to be targeted or questioned by Chinese authorities. China-born billionaire Xiao Jianhua was taken from a luxury Hong Kong hotel in a wheelchair in January, a source told Reuters. Local media reported the group that took him away were mainland Chinese agents, which Chinese authorities have not commented on.  Fosun chairman Guo Guangchang reportedly lost contact with the healthcare-to-insurance conglomerate in 2015 before re-emerging to say he was assisting authorities in a probe. Wu says he works at least 12 hours a day, and those working with him say calls from Wu at all hours of the day or night are not uncommon. Occasionally, he sleeps in his office. FILE PHOTO: Chairman of Anbang Insurance Group Wu Xiaohui attends the China Development Forum in Beijing, China March 18, 2017.Thomas Peter/File Photo We must win the first battle and every battle thereafter as we are representing Chinese enterprises going global,  Wu, now 51, told students at Harvard University in 2015.  We must have conviction that we can make profit even under the worst case scenario in order to move forward on each investment.  Deal or No Deal Many of Anbang's latest deals, though, have faltered. The Beijing-based firm in 2016 offered $14 billion for U.S. hotel operator Starwood but pulled out from what would have been the largest Chinese takeover of a U.S. company. A year later, it held talks with Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law, to develop a New York office tower. That deal foundered amid controversy over the extended family of the U.S. president selling to a politically connected Chinese tycoon. Anbang's $1.6 billion offer for U.S. annuities and life insurer Fidelity & Guaranty Life fell through in April. Anbang had separately sought to list its life insurance business in Hong Kong and invited banks last August to pitch for the deal, sources familiar with the matter said at the time. That too went quiet. Wu's strategy echoed that of famed U.S. investor Warren Buffett - an aggressive pursuit of yield-producing companies, funded by cash from selling insurance products and other sources.  In addition to his international deals, Wu also bought significant stakes in a number of Chinese banks and financial companies. He also aligned with powerful allies. When he set up Anbang, Wu enlisted a small consortium of private and state investors, led by Shanghai Automotive Industry Group Corp (SAIC), the parent of a government-owned automaker. State-owned China Petrochemical Corp later bought a stake. In addition to Levin Zhu, Anbang's original board included Long Yongtu, China's chief negotiator when it joined the World Trade Organization. Wu also turned to Chen Xiaolu, a son of Chinese Marshal Chen Yi, for support. One source who has advised Anbang said Wu worked hard to cultivate connections with politically connected figures and princelings, the children of the country's political elite, including the Deng family.   Even if you marry a princeling, that doesn't necessarily mean you are a full member of the family,  the source said.

The joint warning from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Bureau of Investigation said that  cyber actors of the North Korean government,  referred to in the report as  Hidden Cobra,  had targeted the media, aerospace and financial sectors, as well as critical infrastructure, in the United States and globally. The new level of detail about the U.S. government's analysis of suspected North Korean hacking activity coincides with increasing tensions between Washington and Pyongyang because of  North Korea's missile tests. The alert warned that North Korea would continue to rely on cyber operations to advance its military and strategic objectives. North Korea has routinely denied involvement in cyber attacks against other countries. The North Korean mission to the United Nations was not immediately available for comment.  Tuesday's alert said Hidden Cobra has been previously referred to by private sector experts as Lazarus Group and Guardians of the Peace, which have been linked to attacks such as the 2014 intrusion into Sony Corp's (6758.T) Sony Pictures Entertainment. Symantec Corp (SYMC.O) and Kaspersky Lab both said last month it was  highly likely  that Lazarus was behind the WannaCry ransomware attack that infected more than 300,000 computers worldwide, disrupting operations at hospitals, banks and schools. The alert did not identify specific Hidden Cobra victims. It said the group had compromised a range of victims and that some intrusions had resulted in thefts of data while others were disruptive. The group's capabilities include denial of service attacks, which send reams of junk traffic to a server to knock it offline, keystroke logging, remote access tools and several variants of malware, the alert said. John Hultquist, a cyber intelligence analyst with FireEye Inc (FEYE.O), said that his firm was concerned about increasingly aggressive cyber attacks from North Korea. The North Korea flag flutters next to concertina wire at the North Korean embassy in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia March 9, 2017.Edgar SuThe hacks include cyber espionage at South Korean finance, energy and transportation firms that appears to be reconnaissance ahead of other attacks that would be disruptive or destructive, he said.   It suggests they are preparing for something fairly significant,  he added.     Hidden Cobra commonly targets systems that run older versions of Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) operating systems that are no longer patched, the alert said, and also used vulnerabilities in Adobe Systems Inc's (ADBE.O) Flash software to gain access into targeted computers. The report urged organizations to upgrade to current versions of Adobe Flash and Microsoft Silverlight or, when possible, uninstall those applications altogether.  Microsoft said it an emailed statement that it had  addressed  the Silverlight issue in a January 2016 software update. Adobe said via email that it patched the vulnerabilities in June 2016. North Korean hacking activity has grown increasingly hostile in recent years, according to Western officials and cyber security experts. The alert arrived on the same day that North Korea released an American university student who had been held captive by Pyongyang for 17 months.  Otto Warmbier, 22, was on his way back to the United States on Tuesday but in a coma and in urgent need of medical care, according to Bill Richardson, a veteran former diplomat and politician who has played a role in past negotiations with North Korea.  The U.S. government seeks to arm network defenders with the tools they need to identify, detect and disrupt North Korean government malicious cyber activity that is targeting our country's and our alliesâ networks,  a DHS official said about the alert. The official was not authorized to speak publicly.

Africa's most developed economy slipped into recession in the first quarter, compounding a slew of negative economic indicators including sovereign rating downgrades and stubbornly high unemployment.  Already we've got a lot of accounts, more than a third, that are impaired and the percentages might go up. So we are worried,  Nomsa Motshegare, the NCR chief executive told Reuters.  There must be responsible borrowing but also responsible lending,  she said after briefing parliament where changes to the National Credit Act were being considered to help relieve over-indebted consumers. Motshegare said at the end of December, there were around 24 million active credit consumers, with 40 percent, or just under 10 million people, having some form of  impaired record  of payment. Unbridled lending fueled a consumer frenzy that lifted growth to an average 5 percent annually in the period before the 2009 recession, before the government introduced legislation clamping down on irresponsible lending. The National Treasury, which has previously introduced a debt amnesty to assist poor and indebted consumers, said they were considering a number of options, including  extinguishing  some or all debt to help people get a fresh start.  If a person can pay, he or she should pay,  said Katherine Gibson, senior adviser for market conduct and inclusion at the treasury. Gibson told parliament's trade and industry committee that further research was needed to determine the impact of possible debt relief packages, which was expected to heavily impact retailers and microlenders.  It is expected to heavily impact access to credit and is likely to push desperate people to illegal operators,  she said.

Since Sunday, his at-bats have been significantly better,â Milwaukee manager Craig Counsell told reporters. âThatâs Keon.

The former Fresno State star last started on June 3 against the Los Angeles Dodgers and settled for a no-decision after allowing two runs - one earned - over four frames. Garza is 5-5 with a 3.99 ERA in 14 career starts against St. Louis, including a 1-1 mark and 3.55 ERA in two turns last season. Leake is looking to snap a three-game losing streak after allowing three runs - two earned - and a season-high 10 hits over five innings Thursday against Cincinnati. The 29-year-old has given up 12 runs and 22 hits over 18 2/3 frames in his last three outings.

Santana goes for his ninth win -- and first at home since May 2 -- when Minnesota continues its four-game series against the visiting Seattle Mariners on Wednesday night. The Twins may need another big game from Santana after using up nearly a week's worth of offense Tuesday night, setting a franchise record with 28 hits in a 20-7 drubbing of Seattle. Eddie Rosario, one of three Minnesota players with three hits, became the third player in club history to hit three homers in a game. Shortstop Eduardo Escobar collected five hits as the Twins set a franchise mark with 22 singles.

Non-traditional leadoff hitter Anthony Rizzo and the Cubs hope to remain hot at the plate when they visit the New York Mets for the finale of their three-game series on Wednesday. Rizzo led off Tuesday's game with a home run and finished 2-for-4 with three RBIs in a 14-3 victory. The Cubs belted a season-high five homers and scored more runs than they totaled in their previous nine road games - all losses. The rout ended an impressive stretch for Mets pitchers, who had allowed just one run in each contest during a four-game winning streak. New York will need a lengthy outing from Matt Harvey after taxing the bullpen on Tuesday, as Zack Wheeler didnât get out of the second inning and the team burned its long relievers.

The 27-year-old gave up two runs and three hits in four innings of a no-decision against Colorado on Friday, as three walks and a number of deep counts helped cut his outing short. Montgomery never has faced the Mets in his career. Harvey has been inconsistent through 12 turns, posting only four quality starts while allowing five or more runs four times. The 28-year-old was excellent Friday at Atlanta, allowing four hits over five scoreless frames, but threw 104 pitches before settling for a no-decision. Harvey is 1-0 with a 1.26 ERA in two career starts against the Cubs. Walk-Offs 1. A win on Wednesday would give the Cubs their first series win on the road since taking two of three at Pittsburgh from April 24-26. 2.

Densely populated Bangladesh is battered by storms, floods and landslides every rainy season. The latest casualties come weeks after Cyclone Mora killed at least seven people and damaged tens of thousands of homes. Landslides hit three hilly districts in Bangladesh's southeast early on Tuesday, killing 100 people in Rangamati, 36 in Chittagong and six in Bandarban, saidÂ Reaz Ahmed, head of theÂ department of disasterÂ management. Fresh landslides on Wednesday killed one person in the district of Khagrachari and two in the coastal town of Cox's Bazar, he added. The town bordering Myanmar is home to thousands of Rohingya Muslim refugees and was just beginning to recover from Cyclone Mora.  Ahmed said many people were still missing in the landslide-hit districts and the death toll could rise further as rescuers search for bodies. The toll included four soldiers  trapped by a landslide during a rescue operation in Rangamati, he added.

It is a great relief. Some areas in the district are still cut off but people are being moved through navy boats,  he told Reuters by telephone from Rangamati. But weather officials in Bangladesh have forecast light to moderate showers accompanied by gusty or squally wind during the next 24 hours in places like Chittagong. In the Indian states of Mizoram and Assam, which border Bangladesh, at least 11 people were killed as incessant rains flooded major cities. Authorities in Mizoram retrieved nine bodies, but about seven people were still missing after landslides caused several homes to cave in, the state's urban development minister said. India was ready to support Bangladesh with search and rescue efforts if needed, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's office said in a statement.

That is beginning to change.            S&P; Global has begun to quiz states, cities and towns about their cyber defenses, and some credit analysts are starting to factor cyber security when they look at bonds. Moody's Investors Service is also trying to figure out how to best evaluate cyber risk.     The shift follows a particularly steep rise in ransomware attacks, when criminals hold an entity's computer system hostage until a small ransom is paid.     The number of global ransomware detections rose 36 percent in 2016 from the year before, to 463,841, with the United States most heavily affected, according to cyber security firm Symantec Corp.     Such attacks, which have also hit companies and federal entities, have spared no kind of municipal issuer large or small, from police departments to school districts and transit agencies. Ransomware attacks on state and local governments and their agencies have risen in proportion with the overall increase, according to cyber insurance provider Beazley Group.      State and local governments are a huge target, quite frankly an easy target for bad guys,  said Bob Anderson, managing director for information security at Navigant management consulting firm in Washington and a former global cyber investigator at the Federal Bureau of Investigation.      Last month's  WannaCry  ransomware attack, which hobbled global businesses and Britain's National Health Service, may also be prompting renewed focus on cyber security, though it had minimal impact in the United States.     Considering a potential cyber attack as a similar risk to a natural disaster, S&P; has already been reviewing cyber security defenses of utilities, hospitals and colleges because they were early public sector targets for hackers.     Now it is also beginning to ask cities and states about the costs and level of security measures and the financial impact of successful attacks, said Geoffrey Buswick, who manages S&P;'s public sector ratings.           HEAD IN THE SAND     The answers feed into broader categories that affect an issuer's ratings, particularly governance, liquidity and operations.     Many breaches are handled quickly and financial damage is limited, but not every attack will necessarily end that way, Buswick said.  We're trying to get sense of who has their head in the sand and who doesn't.      Fitch Ratings said it does not consider cyber security in its ratings, and many investors still are not concerned enough to ask for details.      In part, that is because it can be difficult to assess the operational and financial fallout of such attacks. Some high profile breaches so far have also done limited damage to issuers' finances.     Case in point is the state of South Carolina, which in August 2012 suffered possibly the worst cyber attack yet of any city or state.      When hackers stole the personal data of more than 3.5 million taxpayers, the state had to investigate, provide credit monitoring and consumer fraud protection, and implement a slew of post-breach upgrades, according to State Senator Thomas Alexander.     The total cost is around $76 million and counting, he said. That is enough to pay for several school programs combined. But against South Carolina's annual general fund budget of roughly $8 billion, the costs made no dent in its standing as a borrower.     Many issuers do not disclose any information to potential investors in bond documents about cyber risks or defenses. But a few, particularly hospitals and utilities, have started doing so.     In a February prospectus, the Maryland Health and Higher Educational Facilities Authority, the state's largest public debt issuer, included nearly a full page devoted to the growing risk of cyber attacks.      Because we're such a large issuer, and because healthcare is often treated much more like a corporate credit, the legal counsels to the transaction weigh in on the bondholder risk section,  said Annette Anselmi, the authority's Executive Director, noting that such disclosures also evolve depending on what kinds of questions the market is asking.     Hospitals are also ahead on cyber security disclosure because they rely on huge amounts of data, said Court Street Group analyst Joseph Krist.     Eventually, he expects others to follow suit.      We went through this with getting munis to ... disclose more pension information. Those were frankly long and painful processes. It just has to get to a critical mass.

The government must ask itself, did the general election give the prime minister the mandate for the Brexit she sought. I would suggest not,  Raymond said at the arable industry's major annual event, Cereals 2017. Britain's general election last week resulted in the ruling Conservative party losing its overall majority in parliament. It is seeking to continue governing with the support of Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  It is time the UK government took a more collaborative and consensual approach to Brexit. In my opinion it is the only way forward,  Raymond said.  It means taking a more conciliatory approach in the EU negotiations, working in better partnership with the EU to ensure an outcome which is mutually beneficial to both sides.  The farmers' leader said the most important issue for the agricultural sector was the need to ensure  continued tariff free trade and frictionless access to the single (EU) market.  He said that could take place either through a sophisticated customs agreement or continued membership of the Customs Union. The government minister responsible for farming has changed since last week's election, with Michael Gove taking over from Andrea Leadsom. Raymond said he had a 40-minute telephone conversation with Gove on Tuesday and would be meeting him on Friday. Gove is a former education and justice minister before losing his place in the government last year. He was widely seen as a reformer whose views were often controversial.  Whether he is going to be a reforming secretary of state I'm not too certain but we (now) have a very prominent member of the government at DEFRA (the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs),  Raymond said.  He is highly ambitious. Putting that all together I believe he is going to have to champion food and farming in the months ahead and the impression I had yesterday is that he is prepared to do that so I am heartened.

Still, with half a year left to go, Beijing is expected to handily meet its annual 6.5 percent economic growth target without too many bumps, good news for President Xi Jinping ahead of a major political leadership reshuffle later this year. China's fast start to the year led the International Monetary Fund on Wednesday to raise its 2017 growth outlook for the country to 6.7 percent from its 6.6 percent forecast in April, though it recommended China accelerate reforms and rein in credit. Credit and money supply data on Wednesday showed China may be making progress in the battle against risky lending and rising leverage as May bank loans topped expectations but money supply grew at the slowest annual rate in over 20 years, which the central bank attributed to deleveraging. Off-balance sheet lending, or shadow banking activity, also fell sharply in May after rising earlier in the year.  But the People's Bank of China (PBOC) said it will balance deleveraging with the need to keep liquidity basically stable, adding that slower money supply expansion could be a  new normal . Slower fixed asset investment growth in May and a sharp deceleration in housing starts seen in data on Wednesday point to some of the cooling economists have been expecting, though stable growth in factory output and retail sales, along with a pickup in exports, are cushioning the impact so far. But a rise in inventories in the industrial sector and weaker producer price inflation will drag on growth ahead, said Louis Kuijs, head of Asia economics at Oxford Economics in Hong Kong.  The first half of this year was a very happy period for China in the sense that we had that wonderful increase in output prices,  said Kuijs, referring in part to a construction boom which boosted demand and profits of structurally unhealthy sectors such as steel.  Related CoverageIMF raises China 2017 growth forecast again, partly due to 'policy support'After rolling out a slew of measures early in 2017 ranging from short-term interest rate increases to a clampdown on riskier forms of lending and shadow banking, authorities have appeared to pause in recent weeks as the government looks to ensure political and financial market stability before a Communist Party Congress in autumn. With slower nominal growth going into next year,  the willingness to tighten significantly (further) on the monetary side will be pretty low , Kuijs said.  Manufacturing Still Solid, Property Cooling Industrial output grew at a steady 6.5 percent pace in May from a year earlier, defying expectations for a slight softening, as a government infrastructure spree continues to boost demand for building materials from cement to steel. But rising inventories are a risk. In April, growth in industrial inventories picked up to over 10 percent.  Weaker growth in fixed asset investment -- at 8.6 percent for January through May -- was led by a slowdown in the property sector. While housing sales rose by an unexpectedly solid 10 percent, growth in new construction starts almost halved to 5.2 percent in May, according to Reuters calculations. Analysts expect the housing market to continue to slow, as the government remains wary of still-rising home prices and has maintained strict controls on home purchases and property financing.  Infrastructure spending, a key lever for the government to stabilize growth in the face of any slowdown, slowed to 20.9 percent growth over the first five months of the year. Growth of private investment slowed slightly to 6.8 percent in January-May, suggesting a slight weakening of the private sector's appetite to invest as small- and medium-sized private firms still face challenges in accessing financing and now rising funding costs. Retail spending was more upbeat, rising 10.7 percent from a year earlier, unchanged from April and beating analysts' expectations for a decline despite the first back-to-back drop in auto sales since 2015. Focused on the Target Economists at Nomura forecast China's economy will grow an annual 6.8 percent in the second quarter, only marginally less than the 6.9 percent in the first quarter and providing enough momentum to coast to the government's full-year target even if there is some second-half softening. Fund managers surveyed by BofA Merrill Lynch said China's credit tightening ranked as the top tail risk for financial markets for the second month in a row in June, with nearly two-thirds of respondents saying it will slow Chinese business activity but have little impact on global growth.  Sources told Reuters on Wednesday that China's central bank was checking with lenders in Shanghai to see if tighter rules were having an impact on lending or credit quality. Funding costs are rising slowly and banks have been raising mortgage rates. Still, many analysts say concerns over tighter policy are overblown as measures so far this year have been on the edges and only target financial speculation, not activity in the real economy. Despite some tightening,  broader liquidity conditions such as M2 growth, loan growth or the growth of outstanding financing are still largely stable,  said Nomura chief China economist Yang Zhao.   Further tightening should be very limited. I don't see the People's Bank of China (PBOC) easing liquidity or monetary policy anytime soon, but the PBOC probably would not further tighten.

Addressing foreign-exchange (FX) risk completely via regulation or legislation is challenging, but we believe the move towards European harmonisation presents a opportunity to examine how best to do so. The European Commission said on 8 June that it would draft a legislative proposal for an EU covered bond framework to be introduced next year, following reports by the European Banking Association and European Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. These reports acknowledge the potential risk from FX exposures, but do not make detailed recommendations on how to mitigate FX risk, beyond regular stress-testing. FX risk can arise in European covered bond programmes with open foreign-currency positions between assets and liabilities, or where cover assets are backed by security in a country with a different currency. Measures to address FX risk vary widely from country to country. Germany's Pfandbrief Act, for example, says that issuers should conduct weekly FX stress tests and publish open positions in their quarterly reporting. It also attempts to limit FX risk through its 2% minimum overcollateralisation (OC) requirement. This approach provides some transparency for investors, but the currency stresses that the Act specifies for calculating the 2% OC requirement are lower than those that Fitch uses to assess the impact of FX movements in our investment-grade rating scenarios, and do not reflect potential FX market volatility at times of stress, in our view. In practice, issuers of Pfandbriefe rated by Fitch hold OC sufficiently above the 2% minimum to meet the breakeven OC for the relevant rating. Fitch's breakeven OC for the rating of covered bond programmes exposed to open-currency positions is substantially higher than for programmes that are not. We consider FX risk a residual rather than a primary risk when the currency mismatches between assets and liabilities or within the cover pool are below thresholds set out in our criteria.

Still, with half a year left to go, Beijing is expected to handily meet its annual 6.5 percent economic growth target without too many bumps, good news for President Xi Jinping ahead of a major political leadership reshuffle later this year. China's fast start to the year led the International Monetary Fund on Wednesday to raise its 2017 growth outlook for the country to 6.7 percent from its 6.6 percent forecast in April, though it recommended China accelerate reforms and rein in credit. Credit and money supply data on Wednesday showed China may be making progress in the battle against risky lending and rising leverage as May bank loans topped expectations but money supply grew at the slowest annual rate in over 20 years, which the central bank attributed to deleveraging. Off-balance sheet lending, or shadow banking activity, also fell sharply in May after rising earlier in the year.  But the People's Bank of China (PBOC) said it will balance deleveraging with the need to keep liquidity basically stable, adding that slower money supply expansion could be a  new normal . Slower fixed asset investment growth in May and a sharp deceleration in housing starts seen in data on Wednesday point to some of the cooling economists have been expecting, though stable growth in factory output and retail sales, along with a pickup in exports, are cushioning the impact so far. But a rise in inventories in the industrial sector and weaker producer price inflation will drag on growth ahead, said Louis Kuijs, head of Asia economics at Oxford Economics in Hong Kong.  The first half of this year was a very happy period for China in the sense that we had that wonderful increase in output prices,  said Kuijs, referring in part to a construction boom which boosted demand and profits of structurally unhealthy sectors such as steel.  Related CoverageIMF raises China 2017 growth forecast again, partly due to 'policy support'After rolling out a slew of measures early in 2017 ranging from short-term interest rate increases to a clampdown on riskier forms of lending and shadow banking, authorities have appeared to pause in recent weeks as the government looks to ensure political and financial market stability before a Communist Party Congress in autumn. With slower nominal growth going into next year,  the willingness to tighten significantly (further) on the monetary side will be pretty low , Kuijs said.  Manufacturing Still Solid, Property Cooling Industrial output grew at a steady 6.5 percent pace in May from a year earlier, defying expectations for a slight softening, as a government infrastructure spree continues to boost demand for building materials from cement to steel. But rising inventories are a risk. In April, growth in industrial inventories picked up to over 10 percent.  Weaker growth in fixed asset investment -- at 8.6 percent for January through May -- was led by a slowdown in the property sector. While housing sales rose by an unexpectedly solid 10 percent, growth in new construction starts almost halved to 5.2 percent in May, according to Reuters calculations. Analysts expect the housing market to continue to slow, as the government remains wary of still-rising home prices and has maintained strict controls on home purchases and property financing.  Infrastructure spending, a key lever for the government to stabilize growth in the face of any slowdown, slowed to 20.9 percent growth over the first five months of the year. Growth of private investment slowed slightly to 6.8 percent in January-May, suggesting a slight weakening of the private sector's appetite to invest as small- and medium-sized private firms still face challenges in accessing financing and now rising funding costs. Retail spending was more upbeat, rising 10.7 percent from a year earlier, unchanged from April and beating analysts' expectations for a decline despite the first back-to-back drop in auto sales since 2015. Focused on the Target Economists at Nomura forecast China's economy will grow an annual 6.8 percent in the second quarter, only marginally less than the 6.9 percent in the first quarter and providing enough momentum to coast to the government's full-year target even if there is some second-half softening.

Petronas has plans to offer September loadings of its Kimanis crude grade next month, the industry sources said.  DME documents - updated in June and posted on the exchange's website - indicate Petronas trading arm Petco is looking to sell the Kimanis grade over the Dubai platform, although without providing any details on volumes or timing.  Petronas and DME did not respond to queries on the matter.      The move comes amid rising Kimanis crude output, with the  August loadings of the grade expected to rise to a record 12 cargoes of 600,000 barrels each.      Rising Kimanis production and an overall global surplus has pressured primary sellers of the grade, including Petronas, Royal Dutch Shell, Murphy Oil, ConocoPhillips, Petroleum Brunei and Pertamina [PERTM.UL].      Kimanis premiums plunged to their lowest in nearly two years at around $1.50 a barrel to dated Brent in April, underscoring the difficulties sellers face in the current market.   Kimanis needs to find new homes ... It's good to find new buyers apart from the usual end-users,  a trading source who markets the grade said about Petronas' DME plans.      In a DME auction, potential buyers - who have to be pre-approved by the seller - will have two minutes to place bids after the company offering a cargo has set a minimum price.   The auction does not mean a better price, but you get to set a floor price. So if you get better than the floor price, it's a good thing,  said a source involved in the auction who is not approved to discuss the matter publicly.  Four cargoes of Middle East crude have been auctioned on the DME since January 2016. DME charges a 1.5 cent per barrel fee for cargoes sold via auction.  Kimanis is one of the largest Malaysian crude output streams. The Malaysian crude price mechanism introduced in 2014 was revised in January to add Kimanis to a benchmark formula based on the Labuan, Miri Light and Kikeh grades.

Food inflation fell to 6.3 percent in May from 6.7 percent in April while non-food inflation also dipped to 15.8 percent from 16.3 percent, Wadieh said, adding that the May figure was the lowest since December 2013. The month-on-month inflation rate was 0.7 percent in May, compared to 1.6 percent the previous month. Ghana, which exports cocoa, gold and oil, said in April it was committed to reducing inflation, the public debt and budget deficit. It was one of Africa's strongest economies until 2014, when it was hit by a slump in commodity prices and a fiscal crisis.

Deutsche Post initially developed an electric minivan dubbed Streetscooter for its own operations to avoid inner-city emissions after growth in online shopping resulted in increased parcel deliveries. But in April it took on carmakers by unveiling plans to step up production and sell to other delivery firms. For the larger van, Ford will supply vehicle technology based on the Transit model, with Deutsche Post keeping assembly, distribution and sales in-house, a Germany-based Ford spokesman told Reuters. The new model is part of a plan to build another production site for the Streetscooter unit and double annual output to 20,000 vans by the end of the year.  This step emphasizes that Deutsche Post is an innovation leader. It will relieve the inner cities and increase people's quality of life,  Deutsche Post executive board member Juergen Gerdes said in a statement. Advances in manufacturing software are allowing auto industry newcomers such as Deutsche Post, Google and start-ups to tap suppliers to design, engineer and test new vehicle concepts without hiring thousands of engineering staff or investing billions in tooling and factories. Deutsche Post, which is also building a country-wide network of maintenance and repair shops, wants a fleet of at least 2,500 of the new vans on the road by the end of 2018, it said. The postal services group decided to build its own vans after it could not agree on a wider supply contract with established vehicle makers.    It is phasing out use of Volkswagen's (VOWG_p.DE) Caddy vans in favor of Streetscooters, and going it alone with the electric van project has upset VW.

Barclay, whose formal title is economic secretary to the treasury, is likely to be responsible for financial services policy and the government's relationship with firms such as banks, insurers and asset managers. Before he was elected to parliament in 2010, Barclay worked in financial regulation and then financial crime prevention at Barclays retail bank, according to his website. A lawyer by training, he supported leaving the EU at last year's referendum. Banks, trading platforms, insurers and asset managers in London are already making plans to open new bases in other parts of the EU, fearing a loss of access to the single market after March 2019 when Britain is due to leave the bloc.  His appointment comes at a time when the City's voice must be heard loud and clear,  a City of London Corporation spokeswoman said. Barclay's experience in financial services will come as a relief after his predecessor, Simon Kirby, who lost his seat in last week's general election, dismayed the sector for having too little knowledge of finance at a critical time.  A good appointment to key role in HM Treasury,  tweeted Mark Hoban, a former City minister who heads a City-based group looking at how financial services can adapt to Brexit. The return of a minority government in last week's election has raised hope in the financial sector for a  softer  Brexit, meaning some access to the EU market would be maintained. As City minister, Kirby had been stripped of his remit in overseeing the impact of Brexit on Britain's large banking sector, a role handed to Lucy Neville-Rolfe, who quit this week. A finance ministry spokeswoman said the exact responsibilities of junior finance ministers had not been finalised.

Africa's most developed economy slipped into recession in the first quarter, compounding a slew of negative economic indicators including sovereign rating downgrades and stubbornly high unemployment.  Already we've got a lot of accounts, more than a third, that are impaired and the percentages might go up. So we are worried,  Nomsa Motshegare, the NCR chief executive told Reuters.  There must be responsible borrowing but also responsible lending,  she said after briefing parliament where changes to the National Credit Act were being considered to help relieve over-indebted consumers. Motshegare said at the end of December, there were around 24 million active credit consumers, with 40 percent, or just under 10 million people, having some form of  impaired record  of payment. Unbridled lending fueled a consumer frenzy that lifted growth to an average 5 percent annually in the period before the 2009 recession, before the government introduced legislation clamping down on irresponsible lending. The National Treasury, which has previously introduced a debt amnesty to assist poor and indebted consumers, said they were considering a number of options, including  extinguishing  some or all debt to help people get a fresh start.  If a person can pay, he or she should pay,  said Katherine Gibson, senior adviser for market conduct and inclusion at the treasury. Gibson told parliament's trade and industry committee that further research was needed to determine the impact of possible debt relief packages, which was expected to heavily impact retailers and microlenders.  It is expected to heavily impact access to credit and is likely to push desperate people to illegal operators,  she said.

Together with Turkey and the United States, Qatar and Saudi Arabia have been major sponsors of the insurgency, arming an array of groups that have been fighting to topple the Iran-backed president. The Gulf support has however been far from harmonious, fuelling splits that have set back the revolt. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut diplomatic and transport ties with Qatar a week ago, accusing it of fomenting regional unrest, supporting terrorism and getting too close to Iran, all of which Doha denies. It is the biggest rift among Gulf Arab states in years.  God forbid if this crisis is not contained I predict ... the situation in Syria will become tragic because the factions that are supported by (different) countries will be forced to take hostile positions towards each other,  said Mustafa Sejari of the Liwa al Mutasem rebel group in northern Syria.  We urge our brothers in Saudi Arabia and Qatar not to burden the Syrian people more than they can bear.  The Syrian rebellion can ill afford more internal conflict.  The opposition has been losing ground to Damascus ever since the Russian military deployed to Syria in support of Assad's war effort in 2015. Assad now appears militarily unassailable, though rebels still have notable footholds near Damascus, in the northwest, and the southwest. In the fractured map of the Syrian insurgency, Qatari aid has gone to groups that are often Islamist in ideology and seen as close to the Muslim Brotherhood - a movement that is anathema to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt. Turkey, which has swung firmly behind Qatar in the Gulf crisis, is thought to have backed the same groups as Qatar in northern Syria, including the powerful conservative Islamist faction Ahrar al-Sham.    Qatar is also widely believed to have ties to al Qaeda-linked jihadists of the group once known as the Nusra Front, which has rebranded since formally parting ways with al Qaeda and is now part of the Tahrir al-Sham Islamist alliance.   FILE PHOTO: Islamist Ahrar al-Sham brigade fighters carry weapons as they demonstrate their skills during their graduation ceremony at a camp in eastern al-Ghouta, near Damascus, Syria, November 28, 2013.Diaa Al-Din/File PhotoWhile Qatar has officially denied Nusra ties, it has mediated the release of hostages held by the group including Americans, Greek Orthodox nuns and members of the Lebanese security forces.     Saudi aid has meanwhile been seen as targeted more closely at groups backed through programs run by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency - programs in which Qatar has also participated even as it has backed groups outside that channel. The United Arab Emirates has also played an influential role in that program, together with staunch U.S. ally Jordan. These powers wield more influence in southern Syria than the north. North-South Split Slideshow (2 Images) It will increase the split between north and south, as the north is mainly funded by Qatar and Turkey, and the south is supported by Jordan and the (U.S.-led) coalition,  said an opposition source familiar with foreign support to the rebels. A second opposition source, a senior rebel official, said the Gulf crisis  will certainly affect us, people are known to be with Saudi, or Qatar, or Turkey. The split is clear.  Adding to rebel concerns, the crisis has also nudged Qatar closer to Iran, which has sent planes loaded with food to Doha.  Any rapprochement between Qatar and Iran, or any other state and Iran, is very concerning for us,  the rebel official said.  A senior Turkish official said it was very important that the Qatar crisis did not take on  further dimensions .  These developments will have certain effects on the developments in Syria, its effects will be seen on the field. The elements which Qatar supports may slightly weaken on the field,  the official said. Opposition sources fear the Gulf crisis could spark new bouts of conflict, particularly in the Eastern Ghouta area near Damascus where the Saudi-backed Jaish al-Islam has been fighting the Qatari-backed Failaq al-Rahman intermittently for more than a year. That quarrel has helped government forces regain parts of the area. The four Arab states that have turned against Qatar last week issued a list of dozens of people named as terrorists with links to Qatar, including prominent Islamist insurgent Sheikh Abdullah al-Muhaysini, a Saudi national based in Syria known for mobilizing support for jihadist groups. The U.S. Treasury last year blacklisted him for acting on behalf of and supporting the Nusra Front, saying he had raised millions of dollars for the group.

The Outlooks are Stable. The issue ratings on Thailand's senior unsecured local-currency bonds have also been affirmed at 'BBB+'. The Country Ceiling has been affirmed at 'A-' and the Short-Term Foreign- and Local-Currency IDRs have been affirmed at 'F2'. The short-term issues have also been affirmed at 'F2'. KEY RATING DRIVERS Strong external finances and low public debt increases Thailand's resilience to economic shocks and underpins the country's ratings. These strengths are balanced by weaker structural factors compared with 'BBB' rated peers, such as low income per capita and weak governance indicator scores. The risk of a renewed bout of political instability, as evident during public protests in 2014, also constrains the ratings. A wider current-account surplus and higher foreign reserves have further bolstered Thailand's external finances. The current-account surplus widened to 11.5% of GDP in 2016, from an already-high 8.1% in 2015, driven by continued low energy prices and weak domestic demand. The large surplus, along with bigger capital inflows, has generated appreciation pressure on the Thai baht since the start of 2017. Interventions by the Bank of Thailand to reduce exchange rate volatility have increased foreign reserves to USD185 billion by April 2017, from USD172 billion at end-2016. The Thai economy expanded by 3.2% in 2016, in line with the 'BBB' median's 3.1%, but behind other south-east Asian peers. Government stimulus and a rebound in farm incomes have lifted growth, following a severe drought early in 2016. Fitch expects increased public investment as part of the government's infrastructure plan to push growth up to 3.4% in 2017. However, deepened protectionism or weaker global demand could be a downside risk for exports. The government is using available fiscal space to boost infrastructure spending to support medium-term growth prospects. Fitch expects the general government balance to shift from a 0.5% of GDP surplus in the fiscal year ending September 2016 (FY16), to a 1.6% deficit in FY17. The deficit remains lower than the 2.6% of GDP 'BBB' median and is consistent with the general government debt/GDP ratio stabilising at a low level relative to rating peers. The government has some contingent liabilities from quasi-fiscal activities conducted through state-owned enterprises (SOE), but Fitch does not see this exposure as unusually high despite limited transparency. The government has taken steps to improve reporting of SOE operations. The government has launched the Thailand 4.0 economic plan to improve the country's productivity and counter the effects of an aging population and declining export competitiveness on growth. Measures include reforms to improve the efficiency of SOEs, boost competition and incentivise foreign investment. However, it remains to be seen whether they will be implemented successfully and be sufficient to offset structural headwinds. Thailand's high household debt could weigh on consumption and increase the economy's vulnerability to shocks. The household debt/GDP ratio was stable over 2016, but remains high at 80%. A shock that leads to job losses or higher interest rates could hinder the ability of households to service debt, causing a rise in delinquencies and lower consumption. Banks have already started to face asset-quality pressure on unsecured retail loans and other vulnerable non-household sectors, such as small business. However, Fitch believes Thai banks' capital and liquidity positions remain adequate. Delays to the general election have added to uncertainty over the country's timing and transition back to civilian rule. The government now expects the election to be held by mid-2018. Uncertainty over the transition, including any further delays, could hold back private investment if businesses struggle to assess economic and policy direction. That said, Thailand has enjoyed a period of economic and political stability since the military government took power in 2014. SOVEREIGN RATING MODEL (SRM) and QUALITATIVE OVERLAY (QO) Fitch's proprietary SRM assigns Thailand a score equivalent to a rating of 'BBB+' on the Long-Term Foreign-Currency IDR scale. Fitch's sovereign rating committee adjusted the output from the SRM to arrive at the final Long-Term Foreign-Currency IDR by applying its QO, relative to rated peers, as follows: - Structural features: -1 notch to reflect uncertainty over the terms and timing of Thailand's transition back to civilian rule and risks to economic stability from ongoing political divisions. High household debt increases vulnerability to shocks. - External finances: +1 notch to reflect strengths in Thailand's external finances not captured in the SRM, including its large net creditor position and strong external liquidity Fitch's SRM is the agency's proprietary multiple regression rating model that employs 18 variables based on three-year centred averages, including one year of forecasts, to produce a score equivalent to a Long-Term Foreign-Currency IDR. Fitch's QO is a forward-looking qualitative framework designed to allow for adjustment to the SRM output to assign the final rating, reflecting factors within our criteria that are not fully quantifiable and/or not fully reflected in the SRM. RATING SENSITIVITIES The main factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action include: - A sustained improvement in growth above Fitch's expectations without the emergence of imbalances. - Resolution of social and political tensions sufficient in scale to improve governance and development indicators. The main factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action are: - Renewed political disruption on a scale sufficient to have a significant effect on Thailand's economy. - A large and sustained rise in Thailand's government debt ratios, for example, due to a fiscal deterioration or materialisation of contingent liabilities on the sovereign balance sheet.

The drug, designed to be injected at the site of pain, is being developed by the privately-held company run by former Pfizer Inc chief executive Jeffrey Kindler. Centrexion's drug, a man-made version of chili plant extract trans-capsaicin, is designed to work by inactivating local pain fibers transmitting signals to the brain.  The mid-stage trial tested two doses of the drug, CNTX-4975, against a placebo in 175 difficult-to-treat knee osteoarthritis patients who had failed or were unable to tolerate prior pain therapy. Osteoarthritis affects about 14 million Americans. It is   caused by the progressive breakdown and eventual loss of cartilage, and characterized by pain, swelling and decreased mobility of the affected joint.  Data showed the drug induced statistically significant pain relief as well as reduced knee stiffness and improved physical function at 24 weeks after a single injection. Patients on the 1 milligram (mg) dose experienced a reduction of 3.8 on a scale measuring daily pain with walking, versus a decline of 2.4 for those on the placebo, the company said on Tuesday. With exploding U.S. rates of abuse, overdose and addiction to opioids - a lethal family of drugs widely prescribed for pain - as well as side-effects seen with other pain treatments, developing an analgesic with little side-effects has become imperative.  The safety profile of CNTX-4975 was comparable to that of a placebo, chief medical officer Randall Stevens said, adding that the medicine is cleared out of the body 24 hours after it is injected.  When you eat a hot chili meal, you're consuming about 25 mg of capsaicin. So the systemic exposure from the meal is actually higher,  he told Reuters.  The Boston-based company, which is developing various non-opioid painkillers, expects to initiate a late-stage study later this year for CNTX-4975.   The drug is also being evaluated to treat patients with Morton's neuroma pain as well as canine osteoarthritis.

Tillerson told a Senate hearing on Tuesday he had received reassurances from President Mahmoud Abbas that the Palestinian Authority would end the practice of paying a monthly stipend to the families of suicide bombers and other attackers, commonly referred to by Palestinians as martyrs. The issue of compensation has become a sticking point in efforts to revive Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, with Israeli officials citing it as one reason they do not regard Abbas as a  partner for peace .  They have changed their policy,  Tillerson said, referring to the Palestinians.  At least I have been informed they've changed that policy and their intent is to cease payments.  But Palestinian officials said they were not aware of any change and that it was unlikely a policy that has been a cornerstone of social support for decades would be altered.  There have been talks about making the payments in a different way, but not ending them,  said one official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment on discussions held with the Americans.   They could perhaps be labeled differently,  he said, suggesting the description  martyr  could be dropped, but he added:  They are not going to be stopped.  The Palestinian Authority makes a variety of social security payments, mostly to families, for those convicted and imprisoned by Israel for fighting against the occupation and those killed in violence, whether they were carrying out suicide attacks, shot while throwing stones or in other circumstances.  Amounts vary depending on whether the person killed was married or had children. Those wounded also receive aid. In total, some 35,000 families receive support from a dedicated fund established in the 1960s, including those living outside the Palestinian territories. Some estimates suggest the fund distributes as much as $100 million a year.   At the same time, there are 6,500 Palestinians in Israeli jails, including 500 detained without charge, in some cases for years. All of them, including around 300 children and 50 women, receive monthly support from the Palestinian Authority.  For Abbas, ending such payments would be politically fraught. Surveys show he is highly unpopular and that would only likely worsen if support were stopped. It would probably strengthen his rival in the Islamist group Hamas. However, Abbas has taken some steps to stop payments in recent weeks, following meetings he held with President Donald Trump in Washington at the start of May and later the same month when the president visited the region.  Some 277 Palestinians released from Israeli jails under a prisoner-swap agreement and transported to the Gaza Strip, where Hamas is in charge, had their monthly stipends stopped, they told Reuters this month. Yet that decision seemed more about cutting funds that may help Hamas in Gaza rather than responding to U.S. or Israeli demands to end payments to those who have carried out attacks. Israeli officials said they had seen no evidence that the Palestinian Authority was stopping support.  Israel is unaware of any change in the policy of the Palestinians, who continue to make payments to the families of terrorists,  an official said, describing the payments a form of incitement to carry out violence.

Deutsche Post initially developed an electric minivan dubbed Streetscooter for its own operations to avoid inner-city emissions after growth in online shopping resulted in increased parcel deliveries. But in April it took on carmakers by unveiling plans to step up production and sell to other delivery firms. For the larger van, Ford will supply vehicle technology based on the Transit model, with Deutsche Post keeping assembly, distribution and sales in-house, a Germany-based Ford spokesman told Reuters. The new model is part of a plan to build another production site for the Streetscooter unit and double annual output to 20,000 vans by the end of the year.  This step emphasizes that Deutsche Post is an innovation leader. It will relieve the inner cities and increase people's quality of life,  Deutsche Post executive board member Juergen Gerdes said in a statement. Advances in manufacturing software are allowing auto industry newcomers such as Deutsche Post, Google and start-ups to tap suppliers to design, engineer and test new vehicle concepts without hiring thousands of engineering staff or investing billions in tooling and factories. Deutsche Post, which is also building a country-wide network of maintenance and repair shops, wants a fleet of at least 2,500 of the new vans on the road by the end of 2018, it said. The postal services group decided to build its own vans after it could not agree on a wider supply contract with established vehicle makers.    It is phasing out use of Volkswagen's (VOWG_p.DE) Caddy vans in favor of Streetscooters, and going it alone with the electric van project has upset VW.

It said the sport's drive for medals meant behavioural issues were not addressed.  The panel found that there were failings in British Cycling's governance and leadership, monitoring and supervision of the WCP (World Class Programme), training and development, and management and communications with staff and athletes,  it said. The panel recommended a root and branch review of governance, calling for leadership to change, staff to be better trained in equality and discrimination and that future funding should be conditional on implementation of its recommendations. The review was jointly commissioned by British Cycling and UK Sport last April after Jess Varnish made allegations of bullying and sexism against coach Shane Sutton after she was dropped. Other riders also made allegations against Sutton, which he denied. The Australian was suspended, but immediately quit. An internal inquiry by the British Cycling Board upheld an allegation that Sutton referred to female riders in insulting terms. British Cycling's chairman, Jonathan Browning, said he accepted the report's findings.  We accept, in full, the recommendations in the CIR (Cycling Independent Review) and apologise for where we have failed or fallen short of the standards which we should have achieved,  he said.  It is clear from the CIR that our structures and procedures, especially at the leadership level within the World Class Programme were lacking.  Since the findings were shared with us, we have rapidly made major changes to the WCP and to our leadership, operations and governance so that we can ensure that British Cycling learns these lessons and becomes a world class governing body.

Petronas has plans to offer September loadings of its Kimanis crude grade next month, the industry sources said.  DME documents - updated in June and posted on the exchange's website - indicate Petronas trading arm Petco is looking to sell the Kimanis grade over the Dubai platform, although without providing any details on volumes or timing.  Petronas and DME did not respond to queries on the matter.      The move comes amid rising Kimanis crude output, with the  August loadings of the grade expected to rise to a record 12 cargoes of 600,000 barrels each.      Rising Kimanis production and an overall global surplus has pressured primary sellers of the grade, including Petronas, Royal Dutch Shell, Murphy Oil, ConocoPhillips, Petroleum Brunei and Pertamina [PERTM.UL].      Kimanis premiums plunged to their lowest in nearly two years at around $1.50 a barrel to dated Brent in April, underscoring the difficulties sellers face in the current market.   Kimanis needs to find new homes ... It's good to find new buyers apart from the usual end-users,  a trading source who markets the grade said about Petronas' DME plans.      In a DME auction, potential buyers - who have to be pre-approved by the seller - will have two minutes to place bids after the company offering a cargo has set a minimum price.   The auction does not mean a better price, but you get to set a floor price. So if you get better than the floor price, it's a good thing,  said a source involved in the auction who is not approved to discuss the matter publicly.  Four cargoes of Middle East crude have been auctioned on the DME since January 2016. DME charges a 1.5 cent per barrel fee for cargoes sold via auction.  Kimanis is one of the largest Malaysian crude output streams. The Malaysian crude price mechanism introduced in 2014 was revised in January to add Kimanis to a benchmark formula based on the Labuan, Miri Light and Kikeh grades.

Within weeks, state-owned China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) is set to launch a small modular reactor (SMR) dubbed the   Nimble Dragon  with a pilot plant on the island province of Hainan, according to company officials. Unlike new large scale reactors that cost upward of $10 billion per unit and need large safety zones, SMRs create less toxic waste and can be built in a single factory. A little bigger than a bus and able to be transported by truck, SMRs could eventually cost less than a tenth the price of conventional reactors, developers predict.  The global nuclear industry will require around $80 billion in annual investment over the coming decade as countries strive to meet climate and clean energy goals, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) forecasts, and China is keen to get its hands on a substantial chunk of any new business.   Small-scale reactors are a new trend in the international development of nuclear power - they are safer and they can be used more flexibly,  said Chen Hua, vice-president of the China Nuclear New Energy Corporation, a subsidiary of CNNC.  Beijing is now racing the likes of Russia, Argentina and the United States to commercialize SMRs, which include passive cooling features to improve safety. Fukushima Fallout        Following the meltdown at Japan's Fukushima reactor complex in 2011, the beleaguered nuclear industry has been focused on rolling out safer, large-scale reactors in China and elsewhere.  But these so-called  third-generation  reactors have been mired in financing problems and building delays, deterring all but the most enthusiastically pro-nuclear nations.     The challenges of financing and building large, expensive reactors contributed to the bankruptcy of Toshiba Inc's (6502.T) nuclear unit, Westinghouse, and to the financial problems that forced France's Areva (AREVA.PA) to restructure. SMRs have capacity of less than 300 megawatts (MW) - enough to power around 200,000 homes - compared to at least 1 gigawatt (GW) for standard reactors.     China is aiming to lift domestic nuclear capacity to 200 GW by 2030, up from 35 GW at the end of March, but its ambitions are global. CNNC designed the Linglong, or  Nimble Dragon  to complement its larger Hualong or  China Dragon  reactor and has been in discussions with Pakistan, Iran, Britain, Indonesia, Mongolia, Brazil, Egypt and Canada as potential partners.  The big reactor is the Hualong One, the small reactor is the Linglong One - many countries intend to cooperate with CNNC's 'two dragons going out to sea',  Yu Peigen, vice-president of CNNC, told a briefing in May.  FILE PHOTO: A researcher works at an electromagnetic compatibility test laboratory of the Center of Excellence on Nuclear Security in the State Nuclear Security Technology Center in Beijing, China March 18, 2016.Kim Kyung-Hoon/File PhotoCrowded Field Others are also pursuing the technology, with around 50 different SMR designs worldwide according to the IAEA. Russia leads the way on floating plants suitable for its remote Arctic regions, and construction underway on the world's biggest icebreaker. U.S. firms including Westinghouse and Babcock & Wilcox (BW.N) have been developing their own SMRs, along with smaller start-ups like the Bill Gates-backed Terrapower. CNNC is now working on offshore floating nuclear plants it plans to use on islands in the South China Sea, as well as mini-reactors capable of replacing coal-fired heating systems in northern China. Company scientists are even looking at designs that could be installed on aircraft.    Elsewhere in China, Tsinghua University is building a version using a  pebblebed  of ceramic-coated fuel units that form the reactor core, improving efficiency. Shanghai scientists are also planning to build a pilot  molten salt  reactor, a potentially cheaper and safer technology where waste comes out in salt form. Visitors look at a model of Linglong One (ACP1000), a nuclear reactor developed by the China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC), at an expo in Beijing, China April 29, 2017. Picture taken April 29, 2017.StringerThe success of new small-scale reactors hinges on investors seeing new large-scale plants coming online and building on those successes, said Christopher Levesque, Terrapower's president.  We're not competing with those folks, we're rooting for them,  he told an industry forum in Shanghai last month.  China has had some overseas success already with its Hualong reactor, with Pakistan currently building a plant using the technology. The Hualong is also expected to gain regulatory approval in Britain after China helped finance the $24 billion Hinkley Point nuclear project there. Costs Key     Officials acknowledge nuclear still struggles to compete with cheaper coal- or gas-fired power. The OECD Nuclear Energy Agency estimates developers will need to build at least five SMRs at a time to keep costs down. Taking into account much lower safety, environmental and processing costs, however, the agency said SMRs could be competitive with new, large-scale reactors - particularly in remote regions where the alternative is a costly extension of power grids.   Given the delays and cost overruns associated with large-scale nuclear reactors around the world currently, the smaller size, reduced capital costs and shorter construction times associated with SMRs make them an attractive alternative,  said Georgina Hayden, head of power and renewables at BMI Research. Some developers believe basic SMR construction costs could eventually be cut to $2,000-$3,000 per kilowatt, making it competitive with large third-generation plants and new, low-emission, coal-fired power.   The cost of small reactors is a little higher than big reactors right now,  CNNEC's Chen told Reuters on the sidelines of an industry expo in Beijing.  But we believe that alongside the further development and bulk production of this technology, costs will decline further.

The Wall Street Journal, citing people familiar with the matter, reported late on Tuesday that talks between Hexagon and the potential buyers were at an early stage and that the company may ultimately decide not to pursue a sale. Industrial software and technology firms are in high demand as manufacturing processes become more automated and intelligent through the use of sensors to gather more digital data.  Recent deals include Siemens' (SIEGn.DE) $4.5 billion acquisition of U.S.-based Mentor Graphics, announced late last year, and ABB's (ABBN.S) purchase of industrial automation company Bernecker & Rainer.  Hexagon said in a statement on Wednesday it  regularly evaluates various opportunities to optimize the companyâs positioning and shareholder value .   Should these evaluations lead to concrete results, the market will be immediately informed,  it said. Shares in Hexagon rose more than 17 percent in early trade and were still up 11.3 percent at 420.40 crowns by 1008 GMT, valuing the company at about 150 billion crowns ($17.3 billion) and putting it just outside the 10 largest Swedish listed firms and well ahead of companies such as home appliances maker Electrolux (ELUXb.ST).   Swedbank analyst Mathias Lundberg said a deal was possible but expressed doubts about the reported price tag.   If you look at the price tag it's too low to let Hexagon go. And the company has a long way left on its own journey. They are merely at the beginning of the whole digitalization part,  he said. Swedbank has a neutral rating on the stock.  Investment firm Melker Schorling AB (MELK.ST), Hexagon's biggest shareholder with a 26 percent stake and 46.9 percent of voting rights as of the end of May, declined to comment. Its shares were up 6 percent. The second biggest owner in Hexagon is fashion retailer H&M; Hennes & Mauritz's (HMb.ST) chairman Stefan Persson's Ramsbury Invest, with a 4.8 percent stake. Turmoil Over the past year Chief Executive Ola Rollen has faced allegations of insider trading while long-time chairman Melker Schorling recently stepped down due to poor health. Rollen's trial in Norway on charges of insider trading, which relates to an investment that did not involve Hexagon, is expected to start in late October. Rollen denies wrongdoing.  As CEO, Rollen has helped transform a sprawling conglomerate with a market value of a few billion crowns in 2000 into a measurement technology market leader following a steady stream of acquisitions and high growth. In February it bought U.S.-based MSC Software in a $834 million deal to boost its portfolio in automated manufacturing. Hexagon counts Trimble Navigation (TRMB.O), Autodesk (ADSK.O) and Dassault Systemes (DAST.PA) among its competitors. Its sensors and software are used for measurement and quality inspection in manufacturing processes and in engineering plant design and operations. Its products are also used in areas such as infrastructure planning, construction, mining, agriculture and energy.  I think it is not unlikely there will be some kind of structural change in Hexagon over time,  Handelsbanken Capital Markets analyst Daniel Djurberg said, pointing to Hexagon's industrial-focused business as the main attraction for prospective buyers.  But I think it would be a complex process for potential buyers to buy all of Hexagon with a big premium if they only are interested in half of the company.        Hexagon, which has around 18,000 staff, had sales of 3.1 billion euros in 2016 and is aiming for sales of 4.6-5.1 billion euros by 2021.

After days of political turmoil sparked by her botched gamble on a snap election, May's Conservative Party resumed talks with a small Northern Irish Protestant party on securing the support of its 10 members of parliament to pass legislation. May said late on Wednesday that the talks were continuing, but that a fire that devastated a 24-storey tower block in London, killing at least 12 people, had taken priority.  Arlene Foster, the leader of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), met May for talks in Downing Street on Tuesday but Sky News reported she had returned to Belfast on Wednesday evening, leaving party colleagues to continue the negotiations.  We are continuing to have talks but today, as you will imagine, there has been a real focus on this terrible tragedy in London,  May said. Even with a deal nearing to secure her government's survival, May is so weakened that her Brexit strategy has become the subject of public debate inside her own party, with two former prime ministers urging her to soften her approach. May has said the divorce talks, likely to be the most complex in Europe since World War Two, will begin as planned next week and her Brexit minister, David Davis, said Britain's negotiating position was unchanged.   There is a unity of purpose among people in the United Kingdom,  May said following a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris.   It's a unity of purpose, having voted to leave the EU, that their government gets on with that and makes a success of it.  But with so much at stake for Britain and its $2.5 trillion economy, pressure was mounting on May from within and without her party to heed other voices. Related CoverageUK PM May says DUP talks continue but London fire a real focusBritish Lib Dem leader quits, says can't lead party and be a ChristianDUP leader returns to Northern Ireland, talks continue: Sky NewsMay now faces the task of satisfying both the pro-European and eurosceptic factions of her party, keeping Northern Ireland calm and negotiating a divorce with 27 other EU members whose combined economic might is more than five times that of Britain. Alice in Wonderland?  Before the election, May proposed a clean break from the EU, involving withdrawal from the EU single market, limits on immigration and a bespoke customs deal with the EU. The Times newspaper said finance minister Philip Hammond would push May not to leave the customs union - an arrangement that guarantees tariff-free trade within the bloc but prohibits members from striking trade deals with third parties. But a newly appointed junior Brexit minister, Steve Baker, told Reuters:  I don't foresee any change ... The reality is that where we stand follows logically from leaving, so, if we're leaving, what we need to do is do it smoothly and successfully and gain economic benefit.  France's Macron said the door was still open for Britain to remain in the EU, though he added that it would be difficult to walk back once negotiations start. The European Parliament's Brexit coordinator, Guy Verhofstadt, struck a harsher tone: Britain, he said, could change its mind, but it would be poorer.  Like Alice in Wonderland, not all the doors are the same. It will be a brand new door, with a new Europe, a Europe without rebates, without complexity, with real powers and with unity,  Verhofstadt said. May has not yet responded to a proposal from some Conservatives for business groups and lawmakers from all parties to agree a national position on Brexit.   We would restore faith in politics if we could show that this parliament can at least function in presenting a view in the national interest which would command a majority on a cross-party basis,  said veteran pro-European Conservative lawmaker Ken Clarke. Former prime minister David Cameron said May needed to listen to opposition parties, and that there would be pressure for a softer Brexit that would give greater priority to a close trading deal with the EU. Yet many of her lawmakers and party members favor a sharp break with the EU - a sign of the divisions over Europe that helped sink the premierships of May's predecessors Margaret Thatcher, John Major and Cameron.  The performance of the British economy could also influence perceptions: Data on Wednesday showed average weekly pay in the three months to April was down 0.4 percent, year-on-year, in inflation-adjusted terms - the biggest fall since the three months to September 2014.  Dup Talks May has given no indication that she will change her plan for Brexit, though she has said she will try to achieve broader agreement across her party. Whatever her ultimate plan, she will be heavily reliant upon the 10 lawmakers from the eurosceptic DUP, who would help her edge past the 326 votes needed in parliament to avoid the government collapsing. However, putting the pro-British unionist DUP in a position of influence in London could also undermine the British government's ability, enshrined in a 1998 peace agreement, to function as an impartial broker between Northern Ireland's unionists and its Catholic Irish nationalists. Major, who helped to bring about that peace, said he was concerned that May's arrangement with the DUP could pitch the province back into turmoil by persuading 'hard men' on both sides of the divide to return to violence. The Irish nationalist party Sinn Fein, which wants the British province to join a united Ireland, said the prospect was causing anxiety and fear in Northern Ireland.  While the DUP are deeply eurosceptic, they have balked at some of the practical implications of a so-called hard Brexit -- including the potential loss of an open border with the Republic of Ireland -- and the talks were likely to touch on efforts to minimize the potential damage to Northern Ireland.

The 47 patients in the study were suffering from HIV-associated facial lipoatrophy, an abnormal loss of fat from the face that gives people a gaunt, sunken-face appearance. It can be caused by the raft of antiviral medicines used by HIV patients to keep the virus in check. Renevia is a hydrogel polymer that is mixed with precursor cells derived from fat elsewhere in the body, providing the cellular structure that allows them to graft and survive in a new location in the face. Treated patients had about 5 cc of Renevia injected into each side of the face and were measured for facial volume after six months. At six months, those who received Renevia on average had 5.1 cc of the new hemifacial volume, representing 100 percent retention of the transplanted material, compared with no new facial volume in untreated patients. The results were deemed to be statistically significant.  The retention of the transfer volume after six months in patients is quite impressive and we look forward to evaluating the 12-month data,  Dr Ramon Llull, the study's primary investigator, said in a statement. There were no serious side effects associated with Renevia treatment reported in the trial, BioTime said. About 350,000 HIV patients in Europe suffer from significant facial lipoatrophy, the company said. With this data in hand, BioTime plans to discuss requirements for U.S. trials with the Food and Drug Administration. Once the company secures approvals for the HIV-related condition, it plans to go after the far larger and lucrative facial aesthetics market, Co-Chief Executive Adi Mohanty said. In that market, it would be aimed at and used by plastic surgeons, a cash business that does not rely on reimbursements from insurers, much like Allergan Plc's hugely successful Botox.  Dermal fillers and other widely used fat transplant methods tend to lose volume far more quickly that what has been demonstrated by Renevia, Mohanty explained. And if Renevia works using cells compromised by the effects of HIV medications, the company believes even better results are possible with healthy subjects.   If those cells are still attaching and grafting and surviving, then healthier cells should have no trouble,  Mohanty said.

As credit conditions tighten in the world's second-largest economy, borrowing costs for companies are rising. Banks are raising lending rates, including mortgage rates, and are wary of taking on more exposure to overheated sectors such as property. That trend will set the stage for a gradual slowdown in economic activity in coming months, analysts believe, though no one foresees a sharp decline as stability is the watchword ahead of a major political leadership reshuffle later this year. China's banks extended 1.11 trillion yuan ($163.4 billion) in net new yuan loans in May, central bank data showed on Wednesday, slightly up from 1.1 trillion yuan in April, and above the 900 billion yuan forecast in a Reuters poll. The People's Bank of China (PBOC) has kept cash conditions relatively tight in recent months to support the government's de-leveraging efforts, but authorities have been careful not to squeeze conditions too much for fear that a spike in rates could hurt the economy. The PBOC has drained 775 billion yuan from money markets via open market operations so far this year as its keeps a tight grip on short-term lending, while regulators have issued a slew of directives aimed at deterring riskier forms of borrowing. But the central bank has also injected funds from time to time in various ways to soothe fears about a cash crunch, like that which some analysts believe it inadvertently triggered in 2013 in a similar clampdown on risk. Still, in recent weeks lenders have been scrambling to raise cash ahead of quarterly health checks by the central bank, pushing up deposit rates and yields of wealth management products, media have reported. The one-year Shanghai Interbank Offering Rate (SHIBOR) jumped to a two-year high of 4.4231 percent on Wednesday, above the PBOC's benchmark lending rate of 4.35 percent. Higher funding costs will add to upward pressure on lending rates. Industrial firms' financial costs rose 4.2 percent in April from a year earlier, according to the statistics bureau. The effects of the multi-pronged crackdown are starting to show up in weakened off-balance sheet financing, or shadow banking activity. Total social financing (TSF), a broad measure of credit and liquidity in the economy, fell to 1.06 trillion yuan in May from 1.39 trillion yuan in April, the data showed. Combined trust loans, entrusted loans and undiscounted banker's acceptances, which are common forms of shadow banking activity, fell sharply to 28.9 billion yuan in May from 177 billion yuan in April, according to Reuters calculations. But household loans, mostly mortgages, rose to 610.6 billion yuan in May from 571 billion yuan in April, the data showed. Household loans accounted for 55 percent of total new loans last month, up from 52 percent in April. Chinese leaders have pledged to shift the emphasis to addressing financial risks and debt and asset bubbles which analysts say may spark a crisis in the economy if not handled well. China's banks extended a record 12.65 trillion yuan in loans in 2016 as the government encouraged credit-fueled stimulus to meet its economic growth target. Broad M2 money supply (M2) grew 9.6 percent from a year earlier, missing forecasts for an expansion of 10.4 percent and compared with April's 10.5 percent. The M2 growth was the lowest since at least January 1996, when Reuters data on the series began. The central bank said slower M2 growth could be a  new normal .

Guterres' first visit as secretary general comes as the Afghan government faces internal turmoil, insurgents make gains nationwide and the international military coalition mulls plans to send thousands more troops to help struggling Afghan forces. These combined threats have worsened the crisis for refugees and internally displaced people, forcing international bodies like the United Nations to call for emergency funding. The crisis can only be solved by ending the war, said Guterres, standing in a makeshift camp on the outskirts of Kabul that accommodates Afghans displaced by fighting.   Peace is the solution for the problem,  said Guterres, previously a United Nations' high commissioner for refugees. At least 126,000 Afghans have been forced to flee their homes, the United Nations says.  More than 218,000 Afghan refugees have also returned this year from neighboring Iran and Pakistan, many citing pressure from authorities there. The International Organization for Migration estimates that at least 600,000 refugees could return this year, piling strain on aid groups struggling to help the newly displaced. Khumri, a 30-year-old Afghan woman who met Guterres, said she had lived in the squalid camp for the last two years with her family after their home was destroyed and her husband killed by government forces battling Taliban occupying their village in the northeastern province of Kapisa.  We need everything,  she said, recounting the struggle for clean water, food, and hygiene materials that drives some to beg. Guterres was set to meet Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, who is trying to soothe domestic political tension after recent violence in the capital, Kabul. Ghani also hosted international delegations last week in a bid to set the stage for peace negotiations with the Taliban, which have remained stalled amid widespread fighting. If the Taliban do not begin negotiations soon, Ghani will seek new U.N. sanctions against the group as a sponsor of terrorism, he told the June 6 meeting. Any sanctions would be up to the U.N. Security Council, Guterres said. Afghanistan has endured too many  foreign interventions , however, he added, urging an eventual deal to resolve the war. Thousands of international troops remain in Afghanistan to train and assist Afghan forces, besides mounting counterterrorism operations. U.S. President Donald Trump has given Defense Secretary Jim Mattis the authority to set troop levels in Afghanistan, opening the door for future troop increases.

The contenders are Mexican chemical firm Mexichem (MEXCHEM.MX); U.S. industrial technologies company Fortive Corp (FTV.N), Singapore's Temasek Holdings [TEM.UL], U.S. tools maker Stanley Black & Decker (SWK.N), Chinese investment fund Primavera and Chinese pipe maker Ningxia Qinglong (002457.SZ). The sale has set a minimum value of $1.5 billion for the company. Netafim said in March it had hired Goldman Sachs (GS.N) to handle a possible sale or public offering of the company. Centerview and Bank of America (BAC.N) were also appointed to advise on the deal. The company is hoping for a valuation of between 10 and 12 times its expected 2017 earning before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of around $120 million, a banking source told Reuters in May. Any offer reflecting a value of more than $1.8 billion allows Permira to force the remaining shareholders to sell their holdings in Netafim, Calcalist said. Kibbutz Hatzerim owns 32.7 percent of Netafim and Kibbutz Magal owns 6 percent. A spokesman for Netafim declined to comment. The date of the third round has yet to be set.

Last week, thousands of cabs blocked streets of Poland's biggest cities demanding that the government react to  illegal activity  by some drivers, widely seen as a protest against Uber. Some Uber drivers have been targeted by vandals who poured excrement or acid on their cars.  We want a compromise between the taxi industry and the sharing industry,  Morawiecki told a news conference.  We need some requirements ... but on the other hand is it necessary to know every single street's location since everyone has GPS in his smartphone?  he said, referring to the exams would-be taxi drivers must pass to obtain a licence. Uber, which grew to a valuation of $68 billion in seven years, has changed the tightly regulated taxi industry in many countries, but has run into legal trouble with the way it handles employees and drivers. Uber CEO Travis Kalanick told employees on Tuesday he will take time away from the company he helped to found, one of a series of measures the company is taking to claw its way out from under a mountain of controversies. Without naming Uber specifically, Morawiecki said he wanted international corporations operating in Poland to pay taxes in Poland.

The 47 patients in the study were suffering from HIV-associated facial lipoatrophy, an abnormal loss of fat from the face that gives people a gaunt, sunken-face appearance. It can be caused by the raft of antiviral medicines used by HIV patients to keep the virus in check. Renevia is a hydrogel polymer that is mixed with precursor cells derived from fat elsewhere in the body, providing the cellular structure that allows them to graft and survive in a new location in the face. Treated patients had about 5 cc of Renevia injected into each side of the face and were measured for facial volume after six months. At six months, those who received Renevia on average had 5.1 cc of the new hemifacial volume, representing 100 percent retention of the transplanted material, compared with no new facial volume in untreated patients. The results were deemed to be statistically significant.  The retention of the transfer volume after six months in patients is quite impressive and we look forward to evaluating the 12-month data,  Dr Ramon Llull, the study's primary investigator, said in a statement. There were no serious side effects associated with Renevia treatment reported in the trial, BioTime said. About 350,000 HIV patients in Europe suffer from significant facial lipoatrophy, the company said. With this data in hand, BioTime plans to discuss requirements for U.S. trials with the Food and Drug Administration. Once the company secures approvals for the HIV-related condition, it plans to go after the far larger and lucrative facial aesthetics market, Co-Chief Executive Adi Mohanty said. In that market, it would be aimed at and used by plastic surgeons, a cash business that does not rely on reimbursements from insurers, much like Allergan Plc's hugely successful Botox.  Dermal fillers and other widely used fat transplant methods tend to lose volume far more quickly that what has been demonstrated by Renevia, Mohanty explained. And if Renevia works using cells compromised by the effects of HIV medications, the company believes even better results are possible with healthy subjects.   If those cells are still attaching and grafting and surviving, then healthier cells should have no trouble,  Mohanty said.

The Rand Merchant Bank (RMB) business confidence index compiled by the Bureau for Economic Research fell to 29 points in the second quarter from 40 points in the first quarter, remaining firmly below the 50-mark separating the net positive and negative territories. South Africa sank into recession for the first time in eight years in the first quarter, hit by weakness in consumer sectors such as wholesale, retail and accommodation. The latest survey results suggest seven out of every 10 respondents are downbeat about prevailing business conditions, suggesting year-on-year economic growth slowed even further in the second quarter, RMB said.  In fact, given the severe strain many industry respondents (and consumers for that matter) are under, a contraction in GDP for the year as a whole is not inconceivable,  RMB said in a statement. Unlike the 2009 recession, when authorities eased fiscal policy and aggressively cut rates to counter the decline in economic growth, RMB sees  no easy options  this time to restart economic growth.  Given sovereign credit rating pressures, providing fiscal stimulus is not an option. And while it is not impossible for the Reserve Bank to lower rates, a deep-cutting cycle is most unlikely given the rand's vulnerability to various global as well as domestic risks,  RMB added. Ratings agency Moody's downgraded South Africa's credit rating but kept it at investment grade with a negative outlook, citing a recent abrupt cabinet reshuffle and reduced growth prospects for an economy mired in recession. South Africa relies heavily on foreign money to cover its large budget and current account deficits but could struggle to attract investment if political tensions linger on and economic growth does not return.

They bought and sold her five times before she was finally freed with her children last week.  Khalaf is one of many Yazidi women that Kurdish fighters in northern Syria have set out to free from Islamic State in covert operations, a female Kurdish militia commander told Reuters. They have dubbed the operation  revenge for the women of Sinjar , the homeland of Iraq's ancient Yazidi minority which Islamic State overran in the summer of 2014.  The militants slaughtered, enslaved and raped thousands of people when they rampaged through northern Iraq, purging its Yazidi community. They abducted Yazidi women as sex slaves and gunned down male relatives, witnesses and Iraqi officials say. Nearly 3,000 women are believed to be still in captivity.  Nisreen Abdallah, a commander in the YPJ militia, said around 200 women and children from northern Iraq have been freed in various parts of Syria so far. The Kurdish YPG militia and its all-female YPJ brigade rescued them in what she described as covert operations into IS territory that began last year. Abdallah declined to divulge more details for security reasons. The Syrian militias launched this mission as part of their U.S.-backed offensive on Raqqa, Islamic State's base of operations in Syria, she said. With the YPG at its forefront, an alliance of Kurdish and Arab militias began pushing into Raqqa last week, after advancing on the city since November.  Since then, we have been working to liberate the Yazidi women held captive by Daesh,  Abdallah said. In the case of Khalaf, she said Kurdish fighters made contact with her and drew up  an appropriate plan  to free her unharmed.  Code Word Noura Khalaf said she had been living with her children as the slave of an Islamic State militant in Syria's Hama province for a year, when an unidentified man smuggled them out in the YPG-coordinated operation. The plan took shape thanks to IS rules forbidding fighters from taking mobile phones to the frontlines, she said. The jihadist holding Khalaf left his at home, allowing her to call her brother who in turn asked the YPG for help. Noura Khodr Khalaf, 24, a Yazidi woman who was recently freed from Islamic State, stands with her children in a centre belonging to the Kurdish-led administration in Qamishli, Syria June 10, 2017. Picture taken June 10, 2017.Rodi Said Abu Amir used to leave his phone at home when he went to the frontline,  said 24-year-old Khalaf.  I had memorized my brother's number.       Khalaf was eventually told to await contact from a man who would come to rescue her. He uttered a pre-agreed code word, so she would know it was safe to leave with him.  I'm happy to be staying here,  she said, speaking to Reuters in the Syrian city of Qamishli in the Kurdish-controlled northeast. She will soon return to the Sinjar mountain region.  After I rest here, I will go meet my brother,  she said. After Islamic State kidnapped Khalaf with her four children  in 2014, they bussed her around northern Iraq, including Mosul, along with dozens of women from her hometown of Kojo in Sinjar.  I still don't know what happened to my husband,  she said. Noura Khodr Khalaf, 24, a Yazidi woman who was recently freed from Islamic State, poses in a centre belonging to the Kurdish-led administration in Qamishli, Syria June 10, 2017. Picture taken June 10, 2017.Rodi SaidAt one point in her captivity, militants kept her in an underground jail in Raqqa, she said, and at another, they held her in a prison in Palmyra.  They took us to an underground market for selling women, where they displayed us for Islamic State members and each one picks the girl he likes,  she said. Fighters forced her to serve and cook for them, some beating and raping her repeatedly. Now, Khalaf and her children are staying at a shelter run by the women's council of the Kurdish-led administration in northeast Syria. Abdallah, the YPJ commander, said they deliver the women to their relatives in northern Iraq by coordinating with a Yazidi committee around Sinjar.  Two months earlier, Kurdish fighters also rescued Khalaf's seven-year-old daughter, who had been sold off near Raqqa, and sent her to relatives in Sinjar, she said.   We will also send Noura, through the women's council. So she will see her daughter again,  Abdallah said.   Those who are freed have been away from their relatives, living among Daesh for years...in alienation and degradation,  Abdallah said.  They have psychological complexes and they need care.  The beliefs of the Yazidi community, which Islamic State regards as devil-worship, combine elements of several ancient Middle Eastern religions.

In April, the IMF hiked its forecast for this year to 6.6 percent from January's 6.5 percent, which was 0.3 percentage points above the previous projection.  China's economy grew a faster-than-expected 6.9 percent in 2017's first quarter, well above the government's target of around 6.5 percent for the full year.  The IMF said it now expects China's growth to average 6.4 percent annually during 2018-2020. In April, the fund said it expected 2018 growth to be 6.2 percent.  Along with a higher growth forecast, the IMF on Wednesday recommended China speed up reforms to transition its economy to more sustainable growth and adopt less accommodative monetary policy.   The critically important recent focus on tackling financial sector risks should continue, even if it entails some financial tensions and slower growth,  IMF deputy managing director David Lipton told reporters in Beijing.  China needs to ensure that  where credit is granted, it is backing economic activity that will be useful, that will be supportive of growth and will permit debts to be serviced without difficultly,  he said. Beijing should also resume progress towards a flexible exchange rate, Lipton said, while adding that the IMF assesses the yuan currency CNY= to be  broadly in line with fundamentals . The strengthening U.S. economy, albeit with normalizing interest rates, is likely to be useful for the rest of the world, Lipton said. The IMF official said President Xi Jinping's speech at Davos in January was the start of China playing  a kind of leadership role at a time when there is a dialogue going on around the world about the path of globalization.

The Spanish company, which also owns younger fashion chain Pull&Bear; and upmarket label Massimo Dutti, said net profit totaled 654 million euros ($733 million) for its first quarter that ended on April 30, in line with analysts' forecasts. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) were 1.1 billion euros, up 17 percent year-on-year and above estimates. Inditex has consistently outperformed H&M; and other rivals in the past few years as a result of its online growth and fast-fashion model that allows it to whistle the latest trends from the runway into stores within days. Its shares have rallied 13 percent in the past three months as analysts expect the retailer to benefit from a more positive currency environment this year.  However, its shares slipped 1.4 percent to 35.35 euros on Wednesday, lagging Spain's blue chip index Ibex .IBEX, after Inditex said its local currency sales rose by 12 percent from Feb. 1 to June 3, slowing from 14 percent growth between Feb. 1 and April 30.

Authorities in Moscow intend to resettle over 1 million citizens from decrepit Soviet-era apartment blocks, which they plan to raze, into modern high-rise flats. But concerns about how people will be rehoused are upsetting voters ahead of a presidential election in 2018. On Wednesday, dozens of Muscovites protested against the plan outside the State Duma, the lower house of parliament, as lawmakers inside voted to approve the legislation in its third and final reading by 399 votes to two, with one abstention. Protesters brandished copies of the Russian constitution, reflecting their concerns that their right to own and enjoy private property is under threat. Lawmakers have made several amendments to the legislation which they say address such fears and are aimed at better protecting people's rights. Reuters witnesses saw policemen drag several people away, including Sergei Mitrokhin, the leader of the opposition Yabloko party. The OVD-Info monitoring group, a non-profit organisation, said 15 people had been detained. The authorities deem protests held without obtaining their advance approval of the venue and timing illegal. They often refuse such requests, citing everything from public safety to unacceptable disruption. Thousands of Moscow residents protested against the same resettlement plan in the city centre in May. The upper house of parliament, the Federation Council, will now vote on the legislation once before passing it to President Vladimir Putin for his approval, something he is expected to give.

The pan-European STOXX 600 benchmark and its euro zone counterpart rose 0.6 to 0.7 percent, in line with blue-chips, with broad investor focus on the U.S. Fed rate decision later in the day in which the bank is widely expected to raise rates. They climbed to a session high after Euro zone industrial output data showed healthy economic growth, and employment hit a record high. In Britain the FTSE 100 rose 0.5 percent while midcaps rose 0.8 percent. Hexagon stole the limelight, jumping more than 16 percent to a new record high after a Wall Street Journal report that the Swedish measurement technology firm was in talks for a potential sale to undisclosed buyers. Hexagon said in a statement that the market would be immediately informed should evaluations lead to concrete results. Technology stocks were the best-performing for the second session running, up 1.3 percent and clawing back after a nosedive fueled by jitters over valuations, particularly in the U.S. Chipmakers Infineon, Dialog Semiconductor and ASML all gained 1.2 to 1.5 percent. Tech sector aside, the trend of outperformance of defensives relative to cyclical sectors continued, with utilities among the best-performing sectors while banks made timid gains and autos were in the red.  We expect the dominant market narrative over the coming months to be the fade in Euro area PMI momentum,  said Deutsche Bank European equity strategist Sebastien Raedler.  We remain underweight European cyclicals versus defensives, which have underperformed by 4 percent since early May, as Euro area macro surprises have started to roll over.  British housebuilder Bellway gained ground after its trading update showed robust demand for homes did not slow ahead of the national election on June 8. The builder's upbeat tone also lifted peers Barratt Development and Taylor Wimpey. Meanwhile, a changing of the guard at French utility EDF boosted it by 4.3 percent. EDF appointed an Italian to run its British unit handling the construction of two nuclear reactors at Hinkley Point C. Elsewhere, broker updates propelled share prices. Austria's Raiffeisen Bank sank to the bottom of the European index after Barclays cut the stock to an  underweight , saying it is relatively expensive and less geared to rising rates than its peer Erste bank.  We believe that Raiffeisen's stock has run too far on its restructuring and earnings recovery, and that its higher risk business profile makes its earnings outlook volatile,  said Barclays analyst Victor Galliano.

The meeting, headed by Glencore's Australian Chief Executive Peter Freyberg, comes five days after Glencore outbid Chinese-owned Yancoal for Coal & Allied Industries Ltd, which operates thermal coal mines in Australia's Hunter Valley.  Glencore's proposal is $100 million higher and fully funded, but Rio Tinto has to give Yancoal the chance to make a counter offer, opening the way for a bidding war. A formal response from Rio Tinto to Glencore's offer could come by the end of the week, the sources said, given Glencore's acceptance deadline of June 26. If Glencore's offer is accepted by Rio Tinto, Yancoal will have five days to respond. Yancoal and Glencore declined to comment. Rio Tinto could not be reached for immediate comment. Freyberg will argue before the Rio Tinto directors, who are meeting this week in Canada, that Glencore's offer provides greater financial certainty than Yancoal's because it intends to fund the acquisition from cash on hand and committed facilities, subject only to regulatory conditions.   Glencore thinks it has the better offer because it's higher and there are may be doubts over Yancoal's funding,  one of the sources said. Yancoal's second-biggest shareholder is struggling commodities trader Noble Group. Yancoal plans a capital raising to help pay forÂ Coal & Allied and Noble would have to invest $260 million in newly issued Yancoal stock to maintain its stake at 13 percent.  This is an element that Glencore will be stressing,  the source said. Fitch Ratings cut Noble's rating on May 26 on concern over its ability to address about $2 billion of debt maturing over the next 12 months. Yancoal said last month it was not concerned at that time over Noble's financial strength. Freyberg is also expected to try and assure Rio Tinto that its bid would not run into hurdles from competition regulators in China and Australia. The bulk of the coal is sold to power companies in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, with little remaining in Australia or sold to China.

The European Union's statistics office Eurostat said industrial production in the 19-country single currency bloc rose by 0.5 percent from March, in line with market expectations. Year-on-year output in April output went up 1.4 percent, slightly higher than market forecasts of a 1.3 percent rise. The solid increase of industrial output was compounded by upwardly revised figures for March when production rose 0.2 percent on the month, and 2.2 percent on the year. Eurostat had previously estimated a 0.1 percent drop on the month in March and a 1.9 percent rise on the year. In a separate release, Eurostat said employment in the euro zone in the first quarter grew by 0.4 percent on the quarter and by 1.5 percent on the year. In absolute terms, 154.8 million people were employed in the euro zone in the first quarter, the highest number ever recorded and surpassing the previous peak in the first quarter of 2008, Eurostat said. Eurostat also revised up employment its figures for the last quarter of 2016, when the rate of employed people rose 0.4 percent on the quarter and 1.4 percent on the year. It had previously estimated increases of 0.3 percent on the quarter and 1.1 percent on the year.  The positive figures bode well for the bloc's growth in the second quarter, after overall 0.6 percent expansion in the first three months of the year. The April increase in industrial output was mostly due to a sharp 4.7 percent rise on the month in energy production. Output went also up by 0.6 percent for durable consumer goods, such as fridges or cars, in a sign that consumers were ready to spend on more expensive items. Production also increased for non-durable consumer goods, such as food and clothing, by 0.2 percent on the month, and for intermediate goods by 0.1 percent. The only indicator that in April recorded a drop was for capital goods for which output went down by 0.7 percent on the month, after a 0.9 percent rise in March.

But its headline-grabbing deals and the connections forged by chairman Wu Xiaohui - from Beijing to President Donald Trump's son-in-law - have invited closer scrutiny. On Wednesday, the privately held company said Wu had temporarily stepped aside, following unverified reports of his detention in China. It has not provided further details. Wu, who married the grand-daughter of late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, has been the driving force at Anbang since founding the company in 2004. The group worked in obscurity before turning to more aggressive financing to catapult it over rivals who rake in much larger volumes of premiums.  Over the past three years, Anbang has secured acquisitions worth more than $30 billion - a diverse list that has raised regulatory questions at home and abroad. As queries grew, the low-profile Wu made more public appearances this year at key events including the annual Boao Forum, China's answer to the Davos World Economic Forum.   On one panel there he playfully sparred with Levin Zhu, the politically powerful former CEO of China International Capital Corp and a former Anbang director, who repeatedly questioned him on the company's finances, attendees reported.  Anbang's rise to international prominence has been much like that of modern China itself - meteoric, with mystical origins, and often misunderstood,  said Brock Silvers, managing director of Kaiyuan Capital, a Shanghai-based investment advisory firm.   The company was continuously dogged by rumors regarding its capital origins, yet continued to succeed,  he added. Hard-Driving, Hands-on Known for his hard-driving, hands-on approach and single-minded ambition, Wu is not the first high-profile executive reported to be targeted or questioned by Chinese authorities. China-born billionaire Xiao Jianhua was taken from a luxury Hong Kong hotel in a wheelchair in January, a source told Reuters. Local media reported the group that took him away were mainland Chinese agents, which Chinese authorities have not commented on.  Fosun chairman Guo Guangchang reportedly lost contact with the healthcare-to-insurance conglomerate in 2015 before re-emerging to say he was assisting authorities in a probe. Wu says he works at least 12 hours a day, and those working with him say calls from Wu at all hours of the day or night are not uncommon. Occasionally, he sleeps in his office. FILE PHOTO: Chairman of Anbang Insurance Group Wu Xiaohui attends the China Development Forum in Beijing, China March 18, 2017.Thomas Peter/File Photo We must win the first battle and every battle thereafter as we are representing Chinese enterprises going global,  Wu, now 51, told students at Harvard University in 2015.  We must have conviction that we can make profit even under the worst case scenario in order to move forward on each investment.  Deal or No Deal Many of Anbang's latest deals, though, have faltered. The Beijing-based firm in 2016 offered $14 billion for U.S. hotel operator Starwood but pulled out from what would have been the largest Chinese takeover of a U.S. company. A year later, it held talks with Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law, to develop a New York office tower. That deal foundered amid controversy over the extended family of the U.S. president selling to a politically connected Chinese tycoon. Anbang's $1.6 billion offer for U.S. annuities and life insurer Fidelity & Guaranty Life fell through in April. Anbang had separately sought to list its life insurance business in Hong Kong and invited banks last August to pitch for the deal, sources familiar with the matter said at the time. That too went quiet. Wu's strategy echoed that of famed U.S. investor Warren Buffett - an aggressive pursuit of yield-producing companies, funded by cash from selling insurance products and other sources.  In addition to his international deals, Wu also bought significant stakes in a number of Chinese banks and financial companies. He also aligned with powerful allies. When he set up Anbang, Wu enlisted a small consortium of private and state investors, led by Shanghai Automotive Industry Group Corp (SAIC), the parent of a government-owned automaker. State-owned China Petrochemical Corp later bought a stake. In addition to Levin Zhu, Anbang's original board included Long Yongtu, China's chief negotiator when it joined the World Trade Organization. Wu also turned to Chen Xiaolu, a son of Chinese Marshal Chen Yi, for support. One source who has advised Anbang said Wu worked hard to cultivate connections with politically connected figures and princelings, the children of the country's political elite, including the Deng family.   Even if you marry a princeling, that doesn't necessarily mean you are a full member of the family,  the source said.

Britain's blue chip FTSE 100 index climbed 0.4 percent to 7,528.33 points by 0912 GMT, while the mid caps gained 0.8 percent. While housebuilders were hit by a selloff in the immediate aftermath of the UK's general election, which resulted in a hung parliament, a trading update from Bellway eased investors' concerns as the firm said that demand did not slow in the run-up to the election.  Housebuilders generally ... have been marked down because of fears over the UK economy, the UK property market, but actually the numbers that are coming out of these companies are still pretty reassuring,  said Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.  There are a number of tailwinds that (the housebuilders) also have, one of which is extremely low interest rates, another of which is the chronic lack of housing in this country, and a third thing is the government help to buy scheme,  Khalaf added. Bellway's shares rose 4.5 percent to a 1-month high, while blue chip peers Barratt Developments, Persimmon and Taylor Wimpey were among the top FTSE gainers, up between 1.9 percent to 2.3 percent. British large caps extended gains after sterling weakened following UK data which showed that earnings after inflation contracted at the fastest pace since 2014, highlighting the growing post-Brexit strain on households. Budget airline easyJet also enjoyed gains, its shares advancing 1.2 percent following a supportive note from Davy Research which upgraded the stock to  neutral  from  underperform , citing its higher operating leverage in the current environment.  We believe that the European low-cost carriers will continue to see improving pricing trends as we approach peak summer, albeit a consensus among the airlines has yet to form on whether pricing will be positive or negative,  analysts at Davy said in a note. Only a dozen or so more cyclical stocks such as banks Lloyds and Standard Chartered and energy stock were in negative territory on the FTSE, while equipment hire firm Ashtead dropped 2.8 percent, extending losses from the previous session after its earnings update.  Strong FY17 results, but no consensus upgrades, saw a muted investor reaction and we see more downside from here,  analysts at UBS said, adding that accelerating competition and slowing end markets this summer could leave Ashtead's valuation exposed. Likewise shares in engineering group GKN also came under pressure after Panmure cut its rating to  sell  from  hold , on the back of challenges in the U.S. auto and Middle East aircraft markets.

In April, the IMF hiked its forecast for this year to 6.6 percent from January's 6.5 percent, which was 0.3 percentage points above the previous projection. China's economy grew a faster-than-expected 6.9 percent in 2017's first quarter, well above the government's target of around 6.5 percent for the full year. The IMF said it now expects China's growth to average 6.4 percent annually during 2018-2020. In April, the fund said it expected 2018 growth to be 6.2 percent. Along with a higher growth forecast, the IMF on Wednesday recommended China speed up reforms to transition its economy to more sustainable growth and adopt less accommodative monetary policy.  The critically important recent focus on tackling financial sector risks should continue, even if it entails some financial tensions and slower growth,  IMF deputy managing director David Lipton told reporters in Beijing. China needs to ensure that  where credit is granted, it is backing economic activity that will be useful, that will be supportive of growth and will permit debts to be serviced without difficultly,  he said. Beijing should also resume progress towards a flexible exchange rate, Lipton said, while adding that the IMF assesses the yuan currency to be  broadly in line with fundamentals . The strengthening U.S. economy, albeit with normalising interest rates, is likely to be useful for the rest of the world, Lipton said. The IMF official said President Xi Jinping's speech at Davos in January was the start of China playing  a kind of leadership role at a time when there is a dialogue going on around the world about the path of globalisation.

In a rare interview, Wang Kai, general manager of the policy lender's treasury department, said EXIM 2544.HK expects to issue $2-$4 billion in dollar- and euro-denominated bonds in the second half of the year. It issued $5.1 billion of euro and dollar bonds last year.  Our need for foreign currency funds is diversifying by the day, and the amount will steadily grow,  Wang told Reuters late on Tuesday. EXIM, owned by the finance ministry and central bank, plays a critical role in providing export financing and government-directed lending to other countries. China's President Xi Jinping last month pledged more than $100 billion for the Beijing-led Belt and Road initiative that aims to boost infrastructure and trade links between Asia, Africa, Europe and beyond. EXIM has agreed to support more than 1,200 Belt and Road programs worth more than 700 billion yuan ($103 billion) - equivalent to 30 percent of the bank's total end-2016 loan volume. Last month, the bank launched a $30 billion Eximbank Funding Program, comprising $27 billion in medium-term notes and $3 billion in euro commercial paper. The finance ministry said on Tuesday that China plans to issue its first dollar-denominated sovereign bonds since 2004, which Wang said could indicate how much pricing has been impacted by Moody's recent downgrade on China's sovereign ratings.  The international market will gradually realize China's credit strength. Based on current pricing levels, there's actually space (for the credit spread) to narrow,  Wang said. Longer-Term Maturity EXIM and two other Chinese policy lenders - China Development Bank and Agricultural Development Bank of China - also had their long-term issuer ratings downgraded by Moody's. The downgrade  could be a mistake , Wang said, as China is moving to address its debt problems and promote stable development. A week after the one-notch downgrade, EXIM's head office and its Paris branch launched a dual-currency offering. Investor demand allowed the issuer to price the new bonds flat to existing bonds as orders were two and three times the euro tranche and the dollar tranche, respectively.  As a sovereign-linked issuer, we have the responsibility to do a benchmark offering to stabilize the market and provide the market with a clear direction,  Wang said. Without giving a timeframe, Wang said he expected EXIM to issue more long-term, fixed-rate dollar-denominated debt, which would cap liability costs in the long run, pointing to the flattening U.S. treasury yield curve and market expectations of two U.S. interest rate hikes this year. EXIM, he said, would consider issuing dollar-denominated bonds with maturities of up to 30 years. Presently, the longest maturity for EXIM's dollar bonds is 10 years. The bank also plans to increase its euro-denominated bond program and gradually lengthen the maturity to more than 7 years, from the current 5-year maximum, Wang said. Separately, EXIM plans to raise 650 billion yuan through the sale of yuan-denominated bonds this year, up from 633 billion yuan in 2016, he said, adding the bank would consider issuing supplementary capital to boost financial strength. EXIM's capital structure mainly comprises Tier-1 capital. Reporting by Shu Zhang and Umesh Desai; Editing by Ian Geoghegan","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-exim-idUSKBN1950U5"},

Fitch has also downgraded Greenland's senior unsecured rating and the ratings of all outstanding bonds to 'BB'. The downgrade of the IDR follows the downgrade of Greenland's standalone rating to 'BB-' from 'BB' and the incorporation of a one-notch uplift reflecting its moderate linkage with its parent, the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC) of Shanghai Municipality, in line with Fitch's Parent and Subsidiary Linkage criteria. The downgrade of the standalone rating is driven by Greenland's persistent high leverage of above 60% as the company remained aggressive in expanding its land bank in 2016. Leverage, as measured by net debt-to-adjusted inventory, had reached 67% by end-2016. The Negative Outlook reflects our view that Greenland's cash collection of its pre-sold commercial properties in 2017 is likely be below our previous understanding, and this may keep leverage sustained above 65% - the level at which we may consider further negative rating action. KEY RATING DRIVERS Hard to Deleverage: Fitch's expectation that leverage may exceed 65% in 2017 and 2018 is due to construction expenditure likely to remain high even as the company slowed down its attributable land acquisition to about CNY8 billion in 5M17. Greenland has been reducing the proportion of commercial property sales, which came down to 36% in 2016 from 49% in 2015. The cash-collection ratio also improved to 79% from 59% in 2015, though it is still behind the industry average of 90% in 2016. The low cash-collection rate is a result of its high exposure to sales of commercial property development that has a slower sales collection rate than for residential property sales. Large Construction Expenditure Commitment: Fitch believes Greenland's rapid construction pace will continue to pressure leverage. Greenland's new construction start gross floor area (GFA) totalled 19.3 million square metres (sqm) in 2016, and this outpaced its land-acquisition GFA of 14.9 million sqm. The 2016 completed GFA of 22.7 million sqm was faster than both construction starts and new land added. Greenland's aggressive pace of construction resulted in completed properties available for sale growing significantly in 2016 to CNY93 billion from CNY49 billion in 2015. The build-up of unsold completed properties can be a cash drain, and a persistent rising trend of unsold completed properties may also reflect uncertainties of its property sales. Contracted Sales Growth to Slow: Fitch expects Greenland's contracted sales to be sustained at around CNY280 billion in 2017, slowing down in 2H17 as the Chinese authorities continue to implement increasingly stricter measures to curb property prices and restrict residential property transactions. Contracted sales rose by 11% to CNY255 billion in 2016. This trend had maintained its momentum earlier in 2017, with contracted sales growing by 17.9% yoy in 1Q17. Non-Property Adds to Leverage Pressure: Fitch believes that Greenland's non-property businesses are still immature and will need to be funded with cash flow generated from the property business. Greenland has made extensive investments in the financial institutions (FI), consumer goods and infrastructure industries. All these have contributed to the increase in leverage. Benefits of Large Scale: Greenland is one of the top property developers in China as measured by contracted sales. Its property-development business is well diversified in over 40 cities in China and overseas. The company intends to sustain contracted sales of over CNY200 billion in the next few years. One-Notch Parental Support: Greenland has moderately strong linkages with the Shanghai government. It will continue to be one of the major contributors to Shanghai's tax revenue among Shanghai SASAC-owned enterprises, and remain the largest Shanghai-based property company. Fitch believes the Shanghai SASAC, which owns 46% of Greenland, will continue to be the biggest shareholder and exert influence on Greenland's ability to acquire quality sites for development. DERIVATION SUMMARY Greenland's rating is supported by its business profile - including scale as measured by contracted sales and EBITDA, and its market position. However, its rating is constrained by higher leverage than most of the 'BB' category peers and relatively low contracted sales efficiencies (measured by contracted sales/gross debt) - due to its higher exposure to the commercial property segments. Greenland's peers, like China Evergrande Group (B+/Stable) and Sunac China Holdings Limited (BB/Negative), are similarly aggressive in expanding their scale, and are among the 10 largest Chinese homebuilders. Greenland's leverage is as high as that of Evergrande, but Greenland has a large level of uncollected sales to mitigate its high leverage. Greenland, as a state-owned enterprise, has a stronger position in acquiring land at low costs, especially for new city districts that local governments are keen to develop. This enhances Greenland's business profile over that of Evergrande and Sunac. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: - Contracted sales to increase by 13% in 2017 and slow to 5% in 2018. - Sales of commercial property to form 40% of total sales, and residential sales to make up the remainder in 2017-2019 - Land premium of around CNY75 billion-90 billion in 2017-2019. RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive: Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action on the Ratings Include: The Outlook on the standalone ratings may be revised to Stable if the negative guidelines are not met in the next 12 months. Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action: Net debt/adjusted inventory sustained above 65% (Fitch estimate for 2016: 67%) Property EBITDA margin sustained below 15% (Fitch estimate for 2016: 16%) Contracted sales/total debt sustained below 0.8x (Fitch estimate for 2016: 0.9x) Evidence of weakening support from parent. LIQUIDITY Greenland had cash of CNY60 billion at end-2016, which is not sufficient to cover its short-term debt of CNY96 billion. However, the company had CNY105 billion of available bank facilities and the capability to raise funds through multiple channels domestically.

Central European assets were mostly rangebound as investors awaited a meeting of the Federal Reserve.     The crown eased marginally, by less than 0.1 percent against the euro by 0808 GMT.     But trading at 26.16, it was drifting away from overnight highs at 26.13, its strongest level since the CNB in April removed a cap at 27 on the currency, and also since late 2013 when the cap was introduced.     The crown's strengthening, partly fuelled by expectations for a rebound in inflation and CNB rate hikes, received fresh impetus on Tuesday by recommendations from banks including Citigroup that investors should buy it.     But Tomsik, who is regarded as a dovish rate setter, was quoted by the newspaper Hospodarske Noviny as saying that the crown had got stronger since the bank's latest outlook which indicated rates rising in the second half of 2017.      (This) means that we do not need to hurry quickly with raising rates,  he said.     Even a delay to the fourth quarter from the third would retain a gap with markets which have priced in a hike only for he second quarter of 2018, Komercni Banka trader Dalimil Vyskovski said, adding that Tomsik's comments were  somewhat surprising .      Market rates now (are) increasingly in a 'conundrum' mode,  he said.     An auction of Czech government bonds could draw average demand on Wednesday, he added.     Investors in Prague usually ignore political events, such as a meeting of Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka's party on Wednesday, which stands to lose elections in October, to discuss the party leadership.     In Romania, the ruling Social Democrats also meet late on Wednesday to decide whether to reshuffle the government and possibly dismiss Prime Minister Sorin Grindeanu.      The leu eased a shade to 4.567 versus the euro.     Investors in the region seek cues from the U.S. Federal Reserve's guidance over its rate hike cycle.     The central bank is likely to go ahead with another 25-basis-point rate increase on Wednesday, the fourth hike of a rate increase cycle that started in December 2015.     The zloty eased to 4.1945 against the euro.      We think that there is a risk that a Fed rate hike could exert negative pressure on the (zloty),  BZ BWK analysts said.      The tone of Fed after the meeting may create pressure for Polish IRS rates and bond yields to rise, and the holiday in Poland tomorrow may strengthen this reaction,  they said.     Stocks were rangebound in the region, but Budapest's main index hit another record high, briefly piercing the 36,000-point psychological level.

Broader emerging stocks and currencies inched up however before a U.S. Federal Reserve meeting that is expected to deliver a rate rise. But unless accompanied by unexpectedly hawkish language, emerging markets are unlikely to be impacted. MSCI's emerging equity index has failed to make much headway after hitting successive two-year highs and China's tepid investment data, reinforcing the picture of slower growth, could ensure markets continue to move sideways. The benchmark rose 0.2 percent, up for the second straight day after Monday's tech-driven selloff, for year-to-date gains of over 17 percent  Emerging markets have plateaued a bit as people want to see what the Fed does and if it downgrades inflation expectations the dollar  will sell off and that's good news for EM,  said Peter Kinsella, head of FX and rates strategy at Commonwealth Bank of Australia.  Commodity prices too are way below the levels we saw before so some good news on commodities will be well-received.  Shanghai and Shenzen-listed shares fell 0.7 percent and 1.3 percent respectively  after the data while shares in companies partly owned by Anbang Insurance Group tumbled after its head resigned. Russian shares lost 0.6 percent and Moscow is this year's worst performing emerging equity market in dollar terms. A fresh headwind is U.S. legislation that could impose new sanctions on Russia and prevents the White House from easing or ending sanctions without congressional approval. Russian assets have also been hurt by oil's 10 percent decline since late-May and a hawkish central bank stance that has allowed the rouble to shrug off crude price weakness. The rouble was flat on the day despite a one percent fall in Brent futures  The latest oil price action is ominous for Russian equities and the rouble's de-coupling from oil compounds the blow for Russian oil stocks,  Christopher Granville at TS Lombard wrote, predicting the pace of Russian rate cuts to slow to 25 bps. Rouble strength means investors should be overweight on retail-oriented domestic stocks while selling export-oriented ones, especially those in oil and gas, he advised clients in a note. Qatari stocks meanwhile bounced almost 1 percent to a three-day high while the riyal also firmed slightly in forward markets against the dollar, off record lows. In central Europe, Hungarian stocks jumped 1 percent to new record highs, lifted by pharma blue-chip Gideon Richter and OTP Bank which gained 1.7 percent and 1.2 percent respectively.

We believe generally that the real economy is firming up and if we believe in these measures, then we should be just a bit more patient.   We don't necessarily need to think that more measures are necessary. They will work their way through the system,  Hansson, Estonia's central bank chief, said. He added that when assessing the impact of the ECB's work, the accumulated stock of stimulus must also be considered, not just the fresh impulses.

Despite Saudi cuts, it's shipping more oil: Russell","keywords":"Angola,Brazil,China,Libya,Nigeria,Russia,Saudi Arabia,United Kingdom,United States,US,COLUMN,RUSSELL,OPEC,CRUDE,Energy Markets,Russia,Commentaries,Crude Oil,Energy (Legacy),Saudi Arabia,Asia / Pacific,Major News,Middle East,Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries,Marine Services (TRBC),China (PRC),Corporate Events,Economic Events,Oil and Gas (TRBC),Refined Products,Oil Refineries,English,Europe,Commodities News (3rd Party),Reports,Emerging Market Countries","sector":"","content":"LAUNCESTON, Australia (Reuters) - OPEC has finally acknowledged what the oil market already knows, namely that rebalancing is taking longer than expected. Perhaps this is because OPEC is actually shipping more crude. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries prefers to talk about output when assessing the impact of the deal among members and 11 allied countries to reduce production by 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd). While output is no doubt important, for the immediate market impact it's probably better to focus on what the group is actually exporting. Vessel-tracking and port data in Thomson Reuters Eikon shows that for the first five months of 2017, OPEC exported 25.6 million bpd. This figure is only shipments by tanker and is filtered to show vessels that have already discharged, are discharging or are en route to their destination. The shipments for the first five months of this year are slightly higher than the 25.4 million bpd the producer group exported via tankers in the same period in 2016. In May, OPEC shipments were 25.6 million bpd, up from April's 25.02 million bpd, according to the vessel-tracking data. The increase in exports via tanker was also reflected in higher output by the group, which said in a report on Tuesday that it produced 32.14 million bpd in May, up 336,000 bpd from the prior month. The increase was largely because members that are exempt from the output cuts agreed in November, such as Libya and Nigeria, increased production after prior curtailments due to civil unrest. Nonetheless, the increase in output and exports via tanker show the scale of the challenge facing OPEC, and its de facto leader Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest crude exporter. The Saudis are carrying the bulk of the output reductions among OPEC members, and the shipping data suggest they are doing their part by lowering exports as well. In the first five months of 2017 Saudi Arabia exported 7.48 million bpd via tankers, down 440,000 bpd from 7.92 million bpd in the same period in 2016. This reduction in exports is close to the 500,000 bpd output cut pledged by the Saudis in terms of the November agreement, which was extended last month to March 2018. Saudis Stand Alone? The problem for the Saudis is that it appears fellow OPEC members aren't doing as much to help the cause of rebalancing oil markets and therefore boosting prices. It's the sort of situation that's unlikely to persist, with the Saudis likely to demand more compliance from OPEC and the 11 allied producers, including Russia. If the Saudis don't see meaningful reductions in output and exports by its allies, it's likely that they will be forced to scale back the extent of their output and export reductions. The dilemma facing the Saudis is encapsulated by China, the world's largest crude oil importer and the Saudis biggest customer. China imported 12.5 percent more oil in the first four months of this year, but imports from Saudi Arabia rose by a paltry 2.5 percent. In contrast, China's imports from fellow OPEC member Angola jumped 13.3 percent and those from allied producer Russia gained 8.1 percent. This shows that the Saudis are not only surrendering market share in China, they are partly giving it up to countries that are supposed to be joining the kingdom in output cuts. In addition, producers outside the agreement to cut output are gleefully snaring increased market share in China. Imports from Brazil jumped 41.2 percent in the first four months of the year compared to the same period in 2016, making the South American nation China's seventh-largest supplier. While rising from small bases, it's worth noting that China's imports from Britain are up 245 percent and those from the United States 3,886 percent.  Taken together, these two non-traditional suppliers to China accounted for 3 percent of the country's imports in the first four months of the year. That may not sound like a lot, but it equates to about 260,000 bpd in British and U.S. exports to China. The Saudis may well look at that figure and think that they should have supplied that crude to China, but they haven't in the name of rebalancing the market. It's not like the Saudis are enjoying significantly higher prices, with Brent crude ending on Tuesday at $48.72 a barrel, perilously close to the $46.38 close the day before the Nov. 30 deal between OPEC and its allies. It seems the Saudis have given up much to get little in return.

(Reuters) - Virginia's lieutenant governor will face a former Republican national committee chairman in a November general election to become the state's next governor in a race seen as a bellwether for next year's mid-term congressional races. Lieutenant Governor Ralph Northam bested former congressman Tom Perriello in the Democratic primary, while former Republican National Committee Chairman Ed Gillespie topped President Donald Trump's former Virginia campaign co-chairman Corey Stewart, according to unofficial returns posted online by the Virginia Department of Elections. The gubernatorial race in Virginia, the only state other than New Jersey electing a new governor this year, is seen as a key test of Trump's popularity ahead of the 2018 mid-term elections for the Republican-controlled U.S. Senate and House of Representatives. The winner in November will succeed incumbent Democratic Governor Terry McAuliffe, who is barred by term limits from running again. Northam sought to stoke Democrats' anger toward Trump, calling the president a  narcissistic maniac  in statewide ads.  Tonight, we're one step closer to building a Virginia that works for everyone - no matter who you are, no matter where you're from,  Northam said in a Twitter post declaring victory. U.S. Representative Tom Perriello (D-VA)  listens to U.S. President Barack Obama during a rally in Charlottesville, Virginia October 29,  2010.Kevin LamarqueIn the Republican primary, Gillespie beat Stewart 44 percent to 42 percent with Frank Wagner earning 14 percent of the vote. On the Democrat side, 56 percent vote went to Northam and 44 percent went to Perriello, unofficial returns showed.  The governor's race in Virginia, a swing state where a recent Washington Post and George Mason University poll showed 59 percent of voters disapprove of Trump's performance, is shaping up as a pivotal battleground with national implications.      Slideshow (5 Images) Virginia will be more hotly contested than ever,  said Stephen Farnsworth, a University of Mary Washington political analyst.  All the national money and national attention will be coming this way. ... Republicans want to claim that the Trump movement is doing well and the Democrats want to claim it is not.  Northam was backed by every statewide Democratic officeholder, while Perriello drew support of Democratic progressives, including U.S. Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.  Gillespie was endorsed by a raft of state and national Republican leaders. On the campaign trail, he largely avoided talking about Trump, who has not weighed in on the race. Republican strength has eroded in recent Virginia elections, with Democrats now holding all statewide offices. Virginia, once a Republican bulwark in presidential polls, has gone Democratic in three straight elections.

The Outlooks are Stable. ALL is the main life insurance entity and the top holding company of the ALTE LEIPZIGER group. Fitch views ALL and ALV as 'core' members of the group, and their ratings are based on a combined assessment. KEY RATING DRIVERS The ratings reflect the group's strong capitalisation, continued healthy investment returns and sustainable market position in the disability line and corporate pension scheme business. Offsetting these strengths include the group's lack of geographical diversification and the long-term adverse implications of continued low interest rates for German life insurers. Fitch assesses the group's capitalisation, as measured by the agency's Prism factor-based model (Prism FBM), as 'extremely strong' based on end-2016 results. This is further supported by a regulatory group solvency II margin of 295% at end-2016 without using transitional measures. Fitch expects the group to maintain its Prism FBM score of 'extremely strong' and a strong solvency II margin of more than 150% for 2017. Fitch views the group's capital resources as strong. ALL's shareholder funds (measured as a proportion of actuarial reserves) were 4.2% at end-2016, above our expectation for the market average of 1.9%. Funds for future appropriation, including terminal bonus funds, (also measured as a proportion of actuarial reserves) were 5.5%, also higher than our expectation for the market average of 5.1%. Fitch views ALL as better placed than many of its competitors to service its guaranteed interest rate (GIR) payments while investment yields remain low. This is due to its longer asset duration, a strong technical result benefitting from the high proportion of disability business in its books, and its high level of equity and funds for future appropriation. Fitch estimates that if low investment yields persist, ALL would be able to make GIR payments using its investment income for the next 20 years without recourse to other profit sources (assuming a reinvestment yield of only 1.5%). However, current operating conditions are putting pressure on German life insurers' profitability. The group's return on equity (RoE) decreased to 7.3% in 2016, from 8.7% in 2015. Fitch expects the RoE to decline to 5%-7% in 2017 and further deterioration in the group's profitability in the coming years, due to persistently low interest rates. Based on Fitch's analysis, ALL is one of Germany's top five providers of disability insurance. ALL also writes significant amounts of the corporate pension scheme business, which supports the strong development of its regular premium business. The group only distributes its products in Germany, which limits its geographical diversification. Focus on the domestic market is typical of medium-sized companies such as ALL. ALL's gross written premiums (GWP) increased 0.7% in 2016 (2015: up 7%), while we estimate the life insurance market to have fallen 1.5% (2015: down 2.5%). ALL's GWP outperformance was driven by a 2% increase in the single premium business, against an estimated 4% decline for the market. The group increased its equity investments to 4.7% of total investment in 2016 (2015: 3.4%), which was slightly more than the German life insurance market average of 4.4% at end-2016. The group reported GWP of EUR2.8 billion and had total assets of EUR26.2 billion at end-2016. It also has a building society and investment fund business. The group has a cooperation agreement with mutual health insurer HALLESCHE Krankenversicherung auf Gegenseitigkeit. RATING SENSITIVITIES An upgrade in the near- to medium-term is unlikely unless the group increases its size and improves diversification, while maintaining strong capitalisation. Key triggers for a downgrade include a significantly depleted capital position (as evidenced, for example, by the Prism FBM score falling to 'strong' and expected to remain at that level) and a loss of the group's strong market position in the disability and corporate pension scheme business.

Owned by 43-year-old artist Marcus Bracey, the gallery in Walthamstow, called 'God's Own Junkyard', houses the collection of four generations of his family who have made, bought and displayed neon works. The pieces are accompanied by kitsch memorabilia that Bracey has collected from film sets and car boot sales across Britain, leaving just enough room for a narrow winding aisle for visitors to navigate their way through the gallery.  This is my neon emporium, my museum of light, my Aladdin's cave,  Bracey told Reuters from the center of the high-ceilinged studio which runs up an electricity bill of over 700 pounds ($900) a week.

Police have so far detained 78 of the lawyers, some believed to be users of ByLock, an encrypted messaging app the government says was used by Gulen's followers.  Since the July coup attempt, authorities have jailed pending trial 50,000 people and sacked or suspended 150,000, including soldiers, police, teachers and public servants, over alleged links with terrorist groups, including Gulen's network. Erdogan says the crackdown is necessary due to the gravity of the coup attempt in which 240 people were killed.

The Paris-based IEA said production outside the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries would grow twice as quickly in 2018 as it will do this year, when OPEC and 11 partner nations have restrained output.  For total non-OPEC production, we expect production to grow by 700,000 bpd this year, but our first outlook for 2018 makes sobering reading for those producers looking to restrain supply,  the IEA said.  In 2018, we expect non-OPEC production to grow by 1.5 million bpd which is slightly more than the expected increase in global demand.   Brent crude futures extended losses after the report, falling 64 cents on the day to $48.08 a barrel by 0804 GMT, from around $48.26 prior to the release. Oil inventories across the world's most industrial nations rose in April by 18.6 million barrels to 3.045 billion barrels, thanks to higher refinery output and imports. The IEA said stocks were 292 million barrels above the five-year average.  The agency continued to forecast an implied shortfall in supply relative to demand for the second quarter of this year. But it said slowing demand growth in China and Europe in particular, as well as increasing supply, meant the deficit should narrow to 500,000 bpd from a prior estimate of 700,000. OPEC and 11 rival exporters including Russia have agreed to extend a deal to limit supply by 1.8 million bpd to March 2018, in order to cut global inventory levels. Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih has reiterated the group's commitment to do  whatever it takes  to force a drawdown in global inventory levels.  We have regularly counseled that patience is required on the part of those looking for the rebalancing of the oil market, and new data leads us to repeat the message,  the IEA said.   'Whatever it takes' might be the mantra, but the current form of 'whatever' is not having as quick an impact as expected.   Indeed, based on our current outlook for 2017 and 2018, incorporating the scenario that OPEC countries continue to comply with their output agreement, stocks might not fall to the desired level until close to the expiry of the agreement in March 2018,  the IEA said. u.s. Output Rises The price of oil has fallen 12 percent since May 25, when OPEC and its partners agreed to extend their supply cut, as inventories around the world have been slow to drain. Rising output from the United States has been one of the main factors behind the stubbornly high stock levels and the IEA estimates U.S. production will continue to grow aggressively into next year.  Our first look at 2018 suggests that U.S. crude production will grow year-on-year by 780,000 but such is the dynamism of this extraordinary, very diverse industry it is possible that growth will be faster,  the agency said. The forecast for U.S. total oil production for 2017 has been revised 90,000 bpd higher, to average 13.1 million bpd, following further rig additions and increased spending. Crude output from OPEC nations rose by 290,000 bpd in May to a 2017 high of 32.08 million bpd, still within the confines of the supply deal, after comebacks in Libya and Nigeria, which are exempt from cuts.  Compared to May 2016, OPEC crude production was down by 65,000 bpd, the IEA said. Non-OPEC output rose by 295,000 bpd month-on-month in May to 57.8 million bpd, 1.25 million bpd higher than a year earlier.

The widely expected quarter-point interest rate hike will take the Fed funds target rate above 1 percent for the first time since the immediate aftermath of the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008. Market participants' focus will be on signals on the frequency of further hikes and how the Fed plans to unwind its huge Treasury bond stockpile over the years ahead. The U.S. central bank is scheduled to release its decision at 1800 GMT on Wednesday with a news conference to follow from Chair Janet Yellen.  With financial conditions remaining supportive ... and US financials breaking higher, the Fed may see little reason to moderate its rate hike projections when meeting today,  strategists at Morgan Stanley said in a note to clients. The U.S. bank expects the dollar to gain 2 percent against major currencies over the next few weeks. On Wednesday, the dollar index barely budged as slightly firmer moves against the euro and yen were offset by losses against the commodity bloc of currencies, such as the Australian and Canadian dollars. Worries about the pace of global growth and weakness in markets for the commodities they produce drove a 5-percent slide in the values of both Australia's and Canada's dollars between March and May. Relatively upbeat economic data from China and a surge in expectations of higher Canadian interest rates have helped currencies of commodities-related economies. Optimism about the global economy also underpinned European equities where the pan-European STOXX 600 was up 0.6 percent, led by industrials and financials. Stocks on Wall Streets hit a record high overnight. However, worries about valuations, particularly in the tech sector which nosedived last week, are on the rise. A record number of investors said equities are overvalued and three-quarters said internet stocks are expensive or in a bubble, a Bank of America Merrill Lynch fund manager poll showed on Tuesday Strategists at Deutsche Bank warned that its European  complacency indicator , which measures valuations relative to market volatility, was at an 11-year high, and the bank expects economic momentum to fade in coming months. The MSCI All-Country World index was up 0.1 percent and has remained stuck in a tight range this month. Europe's benchmark bond yield held near seven-week lows ahead of the Fed decision. In commodities, oil prices fell more than 1 percent, on the backfoot again on worries about US oversupply. Brent crude oil was down 45 cents a barrel at $48.27 while U.S. crude was 50 cents lower at $45.96.

Simone Rossi, 47, will take up the post of chief executive at EDF Energy in November, succeeding Vincent de Rivaz, who is retiring after 15 years as CEO of the unit. Rossi, who joined EDF in 2004, will be in charge of the 18 billion pound ($23 billion) project to build two nuclear reactors at Hinkley Point C on Britain's west coast. The contract was signed in September 2016 and construction began this year. The reactors are due to start up in 2025. Rossi's role will include keeping the project on track, when similar Areva-designed European Pressurized Reactor (EPR) projects in France, Finland and China are running late and over budget.  There will be a change of style. De Rivaz was a bulldozer who battled for years to get the contract signed. Rossi is a fine strategist, who listens to people,  said an EDF executive who has worked with both men. Rossi, who was chief financial officer of EDF Energy from 2011 to 2015, also previously held the post of CFO at EDF's U.S. joint venture Constellation Energy Nuclear Group before EDF pulled out of U.S. nuclear industry. As head of EDF's international operations, Rossi oversaw EDF investments in Africa and Latin America, including the Bolero solar plant in Chile, hydro power projects in Cameroon and Brazil and an off-grid solar project in West Africa. Rossi, a clarinet player, will in his new role have to navigate the UK energy market where EDF is one of six big suppliers facing public and government criticism for energy bills that have doubled in the past decade to about 1,200 pounds ($1,640) a year. The ruling Conservative Party pledged to cap domestic energy prices in its election campaign, but Prime Minister Theresa May's failure to secure a majority in last week's poll could reduce the risk of more state intervention in power pricing.

Â Â Â  The Trump administration has said the bulk of its plan for overhauling bank regulation can be done via executive order and through regulators, rather than requiring legislation from Congress. But Trump is months away from installing top officials at key regulatory posts to carry out his agenda.  We won't see policy changes before the end of the year,  said Rich Foster, senior counsel for regulatory and legal affairs at the Financial Services Roundtable, a trade group. Trump has gradually been nominating heads of financial agencies, but only Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Jay Clayton have been approved by Congress. Other agencies are either awaiting presidential picks or are operating under  acting  chiefs. Others have leaders appointed by Trump's Democratic predecessor, President Barack Obama. The Federal Reserve has already signaled it will make its stress testing of banks more transparent and is considering other steps to simplify the process, in line with Treasury's recommendations. But the Treasury called for even more significant changes, including having the Fed overhaul its testing models and assumptions. Such changes may have to wait until the administration has appointed a vice chair in charge of banking oversight at the Fed. Randal Quarles, a veteran of the George W. Bush administration, is expected to be Trump's pick for the Fed's top bank regulator, people familiar with the matter have told Reuters. He has not been named publicly while he is being vetted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Office of Government Ethics. Â Â Â  Once he is named, he will have to be confirmed by the Senate -- a process that could easily slide into the fall with Congress facing a busy calendar and an upcoming five-week congressional recess from the end of July to the beginning of September. Analysis by the Bipartisan Policy Center, a Washington think tank, has found that since 1989, it has taken an average of 149 days for a financial regulatory nominee to receive Senate confirmation after being announced. Â Â Â  Quarles has declined to comment on speculation about the possible nomination.  Meanwhile, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is being managed by an interim Trump pick, Keith Noreika, while the Senate considers Joseph Otting for the top role. Otting was nominated earlier this month, but could face a contentious confirmation. Senator Sherrod Brown, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee that will consider the pick, has already announced his opposition, citing his time as an executive at OneWest Bank and that firm's foreclosure practices. In addition to Clayton at the SEC, Christopher Giancarlo, the acting chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, is already in position, awaiting full confirmation to take on the role full-time. But at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Obama appointee Martin Gruenberg intends to serve his full term, which expires in November. Treasury's plans to ease some of the restrictions around banks' trading, living wills and their adherence to international banking accords could face resistance from him, given his role in drafting many existing rules. An FDIC spokesperson declined to comment. Â Â Â Â The Treasury report also focuses significant attention on overhauling mortgage rules. But that would require cooperation from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau which wrote many of them. That agency's Obama-appointed director, Richard Cordray, has a term that does not expire until summer 2018. The CFPB, created in the wake of the financial crisis, receives its funding through the Federal Reserve and Trump can only fire Cordray  for cause,  an almost impossible standard to meet. That leaves few levers the administration can pull to get the agency to reorganize its internal operations or make the suggested changes on mortgages.  Â Â Â  Cordray will probably do nothing more than subject Trump's proposals to  long-term analysis,  said Quyen Truong, a partner at law firm Stroock & Stroock & Lavan, which in Washington means he will shelve it. Truong was the assistant director and deputy general counsel for the CFPB until early 2016. Â Â Â   The changes proposed by the study go to fundamental aspects of the CFPB's philosophy and operations,  she said.  The CFPB likely will not confront directly those proposals.  A CFPB spokesperson said the agency was reviewing the report, but had no further comment at this time.  A Treasury spokesperson maintained the administration would be working quickly on its recommendations even as some key posts await Trump picks.  We have strong working relationships with the regulators and considerable dialogue is already underway,  said a Treasury spokesperson.  We plan on working with them to begin swiftly advancing these recommendations.

","sector":"Technology","content":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States appears poised to heighten scrutiny of Chinese investment in Silicon Valley to better shield sensitive technologies seen as vital to U.S. national security, current and former U.S. officials tell Reuters. Of particular concern is China's interest in fields such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, which have increasingly attracted Chinese capital in recent years. The worry is that cutting-edge technologies developed in the United States could be used by China to bolster its military capabilities and perhaps even push it ahead in strategic industries. The U.S. government is now looking to strengthen the role of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), the inter-agency committee that reviews foreign acquisitions of U.S. companies on national security grounds. An unreleased Pentagon report, viewed by Reuters, warns that China is skirting U.S. oversight and gaining access to sensitive technology through transactions that currently don't trigger CFIUS review. Such deals would include joint ventures, minority stakes and early-stage investments in start-ups.  We're examining CFIUS to look at the long-term health and security of the U.S. economy, given China's predatory practices  in technology, said a Trump administration official, who was not authorized to speak publicly. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis weighed into the debate on Tuesday, calling CFIUS  outdated  and telling a Senate hearing:  It needs to be updated to deal with today's situation.   CFIUS is headed by the Treasury Department and includes nine permanent members including representatives from the departments of Defense, Justice, Homeland Security, Commerce, State and Energy. The CFIUS panel is so secretive it normally does not comment after it makes a decision on a deal. Under former President Barack Obama, CFIUS stopped a series of attempted Chinese acquisitions of high-end chip makers.  Senator John Cornyn, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, is now drafting legislation that would give CFIUS far more power to  block some technology investments, a Cornyn aide said.  Artificial intelligence is one of many leading-edge technologies that China seeks and that has potential military applications,  said the Cornyn aide, who declined to be identified.  These technologies are so new that our export control system has not yet figured out how to cover them, which is part of the reason they are slipping through the gaps in the existing safeguards,  the aide said. The legislation would require CFIUS to heighten scrutiny of buyers hailing from nations identified as potential threats to national security. CFIUS would maintain the list, the aide said, without specifying who would create it. Cornyn's legislation would not single out specific technologies that would be subject to CFIUS scrutiny. But it would provide a mechanism for the Pentagon to lead that identification effort, with input from the U.S. technology sector, the Commerce Department, and the Energy Department, the aide said.  James Lewis, an expert on military technology at the Center for Security and International Studies, said the U.S. government is playing catch-up.  The Chinese have found a way around our protections, our safeguards, on technology transfer in foreign investment. And they're using it to pull ahead of us, both economically and militarily,  Lewis said.  I think that's a big deal.  But some industry experts warn that stronger U.S. regulations may not succeed in halting technology transfer and might trigger retaliation by China, with economic repercussions for the United States. In Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said Chinese investment should not be  politically overinterpreted  or  interfered with politically .  We hope the United States can provide a good environment for Chinese companies investing in the United States,  Lu told a regular news briefing on Wednesday.  China made the United States the top destination for its foreign direct investment in 2016, with $45.6 billion in completed acquisitions and greenfield investments, according to the Rhodium Group, a research firm. Investment from January to May 2017 totaled $22 billion, which represented a 100 percent increase against the same period last year, it said.  There will be a significant pushback from the technology industry  if legislation is overly aggressive, Rhodium Group economist Thilo Hanemann said.   Ai's Role in Drone Warfare An MQ-9 Reaper remotely piloted drone aircraft performs aerial maneuvers over Creech Air Force Base, Nevada, U.S., June 25, 2015. U.S. Air Force/Senior Airman Cory D. Payne/Handout via REUTERSConcerns about Chinese inroads into advanced technology come as the U.S. military looks to incorporate elements of artificial intelligence and machine learning into its drone program.  Project Maven, as the effort is known, aims to provide some relief to military analysts who are part of the war against Islamic State.  These analysts currently spend long hours staring at big screens reviewing video feeds from drones as part of the hunt for insurgents in places like Iraq and Afghanistan.    The Pentagon is trying to develop algorithms that would sort through the material and alert analysts to important finds, according to Air Force Lieutenant General John N.T.  Jack  Shanahan, director for defense intelligence for warfighting support.  A lot of times these things are flying around(and)... there's nothing in the scene that's of interest,  he told Reuters. Shanahan said his team is currently trying to teach the system to recognize objects such as trucks and buildings, identify people and, eventually, detect changes in patterns of daily life that could signal significant developments.  We'll start small, show some wins,  he said.  A Pentagon official said the U.S. government is requesting to spend around $30 million on the effort in 2018. FILE PHOTO: U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis testifies before the Senate Armed Services Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., U.S., June 13, 2017.Aaron P. Bernstein/File PhotoSimilar image recognition technology is being developed commercially by firms in Silicon Valley, which could be adapted by adversaries for military reasons.  Shanahan said he was not surprised Chinese firms were making investments there.  They know what they're targeting,  he said. Research firm CB Insights says it has tracked 29 investors from mainland China investing in U.S. artificial intelligence  companies since the start of 2012.   The risks extend beyond technology transfer.  When the Chinese make an investment in an early stage company developing advanced technology, there is an opportunity cost to the U.S., since that company is potentially off-limits for purposes of working with (the Department of Defense),  the report said. Chinese Investment China has made no secret of its ambition to become a major player in artificial intelligence, including through foreign acquisitions.   Chinese search engine giant Baidu Inc (BIDU.O) launched an AI lab in March with China's state planner, the National Development and Reform Commission. In just one recent example, Baidu Inc agreed in April to acquire U.S. computer vision firm xPerception, which makes vision perception software and hardware with applications in robotics and virtual reality.  China is investing massively in this space,  said Peter Singer, an expert on robotic warfare at the New America Foundation. The draft Pentagon report cautioned that one of the factors hindering U.S. government regulation was that many Chinese investments fall short of outright acquisitions that can trigger a CFIUS review. Export controls were not designed to govern early-stage technology.  It recommended that the Pentagon develop a critical technologies list and restrict Chinese investments on that list. It also proposed enhancing counterintelligence efforts. The report also signaled the need for measures beyond the scope of the U.S. military, such as changing immigration policy to allow Chinese graduate students to stay in the United States after completing their studies, instead of returning home.

The Paris-based IEA said production outside the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries would grow twice as quickly in 2018 as it will do this year, when OPEC and 11 partner nations have restrained output.  For total non-OPEC production, we expect production to grow by 700,000 bpd this year, but our first outlook for 2018 makes sobering reading for those producers looking to restrain supply,  the IEA said.  In 2018, we expect non-OPEC production to grow by 1.5 million bpd which is slightly more than the expected increase in global demand.   Brent crude futures extended losses after the report, falling 64 cents on the day to $48.08 a barrel by 0804 GMT, from around $48.26 prior to the release. Oil inventories across the world's most industrial nations rose in April by 18.6 million barrels to 3.045 billion barrels, thanks to higher refinery output and imports. The IEA said stocks were 292 million barrels above the five-year average.  The agency continued to forecast an implied shortfall in supply relative to demand for the second quarter of this year. But it said slowing demand growth in China and Europe in particular, as well as increasing supply, meant the deficit should narrow to 500,000 bpd from a prior estimate of 700,000. OPEC and 11 rival exporters including Russia have agreed to extend a deal to limit supply by 1.8 million bpd to March 2018, in order to cut global inventory levels. Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih has reiterated the group's commitment to do  whatever it takes  to force a drawdown in global inventory levels.  We have regularly counseled that patience is required on the part of those looking for the rebalancing of the oil market, and new data leads us to repeat the message,  the IEA said.   'Whatever it takes' might be the mantra, but the current form of 'whatever' is not having as quick an impact as expected.   Indeed, based on our current outlook for 2017 and 2018, incorporating the scenario that OPEC countries continue to comply with their output agreement, stocks might not fall to the desired level until close to the expiry of the agreement in March 2018,  the IEA said. u.s. Output Rises The price of oil has fallen 12 percent since May 25, when OPEC and its partners agreed to extend their supply cut, as inventories around the world have been slow to drain. Rising output from the United States has been one of the main factors behind the stubbornly high stock levels and the IEA estimates U.S. production will continue to grow aggressively into next year.  Our first look at 2018 suggests that U.S. crude production will grow year-on-year by 780,000 but such is the dynamism of this extraordinary, very diverse industry it is possible that growth will be faster,  the agency said. The forecast for U.S. total oil production for 2017 has been revised 90,000 bpd higher, to average 13.1 million bpd, following further rig additions and increased spending. Crude output from OPEC nations rose by 290,000 bpd in May to a 2017 high of 32.08 million bpd, still within the confines of the supply deal, after comebacks in Libya and Nigeria, which are exempt from cuts.  Compared to May 2016, OPEC crude production was down by 65,000 bpd, the IEA said. Non-OPEC output rose by 295,000 bpd month-on-month in May to 57.8 million bpd, 1.25 million bpd higher than a year earlier.

","sector":"Technology","content":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States appears poised to heighten scrutiny of Chinese investment in Silicon Valley to better shield sensitive technologies seen as vital to U.S. national security, current and former U.S. officials tell Reuters. Of particular concern is China's interest in fields such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, which have increasingly attracted Chinese capital in recent years. The worry is that cutting-edge technologies developed in the United States could be used by China to bolster its military capabilities and perhaps even push it ahead in strategic industries. The U.S. government is now looking to strengthen the role of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), the inter-agency committee that reviews foreign acquisitions of U.S. companies on national security grounds. An unreleased Pentagon report, viewed by Reuters, warns that China is skirting U.S. oversight and gaining access to sensitive technology through transactions that currently don't trigger CFIUS review. Such deals would include joint ventures, minority stakes and early-stage investments in start-ups.  We're examining CFIUS to look at the long-term health and security of the U.S. economy, given China's predatory practices  in technology, said a Trump administration official, who was not authorized to speak publicly. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis weighed into the debate on Tuesday, calling CFIUS  outdated  and telling a Senate hearing:  It needs to be updated to deal with today's situation.   CFIUS is headed by the Treasury Department and includes nine permanent members including representatives from the departments of Defense, Justice, Homeland Security, Commerce, State and Energy. The CFIUS panel is so secretive it normally does not comment after it makes a decision on a deal. Under former President Barack Obama, CFIUS stopped a series of attempted Chinese acquisitions of high-end chip makers.  Senator John Cornyn, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, is now drafting legislation that would give CFIUS far more power to  block some technology investments, a Cornyn aide said.  Artificial intelligence is one of many leading-edge technologies that China seeks and that has potential military applications,  said the Cornyn aide, who declined to be identified.  These technologies are so new that our export control system has not yet figured out how to cover them, which is part of the reason they are slipping through the gaps in the existing safeguards,  the aide said. The legislation would require CFIUS to heighten scrutiny of buyers hailing from nations identified as potential threats to national security. CFIUS would maintain the list, the aide said, without specifying who would create it. Cornyn's legislation would not single out specific technologies that would be subject to CFIUS scrutiny. But it would provide a mechanism for the Pentagon to lead that identification effort, with input from the U.S. technology sector, the Commerce Department, and the Energy Department, the aide said.  James Lewis, an expert on military technology at the Center for Security and International Studies, said the U.S. government is playing catch-up.  The Chinese have found a way around our protections, our safeguards, on technology transfer in foreign investment. And they're using it to pull ahead of us, both economically and militarily,  Lewis said.  I think that's a big deal.  But some industry experts warn that stronger U.S. regulations may not succeed in halting technology transfer and might trigger retaliation by China, with economic repercussions for the United States. In Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said Chinese investment should not be  politically overinterpreted  or  interfered with politically .  We hope the United States can provide a good environment for Chinese companies investing in the United States,  Lu told a regular news briefing on Wednesday.  China made the United States the top destination for its foreign direct investment in 2016, with $45.6 billion in completed acquisitions and greenfield investments, according to the Rhodium Group, a research firm. Investment from January to May 2017 totaled $22 billion, which represented a 100 percent increase against the same period last year, it said.  There will be a significant pushback from the technology industry  if legislation is overly aggressive, Rhodium Group economist Thilo Hanemann said.   Ai's Role in Drone Warfare An MQ-9 Reaper remotely piloted drone aircraft performs aerial maneuvers over Creech Air Force Base, Nevada, U.S., June 25, 2015. U.S. Air Force/Senior Airman Cory D. Payne/Handout via REUTERSConcerns about Chinese inroads into advanced technology come as the U.S. military looks to incorporate elements of artificial intelligence and machine learning into its drone program.  Project Maven, as the effort is known, aims to provide some relief to military analysts who are part of the war against Islamic State.  These analysts currently spend long hours staring at big screens reviewing video feeds from drones as part of the hunt for insurgents in places like Iraq and Afghanistan.    The Pentagon is trying to develop algorithms that would sort through the material and alert analysts to important finds, according to Air Force Lieutenant General John N.T.  Jack  Shanahan, director for defense intelligence for warfighting support.  A lot of times these things are flying around(and)... there's nothing in the scene that's of interest,  he told Reuters. Shanahan said his team is currently trying to teach the system to recognize objects such as trucks and buildings, identify people and, eventually, detect changes in patterns of daily life that could signal significant developments.  We'll start small, show some wins,  he said.  A Pentagon official said the U.S. government is requesting to spend around $30 million on the effort in 2018. FILE PHOTO: U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis testifies before the Senate Armed Services Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., U.S., June 13, 2017.Aaron P. Bernstein/File PhotoSimilar image recognition technology is being developed commercially by firms in Silicon Valley, which could be adapted by adversaries for military reasons.  Shanahan said he was not surprised Chinese firms were making investments there.  They know what they're targeting,  he said. Research firm CB Insights says it has tracked 29 investors from mainland China investing in U.S. artificial intelligence  companies since the start of 2012.   The risks extend beyond technology transfer.  When the Chinese make an investment in an early stage company developing advanced technology, there is an opportunity cost to the U.S., since that company is potentially off-limits for purposes of working with (the Department of Defense),  the report said. Chinese Investment China has made no secret of its ambition to become a major player in artificial intelligence, including through foreign acquisitions.   Chinese search engine giant Baidu Inc (BIDU.O) launched an AI lab in March with China's state planner, the National Development and Reform Commission. In just one recent example, Baidu Inc agreed in April to acquire U.S. computer vision firm xPerception, which makes vision perception software and hardware with applications in robotics and virtual reality.  China is investing massively in this space,  said Peter Singer, an expert on robotic warfare at the New America Foundation. The draft Pentagon report cautioned that one of the factors hindering U.S. government regulation was that many Chinese investments fall short of outright acquisitions that can trigger a CFIUS review. Export controls were not designed to govern early-stage technology.  It recommended that the Pentagon develop a critical technologies list and restrict Chinese investments on that list. It also proposed enhancing counterintelligence efforts. The report also signaled the need for measures beyond the scope of the U.S. military, such as changing immigration policy to allow Chinese graduate students to stay in the United States after completing their studies, instead of returning home. Venky Ganesan, managing director at Menlo Futures, concurred about the need to keep the best and brightest in the United States.  The single biggest thing we can do is staple a green card to their diploma so that they stay here and build the technologies here â not go back to their countries and compete against us,  Ganesan said.

The scandal over rigged diesel emissions tests at German carmaker Volkswagen has thrown the engine technology into doubt and has highlighted carmakers' struggle to comply with ever stricter rules capping nitrogen oxides emissions.  As much as I would welcome avoiding such bans, I think it is just as unlikely that we can continue to do without bans in the future,  Munich mayor Dieter Reiter was quoted as saying by Sueddeutsche Zeitung on Wednesday. Asked about the latest nitrogen oxide readings across the city, he said:  The results are shocking, nobody expected this.  The city of Stuttgart, home of Mercedes-Benz and Porsche, is preparing to keep the city free of some vehicles from next year. Between 133,000 and 170,000 vehicles could be affected by a ban in Munich, depending on how strict it will be, the paper said. Cars meeting the latest Euro 6 emission rules would be exempted, it added. While only a niche market in the United States, about half the new cars sold in Germany ran on diesel engines before the VW scandal broke, though diesel market share has since declined. Due to strong diesel demand in their home market, given the technology's fuel efficiency, Germany's three major carmakers have traditionally spent heavily on diesel plants and development. The prospect of diesel bans is seen as weighing on the used vehicle market. Carmakers' leasing and vehicle financing divisions rely on stable used vehicle values because car loans are backed by the value of the underlying vehicle.

The Pacific saw a relatively rapid swing in late October from La Nina conditions - characterised as unusually cold temperatures in the equatorial Pacific Ocean - to neutral or even slightly El Nino-leaning conditions by March. Since then, however, the oceanic and atmospheric signals pointing to a possible El Nino have all weakened. The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) last week downgraded the probability of El Nino conditions being present in the fourth quarter of 2017, to just 36 percent. That is down from 53 percent at the time of its March forecast. (tmsnrt.rs/2snJmB0) The agencyâs central prediction is now that conditions will be neutral in the fourth quarter, with a probability of 53 percent, with only an outlying chance of La Nina, at 11 percent. Sea Temperatures El Nino has a major impact on temperatures and precipitation on countries bordering the Pacific and Indian oceans, and across Latin America, with a smaller impact in some areas of the United States. The phenomenon is typically strongest during the northern hemisphere autumn and winter and weakest during early spring. In winter, El Nino typically brings warmer weather to the U.S. Northwest and cooler, wetter weather to the Southwest and Southeast states. For the purposes of forecasting, meteorologists analyse the surface temperature of the Pacific in a series of boxes stretching from the coast of Peru west along the equator to the international date line and beyond. (tmsnrt.rs/2sXiR2v) The atmospheric and oceanic conditions identified with El Nino and the Southern Oscillation (ENSO) are most closely associated with temperatures in a composite area called Nino region 3.4. Region 3.4 straddles the equator from 5 degrees north to 5 degrees south and stretches from 120 degrees west to 170 degrees west. (âWhy are there so many ENSO indexes, instead of just one?â NOAA, Jan 2015) El Nino is conventionally defined as at least three or sometimes six consecutive months in which the surface temperature in region 3.4 averages 0.5 degrees or more above normal. Surface temperatures in region 3.4 have been rising steadily since October, and are now 0.4 degrees Celsius above the long-term seasonal average, but there are indications they may be peaking. (tmsnrt.rs/2so2JK6) Temperatures further east off the coast of Peru in Nino region 1+2, which stretches from 80 degrees to 90 degrees west, and from the equator to 10 degrees south, have cooled rapidly in the last three months. Surface temperatures in region 1+2 are now 0.1 degrees Celsius below the long-term average, down from 2.6 degrees above the average in mid-March. (tmsnrt.rs/2snQjBZ) Surface temperatures in region 1+2 are usually a good leading indicator for the warmth of water further out in the ocean in region 3.4 given the westward flow of water on the southern equatorial current. (tmsnrt.rs/2rVSdZd) The rapid cooling of water in region 1+2 indicates temperatures in region 3.4 are likely to cool further in the next few weeks, which makes it much less likely a full El Nino episode will develop in the months ahead. Neutral Conditions Other components of ENSO also point to relatively neutral conditions in the near term and mean El Nino will probably not develop before the end of the year. El Nino conditions are normally propagated by an upwelling of warmer than average water from deep down in the ocean off the coast of Peru. But there are currently no signs of warm upwelling. Sub-surface waters off the coast of Peru at depths ranging from about 50 metres to 150 metres are close to the long-term average. The Southern Oscillation, which is the atmospheric counterpart of the El Nino-La Nina cycle, is characterised by variations in atmospheric pressure differentials and wind speeds across the Pacific. El Nino is usually accompanied by a reduction in pressure differentials between the western and eastern sides of the Pacific and a consequent slackening of the trade winds. But both sea-level pressure differences and wind speeds remain close to their long-term averages, according to the latest data. (tmsnrt.rs/2rW82PL and tmsnrt.rs/2snEps1) The conditions for a mutually reinforcing warming of the ocean surface and slackening of the trade winds that characterise a warm episode of ENSO are currently absent.

The Fed is scheduled to release its interest rate decision at 2 p.m EDT (1800 GMT) on Wednesday, with Chair Janet Yellen due to hold a press conference 30 minutes later.                  Higher rates could boost the dollar, making commodities priced in the greenback more expensive for holders of other currencies.       Most people have already priced in a rate hike in June,  said Mark To, head of research at Hong Kong's Wing Fung Financial Group.      What really matters is the anticipation on further action and whether there will be hints on the extent or the schedule of the shrinkage of the balance sheet as well as other monetary policy actions.       The central bank could provide more details on its plans to shrink the mammoth bond portfolio it amassed to nurse the economic recovery.      Gold prices could see a temporary setback, especially with the market currently far underestimating the pace of Fed rate hikes,  Commerzbank said in a note.       Spot gold        was up 0.1 percent at $1,267.05 per ounce by 0806 GMT. On Tuesday, it touched its weakest since June 2 at $1,259.16.     U.S. gold futures         for August delivery were nearly flat at $1,268.90 an ounce.       With geopolitical risk having receded over the last week, gold is now trading on fundamentals and will be ... subject to the nuances of U.S. dollar weakness or strength,  said Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at OANDA.     Meanwhile, the testimony of U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions and his refusal to detail conversations with President Donald Trump was deemed a  non-event  by some market analysts.                   Sessions' testimony did not provide any damaging new information on Trump, but his refusal to discuss conversations with Trump raised fresh questions about whether the White House has something to hide.        In the wider markets, the U.S. dollar remained flat and Asian shares turned mixed on Wednesday as investors everywhere awaited clarity on the Fed's future path.                       Among other precious metals, silver        was flat at $16.86 per ounce. On Tuesday, it hit its lowest since May 19 at $16.68.     Platinum        rose 0.2 percent to $925.25 per ounce but was close to a near one-month low of $918.50 hit on Tuesday. Meanwhile, palladium        fell 0.1 percent to $881.55 per ounce.

Germany's 10-year yield and most other euro zone equivalents were flat on the day, as were U.S. Treasury yields, which have not strayed far from seven-month lows hit in early June. Markets have fully priced the prospect of the Fed raising its benchmark rate to a target range of 1.00 to 1.25 percent, but investors are waiting for any signals on the future path of rates or details on plans to shrink its massive balance sheet. Following a lacklustre first quarter for economic growth and a retreat in headline inflation back to 1.5 percent from 1.8 percent earlier in 2017, there is doubt over whether policymakers can stick to their anticipated pace of tightening of three interest rate rises this year and next. There are also growing doubts on the size and scope of fiscal stimulus the Trump administration may inject into the U.S. economy with campaign promises on tax reform, financial regulation rollbacks and infrastructure spending either still on the drawing board or facing hurdles in Congress.  There is a very large probability of the U.S....ratcheting up the fed funds target range,  DZ Bank's Hendrik Lodde said.  It should therefore be more intriguing to see...whether it is still planning on implementing one further tightening step in the present year... Doubts on this score have surfaced of late.  Few economists polled by Reuters expect major changes in the Fed's quarterly projections for growth, unemployment and inflation which it will also release on Wednesday. Investors will also be looking for a clearer steer on the timing and details of its previously announced plan to reduce this year its $4.2 trillion portfolio of Treasury debt and mortgage-backed securities, most of which were purchased in the wake of the financial crisis to help bolster the economy. German 10-year yields were flat at 0.27 percent on Wednesday, just off a seven-week low 0.244 percent hit in recent sessions. U.S. equivalents were unchanged at 2.21 percent, having struck 2.13 percent - the lowest level since November - earlier this month. The gap between the two benchmarks edged away from a one-month wide of 197 basis points hit in the wake of a European Central Bank meeting last week in which policymakers pledged to maintain ultra-easy policy as inflation remained weak.

Currently, it has a staff of 6,000 globally, a spokesperson said. Largan has four factories in Taiwan and two in China. The company, which reported a net income of about $161.55 million for the three months ended March - a record high for the first quarter, has been seeing growth in sales over the past six months.

Telstra dominates the mobile telephone and broadband industries in Australia but like for many incumbent telecom firms around the world, profits from traditional fixed-line networks have dropped while new rivals move in on mobile market share. The latest round of cuts announced on Wednesday are equivalent to 4 percent of its workforce and bring total headcount reduction since December 2015 to 7.4 percent of staff. More jobs are likely to be shed as the company attempts to transform in to a technology company, said telecommunications analyst Paul Budde, who runs his own consultancy.  It is a clear trend that's taking place and if you compare that to the Googles and the Facebooks and the Skypes of this world, the traditional telecommunications industry is still heavily overpopulated,  he said. Telstra will lose its wholesale business when the new state -owned National Broadband Network (NBN) replaces the company's copper lines by about 2020 - a loss that will hit annual earnings by A$2 billion to A$3 billion ($1.5 billion-$2.3 billion).  The market is getting more competitive, we're also seeing the acceleration of the rollout of the NBN, that's another significant contributing factor, and we're seeing Telstra, as indeed we see with all of our business customers, responding to the impacts of digital disruption,  Telstra Chief Executive Andy Penn told reporters. The cuts are nationwide, will affect most business units and will happen over the next six months, he added. Telstra disappointed the market in February with a surprise profit drop and flagged restructuring costs between A$300 million and A$500 million ($226 million-$377 million) for the 2017 financial year. The latest job cuts are factored into those restructuring costs. The stock has dropped 14.5 percent so far this year, hurt by the weak results and a move by rival TPG Telecom to enter the mobile market. Telstra is seeking growth away from traditional streams by investing in new businesses such as mining, healthcare and cloud computing, but none of these are yet picking up the slack created by traditional revenue declines. Shares in Telstra fell 0.5 percent on Wednesday as the broader S&P;/ASX 200 index climbed 1 percent.

But for the New York Yankees, it could end up being two losses -- one game, and one pitcher. While Eric Young Jr.'s infield single in the bottom of the 11th inning drove home Andrelton Simmons from third base to lift the Angels to a 3-2 victory Tuesday, the Yankees were hit with the prospect of losing the league's best pitcher of the past month, CC Sabathia. Sabathia had won five consecutive starts going into Tuesday's game, but had to leave after the fourth inning because of a strained left hamstring. He has said the key to his success this year was staying healthy. But on his next-to-last pitch of the fourth inning, he felt his hamstring grab. When he made the final pitch of the inning, he knew something was wrong. Yankees manager Joe Girardi said it is likely a disabled list situation, pending an MRI exam on Wednesday.  Yeah, it (stinks),  Sabathia said.  You want to be out there with the guys, you feel bad. It's a tough situation.  It felt like it just grabbed at first. I don't think I heard a pop or anything like that, but when I went to throw the next pitch, I couldn't. It's sore, but hopefully when I wake up tomorrow it will feel a lot better.  Sabathia allowed only one run -- on an RBI single by C.J. Cron in the fourth inning -- and the run was unearned because it came after first baseman Chris Carter dropped a throw from shortstop Didi Gregorius for a two-base error. Instead of being the third out of the inning, Simmons' routine grounder resulted in the Angels getting a runner into scoring position for Cron's single. Related CoveragePreview: Yankees at AngelsNew York Yankees - PlayerWatchLos Angeles Angels - PlayerWatchIt was especially unfortunate for Sabathia and the Yankees because Sabathia hurt his hamstring after Carter's error extended the inning. The Yankees' bullpen, though, was up to the task, at least initially. Giovanny Gallegos (fifth and sixth innings) and Adam Warren (seventh) held the Angels scoreless over the next three innings, allowing New York to take a 2-1 lead into the eighth. Tyler Clippard, however, gave up a home run to Young to start the eighth, tying the game. Young has been a big reason the Angels have been able to keep their heads above water since losing Mike Trout to a thumb injury May 28. Young was called up to replace Trout on the roster and has started every game since, hitting .314 with three homers, nine RBIs and five stolen bases in 15 games, the Angels winning eight of them.  He's a guy getting an opportunity and making the most of it,  Angels manager Mike Scioscia said.  He's getting big hits and playing good defense in center or left and running the bases well. He fits right in with these guys, he's playing baseball.  Simmons got the winning rally started with a leadoff walk off Yankees reliever Chasen Shreve (1-1). After Cron flied out to left for the first out of the inning, Shreve was replaced by Ben Heller, who was called up from the minors earlier in the day. Heller got Martin Maldonado on a grounder back to the mound as Simmons took third, bringing up Cliff Pennington. Pennington had a chance to win the game in the ninth, coming up with two on and two out, but flied out. This time Pennington walked, bringing up Young, who hit a line drive that deflected off Heller and went toward shortstop Gregorius, who had no chance to get the speedy Young.  Keep it as simple as possible and put the barrel on the ball,  Young said of his approach in the 11th.  If you try to do too much, that's when rollovers or pop-up can happen so just line drive swing and I was fortunate enough to hit a line drive up the middle.  Though the Angels won the game in the bottom of the 11th, it's safe to say reliever Keynan Middleton (2-0) had as much to do with the victory for his performance in the top of the inning. The Yankees loaded the bases with one out against Mike Morin before Scioscia summoned Middleton from the bullpen. Middleton got Carter to swing at his first pitch, popping out to third. Middleton also got Brett Gardner on a pop out to third to end the inning.  He got two huge outs for us,  Scioscia said.  He's been pitching a lot, but he says 'I'm good, let's go.'  Angels starter JC Ramirez pitched well for 6 2/3 innings, but got a no-decision after giving up two runs on five hits and three walks. Ramirez also got a boost from reliever Yusmeiro Petit, who rescued Ramirez in the seventh. The Yankees had two on and two out for Aaron Judge, but Petit struck out Judge to end the inning. Chase Headley led the Yankees offense with three hits, including a solo homer in the seventh inning, his fourth of the season, that gave New York a 2-1 lead. Gregorius doubled in the 11th inning to extend his career-best hitting streak to 15 games. NOTES: Angels CF Mike Trout got the stitches out of his hand and has begun throwing a baseball. He also had the cast removed and is wearing a brace. Trout sustained a torn ligament in his left thumb when sliding head first into second base on a steal attempt May 28. He had surgery to repair the tear and is still expected to miss another 4-5 weeks.  I'm starting to strengthen it, just getting the range of motion back,  Trout said Tuesday.  I hear good things from the doctors, they're excited. I'm happy with it, my mind's in the right place.  ... Yankees LHP Aroldis Chapman, on the disabled list since May 14 with a shoulder injury, was scheduled to make a rehab appearance Tuesday with Class A Tampa, but the game was rained out. Chapman is scheduled for an outing Friday with Tampa, and if all goes well, he could be activated Sunday when the Yankees are in Oakland.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-yankees-angels-writethru-idUSMTZED6EIZ4G60"},

Gemfields, which mines for emeralds and amethysts in Zambia and for crimson and pinkish-red coloured ruby and corundum in Mozambique has already received a buyout offer from leading shareholder Pallinghurst Resources Ltd.  Gemfields represents a compelling opportunity to continue to develop a leading gemstone producer with a dominant position in both global emerald and ruby production and a strong consumer brand,  Fosun said. Fosun Gold, part of acquisitive conglomerate Fosun International, said it had proposed buying Gemfields at a price of 40.85 pence per share, a premium of 15.1 percent to Gemfield's closing price of 35.5 pence on Tuesday. Mining group Pallinghurst had offered 38.5 pence per share to buy the remaining 52.91 percent it does not already own. Gemfields had said Pallinghurst's offer  significantly undervalues  the company. Its shares rose 12 percent to 40 pence on Wednesday. Last month, Fosun announced a $887 million strategic investment into Russia's top gold producer Polyus, increasing its exposure to the global natural resources sector. Hong Kong-listed Fosun is also said to be interested in buying oil and gas assets worth about $1.5 billion from Australia's top energy retailer Origin.

The meeting, headed by Glencore's Australian Chief Executive Peter Freyberg, comes five days after Glencore outbid Chinese-owned Yancoal for Coal & Allied Industries Ltd, which operates thermal coal mines in Australia's Hunter Valley.  Glencore's proposal is $100 million higher and fully funded, but Rio Tinto has to give Yancoal the chance to make a counter offer, opening the way for a bidding war. A formal response from Rio Tinto to Glencore's offer could come by the end of the week, the sources said, given Glencore's acceptance deadline of June 26. If Glencore's offer is accepted by Rio Tinto, Yancoal will have five days to respond. Yancoal and Glencore declined to comment. Rio Tinto could not be reached for immediate comment. Freyberg will argue before the Rio Tinto directors, who are meeting this week in Canada, that Glencore's offer provides greater financial certainty than Yancoal's because it intends to fund the acquisition from cash on hand and committed facilities, subject only to regulatory conditions.   Glencore thinks it has the better offer because it's higher and there are may be doubts over Yancoal's funding,  one of the sources said. Yancoal's second-biggest shareholder is struggling commodities trader Noble Group. Yancoal plans a capital raising to help pay forÂ Coal & Allied and Noble would have to invest $260 million in newly issued Yancoal stock to maintain its stake at 13 percent.  This is an element that Glencore will be stressing,  the source said. Fitch Ratings cut Noble's rating on May 26 on concern over its ability to address about $2 billion of debt maturing over the next 12 months. Yancoal said last month it was not concerned at that time over Noble's financial strength. Freyberg is also expected to try and assure Rio Tinto that its bid would not run into hurdles from competition regulators in China and Australia. The bulk of the coal is sold to power companies in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, with little remaining in Australia or sold to China.

The Bank of England (BoE) has highlighted stubbornly low wage growth since the 2008 financial crisis as one reason for keeping UK interest rates low. But the pound's depreciation since last June's Brexit vote has pushed inflation above the Bank's 2 percent target and squeezed the spending power of consumers, who until recently were seen propping up the economy. Economists polled by Reuters expect April's wage growth reading to come in at 2.4 percent - still lagging inflation which came in at 2.7 percent in April and hit 2.9 percent, its highest in nearly four years, in May. At 0738 GMT, sterling was 0.3 percent higher at $1.2783 and 0.2 percent higher at 87.72 pence per euro.  Today's average earnings data are arguably more important for sterling than the headline inflation data,   RBC currency strategist Adam Cole wrote in a note to clients.  Sterling has failed to benefit from upside inflation surprises recently and this was again the case with yesterdayâs May data. We put this down to the negative impact of higher inflation on real wage growth so long as nominal wage growth remains subdued.  Besides a data-heavy week culminating in a BoE interest rate decision on Thursday, investors also awaited a resolution of the political limbo resulting from last week's national election, which produced no clear majority for any party. Prime Minister Theresa May is still in talks with Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) to form a minority government with her Conservative Party, less than a week before the formal start of Britain's negotiations on leaving the European Union. On the subject of Britain's exit talks, May has not departed from her initial position that  no deal would be better than a bad deal  with the EU, but some investors reckon her weakened mandate will leave her less able to pursue a hard negotiating stance. Finance minister Philip Hammond will argue for Britain to stay in the customs union, in a bid to soften Brexit and alter May's approach, the Times reported on Tuesday citing several unnamed sources.  A semblance of stability is helping (sterling) in terms of a minority government with a helping hand from the DUP. While it's not ideal, ultimately it does suggest that we may not be getting another general election so maybe there's a little bit of optimism there,  said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets.

Against the euro and yen, the greenback was roughly steady but it saw solid losses for a second day against the commodity bloc of currencies, all of which have benefited from a surge in expectations of higher Canadian interest rates. Worries about the pace of global growth and weakness in markets for the commodities they produce drove a 5 percent slide in the values of both Australia's and Canada's dollars between March and May. But after comments by Bank of Canada Deputy Governor Carolyn Wilkins on Monday flipped markets towards an earlier rise in borrowing rates there, traders and analysts say bets against the bloc have looked exposed. The loonie is in the middle of its best week since April of last year, up 2.5 percent since last Friday.  There was a stale short of the commodity bloc and the move in the CAD has dragged them higher,  said Stephen Gallo, head of European FX strategy with Bank of Montreal in London. By 0743 GMT in London, the Canadian, New Zealand and Aussie dollars were all a quarter of a percent higher on the day against their U.S. counterpart at respectively C$1.3209, $0.7237 and $0.7558. Added to another cautious recovery for sterling, that left the dollar index 0.04 percent weaker on the day at 96.936. The Fed is scheduled to announce its monetary policy decision at 1800 GMT on Wednesday at the end of a two-day policy meeting, followed by a press conference by U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen. A rise in rates is baked in and may give the dollar only the most minimal of boosts. Any signal that the U.S. central bank is moving towards a reduction in its holdings of more than $4 trillion in Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities might have some more impact. There are also expectations of tweak in the Fed's outlook to reflect a weaker run of data since the start of the year.  People are positioned for a dovish hike,  BMO's Gallo said.  We'll still see rate hikes baked in for the future. But there is a risk that they will send some sort of dovish signal. A median dot comes down, something like that. If Yellen says something about balance sheet reduction, that would be dollar positive.  Fed funds futures on Tuesday suggested traders saw only a 29 percent chance of rates rising to 1.25-1.50 percent at the Fed's Sept. 19-20 meeting, and a 57 percent chance of such a move at its Dec. 12-13 meeting .  What investors want to know most is the pace of rate hikes going forward,  said Ayako Sera, senior market economist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust in Tokyo.  With many market participants worried about a dovish outlook, a surprisingly hawkish one could catch some investors off guard,  she said.  The U.S. economy isn't doing so badly, so anything is possible.

At the end of the day, this can lead to political pressure being exerted on the Eurosystem to maintain the very accommodative monetary policy for longer than appropriate from a price stability standpoint,  Weidmann, who sits on the ECB's rate setting Governing Council said.  After all, in the context of these asset purchases, changes in monetary policy impact more directly on governments' funding costs than interest rate moves,  he added. Fighting stubbornly low inflation, the ECB has kept rates in negative territory for years and deployed a wide range of unconventional tools to stimulate growth and ultimately consumer prices. Weidmann was also critical of a proposal to create a so-called European safe bond, a synthetic instrument that would pool sovereign debt into a new bond, creating a new safe asset that banks could hold to diversify their balance sheets.  But a European Safe Bond created by an official European entity could be perceived as a stepping stone towards full-blown Eurobonds, i.e. mutual liability,  Weidmann said, who has long opposed Eurobonds.  To avoid that perception, European Safe Bonds would have to be constructed by market participants,  he added. The European Systemic Risk Board, headed by ECB President Mario Draghi, has been working on a proposal for such a safe bond but has already come under fire from Germany, which sees the tool as a Eurobond through the back door.

The Paris-based IEA said production outside the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries would grow twice as quickly in 2018 as it will do this year, when OPEC and 11 partner nations have restrained output.  For total non-OPEC production, we expect production to grow by 700,000 bpd this year, but our first outlook for 2018 makes sobering reading for those producers looking to restrain supply,  the IEA said.  In 2018, we expect non-OPEC production to grow by 1.5 million bpd which is slightly more than the expected increase in global demand.  Oil inventories across the world's most industrial nations rose in April by 18.6 million barrels to 3.045 billion barrels, thanks to higher refinery output and imports. The IEA said stocks were 292 million barrels above the five-year average. The agency continued to forecast an implied shortfall in supply relative to demand for the second quarter of this year. But it said slowing demand growth in China and Europe in particular, as well as increasing supply, meant the deficit should narrow to 500,000 bpd from a prior estimate of 700,000. OPEC and 11 rival exporters including Russia have agreed to extend an existing deal to limit supply by 1.8 million bpd to March 2018, in order to cut global inventory levels.  Indeed, based on our current outlook for 2017 and 2018, incorporating the scenario that OPEC countries continue to comply with their output agreement, stocks might not fall to the desired level until close to the expiry of the agreement in March 2018,  the IEA said.

The new tool, called BlockOne IQ, will allow Wall Street firms to use Thomson Reuters data on trading systems that run on Ethereum and Corda, two types of blockchain, the company said. Thomson Reuters, which sells data, news and other information, owns Reuters News. Like competitors including Bloomberg LP and IHS Markit Ltd that provide market data and software to Wall Street, it has been ramping up investments in new technologies like blockchain as customers have started to embrace them. The idea behind BlockOne IQ is to speed up deployment of blockchain in financial markets, Sam Chadwick, Thomson Reutersâ director of strategy in innovation and blockchain, said in an interview. The technology maintains a record of transactions through a network of computers rather than one centralized authority, and was first conceived as a way to trade the digital currency bitcoin. Big banks, investors and other financial institutions have invested millions of dollars in blockchain, hoping that it could make transactions faster, easier and more secure. But it has not yet been used on a wide scale, partly because of a disconnect with technologies that underpin other applications, said Chadwick.  A lot of the financial use-cases rely quite heavily on knowing and including real-world data, but there is really no way to do it,  he said. Tools like BlockOne IQ are known as  oracles  in financial-technology circles, because they allow the two different technologies to communicate with one another.

The recent request is in addition to information Chinese banks must provide for the central bank's quarterly risk assessment, known as MPA. Banks in Shanghai recently received a notice from the People's Bank of China (PBOC) asking them to provide the current size and industry distribution of their loan portfolio and report on how new loans in 2017's first half compared to a year earlier, the two said. The Shanghai office of the PBOC also requested information on any impact the increased regulatory scrutiny has had on new loans, off-balance-sheet assets and the movement of assets from off-balance-sheet to on-balance-sheet, they added. The PBOC was not immediately available for comment. The banks notified include China Development Bank, Postal Savings Bank of China, Bank of Shanghai, Shanghai Pudong Development Bank, Agricultural Bank of China and Bank of China among others, according to the two people. None of the banks responded immediately to a request for comment. Tougher Scrutiny The notice was sent at a time Chinese banks have been preparing for the Macroprudential Assessments (MPA) the central bank conducts for all lenders. China's banks have come under tougher regulatory scrutiny since the beginning of this year after the banking regulator released a slew of requests for self-inspections on matters ranging from credit risk to compliance. Though the tighter regulations have so far mainly been aimed at tamping down speculative activity and riskier forms of lending, many analysts believe they will eventually lead to higher financing costs for companies and drag on economic growth. Fund managers surveyed by BofA Merrill Lynch said Chinese credit tightening ranked as the top  tail risk  for investors in June, for the second straight month (31 percent), with 61 percent of investors saying tighter Chinese monetary policy will slow the economy but have little impact on global growth. According to the people knowledgeable about the PBOC Shanghai notice, it asked banks there whether bond issues have had an impact on credit needs and whether enterprises having difficulties issuing bonds have pivoted to borrowing, the people said. In addition, the PBOC wants to know about the impact policy changes have had on loans to developers and mortgages, the people added.

The move comes about a month after the Indian government gave the central bank greater power to deal with bad loans, including directing banks to initiate an insolvency resolution process in the case of a default under the bankruptcy code. The RBI said the 12 accounts constituted about 25 percent of the overall gross non-performing assets, adding it will direct lenders to begin insolvency proceedings around these accounts.  The committee narrowed the list to 12 by focusing on accounts owing more than 50 billion rupees ($777.2 million), where 60 percent or more of the loan had been already   classified as non-performing by banks as of March 31, 2016. Those 12 accounts were identified based on  objective, non-discretionary criterion  outlined by an internal advisory committee, the RBI said in a statement. The RBI, however, did not provide details about the loans or the banks holding them, which are typically not made public.    The banks have been given six months to finalize resolution plans for other non-performing accounts that do not currently qualify under this criteria.  If no resolution plan is hatched in that period then banks will have to begin insolvency proceedings on these accounts too, RBI said.          Doubts Remain The move marks India's latest attempt to tackle the record 9.64 trillion rupees ($150 billion) in stressed loans as of December, which have choked new credit and hurt economic growth.  Loans classified as non-performing amounted to more than 7 trillion rupees as of March, although final numbers have yet to come.  Sapan Gupta, a lawyer at Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas, called it  a positive and bold step , though some details would need to be worked out, including if a single bank or banks would jointly start the bankruptcy proceedings. Others expected RBI action include changes to guidelines for restructuring of stressed loans.  The intent of the government and the regulator is clear that this needs to be addressed in this financial year,  Gupta said. A senior banker at a large state-run lender declined to give details about the accounts identified by the RBI, saying it comprised  all the known cases  in media reports.   State-run lenders, who dominate India's banking sector, carry the bulk of the soured debt. Meanwhile, loans to sectors like infrastructure, power, iron and steel account for the biggest share of non-performing assets.  But challenges remain, including a largely untested insolvency process. Meanwhile, rating agencies have warned India will need to inject significantly more capital to tackle bad debt and meet upcoming global Basel III banking rules than the 700 billion rupees planned by New Delhi.

Their party, which was defeated in August elections that it said were rigged, called the suspensions unconstitutional. The lawmakers boycotted President Edgar Lungu's address at the official opening of the assembly in March, saying they did not recognize him as leader. A month later, the UPND's leader, Hakainde Hichilema, and five others were arrested and charged with treason after a column of opposition vehicles failed to make way for Lungu's motorcade. Amnesty International has said the treason charges are  trumped up  and called for the politicians' release. On Tuesday, parliament's speaker Patrick Matibini told the opposition lawmakers:  I challenge you to resign on moral grounds if you do not recognize that there is a legitimately elected government.  The suspensions affected 48 of the party's 58 MPs. The remaining 10 had officially excused themselves from attending parliament on the day of Lungu's speech and were not included in the suspension.  Hichilema was moved from a prison in Lusaka to a maximum security facility outside the capital on June 9.

Mohammad Shahedul Islam, the deputy consul general of Bangladesh Consulate General in New York was indicted on Monday on charges of labor trafficking and assault for forcing his domestic helper to work without pay through threats and intimidation.  We have reasons to believe that the arrest is a clear violation of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations 1963. We have lodged a strong protest with the chargÃ© d'affaires of the United States Embassy in Dhaka,  the foreign ministry said in a statement. The ministry on Tuesday summoned a U.S. diplomat to express its dismay over the arrest. Islam has limited diplomatic immunity and was ordered to surrender his passport when he appeared in court in New York, said Queens District Attorney Richard Brown in a statement on Monday. According to the indictment, Islam brought another Bangladeshi, Ruhul Amin, to New York between 2012 and 2013 to work as household help.  Soon after Amin arrived, Islam allegedly took his passport and made him work 18 hours a day, allegedly without pay, according to the indictment.  If the victim disobeyed the defendant's orders, Mr Amin was allegedly physically assaulted,  it said. A spokesman for the Bangladesh embassy in Washington said it believed Amin had filed the case in bad faith and the allegations were  fabricated  and  baseless .Bail was set at $50,000 bond or $25,000 cash. Shameem Ahsan, the Bangladeshi consul general in New York, told Reuters on Wednesday from New York that Islam has been released from a correctional center. Islam was not immediately available for comment. The Bangladeshi embassy in Washington was in contact with the State Department about the prompt resolution of the case, the foreign ministry said.  We hope our concerns will be duly addressed,  it said.     Reporting by Serajul Quadir; Editing by Robert Birsel","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-bangladesh-idUSKBN1950PV"},

Mulberry said like-for-like retail sales were up 1 percent in the 10 weeks to June 3, with UK like-for-like sales up 2 percent. It said the UK continued to benefit from an increase in tourist spending in London, although domestic demand has been softer.

The trial is the first of its kind in the Pacific to explore the capacity, efficiency and effectiveness of drones to get vaccines to otherwise inaccessible areas, said the U.N. children's agency UNICEF, which is supporting the effort.   If the trial shows that vaccine delivery using drones can work, and that it can be integrated into our existing national and provincial systems, then it will change the way we operate forever,  George Taleo, director general of Vanuatu's Ministry of Health, said in a statement.  Vanuatu, a former Anglo-French colony once known as the New Hebrides, is an island nation in the South Pacific. Its estimated population of around 270,000 is spread out across 65 of the country's more than 80 islands.  Located on the Ring of Fire, a horseshoe-shaped band of volcanoes and fault lines circling the edges of the Pacific Ocean, Vanuatu is quake-prone and highly vulnerable to natural disasters, including storms.  In March 2015, a monster cyclone wrecked fisheries, and ravaged crops and livestock, causing damages of an estimated $450 million. Vanuatu is one of the world's poorest nations and a third of its population lacks access to basic services, while violence against women is common.  The Asian Development Bank says 23 babies out of every 1,000 born in Vanuatu die before their first birthday.  We welcome innovative measures to ensure that every child is reached,  said UNICEF Pacific Representative Sheldon Yett.  Ensuring vaccines are consistently available in isolated and remote communities is one of the keys to sustaining high rates of immunization.  The growing availability, improved performance and falling cost of drones offer the opportunity for new applications in challenging environments like Vanuatu, the statement said.  The drone trial will be conducted in three phases through 2018. In December, UNICEF said it was teaming up with Malawi's government to test whether drones could make delivery of aid, including medical supplies, faster and more effective during humanitarian disasters. Other aid agencies have also tried out drones in recent years, but they are not yet being deployed on a large scale for humanitarian purposes.

The pan-European STOXX 600 benchmark and its euro zone counterpart rose 0.4 percent, in line with blue-chips with broad investor focus on the U.S. Fed rate decision later in the day in which the bank is widely expected to raise rates. In the U.K., the FTSE 100 was little changed while midcaps rose 0.6 percent. Hexagon stole the limelight, jumping more than 16 percent to a new record high after a Wall Street Journal report that the Swedish measurement firm was in talks for a potential sale to undisclosed buyers. Technology stocks were the best-performing for the second session running, up 1.3 percent and clawing back after a nosedive fueled by jitters over valuations, particularly in the U.S. Chipmakers Infineon, Dialog Semiconductor and ASML all gained 1.2 to 1.5 percent. British housebuilder Bellway gained ground after its trading update showed robust demand for homes did not slow ahead of a national election on June 8. The builder's upbeat tone also lifted peers Barratt Development and Taylor Wimpey. And Italian banks maintained their strength with Banco BPM was again among top Italian gainers after saying it would repurchase retail bonds from smaller Italian lenders for 123 million euros. Meanwhile Euronext fell to the bottom of the European index after BNP Paribas and Societe Generale sold shares in the firm for 45 euros per share. Euro zone industrial production data later in the day will give investors a steer on the underlying health of the economy, while British wage growth and unemployment figures could add to evidence of a squeeze on Britons' paychecks.

The two are among nine gay and transgender couples planning to get hitched on the cruise heading to Japan in a week-long series of gay pride events in China, where same-sex marriage is illegal and homosexuality frowned upon. The Chinese ceremony is important to Liu because his parents only accepted his sexuality last year, although he has been out of the closet for almost two decades.  It's amazing to have my parents there as witnesses,  said Liu, who traveled to the ceremony on an overnight train from the southern province of Guangzhou.  Over all these years, I have been paving the way to acceptance bit by bit.   The event, held soon after Taiwan legalized same-sex marriage last month, underlines the limits of tolerance for gay rights in mainland China, even though it is growing. [nL3N1J45MX] It is not illegal to be gay in China, although homosexuality was regarded a mental disorder until 2001.  Many big cities now have growing gay scenes, but gay men and women still face family pressure to marry and have children. Bisexual and transgender men and women also face discrimination, although society has become more accepting. Passengers prepare to board a cruise ship at International Cruise Terminal Station in Shanghai, China June 14, 2017.Aly SongTen years ago, when most people were unfamiliar with lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender issues, romance was conducted underground as people could not openly seek out partners, Liu said.  Now it's completely different,  he added.  Many cities have lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community activities.  That does not rid such individuals of government oversight, however, although Beijing vacillates between indifference and intolerance.  Slideshow (3 Images)Last month, police in the northwestern city of Xian briefly detained nine gay activists after they tried to organize a conference, saying the city did not welcome gay people. [nL3N1IX294] Official and mainland Chinese media have adopted a cold attitude to Taiwan's legalization of gay marriage, in contrast to people commenting online, said Liu Hung-En, a law professor at National Chengchi University in Taiwan.  Mainland China is more cautious, it will adopt measures to avoid social conflict,  said Liu.  I believe this is a very serious consideration for officials - stability.  Still, gay clubs and bars are often left alone. [nL3N1J31QR] Many of those waiting on the dock to board the cruise liner  hoped China's tolerance would continue to grow.  Due to our courage to take a stand and progress now, I think gay marriage will be legal in 10 years,  said Liu.

Currently, it has a staff of 6,000 globally, a spokesperson said. Largan has four factories in Taiwan and two in China. The company, which reported a net income of about $161.55 million for the three months ended March - a record high for the first quarter, has been seeing growth in sales over the past six months. It also recently approved plans to pay out a bonus to its employees. Largan is now making moves into the healthcare industry with the establishment of Largan Health Tech this year, Lin said.      Largan has invested T$300 million ($10 million) into Health Tech and holds a 40 percent stake in it, Lin told reporters.      The company has created a medical sleep analysis device, which can track problems like sleep apnea, and is currently hoping to obtain a product license from the Taiwan Food and Drug Administration, which also carries approval from the U.S. FDA, by the end of this year.   On supplying to the auto industry, Lin said Largan remained cautious about deepening its presence in designing and manufacturing lenses used in advanced driver-assistance systems.

Trading was thin, however, as investors awaited a likely U.S. interest rate hike later in the session and debated whether China's central bank would follow with modest tightening of its own, as it did in March. The blue-chip CSI300 index fell 1.3 percent to 3,535.30 points, while the Shanghai Composite Index closed down 0.7 percent at 3,130.67. The Shanghai SE 50 Index, dubbed China's  nifty 50  index, slumped 1.5 percent in its worst day since mid-December, as investors took profits in blue-chips which had far outperformed the broader market in the past months. Investors also dumped stocks - mainly big-caps - that are partly-owned by Anbang Insurance Group, after the acquisitive company said late on Tuesday its chairman Wu Xiaohui was no longer able to fulfil his duties. Hours earlier, Chinese magazine Caijing reported that Wu had been taken away for investigation. Anbang-invested shares - including Financial Street Holdings , China Vanke, China Merchants Shekou , Gemdale and China State Construction Engineering - all dropped sharply. Confidence was further dented by data that showed fixed asset investment grew more slowly than expected in the first five months of the year, while the pace of new construction starts decelerated sharply in May. That weakness, if sustained, suggests a cooling in China's economic growth in coming months, though industrial output and retail sales are holding up better than expected and cushioning a broader slowdown.  Given the recent data, we are almost certain to see a continued slowdown in the second half of 2017 and 2018,  wrote Larry Hu, analyst at Macquarie Capital Ltd.  Reflation has become disinflation. Inventory stocking has turned into destocking. Property is entering a downcycle.  Main sectors fell across the board, led by real estate and banking stocks.

Bahrain's framework provides a virtual space for companies to test their technology-based ideas and is open to existing businesses licensed by the central bank and other local and foreign firms, it said. The testing duration is nine months, with a maximum extension of three months. Other regulators in the region have been fighting to establish themselves as regional powerhouses in fintech, with Abu Dhabi and Dubai both looking to cultivate a financial startup scene.

The completion of the acquisition marked the end of Yahoo as a stand-alone internet company, a tech pioneer once valued at more than $100 billion. Verizon, the No. 1 U.S. wireless operator, is combining Yahoo with AOL, which it bought two years ago, to form a venture called Oath, led by AOL CEO Tim Armstrong. Oath's more than 50 brands include HuffPost, TechCrunch and Tumblr.  Given the inherent changes to my role, Iâll be leaving the company,  Mayer wrote in an email to employees on Tuesday that she also posted on Tumblr.  However, I want all of you to know that Iâm brimming with nostalgia, gratitude, and optimism.  Armstrong told employees in a separate note seen by Reuters that the combined company's services  reach over a billion people each month.  He added that  accomplishing our objectives and goals will require adjustments to the company.  Marissa Mayer, President and CEO of Yahoo, participates in a panel discussion at the 2015 Fortune Global Forum in San Francisco, California, U.S. on November 3, 2015.Elijah NouvelageHe said the  opportunity in front of us is not about the opinions from the pundits and it is not about the competition, it is about our ability to maniacally focus on delivering magical services to mobile enabled consumers.          The closing of the deal, announced in July, had been delayed as the companies assessed the fallout from two data breaches that Yahoo disclosed last year. FILE PHOTO: A combination photo shows Yahoo logo in Rolle, Switzerland (top) in 2012 and a Verizon sign at a retail store in San Diego, California, U.S. In 2016.File Photos/Reuters reported last week that Verizon planned to cut about 2,000 jobs, or 15 percent, of the 14,000 employees at its Yahoo and AOL units. Verizon is expected to make cuts as early as Wednesday. Yahoo cut 15 percent of its workforce last year and AOL cut 500 jobs. On Friday, the remainder of Yahoo not acquired by Verizon will be renamed Altaba Inc, a holding company whose primary assets will be its 15.5 percent stake in Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA.N) and a 35.5 percent holding in Yahoo Japan Corp (4689.T). Thomas McInerney, a Yahoo board member, will become Altaba's chief executive officer. Verizon shares closed down 1.6 percent on Tuesday and are down nearly 13 percent this year.

China's economy grew a faster-than-expected 6.9 percent in the first quarter, well above the government's target of around 6.5 percent for the full year. The IMF said it now expects China's growth to average 6.4 percent from 2018-2020. In April, the fund said it expected 2018 growth to be 6.2 percent.

Administrators were appointed after the private companies of News Corp co-chairman Murdoch and regional TV boss Bruce Gordon declined to extend support for a debt facility past 2017, the network said in a statement. Sydney-based Ten said the unusual move would help it re-negotiate costly content licensing fees with U.S. production studios like CBS Corp, and added that its directors  regret very much that these circumstances have come to pass . Murdoch and Gordon had  agreed to work together exclusively to facilitate the potential formulation, negotiation and implementation of a restructure proposal , they said in a regulatory filing to the Australian Securities Exchange. Murdoch and Gordon, who jointly control about 22 percent of Ten's shares, had not yet agreed on terms of that proposal, it added. Administrators Mark Korda, Jenny Nettleton and Jarrod Villani, from KordaMentha, said in a statement they were  confident that the network is an attractive asset which will find a buyer or will be capitalised . They did not name a potential buyer. Pay-TV company Foxtel, which owns 14 percent of Ten, has long been touted as its most likely buyer, although that would be stopped by current media ownership restrictions. Foxtel declined comment. Broadcasters and Ten in particular have suffered large losses as advertisers follow viewers onto streaming services like Netflix and Amazon.com Inc's Amazon Prime. Ten said it has already agreed, on an informal basis, to new licensing deals with CBS and Twenty-First Century Fox Inc which would halve its future liabilities while still allowing it access to those studios' productions over the medium term. As well as its reality television-heavy programming, the perpetual ratings laggard uses content deals with those U.S. studios to air shows such as NCIS and CSI: Crime Scene Investigation. Ten's predicament adds to pressure on the government to deregulate media ownership and make it easier for traditional media companies to buy each other. Bills to that effect are to be tabled in parliament on Thursday, and face opposition over concerns about diversity in an already concentrated market. A takeover by Murdoch or Gordon may face regulatory hurdles under the country's current media ownership laws.  The Ten Network should be a wake-up call for opponents of media reform,  Federal Communications Minister Mitch Fifield told reporters. Ten said part of Fifield's package, a reduction in television licence fees, would cut overheads. The Australian Securities Exchange suspended Ten shares indefinitely. The stock last traded on Friday at 16 cents, having closed at A$2.56 two years earlier.

In a golfing family from Okinawa, Yusaku and elder brother Kiyoshi had to be content with reflected glory as  Ai-chan  scripted a glittering professional career that included nine LPGA Tour titles and 15 on the domestic circuit.

Big bunches. Even with Jason Vargas on the mound, when small bunches usually suffice. Whit Merrifield hit a bases-loaded triple in a six-run sixth inning and Vargas became the American League's second nine-game winner, leading the Royals to an 8-1 victory over the San Francisco Giants on Tuesday in the opener of a two-game interleague series.  We've been doing some nice things offensively lately,  noted Vargas (9-3), who moved into a tie with Houston's Dallas Keuchel for the AL lead in wins.  We'll try to keep it going as long as possible.  Merrifield and Jorge Bonifacio drove in three runs apiece in a 15-hit attack for the Royals in a matchup of teams that went head-to-head in the 2014 World Series. San Francisco won the 2014 championship, but Tuesday's win improved the Royals' regular-season record against the Giants to 11-4.  Tons of memories,  Vargas said of the Giants' seven-game triumph in 2014.  We came up short. That's the way it goes sometimes. But there's the bonds that you build.  The Royals scored seven of their eight runs off Giants starter Ty Blach (4-4), who had allowed a total of just seven runs in his previous five home starts this season. Related CoveragePreview: Royals at GiantsSan Francisco Giants - PlayerWatch It's a game of inches,  said Giants manager Bruce Bochy, suggesting the game was closer than the final score would indicate.  We're just not quite getting to some of these balls (in the field). I think you've got to attribute bad luck to it for the most part.  In winning for the sixth time in its last nine road games, Kansas City led just 2-1 before busting the contest open with the six-run sixth. Merrifield's three-run triple came after Alcides Escobar's two-run double had increased the Royals' advantage to 4-1.  It was one of those you don't hit very well, but you see it going in a good spot,  Merrifield said of his sliced flyball down the right field line that barely eluded a diving Hunter Pence.  I saw it dying ... That was beautiful.  Bonifacio completed the uprising with an RBI single that scored Merrifield to make it 8-1. The Royals have scored a total of 31 runs on a four-game trip that opened with three games in San Diego. Nineteen of those runs have been the product of four-, six- and nine-run innings. The six-runner Tuesday allowed Vargas to coast. He called it a night after completing seven innings during which he allowed five hits and one run. He walked one and struck out six in his 102-pitch effort. He won his fourth straight decision, having allowed a total of five runs over that stretch.  To have that kind of success and to sustain it this far into the season, is fantastic,  Vargas gushed. Merrifield, Bonifacio, Escobar, Salvador Perez, Mike Moustakas and Alex Gordon had two hits apiece for the Royals, who were visiting San Francisco for the first time since the 2014 World Series. Escobar and Gordon each scored two runs. Along with the seven runs, Blach gave up 10 hits in his 5 2/3 innings. He walked one and struck out four. Buster Posey and Austin Slater had two hits apiece for the Giants, who split a pair with the Royals in Kansas City earlier this season. The Giants have been held to no more than one run on 17 occasions this season. Blach easily could have had a 1-2-3 third inning instead of the two runs allowed on four hits. The Royals loaded the bases on a ground ball by Escobar that barely eluded Giants first baseman Brandon Belt, a blooper by Gordon to short right field that tipped off the glove of second baseman Aaron Hill, and a bunt by Vargas that was placed perfectly between Blach and third baseman Eduardo Nunez. Even Bonifacio's hard-hit, two-run single could have been caught, but Blach's stab at the liner came up empty and the ball rolled into center field, scoring Escobar and Gordon, giving Kansas City a 2-1 lead.  That's just baseball,  Blach lamented.  A couple of bad bounces and then you don't make pitches when you have to ... It's going to humble you in a hurry.  The Giants had opened the scoring an inning earlier on the first of Posey's hits, a leadoff double, followed by Pence's infield out and Brandon Crawford's sacrifice fly. NOTES: Royals 2B Whit Merrifield's triple was the sixth of his two-year career, his first with more than one runner on base. ... Royals LF Alex Gordon's two hits increased his career total to 1,274, allowing him to pass DH Billy Butler for seventh place on the franchise's all-time list. ... Royals manager Ned Yost announced before the game that LHP Matt Strahm will replace LHP Eric Skoglund in the starting rotation, beginning Thursday against the Los Angeles Angels. ... The Golden State Warriors' championship clinched Monday night was their third since moving west, tying the Giants for third place among San Francisco Bay Area professional teams behind the San Francisco 49ers (five) and Oakland Athletics (four). The Giants' three World Series titles in 2010, 2012 and 2014 were all won on the road. ...

Too many games are already broadcast at times which make life difficult for match-going fans, with those having the longest journeys hit especially hard,  FSF said in a statement.  Broadcasters are reliant on the atmosphere generated by supporters which goes a long, long way to creating their attractive TV 'product'.  How do empty stands look? Yet broadcasters and the Premier League seem intent on scheduling games at times which are increasingly difficult for fans to get to.  The organisation also said that BT Sport, one of the league's current broadcasters, were a  driving force  behind the proposal and criticised them for not mentioning it at earlier meetings with the channel denying the claims. The final decision on the new broadcasting deal will be made by the league's governing body in February 2018.

Cash-strapped Mongolia was forced to turn to the International Monetary Fund for support this year following a collapse in foreign investment, declining commodity prices and a downturn in coal demand. But it is now reaping the benefits of a ban on exports from North Korea, which has forced China to find alternative coal suppliers. The value of Mongolia's coal exports rose to $1.01 billion in the first five months of 2017, 4.6-times higher than the same period last year. The rise in exports contributed to a 69.5-percent increase in Mongolia's foreign trade surplus, which hit $1 billion, the country's statistics office said on Tuesday. According to the latest data from China's customs authority, Mongolia became China's second biggest supplier of non-lignite coal in the first four months of this year, with deliveries reaching a total of 11.7 million tonnes, more than double the same period of 2016. The average price of Mongolian coal delivered to China in April stood at $66 a tonne, double the value in April last year, though still much cheaper than the average $122 per tonne for Australian shipments. Mongolia's base metal exports, including copper, also jumped 58.8 year-on-year to $41.3 million over the first five months of 2017. Total exports grew 42 percent to $2.5 billion. Rising fuel costs contributed to a 27.8-percent climb in the value of total imports, with the value of diesel imports growing 2.4 times to $141.5 million and gasoline up 49 percent at $97.9 million. Mongolia's largest copper mine, Oyu Tolgoi, run by Anglo-Australian miner Rio Tinto, saw its revenues rise 5.7 percent year-on-year in the first quarter of the year, citing higher prices and copper concentrate sales.

I desperately wanted him to get that last out, get the shutout,  Padres manager Andy Green admitted Tuesday night after the veteran left-hander fell one pitch short of throwing the third complete-game shutout of his career.  He's earned the right to stay out there, he's earned the trust.  Alas, Richard didn't get the shutout. Cincinnati pinch hitter Tucker Barnhart dropped a two-run double into right on a full-count, two-out pitch in the ninth to end Richard's shutout bid. But Richard and the Padres still emerged as 6-2 winners at Petco Park as rookie Franchy Cordero led a 12-hit attack with two home runs, one game after he hit the first home run of his major league career.  Franchy has had good swings since he got here,  Green said of the 22-year-old center fielder, who is hitting .327 since being promoted from Triple-A El Paso on May 27 as an injury replacement for Manny Margot.  Those two homers tonight were crushed.   I'm making sure pitches are in the zone,  Cordero said.  I'm getting some good pitches to hit.  Related CoveragePreview: Reds at PadresCincinnati Reds - PlayerWatchSan Diego Padres - PlayerWatchEven though Cordero homered twice, the biggest ovations of the night were saved for Richard, who improved to 5-7 while lowering his earned run average to 4.30. Richard cruised through the first six innings, allowing only two hits and three baserunners with one erased on a double play. But he allowed a two-out walk and single in the seventh, and ran into more trouble in the eighth. Jose Peraza and pinch hitter Patrick Kivlehan opened the inning with back-to-back singles. Richard struck out Billy Hamilton and Scooter Gennett before walking Joey Votto on a full-count pitch to load the bases. Adam Duvall then hit a slow roller toward third that Cory Spangenberg charged, bare-handed and threw to first to get Duvall by inches and end the inning with the shutout intact.  Cory's play was awesome,  Richard said.  That was a big-time play.  And Richard came within a strike of getting out of a similar jam in the ninth. After Eugenio Suarez and Scott Schebler singled to open the ninth, Richard struck out Dean Mesoraco and retired Jose Peraza on a flyball to center before Barnhart doubled. Closer Brandon Maurer got the final out.  I really appreciate the opportunity Green gave me,  said Richard, who allowed two runs on eight hits, two walks and a hit batter while striking out six and throwing a season-high 127 pitches in 8 2/3 innings.  We've been using the bullpen a lot. I wanted to go all the way.   When Clayton is down in the zone and ahead, he can go that low and lower,  Reds manager Bryan Price said.  He has that sinker and nice slider. He was able to get ahead with his pitches and didn't get himself in trouble. There wasn't really a whole lot we could do.  Cordero, who hit his first major league homer Monday night against the Reds, connected on solo shots of 420 feet (off Reds starter Scott Feldman) in the third inning and 424 feet (off Tony Cingrani) in the eighth inning. The first homer came on a change, the second on a slider. The Padres' first four hitters singled and San Diego was up 2-0 before Feldman (5-5) recorded an out. Jose Pirela and Cordero opened the Padres first with singles to left. Wil Myers dropped a run-scoring hit into short right to make it 1-0 and Yangervis Solarte grounded a single to center to drive in Cordero with the second run. Feldman righted the ship by getting Hunter Renfroe to ground into a forceout, then got both Spangenberg and Allen Cordoba taking third strikes.  Baseball is a funny game,  Feldman said.  Sometimes you can make great pitches and they have soft contact and they find holes.   They had four singles on seven pitches and two runs in,  Price said.  None of the four was really hit hard, but that's putting the ball in play and making something happen. They were aggressive early in the count.  The Padres upped their lead to 3-0 on Cordero's first homer of the night. It was the 100th home run allowed by Cincinnati pitchers this season. San Diego added a fourth run in the fifth on a one-out single by Solarte, a wild pitch and a two-out bloop single to short center by Spangenberg as Solarte slid home ahead of the throw by Billy Hamilton. Feldman departed after five innings, giving up the four runs on eight hits and two walks with six strikeouts. The Padres added one more run after Cordero's second homer. Austin Hedges singled in the eighth, moved to second on a sacrifice bunt and scored on a single by Pirela. NOTES: Padres LF Alex Dickerson might not play this season because of recurring lower back problems and could be facing surgery. Dickerson has been on the disabled list since spring training.  He's had another setback,  Padres manager Andy Green said.  I'm not optimistic that he plays this year.  Dickerson, who had been working out at extended spring training, was projected to hit fourth or fifth in the Padres' order this season. ... Cincinnati SS Zack Cozart didn't play Tuesday because of a sore quad. ... Injured Padres RHPs Trevor Cahill (shoulder inflammation) and Jered Weaver (hip) are throwing bullpens and could face hitters next week ahead of rehab assignments. ... The Reds are 3-12 against left-handed starting pitchers this season, including 1-7 on the road.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-reds-padres-writethru-idUSMTZED6EIUL74W"},

Governor Haruhiko Kuroda will also dispel market speculation the BOJ is engaging in  stealth tapering  by stressing that the recent slowdown in the bank's bond buying is not intentional and simply the result of a stable bond market, say sources familiar with its thinking.  The slowdown came as a result of our policy of guiding yields at appropriate levels,  BOJ Executive Director Masayoshi Amamiya told parliament on Tuesday, a view seen representing the bank's official line on policy. At the two-day rate review ending on Friday, the BOJ is likely to maintain a pledge to guide short-term interest rates at minus 0.1 percent and the 10-year government bond yield around zero percent under its yield curve control (YCC) policy. Market players are seen focusing on Kuroda's post-meeting briefing at 3:30 p.m. (0630 GMT) for any new insights into what might trigger a future hike in the BOJ's bond yield target. Growing signs of life in Japan's economy have presented a fresh communication challenge for the BOJ, pushing it to be clearer with markets on how it might withdraw its stimulus - without sounding as if such an action is imminent. Kuroda has rebuffed calls from some lawmakers and academics to disclose details on how the bank may exit its ultra-loose policy, arguing that such debate was premature with inflation distant from its 2 percent target. But BOJ policymakers see an increasing need to enhance their communication on a future exit strategy given growing calls for more disclosure.  The BOJ shouldn't be afraid of revising (its exit strategy) in the future and openly debate the subject now, paying heed to market voices,  Akio Negishi, head of Japan's life insurance lobby, said on Friday. A Reuters poll showed economists were divided on whether the BOJ could communicate its exit strategy without causing market turmoil. Jonathan Xiong, head of the Fixed Income Alternatives Group at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, expects YCC to stay for a long period of time as the BOJ has little choice but to act as a backstop when financial markets become volatile.  They are stuck between a rock and a hard place because they can't let (YCC) go, but it's not really having an impact,  Xiong said.  At some point in time, that's going to be challenged - the efficacy of the policy, what impact it is having on the underlying fundamentals,  he said, questioning whether the YCC effect was worth the cost of maintaining a huge balance sheet. After four years of heavy asset buying failed to accelerate inflation, the BOJ revamped its policy framework to one controlling the yield curve from that targeting the pace of money printing. But it maintained a loose pledge to increase its bond holdings at an annual pace of 80 trillion yen ($727 billion) year to appease proponents of heavy money printing on the board. While the BOJ argues it still has plenty of bonds to buy, many analysts expect its bond-buying program to reach a limit with the bank already owning more than 42 percent of the market. Indeed, recent data showed the BOJ's bond buying has slowed considerably in recent months. Analysts expect the BOJ to slow the pace further to around 60 trillion yen by year-end and to omit the 80-trillion-yen pledge from its policy statement.

The FOMC is clouding the dollar sentiment so investors are content sitting on the sidelines and not really doing much today  said Stephen Innes, senior trader at OANDA.     The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, edged down 0.02 percent at 0541 GMT.     Conviction for a move beyond a widely expected rise now has faded for many forecasters along with the outlook for inflation for most, a Reuters poll showed.     Growing doubts about the U.S. administration's ability to pass tax and healthcare reforms through Congress, along with weak U.S. economic data have investors expecting a more dovish outlook, which would mean a greater gain for the Asian currencies, analysts say.     The U.S. May consumer price inflation data is also scheduled to be out on Wednesday morning Washington time.      The CPI data could actually provide significant bounce to the dollar. The CPI data for the last two months have come out negative and this is what really cooled the markets' expectation for a further rate hike beyond June  Innes said.      Among regional currencies, the South Korean won edged up 0.3 percent on Wednesday, recouping losses from its previous session.      Meanwhile, the Taiwan and Singapore dollars  edged lower, down 0.05 percent and 0.03 percent respectively.          CHINESE YUAN      The yuan, which weakened the past two days, edged up 0.06 percent, after a slew of mixed economic data on Wednesday.     China's factory output grew 6.5 percent in May from a year earlier, slightly better than expectations, but fixed-asset investment grew 8.6 percent in the first five months of the year, less than forecast.     After last week's readings from China purchasing managers' index  surveys, Wednesday's data  looks supportive and I think this is going to look pretty decent in the broader picture for the regional sentiment,  Innes added.  I would expect the risk on-sentiment to play positively.            SOUTH KOREAN WON      The won rose after three straight sessions of losses as a bounce in tech stocks on Wall Street took some pressure off following the rout in them.     The Korea SE Electric and Electronics index climbed as much as 1.3 percent during Wednesday trade, but then the gains were erased.

The yield on the benchmark 10-year JGBs stood flat at 0.060 percent while the price of the 10-year JGB futures were down 0.03 point at 150.36. The Bank of Japan bought a total of 750 billion yen ($6.82 billion) of JGBs with 5 to 40 years to maturity on Wednesday, an amount that was in line with market expectations.

Bellway, which posted a 13 percent increase in reservations between February and June and said it expected full-year completions to increase by nearly 10 percent, said the snap election had not dampened consumer interest.  Customer demand for new homes remains strong across all regions and has increased throughout spring, in accordance with the usual seasonal trend, unabated by any uncertainty in the weeks preceding the recent general election,  it said in a statement.

Futures for European bourses likewise pointed to marginal early gains with the Eurostoxx 50 up 0.1 percent. Chinese data showed retail sales and industrial output beat forecasts, but a miss in urban investment reinforced views the world's second-largest economy will start to lose momentum as lending costs rise and the property market cools. The reaction was tepid, with Shanghai stocks easing 0.7 percent. Investors dumped stocks partly-owned by Anbang Insurance Group after the company said its chairman was temporarily unable to fulfill his duties. Moves elsewhere were cautious with MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan up 0.1 percent and Japan's Nikkei down 0.08 percent. Wall Street had been in a more confident mood overnight, with major indexes at closing at record peaks. The Dow rose 0.44 percent, while the S&P; 500 gained 0.45 percent and the Nasdaq 0.73 percent. The S&P; 500 technology sector rebounded 0.9 percent, following its biggest two-day decline in nearly a year. Big tech names, including Microsoft and Facebook , led the index higher. The U.S. central bank is scheduled to release its decision at 1800 GMT on Wednesday with a news conference to follow from Chair Janet Yellen. Investors fully expect a rate rise largely because Fed officials have told them to, so attention will rather be on the outlook for policy and particularly when the central bank might begin to wind down its massive portfolio of U.S. debt.  The main focus will be on the Fed's balance sheet policy,  said Michelle Girard, chief U.S. economist at RBS.  While we expect the formal announcement of a change in its balance sheet policy to be made in September, we do not rule out the possibility that strong guidance regarding the time frame for tapering is delivered sooner.  Beware Hawks While the Fed still has another hike pencilled in for this year, a recent run of soft inflation data has left fund futures implying only a 40 percent chance of a move by December. The market's five-year outlook for inflation has been falling steadily and currently stands at a seven-month trough of 2.18 percent. It had spiked as high as 2.52 percent last November in the wake of President Donald Trump's surprise election victory. This leaves the market vulnerable to any hawkish spin from the Fed, which would likely slug Treasury prices while lifting the embattled U.S. dollar. The currency could do with the help having taken a fresh knock on Tuesday when the head of Canada's central bank put his own hawkish spin on the outlook for rates there. The U.S. dollar fell as far as C$1.3209, its lowest since Feb. 28, having shed two cents in as many days. It also lost ground to sterling after UK inflation data surprised on the high side and amid reports Britain's ruling Conservative Party was likely to sign a deal on Wednesday to form a minority government. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar barely budged at 96.978. It was little changed on the Japanese yen at 110.06 and the euro at $1.1213. In commodity markets, oil slipped after industry data showed a surprise rise in crude stocks and OPEC reported an increase in its production despite its pledge to cut back. Benchmark Brent crude retreated 35 cents to $48.37 a barrel while U.S. light crude shed 42 cents to $46.04.

The purchase is the latest defense deal between Bangkok and Beijing amid warming ties since Thailand's military coup in 2014, when relations cooled with the United States, historically the country's major supplier of Western weapons.  Buying from the West is a little hard â¦ buying from China is better value for money,  General ChalermchaiÂ SitthisartÂ told reporters, announcing that Thailand's cabinet had approved the purchase of the VN-1 carriers. The choice of China was not a consequence of closer relations between the two countries, however, but the most cost-effective option, he added.  The most important is the suitability for the needs of Thailand and the price,  Chalermchai said, adding that Russia and Ukraine had also been in the running to supply the vehicles. In April, Thailand approved the first of three planned submarine purchases from China in a deal worth a total of more than $1 billion. The Thai navy defended the decision following a barrage of public criticism over questions such as the suitability of the submarines and the need to buy the costly craft. Thailand and China have also agreed to cooperate on building an 873-km (542-mile) railway project, as part of Beijing's regional infrastructure drive. Delays and talks over loan terms and land development rights have held up the project, however, prompting Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha to say on Tuesday that he would make use of Article 44, a special security measure, to allow work to begin.

Toyota, the world's No. 2 automaker, wants to apply its smaller partner's expertise in affordable, reliable pint-sized cars to its own passenger models as it grapples with higher costs and stiff global competition to produce increasingly sophisticated cars.  There's a market for compact cars in markets like Brazil,  Daihatsu President Soichiro Okudaira told reporters in Tokyo in comments for publication on Wednesday.  Toyota sells similar models across Asia and South America, and Brazil has been an important market for models like the Corolla, although they were in a slightly larger class.  Okudaira, chief engineer of the last two generations of Toyota's Corolla series, was dispatched from Toyota earlier this month to lead Daihatsu. He declined to offer additional details on when or in what capacity the carmaker would expand in Brazil. Toyota has a market share of about 9 percent in Brazil, where it sells the Etios subcompact hatchback and the Corolla and Camry sedans, along with SUVs and trucks. Any expansion there will see it come up against market leaders FCA, General Motors Co, and Volkswagen AG. Brazil, a top-10 global market for cars, could be a tough market for expansion as a deepening recession and political uncertainty has sapped auto sales in recent years. The country posted total sales of about 2 million in 2016, having fallen sharply from 3.5 million in 2010. Daihatsu is Japan's largest maker of minicars with engines no bigger than 660cc made specifically for the domestic market as a low-cost alternative to passenger cars. Toyota has already enlisted Daihatsu to help develop compact cars for emerging markets including India. Toyota President Akio Toyoda last month said he was betting on minicar technology to simplify the way it manufactures regular cars at lower cost. Toyota has set up in-house companies to specialise in small cars and emerging markets, which are big markets for smaller models. Okudaira said the two companies were still mulling their strategy for India and other emerging markets, including whether to launch compact cars under the Daihatsu or Toyota brands and securing a high-quality supply chain. Toyota has struggled to grow its market share at the affordable end of India's car market, a sector dominated by domestic rival Suzuki Motor Corp.

Ethylene, a flammable gas, is the main feedstock used to synthesize the most commonly used plastics, found in the vast majority of all manufactured goods. It is produced in refineries from natural gas or crude oil, as one of the main products of the $400 billion global petrochemicals industry. When manufacturers buy and sell plastic, a benchmark of the ethylene price is often written into their purchase contracts, to reflect the raw material cost. But the European index is unregulated and, the sources said, has overstated the actual price for the past four years because it does not take into account the now common practice of firms negotiating rebates. The sources include one person at a petrochemical company and three people who research the industry. The actual price companies charge each other for the chemical is secret, and companies tend to offer big clients discounts from the benchmark to reflect economies of scale, local market conditions, or other factors. But those discounts have grown, making the benchmark a less accurate reflection of the real costs. Companies do not have to pass the rebates on to their customers further down the supply chain, who are contractually obliged to pay prices based on the higher benchmark. Reuters was unable to assess the degree to which the practice has hurt manufacturers of goods made from plastics. More than 10 companies that buy or sell ethylene, contacted by Reuters, declined to discuss their pricing, including any rebates they offer or receive. Most of the sources that spoke to Reuters said they did not believe rebates had made the market unfair. But they say the lack of transparency, and the divergence between the published benchmark and the true price, could create the potential for suppliers to overcharge customers who may be unaware of the practice.  There's an understanding that this is not a perfect process,  said Matthew Thoelke, senior director of olefins and derivatives at analysis firm IHS. The sources said the petrochemical companies that participate in setting the ethylene contract price while giving or receiving rebates include Europe's biggest, such as BASF, Royal Dutch Shell, Total and LyondellBasell. BASF, Shell and Total declined to comment on their pricing. LyondellBasell did not respond to Reuters request for comment. Level Playing Field The benchmark for the price of ethylene used in nearly all European contracts is produced by the Independent Chemical Information Service, or ICIS, which has published its  ethylene contract price  since 1980. ICIS is now a unit of Reed Business Information. Thomson Reuters, parent company of Reuters, competes with Reed as a supplier of benchmark prices for other commodities but does not publish a rival index price for ethylene. ICIS senior editor Nel Weddle said the benchmark, published after confirming agreements with at least four companies who buy and sell ethylene, allows everyone to start on a  level playing field  with knowledge of prices. However, the figures it uses to compile the index do not include rebates off the benchmark price. ICIS said it is not responsible for collecting information about such rebates, which it called  a common part of any supply or purchase contract . Although ICIS is the most widely used benchmark in Europe, it is not the only one. A competitor, Argus, publishes a rival index, which also does not take rebates into account. It declined to comment. Another competitor, Platts, has launched a new rival index which it says will better reflect the true market price by taking into account the rebates. The sources familiar with the practice said refineries began offering substantial rebates in 2013 to clear their stocks during a period of oversupply of ethylene. But instead of being a temporary measure to deal with local market conditions, the rebates grew after oil and gas prices tumbled in 2014, and have continued to widen since. The contract price of ethylene has hovered around 850-1,050 euros per tonne over the past year, down from a range of 1,200-1,300 euros before oil and gas prices fell in 2014. Rebates now run at more than 100 euros a tonne, the sources said. One of the sources, at a major research consultancy, said his firm's staff use their own contacts at chemical companies to get a sense of the secret rebates. The rebates are now a key to understanding the profitability of businesses in the sector, which is therefore harder to forecast solely from public data. Weddle of ICIS said the company was not aware of complaints from users of its benchmark about its omission of the rebates. However, last year ICIS conducted a review of its methodology and posted feedback online from some users of the index. One of three respondents whose views ICIS posted wrote that the published prices should begin to reflect rebates.  Otherwise, the reported contract prices do not reflect the real market situation and especially smaller suppliers and consumers are left in the dark,  the respondent wrote. ICIS confirmed that the response was genuine but declined to identify who had written it. Some in the industry who spoke to Reuters sought to play down the significance of the disparity between the index and the price after rebates, saying the market is competitive enough to prevent customers who rely on the benchmark being overcharged. While Europe's benchmarks have their problems,  the situation in general is fair , said Jose Manuel Martinez, the chief executive of the Spanish oil company Cepsa's petrochemicals business. No Regulation Unlike benchmarks for crude oil or the major refined fuel products like diesel and gasoline, the ICIS benchmark for ethylene is not formally scrutinized by regulators, as ethylene contracts are not typically traded on securities exchanges. In the marketing materials for the rival Platts benchmark intended to address the problem by adjusting for rebates, Platts includes a graph comparing the contract price to what it says is its own assessment of the true price, based on the cost of raw materials, economic conditions and other fundamentals. The graph shows the ICIS contract price consistently higher than Platts' estimate from 2013 on, with the gap growing wider last year, when Platts estimates the true cost of ethylene bottomed out as low as 650 euros a tonne. Platts says the early indications from its new index have shown large buyers typically receiving rebates of 14-18 percent. The issue appears mostly confined to Europe, rather than the United States or Asia, which have more liquid markets with higher volumes of spot trade of ethylene, making prices relatively transparent.  As long as a market is liquid, the players know how to behave,  said Cepsa's Martinez. Editing by Peter Graff","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/petrochemicals-companies-idUSL8N1I426E"},

The world's top economy contributed $661 million to Standard Chartered's operating income in 2016, or 5 percent of the total, making it the smallest of its major markets - Hong Kong, China, India, and the United Arab Emirates.   We really view the Americas as a growth area. When I say that, we are not looking to be JPMorgan or BAML (Bank of America Merrill Lynch) or Wells Fargo,  StanChart's Americas CEO Torry Berntsen told Reuters at the bank's New York office.  We think we have a special calling card in terms of what our network looks like.  The plan is to offer StanChart's trade finance, transaction banking, cash management and forex market products to large U.S. firms, senior bankers said. This push comes about five years after StanChart reached a $340 million settlement with U.S. authorities over transactions linked to Iran. The bank is due to stay under supervision until end-2017, although there are concerns this could be extended. Higher interest rates, healthy corporate loan growth, and hopes President Donald Trump's lower taxes and plans for lighter financial regulation would boost banking sector growth provide the right backdrop for expansion.  It's more of a new focus and it is as a result of Bill and Simon coming in ... We think it is a great growth prospect for the bank,  said Berntsen, referring to CEO Bill Winters and former HSBC banker Simon Cooper who joined last year as chief of corporate and institutional banking, the bank's largest unit. Torry Berntsen, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Head of Corporate and Institutional Banking of the Americas region for Standard Chartered Bank, poses in New York City, U.S., June 13, 2017.Shannon StapletonSince joining, Cooper has made changes to turn around the bank that had been hit by losses from bad debts and slowing economic growth in its major markets, including hiring senior external bankers like Berntsen, who came on board in October. StanChart posted its first annual loss in 26 years in 2015.     Cooper has also expanded industrial sector coverage and streamlined the bank's mammoth workforce to get a bigger share of the traditional banking businesses. Slideshow (2 Images)In the last few months, StanChart's senior external hires in the United States included former Morgan Stanley (MS.N) banker Jens Andersen, who has joined the bank as head of its financial markets and trading forex in the Americas.  Internally, it has relocated global head of financial firms Jeremy Amias from Hong Kong as co-head of global banking for Americas, and Singapore-based head of transaction banking for banks Anurag Bajaj as head of transaction banking in Americas. StanChart has traditionally been focused on helping its clients based in Asia, Africa and the Middle East to do business in the United States. It still makes most of its profit in Asia, but is now looking at the other side. The bank's U.S. assets were at $47.6 billion at the end of 2016, accounting for 7 percent of its total, versus 21 percent in Hong Kong and 13 percent in Singapore.  We're not trying to conquer the U.S. market,  CFO Andy Halford told Reuters in a interview in April.   We're saying for those businesses in the U.S. who have or might have interest in the emerging markets but have never heard of us, we should be making ourselves more visible.

Wall Street rose to fresh record highs overnight but Brent oil prices fell back near $48 a barrel. Any major rebound still looks unlikely in Qatar. The index is down 8.4 percent since economic sanctions were imposed by other Gulf states last week.  A rebound in the market will be capped as long as the boycott is in place,  said a Doha-based fund manager. Foreign funds, which have been net sellers since the diplomatic and trade boycott started on Monday last week, have slowed their pace of selling since the start of this week and on Tuesday they accounted for one-quarter of market turnover. Non-Qatari Gulf trades have thinned. Abu-Dhabi listed natural gas explorer Dana Gas may continue to rise on momentum after it soared its 15 percent daily limit on Tuesday as it proposed swapping $700 million of outstanding Islamic bonds for much cheaper instruments. It said it had discovered its current sukuk were  unlawful . Restructuring the sukuk would mean lower future cash outflows, and unlike the existing sukuk the new instruments would not have an equity conversion feature - positive for the stock price. However, an Abu Dhabi-based asset manager said the stock's strong gains were not necessarily justified and the result of the company's legal effort to declare its debt invalid was not yet clear.

Banks in Shanghai recently received a notice from the People's Bank of China (PBOC) asking them to provide the current size and industry distribution of their loan portfolio and report on how new loans in 2017's first half compared to a year earlier, the two people said. The Shanghai office of the PBOC also requested information on any impact the increased regulatory scrutiny has had on new loans, off-balance-sheet assets and the movement of assets from off-balance-sheet to on-balance-sheet, they added. The PBOC was not immediately available for comment. The notice was sent at a time Chinese banks have been preparing for the quarterly Macroprudential Assessments (MPA) that the central bank conducts for all lenders. China's banks have come under tougher regulatory scrutiny since the beginning of this year after the banking regulator released a slew of requests for self-inspections on matters ranging from credit risk to compliance. According to the people knowledgeable about the PBOC Shanghai notice, it asked banks there whether bond issues have had an impact on credit needs and whether enterprises having difficulties issuing bonds have pivoted to borrowing, the people said. In addition, the PBOC wants to know about the impact policy changes have had on loans to developers and mortgages, the people added.

The world's top economy contributed $661 million to Standard Chartered's operating income in 2016, or 5 percent of the total, making it the smallest of its major markets - Hong Kong, China, India, and the United Arab Emirates.   We really view the Americas as a growth area. When I say that, we are not looking to be JPMorgan or BAML (Bank of America Merrill Lynch) or Wells Fargo,  StanChart's Americas CEO Torry Berntsen told Reuters at the bank's New York office.  We think we have a special calling card in terms of what our network looks like.  The plan is to offer StanChart's trade finance, transaction banking, cash management and forex market products to large U.S. firms, senior bankers said. This push comes about five years after StanChart reached a $340 million settlement with U.S. authorities over transactions linked to Iran. The bank is due to stay under supervision until end-2017, although there are concerns this could be extended. Higher interest rates, healthy corporate loan growth, and hopes President Donald Trump's lower taxes and plans for lighter financial regulation would boost banking sector growth provide the right backdrop for expansion.  It's more of a new focus and it is as a result of Bill and Simon coming in ... We think it is a great growth prospect for the bank,  said Berntsen, referring to CEO Bill Winters and former HSBC banker Simon Cooper who joined last year as chief of corporate and institutional banking, the bank's largest unit. Torry Berntsen, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Head of Corporate and Institutional Banking of the Americas region for Standard Chartered Bank, poses in New York City, U.S., June 13, 2017.Shannon StapletonSince joining, Cooper has made changes to turn around the bank that had been hit by losses from bad debts and slowing economic growth in its major markets, including hiring senior external bankers like Berntsen, who came on board in October. StanChart posted its first annual loss in 26 years in 2015.     Cooper has also expanded industrial sector coverage and streamlined the bank's mammoth workforce to get a bigger share of the traditional banking businesses. Slideshow (2 Images)In the last few months, StanChart's senior external hires in the United States included former Morgan Stanley (MS.N) banker Jens Andersen, who has joined the bank as head of its financial markets and trading forex in the Americas.  Internally, it has relocated global head of financial firms Jeremy Amias from Hong Kong as co-head of global banking for Americas, and Singapore-based head of transaction banking for banks Anurag Bajaj as head of transaction banking in Americas. StanChart has traditionally been focused on helping its clients based in Asia, Africa and the Middle East to do business in the United States. It still makes most of its profit in Asia, but is now looking at the other side. The bank's U.S. assets were at $47.6 billion at the end of 2016, accounting for 7 percent of its total, versus 21 percent in Hong Kong and 13 percent in Singapore.  We're not trying to conquer the U.S. market,  CFO Andy Halford told Reuters in a interview in April.   We're saying for those businesses in the U.S. who have or might have interest in the emerging markets but have never heard of us, we should be making ourselves more visible.

The overdue payment letter sent by Sweden's Intrum Justitia turned out to be a mistake by the gym - Vesanto had cancelled her membership - but it was also a window, for her, on an industry that has become familiar to many Europeans. The growing use of debt collection companies in Europe has been a boon for investors in the major firms which have come to dominate the field. Continuing consolidation of the industry has also led regulators to seek to counterbalance their influence. As well as selling debt recovery services to clients such as Vesanto's gym, Intrum and other big European debt collection companies Hoist Finance, also from Sweden, and Italy's Cerved Information Solutions, buy unpaid loans at a discount and recover what they can. They have benefited from the fact that Europe's banks are weighed down by almost a trillion euros of non-performing loans and under pressure from regulators to get those debts off their balance sheets. Shares in Intrum and Hoist have risen by 17 and 30 percent in the last two years respectively. Cerved's share price is up nearly 50 percent over the same period, compared with a 16 percent loss for European banking shares. âSpecialisation works,â said Erik Forsberg, chief financial officer for Intrum Justitia. âWe argue we will always be more efficient than a bank or telco or a utility.  Last month, however, Intrum's share price took a hit after it was forced to row back on its merger plans. In the biggest of a series of tie-ups in the sector, Intrum plans to merge with privately-owned Norwegian firm Lindhoff, creating Europe's largest debt collection company. The European Commission approved the merger on Monday, after Intrum proposed a string of divestments that has sent its share price down 17 percent since May 18. Intrum said they would cut the proposed cost savings of the merger by nearly a third. Also in the regulators' sights is the extent to which the debt collection firms have been able to dictate prices of non-performing loans, to the detriment of Europe's struggling banks. Headwinds Italy's 350 billion euros of bad debt was one of last year's biggest market worries, with the Italian government forced to create a state-backed bail-out fund to tackle rising non-performing loans. In December UniCredit, Italy's biggest lender by assets, estimated that the price of recent deals would allow it to recoup just 23 cents to the euro on its bad loans, far below the 43 cents to the euro average for Italian banks. It then went on to sell a large portion of its bad loan portfolio at just 13 cents to the euro. Nicolas Veron, a senior fellow at Brussels-based think tank Bruegel, said low prices were a market reality and arguably reflected the low value of the loans rather than any fire-sales. But regulators are keen to close the gap between what banks sell their loans for and what the debt collection companies are ready to pay. The European Union is considering plans to strengthen the secondary market for NPLs, which may boost demand and raise their sale prices. On May 24 the European Central Bank said it is encouraging public-private partnerships to improve data quality and recovery processes to reduce asymmetries between buyers and sellers. Veron said he did not think such measures would lift prices that much because their level reflected a tough political and economic climate.  Some of the initiatives are helpful but I don't think they will change the prices you get under current conditions.  The eurozone's bad debts are finally beginning to fall, according to ECB data released in April, but still stand at some 931 billion euros. The three big debt collection companies' net profit margins, meanwhile, have risen, with Intrum at 24.1 percent, Hoist at 19.5 percent and Cerved at 12.9 percent, the first time the company, floated in 2014, has reported a double digit margin. Intrum said in April it saw pricing pressure from increased competition in western Europe in the first quarter of 2017 hitting its margins slightly, arguing that boosting efficiency should compensate over time. Cabot Credit Management, majority owned by U.S. firm Encore Capital, plans to list as early as this year, according to Sky News, joining its UK-listed peer Arrow Global.  We are reviewing our strategic options, but no decisions have been finalised,  a spokesperson for Cabot said. Virginia-based PRA Group is also active in Europe. In the United States, PRA and Encore have fared less well than their European counterparts and their share prices have fallen over the last three years. Some U.S. Supreme Court Justices criticised the business models of debt collectors after a subsidiary of Encore tried to collect a decade-old debt from a woman who filed for bankruptcy in 2014. On May 15, the Supreme Court ruled by majority that the woman could not sue the firm. The debt collectors say their success is not due to heavy-handed practices but rather a sophisticated analysis of borrowers' ability to pay. StepChange, a UK charity that helps people with debt problems, said consolidation and stricter regulation meant conditions in Britain had improved in recent years.  There are larger, more reputable firms operating and the more unsavoury elements have exited the market,  a spokesperson said. But companies should keep the way they do business under constant review, Stepchange said.  There is still some evidence of poor practice, including some clients who report pressure to make unaffordable repayments.

Economists polled by Reuters overwhelmingly see the Fed raising its benchmark rate to a target range of 1.00 percent to 1.25 percent, though expectations for further rate hikes are fading.     The Fed is scheduled to announce its monetary policy decision at 1800 GMT later in the day at the end of a two-day policy meeting, followed by a press conference by Chair Janet Yellen.     The Fed may also provide more clues on how it plans to reduce its holdings of more than $4 trillion in Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities.       There's some spillover from last night's performance of the U.S. stock markets,  said Mikey Macanaig, an analyst with Sunsecurities Inc, adding that he expected the Fed would not raise rates anymore this quarter after the June hike in the light of recent weak economic data.       However, we are still very cautious; we don't want any surprises,  he said.     Meanwhile, data out of China showed retail sales and industrial output topped forecasts in May, but a miss in urban investment reinforced views the world's second-largest economy will soon start to lose some momentum as lending costs rise and the property market cools.     Analysts dismissed the Chinese data as having little effect on the direction of the Southeast Asian stock markets.

Perhaps this is because OPEC is actually shipping more crude. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries prefers to talk about output when assessing the impact of the deal among members and 11 allied countries to reduce production by 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd). While output is no doubt important, for the immediate market impact it's probably better to focus on what the group is actually exporting. Vessel-tracking and port data in Thomson Reuters Eikon shows that for the first five months of 2017, OPEC exported 25.6 million bpd. This figure is only shipments by tanker and is filtered to show vessels that have already discharged, are discharging or are en route to their destination. The shipments for the first five months of this year are slightly higher than the 25.4 million bpd the producer group exported via tankers in the same period in 2016. In May, OPEC shipments were 25.6 million bpd, up from April's 25.02 million bpd, according to the vessel-tracking data. The increase in exports via tanker was also reflected in higher output by the group, which said in a report on Tuesday that it produced 32.14 million bpd in May, up 336,000 bpd from the prior month. The increase was largely because members that are exempt from the output cuts agreed in November, such as Libya and Nigeria, increased production after prior curtailments due to civil unrest. Nonetheless, the increase in output and exports via tanker show the scale of the challenge facing OPEC, and its de facto leader Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest crude exporter. The Saudis are carrying the bulk of the output reductions among OPEC members, and the shipping data suggest they are doing their part by lowering exports as well. In the first five months of 2017 Saudi Arabia exported 7.48 million bpd via tankers, down 440,000 bpd from 7.92 million bpd in the same period in 2016. This reduction in exports is close to the 500,000 bpd output cut pledged by the Saudis in terms of the November agreement, which was extended last month to March 2018. Saudis Stand Alone? The problem for the Saudis is that it appears fellow OPEC members aren't doing as much to help the cause of rebalancing oil markets and therefore boosting prices. It's the sort of situation that's unlikely to persist, with the Saudis likely to demand more compliance from OPEC and the 11 allied producers, including Russia. If the Saudis don't see meaningful reductions in output and exports by its allies, it's likely that they will be forced to scale back the extent of their output and export reductions. The dilemma facing the Saudis is encapsulated by China, the world's largest crude oil importer and the Saudis biggest customer. China imported 12.5 percent more oil in the first four months of this year, but imports from Saudi Arabia rose by a paltry 2.5 percent. In contrast, China's imports from fellow OPEC member Angola jumped 13.3 percent and those from allied producer Russia gained 8.1 percent. This shows that the Saudis are not only surrendering market share in China, they are partly giving it up to countries that are supposed to be joining the kingdom in output cuts. In addition, producers outside the agreement to cut output are gleefully snaring increased market share in China. Imports from Brazil jumped 41.2 percent in the first four months of the year compared to the same period in 2016, making the South American nation China's seventh-largest supplier. While rising from small bases, it's worth noting that China's imports from Britain are up 245 percent and those from the United States 3,886 percent.  Taken together, these two non-traditional suppliers to China accounted for 3 percent of the country's imports in the first four months of the year. That may not sound like a lot, but it equates to about 260,000 bpd in British and U.S. exports to China. The Saudis may well look at that figure and think that they should have supplied that crude to China, but they haven't in the name of rebalancing the market. It's not like the Saudis are enjoying significantly higher prices, with Brent crude ending on Tuesday at $48.72 a barrel, perilously close to the $46.38 close the day before the Nov. 30 deal between OPEC and its allies. It seems the Saudis have given up much to get little in return.

Let's get on the road. We've played some long games on consecutive days,  the rookie said after his long RBI single in the 12th inning gave his Boston Red Sox a 4-3 decision over the Philadelphia Phillies that completed a sweep of the two-game home part of the four-game inter-league  series  between the teams. The game lasted four hours and 24 minutes, making the Red Sox the fourth team in baseball history to play three straight four-hour games. Sunday night, it was 4:06 in a loss to the Detroit Tigers. Monday night, it was 4:16 in an 11-inning win over the Phillies. Then came Tuesday, when the Red Sox made it back-to-back walk-off wins for the first time since July 9 and 10, 2014.  Philadelphia's gotta travel back, too. So if we're going to be tired they're definitely going to be tired,  said Benintendi, who also cut down Howie Kendrick at the plate to prevent the potential go-ahead run in the eighth inning. Related CoveragePreview: Phillies at Red SoxPhiladelphia Phillies - PlayerWatchBoston Red Sox - PlayerWatchBefore Monday, the Red Sox (36-28) had only one walk-off. Now they have three as they handed the last-place Phillies their sixth and seventh straight losses as they fell to 10-33 after an 11-9 start. With one out in the 12th, Xander Bogaerts, who had three hits, was walked by reliever Luis Garcia (1-1). Mitch Moreland, who hit a solo home run in the second inning, singled high off the Green Monster to send Bogaerts to third. Benintendi, who also had a bases-loaded walk and a double, then lined his game-winning hit deep into the right-field corner.  I was just trying to get something to the outfield for the sac fly and got it far enough that it went over their heads,  he said. Fernando Abad (2-0) worked the final two innings for the win as Boston's bullpen turned in five scoreless innings, making it 11 straight scoreless frames in two games.  That group continues to be put with their backs against the wall,  said Red Sox manager John Farrell.  They find a way to get out of jams, they've given us such quality innings, put a lot of zeroes up.  David Price, making his first home start since last week's media blowup, worked the first six innings for Boston, surrendering the tying run in the sixth. He threw only six pitches in the first inning but needed 97 over the next five -- working after not being able to throw between starts because of a blister. The blister was apparently not a problem Tuesday.  The second and third innings, the lack of command in those two innings cost him a high number of pitches, probably cut his night short,  said Farrell.  He's coming off a work week where he was unable to throw his bullpen because of the blister that was there. I thought he got better as the night went along, but uncharacteristic to see the walks (four) he issued.  Phillies starter Ben Lively gave up single runs in each of the first three innings but held the fort from that point. It was his third major league start and he has gone seven innings in each outing.  We played these guys tough,  said Phillies manager Pete Mackanin.  They can't say we were a pushover.  Like the Red Sox, his guys are tired -- and have to go home and play the same team again Wednesday and Thursday.  Yeah, very much,  he said.  It's good to see us play hard against this team in Boston. That's what I was real happy about.  Aaron Altherr hit a two-run homer, while Maikel Franco went 4-for-5 with a walk for the Phillies. He lined two late-inning balls off the Green Monster -- home runs in any other park. He is 7-for-13 in the last three games and had reached base seven straight times before rapping into a hard double-play in the 12th. NOTES: The Phillies traded LHP Joely Rodriguez, who had been designated for assignment, to the Texas Rangers in exchange for a player to be named later or cash. ... Red Sox manager John Farrell said DH Hanley Ramirez will not start either game in Philadelphia. Mitch Moreland will get the starts against two right-handed pitchers. ... Phillies 2B Cesar Hernandez will miss six weeks with a left abdominal strain, manager Pete Mackanin said Tuesday. ... RHP Tyler Thornburg, who has yet to pitch for the Red Sox, has been shut down because of continuing right shoulder woes, while RHP Carson Smith, making his way back from Tommy John surgery, is set to begin a Triple-A rehab this week. ... Phillies RHP Jeremy Hellickson, a former member of the Tampa Bay Rays who has made 14 career starts against the Red Sox, faces Boston rookie LHP Brian Johnson as the four-game  series  shifts to Philadelphia. Hellickson started the season 4-0 in five April starts but has struggled since. He is 4-3 with a 4.41 ERA lifetime against the Red Sox.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-phillies-redsox-writethru-idUSMTZED6EIRE63I"},

Some 1,905 men who were detained at the facility between November 2012 and December 2014 filed legal claims last year against the Australian government and two contractors who ran the camp on PNG's Manus Island. The camp is one of two Australian facilities for processing asylum seekers that have attracted widespread criticism from the United Nations and rights groups because of their harsh conditions and allegations of systemic abuse. Lawyers from the Slater & Gordon firm representing the men said the Australian government and security companies G4S and Broadspectrum, now owned by Ferrovial, would collectively pay the compensation. They said the compensation would be distributed among the former and current detainees according to the length of their detention and the severity of the injuries and illnesses they alleged they had suffered. The government would also pay court costs, the lawyers told a news conference in Melbourne.  The Australian government confirmed the settlement, which it said it entered into to save taxpayers the expense of a costly trial. Immigration Minister Peter Dutton described settling the case as a  prudent  decision. The settlement removes a major impediment to Australia ending its controversial offshore detention scheme, under which would-be asylum seekers who arrive by boat are held indefinitely in the two Pacific detention centers. The other is on the tiny and remote island of Nauru. Australia agreed on a refugee resettlement deal with the United States late last year, under which the bulk of those detained at the two camps would be relocated and Australia in turn would settle refugees from Central America. Asylum-seekers look through a fence at the Manus Island detention centre in Papua New Guinea March 21, 2014.     AAP/Eoin Blackwell/via REUTERSU.S. President Donald Trump has begrudgingly agreed to honor that deal despite earlier calling it  dumb . Australia has said that, once the U.S. resettlement occurs, it will no longer be responsible for the asylum seekers on Manus Island or Nauru.    Many of the claimants awarded the settlement remain on Manus Island, while others have returned home. Majid Kamasaee, the original plaintiff in the case, was one of those who agreed to return to his native Iran. Kamasaee said he voluntarily left Manus Island because he was denied adequate medical care for a serious skin condition.   When I arrived on Manus they confiscated my medicine. Everyday in the harsh sun my skin felt like it was on fire,  Kamasaee said in a statement read out by lawyer Ebony Birchall.  The scars got worse and then developed growths. I was in pain every minute of every day on Manus Island,  he said.

The economists are also divided on the central bank's ability to communicate its exit strategy without causing market turmoil. After three years of massive asset-buying failed to lift inflation, the BOJ switched tactics last year to target long-term interest rates through its buying of Japanese government bonds.   So far, this tactic has also failed to spur inflation to anywhere near the central bank's 2 percent target rate. But with signs of economic improvement, talk is emerging about the central bank's exit strategy - how and when it will start to taper its massive bond-buying and raise interest rates. The central bank faces a tricky balancing act. It must convince markets it has a game plan, but if it reveals too much too quickly, investors could send bond yields sharply higher and destabilize the market. Last week, the head of Japan's life insurance lobby called on the BOJ to begin as soon as possible to openly debate how it will bring ultra-easy monetary policy to an end. Some economists have urged the bank to reveal small parts of its strategy a little at a time to communicate adequately but without spooking markets.  It would have a huge impact on the economy and financial situation if the BOJ shows its exit strategy now,  said Kouki Sakano, analyst at Dogin Regional Research Institute.  The risks are too big for the BOJ to continue its extraordinary monetary easing as its 2 percent inflation target is not realistic. It would be better if the BOJ would indicate 'step' options towards an exit little-by-little - or at least  show the markets that the bank is discussing a strategy.  Fourteen of 35 economists surveyed said the BOJ should disclose its approach at an early stage; 17 economists said the central bank does not need to do so, and four selected  other  in the poll taken from June 6 to June 13.   The BOJ has not illustrated or suggested what it would do or would consider in the course of price rises. The bank should compile and unveil its current thinking to avoid market confusion,  said Mari Iwashita, senior market economist at SMBC Friend Securities, and one of those who advocates early disclosure by the bank. Communication Skills   Analysts were also divided on the BOJ's communication ability. Fourteen of 34 analysts said they were skeptical that the central bank could send messages that would avoid market turmoil when it plans to exit, while 13 said they had no such concerns. The BOJ passed a new milestone this month when its balance sheet topped 500 trillion yen, roughly the same size as that of the U.S. Federal Reserve, having more than tripled since it started aggressive stimulus in 2013. A spike in bond yields, sending prices lower, could leave the bank with big losses on its balance sheet. Also, when the BOJ tightens policy, the bank would have to raise the interest it pays on commercial banks' excess reserves even though it would earn less from the low-yielding government bonds it holds. Nineteen of 35 analysts polled said they were concerned about the chance of a negative impact on the economy from possible losses incurred by the BOJ, while 16 were not. Thirty-one of the 35 economists surveyed believed the BOJ's next major move would be to withdraw from its extraordinary policy. Most said this would be at some time next year or later.  The BOJ is set to keep monetary settings unchanged at the end of its June meeting on Friday and reassure markets it will lag way behind the Federal Reserve in dialing back its massive stimulus program. Analysts also forecast the core consumer prices index, which includes oil products but not fresh foods, will rise to 0.7 percent in the fiscal year to March 2018 and 0.8 percent the following year.  The economy will expand 1.3 percent in the year to March 2018 and 1.1 percent in the next, they project.

Hong Kong shares also dropped, as investors braced for a likely U.S. rate hike later in the day, and awaited clarity on the Federal Reserve's future policy. Some investors also think a U.S. hike will prompt China to increase its interest rates. China's blue-chip CSI300 index fell 1 percent, to 3,545.44 points by the lunch break, while the Shanghai Composite Index lost 0.6 percent, to 3,135.32 points. Investors dumped stocks - many big-caps - that are partly-owned by Anbang, after the acquisitive company said late on Tuesday its chairman Wu Xiaohui was no longer able to fulfil his duties. Hours earlier, Chinese magazine Caijing reported that Wu had been taken away for investigation. Anbang-invested shares - including Financial Street Holdings , China Vanke, China Merchants Shekou , Gemdale and China State Construction Engineering - all dropped sharply. Confidence was further dented by China's tepid investment data for May, reinforcing views that the world's second-largest economy will soon start to lose some momentum.  Given the recent data, we are almost certain to see a continued slowdown in 2H17 and 2018,  wrote Larry Hu, analyst at Macquarie Capital Ltd.  Reflation has become disinflation. Inventory stocking has turned into destocking. Property is entering a downcycle.

So-called special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, seek to fill the gap left by the declining use of master limited partnerships, which historically have helped finance such capital-intensive midstream projects. U.S. crude output is expected to rise 4.5 percent this year and another 7.5 percent in 2018, to about 10 million barrels per day, eclipsing a 47-year-old record. Without hefty infrastructure investments - about $30 billion a year through 2020, according to Tortoise Capital Advisors - that increased flow could face a bottleneck. As the 2015 oil-price decline lowered U.S. output, energy MLPs failed to deliver promised growth and returns, shutting off one key source of investment. Between 2011 and 2014, 60 energy MLPs went public, raising about $23 billion in total proceeds. Since then, only a dozen have done so, according to the MLP Association, a Washington-based trade group. Those offerings raised about $6 billion. SPACs offer a way to do large deals for existing companies whose private-equity owners want to sell or who need cash for expansion. SPACs raise money from institutional and retail investors â who invest without knowing what will be acquired â then go shopping for deals.  Unlike MLPs, SPACs pitch investors on the credentials of their veteran management teams rather than the companies in their portfolios. Investors in SPACs gamble that the executives can find a deal at a suitable price. Rising shale output and falling investments in MLPs have whetted appetites for new financing alternatives to fuel the growth of oil firms.  We think the market is ripe,  said Jim Baker, a partner at Kayne Anderson Capital, which created the first energy-infrastructure SPAC in April. Its SPAC raised $377 million through an initial public offering to hunt for large infrastructure businesses in U.S. shale basins.  There are a lot of private-equity-backed midstream companies that ultimately need to exit and find a long-term home,  said Robert Purgason, chief executive of Kayne Anderson Acquisition Corp, as the SPAC is called.  Purgason is a former executive with pipeline operators  Crosstex Energy and Williams Cos, and he led Chesapeake Midstream Partners through an IPO. At Williams, he ran a business that provided fuels transportation for producers including Anadarko Petroleum, Royal Dutch Shell and Total.  Kayne Anderson Acquisition expects to build its war chest to buy midstream companies to between $1.5 billion and $2 billion through a combination of borrowing and convincing private equity owners to hold stock in any deal. It hopes to have at least one deal in hand before year-end, Purgason said. Earlier SPACs have focused on buying shale producers instead of storage and transportation firms.  Silver Run Acquisition I raised $500 million in early 2016 and months later bought closely-held Centennial Resource Development for about $1.4 billion in cash. That deal's success - investors in the IPO have received a 47 percent return in the last year - spawned several copycats this year. SPACs have an advantage in the current market because of their potential to compete for larger deals than private equity buyers and their ability to use cash and equity.  There are a lot of assets for sale on the midstream side,  said Brian Kessens, a managing director at Tortoise Capital, which specializes in energy investments and MLP-backed mutual funds.  For the larger assets, there aren't a lot of larger buyers.  LOSS OF FAITH IN MLPs Master limited partnerships originally won favor among income-seeking retail investors because they are tax-advantaged partnerships that pay profits to individual owners and aren't required to pay corporate income taxes.  Over time, MLPs are designed to pay the general partner who sets up a business a larger share of its earnings via distributions, similar to dividends, which in turn shrinks the share of future payouts to retail investors. The increasing amount paid to the general partner makes it more difficult to raise money from investors for later-stage projects. That's especially true if the firm's overall earnings do not grow rapidly after the influx of investment.  It gets burdensome five or 10 years out for a growing MLP,  said Greg Reid, president of Salient MLP Complex, a money manager with more than $5 billion in MLP assets. The troubles that some MLPs have faced in growing their businesses has led to a consolidation. Canadian pipeline firm Enbridge Inc, for instance, this year acquired its natural gas MLP, Midcoast Energy Partners LP, after that business struggled to grow in its U.S. Gulf Coast region and its share price tumbled to $8 from $25 in 2014. Michael O'Leary, co-chairman of the corporate securities practice at law firm Andrews Kurth Kenyon LLP, expects consolidation among MLPs to accelerate.  The liquidity available for incremental investment by MLPs just is not there to the same degree as before,  he said. SPACs SEIZE OPPORTUNITY The struggles of MLPs have opened the door for SPACs to finance pipelines, processing plants to separate liquids and storage facilities to hold oil and refined products. A SPAC offers owners - including private equity firms that jumpstart many infrastructure startups - faster liquidity because it has publicly traded shares, said Salient MLP's Reid. An investor can sell shares at any time, unlike those in a private equity fund, who face a lockup period or a gamble on the timing of a future IPO. If Kayne Anderson's SPAC does well, Reid said, his firm would consider putting together a similar company for energy infrastructure deals. A SPAC that has money to spend and is already public has an advantage in the current market for infrastructure deals.   The IPO window is open,  said Reid,  but it's not as easy as it was two or three years ago.

LOUIS -- If Travis Shaw didn't seem terribly enthused about homering and knocking in the go-ahead run with an eighth inning single Tuesday night, it's perfectly understandable. Watching your daughter go through open heart surgery does have a way of putting things in perspective. Shaw's 11th and 12th RBI of the season against the St. Louis Cardinals enabled the Milwaukee Brewers to salvage a split of a day-night doubleheader at Busch Stadium with an 8-5 verdict in the nightcap. Jose Martinez homered twice and drove in three runs in the opener as St. Louis blanked Milwaukee 6-0, winning its fourth straight game. That streak was snapped in the nightcap. Shaw played a significant part in that, putting the Brewers (34-32) ahead in the fourth by following up Jesus Aguilar's solo homer with one of his own for a 3-2 edge. In the eighth, Shaw laced a 3-2 fastball from Trevor Rosenthal (1-3) up the middle to score Domingo Santana from second and snap a 5-5 tie. Related CoverageSt. Louis Cardinals - PlayerWatch My mind is still elsewhere,  Shaw admitted.  It's nice to contribute and help this team, but there are more important things besides baseball. I've been thinking about her a lot.  Shaw missed the team's weekend series in Arizona. Despite his worries about his daughter, Shaw is hitting at an All-Star level, leading Milwaukee in RBI with 44 and tied for fifth in the National League with 17 doubles. It's safe to say that if general manager David Stearns hadn't acquired Shaw from Boston in the offseason as a part of a package for pitcher Tyler Thornburg, the Brewers wouldn't be sitting atop the National League Central.  It's nice to have him back in the lineup,  said center fielder Keon Broxton, who homered and drove in three runs.  He deserved to have this happen tonight.  Milwaukee blew a 5-2 lead before stringing together the winning rally against Rosenthal, who issued consecutive walks to Santana and Aguilar before Shaw and Hernan Perez singled. Closer Seung Hwan Oh relieved Rosenthal with his team losing and promptly allowed an RBI single to Manny Pina. Broxton finished the rally with a sacrifice fly to left fielder Jedd Gyorko, playing the outfield for the first time in the majors.  Not throwing strikes was the big thing,  Rosenthal said. Jared Hughes (2-1) picked up the win for the Brewers despite allowing a game-tying leadoff homer to Matt Carpenter in the bottom of the seventh, his 12th of the year. Corey Knebel got the last three outs for his ninth save in 12 chances. Carpenter went 3-for-5 for the Cardinals (30-33). He doubled and scored in the first on Martinez's fielder's choice, then singled home Greg Garcia an inning later for a 2-0 lead. Broxton's eighth homer pulled Milwaukee within 2-1 in the third. He knocked out St. Louis starter Marco Gonzales in the fourth, ripping a triple to left-center that scored Pina for a 4-2 advantage. Broxton scored on a fielder's choice grounder by Orlando Arcia to make it 5-2, beating Garcia's off-target throw from third. Gonzales lasted 3 1/3 innings, allowing six hits and five runs with no walks and two strikeouts in his first big league game since 2015. He missed last year after undergoing Tommy John surgery. The Cardinals pulled within 5-4 in the sixth. After Eric Fryer's bases-loaded double play ball scored Kolten Wong, pinch-hitter Dexter Fowler delivered an RBI single that knocked off Jimmy Nelson. In 5 2/3 innings, Nelson yielded nine hits and four runs, walking two and whiffing four. He was in line for his first win in nine decisions against St. Louis prior to Carpenter's homer. But the Brewers won anyway, thanks to a rally where they taxed Rosenthal and Oh for a whopping 44 pitches.  Give all those guys credit,  Milwaukee manager Craig Counsell said.  Those were some outstanding at-bats. It's not the biggest numbers we've had offensively this year, but we needed that.  NOTES: St. Louis finally got to make its first choice in the 2017 First-Year Amateur Draft Tuesday, popping CF Scott Hurst of Cal State-Fullerton with the 94th overall pick. The Cardinals lost their first round pick for signing Dexter Fowler in free agency and two other selections to Houston as part of their penalty for  Hackgate.  ... St. Louis C Yadier Molina (lower back stiffness) returned to the lineup for Game 1 of the doubleheader and went 1-for-4. He rested in Game 2, with Eric Fryer getting the call. ... Milwaukee placed RHP Brandon Woodruff (hamstring), who was scratched from his MLB debut in Game 1, on the 10-day DL and recalled RHP Paolo Espino from Triple-A Colorado Springs.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-brewers-cardinals-writethru-idUSMTZED6EIRCI3H"},

","sector":"Markets","content":"(Repeats with no change to text) By Phil Stewart WASHINGTON, June 13 (Reuters) - The United States appears poised to heighten scrutiny of Chinese investment in Silicon Valley to better shield sensitive technologies seen as vital to U.S. national security, current and former U.S. officials tell Reuters. Of particular concern is China's interest in fields such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, which have increasingly attracted Chinese capital in recent years. The worry is that cutting-edge technologies developed in the United States could be used by China to bolster its military capabilities and perhaps even push it ahead in strategic industries. The U.S. government is now looking to strengthen the role of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), the inter-agency committee that reviews foreign acquisitions of U.S. companies on national security grounds. An unreleased Pentagon report, viewed by Reuters, warns that China is skirting U.S. oversight and gaining access to sensitive technology through transactions that currently don't trigger CFIUS review. Such deals would include joint ventures, minority stakes and early-stage investments in start-ups.  We're examining CFIUS to look at the long-term health and security of the U.S. economy, given China's predatory practices  in technology, said a Trump administration official, who was not authorized to speak publicly. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis weighed into the debate on Tuesday, calling CFIUS  outdated  and telling a Senate hearing:  It needs to be updated to deal with today's situation.  CFIUS is headed by the Treasury Department and includes nine permanent members including representatives from the departments of Defense, Justice, Homeland Security, Commerce, State and Energy. The CFIUS panel is so secretive it normally does not comment after it makes a decision on a deal. Under former President Barack Obama, CFIUS stopped a series of attempted Chinese acquisitions of high-end chip makers. Senator John Cornyn, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, is now drafting legislation that would give CFIUS far more power to block some technology investments, a Cornyn aide said.  Artificial intelligence is one of many leading-edge technologies that China seeks and that has potential military applications,  said the Cornyn aide, who declined to be identified.  These technologies are so new that our export control system has not yet figured out how to cover them, which is part of the reason they are slipping through the gaps in the existing safeguards,  the aide said. The legislation would require CFIUS to heighten scrutiny of buyers hailing from nations identified as potential threats to national security. CFIUS would maintain the list, the aide said, without specifying who would create it. Cornyn's legislation would not single out specific technologies that would be subject to CFIUS scrutiny. But it would provide a mechanism for the Pentagon to lead that identification effort, with input from the U.S. technology sector, the Commerce Department, and the Energy Department, the aide said. James Lewis, an expert on military technology at the Center for Security and International Studies, said the U.S. government is playing catch-up.  The Chinese have found a way around our protections, our safeguards, on technology transfer in foreign investment. And they're using it to pull ahead of us, both economically and militarily,  Lewis said.  I think that's a big deal.  But some industry experts warn that stronger U.S. regulations may not succeed in halting technology transfer and might trigger retaliation by China, with economic repercussions for the United States. China made the United States the top destination for its foreign direct investment in 2016, with $45.6 billion in completed acquisitions and greenfield investments, according to the Rhodium Group, a research firm. Investment from January to May 2017 totaled $22 billion, which represented a 100 percent increase against the same period last year, it said.  There will be a significant pushback from the technology industry  if legislation is overly aggressive, Rhodium Group economist Thilo Hanemann said. Ai's Role in Drone Warfare Concerns about Chinese inroads into advanced technology come as the U.S. military looks to incorporate elements of artificial intelligence and machine learning into its drone program. Project Maven, as the effort is known, aims to provide some relief to military analysts who are part of the war against Islamic State. These analysts currently spend long hours staring at big screens reviewing video feeds from drones as part of the hunt for insurgents in places like Iraq and Afghanistan. The Pentagon is trying to develop algorithms that would sort through the material and alert analysts to important finds, according to Air Force Lieutenant General John N.T.  Jack  Shanahan, director for defense intelligence for warfighting support.  A lot of times these things are flying around(and)... there's nothing in the scene that's of interest,  he told Reuters. Shanahan said his team is currently trying to teach the system to recognize objects such as trucks and buildings, identify people and, eventually, detect changes in patterns of daily life that could signal significant developments.  We'll start small, show some wins,  he said. A Pentagon official said the U.S. government is requesting to spend around $30 million on the effort in 2018. Similar image recognition technology is being developed commercially by firms in Silicon Valley, which could be adapted by adversaries for military reasons. Shanahan said he' not surprised that Chinese firms are making investments there.  They know what they're targeting,  he said. Research firm CB Insights says it has tracked 29 investors from mainland China investing in U.S. artificial intelligence companies since the start of 2012. The risks extend beyond technology transfer.  When the Chinese make an investment in an early stage company developing advanced technology, there is an opportunity cost to the U.S. since that company is potentially off-limits for purposes of working with (the Department of Defense),  the report said. Chinese Investment China has made no secret of its ambition to become a major player in artificial intelligence, including through foreign acquisitions. Chinese search engine giant Baidu Inc launched an AI lab in March with China's state planner, the National Development and Reform Commission. In just one recent example, Baidu Inc agreed in April to acquire U.S. computer vision firm xPerception, which makes vision perception software and hardware with applications in robotics and virtual reality.  China is investing massively in this space,  said Peter Singer, an expert on robotic warfare at the New America Foundation. The draft Pentagon report cautioned that one of the factors hindering U.S. government regulation is that many Chinese investments fall short of outright acquisitions that can trigger a CFIUS review. Export controls were not designed to govern early-stage technology. It recommended that the Pentagon develop a critical technologies list and restrict Chinese investments on that list. It also proposed enhancing counterintelligence efforts. The report also signaled the need for measures that fall beyond the scope of the U.S. military. Those include altering immigration policy to allow Chinese graduate students the ability to stay in the United States after completing their studies, instead of taking their know-how back to China. Venky Ganesan, managing director at Menlo Futures, concurs about the need to keep the best and brightest in the United States.  The single biggest thing we can do is staple a green card to their diploma so that they stay here and build the technologies here â not go back to their countries and compete against us,  Ganesan said.

That is beginning to change.        S&P; Global has begun to quiz states, cities and towns about their cyber defenses, and some credit analysts are starting to factor cyber security when they look at bonds. Moody's Investors Service is also trying to figure out how to best evaluate cyber risk. The shift follows a particularly steep rise in ransomware attacks, when criminals hold an entity's computer system hostage until a small ransom is paid. The number of global ransomware detections rose 36 percent in 2016 from the year before, to 463,841, with the United States most heavily affected, according to cyber security firm Symantec Corp. Such attacks, which have also hit companies and federal entities, have spared no kind of municipal issuer large or small, from police departments to school districts and transit agencies. Ransomware attacks on state and local governments and their agencies have risen in proportion with the overall increase, according to cyber insurance provider Beazley Group.  State and local governments are a huge target, quite frankly an easy target for bad guys,  said Bob Anderson, managing director for information security at Navigant management consulting firm in Washington and a former global cyber investigator at the Federal Bureau of Investigation.  Last month's  WannaCry  ransomware attack, which hobbled global businesses and Britain's National Health Service, may also be prompting renewed focus on cyber security, though it had minimal impact in the United States. Considering a potential cyber attack as a similar risk to a natural disaster, S&P; has already been reviewing cyber security defenses of utilities, hospitals and colleges because they were early public sector targets for hackers. Now it is also beginning to ask cities and states about the costs and level of security measures and the financial impact of successful attacks, said Geoffrey Buswick, who manages S&P;'s public sector ratings.  Head in the Sand The answers feed into broader categories that affect an issuer's ratings, particularly governance, liquidity and operations. FILE PHOTO: An advertisement about the Microsoft Cybercrime Center plays behind a window reflecting a nearby building at the Microsoft office in Cambridge, Massachusetts, U.S. May 15, 2017.Brian Snyder/File PhotoMany breaches are handled quickly and financial damage is limited, but not every attack will necessarily end that way, Buswick said.  We're trying to get sense of who has their head in the sand and who doesn't.  Fitch Ratings said it does not consider cyber security in its ratings, and many investors still are not concerned enough to ask for details.  In part, that is because it can be difficult to assess the operational and financial fallout of such attacks. Some high profile breaches so far have also done limited damage to issuers' finances. Case in point is the state of South Carolina, which in August 2012 suffered possibly the worst cyber attack yet of any city or state.  FILE PHOTO: A man types on a computer keyboard in this illustration picture taken February 28, 2013.Kacper Pempel/File PhotoWhen hackers stole the personal data of more than 3.5 million taxpayers, the state had to investigate, provide credit monitoring and consumer fraud protection, and implement a slew of post-breach upgrades, according to State Senator Thomas Alexander. The total cost is around $76 million and counting, he said. That is enough to pay for several school programs combined. But against South Carolina's annual general fund budget of roughly $8 billion, the costs made no dent in its standing as a borrower. Many issuers do not disclose any information to potential investors in bond documents about cyber risks or defenses. But a few, particularly hospitals and utilities, have started doing so. In a February prospectus, the Maryland Health and Higher Educational Facilities Authority, the state's largest public debt issuer, included nearly a full page devoted to the growing risk of cyber attacks.  Because we're such a large issuer, and because healthcare is often treated much more like a corporate credit, the legal counsels to the transaction weigh in on the bondholder risk section,  said Annette Anselmi, the authority's Executive Director, noting that such disclosures also evolve depending on what kinds of questions the market is asking. Hospitals are also ahead on cyber security disclosure because they rely on huge amounts of data, said Court Street Group analyst Joseph Krist. Eventually, he expects others to follow suit.  We went through this with getting munis to ... disclose more pension information. Those were frankly long and painful processes. It just has to get to a critical mass.

So-called special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, seek to fill the gap left by the declining use of master limited partnerships, which historically have helped finance such capital-intensive midstream projects. U.S. crude output is expected to rise 4.5 percent this year and another 7.5 percent in 2018, to about 10 million barrels per day, eclipsing a 47-year-old record. Without hefty infrastructure investments - about $30 billion a year through 2020, according to Tortoise Capital Advisors - that increased flow could face a bottleneck. As the 2015 oil-price decline lowered U.S. output, energy MLPs failed to deliver promised growth and returns, shutting off one key source of investment. Between 2011 and 2014, 60 energy MLPs went public, raising about $23 billion in total proceeds. Since then, only a dozen have done so, according to the MLP Association, a Washington-based trade group. Those offerings raised about $6 billion. SPACs offer a way to do large deals for existing companies whose private-equity owners want to sell or who need cash for expansion. SPACs raise money from institutional and retail investors â who invest without knowing what will be acquired â then go shopping for deals.  Unlike MLPs, SPACs pitch investors on the credentials of their veteran management teams rather than the companies in their portfolios. Investors in SPACs gamble that the executives can find a deal at a suitable price. Rising shale output and falling investments in MLPs have whetted appetites for new financing alternatives to fuel the growth of oil firms.  We think the market is ripe,  said Jim Baker, a partner at Kayne Anderson Capital, which created the first energy-infrastructure SPAC in April. Its SPAC raised $377 million through an initial public offering to hunt for large infrastructure businesses in U.S. shale basins.  There are a lot of private-equity-backed midstream companies that ultimately need to exit and find a long-term home,  said Robert Purgason, chief executive of Kayne Anderson Acquisition Corp, as the SPAC is called.  Purgason is a former executive with pipeline operators  Crosstex Energy and Williams Cos, and he led Chesapeake Midstream Partners through an IPO. At Williams, he ran a business that provided fuels transportation for producers including Anadarko Petroleum, Royal Dutch Shell and Total.  Kayne Anderson Acquisition expects to build its war chest to buy midstream companies to between $1.5 billion and $2 billion through a combination of borrowing and convincing private equity owners to hold stock in any deal. It hopes to have at least one deal in hand before year-end, Purgason said. Earlier SPACs have focused on buying shale producers instead of storage and transportation firms.  Silver Run Acquisition I raised $500 million in early 2016 and months later bought closely-held Centennial Resource Development for about $1.4 billion in cash. That deal's success - investors in the IPO have received a 47 percent return in the last year - spawned several copycats this year. SPACs have an advantage in the current market because of their potential to compete for larger deals than private equity buyers and their ability to use cash and equity.  There are a lot of assets for sale on the midstream side,  said Brian Kessens, a managing director at Tortoise Capital, which specializes in energy investments and MLP-backed mutual funds.  For the larger assets, there aren't a lot of larger buyers.  LOSS OF FAITH IN MLPs Master limited partnerships originally won favor among income-seeking retail investors because they are tax-advantaged partnerships that pay profits to individual owners and aren't required to pay corporate income taxes.  Over time, MLPs are designed to pay the general partner who sets up a business a larger share of its earnings via distributions, similar to dividends, which in turn shrinks the share of future payouts to retail investors. The increasing amount paid to the general partner makes it more difficult to raise money from investors for later-stage projects. That's especially true if the firm's overall earnings do not grow rapidly after the influx of investment.  It gets burdensome five or 10 years out for a growing MLP,  said Greg Reid, president of Salient MLP Complex, a money manager with more than $5 billion in MLP assets. The troubles that some MLPs have faced in growing their businesses has led to a consolidation. Canadian pipeline firm Enbridge Inc, for instance, this year acquired its natural gas MLP, Midcoast Energy Partners LP, after that business struggled to grow in its U.S. Gulf Coast region and its share price tumbled to $8 from $25 in 2014. Michael O'Leary, co-chairman of the corporate securities practice at law firm Andrews Kurth Kenyon LLP, expects consolidation among MLPs to accelerate.  The liquidity available for incremental investment by MLPs just is not there to the same degree as before,  he said. SPACs SEIZE OPPORTUNITY The struggles of MLPs have opened the door for SPACs to finance pipelines, processing plants to separate liquids and storage facilities to hold oil and refined products. A SPAC offers owners - including private equity firms that jumpstart many infrastructure startups - faster liquidity because it has publicly traded shares, said Salient MLP's Reid. An investor can sell shares at any time, unlike those in a private equity fund, who face a lockup period or a gamble on the timing of a future IPO. If Kayne Anderson's SPAC does well, Reid said, his firm would consider putting together a similar company for energy infrastructure deals. A SPAC that has money to spend and is already public has an advantage in the current market for infrastructure deals.   The IPO window is open,  said Reid,  but it's not as easy as it was two or three years ago.

The Los Angeles Dodgers rookie was 3-for-4, with a double, two home runs and four RBIs, as the Dodgers won their fifth game in a row, beating the Cleveland Indians 7-5 at Progressive Field. In his last three games, Bellinger is 6-for-12, with five home runs and eight RBIs.  For a young player to impact a championship-caliber team like this, he's exceeded our expectations,  Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said.  And the best part is he's going to continue to get better.  Leading off the eighth inning, Bellinger broke a 2-2 tie by blasting a 2-1 pitch from Andrew Miller over the right field wall for his 16th home run. It's the first home run Miller has given up this season.  I left it in a spot where he can hit it pretty well. He's a hot hitter with a pretty good approach right now,  Miller said.  He's got nasty stuff,  Bellinger said.  You've got to try not to do too much. He hung a slider, and I got it.  Related CoveragePreview: Dodgers at IndiansIn the ninth, Bellinger walloped a three-run homer, his 17th, off Boone Logan. Both of the homers by the left-handed hitting Bellinger came off left-handed pitchers.  He's not intimidated by anything,  Roberts said.  Every time he gets in the box I feel like he's going to get a hit.  Miller (3-1) took the loss, his first loss in 53 appearances for Cleveland, since he was acquired in a trade from the Yankees on July 31 of last year. Miller had been 7-0 since joining the Indians. Indians manager Terry Francona became ill in the eighth inning and had to leave the dugout. He was replaced by bench coach Brad Mills. There was no further information on the condition of Francona, who did not meet with reporters after the game. Clayton Kershaw (9-2) pitched seven innings, allowing two runs on six hits, with four strikeouts and two walks. Like Roberts, Kershaw is impressed by Bellinger, who is the first Dodgers player to hit two home runs in back-to-back games since Adrian Beltre did it in August of 2004. Bellinger is also only the third Dodgers rookie to have four multi-homer games in a season. Mike Piazza had five such games in 1993 and Corey Seager had four games in 2016.  He gets what this is all about,  Kershaw said of Bellinger.  He's confident, but humble. When he steps into the box, he tries to do damage, and he's been doing it.  Cleveland starter Trevor Bauer pitched 5 2/3 innings, allowing two runs on six hits, with five strikeouts and three walks. The Indians scored three runs in the ninth on a three-run home run by Daniel Robertson off reliever Chris Hatcher. Kenley Jansen relieved Hatcher and picked up his 12th save by striking out Jason Kipnis to end the game. The Dodgers struck first, scoring two runs in the second inning. Chris Taylor led off with a single. Bauer retired the next two batters, but Yasil Puig hit a 1-1 pitch over the wall in center field for his 10th home run, giving Los Angeles a 2-0 lead. The Indians got a run back in the third inning, which began with Robertson hitting a double into the left-field corner. Kipnis and Francisco Lindor both grounded out, but Michael Brantley lined a single to right field, scoring Robertson, cutting the Dodgers lead to 2-1. Cleveland tied it in the fifth inning when Roberto Perez led off the inning by lining his first home run of the year into the left-field bleachers, a drive estimated at 430 feet.  It was not a great night for me. My fastball command was erratic,  Kershaw said.  I think every hit I gave up was on my fastball. I usually don't fall behind (in the count) using my fastball, but it happened a lot tonight.  Manager Dave Roberts said Kershaw was still good enough.  It's a credit to him that when he doesn't have his best stuff he was still able to keep us in the game,  Roberts said. NOTES: The Indians will bring up RHP Mike Clevinger and LHP Ryan Merritt from Triple-A Columbus to start the two games of their doubleheader Saturday in Minnesota. ...

That he is doing so against the Rangers' biggest rival only enhances the reveling in his production. Odor homered in consecutive plate appearances in the seventh and eighth innings and the Texas Rangers rallied from an early two-run deficit to defeat the slumping Houston Astros 4-2 on Tuesday night at Minute Maid Park. Odor went 3-for-4, his third multi-hit game of Texas' six-game road trip, with three RBIs and his 10th and 11th home runs this season. He pulled Texas (32-32) even with his leadoff shot in the seventh, lining a first-pitch changeup from Astros right-hander Chris Devenski into the first row of seats in right field. With two outs in the eighth, Odor followed a single by Jonathan Lucroy with a two-run, opposite-field homer off Astros right-hander Luke Gregerson (2-2). Odor was also instrumental in the lone run Texas scored off Astros starter Brad Peacock. Related CoveragePreview: Rangers at AstrosTexas Rangers - PlayerWatchHouston Astros - PlayerWatch Odor's got power to any field, and those were pitches he could handle,  Astros manager A.J. Hinch said.  A good piece of hitting on both of them, and he beat our guys. It's going to happen.  George Springer and Carlos Correa clubbed their 18th and 12th home runs in the first and fourth innings, respectively, for the Astros (44-22), whose offense stalled immediately thereafter. Rangers starter Nick Martinez induced nine groundball outs over six solid innings before Texas right-handed relievers Jose Leclerc (1-1), Keone Kela and Matt Bush combined to keep Houston at bay.  I was pounding the zone and trying not to be too cute with any of my pitches,  Martinez said.  They got a couple of home runs off me, but we were able to keep it close and our guys were able to rally behind me.  The Astros have lost six of eight games since their 11-game winning streak. What was a promising start for Peacock did not yield the desired result of an individual victory. For the fourth time in his five starts since joining the rotation on May 22, Peacock failed to work the five innings needed to qualify for the win. By the close of the third, he appeared to be cruising, posting seven strikeouts while sidestepping a pair of walks. He added two more strikeouts in the fifth to run his total to a season-high 10, but Peacock also surrendered his first hit, a leadoff single by Lucroy, and then a second single from Odor. Correa complicated matters by playing a sure out at second base into a bases-loaded jam for Peacock when he attempted to beat Odor to second base on a Jurickson Profar grounder up the middle. By eschewing the flip to Jose Altuve, who was covering the bag, Correa failed to record even one out. Two batters later, Peacock walked Shin-Soo Choo to force home Lucroy and halve the deficit.  That's why we run hard down the line. That's why you respect the 90 feet,  Rangers manager Jeff Banister said.  The one thing we challenge our guys with is to get off the bag when you're the back runner, get yourself in position and beat the play to second base. Roogie is a good runner, plus runner, so a ton of credit. You've got to credit Profar for getting down the line, too.  Right-hander Will Harris entered and put out the fire, but Peacock was done after 4 2/3 innings, having allowed one earned run on two hits and four walks.  I've got to figure out how to get through the fifth inning,  Peacock said.  I felt great and felt like I didn't do anything different, but they got to me in the fifth so hats off to them.

You're never really thinking about a home run, you're trying to get a good at-bat together,  said the Chicago White Sox third baseman of his first career grand slam on Tuesday.  (But) that one felt pretty good, I knew it when I hit it.  Left-hander Derek Holland allowed one run over six innings while Davidson's grand slam gave the White Sox a decisive lead en route to a 6-1 victory over the Baltimore Orioles at Guaranteed Rate Field. The win was the second straight for Chicago (28-35). Baltimore (31-32) dropped its sixth in a row and eighth in 10 games in a frustrating run that has seen the Orioles drop to fourth place in the AL East.  We'll bounce back,  Orioles manager Buck Showalter said.  It's never as good as it seems and it's never as bad as it seems. ...

The thing that's frustrating is the walks -- a leadoff walk and then a two-out walk. That's something all of us as starters have been working on.  Baltimore right-hander Alec Asher (2-5) took the loss. Chicago led 2-1 heading into a decisive sixth inning. Asher allowed a leadoff single to Jose Abreu, hit Avisail Garcia with a pitch and walked Todd Frazier to load the bases with none out. That set the stage for Davidson, who clubbed his team-leading 12th homer on a 3-2 pitch to left for Chicago's first grand slam of the season and a five-run White Sox lead.  You see the successful hitters, they don't swing on bad counts,  he said.  I'm trying to learn from them and from all the guys on our team and stay in the zone. When I stay in the zone I do pretty well.  Asher was relieved after the homer. He allowed six runs on six hits, walked two and struck out one over five-plus innings. Abreu went 3-for-4 with two runs scored to pace an eight-hit White Sox attack. Baltimore took a 1-0 lead in the first inning as Joey Rickard led off with a double to left, reached third on a sacrifice and came home on Manny Machado's one-out single to left. Machado was tagged out at second as he tried to extend the hit to a double.  Manny hit a ball and tried to push it (and was) barely out at second,  Showalter said.  We had some good at-bats there, some good at-bats to set up those situation, too. But we couldn't finish it off with another good at-bat.  Asher retired the first seven batters he faced before walking Willy Garcia with one out in the third. The White Sox then hit Asher for two runs in the fourth. Melky Cabrera got Chicago's first hit when he led off with a single to deep center and reached second on Abreu's base hit to center. Both scored on Garcia's double to left center for a 2-1 White Sox lead. The Orioles swept the White Sox in three early May games in Baltimore and take on host Chicago in four games this week.

Some 1,905 men who were detained at the facility between November 2012 and December 2014 filed legal claims last year against the Australian government and two contractors who ran the camp on PNG's Manus Island. The camp is one of two Australian facilities for processing asylum seekers that have attracted widespread criticism from the United Nations and rights groups because of their harsh conditions and allegations of systemic abuse. Lawyers from the Slater & Gordon firm representing the men said the Australian government and security companies G4S and Broadspectrum, now owned by Ferrovial, would collectively pay the compensation. They said the compensation would be distributed among the former and current detainees according to the length of their detention and the severity of the injuries and illnesses they alleged they had suffered. The government would also pay court costs, the lawyers told a news conference in Melbourne.  The Australian government confirmed the settlement, which it said it entered into to save taxpayers the expense of a costly trial. Immigration Minister Peter Dutton described settling the case as a  prudent  decision. The settlement removes a major impediment to Australia ending its controversial offshore detention scheme, under which would-be asylum seekers who arrive by boat are held indefinitely in the two Pacific detention centers. The other is on the tiny and remote island of Nauru. Australia agreed on a refugee resettlement deal with the United States late last year, under which the bulk of those detained at the two camps would be relocated and Australia in turn would settle refugees from Central America.

AAP/Eoin Blackwell/via REUTERSU.S. President Donald Trump has begrudgingly agreed to honor that deal despite earlier calling it  dumb . Australia has said that, once the U.S. resettlement occurs, it will no longer be responsible for the asylum seekers on Manus Island or Nauru.    Many of the claimants awarded the settlement remain on Manus Island, while others have returned home. Majid Kamasaee, the original plaintiff in the case, was one of those who agreed to return to his native Iran. Kamasaee said he voluntarily left Manus Island because he was denied adequate medical care for a serious skin condition.   When I arrived on Manus they confiscated my medicine. Everyday in the harsh sun my skin felt like it was on fire,  Kamasaee said in a statement read out by lawyer Ebony Birchall.  The scars got worse and then developed growths. I was in pain every minute of every day on Manus Island,  he said.

Peralta slammed an opposite-field home run to left on the first pitch of the ninth inning for his sixth home run of the season Tuesday night to rescue Arizona after it blew a 6-0 lead and give the Diamondbacks a 7-6 victory over the Detroit Tigers, who lost for the fifth time in seven games.  I know that he's probably a little disappointed with a ball or two that got away from him in right field,  Arizona manager Torey Lovullo said.  But he separated things. He came back, left on left, he pounded the ball off a very, very quality reliever to the opposite field in this stadium. That says something.  Peralta dove for, and barely missed, a double by Miguel Cabrera while Detroit was scoring six unearned runs in the sixth to erase a 6-0 deficit. He was trying to avoid a collision with center fielder Reynold Fuentes in that instance. Cabrera also lined a tough-but-catchable double off Peralta's glove as he went toward the right-field foul line in the seventh. Justin Wilson (2-2) threw a fat first-pitch fastball that Peralta skipped off the top of the bullpen clubhouse in left center to rescue the Diamondbacks and give them 40 wins on the season. Archie Bradley (2-1) pitched a scoreless eighth for the Diamondbacks and one-time Tiger Fernando Rodney recorded his 17th save by pitching the ninth. Related CoveragePreview: Diamondbacks at Tigers That's what these guys do,  Lovullo said.  They find ways to win games. Although it was a really frustrating sixth inning, we rebounded. We caught our breath and we came up big and we won the game. That's all I'm focusing on.  We enjoyed what was going on for the first 5 1/2 innings. We unfortunately didn't make some plays defensively -- and we knew it. It took the air out of our sail a little bit and kind of gave them a second breath.  The D-backs almost scored a go-ahead run in the eighth. Tigers reliever Alex Wilson gave up a double, a walk and a single to load the bases with nobody out before pinch-hitter Chris Herrmann grounded into a 3-2-3 double play, and Gregor Blanco flied out to right center. The six runs Detroit scored in the sixth to square the score 6-6 were unearned. Zack Greinke was cruising with a two-hit shutout through five, but Ian Kinsler singled leading off the sixth and scored from there when second baseman Brandon Drury, who had four hits, threw wildly past second into left field in a hasty try for a double play on Alex Avila's grounder. Avila reached second on the play and then scored Detroit's second run on an RBI double to right center by Miguel Cabrera. J.D. Martinez cranked his 11th home run in 29 games, a two-run drive to deep left that made it 6-4. Reliever J.J. Hoover replaced Greinke and gave up singles to Nicholas Castellanos, Alex Presley and Jose Iglesias that produced two more runs and tied the score.  Our mindset was that we've got to get runners on,  Castellanos said.  Keep the line moving. He definitely had the game under control until the sixth inning.  I think it was the third time through the lineup and we were starting to feel more comfortable. Some of our ground balls found some holes.  As an inning goes along and you keep things going, the pressure starts moving slowly to the pitcher.  Paul Goldschmidt and Drury, who also had an RBI single, each hit two-run home runs in the third inning for Arizona. Buck Farmer's 13-inning scoreless streak for his first two starts and appearances of the season for Detroit lasted just five batters into the first inning. It ended on a squeeze bunt RBI single to the left side by Chris Owings. Farmer served up Goldschmidt's 15th home run, a drive to deep left, after Peralta singled to open the third. Chris Lamb doubled, and one out later Drury chased the Tigers' starter with his eighth home run of the season and third in three games. Farmer gave up nine hits in 2 1/3 innings, struck out four and didn't walk a batter. Greinke walked two and struck out four in 5 2/3 innings. A strikeout-throwout double play negated a leadoff single against Farmer in the first but four straight base hits gave the Diamondbacks a 2-0 lead in the first inning. Drury's RBI single drove in the second run and was the first of his four hits and three RBIs. NOTES: Detroit RHP Michael Fulmer had an MRI on his sore right shoulder last Friday, followed by a cortisone shot to calm down bursitis.  He's locked in to start Saturday,  manager Brad Ausmus said. His regular turn would have been Wednesday. ... Arizona will take RHP Taijuan Walker (right hand blister) off the disabled list so he can start Wednesday in Detroit. ...

Worries over the potential bursting of price bubbles in China's biggest cities have led to a flurry of government cooling measures in recent months as buyer demand appeared to be more resilient than expected.  The growth rate of new construction starts measured by floor area, a telling indicator of developer confidence and correspondingly volatile, almost halved to 5.2 percent in May from April's 10.1 percent on a yearly basis, suggesting a sharp slowdown in the commencement of new projects, a Reuters calculation showed.  Meanwhile growth in property investment, which mainly focuses on residential real estate but also includes commercial and office space, eased to 7.2 percent in May from a year earlier, versus 9.6 percent in April, Reuters calculated from the National Bureau of Statistics' data. Investors, banned from the hottest markets, are increasingly looking inland, driving up prices in more remote, smaller cities with fewer buying restrictions, leading to a surprise pick-up in May sales.   The area of property sold grew 10.2 percent in May, compared with a 7.7 percent increase in April, reflecting a quickening in  destocking of existing homes in smaller cities, a Reuters' calculation showed. Inventory floor area in the first five months dropped at a quicker pace of 8.5 percent, compared to a fall of 7.2 percent in the January-to-April period.  It's been very obvious in the past two months that the buying demand has spilled over to the third- and fourth-tier cities,  said Joe Zhou, head of research for China at real-estate agent Jones Lang Lasalle (JLL). But such forces are unlikely to offset the fast-cooling market in bigger cities in the longer term, as regulators continued to intensify the crackdown on speculators with more measures to close loopholes. Sales in the top tier cities have dropped about 50 percent from the same period a year ago, property analysts say.  In May, China issued draft new rules for property sales and leasing, requiring developers to promptly publish accurate price information for new homes on sale, barring them from charging various additional fees, hoarding unsold homes or spreading false information about rising prices. Some cities have also announced more stringent measures such as introducing price caps on new units and setting a holding period before reselling a property is permitted.

Global concerns about China have resurfaced since Moody's Investors Service downgraded its credit ratings last month, saying it expects the country's financial strength will erode in coming years as growth slows and debt continues to rise.         But most analysts predict only a gradual loss of momentum in coming months, especially as the government is keen to maintain economic and financial market stability ahead of a major political leadership reshuffle in autumn. May data released on Wednesday appeared to reinforce that consensus view, with still solid factory output and retail sales, and only a slight slowdown in fixed asset investment. However, property investment and construction showed a much sharper deceleration after a slew of government cooling measures in recent months. Factory output rose 6.5 percent in May from a year earlier, statistics bureau data showed on Wednesday.    Related CoverageChina May property investment eases, construction starts dip sharplyAnalysts polled by Reuters had predicted factory output would grow 6.3 percent in May, easing slightly from 6.5 percent in April. But, for now, manufacturing activity still appeared to be well supported by a year-long construction boom fueled by a government infrastructure spree and a heated property market. Sales of excavating machines doubled in May from a year earlier, according to an industry website. Fixed-asset investment growth slowed to 8.6 percent in the first five months of the year. It had been expected to slip to 8.8 percent from 8.9 percent in Jan-April. Growth of private investment slowed slightly to 6.8 percent in January-May period from 6.9 percent in the first four months, the National Bureau of Statistics said, suggesting a slight weakening of the private sector's appetite to invest as small- and medium-sized private firms still face challenges in accessing financing. Private investment accounts for about 60 percent of overall investment in China. Retail sales were more upbeat, rising 10.7 percent in May from a year earlier, unchanged from April and above analysts' expectations for a 10.6 percent rise due to slowing auto sales. China's vehicle sales in May posted their first back-to-back drop since 2015 after the government rolled back a tax incentive that had boosted car sales and output last year. Outlook for 2018 More Worrisome? Despite expectations the economy will lose some steam later this year, most economists believe Beijing should still easily meet its full-year growth target of 6.5 percent, coasting along after an unexpectedly strong first quarter. But some China watchers are more worried about the risks of sharp slowdown next year. A fund manager survey released by BofA Merrill Lynch this week found Chinese credit tightening ranked as the top tail risk for global investors in June for the second straight month, with nearly two-thirds of respondents saying tighter monetary policy will slow activity in the country but have little impact on global growth. Early warning indicators of a financial crisis are already flashing red, economists at Nomura said in a note this week, echoing the warnings of others such as the Bank for International Settlements (BIS).  Enjoy the party but stay close to the door,  said Nomura, predicting growth will slow sharply to 6.2 percent in 2018 and adding there could be a greater risk of financial turmoil.

Perhaps it was Eddie Rosario's three-homer performance. Maybe it was Eduardo Escobar's five-hit night. Or it could be the fact that the Twins combined for a franchise-record 28 hits. All of that amounted to a record-setting night for Minnesota and a big victory for the Twins in a 20-7 rout of Seattle.  It's obviously a special night for your hitters,  said Twins manager Paul Molitor.  It was spread out pretty well, but obviously a nice response to a tough start to the homestand last night.  Rosario's three home runs as the No. 9 hitter and Escobar's five singles gave Twins starter Kyle Gibson plenty of run support. Rosario homered in back-to-back innings to pace Minnesota's offensive outburst. Minnesota scored seven runs in the third and seventh innings. The Twins also scored four in the second. The Twins collected eight consecutive hits in the third inning. Eight Twins recorded multiple-hit games with Escobar, Kennys Vargas and Jason Castro also finishing with four hits.

Related CoveragePreview: Mariners at TwinsSeattle Mariners - PlayerWatchMinnesota Twins - PlayerWatchMariners right-hander Christian Bergman didn't last three innings in Tuesday's start. The Twins chased Bergman (3-4) with two outs in the third after he allowed nine runs on 10 hits. Bergman gave up two runs (one earned) in his previous start, which also came against Minnesota.  Rough night for Bergie,  said Mariners manager Scott Servais.  A lot of balls up middle of the plate on a night where the ball was carrying very well in this ballpark.  Gibson (4-4) allowed six runs and 12 hits in six-plus innings. He wasn't nearly as sharp as his last outing -- also against the Mariners -- in which he held Seattle to one run in six innings. Regardless, Gibson earned his third straight victory. Minnesota's 20 runs were most the Twins have scored this year and helped snap a five-game home losing streak. The two teams combined for a Target Field record 42 hits.  It feels great,  Rosario said.  When everybody's hitting good and your team wins, everything is happy.  Seattle was on the wrong side of history in another category as the 28 hits allowed were the most in Mariners franchise history. The 20 runs were the most Seattle's pitchers have allowed this year.  Obviously the close games are the tough ones, but every loss is a little bit hard to swallow,  Mariners catcher Mike Zunino said.  Hopefully this one we can just sort of write it off and come back ready to pitch and play tomorrow.  With the game out of hand in the eighth, Mariners catcher Carlos Ruiz made his first appearance as a pitcher. Ruiz, who hit 82 mph on the radar gun, gave up a run on two hits. His outing came one game after Twins catcher Chris Gimenez pitched in mop-up duty for Minnesota. After leading 2-0 early, Seattle's lead grew to 3-0 when Jarrod Dyson hammered the first pitch he saw from Gibson over the fence in right-center field. It was Dyson's third homer of the year, a new career high for Dyson. Minnesota used the long ball to respond in the second. Max Kepler put the Twins on the board with a solo shot to lead off the inning. Vargas and Escobar followed by reaching base, and Vargas scored from third on a chopper to the pitcher that Bergman threw to first instead of home plate. Rosario put his club ahead in the second inning on a first-pitch offering from Bergman, which Rosario hit 436 feet into the second deck in right-center field. That gave Gibson a 4-3 lead. The Twins used a big third inning to take the lead for good, scoring seven runs against Bergman and reliever Casey Lawrence to take an 8-3 lead. Vargas' RBI single kept the lineup moving, while Escobar and Castro also drove in runs in the third. An RBI single by Jorge Polanco chased Bergman. Rosario homered again in the third inning, his second in as many at-bats. Each homer came on the first pitch, and the second put Minnesota up 11-3. Given an eight-run lead, Gibson gave a few runs back in the fourth. Dyson, Zunino and Ben Gamel all doubled to make it 11-5. Castro's two-run single capped Minnesota's seventh inning and made it 19-6. NOTES: Twins closer Glen Perkins threw a simulated inning Tuesday in Fort Myers, Fla.

He was originally not expected to return to action until after the end of June, although that timetable could be pushed back a bit. ...

For now, it means one thing.  I'm old,  Lester said with a grin Tuesday night, when he tossed seven strong innings to became the eighth active pitcher to reach 150 wins as the Cubs routed the New York Mets, 14-3, at Citi Field.  I don't like to talk about personal stuff -- I always try to put it off until I'm done, see where I'm at, reflect,  the 33-year-old Lester said.  When it's all said and done, well go home and sit on the couch and reflect on the whole deal, see where we're at.  Eventually, Lester had to admit he liked being in a select group with Bartolo Colon, CC Sabathia, John Lackey, Justin Verlander, Zack Greinke, Felix Hernandez and Jered Weaver.  Well that's pretty cool -- I could probably name most of those guys,  said Lester, who did in fact identify the other seven members of the 150-win club.  That's really good company. But at the same time, we've got a long way to go.  With three seasons plus an option remaining on his Cubs contract, manager Joe Maddon figures Tuesday night's milestone won't be the last one Lester reaches.  He definitely has 200 within his sights,  Maddon said.  Just speaks for his consistency.  Related CoveragePreview: Cubs at MetsChicago Cubs - PlayerWatchNew York Mets - PlayerWatchLester's 150th win was among the easiest of his career thanks to a seven-run second inning in which the Cubs scored all their runs with two outs. Lester, who entered Tuesday with a .066 career batting average, jump-started the rally with an opposite-field two-out single off Mets starter Zack Wheeler. Albert Almora Jr. and Anthony Rizzo followed by drawing walks, with Rizzo's forcing home Willson Contreras, before Ian Happ crushed a grand slam to left field.  Probably the one guy he had to get out was Lester,  Mets manager Terry Collins said.  He couldn't get him out and that changed the whole outcome of the game.  Kris Bryant and Jason Heyward singled before Addison Russell, who lined out to start the second, laced a two-run double to extend the Cubs' lead to 8-1 and finally chase Wheeler.  A seven-run second will always help your pitcher,  Lester said. Lester (4-4) allowed one run -- in the first inning -- on five hits and one walk while striking out 10. He retired 11 in a row between the third and the seventh before stranding runners at the corners in the seventh.  He was kind of effortless tonight,  Maddon said.  He was not over-amped. He was making good pitches, really frugal. Really nicely done.  The Cubs added a run in the third, when Rizzo laced an RBI double, before scoring five more runs on a trio of homers -- a two-run shot by Heyward in the sixth, a solo blast by Bryant in the seventh and a two-run round-tripper by Javier Baez in the ninth. Rizzo, making his first major league start out of the leadoff spot, homered on Wheeler's second pitch of the game and finished 2-for-4.  I told the guys 'If I hit a single, I'm stealing first pitch,'  Rizzo said with a grin. Maddon didn't hesitate when asked if Rizzo would bat leadoff in Wednesday's series finale.  Yeah,  Maddon said, dragging the word out so it was two syllables long. Almora had three hits for the Cubs (32-32), who tied a season high for runs scored and margin of victory. Yoenis Cespedes went 2-for-2 with an RBI double in the first for the Mets (29-34), who received back-to-back solo homers from Neil Walker and Lucas Duda in the ninth. Wheeler (3-4) allowed a career-high eight runs on six hits and three walks while striking out three over 1 2/3 innings -- his shortest start as a big leaguer. He entered Tuesday having allowed just eight runs over his last four starts, a span of 24 1/3 innings.  I just didn't feel it tonight,  Wheeler said.  That's unfortunate. I put us in a hole early.

But in a statement accompanying the New York-based campaign group's report, Jane Buchanan, HRW's associate Europe and Central Asia director, said:  Construction workers on World Cup stadiums face exploitation and abuse, and FIFA has not yet shown that it can effectively monitor, prevent, and remedy these issues.  FIFA said that  while incompliances with relevant labor standards continue to be found â something to be expected in a project of this scale - the overall message of exploitation on the construction sites portrayed by HRW does not correspond with FIFA's assessment . A spokesperson said this assessment was based on quarterly inspections conducted by independent experts and trade union representatives. FIFA also said that it was Russian authorities who  ultimately have the responsibility to protect human and labor rights on their territory and ensure that construction companies are held accountable .

Coal output rose to 297.8 million tonnes in May, the National Bureau of Statistics data showed, slightly above April's 295 million tonnes. For the year to date, coal production has risen 4.3 percent to 1.4 billion tonnes. Unusually hot weather at the start of summer has helped spur demand for coal, while miners have enjoyed more relaxed regulations on production. May's production jump was the fastest in at least two years, according to Reuters data. Strong Chinese demand has helped push up international thermal coal prices. Prompt coal prices for cargoes from Australia's Newcastle export terminal, which are seen as Asia's benchmark, have shot up 18 percent since mid-May to $84 per tonne. China's domestic thermal coal prices have risen more than 16 percent this year, reaching record highs on Wednesday of 570.6 yuan ($83.94) per tonne. Open interest also hit a record on Tuesday, reflecting bullish sentiment. Inventory at Qinhuangdao port, China's largest coal transportation hub, fell to 5.3 million tonnes by June 12, down from 6 million tonnes month ago.

Supported by a three-run homer by Logan Morrison and a four-hit game that included a homer by Corey Dickerson, Faria allowed one run in 6 1/3 innings Tuesday night in the Tampa Bay Rays' 8-1 victory over the Toronto Blue Jays. Faria has a 1.42 ERA.  Jake Faria did it again,  Rays manager Kevin Cash said.  Just an outstanding effort by him. It's a pretty challenging lineup to go face and he quieted a really good lineup. He had a really good fastball to change-up. I think the breaking ball had a little more depth than his first outing so that played a big part, especially against some of the righties. Strong performance on his part.  The 23-year-old beat the Chicago White Sox in his major league debut last week, also allowing one run in 6 1/3 innings.  I thought he did a nice job,  Blue Jays manager John Gibbons said.  He threw everything over the plate. It looked like he had a little deception, nice little breaking ball, he could move the ball all around.  Taylor Featherston also homered for the Rays (35-32), who took the opener of the two-game set. The Rays lead the season series 6-5 against the Blue Jays (31-33) with eight games left. Faria (2-0) allowed six hits and one walk, and he struck out eight. Related CoveragePreview: Rays at Blue JaysTampa Bay Rays - PlayerWatchBlue Jays starter Marco Estrada (4-5) allowed 12 hits, including two home runs, and six runs in 3 1/3 innings.  I'm not making pitches I guess,  Estrada said.  I don't know. It doesn't make any sense. I made some decent pitches and they were hit.  It was the third straight loss for Estrada.  I've been in a bit of a funk the last few outings and it's all going to change because I feel good out there,  he said.  I felt really good out there today and it didn't work out. It (stinks) when you feel good out there and you kind of let one get away from you. I went through a bit of a funk last year and was able to correct it.  Dickerson hit his 15th homer of the season to lead off the ninth against Aaron Loup. Evan Longoria had two hits and two RBIs for Tampa Bay. The Rays, who scored four runs in the third and two in the fourth, added to their lead in the seventh against Toronto reliever Jeff Beliveau. Longoria walked, took third on a single by Morrison and scored on a sacrifice fly by Colby Rasmus, who had two hits to extend his hit streak to five games. Daniel Robertson and Mallex Smith of the Rays also increased their respective hit streaks to five games each with singles. Toronto's Russell Martin ended a 0-for-17 slump with a one-out double in the seventh and scored on the second single of the game by Ezequiel Carrera.  I think it was a matter of locating early,  Faria said.  Later in the game, I started falling behind some hitters and that's when they started having more solid contact. Just getting ahead early in counts and letting everything play after that was really what was working.  Austin Pruitt replaced Faria and retired the final two batters of the seventh inning and escaped a bases-loaded situation in the eighth after allowing two singles and a walk. Pruitt also pitched a perfect ninth. Featherston led off the third inning with his first home run of the season, a drive to right center on a full count. Dickerson and Longoria singled with one out in the third before Morrison hit a blast to center for his 18th home run of the season. Steven Souza Jr. followed with a single and took third on a double by Rasmus. Estrada avoided further damage when Souza was out in a rundown between third and home on a grounder to shortstop by Robertson and Derek Norris flied out to center. Dominic Leone replaced Estrada with one out in the fourth after singles by Smith and Dickerson. Longoria greeted Leone with a two-run double to bump the lead to 6-0.  There's no doubt it was a tough night for (Estrada),  Gibbons said.  Marco is a pin-point control guy for the most part and I think that's off for him right now.

The five-year-long legal battle exposed the cozy ties between government officials and powerful tycoons. The panel of five judges on Hong Kong's Court of Final Appeal found Thomas Kwok, the former co-chairman of Hong Kong's largest real estate company Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd, the city's former number two official Rafael Hui and two others, guilty of the charge of  conspiracy to commit misconduct in public office . Chief Justice Geoffrey Ma said of Kwok, 65, who had been released on bail during the appeal:  It will now be necessary for him to return to prison . Kwok looked calm but disappointed and lowered his head when he heard the verdict, according to local media.  He was sentenced to five years in jail and fined HK$500,000 ($64,440) in 2014. He had already served part of that sentence before the appeal.  No more appeals could be made on the case.  Hopelessly Compromised  The landmark trial tarnished Hong Kong's reputation for clean and efficient governance, with Sun Hung Kai Properties paying Hui millions of Hong Kong dollars in bribes, indirectly through two others, to gain government favor. Hong Kong tycoon Thomas Kwok, accompanied by his daughter Noelle, arrives at the Court of Final Appeal in Hong Kong, China June 14, 2017.Bobby YipIn a written summary of the judgment, the court wrote that once Hui had accepted a HK$8.5 million payment,  his independence when he assumed office would be hopelessly compromised and he could not properly discharge his duties nor be trusted to do so .  The abuse of public trust contemplated by the conspirators was clear , the statement added.      Hui, currently serving his seven-and-a-half years jail sentence, served as Chief Secretary and led the civil service from 2005 to 2007.  Slideshow (3 Images)During that period he was involved in important policy matters concerning two large property developments in which SHKP had  substantial interests,  the summary noted. The defendants' lawyers had asserted that Hui did not perform any specific act during his tenure to favor SHKP, and the payment was made shortly before his term started. But the court dismissed the arguments and said  those who were paying Rafael Hui that sum were not 'running a charity' . Thomas Kwok's brother and SHKP chairman Raymond Kwok, who was cleared of his charges in relation to the case in 2014, said he felt sad and disappointed at the outcome. Thomas Kwok's son and executive director of SHKP, Adam Kwok, told reporters after the verdict he felt helpless but accepted the judgment.  You can say he's careless ... you can say he's overly generous, but I know in his heart he does not have any intention to bribe. He really is an upright person,  he said. The two other defendants in the case are former SHKP executive director Thomas Chan and former Hong Kong Stock Exchange official Francis Kwan.

The S&P;/ASX 200 index climbed 1 percent, or 55.53 points, to 5,827.7 by 0324 GMT. The benchmark added 1.7 percent on Tuesday in its best day in seven months. Wall Street gained on Tuesday as tech stocks, which saw heavy selling over the weekend, bounced back and as investors positioned for an expected Federal Reserve rate rise later in the day. The Fed is scheduled to announce its monetary policy decision at 1800 GMT at the end of a two-day policy meeting, and may provide clues on the rate rise cycle this year.  We have seen a really strong bid coming into the market and I think a lot of it is down to global sentiment and momentum,  said Chris Weston, an institutional dealer with IG Markets.  I think the idea that stocks have done really well recently, continue to work brilliantly and maybe you can also make an assumption that the market is not particularly expensive.  Financials stocks, tracking their U.S. peers, led the gains on the benchmark, with Commonwealth Bank of Australia, the biggest bank by market value, posting a near 1 percent rise. Meanwhile, CBA's 'Big Four' peers rose in a range of 0.4 percent to 1.4 percent. The metals and miners index was held afloat by gold stocks gaining on higher yellow metal prices, and by a near one- percent rise in BHP shares. BHP rival Rio Tinto, however, lost 0.6 percent on persistent weakness in iron ore and base metal prices. China's iron ore futures slid to their weakest level in almost seven months on underlying concerns over surplus glut. The energy index was 0.2 percent higher helped by a 1 percent gain in oil and gas explorer Woodside Petroleum . Oil price rose overnight, although they fell by one percent early on Wednesday on U.S. stock builds and higher OPEC production.

Soccer's world governing body, FIFA, announced a monitoring system in 2016 for labor conditions at Russia's World Cup stadiums, and says the system has helped to improve labor standards. But in a statement accompanying the New York-based campaign group's report, Jane Buchanan, HRW's associate Europe and Central Asia director, said:  Construction workers on World Cup stadiums face exploitation and abuse, and FIFA has not yet shown that it can effectively monitor, prevent, and remedy these issues.  FIFA said that  while incompliances with relevant labor standards continue to be found â something to be expected in a project of this scale - the overall message of exploitation on the construction sites portrayed by HRW does not correspond with FIFA's assessment . A spokesperson said this assessment was based on quarterly inspections conducted by independent experts and trade union representatives. FIFA also said that it was Russian authorities who  ultimately have the responsibility to protect human and labor rights on their territory and ensure that construction companies are held accountable . Russia is set to host the World Cup next summer in 12 stadiums spread across 11 cities, including Moscow, St Petersburg, Kazan and Sochi.  These four cities are set to host matches in the Confederations Cup, a two-week tournament kicking off Saturday that will feature world champions Germany, the various regional champions and the host country. Russia's World Cup organizing committee was not available for immediate comment. In May, Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko told TASS news agency that construction works at the stadium in St Petersburg were in compliance with FIFA requirements and that workers' rights were not being violated.

The complaint said Trump had not sought congressional approval for any of the payments his hundreds of businesses had received from foreign governments since he took office in January, even though the Constitution requires him to do so. The White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment but has said Trump's business interests do not violate the Constitution. The Trump Organization has said it will donate profits from customers representing foreign governments to the U.S. Treasury but will not require such customers to identify themselves. At least 30 U.S. senators and 166 representatives are plaintiffs in Wednesday's lawsuit, representing the largest number of legislators ever to sue a U.S. president, according to two lawmakers who are among the plaintiffs. The Constitution's  foreign emoluments  clause bars U.S. officeholders from accepting payments and various other gifts from foreign governments without congressional approval.  The presidentâs failure to tell us about these emoluments, to disclose the payments and benefits that he is receiving, mean that we cannot do our job. We cannot consent to what we donât know,  said Senator Richard Blumenthal, one of the lawmakers bringing the lawsuit, in a conference call on Tuesday. Representative John Conyers, another plaintiff, added: âPresident Trump has conflicts of interest in at least 25 countries, and it appears heâs using his presidency to maximize his profits.  The Justice Department declined to comment. Similar lawsuits have been filed in recent months by parties including a nonprofit ethics group, a restaurant trade group, and the attorneys general of Maryland and the District of Columbia. They allege that Trump's acceptance of payments from foreign and U.S. governments through his hospitality empire puts other hotel and restaurant owners at an unfair disadvantage and provides governments an incentive to give Trump-owned businesses special treatment. Rare to Sue President In a motion to dismiss one such lawsuit on Friday, the Justice Department argued that the plaintiffs had not shown any specific harm to their businesses, and that Trump was only banned from receiving foreign government gifts if they arose from his service as president. On Monday, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said  partisan politics  was behind the lawsuit by the Maryland and District of Columbia officials. Lawmakers rarely sue the president, so there are few federal court decisions the legislators can cite to prove their legal standing to bring Wednesday's case, said Leah Litman, an assistant professor specializing in constitutional law at the University of California, Irvine.  But the constitutional provision they're suing to enforce gives them a role in how it's carried out, and that gives them a powerful standing argument,  Litman said. The lawmakers in Wednesday's lawsuit will be represented in court by the Constitutional Accountability Center, a public interest law firm in Washington. Each lawmaker is paying a share of the legal fees from personal or campaign accounts.
