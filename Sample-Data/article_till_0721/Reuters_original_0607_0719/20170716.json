Not ill will necessarily, but just a lot of familiarity.  We've faced him so many times we really don't have to watch much video on him anymore because you kind of know what he's got and what he likes to do,  Pirates shortstop Jordy Mercer said.  Sometimes he's just got it; sometimes he doesn't.  Lynn had it Saturday night. In his 20th career start against the Pirates, he pitched 6 1/3 scoreless innings and singled and scored in St. Louis' 4-0 victory at PNC Park.  I had good command most of the night,  he said.  Yanked a few breaking balls that I would have liked to have back, but I was able to get some outs with the breaking ball, too.  I was getting outs with every pitch. When you're moving the ball in and out, changing speeds, good things can happen.  Lynn (8-6) combined with relievers Matt Bowman, Trevor Rosenthal and Tyler Lyons for the nine-hit shutout. Lynn struck out three and walked none as he improved to 5-1 within the National League Central. He has held opponents to two earned runs or fewer in 13 of his 19 starts. One of those strong starts was not June 24, when he gave up seven runs over 5 2/3 innings in a 7-3 loss to Pittsburgh in St. Louis. Related CoveragePreview: Cardinals at PiratesSt. Louis Cardinals - PlayerWatchPittsburgh Pirates - PlayerWatch Today's ball had more giddy-up on it, and he was locating better. He was able to sink it better,  said Mercer, who was 1-for-4 for a Pittsburgh club that threatened at times but left nine men on base and was 1-for-10 with runners in scoring position. Tommy Pham was 3-for-4 with an RBI and a run scored for St. Louis, which scored one run in the fourth and three in the fifth. The Cardinals (44-46), third in the NL Central, kept the Pirates (43-48) from leapfrogging them. Pittsburgh had won three in a row and six of seven. Pirates starter Jameson Taillon (5-3) gave up four runs and eight hits in five innings, with five strikeouts and no walks. He was pitching for the first time since July 4, thanks to the All-Star break and being a late scratch from his scheduled start Sunday against the Cubs in Chicago because of food poisoning. Manager Clint Hurdle thought the long layoff affected Taillon.  It's a challenge. Eleven days off. I don't think he's ever experienced anything like that.  Hurdle said.  There's a lot of good to hunt out of it. I just think there was just a little too much rust to knock off.  Taillon had not surrendered a run in his previous two starts, and St. Louis' first run, in the fourth, ended a career-high streak of 18 2/3 scoreless innings.  As a starting pitcher, you always want to go deep into games,  Taillon said.  Going five just sounds gross. Anytime a starting pitcher goes five, it leaves a really sour taste in your mouth.  Taillon did not agree with Hurdle that the layoff was to blame.  I felt pretty fresh,  he said.  I don't think being wild was a problem, which is usually what I do when I'm rusty.  Pham doubled to lead off the fourth, moved to third on a grounder and scored on Jedd Gyorko's single to left for a 1-0 St. Louis lead. The threat ended when right fielder Gregory Polanco doubled Gyorko off first on Yadier Molina's line drive. In the fifth, Luke Voit led off with a base hit to left. Taillon struck out the next two batters before Lynn doubled to center, where Andrew McCutchen bobbled the ball, allowing Voit to score and make it 2-0. Lynn came home on Matt Carpenter's soft single up the middle. Carpenter stole second and scored on Pham's double for a 4-0 lead.  It changes the complexion of (Taillon's) outing,  Hurdle said of the Cardinals' three consecutive two-out hits. Lynn seemed as proud of the hit as he was his pitching performance. The hit came as a left-hander. He switched sides earlier this month.  I know when pitchers get hits off me, it (ticks) me off,  Lynn said.  It's good when two outs, the pitcher's up, (as a pitcher) you're thinking, 'A couple pitches and I'm out of the inning.' And then it didn't work and next thing he knows he's got to face the top of the lineup.  The Cardinals were pretty tickled about Lynn's left-handed blast.  Great launch angle,  manager Mike Matheny said kiddingly. NOTES: St. Louis RF Stephen Piscotty (right groin strain) was put on the 10-day disabled list. ... The Cardinals recalled OF Magneuris Sierra from Double-A Springfield. ... St. Louis sat 2B Kolten Wong, moved 1B Matt Carpenter to second base and gave IF Luke Voit a start at first base. ...

The Orioles did not have quite as much fun. Arrieta threw 6 2/3 strong innings in his return to Baltimore and Jason Heyward added a three-run triple as the Chicago Cubs hit three homers in a 10-3 rout of the Orioles on Saturday night. The Orioles (42-48) traded Arrieta to the Cubs in 2013 and the right-hander developed into one of the game's best pitchers after going 20-25 with a 5.46 ERA in Baltimore. He's now 63-28 as a Cub, including two no-hitters and a Cy Young Award (2015), and Saturday's game was the first time the right-hander has pitched at Camden Yards since the trade. However, Arrieta said he loved his time with the Orioles.  You know, I wouldn't trade the years I was here for anything,  Arrieta said.  It was an enjoyable experience. I learned a lot, and I'm able to be the player I am today because of what I went through while I was in the organization.  Arrieta showed Baltimore his new form, allowing just two runs and four hits. He struggled a bit at first, walking three in the first two innings before setting down 14 of the next 15 hitters. Related CoveragePreview: Cubs at OriolesChicago Cubs - PlayerWatchBaltimore Orioles - PlayerWatchThe Cubs took the lead while Arrieta was doing that, and the combination proved too much for the Orioles to overcome.  We really swung the bats well, and Jake pitched really good tonight and that was a large part of tonight's game,  Chicago manager Joe Maddon said.  The fact that he kept them in check while we opened up our lead, that's a nice formula.  Chicago (45-45) also gave Arrieta (9-7) plenty of offensive support. Albert Almora and Addison Russell each hit solo homers, and Heyward's triple was the big hit in a four-run fifth inning that gave the Cubs a 7-0 lead. Six of those seven runs came after there were two outs.  That's really frustrating to be that close to getting out of an inning unscathed,  Orioles manager Buck Showalter said.  With Arrieta out there, you feel like runs are going to be at a premium. You're trying to keep it close and see if you can do some damage.  Anthony Rizzo added a solo homer in the eighth -- the team's eighth home run in the first two games -- as the Cubs finished with 16 hits. Kris Bryant, Willson Contreras and Javier Baez each banged out three hits and led the way as Chicago never went down in order. Baltimore starter Wade Miley's struggles continued. Miley (4-8) allowed seven runs and nine hits -- with four walks and two homers -- in 4 2/3 innings. Caleb Joseph drove in two of Baltimore's runs with a homer and an RBI single. Arrieta needed 27 pitches to get through the first inning but escaped without damage as the Orioles stranded two. The Cubs then went back to their power to take command early. Almora started the third with a first-pitch homer, and Russell added a long solo homer with two outs in the fourth. Miley walked the next two hitters before Almora added an RBI single to center that put the Cubs up 3-0. In the fifth, Heyward ended Miley's night with the three-run triple to center. Baez greeted right-hander Miguel Castro with an RBI single to cap the four-run inning that gave the Cubs the 7-0 lead.  I definitely feel better about my delivery, but you've got to keep working and fine-tune things,  Miley said.  I've just got to get back in the bullpen and continue to work.  Joseph put the Orioles on the board with a solo homer in the fifth. NOTES: RHP Mike Wright (shoulder bursitis) and RHP Stefan Crichton (shoulder strain) will each have rehab assignments starting Monday, according to Orioles manager Buck Showalter. ... The skipper also said the minor leagues could be an option for struggling RHP Kevin Gausman, but the team really isn't ready to make a move like that. ... RHP John Lackey (plantar fasciitis in right foot) threw well before the game. Cubs manager Joe Maddon said that if everything stays fine, he will be activated and pitch Tuesday. ...

The payment to the Law Offices of Alan S. Futerfas, dated June 27, was disclosed in a filing with the Federal Election Commission on Saturday. It was described as covering  legal consulting  fees.  Trump Jr. admitted to meeting with a Russian lawyer in New York City during the 2016 presidential campaign after he was told she might have damaging information about his father's rival, Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. The payment was made to Futerfas' firm days before the story about the meeting broke, which caused a scramble inside the White House and Trump Tower to contain it.  The disclosures do not say who Futerfas was hired to represent. Spokesmen for Trump's re-election campaign and Futerfas did not respond to requests for comment.  Futerfas was revealed as Trump Jr.'s lawyer on Monday after a New York Times report detailed meetings between the president's eldest son and the Russian lawyer. Futerfas has not said when he was hired.      Separately, the campaign also paid more than $538,000 to Jones Day, the law firm that represented Trump's campaign during the election. The campaign also paid $89,561 for  legal consulting  to The Trump Corporation, which is owned by the president. The payment was dated June 30th. A federal special counsel and several congressional panels are investigating allegations by U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia meddled in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, as well as potential connections between Russian officials and the Trump campaign. Moscow has denied any interference and the president and Trump Jr. have denied any collusion. The Federal Election Commission has previously ruled that candidates and federal office holders may spend campaign funds on legal fees incurred because they were a candidate. Trump has also hired a longtime legal adviser, Marc Kasowitz, as outside counsel. His campaign finance disclosure did not list any payments to Kasowitz. The White House confirmed in a statement on Saturday that veteran Washington attorney Ty Cobb will serve as special counsel, and sources familiar with the hiring said Cobb would handle the White House's response to the Russia-related investigations. Cobb, a partner at the law firm Hogan Lovells, is expected to be an intermediary between the White House and Congress, as well as outside attorneys as the probes continue.  In the second quarter of 2017, Trump's re-election campaign raised about $8 million and spent $4.4 million, according to Saturday's disclosures. Much of the money raised from individuals came in the form of  small dollar  donations, classed as donations of less than $250. Trump and his campaign have frequently touted the number of small-dollar donors as proof of his widespread support. Trump filed for re-election the day after taking office - allowing his campaign to continue to raise and spend money while he is in office.

The Rangers had scored 29 runs in his first three starts since coming off the disabled list. They had averaged 9.29 runs per nine innings in his eight starts. But one run was sufficient Saturday night. Shin-Soo Choo's opposite-field single with one out in the ninth inning scored pinch runner Joey Gallo and gave the Rangers a 1-0 victory over the Kansas City Royals. Hamels, who got a no-decision, and Danny Duffy matched up in a pitcher's duel.  We were both having really short innings so we were kind of building off that and getting through the game, and all of a sudden, you look up and it is the eighth inning, it is the ninth inning,  Hamels said.  Duffy is a tremendous pitcher. He was making good pitches, getting good outs, and it was up to me to go out and match him. It was kind of nice to be able to do that.  Related CoveragePreview: Rangers at RoyalsTexas Rangers - PlayerWatchKansas City Royals - PlayerWatchJonathan Lucroy led off the ninth with a single and Gallo ran for him. Delino DeShields' sacrifice bunt advanced Gallo to second. Choo, who was mired in a 4-for-33 skid, singled to left on Duffy's next pitch, getting Gallo home.  Obviously the run scored on those 130-foot hits, but there could have been so many more base runners,  Duffy said.  I didn't look back at the two singles in the ninth, but obviously it was pretty weakly hit so I'm guessing that I executed pretty well. On paper those beat us, but our team kept us in the game.  Duffy (5-6) permitted one run on five hits over 8 1/3 innings. He struck out four and walked none. The only batter to reach base off Duffy after Mike Napoli's leadoff triple in the second was Carlos Gomez twice until the run in the ninth. Gomez singled in the fifth, but Duffy picked him off. Gomez had a one-out fly ball single to right in the eighth, but was soon erased when Rougned Odor grounded into a double play. The Rangers asked for a crew chief review on Napoli's triple that landed high off the right-field fence. After an 88-second review, the call stood.  I knew the ball hit the rail. We wanted to make sure it didn't ricochet off a fan, which would have been a home run,  Rangers manager Jeff Banister said.  We didn't want to leave a run off the board at that point.  Hamels was just as good as Duffy. He worked out of a bases-loaded jam in the fourth. The next hit off Hamels was Lorenzo Cain's two-out single in the sixth. Hamels was removed after Whit Merrifield's two-out double in the eighth on his 99th pitch. Jose Leclerc replaced Hamels and struck out Jorge Bonifacio to end the inning. Hamels extended his scoreless-inning streak to 21 innings, the longest active streak in the American League. Hamels allowed four hits, one walk and five strikeouts over 7 1/3 innings. Leclerc (2-2) picked up the victory.  Both pitchers were at their top of their game. Both pitchers were throwing the ball extremely well,  Royals manager Ned Yost said.  Two jam shots. Lucroy hit the ball that kind of dunked into right field and then the bunt. Choo's ball that he fisted on a changeup and dumped into left.  After Leclerc walked Lorenzo Cain on four pitches to lead off the ninth, Alex Claudio replaced him. Claudio fell behind in the count 3-0 to Eric Hosmer before striking him out and got Salvador Perez to ground into a game-ending double play.  This really stinks because Duff pitched so well,  said Hosmer, who went 0-for-4 to end his 16-game hitting streak.  And we just couldn't get a run for him.  The Royals (44-45) have lost five straight while the Rangers (45-45) have won five of their last six games. The Rangers have won 12 straight over the Royals dating to last season. NOTES: Royals RHP Nathan Karns will undergo thoracic outlet syndrome season-ending surgery Wednesday. Manager Ned Yost is optimistic Karns will be ready to go in spring training. ...

Gregorius ripped a go-ahead RBI single to highlight a three-run 16th inning for the New York Yankees in a 4-1 victory over the rival Boston Red Sox in a five-hour, 50-minute game on Saturday at Fenway Park.  It's a good feeling,  Yankees manager Joe Girardi said of watching Gregorius' timely hit.  Our guys were really good at tacking on.  New York (46-42) bounced back after star closer Aroldis Chapman issued a walk-off walk to Andrew Benintendi in Friday's 5-4 series-opening loss after entering the ninth with a 4-3 lead. On Saturday, Jacoby Ellsbury doubled off Red Sox reliever Doug Fister (0-3) to open the Yankees' 16th. Chase Headley's bloop single to center field put runners on first and third to set up Gregorius' single to center. Austin Romine followed with another RBI single and Gary Sanchez added a sacrifice fly after a Ronald Torreyes sacrifice bunt and Fister's intentional walk to Brett Gardner. Matt Holliday clubbed a game-tying solo homer in the ninth, his 16th of the season, off closer Craig Kimbrel for New York, which had lost 19 of its last 26 games coming in and pulled within 3 1/2 games of American League East-leading Boston (51-40).  It's a huge win for this team with the way some of the things had gone,  Girardi said. Related CoveragePreview: Yankees at Red SoxNew York Yankees - PlayerWatchBoston Red Sox - PlayerWatchYankees starter Luis Severino permitted one run, four hits and two walks with six strikeouts in seven innings. Ben Heller (1-0) struck out three and pitched the final two innings for the victory. Boston starter Chris Sale, the American League starter in the All-Star Game on Tuesday, matched a season high with 13 strikeouts in 7 2/3 scoreless innings. Sale became the first Red Sox pitcher since Pedro Martinez in 2003 with multiple 10-plus strikeout games against the Yankees in a season.  He's been outstanding,  Red Sox manager John Farrell said.  On a day where I thought he pitched under control, he had real good power early on but then he pitched comfortably throughout the rest of the ballgame.  The left-hander allowed three hits and two walks before being relieved by Kimbrel, who proceeded to blow his second save since July 3 and his first at Fenway. Kimbrel had converted a Fenway-record 30 consecutive saves. Mitch Moreland drove in the lone run for Boston, which suffered only its second loss in nine extra-inning games this season. Holliday took Kimbrel deep to lead off the inning, sending a 1-1 pitch approximately 443 feet over the Green Monster in left.  Just trying to stay on the fastball and put a good swing on the fastball and caught it luckily,  Holliday said. Said Kimbrel:  He put a good swing on it, hit it a long ways. That's usually what happens when I give them (home runs) up.  Dellin Betances tossed a scoreless ninth to push the game to extras. A strange sequence highlighted the Yankees' 11th as Ellsbury sent a grounder to first with Holliday on first. Moreland fielded the ball on a bounce and fired to second for the first out, but Holliday turned around and slid back into first just as Ellsbury reached. Moreland didn't see shortstop Xander Bogaerts' throw to first as Holliday blocked his view as the ball struck Ellsbury as he hit the bag, leading to an umpires review for a rules check. The original call that Ellsbury was safe was upheld after a nearly five-minute review. Farrell told the umpires that the Red Sox would play the rest of the game under protest.  I just assumed that (Moreland) touched the base,  Holliday said.  He didn't, so that's kind of what happened.  Red Sox reliever Blaine Boyer was removed from the game in the 13th inning with right elbow tightness. Bogaerts' infield single with one out in the third loaded the bases for Moreland, who drove a ball to center for a sacrifice fly.

Liu, 61, died of multiple organ failure on Thursday in a hospital in the northeastern city of Shenyang, where he was being treated for late-stage liver cancer, having been given medical parole but not freed. He had been jailed for 11 years in 2009 for  inciting subversion of state power  after helping to write a petition known as  Charter 08  calling for sweeping political reforms. His widow, Liu Xia, has been under effective house arrest since her husband won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010, but had been allowed to visit him in prison about once a month. She has never been formally charged with any crime. Speaking at a government-arranged news conference, Liu Xiaobo's eldest brother Liu Xiaoguang offered thanks several times to the Communist Party for its thoughtful care considering the dissident's  special situation .  Why has Liu Xia not come here? Her health is very weak at the moment,  Liu Xiaoguang said, sitting in between an English-language interpreter and a Shenyang government official.  So she can't come here. It's very regretful.  After speaking for about 20 minutes, Liu was escorted out by two unidentified women, an unlit cigarette in his mouth, and did not answer questions from journalists who surrounded him. The government then showed reporters images of the ashes being scattered from a boat. City government information official Zhang Qingyang said Liu Xia and Liu Xiaoguang had decided upon the scattering of ashes at sea. Related CoverageAustralia urges China to release dissident Liu Xiaobo's widowBut close friend and fellow dissident Hu Jia said the motivation behind the sea burial was so that there was  nothing to remember him by on Chinese soil  and so that supporters could not create a shrine to pay tribute to him.   We know that Liu Xiaobo's home is Beijing, his spiritual home is here, his love was also found here,  he said. Hu said it was well-known among Liu's friends that his elder brother did not agree with his political views and that it was a cynical move for him to be presented to the media as representing Liu Xia and the family.   The extent to what the authorities are capable of always exceeds our imagination, they always have something worse than imagined planned,  Hu said of the news conference.  Crude, Cruel and Callous  A protester holds a defaced Chinese national flag with words  fascist kills Liu Xiaobo , as he mourns the death of Nobel laureate Liu Xiaobo, outside China's Liaison Office in Hong Kong, China July 15, 2017.Bobby YipNicholas Bequelin, Amnesty International's East Asia Regional Director, tweeted that the news conference was  one of the most crude, cruel and callous political show(s) I have ever witnessed . Government official Zhang, speaking earlier, said Liu's widow was  currently free , adding that as a Chinese citizen, her rights would be protected under the law.      But she just lost her spouse. She is extremely sad. In the period after dealing with the death of Liu Xiaobo, she won't take anymore outside disturbances. This is the wish of the family members. It's natural.  Zhang did not say where Liu Xia currently was. A government statement said Mozart's Requiem was played during the funeral, a work of music Mozart left unfinished on his death bed. Slideshow (8 Images)Liu family lawyer Mo Shaoping told Reuters he did not know whether the cremation was in accordance with family wishes, however, as they had been unreachable.  They are likely still to be under the watch and control of authorities,  Mo said.  They can't be contacted.  In funeral photographs handed out by the government, Liu Xia and other family members stand around the coffin containing Liu's body, surrounded by white flowers that signify mourning in China. During the past couple of weeks, Liu Xia had been at the hospital as her husband's health deteriorated. Rights groups and Western governments have mourned Liu Xiaobo's death and urged authorities to grant freedom of movement to his wife and the rest of his family. Several thousand people in Hong Kong held an evening vigil for Liu, holding up candles and white roses in a largely silent march to China's main representative office. Some carried banners calling Liu a  people's hero  and demanding Liu Xia be truly freed.  Even though he is dead, his fight and beliefs will never be forgotten,  said a 62-year-old marcher surnamed Wu.  We have to do something to commemorate him.   China has repeatedly attacked foreign governments for their concern about Liu and calls to allow Liu Xia to leave the country if she wishes, and foreign reporters in Shenyang have been closely monitored by plainclothes security. Efforts are being made to secure permission from Chinese authorities for Liu Xia and her brother Liu Hui to leave, a Western diplomat said on Friday. The last Nobel Peace Prize winner to live out his dying days under state surveillance was Carl von Ossietzky, a pacifist who died in Berlin in Nazi Germany in 1938.

Stop trying to get strikeouts and start focusing on getting outs. Evidently, the message resonated with Michael Fulmer. Fulmer delivered a masterful performance, getting ahead of hitters and checking the Blue Jays on two hits over eight innings in the Tigers' 11-1 rout at Comerica Park. Fulmer posted his fourth straight win to improve to 10-6 for Detroit (40-49).  It is a lot easier on the defense when you aren't making them stand around for 20 minutes every half-inning,  Ausmus said.  He got outs quickly and that has an effect on the entire team.  The game doesn't get stagnant when he's on the mound.  Opposition hitters do, though. Related CoveragePreview: Blue Jays at TigersToronto Blue Jays - PlayerWatchDetroit Tigers - PlayerWatch He just looked like he was attacking,  Blue Jays catcher Russell Martin said of Fulmer.  Just being aggressive, getting strike one as quickly as possible.  He had good life on the fastball, good movement and a good slider to go with it. He was mixing in some change-ups, too. But I think the key for him was making quality pitches early and just staying aggressive.  Fulmer agreed that the words to the pitching staff from the team's skipper were sound advice, and a formula he prefers to follow when he's on the mound.  I'm worried about getting outs, and strikeouts mean more pitches,  Fulmer said.  There are times when you want to try to strike a guy out, but I'm happy with a weak grounder to short.  It's the third time in his last four starts that Fulmer has worked eight innings, but this one felt extra special to him.  I felt like I needed a start like this, where I was able to miss a lot of barrels and get a lot of weak contact,  Fulmer said.  I'm not a huge strikeout pitcher at this point, but I trust my defense to make plays for me.  The Tigers took advantage of the long ball and the wildness of Toronto starter Francisco Liriano to pile up the runs and quickly gain an advantage. Liriano didn't retire a batter after walking the bases loaded in the third and left the game, suffering from neck stiffness. He allowed five earned runs and three hits to drop to 5-5.  His neck tightened up,  Toronto manager John Gibbons said.  Muscle spasms. He didn't last long. You could tell it started to affect him. We've seen bouts of wildness with him on occasion, but he really lost it.  Nicholas Castellanos, the second batter Liriano faced, drove a 1-0 offering into the right-field seats to open the scoring for Detroit. The solo shot was the 11th home run of the year for Castellanos.  I was just happy to put a good swing on a ball and get us off to a quick start,  Castellanos said.  When you get that early lead, it puts more pressure on the pitcher.  Detroit kept the pressure building, doubling its advantage in the second inning. Jose Iglesias looped a two-out single into shallow right field, scoring Mikie Mahtook. After chasing Liriano, J.D. Martinez welcomed reliever Mike Bolsinger by stroking his first pitch into left field for a two-run single. Mahtook's sacrifice fly brought home Miguel Cabrera to give the Tigers a 5-0 lead over the Blue Jays (42-48). The Tigers continued to pile up the runs. Iglesias scored on a fielder's choice and Cabrera clouted a two-run homer, his 12th of the year, during a three-run Detroit sixth. Martinez hit his 15th homer of the season, a three-run shot in the eighth inning. The Blue Jays shattered Fulmer's shutout bid in the fourth when Jose Bautista, who had drawn a leadoff walk, scored on a groundout by Josh Donaldson but after giving Fulmer such a decisive advantage so quickly, Gibbons knew his team was in for a long night.  He gets a lead like that, the good ones, they're not going to let you get back in,  Gibbons said.  When you fall out of it so quick, that's what happens.  NOTES: Tigers LHP Daniel Norris, on the disabled list with a groin strain, will throw another bullpen session Sunday before it is determined whether he will be activated to start Tuesday at Kansas City. ... Detroit 2B Ian Kinsler returned to his usual leadoff spot in the batting order after missing Friday's game because of illness. ... The Tigers held a closed-door meeting before the game, but the players and manager Brad Ausmus declined to talk about what was discussed during the session. ... The Blue Jays are 5-3 in their last eight games but have been outscored 57-36 in that stretch. ... The Los Angeles Angels (.593) are the only American League team to own a greater winning percentage in July the past four seasons than the Blue Jays, who are 48-38 (.558) during the month since 2014. ...

The former world number one amateur was not at his very best, but a three-under-par 68 left him with the same advantage at the end of the day as when he started. Rodgers posted a 16-under 197 score at TPC Deere Run in Silvis, while fellow Americans Daniel Berger (63) and Scott Stallings (64) rocketed into second place on 14 under. Sixteen players are lurking within five strokes of Rodgers, who will continue to play with an attacking mindset. “This is a nice course to play with the lead because you have to keep the pedal down all day,” Rodgers told CBS television after his eight-foot par putt at the last sneaked in. “Sixteeen-under's not going to win tomorrow so I need to go out and make a lot of birdies. It was nice to have that mindset today. You’re not really holding on, you’re still trying to be aggressive and make birdies.” The winner on Sunday will earn a spot in next week’s British Open. World number 20 Berger, already exempt for Royal Birkdale, continued his sizzling form, moving into contention for the third time in four starts.

He has not played since that second-placing and did not want to go into a major without a tune-up under his belt. “I love playing the week before a major so this fit into my schedule quite well,” he said after matching his career-low round on tour. “In Memphis I drove the ball phenomenally and this week I haven’t driven it so well but I’ve kept it in play for the most part.

The Whittier Fire, which broke out July 8 and has already destroyed eight homes, had been more than 50 percent contained on Friday before so-called  Sundowner  winds picked up in the evening, according to a California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) website. Nearly 3,000 people who were forced to flee their homes near Cachuma Lake and the community of Goleta remained under evacuation orders as fire officials said another evening of Sundowners could drive the flames toward populated areas.  The fire continues burning in an area above the community of Goleta and crews continue to build containment and contingency lines to hold the fire in check,  Cal Fire said on the Inciweb fire-tracking website.  The east and west flanks of the fire continue to burn towards established containment lines.  More than 1,600 firefighters were working the blaze, assisted by water-dropping planes and helicopters. Highway 154 was shut down in both directions and the Los Padres National Park was closed to the public. Evacuation shelters were opened at a high school in Goleta. The conflagration, which had blackened 17,364 acres along California's scenic central coast as of Saturday afternoon, was being fed by brush and vegetation that had not burned since 1955, according to fire officials.

Large, old oak trees are continuing to burn well after the fire has past, leaving hazardous snags along highways and firelines.  The Whittier Fire is among more than 50 large, active wildfires burning across the U.S. West as forecasters warned that hot, dry conditions could persist, creating tinderbox conditions.

Still, firefighters have made significant gains against the so-called Wall Fire, which had damaged or destroyed 44 homes in Butte County and more than 60 other structures, calling it mostly contained as of Saturday.  The Alamo Fire, which charred some 29,000 acres and destroyed at least one home in San Luis Obispo County, was said to be 92 percent contained as of Saturday morning.

Xu Zhiyong, whose  New Citizens' Movement  advocated working within the system to press for change, was detained in 2013 and subsequently convicted of  gathering a crowd to disturb public order . One of the group's main demands had been for officials to publicly disclose their assets, a demand taken against the backdrop of the ruling Communist Party's own efforts to crackdown on deep-seat corruption under President Xi Jinping. Xu's lawyer, Zhang Qingfang, told Reuters he had brought Xu up to speed with  events on the outside , including the death of fellow activist and Nobel Peace Prize laureate, Liu Xiaobo. He said Xu was  upset  upon hearing the news. Zhang said Xu, who was released from his jail on Beijing's outskirts on Saturday morning, was in good physical condition and had few immediate plans beyond spending time with family.  At the height of Xu's activism, he attracted hundreds of supporters who participated in activities related to the movement, having first gained prominence in 2003 for helping victims of tainted baby formula and migrant workers without access to healthcare and education.  It prompted a crackdown from the Communist Party, which swiftly crushes any perceived challenge to its rule.   The idea of the New Citizens Movement is not to overthrow, but to establish,  he wrote in a 2010 essay.  It's not one social class displacing another social class, but allowing righteousness to take its place in China.  Xu refused to defend himself in his 2014 trial, and remained silent as a way to protest what Zhang said was a controlled legal process where a guilty outcome was a foregone conclusion.     As international rights groups and foreign governments call for Chinese authorities to guarantee freedom for Liu Xiaobo's widow, Liu Xia, Xu's supporters have also expressed concern whether he will remain under close watch or effective house arrest. Some said on social media they were barred by security guards and plain-clothed officers from entering Xu's apartment compound on Saturday.  Other high-profile and politically sensitive prisoners released from jail, including rights lawyer Pu Zhiqiang and journalist Gao Yu, remain closely watched by Chinese authorities.  I hope he will be completely free,  Zhang said. Xu taught law at a Beijing university and ran in a local election. He became prominent over a drive to abolish  custody and repatriation  powers, a form of arbitrary detention used by local governments to sweep homeless people off the streets.

China's Feng broke a three-way tie with a three-foot birdie putt after missing chances from 10 feet and twice from 12 feet in the closing holes, posting a one-under 71 for a total of nine-under-par 207 at Trump National Golf Club. Amy Yang and 17-year-old amateur Choi Hye-jin were tied one stroke back, with long-hitting fellow Korean Park Sung-hyun two further shots away.

U.S. officials halted screening interviews and departed the Pacific island of Nauru on Friday, two weeks short of their scheduled timetable and a day after Washington said the United States had reached its annual refugee intake cap.   U.S. (officials) were scheduled to be on Nauru until July 26 but they left on Friday,  one refugee told Reuters, requesting anonymity as he did not want to jeopardize his application for U.S. resettlement.  In the United States, a senior member of the union that represents refugee officers at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), a Department of Homeland Security agency, told Reuters his own trip to Nauru was not going forward as scheduled.  Jason Marks, chief steward of the American Federation of Government Employees Local 1924, told Reuters his trip has now been pushed back and it was unclear whether it will actually happen. The USCIS said on Saturday that the program would continue but offered no details.   We do not discuss the exact dates of USCIS' circuit rides to adjudicate refugees' applications. However, we are planning return trips,  the agency said in a statement.    It is not uncommon for the dates of tentatively planned refugee circuit ride trips worldwide to change due to a wide variety of factors.  The Australian Immigration Department declined to comment on the whereabouts of the U.S. officials or the future of a refugee swap agreement between Australia and the United States that President Donald Trump earlier this year branded a  dumb deal . Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said on Sunday the deal was progressing as expected, reiterating the government had assurances from the Trump administration. “The quota will roll over again on October 1 as I said, and I expect that the United States will adhere to this agreement, as the president promised,” she told the Australian Broadcasting Corp.  An indefinite postponement of the deal would have significant repercussions for Australia's pledge to close a second detention center on Papua New Guinea's Manus island on Oct 31. Only 70 refugees, less than 10 percent of the total detainees held in the camp, have completed U.S. processing. FILE PHOTO: Protesters from the Refugee Action Coalition hold placards during a demonstration outside the offices of the Australian Government Department of Immigration and Border Protection in Sydney, Australia, April 29, 2016.David Gray/File PhotoBishop said she did not believe it was the case only 10 percent of refugees had been processed.  The U.S. deal looks more and more doubtful,  Ian Rintoul from the Refugee Action Coalition said.  The U.S. deal was never the solution the Australian government pretended it to be.  Former U.S. President Barack Obama agreed a deal with Australia late last year to offer refuge to up to 1,250 asylum seekers, a deal the Trump administration said it would only honor to maintain a strong relationship with Australia and then only on condition that refugees satisfied strict checks. In exchange, Australia has pledged to take Central American refugees from a center in Costa Rica, where the United States has taken in a larger number of people in recent years. The swap is designed, in part, to help Australia close both Manus and Nauru, which are expensive to run and have been widely criticized by the United Nations and others over treatment of detainees. The U.S. government confirmed on Thursday that its refugee intake cap of 50,000 people had been reached with the new intake year not due to begin until Oct. 1. Exemptions could be made for those who have a  credible claim to a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States,  following a decision from the U.S. Supreme Court last month reviving elements of Trump's travel ban while it considers the legality of the order. Given the risky boat journey the refugees in Manus and Nauru undertook to reach Australia, it is unlikely many of them have strong family ties to the United States, experts said. The majority of the detainees interviewed on both Manus and Nauru by U.S. officials in April are from Sudan, Somalia and Afghanistan. Australia's hardline immigration policy requires asylum seekers intercepted at sea trying to reach Australia to be sent for processing to camps at Manus and on Nauru. They are told they will never be settled in Australia. Trump's resistance to the refugee deal had strained relations with a key Asia Pacific ally, triggering a fractious phone call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull earlier this year. Trump's concession and a series of high-level visits by U.S. dignities have since help mend connections between the two countries.  Australia has already offered detainees up to $25,000 to voluntarily return to their home countries, an offer few have taken up.

Illinois Governor Bruce Rauner on Friday issued a disaster proclamation for Lake, McHenry and Kane counties and pledged the support of the state government to people whose properties were damaged or destroyed. Thousands of homes were affected by flooding after storms dumped more than 7 inches (18 cm) of rain in the area on Tuesday and Wednesday, said Patti Thompson, a spokeswoman for the Illinois Emergency Management Agency. The full extent of damage was still unknown, but houses had their basements inundated and some structures may have suffered worse, Thompson said. No injuries or deaths have been reported.  Until the water goes down, it's hard to get a firm number,  Thompson said by phone.  We still have a few more days when we're going to see levels rising in some of these areas.  In Lake County alone, which includes Chicago's affluent suburb of Highland Park, an official said at a news conference Friday that 2,100 structures were submerged and 5,800 structures could ultimately be flooded.   Muddy water lapped against homes and covered roadways in the communities of Round Lake Beach, Des Plaines and Lincolnshire, and residents walked through water that reached their ankles or higher, in photos published by the Chicago Tribune.

Three-quarters of an inch (1.9 cm) of rain was forecast in scattered showers late on Saturday into early Sunday, said meteorologist Michael Musher of the federal Weather Prediction Center.

Even so, officials fear water flowing downstream from Wisconsin could exacerbate flooding in areas north of Chicago. The water level in the Fox River in Algonquin, a small community about 40 miles (64 km) northwest of downtown Chicago, was at nearly 12 feet (3.7 meters), which is above the flood stage, said meteorologist Charles Mott of the National Weather Service. The Fox River was expected to peak on Monday evening at 12.9 feet (3.9 meters), Mott said. Severe weather was also expected in other parts of the country on Saturday. Areas around Nashville, Tennessee, could see heavy rain, and thunderstorms could strike parts of the Rocky Mountain range, Musher said.

The conflagration, which broke out on Friday afternoon and took firefighters about four hours to extinguish, sent debris raining down from the Marco Polo tower onto an oceanfront tourist district, forcing the closure of a major road and sending thick, black smoke billowing over the city.   It also highlighted the absence of sprinkler systems in some older buildings. These became mandatory in Honolulu high-rises in 1974. The Marco Polo, which has 586 units, opened three years earlier.  Without a doubt if there was sprinklers in this apartment, the fire would be contained to the unit of origin,  Honolulu Fire Chief Manuel Neves told reporters. It took more than 100 firefighters to control the blaze.    The blaze erupted a month to the day after the tragedy at  Grenfell Tower, the London high-rise where at least 80 people died in a fire in an older building also unequipped with sprinklers.  Investigators believe the Marco Polo fire broke out on the 26th floor of the building, Honolulu Fire Department spokesman David Jenkins said, adding that investigators hoped to begin nailing down the cause quickly.

Carter, 92, collapsed while working on Thursday at the Winnipeg construction site for Habitat for Humanity, which promotes affordable home ownership, and was taken to St. Boniface General Hospital for medical treatment and tests. By Friday morning, Carter was smiling as he returned to the building site to help kick off the project's last day. Hours later, he and his wife, Rosalynn Carter, 89, attended closing ceremonies at the Canadian Museum for Human Rights in Manitoba's capital, receiving a rousing ovation from the crowd.

I knew he had a good heart.  Thursday's health scare generated an outpouring of support for Carter, a Democrat who served in the White House from January 1977 to January 1981 and has lived longer after his term in office than any other president in U.S. history. A high point of his presidency was Carter's role in brokering the 1978 Camp David Accords that ushered in peace between Israel and Egypt.  But having left office profoundly unpopular, he is widely regarded as a better former president than he was a president, and received the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002 for his humanitarian work. Carter disclosed in August 2015 that he had been diagnosed with a form of skin cancer called melanoma that had spread to his brain and elsewhere and had been spotted during liver surgery. But months later, Carter told the Maranatha Baptist Church, where he teaches Sunday school in his home town of Plains, Georgia, that his latest brain scan showed no sign of the disease. Carter was in Canada for a project to build 150 new homes for needy families, celebrating the country's 150th independence anniversary.

PARIS (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron said his defense chief has no choice but to agree with what he says, a weekly newspaper reported on Sunday, after his top general criticized spending cuts to this year's budget.  If something opposes the military chief of staff and the president, the military chief of staff goes,  Macron, who as president is also the commander-in-chief of the armed forces, told Le Journal du Dimanche (JDD).  Macron said on Thursday that he would not tolerate public dissent from the military after General Pierre de Villiers reportedly told a parliament committee he would not let the government  fuck with  him on spending cuts. De Villiers still has Macron's  full trust,  the president told JDD, provided the top general  knows the chain of command and how it works.   No one deserves to be blindly followed,  De Villiers wrote in a message posted on his Facebook page on Friday.  De Villiers' last Facebook post is an open letter addressed to new military recruits that makes no mention of Macron. But it was perceived by French media as targeting the president's earlier comments. De Villiers and Macron are scheduled to meet next Friday afternoon, according to the president's official agenda. The French government trimmed the 2017 defense budget to ensure France meets its commitment to bring its budget deficit below the European Union cap of 3 percent of national income in 2017. De Villiers, whose mandate as the military chief of staff was extended by a year on Wednesday by the new defense minister, criticized at a parliamentary committee hearing on the same day the 850-million-euro ($975 million) cut in this year's budget.

Like many a brutal demise, the end was messy and at times uncomfortable to watch as the Spaniard cut loose after tense early exchanges, winning nine straight games to crush the demoralized American 7-5 6-0. It was Muguruza's second grand slam title to add to last year's French Open and was indisputably deserved after she absorbed everything her opponent could throw at her before taking control and inflicting a punishing triple break in the final set.  She was robbed of the picture-perfect conclusion and forced to wait as Hawk-eye was called on to confirm that a mis-hit forehand from Venus had landed out before her emotional celebrations could begin.  It was the 23-year-old's second Wimbledon final, having lost to Venus's sister Serena on the same stage in 2015, and her legs gave way as she fell to the ground after the decision was relayed on Centre Court's giant scoreboards.  “Two years ago I lost in the final to Serena and she told me one day I was going to maybe win and hey, two years after here I am,  she said courtside.  I played very well since the first game, and I kept the level, which is very hard because, you're nervous... I was just very composed,  she added later.  Related CoverageTwo's company as magnificent Muguruza finds winning formulaList of Wimbledon women's singles championsFactbox: Wimbledon champion Garbine MuguruzaFor Venus, who seemed to lack any sort of fight as the final blows were landed, it was a stinging reminder of her advancing years.  The five-times champion had last triumphed at the All England Club in 2008. She was looking to become the oldest woman to win a grand slam in the professional era and the most senior to triumph on Wimbledon's lawns since 1908.  Having been diagnosed with Sjogren's syndrome, an illness that causes fatigue and joint pain, in 2011 and seen her ranking plummet to 103, her renaissance this year is still hugely impressive.  Yet her capitulation ensured a second grand slam final defeat of 2017, after she was also downed by her sister at the Australian Open.

Meek Surrender While it ended in a meek surrender, the first women's final played under the Centre Court roof had begun as a tense duel between two of the game's most powerful hitters, with a high-quality first set gradually building toward a captivating conclusion.  It included several tests of nerve for Muguruza, who showed an almost iron will not to give an inch even as Venus upped the aggression levels with ferocious intent.  Slideshow (22 Images)Muguruza saved three break points, which included two tension-filled set points in the 10th game, the first of which saw the Spaniard emerge with a clenched fist from an epic 19-shot rally. It was then her turn to go on the offensive. She crafted her third break point of the set when Venus netted a forehand and took her chance when the American sent a second forehand long after another lengthy exchange. There were few clues in those opening games as to what was about to follow as having wrapped up the first set, Muguruza put her foot to the floor with astonishing brutality.  She broke on three straight occasions in the second set as Venus seemed to hit a mental and physical wall. When the five-times winner could barely get her racket to a vicious forehand, it gave the Spaniard three match points, but in keeping with a messy second set, she needed two Hawk-eye challenges to put the beleaguered American out of her misery.  As the scoreboard showed the ball had bounced out at 40-30, she dropped her racket and fell to the ground, before covering her face in celebration. After being handed the famous Rosewater Dish, Muguruza was asked if she had a message for her coach Sam Sumyk, who is absent as his wife is expecting a baby. She held the gleaming plate aloft and said:  Here it is.    Reporting by Toby Davis; Editing by Ed Osmond","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-tennis-wimbledon-muguruza-idUSKBN1A00IE"},

Disney has dominated the box office with animated and live-action films, which include the Marvel superheroes,  Star Wars,  princesses, pirates and musicals. For the lead role in live-action Arabian tale  Aladdin,  Disney introduced newcomer Mena Massoud, after trade publications reported this week that the studio had trouble finding an actor of the right ethnicity.

The announcement of a live-action  Lion King  film based on the 1994 animated classic, to be directed by Jon Favreau, received the warmest welcome. Footage showed a vibrant sunset across the African plains as photo-realistic computer-generated animals congregate to welcome a baby lion. A first look at  Mary Poppins Returns  showed Emily Blunt's take on the singing, no-nonsense nanny with magical powers made famous in the 1964 musical starring Julie Andrews.  Scenes showed Mary Poppins floating from the skies holding a kite, pulling an umbrella out of her magic bottomless bag and riding in a car with lamplighter Jack (Lin-Manuel Miranda) in a part-animated sequence echoing the original film.

In one case, someone who ate one of the hot dogs suffered a  minor oral injury,  the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service said in a statement.  That was the only reported incidence of injury or illness connected with the products, produced by Marathon Enterprises Inc.'s meat-processing plant in New York's Bronx borough.  The franks were sold nationwide to retailers and institutions, mostly under the Sabrett brand name, the USDA said.  As a fourth-generation, family-owned company, Sabrett takes its responsibility to provide safe foods very seriously with a robust internal food safety program,  Marathon said in a statement posted on its website.  Sabrett deeply regrets any concern or inconvenience this has caused its loyal customers.  Sabrett hot dogs have been a fixture of the New York City area for decades, sold by street-corner vendors from pushcarts adorned with blue and yellow umbrellas.  The issue came to the attention of the USDA last week when consumers reported finding small pieces of bone and cartilage in the meat, the USDA and the company said.  The meat in question was produced between March 17 and July 4, with a sell-by date ranging from June 19 to October 6, 2017. In making the meat subject to a Class 1 recall, the USDA considers the meat to be a health hazard that presents a  reasonable probability  of causing  serious, adverse health consequences or death,  if consumed, according to its statement. But the Englewood, N.J. company said in its statement the recall was made out of  an abundance of caution.

A sea of rapturous, flag-waving crowds gathered in Istanbul to listen as a defiant Erdogan promised to punish his enemies and praised the unarmed civilians who last year stood up to the rogue soldiers and their tanks.  They showed no mercy when they pointed their guns at my people,  Erdogan said.  What did my people have? They had their flags - just as they do today - and something much more important: They had their faith.  Some 250 people were killed and parliament was bombed before the coup was put down. The show of popular defiance has likely ended decades of military interference in Turkish politics.  But along with a groundswell of nationalism, the coup's greatest legacy has been a far-reaching crackdown that has deepened the divide between Western-facing, secular Turks and the pious millions who back Erdogan's Islamist-rooted politics. Some 150,000 people have been sacked or suspended from jobs in the civil service and private sector and more than 50,000 detained for alleged links to the putsch. On Friday, the government said it had dismissed 7,000 more police, civil servants and academics for suspected links to the Muslim cleric it blames for the attempted coup.  Nobody who betrays this nation can remain unpunished,  Erdogan said, promising again to restore the death penalty if parliament votes to bring it back - a move that would all but end Turkey's bid to join the European Union.  Critics, including rights groups and some Western governments, say that Erdogan is using the state of emergency introduced after the coup to target opposition figures including rights activists, pro-Kurdish politicians and journalists.  The two co-leaders of the pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) are in jail - as are local members of rights group Amnesty International and nearly 160 journalists, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. 'Justice Destroyed' At a parliamentary ceremony in Ankara on Saturday, the head of the main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) decried what he said was the erosion of democracy following the coup.  Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan addresses his supporters during a ceremony marking the first anniversary of the attempted coup at the Presidential Palace in Ankara, Turkey July 16, 2017. Yasin Bulbul/Presidential Palace/Handout via REUTERS This parliament, which withstood bombs, has been rendered obsolete and its authority removed,  said Kemal Kilicdaroglu, in a reference to an April referendum that Erdogan narrowly won, giving him sweeping executive powers.  In the past year, justice has been destroyed. Instead of rapid normalization, a permanent state of emergency has been implemented.  Kilicdaroglu this month finished a 25-day, 425 km (265 mile)  justice march  from Ankara to Istanbul, to protest the detention of a CHP lawmaker. The march, although largely ignored by the pro-government media, culminated in a massive rally in Istanbul against the crackdown. The U.S. State Department lauded Turks for defending their democracy, but cautioned about the need to preserve basic freedoms. Slideshow (26 Images) More voices, not fewer, are necessary in challenging times,  it said in a statement. Thousands March In Istanbul, hundreds of thousands gathered to listen to Erdogan near the bridge spanning the Bosphorus - the spot where last year civilians confronted the tanks and troops who had halted traffic between the city's European and Asian sides. Roads near the bridge - since renamed  July 15 Martyrs' Bridge  - were so crowded that some people opted to come by ferry. Some in the crowd carried posters of those who died. Erdogan was also due to speak at parliament in the early hours on Sunday, to observe the precise minute that the putschists bombed the national assembly building. In the run-up to the anniversary, Turkish media has been saturated by coverage from the coup attempt, with some channels showing almost constant footage of young men and headscarved mothers facing down armed soldiers and tanks. One man, 20-year-old Ismet Dogan, said he and his friends took to the streets, heeding the call from Erdogan to defy the soldiers. He was shot in both legs, he told broadcaster TRT Haber.  My friends and I said, 'We have one nation, if we are to die, let's do it like men',  he said.  Everyone who was there with me had come there to die. Nobody was afraid of death.

The elevation of Chen, a trusted confidant of Xi, is a sign the president is flexing his political muscles as he maneuvers to line up a new Politburo Standing Committee, the apex of political power in China. Chen previously worked under Xi in Zhejiang province, where Xi was then provincial party leader, and has since ridden the coat-tails of his former boss, climbing rapidly through the party ranks. Foreign diplomats who have met Chen say he talks  openly about his closeness to Xi. Chen, who moves to Chongqing from the poor southwestern province of Guizhou, takes over from Sun Zhengcai, the official news agency Xinhua said, without saying where Sun would go next or including wording to suggest he would get another position. Chongqing television's main evening news showed Chen giving a speech to senior city officials, telling them he would not let down the party's trust in giving him such an important job. His predecessor Sun did not appear to be present in the meeting. Chongqing is perhaps best known for its association with its disgraced former party boss Bo Xilai, once himself a contender for top leadership before being jailed for life in 2013 in a dramatic corruption scandal. Chen said officials must  resolutely eliminate the malign influence  of the Bo case, Chongqing television reported. Sun had been seen as another potential candidate for elevation at the autumn congress, but his star has waned. Sources with ties to the leadership and foreign diplomats say Sun has been out of favor after the party's anti-corruption watchdog this year criticized Chongqing authorities for not doing enough to root out Bo's influence. Chen was made Guizhou deputy party secretary in 2012, but was promoted to governor less than a year later and within roughly a month of Xi becoming president, before moving up again to his role as Guizhou party boss in 2015. Sources with ties to the leadership had said Chen could jump straight into the Standing Committee with Xi's support potentially easing out contenders from rival factions, though Chen is still considered a dark horse candidate. The switch from Guizhou to the more high-profile Chongqing role signals that Chen is virtually assured of a Politburo spot. But the change so close to the 19th Party Congress may mean he has to wait longer for further promotion, as it would be unusual to move the holder of such an important post within months.

Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt imposed sanctions on Qatar on June 5, accusing it of financing extremist groups and allying with the Gulf Arab states' arch-foe Iran. Doha denies the accusations.   France calls for the lifting, as soon as possible, of the measures that affect the populations in particular, bi-national families that have been separated or students,  French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told reporters in Doha, after he met his counterpart Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani. Le Drian was speaking alongside Sheikh Mohammed, hours after his arrival in Doha.  He is the latest Western official to visit the area since the crisis began.  Later in the day he flew to Jeddah, where he repeated his concerns about the effects of the standoff in a televised press appearance with Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir. Jubeir said any resolution of the worst Gulf crisis in years should come from within the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council.   We hope to resolve this crisis within the Gulf house, and we hope that wisdom prevails for our brothers in Qatar in order to respond to the demands of the international community - not just of the four countries,  he said. He reiterated that Qatar should not support terrorist groups and their financing or host their members and should end incitement through the media. Qatar has repeatedly denied such accusations and rejected demands to close down the Al Jazeera network as initially requested by the boycotting states. Le Drian, who will visit the UAE and Gulf mediator Kuwait on Sunday, follows in the steps of other world powers in the region, including the United States, whose Secretary of State Rex Tillerson sought to find a solution to the impasse this week. Officials from Britain and Germany also visited the region with the aim of easing the conflict, for which Kuwait has acted as mediator between the fending Gulf countries. In a joint statement issued after Tillerson and Sheikh Mohammed signed an agreement on Tuesday aimed at combating the financing of terrorism, the four Arab states leading the boycott on Qatar said the sanctions would remain in place.  They also reinstated 13 wide-ranging demands they had earlier submitted to Qatar, the world's biggest producer of liquefied natural gas, as a condition for removing sanctions.

In a court filing on Friday, the administration asked the justices to overturn Thursday's decision by a U.S. district judge in Hawaii, which limited the scope of the administration's temporary ban on refugees and travelers from six Muslim-majority countries. The latest round in the fight over Trump's March 6 executive order, which he says is needed to prevent terrorism attacks, began when the Supreme Court intervened last month to partially revive the two bans, which had been blocked by lower courts. The Supreme Court said then that the ban could take effect, but that people with a  bona fide relationship  to a U.S. person or entity could not be barred. The administration had narrowly interpreted that language, saying the ban would apply to grandparents and other family members, prompting the state of Hawaii to ask Hawaii-based U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson to expand the definition of who could be admitted. Trump banned travelers from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for 90 days, and refugees for 120 days. The Supreme Court has agreed to hear oral arguments in the fall over whether the ban violates the U.S. Constitution.

The moment of truth came in the 10th game when her opponent Venus Williams, 37 but playing with the energy of a teenager, threatened to cut loose after a captivating half hour of play. The Venezuela-born 23-year-old faced two set points on her own serve but held her nerve to win them both, before reeling off the next nine games against the seven-times grand slam champion, a player she idolized in her youth.  I was so excited to go out there and win, especially over somebody like a role model,  Muguruza told reporters following the 7-5 6-0 victory that brought her her second major title. With that comes the distinction of becoming the first player to beat both Venus and sister Serena in grand slam finals. That triumph over the younger Williams came at last year's French Open, which was followed by a dip in form that has transitioned from a gradual to a spectacular reversal over the past fortnight.   (It) is very hard to find a recipe to feel good fitness-wise, tennis-(wise), mentally. I think in this tournament I put everything together, which is very hard,  Muguruza said. One obvious new factor at the All England Club has been the addition to her entourage of Conchita Martinez in the absence of regular coach Sam Sumyk, whose wife is expecting a baby. The new champion met Martinez - who beat a 37-year-old Martina Navratilova in 1994 to become Spain's only previous Wimbledon women's singles winner - as she paraded with her trophy through the corridors beneath Centre Court. The pair embraced like family before being joined for a patriotic photo-op by Madrid-born four-times men's slam champion Manuel Santana, who lifted the Wimbledon crown in 1966.  Obviously, I like Conchita to be in my team because I have a great relation with her,  Muguruza said.  We were very excited ... - the coincidence of her (beating) Navratilova, me (beating) Venus.. was, like, awesome.  Did that mean winning the title without Sumyk had given Muguruza extra confidence?   No, definitely not... I was talking with him every day... We've done a very good job before.. I guess (him and Martinez) is a combination.  And the underlying message for her regular coach was laced with humor. Asked at courtside if she had anything to say to him, she held the trophy aloft and said:  Here it is.

NBC News, which did not identify the Russian-American lobbyist, said some U.S. officials suspected him of still having ties to Russian intelligence, something he denied to the network.  The Associated Press said the lobbyist, whom it identified as Rinat Akhmetshin, confirmed that he had attended the June 2016 meeting in New York's Trump Tower. A source familiar with the participants of the meeting confirmed to Reuters that Akhmetshin was in the room. The meeting appears to be the most tangible evidence of a connection between Trump's election campaign and Russia, a subject that has prompted investigations by congressional committees and a federal special counsel. Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and former campaign adviser Paul Manafort were also at the meeting, which the president's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., agreed to attend because he believed he could get damaging information about Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Trump Jr. did not mention Akhmetshin's presence when he released a series of emails about the meeting earlier this week.  Deeply Disturbing     Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, said the report about Akhmetshin  if accurate, adds another deeply disturbing fact about this secret meeting.  Akhmetshin was not available for comment on Friday. There was no answer at the door of his house in Washington. The White House had no immediate comment about the NBC News report of a Russian-American lobbyist at the meeting. Kushner's spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment, and Manafort's spokesman Jason Maloni said Manafort had no comment on the meeting. A former Trump campaign adviser, Michael Caputo, told reporters after he testified to the House Intelligence Committee in closed session on Friday that he had no contact with Russians and never heard of anyone in the campaign  talking with Russians.      Accusations by U.S. intelligence agencies that Moscow meddled in the election and colluded with the Trump campaign have dominated the Republican president's first months in office. Russia denies the allegations, and Trump says there was no collusion. The agencies said earlier this year that Russia sought to help Trump win the election by hacking private emails from Democratic Party officials and disseminating false information online. To help the White House deal with Russia-related investigations, Trump is hiring veteran Washington lawyer Ty Cobb, a source familiar with the matter said on Friday. Cobb's role is separate from Trump's outside legal team, led by New York lawyer Marc Kasowitz.  Akhmetshin has been accused in federal and state courts in the United States of engaging in hacking conspiracies, although the allegations were later withdrawn, according to court records.  In 2015, lawyers for the Russian mining company International Mineral Resources claimed in the U.S. District Court of the District of Columbia that Akhmetshin helped organize the hack, theft and dissemination of private documents. That case was dropped. The same company filed a lawsuit against Akhmetshin in the New York Supreme Court but withdrew it last year.  U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley described Akhmetshin in a letter to the Justice Department in March as  a former member of the Russian military intelligence services (GRU)  who was working to overturn the 2012  Magnitsky Act  of Congress, which blacklists Russians for human rights abuses. The Kremlin has often complained about the act.     Congressional records show that Akhmetshin lobbied Congress last year for the Human Rights Accountability Global Initiative Foundation, a Washington-based advocacy group that says it is working to lift laws that prevent U.S. residents from adopting Russian children. Those laws were put in place by Moscow in response to the Magnitsky Act. Trump told Reuters on Wednesday that he did not know about his son's meeting last year until recently. But in a conversation with reporters later that day, Trump said:  In fact, maybe (the meeting) was mentioned at some point,  adding that he was not told it was about Clinton.    Trump Jr.'s lawyer, Alan Futerfas, said he had talked with a person who came to the meeting between Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya and Trump aides.        He told me specifically he was not working for the Russian government, and in fact laughed when I asked him that question,  Futerfas told NBC News. It was not immediately clear if the person he referred to was Akhmetshin. The lawyer said Trump Jr. knew nothing about the man's background at the time of the meeting. The Russian lawyer in the meeting, Veselnitskaya, has said she was not working for Russian authorities, but she told The Wall Street Journal in an interview on Friday that she was meeting with Russian authorities regularly. She said she shared information about a U.S.-born fund manager who lobbied for passage of the Magnitsky Act with the Russian prosecutor general’s office, including with Prosecutor General Yuri Chaika, a top official appointed by the Kremlin, the Journal said.

Some coverage has pointed at trouble in the team,  highlighting Wolff's decision to attend a birthday party for Vettel after the German drove into Hamilton's car in Azerbaijan. Wolff said the driver -- who is 20 points behind Vettel after nine races -- had discussed everything with him and acted with full permission.  We had a chat at the beginning of the week whether it was good or not good to go to the event,  he said.  After five years together I think the most important is that he feels at ease because that is how he extracts performance on race weekends.

I give him freedom to organize his days in a way he wants. If he feels that staying away from a Formula One environment, being with his friends...helps him to extract performance in Silverstone then so be it.  Wolff said there had never been an issue within the team, and the driver was 'in a great place' even if he polarized opinion.

Chasing a record-equalling fifth British Grand Prix victory, and fourth in a row at Silverstone, he has enjoyed his annual  love-in with the home fans. Wolff suggested Red Bull boss Christian Horner had been up to  a bit of mischief  in highlighting Hamilton's absence at the London event, heard few boos and saw no backlash ahead of Sunday's race.  He took a decision for his championship and the way he's been treated in certain media is wrong,  said Wolff.  And not fair.  Before his home race at Silverstone, after rough weekends in Austria and Baku, to be treating the local superstar and hero in that way is absolutely against how I see things.

Astana rider Aru was far from the front of the peloton when they reached the bottom of the final climb, a 600-metre effort at an average gradient of 9.6 per cent, and lost a massive 24 seconds to Froome. Froome now leads Aru by 19 seconds and third-placed Romain Bardet of France by 23.  It looked like Aru was suffering he had no team mate around him,  LeMond, who is on the Tour as an analyst for Eurosport, said in his daily chat with Reuters.  It looks like he is tired and the team is not doing good either.  Aru was way back coming into the last 2km, I couldn't believe he wasn't up front. He lost quite a bit of time for nothing.  Aru, however, could be happy that he does not have the pressure of wearing the leader's jersey.  The pressure is off now that he does not have the yellow jersey. The yellow jersey does something to you. It's a lot of requests,  said LeMond, who won the Tour in 1986, 1989 and 1990. The yellow jersey holder has an obligation to go through a mixed zone and to hold a news conference after the stage, the whole process usually taking at least an hour. Aru, however, remains a formidable opponent with next week's Alpine stages suited to his climbing abilities. But Sunday's 189.5-km effort through the Massif Central will be hard to control and team work should be crucial. With key team mates Jakob Fuglsang and Dario Cataldo out of the race injured, Aru is more exposed than Froome or Bardet.  If I was Sky and I saw Aru today, I would go right from the gun tomorrow and see what happens,  said LeMond.  There is one climb right away so I'd go with Michal Kwiatkowski, Mikel Landa and Chris Froome and see what happens.

He had his fourth straight quality start and has gone 3-1 with four earned runs in 27 innings during that span. Gray has been the subject of trade rumors for weeks, and less than hour before first pitch Gray heard about a Tweet out of Chicago that he had been scratched from his scheduled start against Cleveland. Gray, as well as family members and friends who text messaged him, naturally wondered if he had been traded.  It's hard,  Gray said.  You get 50 text messages 45 minutes before the game and that's when you just try to put your phone away and go to a place where you can block everything out and get ready for the game. So that's kind of what I tried to do.  C Ryan Lavarnway was outrighted to Triple-A Nashville. Lavarnay was designated for assignment Saturday but cleared waivers. He went 0-for-2 in one game for the A's after being called up from Triple-A Nashville on July 5 after C Josh Phegley was placed on the paternity list. In 61 games for the Sounds before being called up, Lavarnay hit .274 with four homers and 20 RBIs. RHP Chris Bassitt is schedule to throw three innings with a target of 45 pitches for Triple-A Nashville in a rehab appearance on Sunday as he continues his recovery from Tommy John surgery. Bassitt went 0-2 with a 6.11 ERA in five starts last season before going on the disabled list then undergoing surgery on May 6, 2016. Bassitt was shut down from his rehab assignment once this year but is back on track. If he returns to the A's this season, it will likely be as a reliever. OF Rajai Davis went 2-for-3, scored two runs and hit his third home run of the season, a solo shot in the fifth inning of a 5-0 victory against the Cleveland Indians on Friday night at the Oakland Coliseum. Davis, who played for the Indians last season when they won the American League title but lost to the Chicago Cubs in the World Series, wasn't going to be in the starting lineup, but rookie OF Jaycob Brugman became ill, and Davis filled in.  When someone goes down like that, someone else gets an opportunity and Rajai made the best of it,  A's manager Bob Melvin said. Davis snapped a career-long , 31-game streak without an RBI. 1B Yonder Alonso hit his 21st home run of the season on Friday night in a 5-0 victory against Cleveland.  With two outs in the fifth inning, Alonso hit a solo shot to right-center field off Indians RHP Carlos Carrasco. Alonso, Oakland's only representative at the All-Star Game on Tuesday, is batting .275 with 14 doubles and 44 RBIs.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-athletics-playerwatch-idUSMTZED7F55XP5C"},

After producing, as she has done throughout the tournament, clean-hitting and focused tennis, Williams failed to convert two set points at 5-4 and dramatically lost the next nine games as her hopes of a sixth Wimbledon singles title evaporated. The manner of her defeat inevitably led to speculation that the 37-year-old may have had a physical problem that stopped her from competing with the effectiveness she had shown in earlier rounds. In 2011, Williams was diagnosed with Sjogren's syndrome, an autoimmune disease that causes fatigue and joint pain but asked, at the post-match news conference whether that was a factor in her loss, she deflected the question, clearly not wishing to take away credit from her Spanish opponent.  She played really well. I mean, she played top tennis, so I have to give her credit for just playing a better match,  Williams said.  I've had a great two weeks. I'm looking forward to the rest of the summer,  she added. Later the American was asked how to explain the huge difference in the levels of her play in the first and second sets.  There's errors and you can't make them. You can't make them. I went for some big shots and they didn't land. Probably have to make less errors,  she said.

Williams offered little in the way of comment or explanation for her defeat in her short answers but did say her run to the final, which included a semi-final win over Britain's Johanna Konta, had taken a lot of effort.

It took a lot of effort and what-have-you to get right here today. So this is where I want to be every single major,  she said. Williams had arrived at Wimbledon under something of a cloud following her involvement in a fatal car accident. After winning her first-round match against Belgian Elise Mertens in straight sets, she broke down in tears in her news conference saying the incident had been  devastating . Last week Florida police said Williams was acting lawfully when she drove her sports utility vehicle into an intersection before a fatal crash with another car on June 9. Jerome Barson, 78, who was a passenger in a sedan that collided with the vehicle Williams was driving, was fatally injured. His family filed a wrongful death suit against Williams.

Mali's government has delayed the vote, which was originally planned for last week, but still plans to go ahead with it this year. Activists are unsettled by provisions that would enable the president to nominate a quarter of the Senate and remove the prime minister at will. Malians have become increasingly disillusioned with Keita's government, as insecurity has worsened significantly over the past year and is spreading beyond the desert north to the south and center, including the capital Bamako.  We don't need a revised constitution. We need the state to liberate the north and center of Mali and to take account of people's aspirations,  protester and local councillor Sonore Sidibe said at the march, where protesters held up placards saying 'no' to the constitution, and some brandished red cards and called for the president to resign. Presidential elections are scheduled for late 2018, although Keita has not said whether or not he will run. The constitutional changes concerning new regions are supposed to happen as part of a 2015 peace deal aiming to end the separatist Tuareg movement. It will also recognize their claims to a degree of autonomy by officially labeling the northern desert regions by their Tuareg name, 'Azawad'.  Some Malians are angered about concessions to the rebels, whose 2012 uprising enabled allied jihadists to take over parts of the north and use them as a launch pad for regional attacks. French forces intervened and scattered the Islamists and Tuareg rebels the following year.  This constitution is heading towards federalism,  said demonstrator Moussa Ouattara.  That's a victory to the separatists who want an Islamic Republic of Azawad . The peace deal has so far failed to quell unrest in the north, where rival pro and anti-government factions are locked in a violent power struggle.

There are some that moan all the time,  Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff told reporters.  If Romain Grosjean comes out and starts asking for penalties for other drivers, he'd rather look at his track record. He should be happy he's driving in Formula One,  added the Austrian. Grosjean has a chequered record in Formula One, famously dubbed a 'first lap nutcase' by now-retired Australian Mark Webber in an accident-filled 2012 season that led to him serving a one-race suspension. His speed and talents have since come to the fore and he is now a leading light in the Grand Prix Drivers' Association (GPDA). Triple world champion Hamilton qualified on pole position for his home grand prix by more than half a second in a stellar display of dominance. He had some anxious moments after the chequered flag, however, as stewards investigated the Haas driver's complaints. They decided after examining video evidence to take no further action, ruling that while Grosjean  may potentially have been affected  by Hamilton's presence at turn 16, he was not impeded. Grosjean was surprised by the wording and by the stewards making their decision without listening to his side of the story. He added that he had been handed a five-place grid penalty in China for slowing insufficiently when yellow warning flags were being waved but on Saturday had lost position with no penalty to anyone else.  If losing three and a half to four tenths is not being impeded, I am very surprised at what is,  Grosjean told reporters.  I think it opens room for a mess in qualifying and the rules are pretty clear.  I know that there is a world title going on at the front, but we are in a position where we fight as hard as the boys at the front and I was impeded today. Maybe if it was another driver there would have been something,  he added.  It does feel as though there are two types of decision.  Asked whether he felt Hamilton was benefiting from home race advantage, Grosjean refused to rise to the bait.  I am just saying that I have seen drivers impeding other drivers and get a penalty. Today, I was impeded. It was clear on the data, and nothing happened,  he said. Hamilton said immediately after qualifying that he had yet to see the replays, but apologized if he had done anything wrong.

She had bustled her way -- an infant in her arms -- through several other women telling reporters their husbands had been arrested on false grounds.

U.N. investigators who interviewed refugees said allegations of gang rape, torture, arson and killings by security forces in the operation were likely crimes against humanity. Myanmar's government, led by Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, has denied most of the claims, and is blocking entry to a U.N. fact-finding mission tasked with looking into the allegations. The government has also kept independent journalists and human rights monitors out of the area for the past nine months.

They were taken to Kyar Gaung Taung, one of three settlements requested by the journalists. Officials cited time constraints for the limited access.

Kyar Gaung Taung resident Sarbeda, 30, had been able to visit her son, Nawsee Mullah, 14, at a police camp where he is being held separately from adult detainees. She was not sure if he had a lawyer, she said. Reuters reported in March that 13 boys under the age of 18 were detained during security operations. They were included in a list of 423 people charged under the colonial-era Unlawful Associations Act, which outlaws joining or aiding rebel groups. At least 32 people from Kyar Gaung Taung village had been arrested and 10 killed, said a village schoolteacher, who asked not to be named for fear of reprisals. He estimated that half the village's 6,000 residents had fled during the clearance operation. Slideshow (5 Images)Burned to Death Another villager, Lalmuti, 23, pointed to a small pile of ashes where she said she found her father's remains. She described how he was bound and thrown into a house and burned to death. Her mother was later arrested when authorities deemed her complaint about the killings to be fabricated. She is serving a six-month jail sentence, Lalmuti and two other villagers said. Reporters were not given a chance to put these allegations to authorities, and Reuters was unable to reach officials to confirm the details of the cases by phone. In a press briefing on Friday, Brigadier General Thura San Lwin, commander of Myanmar's Border Guard Police, said some villagers had made what he said were erroneous claims and were subsequently charged and jailed for lying to the authorities.  The media said we torched houses and that there were rape cases -- they give wrong information,  Thura San Lwin told reporters. He also disputed the U.N.'s estimates for the number of people who fled, claiming local records showed that only 22,000 people were missing in the conflict. Myanmar officials say a domestic investigation, led by Vice President Myint Swe - a former lieutenant general in the army - and a commission headed for former U.N. chief Kofi Annan - which is not mandated to investigate human rights abuses - are the appropriate ways to address problems in Rakhine State.

Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has planned for a vote next week on revised legislation, unveiled on Thursday, and he has his work cut out for him in the coming days to get the 50  yes  votes needed for passage. Republicans control the Senate by a 52-48 margin and cannot afford to lose more than two from within their ranks because of united Democratic opposition, but two Republican senators already have declared opposition.  After all of these years of suffering thru Obamacare, Republican Senators must come through as they have promised,  Trump, who made gutting Obamacare one of his central campaign promises last year, wrote on Twitter from Paris, where he attended Bastille Day celebrations. The top U.S. doctors' group, the American Medical Association, on Friday called the new bill inadequate and said more bipartisan collaboration is needed in the months ahead to improve the delivery and financing of healthcare. Hospital and medical advocacy groups also have criticized the bill.  The revised bill does not address the key concerns of physicians and patients regarding proposed Medicaid cuts and inadequate subsidies that will result in millions of Americans losing health insurance coverage,  AMA President Dr. David Barbe said, referring to the government insurance program for the poor and disabled. A major test for McConnell's legislation expected early next week is an analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which last month forecast that the prior version of the bill would have resulted in 22 million Americans losing  insurance over the next decade. Related CoverageU.S. health insurers want Cruz proposal dropped from Senate billA day after that CBO analysis was issued, McConnell postponed a planned vote on the legislation because of a revolt within his own party, including moderates and hard-line conservatives. While the bill's prospects may look precarious, the same could have been said of healthcare legislation that ultimately was passed by the House of Representatives. Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan called off a vote in March in the face of a rebellion involving the disparate factions of the party but managed to coax enough lawmakers to back it and engineered narrow approval on May 4. Pence Seeks Support Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) speaks with reporters about the Senate health care bill on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., July 12, 2017.Aaron P. BernsteinVice President Mike Pence sought to shore up support among the nation's governors at a meeting in Rhode Island, but a key Republican governor, Ohio's John Kasich, came out strongly against the revised bill, saying its Medicaid cuts were too deep and it does too little to stabilize the insurance market. Kasich's opposition could put pressure on Rob Portman, a  Republican senator from Ohio, who has not yet taken a position on the bill. If the current Senate legislation collapses, some lawmakers have raised the possibility of seeking bipartisan legislation to fix parts of Obamacare but leaving intact the structure of the Affordable Care Act, Democratic former President Barack Obama's signature legislative achievement, commonly known as Obamacare. U.S. Senator Susan Collins (R-ME) (C) departs after a Senate Republican caucus meeting about an expected unveiling of Senate Republicans' revamped proposal to replace Obamacare health care legislation at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, U.S. July 13, 2017.Jonathan Ernst There are changes that need to be made to the law,  Dick Durbin, the No. 2 Senate Democrat, told MSNBC, citing  a bipartisan appetite to tackle this issue.  Moderate Susan Collins and conservative Rand Paul already oppose the revised Senate bill. Other Republican senators have either expressed concern or remained noncommittal, including Portman, Mike Lee, Shelley Moore Capito, John McCain, Dean Heller, John Hoeven, Lisa Murkowski, Jeff Flake, Ben Sasse, Cory Gardner, Todd Young and Thom Tillis. Republican Senators Lindsey Graham and Bill Cassidy floated an alternative plan. The new version was crafted to satisfy the Republican Party's various elements, including moderates worried about Americans who would be left without medical coverage and hard-line conservatives who demand less government regulation of health insurance. A provision championed by Republican Senator Ted Cruz and aimed at attracting conservatives would let insurers sell cheap, bare-bones insurance policies that would not have to cover broad benefits mandated under Obamacare. But two major health insurance groups, America's Health Insurance Plans and the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, called on McConnell to drop the Cruz proposal, saying it would undermine protections for pre-existing medical conditions, raise insurance premiums and destabilize the individual insurance market. The bill retained certain Obamacare taxes on the wealthy that the earlier version would have eliminated, a step moderates could embrace. But it kept the core of the earlier bill, including ending the expansion of Medicaid that was instrumental in enabling Obamacare to expand coverage to 20 million people, and restructuring that social safety-net program. John Thune, a member of the Senate Republican leadership, said in order to complete work on the bill by the end of next week, Senate leaders would have to try to formally begin debate on Tuesday or Wednesday, a move that requires a majority vote.

The election of French President Emmanuel Macron had put reform of the EU on the table, meaning Britain and the EU could meet  halfway  to strike a deal that would keep Britain inside the world's largest trading area, Blair said.  The European leaders, certainly from my discussions, are willing to consider changes to accommodate Britain, including around freedom of movement,  the former Labour prime minister said in an article published by his Institute for Global Change.  The opposition to free movement of people, once you break it down, is much more nuanced. The French and Germans share some of the British worries, notably around immigration, and would compromise on freedom of movement.  Blair's comments are at odds with the EU's negotiating stance, which stresses there can be no  cherry picking  from the benefits of membership of the EU's single market without accepting freedom of movement for EU workers. In a separate interview, Blair said he thought it was possible that Britain could stay in the EU because public opinion was moving against Brexit.  I think it's absolutely necessary that it doesn't happen because I think every day is bringing us fresh evidence that it's doing us damage economically,  Blair said, in a preview of Sky News' Sophy Ridge on Sunday program. The pro-Brexit Leave Means Leave campaign said Blair's comments showed how out of touch he is with voters. Reopen the Debate? Many Western EU leaders are indeed concerned to limit free movement only to workers - as specified in the EU treaty. Germany has won a series of EU court cases denying benefits and residence rights to immigrants who were not working.  There is little appetite in the bloc for reopening a negotiation with Britain that it already had before the Brexit referendum - partly because many in the EU see Britain's problems with EU immigration as partly of its own making. Under Blair's government, citizens of Poland and other ex-communist states were allowed to settle immediately in Britain, despite a years-long transition period allowed under EU rules.  When former prime minister David Cameron made cutting EU immigration the focus of a deal he demanded before holding the referendum last year, other European governments argued London could do more within existing EU rules to limit arrivals.  They nonetheless agreed to a special deal for Cameron to give Britain special rights to curb EU immigration, but that deal was rendered moot by the Brexit vote.  In his article on Saturday, Blair lamented that both Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservative Party and the opposition Labour Party had set their minds on leaving the single market, without exploring the alternatives.  Given what is at stake, and what, daily, we are discovering about the costs of Brexit, how can it be right deliberately to take off the table the option of compromise between Britain and Europe so that Britain stays within a reformed Europe?  he said. Blair praised the current leader of the Labour Party, left-winger Jeremy Corbyn, for mobilizing young voters in last month's general election in which May lost her majority in parliament. But Britain under a Corbyn-led government could  hit the canvas, flat on our back  if it adopted hard-left economics, Blair said.  In response, Corbyn told BBC News that the economy would do well under a Labour-led government that focused on raising investment. Blair was prime minister for 10 years until 2007. He wanted to take Britain into the euro zone and believed Britain should lead the way in the EU rather than withdraw from it.

The gathering in parliament was one of the first in a string of events planned through the weekend to commemorate the night of July 15, when thousands of unarmed civilians took to the streets to defy rogue soldiers who commandeered tanks and warplanes and bombed parliament in an attempt to seize power. More than 240 people died before the coup was put down, a show of popular defiance that has likely ended decades of military interference in Turkish politics. But along with a groundswell of nationalism, the coup's greatest legacy has been the far-reaching crackdown. Some 150,000 people have been sacked or suspended from jobs in the civil service and private sector and more than 50,000 detained for alleged links to the putsch. On Friday, the government said it had dismissed another 7,000 police, civil servants and academics for suspected links to the Muslim cleric it blames for the putsch.  Our people did not leave sovereignty to their enemies and took hold of democracy to the death,  Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said, as Erdogan and members of opposition parties looked on.  These monsters will surely receive the heaviest punishment they can within the law.  Critics, including rights groups and some Western governments, say that Erdogan is using the state of emergency introduced after the coup to target opposition figures including rights activists, pro-Kurdish politicians and journalists. The pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) was represented by its deputy chairman as the party's two co-leaders are in jail - as are local members of rights group Amnesty International and nearly 160 journalists, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. 'Justice Destroyed' At the parliamentary ceremony, the head of the main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) decried what he said was the erosion of democracy following the coup.  This parliament, which withstood bombs, has been rendered obsolete and its authority removed,  said Kemal Kilicdaroglu, in a reference to an April referendum that Erdogan narrowly won, giving him sweeping executive powers.  In the past year, justice has been destroyed. Instead of rapid normalisation, a permanent state of emergency has been implemented.  Kilicdaroglu this month finished a 25-day, 425 km (265 mile)  justice march  from Ankara to Istanbul, to protest the detention of a CHP lawmaker. The march, although largely ignored by the pro-government media, culminated in a massive rally in Istanbul against the crackdown. In the run-up to the anniversary of July 15, Turkish media has been saturated by coverage from last year's coup, with some channels showing almost constant footage of young men and even headscarved mothers facing down armed soldiers and tanks in Istanbul. One man, 20-year-old Ismet Dogan, said he and his friends took to the streets of Istanbul the night of the coup after they heard the call from Erdogan to defy the soldiers. He was shot in both legs by soldiers, he told the website of broadcaster TRT Haber.  My friends and I said, 'We have one nation, if we are to die, let's do it like men',  he said.  Everyone who was there with me had come there to die. Nobody was afraid of death.

Flights are also scheduled to and from Tunis, Istanbul, Alexandria, and the western Libyan city of Zintan.

Benina is just east of Benghazi, Libya's second city, where fighting escalated in the summer of 2014 when forces loyal to eastern-based commander Khalifa Haftar launched a military campaign against Islamists and other opponents. Earlier this month, Haftar declared victory in the campaign as his forces battled rivals in their last downtown holdouts.  Travelers and airport staff expressed relief at no longer having to travel to Labraq airport, a four-hour drive east of Benghazi, which had replaced Benina as the main airport for the eastern part of the country.  In recent months, some official and cargo flights had already been flying from Benina. There is also a military airport at Benina, which continued operating throughout the conflict as Haftar's forces targeted their rivals with air strikes.  Tripoli's international airport was badly damaged by fighting in 2014, and flights have since operated out of the smaller Mitiga airport near the center of the capital.

The Swiss, level with Britain's William Renshaw and American Pete Sampras on seven titles, is rejuvenated after taking a six-month break last year and enters the final as the clear favorite having not dropped a set in the tournament.  Add in the fact he has been almost unstoppable this season, winning four of the six events he had entered - including an 18th grand slam title at the Australian Open in January - many pundits and rivals believe Federer is playing some of his best tennis this year. While Cilic will be contesting his first final at the All England Club, this will be a record 11th appearance for Federer and, less than a month short of his 36th birthday, he is the oldest Wimbledon finalist since Ken Rosewall finished runner-up in 1974 aged 39.  Should he triumph, Federer will become the oldest winner of the Challenge Cup since tennis turned professional in 1968.  It makes me really happy, making history here at Wimbledon. It's a big deal. I love this tournament,  Federer said after another vintage performance dealt with Czech Tomas Berdych in the semi-final.

Eleven finals here, all these records, it's great. But it doesn't give me the title quite yet. That's why I came here this year. I'm so close now, so I have just got to stay focused.

In seven meetings with the tall Croat, Federer has lost just once - in the semi-final of the 2014 U.S. Open when Cilic went on to win the title. In last year's Wimbledon quarter-final, Federer needed five sets and saved three match points to get past Cilic and that should give the Croatian some hope.  I was one point away from winning a match over here against him. Definitely I believe in my own abilities to get through and to win it,  the 28-year-old said after beating American Sam Querrey in the semis.  But I still know that it's a big mountain to climb. Roger is playing maybe some of the best tennis of his career at the moment, having a great season. So I know it's going to be a huge challenge. But I believe I'm ready .

Firefighters sprayed water onto the flames from nearby balconies and brought them under control at about 6.30 p.m. local time (0430 GMT Saturday), fours hours after the fire began, Honolulu Mayor Kirk Caldwell told reporters.

I heard three women's voices screaming, pleading, moaning, 'Please help me, please' continuous screaming for five or ten minutes, and then I didn't hear anymore.

At least 12 other people were injured, it added. Fire Chief Manuel Neves told reporters that the building did not have a sprinkler system.  Without a doubt if there was sprinklers in this apartment, the fire would be contained to the unit of origin ... the unit (where) the fire started,  he said.

An Egyptian man stabbed the two German tourists to death and wounded at least four others on Friday at a popular seaside vacation spot on the Red Sea, officials and witnesses said. The knifeman killed the two German women and wounded two other tourists at the Zahabia hotel in Hurghada, then swam to a neighboring beach to attack at least two more people at the Sunny Days El Palacio resort before being caught by staff and arrested, officials and security sources said. It was the first major attack on foreign tourists since a similar assault on the same resort more than a year ago, and comes as Egypt struggles to revive a tourism industry hurt by security threats and years of political upheaval.  We now have the sad certainty that two German women were killed in the attack in Hurghada,  a German Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said.  According to what we know, the act was a deliberate attack on foreign tourists - a particularly devious and criminal act that leaves us sad, dismayed and furious,  she added. Sources close to the investigation told Reuters the attacker was taken to Cairo for questioning by prosecutors after officers from Egypt's domestic security agency conducted an initial inquiry.  The suspect, from a village in the southern Kafr al-Sheikh province, arrived in Hurghada at 5 a.m. on Friday in a public bus and waited until shops opened before buying a knife, the sources said.

A security official at the El Palacio hotel told Reuters two of the injured were Czech and two Armenian, but other officials said one of the women was Russian. They were being treated at a local hospital. The Czech Foreign Ministry tweeted that one Czech woman had sustained a minor leg injury.

Three military sources blamed demobilized former rebel fighters - forces caught up in years of instability in Francophone West Africa's most important economy - though no group claimed responsibility.  There was an attack overnight at Abobo (north Abidjan), but there were no deaths. In Korhogo, three of the assailants were killed,  Colonel Zakaria Kone, commander of the Abobo camp, told Reuters by telephone.  The situation is now calm.  He added that a police station in Abobo was also attacked, saying he did not know who had done it or for what motive.  The three military sources in the northern city of Bouake, which sent reinforcements to Korhogo, said the attackers were demobilized fighters from former rebels who controlled the north of the country during Ivory Coast's crisis from 2002 to 2011. During that period, northern rebels hostile to then president Laurent Gbagbo seized half the country. An election meant to end the crisis instead triggered a short civil war when Gbagbo refused to concede to President Alassane Ouattara. Sporadic unrest since then has revealed just how precarious security still is in Ivory Coast, the world's leading cocoa producer, six years since the war killed thousands of people. Security has been particularly tense since soldiers made up mostly of former rebels that had backed Ouattara during the crisis mutinied in January. The 8,400 troops involved demanded bonuses they claimed they were owed and were partly paid in order to put it to rest.  But they mutinied again in May, and were paid the remainder of what they had demanded in a deal that risks both angering other factions in the military and encouraging other former rebel fighters to take up arms.

The seventh round of talks, which ended on Friday, had produced positive results, especially a  correction  in the approach of the main opposition delegation, the Saudi-backed High Negotiations Committee, he said.   The essence of this correction is that during this round the opposition never once demanded the immediate resignation of President Bashar al-Assad and the legitimate Syrian government.  The HNC and its backers in Western and Gulf capitals had realized that peace needed to come first, and then political reforms could be negotiated, he said.  Assad must go  was long the mantra of the HNC and its international backers, a call flatly rejected by Russia, which is widely seen as holding the balance of power in Syria because of its military involvement and alliance with Assad. But over the past year the opposition suffered military defeats at the hands of forces loyal to Assad, and neither U.S. President Donald Trump nor French President Emmanuel Macron is calling for his immediate ouster. Assad's negotiators at the U.N. talks have avoided discussion of any kind of political transition, preferring to focus on the fight against terrorism. They have not yet had to negotiate directly with the opposition because there is no unified delegation to meet them, since the HNC and two other groups, known as the Cairo and Moscow platforms, all claim to represent the opposition.  In the seven rounds so far, U.N. mediator Staffan de Mistura has met each side separately, a laboriously choreographed negotiation that has succeeded only in deciding what to discuss: a new constitution, reformed governance, fresh elections and fighting terrorism. The three opposition delegations' leaders have been meeting to try to find common ground, raising hopes of direct talks at the next round in September. Borodavkin said the success of such a unified delegation would depend on its willingness to compromise with Assad's team.  If they will be ready to make deals with the government delegation, that is one thing. If they again slide into... ultimatums and preconditions that are not realistic, then this will not fly. This will lead the negotiations, be it direct or indirect, into a deadlock.  He also called for wider opposition representation, citing the Kurds as a striking example, since they were Syrian citizens with their own political and military influence. But he said it was up to de Mistura to decide how and when to incorporate them in the peace process.

Speaking at the National Financial Work Conference, Xi said China would set up a financial stability committee under the State Council, boost the People's Bank of China's (PBOC) role managing financial risks and create more cohesive regulation.  We will strengthen the PBOC's role in macro-prudential management and in averting systemic risk,  Xi said, adding the country would increase the accountability of regulators and the supervision over regulatory bodies. Ahead of the closed-door event, economists had widely expected the meeting to focus on how the central bank could better coordinate with the country's three main financial regulators to manage risk in the financial system. China's financial regulators are gathered in Beijing in a once-in-five-years huddle to discuss how better to tackle weakness in the financial system. The most recent meeting in 2012 yielded no significant policy change. The main regulators include the China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC), the China Securities Regulatory Commission and the China Insurance Regulatory Commission. Ahead of a leadership reshuffle in the autumn, Beijing has zeroed in on the stability of the economy and financial system, cracking down on risky behaviour by insurers and lenders, as well as targeting high levels of corporate debt. Investors have long supported the idea of a unified body to oversee the regulators that oversee the different parts of China's financial system, though there is little sign that a super-merger of the regulators is imminent. In 2015, a poorly coordinated response to a stock market crash in China drew scrutiny on the government's response. Premier Li Keqiang openly criticised the financial regulators as not responding sufficiently. In March this year, the new CBRC chief Guo Shuqing said the banking regulator was collaborating with other regulators to create a framework to close loopholes in rules for cross-market financial products.

Earlier this month, the U.S. State Department said it has approved the possible sale of seven Patriot missile defense systems worth $3.9 billion to Romania. A NATO member since 2004 and European Union member since 2007, Romania has committed to boost its defense spending to two percent of gross domestic product this year. Asked whether talk of acquiring Patriot missiles and recent military drills were straining relations with Russia, Iohannis told reporters:  Firstly, we must look at what these acquisitions are for.    We are not getting ready to attack anyone. We are preparing ... for our army to benefit from modern, efficient features. They are meant to defend us, to guarantee the security of Romanians.  Asked whether recent regional military exercises could deter Russia, Iohannis said  Of course they could, and I think they do so.  Russia, whose annexation of the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 prompted concern among NATO's eastern members such as Poland and the Baltic states, has said NATO was threatening stability in Eastern Europe by building up its military presence there and staging war games. A final decision by Romania to buy the missile defenses systems, whose prime contractors would be Raytheon Co and Lockheed Martin Corp, has yet to be announced by the country's defense ministry.

Liu, 61, died of multiple organ failure on Thursday in a hospital in the northeastern city of Shenyang, where he was being treated for late-stage liver cancer, having been given medical parole but not freed. He had been jailed for 11 years in 2009 for  inciting subversion of state power  after helping to write a petition known as  Charter 08  calling for sweeping political reforms. His widow, Liu Xia, has been under effective house arrest since her husband won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010, but had been allowed to visit him in prison about once a month. She has never been formally charged with any crime. Speaking at a government-arranged news conference, Liu Xiaobo's eldest brother Liu Xiaoguang offered thanks several times to the Communist Party for its thoughtful care considering the dissident's  special situation .  Why has Liu Xia not come here? Her health is very weak at the moment,  Liu Xiaoguang said, sitting in between an English-language interpreter and a Shenyang government official.  So she can't come here. It's very regretful.  After speaking for about 20 minutes, Liu was escorted out by two unidentified women, an unlit cigarette in his mouth, and did not answer questions from journalists who surrounded him. The government then showed reporters images of the ashes being scattered from a boat. City government information official Zhang Qingyang said Liu Xia and Liu Xiaoguang had decided upon the scattering of ashes at sea. Related CoverageAustralia urges China to release dissident Liu Xiaobo's widowBut close friend and fellow dissident Hu Jia said the motivation behind the sea burial was so that there was  nothing to remember him by on Chinese soil  and so that supporters could not create a shrine to pay tribute to him.   We know that Liu Xiaobo's home is Beijing, his spiritual home is here, his love was also found here,  he said. Hu said it was well-known among Liu's friends that his elder brother did not agree with his political views and that it was a cynical move for him to be presented to the media as representing Liu Xia and the family.   The extent to what the authorities are capable of always exceeds our imagination, they always have something worse than imagined planned,  Hu said of the news conference.  Crude, Cruel and Callous  A protester holds a defaced Chinese national flag with words  fascist kills Liu Xiaobo , as he mourns the death of Nobel laureate Liu Xiaobo, outside China's Liaison Office in Hong Kong, China July 15, 2017.Bobby YipNicholas Bequelin, Amnesty International's East Asia Regional Director, tweeted that the news conference was  one of the most crude, cruel and callous political show(s) I have ever witnessed . Government official Zhang, speaking earlier, said Liu's widow was  currently free , adding that as a Chinese citizen, her rights would be protected under the law.      But she just lost her spouse. She is extremely sad. In the period after dealing with the death of Liu Xiaobo, she won't take anymore outside disturbances. This is the wish of the family members. It's natural.  Zhang did not say where Liu Xia currently was. A government statement said Mozart's Requiem was played during the funeral, a work of music Mozart left unfinished on his death bed. Slideshow (8 Images)Liu family lawyer Mo Shaoping told Reuters he did not know whether the cremation was in accordance with family wishes, however, as they had been unreachable.  They are likely still to be under the watch and control of authorities,  Mo said.  They can't be contacted.  In funeral photographs handed out by the government, Liu Xia and other family members stand around the coffin containing Liu's body, surrounded by white flowers that signify mourning in China. During the past couple of weeks, Liu Xia had been at the hospital as her husband's health deteriorated. Rights groups and Western governments have mourned Liu Xiaobo's death and urged authorities to grant freedom of movement to his wife and the rest of his family. Several thousand people in Hong Kong held an evening vigil for Liu, holding up candles and white roses in a largely silent march to China's main representative office. Some carried banners calling Liu a  people's hero  and demanding Liu Xia be truly freed.  Even though he is dead, his fight and beliefs will never be forgotten,  said a 62-year-old marcher surnamed Wu.  We have to do something to commemorate him.   China has repeatedly attacked foreign governments for their concern about Liu and calls to allow Liu Xia to leave the country if she wishes, and foreign reporters in Shenyang have been closely monitored by plainclothes security. Efforts are being made to secure permission from Chinese authorities for Liu Xia and her brother Liu Hui to leave, a Western diplomat said on Friday. The last Nobel Peace Prize winner to live out his dying days under state surveillance was Carl von Ossietzky, a pacifist who died in Berlin in Nazi Germany in 1938.

Calling European Union membership one of Germany's biggest strengths, Merkel said last year's Brexit decision and elections in France and the Netherlands, in which pro-European parties defeated populist candidates, had changed her perspective.  For many people, including myself, something changed when we saw the Britons want to leave, when we were worried about the outcome of the elections in France and the Netherlands,  Merkel told voters, some of whom wore straw hats with black-red-and-gold hatbands, the colors of the German flag.

Many people in the past had taken the EU and its advantages for granted -- such as freedom of speech, freedom of religion and freedom to travel, said Merkel who grew up in communist East Germany.  You don't have all this in many parts of the world. And that's why it is worth fighting for this Europe,  Merkel said.  That's why one of our election placards is saying: If Europe is stronger, then Germany will be stronger. This is directly related.

An Egyptian man stabbed the two German tourists to death and wounded at least four others on Friday at a popular seaside vacation spot on the Red Sea, officials and witnesses said. The knifeman killed the two German women and wounded two other tourists at the Zahabia hotel in Hurghada, then swam to a neighboring beach to attack at least two more people at the Sunny Days El Palacio resort before being caught by staff and arrested, officials and security sources said. It was the first major attack on foreign tourists since a similar assault on the same resort more than a year ago, and comes as Egypt struggles to revive a tourism industry hurt by security threats and years of political upheaval.  We now have the sad certainty that two German women were killed in the attack in Hurghada,  a German Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said.  According to what we know, the act was a deliberate attack on foreign tourists - a particularly devious and criminal act that leaves us sad, dismayed and furious,  she added. Sources close to the investigation told Reuters the attacker was taken to Cairo for questioning by prosecutors after officers from Egypt's domestic security agency conducted an initial inquiry.  The suspect, from a village in the southern Kafr al-Sheikh province, arrived in Hurghada at 5 a.m. on Friday in a public bus and waited until shops opened before buying a knife, the sources said.

Coming off their most lopsided defeat of the season, the Rockies attempt to put an end to their recent losing ways Saturday when they play the second of three games in New York against the Mets. Colorado finished the first half with a 52-39 mark, although that record comes as a bit of a disappointment considering the team was 21 games over .500 as recently as June 20. The Rockies' early-season stellar pitching has fallen off dramatically, however, and the club that spent 67 days atop the National League West is in a tailspin that has seen it lose 14 of 19 after New York cruised to a 14-2 trimuph in Friday's series opener. Colorado's night nearly got a lot worse as Nolan Arenado left the game early with a hip injury after slipping on the bases, although manager Bud Black deemed the move to remove the All-Star third baseman  precautionary.

The 27-year-old, whose road ERA (3.19) is almost twice as low as it is at home (6.14), is winless in his last five turns overall and has issued 19 of his major-league high 57 walks over his last four outings. Chatwood has thrived against the Mets in his career, going 3-0 with a 1.50 ERA in five starts. Lugo will pitch at home for only the second time in seven games (six starts) Saturday and looks to improve on a shaky outing to open to July after going 3-1 with a 3.55 ERA in June. The former 34th-round draft pick permitted six runs over five innings at Washington on July 4 before allowing a solo homer over three relief innings at St. Louis five days later. Lugo was charged with two runs despite yielding only one hit and one walk over three relief frames last July in his first career appearance against the Rockies. Walk-Offs 1.

Marcell Ozuna is 6-for-20 and Giancarlo Stanton is 3-for-23 against Wood, who is 5-3 with 3.00 ERA in 12 games (nine starts) versus Miami. Urena capped off a fine first half with a disappointing no-decision Sunday at San Francisco, giving up three runs on five hits - including a pair of homers - over five innings. The 25-year-old Dominican has fallen off a bit since a five-game winning streak from May 23-June 23 (3.38 ERA), going 1-1 with a 4.50 ERA in three outings since. Urena has been dominant in three appearances (two starts) spanning 15 1/3 innings against the Dodgers, going 1-0 with a 0.59 ERA. Walk-Offs 1. The Dodgers are 53-18 since 1B-OF Cody Bellinger's promotion on April 25, and the club is 34-9 when he and fellow All-Star 3B Justin Turner are in the lineup together. 2. The Marlins' eight-game streak of collecting at least 10 hits - the second-longest in club history - came to an end Friday. 3. Puig already has more multi-homer games in 85 games this season (three) than he did in his first 435 games combined (one).

The Braves enter Saturday’s home contest against the Arizona Diamondbacks after Freeman made several nice plays at third base, and went 2-for-4 with two RBIs as Atlanta won for the 14th time in its past 22 games in Friday’s 4-3 victory. Freeman is 12-for-30 with three homers in seven games since coming off the disabled list to help the rebuilding Braves stay on the edge of the National League wild-card race. Arizona lost for the ninth time in its past 12 games despite getting Paul Goldschmidt’s 21st homer of the season and banging out 10 hits in the series opener, its highest total in the past 12 games.

He lost to Cincinnati on Sunday despite striking out nine and allowing only two runs in six innings. The 27-year-old looks to reverse a rough showing away from home in the first half when he went 1-6 with a 7.57 ERA. Foltynewicz showed why the Braves project him as a top-line starter, allowing only six runs across his last four starts while going 3-0 with a .217 opponents’ batting average.

Cleveland was unable to expand its 2 1/2-game lead over Minnesota in the American League Central as it managed only four hits in Friday's series-opening 5-0 setback. All-Star Jose Ramirez recorded a double for the Indians' lone extra-base hit and has hit safely in 11 of his last 12 contests. Oakland mustered just six hits itself, but it was enough for the club to post its third consecutive victory at home. Two of the Athletics' hits were solo homers by Rajai Davis and All-Star Yonder Alonso, who trails team leader Khris Davis (24) by three as he continues to shatter his previous career high of nine (2012).

Kluber improved to 2-4 in seven career appearances (six starts) versus Oakland when he gave up two hits and struck out 10 in six scoreless innings on June 1. Blackburn has been impressive during his first stint in the major leagues, allowing two runs - one earned - and 11 hits in 13 2/3 innings over two starts. The 23-year-old Californian is coming off his first career victory, a triumph at Seattle on July 6 in which he gave up one run and eight hits over 7 2/3 frames.

The Brewers - who own a 5 1/2-game division lead over the Chicago Cubs - rolled to victory on the strength of an eight-run second inning that was powered by Ryan Braun's sixth career grand slam, which put him ahead of Cecil Cooper, John Jaha and Jeromy Burnitz for the franchise lead.

The blaze at the 36-story Marco Polo condominium complex sent thick black smoke pouring over the city, a month to the day after a deadly high-rise fire in London. Firefighters sprayed water onto the flames from nearby balconies and brought them under control at about 6.30 p.m. local time (0430 GMT Saturday), fours hours after the fire began, Honolulu Mayor Kirk Caldwell told reporters.  I looked down I could see the billowing smoke coming up,  resident Ron Chiarottino said.  I heard three women's voices screaming, pleading, moaning, 'Please help me, please' continuous screaming for five or ten minutes, and then I didn't hear anymore.   The Honolulu Star-Advertiser newspaper said a mother and her adult son were among the three people who perished on the 26th floor, where the fire started. At least 12 other people were injured, it added. Fire Chief Manuel Neves told reporters that the building did not have a sprinkler system.  Without a doubt if there was sprinklers in this apartment, the fire would be contained to the unit of origin ... the unit (where) the fire started,  he said.   More than 100 firefighters tackled the fire and officers were conducting a room-by-room search, a task that could take several hours, he added.

Venus, aged 37 and undergoing a barely credible tennis renaissance, last stepped out onto Centre Court to contest a singles final in 2009. She lost that match to Serena Williams, having beaten her younger sister to lift the aptly named Venus Rosewater Dish the previous year - the most recent of her seven grand slam titles. Victory in Saturday's final - in which, with rain a possibility, the Wimbledon roof may come into play - would see the evergreen American surpass Serena as the oldest major title winner since the sport turned professional in 1968. Having finished runner-up in the Australian Open in January, Venus would also move to the top of the leaderboard as the best main tour player of 2017. Albeit on a less eye-catching scale, Muguruza is enjoying a comeback of her own. Tennis - Wimbledon - London, Britain - July 13, 2017   Spain’s Garbine Muguruza celebrates winning the semi final match against Slovakia’s Magdalena RybarikovaToby MelvilleHaving reached her first slam final at Wimbledon in 2015 and then gone one better in 2016 by winning the French Open - playing Serena both times - the form of the Venezuela-born 23-year-old dipped towards the end of last year. But since May she has made the semi-finals on the Rome clay - beating Venus in the last eight in three sets - and on the Birmingham grass. With both players boasting similar strengths and weaknesses, the older Williams has been open about picking Serena's brains  on how best to neutralize Muguruza's powerful serve and forehand, even joking this week that she wished her younger sister could play the match in her stead. En route to Saturday's final, for which bookies make the Spaniard the slight favorite, both players have dropped just one set. That means a decider could be on the cards, which history suggests would favor whoever starts best. Of grand slam contests in which they have taken the first set, Muguruza has lost just two of 42, and Williams 18 of 250.

Toyota said on March 16 it would install its new car platform at its Burnaston plant. One source, who is familiar with the letter, said that Toyota delayed the decision due by the end of December while it weighed up a number of factors including Brexit. The business ministry has confirmed the existence of a letter but refused to release it.  The source said the letter was similar to one sent to Japanese carmaker Nissan last year when it decided to build two new models at its northern English plant. The document sparked public and lawmaker concern about secretive deals. The source, who did not say when the letter was sent, said it contained several reassurances.   They received a similar set of warm words as Nissan on electric vehicles, commitment to further training and to ensure the competitiveness of the UK automotive industry,  the source said. A Toyota spokesman declined to comment on whether it had received such a letter. He referred to the company's March 16 statement which said the British government was providing funding for training and research and development. Toyota also said at the time that  continued tariff-and-barrier free market access... will be vital for future success.  Britain said in March it would back up the investment from Toyota, which builds roughly 10 percent of Britain's 1.7 million cars, by spending 21.3 million pounds to support skills and training, research and development and innovation, subject to an independent assessment. A spokesman at the business ministry declined to provide any comment for this story. Business minister Greg Clark said last year that assurances offered to Nissan were available to other firms. Reuters made a freedom of information (FOI) request to the business ministry to see documentation relating to the investment decision, which the ministry said included a letter. In its response, an official at the ministry refused to release the letter and a company briefing note, saying the information was  both highly commercially sensitive  and  would be likely to cause harm to the company's commercial interests if disclosed.  Clark has refused to publish the Nissan letter. He said he will release the information when it is no longer commercially confidential. FILE PHOTO: New cars are parked at Toyota's Burnaston plant near Derby, central England February 18, 2009.Darren Staples/File PhotoMany of the world's biggest car firms are worried about the long-term viability of their British plants and are using their upcoming investment decisions to push for promises to maintain free trade after Britain's exit from the EU, which is due to take place in March 2019. Redacted Emails Toyota finalised its decision at a meeting between its Europe President and Chief Executive Johan van Zyl and Clark on March 15, the day before the official announcement, a third source, who is close to the company told Reuters.  In response to the FOI request, the business ministry said there were three documents relating to discussions between the firm and top government officials since Clark was appointed in July last year: a letter, a confidential company briefing and an email exchange. Slideshow (2 Images)It initially refused to publish all three but after Reuters appealed the decision, the department released a redacted email exchange. Reuters asked for correspondence between the company and Clark, a special advisor, a junior minister and the ministry's automotive team. The email exchange included three messages which were written after a meeting between Clark and van Zyl. The emails are redacted so that it is not possible to know who received them.   We picked up from the recent meeting with Greg Clark that Toyota has a significant investment decision coming up before the end of the year, for a new European 'architecture plant',  according to official correspondence dated Sep. 9.   Dr Zyl noted that uncertainties over future trade arrangements are a worry, and SofS (Secretary of State Clark) sought to reassure on the alignment of company and HMG (Her Majesty's government) goals.    It would (be) great to understand more about the decision, and if there are any ways in which HMG could help,  the email from the official said. Clark had meetings with Toyota officials in September, November and March, according to an official government log.  Japan's Nissan, Toyota and Honda account for around half of British car output. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe met with British Prime Minister Theresa May in April and called for a smooth Brexit to allow Japanese firms to continue to operate.

Eugeniusz Gatnar told the newspaper he believes inflation may reach the central bank's target of an annual 2.5 percent faster than by the end of 2019 as envisioned in the bank's recent analysis, prompting a need to increase rates. Poland's 10-member rate-setting Monetary Policy Council has held the benchmark interest rate unchanged at an all-time low of 1.50 percent since a 50-basis-point cut in March 2015.  Reaching the inflation target would speak in favour of raising rates, but there are different reasons as well,  Gatnar said.   I'm concerned about the consequences of real interest rates staying negative for too long. We cannot allow a decimation of Polish people's savings, which are not big as they are.  Real interest rates are adjusted to remove the impact of inflation. If they stay negative for too long, the value of savings decreases.

Eugeniusz Gatnar told the newspaper he believes inflation may reach the central bank's target of an annual 2.5 percent faster than by the end of 2019 as envisioned in the bank's recent analysis, prompting a need to increase rates. Poland's 10-member rate-setting Monetary Policy Council has held the benchmark interest rate unchanged at an all-time low of 1.50 percent since a 50-basis-point cut in March 2015.  Reaching the inflation target would speak in favour of raising rates, but there are different reasons as well,  Gatnar said.   I'm concerned about the consequences of real interest rates staying negative for too long. We cannot allow a decimation of Polish people's savings, which are not big as they are.  Real interest rates are adjusted to remove the impact of inflation. If they stay negative for too long, the value of savings decreases.

The win might have been costly as Cueto exited the game with two fingers and a thumb on his pitching hand showing signs of blisters. Cueto might miss his next start, according to Giants manager Bruce Bochy.  You could tell he wasn't quite right,  Bochy said.  That was what kept him from going out there. After the fourth inning he said, 'I can't finish my pitches' so I had to make a move.'  Posey, who entered the game with two hits in his last 19 at-bats, produced a seventh-inning, 429-foot blast off reliever Ryan Buchter for his 11th homer on the year and his first since June 22. Posey had his first RBI when he singled in the game's initial run. Gorkys Hernandez had a career-high four hits to lead the Giants' 14-hit attack. Cory Gearrin (3-2), who relieved Cueto, secured the win after pitching a scoreless inning. Related CoveragePreview: Giants at PadresSan Francisco Giants - PlayerWatchSam Dyson worked the ninth for his fourth save, but not before the Padres scored once and had the tying run at third when Jabari Blash flied out.  It got kind of exciting there at the end,  Bochy said. Cueto escaped without a decision and has won just twice in eight starts; last year he was 13-1 at the break. The right-hander lasted four innings and was charged with three runs and six hits. He struck out five and walked three. It's the second time this season he's been bothered by blister symptoms, but he didn't skip a turn on the first occasion. Cueto, through a translator, said this ailment has never stuck him before this year and the cause could be the composition of the baseballs.  I think so, probably,  Cueto said.  I feel that the ball is tighter and with my three fingers I can't feel the ball.  I think the best thing for me to do is to take some time off. Right now it feels bad. I'm not throwing very well and I don't want to hurt myself.  Clayton Richard (5-9) went 5 2/3 innings and surrendered four runs, 11 hits and two walks. Richard, who hasn't won in five starts in a row, struck out four.  I thought he settled in relatively nicely there, until the sixth inning,  Padres manager Andy Green said.  The sixth inning kind of got away from him.  It started with a leadoff walk to Hunter Pence which led to Richard's downfall.  That's something I have control over and one of the things I could change,  Richard said.  It's really difficult when you have the lead going and you're expected to come away on top and I wasn't able to do that.  The Giants regained the advantage with a two-run sixth as they chased Richard. Denard Span knocked in the go-ahead run with a single to score Joe Panik, who produced the second of consecutive singles against Richard. In the fourth, San Diego took its first lead at 3-2 when Austin Hedges' single drove in Erick Aybar after his double to right. The Padres tied it 2-2 in the second. Blash, who was recalled earlier from Triple-A El Paso, doubled in Cory Spangenberg after his inning-opening walk. Blash then scored on Aybar's single. San Francisco went up 2-0 on Cueto's second-inning flare to right field, which brought in Brandon Crawford. After Crawford was safe at the plate, Hedges fired down to first base where Cueto was retired after rounding the bag aggressively. The Giants struck in the first, taking a 1-0 lead on Posey's RBI single. Posey's hit fell just in front of a diving Blash in right field to bring around Brandon Belt after he reached on a two-out single.

But the night belonged to a local kid, Rays starting pitcher Jake Faria, who had a significant cheering section of his own that ultimately had reason to celebrate. Faria gave up one run in 6 2/3 innings, leaving with the score tied at 1. Brad Miller's two-out RBI double in the 10th inning off Angels reliever Cam Bedrosian (2-1) was the game-winner in Tampa Bay's 2-1 victory at Angel Stadium. Trout went 1-for-5 with a single and a stolen base, including a strikeout for the final out of the game. Alex Colome pitched the ninth for his 26th save, the last of four Rays relievers who followed Faria. For Faria, who gave up five hits, the game was a homecoming. He grew up in Anaheim and his family had Angels season tickets. And when he was in high school at nearby Gahr in Cerritos, he modeled his delivery after former Angels pitcher Jered Weaver. Related CoveragePreview: Rays at AngelsTampa Bay Rays - PlayerWatchLos Angeles Angels - PlayerWatch I only had to leave nine (tickets),  Faria said.  But my dad ended up buying 60 and my stepdad bought 30 and there were others that filtered in and bought their own tickets. There was probably 200-plus.  It was weird at first. I tried to make it feel like it was any other game. But then being there in the outfield (before the game), stretching and running, I'm looking up ... it was pretty awesome.  The only run Faria allowed came on Albert Pujols' home run leading off the second inning. But he had to dance around trouble in the third and fourth innings. In those two innings, he gave up two singles, walked two, hit a batter and threw a wild pitch. But he escaped both jams, getting Pujols to end the third and Cameron Maybin to end the fourth.  We just didn't get that hit,  Angels manager Mike Scioscia said.  It looks like (Faria's) got really nice poise, used a good split, changed speeds well, hit his spots and got some big outs.  We were in some situations where we could have broken the game open and couldn't do it. I think we were 0-for-7 with runners in scoring position and that's been plaguing us most of the year.  For Faria, though, it was par for the course. He's 4-0 with a 2.00 ERA in his seven starts, and all seven have been quality starts (at least six innings, three earned runs or fewer).  We all continue to be impressed with the way he goes about his starts and competes,  Rays manager Kevin Cash said.  And even when he isn't feeling his best, he finds a way to limit damage and give us every opportunity to score runs.  The Rays, though, couldn't do much with Angels starter Ricky Nolasco, who gave up two hits in seven innings. Both hits came from Evan Longoria, who homered in the first inning and doubled in the seventh. After the seventh, it became a battle of bullpens. Tampa Bay's Adam Kolarek, Tommy Hunter and Brad Boxberger (2-0) preceded Colome. The Angels got scoreless innings from Blake Parker and Bud Norris before Bedrosian gave up a two-out single to Wilson Ramos, followed by Miller's drive off the right-center field fence. Trout's only hit in the game was a single in the third inning. He dived back headfirst into first base after rounding the bag, then slid headfirst into second when he stole a base, the same way he injured the thumb six weeks ago.  Mike's going to play baseball; that's what he's about,  Scioscia said.  Mike's a player that makes everybody around him better, and we need him. Hopefully, we'll get settled and these groupings will work and get some offense. And Mike's obviously a big part of that.  NOTES: To make room for CF Mike Trout on the roster, the Angels optioned OF Eric Young Jr. to Triple-A Salt Lake. Young hit .260 with three homers, 11 RBIs, 18 runs scored and eight stolen bases in 34 games after being called up to take Trout's roster spot May 29. The Angels also called up LHP Jose Alvarez and optioned RHP Mike Morin to Salt Lake. ... Rays OF Colby Rasmus was placed on the restricted list by the Rays on Thursday and isn't expected to return to the club this season because of personal reasons. Rasmus, who was on the disabled list since June 23 because of a hip injury, hit .281 with nine homers and 23 RBIs in 37 games this season.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-rays-angels-writethru-idUSMTZED7F4A8422"},

Gray has been the subject of trade rumors for weeks. So he, as well as family members and friends who text messaged him, naturally wondered if he had been traded.  It's hard,  Gray said.  You get 50 text messages 45 minutes before the game and that's when you just try to put your phone away and go to a place where you can block everything out and get ready for the game. So that's kind of what I tried to do.  As it turned out, Gray wasn't scratched, and he threw six shutout innings in a 5-0 victory at the Oakland Coliseum. Gray (5-4) allowed two hits, struck out five and walked one. He had his fourth straight quality start and has gone 3-1 with four earned runs in 27 innings during that span.  At times it can be difficult,  Gray said of the rumors.  You just don't know. You just don't know. It's just one of those things that you have to deal with sometimes. Whatever happens is going to happen, and that's out of my control.  Related CoveragePreview: Indians at AthleticsA's center fielder Rajai Davis, who played for the Indians last season when they won the American League title but lost to the Chicago Cubs in the World Series, went 2-for-3, scored two runs and hit his third home run of the season in the fifth inning, a solo shot. Davis wasn't going to be in the lineup until rookie center fielder Jaycob Brugman became ill.  When someone goes down like that, someone else gets an opportunity and Rajai made the best of it,  A's manager Bob Melvin said. Yonder Alonso also hit a solo home run in the fifth, his 21st homer of the season. Cleveland manager Terry Francona returned to the bench eight days after undergoing a medical procedure to correct cardiac arrhythmia. Francona, who missed the Indians' previous six games and the All-Star Game, wore a heart monitor. Indians right-hander Carlos Carrasco (10-4) allowed five runs and six hits, including two home runs, as his five-game winning streak ended. He struck out 10, walked two and lost for the first time since June 3 at Kansas City.  He gave up, you know, the solos,  Francona said of Carrasco.  I think on a normal night, or a night when we're swinging a little bit, it looks like a lot more competitive game, but that's kind of the way Oakland has been. They can hit the ball out of the ballpark. Even in this spacious place they hit the ball out of the ballpark, and that's what they do.  The A's led 4-0 through five innings and made it 5-0 in the seventh when rookie Matt Chapman lead off with a triple and scored on a wild pitch by Nick Goody that bounced just a few yards away, to catcher Yan Gomes right. Chapman got a great jump and scored on a head-first slide, beating Gomes' throw. Oakland relievers Ryan Madson, Sean Doolittle and Santiago Casilla each threw a scoreless inning. They combined to blank the Indians on two hits with six strikeouts. The A's scored twice in the third inning to take a 2-0 lead. Davis led off with an infield single, the first hit Carrasco allowed. Matt Joyce lined a double to right-center field, driving in Davis, who barely beat second baseman Erik Gonzalez's relay throw home to Gomes.  As soon as I picked my head up, I took a quick peed and saw (Gonzalez) had the ball and they were about to throw home,  Davis said. I said, 'Uh oh, this is going to be close' When Gomes took a little step to the right, I said,  Now I can see where he goes and then I'm going to slide the other way.  Joyce went to third on the throw home, and Marcus Semien brought him home with a sacrifice fly to deep center field. Davis made it 3-0 with a leadoff home run in the fifth inning. He launched Carrasco's belt-high, 2-0 fastball into the left-center field seats.  It was a fastball down the middle,  Carrasco said.  I was just throwing a slider for ball, a slider for ball, you get behind in the count you just throw a fastball.  Then with two outs in the inning, Alonso hit a solo shot to right-center field, increasing Oakland's lead to 4-0.

Chisenhall was injured during Cleveland's game on Sunday against Detroit. ... Cleveland OF Tyler Naquin was recalled from Triple-A Columbus and started in right field. He went 0-for-3. ...

Jose Bautista drove in two runs with a home run plus a sacrifice fly to back six innings of one-run ball by Sanchez on Friday night while the Blue Jays got their 10-game post All-Star break road trip off to a successful start with a 7-2 victory over the punchless Detroit Tigers. Sanchez (1-2) was making only his seventh start of the season due to a blister on his right middle finger. He allowed a double plus six singles to a Detroit offense that had been without a home run since Dixon Machado's in the second inning on July 6 until Andrew Romine hit his fourth home run with one out in the ninth off reliever Jeff Beliveau. Between the home runs, Detroit had just six doubles among 36 hits in 41 innings. Sanchez walked two and struck out four.  He was really good,  Toronto manager John Gibbons said.  He looked good. He was popping it pretty good, threw some good breaking balls. He looked like the old guy. That's a good sign. Related CoveragePreview: Blue Jays at Tigers He's a big part of our team. We need him. He's definitely the freshest guy out there. His finger feels good. It wouldn't surprise me if he got on a nice little roll.  Toronto (42-47) sealed it in the eighth with three runs, one when Russell Martin drew a four-pitch, two-out walk from reliever Blaine Hardy and two more when Josh Donaldson lined a 3-2 single to left. That put the Blue Jays up 7-1. Danny Barnes gave up one single in the seventh, Joe Biagini got three outs in the eighth and Beliveau finished the ninth to wrap it up. Bautista, in his 19th game as the leadoff hitter, greeted Tigers reliever Warwick Saupold in the seventh with his 15th home run, upping the Blue Jays' lead to 4-1. Kevin Pillar drew a sixth-inning walk on a full count pitch from Detroit reliever Shane Greene with the bases loaded to increase the Toronto lead to 3-1.  You have to throw strikes,  Detroit manager Brad Ausmus said.  You can't walk 10 guys and win games in the major leagues.  The Tigers got runners at first and third with nobody out in their fifth on singles by Jose Iglesias and Alex Presley, but the Blue Jays escaped with just one unearned run scoring thanks to Miguel Cabrera hitting into an inning-ending double play. The run scored when third baseman Donaldson caught Alex Avila's line drive but threw the ball wildly to first for an error that let both runners move up, shaving Toronto's lead to 2-1.  That was a lot better than recent starts in my book,  Sanchez said.  There was a lot of weak contact. I felt like at the beginning I was still trying to find the zone a little bit. My release point.  It was ball, strike, ball, strike, the first couple innings. That kind of got my pitch count up. Then I felt like I kind of settled down, got into a groove, got into the sixth.  Steve Pearce pounded a 2-0 fastball from Justin Verlander (5-7) leading off the Blue Jays' fifth for his seventh home, breaking a scoreless tie. Pillar reached second when J.D. Martinez dropped his fly ball near the foul line for an error, advanced on a groundout to short and scored an unearned run on Bautista's first-pitch sacrifice fly to center, giving Toronto a 2-0 lead.  You just can't have that many deep counts,  Ausmus said.  You have to give Toronto some credit, especially against Verlander, but when you are pitching from behind every time, you are going to keep turning over the lineup and your defense is going to get bored from being out there so long.  Verlander threw 114 pitches in his 5 1/3 innings, running up 2-2 counts on seven batters and 3-2 on six. He struck out five and two of his three walks came to the last two batters he faced. Detroit is 7-15 in its last 22 games to fall to 10 below .500 (39-49) for the season and increase the likelihood it will be a seller by the time the non-waiver trade deadline is reached July 31.

Hinch wasn't surprised by the ragged performance of his team or its opponent on Friday night and, despite an early lead that should have made for a relaxing evening in the home dugout, all Hinch sought was a victory to cure his uneasiness. Brian McCann and Marwin Gonzalez slugged home runs as the Astros produced another offensive showcase in their 10-5 win over the Minnesota Twins at Minute Maid Park.

Obviously, I felt really good at 10-1 and then it was slowly starting to deteriorate. They were getting a lot of baserunners; they stranded a lot of baserunners (11). It just wasn't worth not going to our guys. Related CoveragePreview: Twins at Astros (Luke) Gregerson hadn't pitched in a while and (Ken) Giles hasn't pitched a ton the last two weeks. I just wanted the game to end so I used our best guys (in the eighth and ninth innings).  Gonzalez finished 3-for-5 with two RBIs and two runs scored. Jose Altuve and Carlos Beltran both were 2-for-4 with a walk and a run scored for Houston, which has won nine of 12 games. Twins second baseman Brian Dozier produced his 21st career leadoff home run, a club record, and finished 2-for-5 with four RBIs. He added a two-out, bases-clearing double in the fourth. Right-hander Jose Berrios (8-3) was pulled in the second and suffered the loss for Minnesota.  It just seemed from the get-go for whatever reason he looked uncomfortable,  Twins manager Paul Molitor said of Berrios.  He had trouble getting settled in.  Undeterred by the four-day break for the All-Star Game, the Astros pounded Berrios into submission in the second, with six consecutive batters reaching base to erase a 1-0 deficit. Gonzalez, Alex Bregman and George Springer had run-scoring hits in succession for a 3-1 lead. Altuve walked and Josh Reddick added a sacrifice fly before Carlos Correa delivered an RBI single to center that chased Berrios and pushed the Houston advantage to 5-1 with two outs.  I understand that they are in first place in the division and that they're really hot right now. But that doesn't mean you don't follow your game plan,  Berrios said.  Obviously, they were ahead in most of the counts and that's how they were able to get to me early.  After McCann greeted Hughes with his 11th home run, a shot to right field on an 0-2 count, the Astros led 8-1.  It's just one of those things where this team is different,  McCann said.  It's different because everyone shows up on a daily basis and everyone in here loves baseball. It has been a pleasure.  Berrios was charged with only two earned runs after a fielding error by Twins shortstop Jorge Polanco helped fuel the Astros' outburst. He issued three walks and allowed four hits while notching five outs before departing what was his shorting outing by a wide margin this season. The Astros had their own issues with clean play, committing a pair of errors in the fifth inning. Morton recorded 10 strikeouts but also allowed five runs (four earned) and walked five batters. NOTES: Twins 1B Joe Mauer took batting practice and is poised to be reinstated from the 10-day disabled list in time to start the middle game of the series on Saturday night.

Orlando Arcia hit a three-run home run and Ryan Braun belted his sixth career grand slam as the Brewers scored eight runs in the second inning and held on for a 9-6 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies on Friday night at Miller Park. Davies (11-4) gave up six runs -- five earned -- on seven hits and five walks while striking out six over 5 1/3 innings.  I don't think he was on top of it tonight,  Brewers manager Craig Counsell said.  Five walks, that's not him. There were a couple of walks that really hurt him. Free passes, there are times where you are maybe pitching around somebody, but in a game like this there were a couple of walks that hurt him.  Phillies starter Nick Pivetta (2-5) went five innings and allowed a season-high nine runs on seven hits with three walks and five strikeouts.  This is his first go-round in the big leagues,  Phillies manager Pete Mackanin said.  He's shown us a lot of promise and I like what he's been doing. Today wasn't his best.  Related CoveragePreview: Phillies at BrewersPhiladelphia Phillies - PlayerWatchMilwaukee Brewers - PlayerWatchStaked to an early, 2-0 lead, Pivetta struck out the first four batters before Domingo Santana's one-out double in the second. Pivetta allowed seven consecutive batters to reach. Arcia cleared the bases along the way with a three-run homer when he hit Pivetta's 1-2 pitch over the left-center field wall. It was his ninth homer of the season. After Pivetta sandwiched walks to Davies and Eric Thames around a single to Jonathan Villar, Braun came up and wasted little time. He crushed Pivetta's first offering to straight-away center for his 11th home run and his sixth career grand slam, giving the Brewers an 8-2 lead.  It was a high breaking ball,  Counsell said.  It might have been a ball, actually. I knew Ryan was going to be aggressive that at-bat after his first at-bat. He threw him a bad pitch for a guy that was going to be aggressive.  From there, though, Pivetta settled in. After Braun's grand slam, he retired nine consecutive batters.  It's just part of the game,  Pivetta said.  My concern was after giving up eight runs, going out there and trying to minimize the damage as much as I can so we don't have to wear out the bullpen or use too many position players.  Philadelphia got two runs back in the fifth when Maikel Franco singled to right-center for his second hit of the day. Milwaukee made it a 9-4 game in the bottom of the frame on a sacrifice fly by Manny Pina before the Phillies got within three in the sixth on Odubel Herrera's two-run shot off Davies.  I mean, I'm (angry about) my performance, definitely,  Davies said.  But the team's winning and you can't be selfish in that aspect and be upset and show it when the team is doing what it should be doing.  Franco finished with four hits for Philadelphia while Aaron Altherr added a pair of doubles but had to leave the game in the fifth after suffering a mild strain of his right hamstring. Corey Knebel worked a scoreless ninth for his 15th save of the season as the Brewers won for the 10th time in their last 12 games and maintained a 5 1/2-game lead over the second-place Cubs in the National League Central.

Then they lost the lead and needed some late help from Addison Russell to pull out a dramatic win to properly start the second half. Russell hit a tiebreaking solo homer off Brad Brach in the top of the ninth inning as the Cubs shook off blowing an eight-run lead in a 9-8 victory over the Baltimore Orioles. Russell lined a homer to left on the first pitch from Brach (2-2) with one out in the ninth. It was Chicago's fifth homer of the game. The shortstop's eighth homer this season occurred after Baltimore's Mark Trumbo hit a two-run homer to left against Koji Uehara (3-4) in the eighth that tied the score at 8.  It feels good to come out with that win,  Russell said.  (I was) just looking for a ball in the zone.

Related CoveragePreview: Cubs at OriolesChicago Cubs - PlayerWatchCubs closer Wade Davis pitched the ninth for his 17th save. The Orioles (42-47) scored eight straight runs after the Cubs took the big early lead. That's a reason why Chicago manager Joe Maddon thought this victory was so important.  It was really important under the circumstances,  Maddon said.  We had such a big lead and then forfeited that lead. That's the part that would've made it even more difficult. Under the circumstances of how that game was played tonight, it was really good to finish it off.  Willson Contreras (three-run) and Kyle Schwarber (solo) both homered as the Cubs (44-45) scored four in the first. Ben Zobrist and Jason Heyward added two-run homers in the second and third, respectively, and Chicago took the early eight-run lead. The Cubs pounded Orioles starter Kevin Gausman for eight runs and seven hits in the three innings. Gausman saw his ERA jump to 6.39, and while he avoided the loss, the right-hander was not happy.  Yeah, it's frustrating,  Gausman said.  Obviously, I wanted to come out here and hit the ground running going into this second half. It was just bad.  The bullpen kept the Orioles in the game after Gausman's rocky start. Five pitchers combined to allow that one run and three hits in six innings. They struck out six and walked only one.  It was great,  Orioles manager Buck Showalter said.  That's as good as you could ask, especially with that much time off. We're lucky because with that much time off, we had everybody available.  The Cubs answered a 49-minute rain delay by starting quickly in the first, when Zobrist led off with a double and went to third on a one-out single from Anthony Rizzo. Both came around to score as Contreras crushed a three-run homer to left-center field. Schwarber added a solo shot on the next pitch, which made it 4-0 against Gausman. The right-hander found more trouble in the second as Zobrist lined a two-run homer to right. Heyward added a two-run homer to deep right that made it 8-0 in the third, again off Gausman. The Orioles answered with a Welington Castillo solo homer in the third and a Chris Davis RBI double off starter Mike Montgomery in the fourth. The Orioles then put runners at second and third with one out in the fifth, ending Montgomery's night. Justin Grimm entered and allowed RBI singles to Trumbo and Trey Mancini and a Joey Rickard two-run single that sliced the lead to 8-6 before Ruben Tejada flied out, ending the inning.

Napoli and Beltre accounted for all of the Rangers' runs as they rallied to defeat the Kansas City Royals 5-3 on Friday night. The Royals (44-44) have dropped four straight and are winless in five games this season against the Rangers (44-45), who won their 10th straight over Kansas City dating to last season. Napoli's pinch-homer with Carlos Gomez aboard in the seventh broke a 3-3 deadlock. Napoli pulled Mike Minor's 2-2 pitch 444 feet out to left.  That's what he is here for,  Rangers manager Jeff Banister said of Napoli hitting Joey Gallo.  We just felt the better matchup was Napoli.  It was the Rangers' first pinch-homer since Leonys Martin did it May 19, 2015, at Boston.  Any time you can come through like that late in the game, it's always fun,  Napoli said.  Especially coming off the bench in a pinch-hitting situation. It's tough, but I just got ready to play and put a good swing on it.  Minor tried to fool Napoli with a changeup. Related CoveragePreview: Rangers at Royals I thought it was the right pitch,  Minor said.  It just came back over the plate. If I execute the pitch, we're fine.  Beltre helped the Rangers rally from a 3-0 deficit with a three-run blast in the sixth. It was Beltre's 453rd career home run, moving him one past Carl Yastrzemski and into 38th place on the all-time list. That also upped his RBI count to 1,601 and put him within 20 of reaching 3,000 career hits. The Royals increased their advantage to 3-0 in the fifth when Whit Merrifield doubled down the right-field line and scored on Jorge Bonifacio's single to center. Bonifacio was out at second, trying to stretch his hit into a double. That lead soon evaporated. Jason Hammel did not allow a hit until one out in the sixth, but he failed to get out of the inning. Elvis Andrus chopped one off the plate for an infield single, which Hammel deflected, for the first Texas hit. Nomar Mazara's fly-ball single to shallow left moved Andrus to second before Beltre homered.  It's been the theme, kind of for the year,  Hammel said.  It's been just one pitch, which more or less, I want to be down in the zone with it and it's just a hanger that ends up costing us.  We let them back in the door there. If we shut the door there, I think we win the ballgame. A slider in the dirt that's just got to be a better executed pitch there.  For a guy who's sitting and from what I know and the experience of just facing him, he sits soft with two strikes. I've thrown him quite a few to him already. So he was looking for it and it stayed up enough for him to put a good swing on it.  After Robinson Chirinos' two-out single on Hammel's 108th pitch, manager Ned Yost went to his bullpen, bringing in left-hander Minor.  If you take back just the one pitch, he was outstanding,  Yost said. Rangers starter Martin Perez (5-6) threw 89 pitches in seven innings to pick up the victory. Perez allowed three runs and eight hits. He is 3-0 in his past four starts. Matt Bush worked a flawless eighth and left-hander Alex Caudio got the final three outs for his second save this season. The Rangers have lost five games this season they have led after eight innings, but this time the bullpen maintained the lead. Eric Hosmer's infield single in the Kansas City sixth extended his hitting streak to 16 games, the longest active streak in the majors. Hosmer was quickly erased when Salvador Perez grounded into his 13th double play, one behind the league leader. Hammel held the Rangers hitless for the first five innings, allowing only three baserunners. He walked Beltre to leadoff the second and Carlos Gomez with two outs in the fifth. Hosmer's fielding error put Mazara on base with out in the fourth. Alcides Escobar extended his hitting streak at home to 11 games with a second-inning home run that clanged off the left-field pole and put the Royals up 2-0. Mike Moustakas, who reached on an infield single, was aboard when Escobar homered on a 2-0 Perez offering.

Servais certainly can't complain about the first step the Mariners took Friday night. Robinson Cano hit a three-run homer and James Paxton struck out nine in six innings as the Mariners beat the Chicago White Sox 4-2. Paxton (8-3) scattered five hits and allowed two earned runs on a night when the left-hander and the Seattle bullpen combined for 15 strikeouts. Edwin Diaz picked up his 14th save with a scoreless ninth inning. Cano's third-inning blast gave the Seattle pitchers all the offense it needed as the Mariners opened the second half of the season with their fifth victory in the last 15 games. Related CoveragePreview: Mariners at White SoxBut Servais said thewin can only be the beginning.  We've got to continue to roll with this and keep building on it,  he said.  We've got a good vibe in our clubhouse right now, (we have) a really good discussion of where we're at as a ballclub right now. I think that's really important to laying all on the table so our guys know where things are at and that they have to pick it up.  Matt Davidson and Tyler Saladino hit RBI doubles for the White Sox, who didn't manage a hit after the fourth inning. Chicago starter James Shields allowed four runs and seven hits in six innings. The Mariners jumped out to a 3-1 lead in the third inning after Cano blasted his 18th home run of the season off the top of the right field wall. Cano belted the first pitch he saw from Shields after Mike Zunino walked and Jean Segura singled earlier in the inning.  I knew I hit it good,  Cano said.  It was good it went over the fence.  The White Sox got within 3-2 in the fourth inning on a Davidson double that scored Avisail Garcia, who singled and then stole second. But the Mariners quickly extended their lead back to two runs in the fifth inning when Segura -- who doubled to lead off the inning and advanced to third on a Cano groundout -- scored on a wild pitch by Shields.  I kept the team in the game, but two pitches really cost me,  Shields said.  The one to Cano, obviously, the homer, and the passed ball. If I make my pitches right there, I think it's a whole different ballgame. I'm not happy with the outing, but we're going to keep grinding it out and move forward.  Paxton, meanwhile, settled in and got stronger as his outing went on. He retired the final eight hitters he faced and finished with back-to-back strikeouts to set up the Seattle bullpen for success.  That will work,  Paxton said of his start.  Started getting my legs under me a little bit and started to feel better in that fifth and sixth inning after I got it going a little bit.  Saladino gave the White Sox a 1-0 lead in the second inning with an RBI double that scored Garcia, who singled with one out. Garcia advanced to third with a stolen base and a Zunino throwing error. After Davidson struck out, Saladino -- who was activated from the disabled list on Friday -- lined a ground-rule double into the right field corner. But once Cano sparked the offense and the pitching got rolling, the Mariners got off to the kind of start they were hoping to find coming out of the All-Star break.  It's really important when every game means more,  Cano said.  Every game is important that we win so we can keep ourselves in the race.

But the second half beginning Friday the way the Mets wished the first half unfolded allowed them to maintain a flicker of hope they can make an unlikely run into postseason contention. Jacob deGrom won his sixth straight start when seven Mets had at least two hits apiece in a 14-2 rout of the Colorado Rockies at Citi Field. The Mets expected to receive a combination of ace-caliber pitching and timely hitting regularly in the first half. But deGrom was the only member of the projected Opening Day rotation to avoid the disabled list and lineup anchor Yoenis Cespedes -- who entered Friday in a 5-for-40 skid before collecting a team-high four hits -- was one of five everyday players shelved by injury. As a result, the Mets (40-47) are 9 1/2 games behind the Rockies (52-40) in the race for the National League's second wild card.  We just have to do our best to capitalize on opportunities that are provided for us and presented to us,  Mets right fielder Jay Bruce said.  That was a good win tonight. That's a good team over there. They've been playing well all year. So, we know what we're capable of.  Related CoveragePreview: Rockies at MetsColorado Rockies - PlayerWatchDeGrom (10-3) continued to do what he's capable of performing like one of the best pitchers in the game on Friday, when he allowed two runs (one earned), four hits and one walk while striking out 11. He threw 26 pitches in the first inning before retiring 14 straight between the first and fifth.  I knew I threw a lot of pitches in the first inning, so my goal was to get some early outs and I was able to do that,  deGrom said. DeGrom has produced a 1.53 ERA in his last six starts, a stretch in which he has thrown at least seven innings every time while striking out 47 and walking 10. He has seven double-digit strikeout games this season and has thrown at least eight innings five times, a figure exceeded only by the Washington Nationals' Max Scherzer (six).  A guy like Jake -- I thought we had five of them to start the season -- (is one of) those number one guys,  manager Terry Collins said after the Mets improved to 12-6 in deGrom's starts.  When you need them, they rise up. They're there when you need them the most. They keep you from having losing streaks, because when it's their turn and you've lost three or four in a row, they step up and they shut the other team down.  Cespedes, who missed 44 games in the first half due to various leg injuries, offers a similar boost at the plate and in the field to the Mets. The left fielder doubled to start a six-run third inning, capped New York's scoring by beating out an infield RBI single in the eighth and snuffed out the Rockies' biggest threat in the sixth by nabbing D.J. LeMahieu at the plate to finish an inning-ending 7-2 double play.  He's got all the skills,  Collins said.  If we're going to get in it, he's got to lead the way.  DeGrom spotted the Rockies an unearned run in the first when he committed a throwing error one batter before Geraldo Parra laced a one-out RBI single. But deGrom got the run back in the second when he followed up Travis d'Arnaud's run-scoring groundout by hitting an RBI single to give the Mets the lead for good. T.J. Rivera (two-run double), Jose Reyes (RBI single), Michael Conforto (run-scoring groundout) and Asdrubal Cabrera (two-run single) helped the Mets blow the game open in the third. Rivera homered leading off the fourth and Conforto hit a three-run shot in the sixth. Cabrera drew a bases-loaded walk in the eighth. Parra and Charlie Blackmon had two hits apiece for the Rockies, who have lost 14 of 19. Blackmon scored Colorado's second run on a sixth-inning wild pitch.  It's one game, against a guy who was on,  Rockies manager Bud Black said. Jon Gray (2-1) took the loss after allowing eight runs, nine hits and three walks while striking out one in two-plus innings. It was the second shortest start of Gray's career.  I just wanted to get positive energy going for the first game, and it sucks to kind of let the whole team down like that,  Gray said.

He's special and we all know that,  Braves manager Brian Snitker said.  He just keeps doing it and has all year.  Freeman, who moved from first base to third to keep Matt Adams' bat in the lineup, is hitting .400 (12-for-30) with six extra-base hits and 10 RBIs while getting at least one hit in all of the games since his return.

Bradley (3-2) hadn't allowed a run in 16 of his previous 17 games and the two runs he gave up with four hits in the eighth matched the total for his previous 24 outings spanning 23 2/3 innings.  Archie is our guy. He'll get the ball every time in the eighth inning,  Lovullo said. The Diamondbacks had taken the lead in the top of the eighth on an unearned run. Chris Owings singled, took third as catcher Tyler Flowers made a throwing error on his stolen base and scored on a two-out wild pitch by reliever Jose Ramirez. Paul Goldschmidt's 21st homer tied it in the seventh inning. The All-Star first baseman picked on a high changeup from left-handed reliever Sam Freeman and deposited it to left-center field that just made it into the seats. The blast cost Braves starter R.A. Dickey a chance for a fifth straight home victory and got the Diamondbacks' Taijuan Walker off the hook for a potential loss. Dickey limited Arizona to one run in six innings despite eight hits, two walks and a hit batter. The 42-year-old knuckleballer struck out four.  I've felt pretty good for a while now,  said Dickey, who has a 1.09 ERA in his past five starts.  Finding the right rhythm.  Walker hung a 1-0 curveball to Freeman with one out in the sixth inning and the Braves slugger drove the pitch over the right field wall. The Diamondbacks lost a chance for more than one run in the top of the sixth when Walker grounded into an inning-ending double play with the bases loaded. Arizona had four straight singles, with Daniel Descalso's third hit driving in the run. The Braves scored a first-inning run against Walker on a leadoff double by Inciarte, their lone All-Star Game representative, and a two-out single by Matt Kemp. The Diamondbacks had seven runners on base in the first four innings against Dickey but hit into a double play and left six stranded. NOTES: INF Johan Camargo, hitting .327 after going 1-for-3, replaced SS Dansby Swanson in the Braves lineup for the third time in six games. ... Swanson has a .146/.222/.220 slash line in his past 13 games. ... The Braves placed RHP Jason Motte (strained back) on the 10-day disabled list retroactive to July 6 and recalled RHP Jason Hursh from Triple-A Gwinnett to take his place in the bullpen. ... LHP Patrick Corbin (6-8, 4.81 ERA) will start the middle game of the weekend series Saturday for the Diamondbacks against Braves RHP Mike Foltynewicz (7-5. 3.77 ERA). ... Corbin is 3-0 with five career games (three starts) against Atlanta and hasn't allowed a run in 25 2/3 innings. ... Foltynewicz has won his past four decisions. ... The Diamondbacks swept a three-game series at Turner Field a year ago and won the season series 5-2.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-diamondbacks-braves-writethru-idUSMTZED7F433GRJ"},

The S&P; 1500 Homebuilding index .SPCOMHOME of homebuilder companies has surged 32 percent this year and hit a decade-high earlier this week. By contrast, the wider S&P; Composite 1500 Index .SPCOMP has gained less than 9 percent. Housing optimists are pinning their bets on strong U.S. job creation, low interest rates, tight housing supply, robust earnings estimates and a lack of recessionary red flags.  Some investors still see opportunities, but others warn the stocks may have run too far.   The sentiment has been quite positive for housing but where they are today, I'm not a buyer of housing stocks. The stocks have run up faster than the data supports and there are better pockets of value in the market,  said Erin Browne, global macro portfolio manager at UBS O'Connor in New York. Brown cited weakening growth in building permits and new projects, known as housing starts, since the first quarter as well as land and labor constraints.   While new home sales still look solid, they are still low versus historical levels, given the ongoing shortage of skilled labor and buildable lots which is constraining faster growth,  she said.   Data shows first quarter single-family housing starts grew 6 percent year-over-year and 8.5 percent in May. Overall housing starts have risen 1.27 percent so far this year. Next week's June data is expected to show an 8.3 percent increase from May.  Demand overall has been positive for the builders,  according to Will Randow, analyst at Citi, although he questioned whether it was positive enough to support such an outsized gain by the group. Randow believes the stocks have risen partly on hopes that policy changes by the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump could help boost home sales. Double-Digit Growth Wall Street analysts expect most home builders to report solid double-digit earnings growth, according to Reuters data.  D.R. Horton Inc (DHI.N), whose quarterly profit is seen rising 14 percent, and PulteGroup (PHM.N), pegged for 15.5 percent earnings growth, will both report in the last week of July. But Randow says the 2017 median earnings estimate for 12 housing stocks he covers has barely changed in the last three months.  Maybe the stocks have gotten ahead of themselves. It doesn't necessarily mean we're going to see any sort of correction in housing starts.  Earlier this week, Barclays downgraded four U.S. homebuilders, citing a buyer traffic pullback in its June survey that was inconsistent with rising valuations. Short interest in seven homebuilders - the four biggest and the three biggest year-to-date gainers - has risen by 20 percent for 2017, with much of that increase coming in June and July, according to financial analytics firm, S3 Partners. Of the seven, the biggest recent short-selling increase was in LGI Homes (LGIH.O), whose shares are up 46.6 percent for 2017, followed by NVR Inc (NVR.N), up 51.4 percent. And recent trading in SPDR S&P; Homebuilders ETF (XHB.P) has leaned toward defensive bets with options positioning implying  investors are on guard against a near-term decline. Still, some investors still see value.  Gary Bradshaw, portfolio manager at Hodges Capital Management in Dallas, likes D.R. Horton and LGI Homes, and expects a home shortage to boost prices.   Maybe there's another 20 percent in these stocks over the next 12 months, assuming that interest rates stay relatively low,  said Bradshaw.  I still think there's plenty of home buyers and not that many homes.

Two innings later, Benintendi let his feet do the talking. Benintendi walked with the bases loaded in the ninth inning to bring in the winning run as the Red Sox came back to beat the New York Yankees 5-4 at Fenway Park.  No, that's a first. It's a good one,  Benintendi said when asked if he had ever experienced a walk-off walk in his baseball career. In fact, the Red Sox had not won on a walk-off walk since Sept. 23, 2000, when Trot Nixon worked a free pass in the 10th inning against the Baltimore Orioles. It also was Boston's first game-ending walk against the Yankees since Ted Williams scored in the 11th inning of a 1-0 win in August 1956. With Boston trailing 4-3, Mookie Betts and Dustin Pedroia both reached on infield singles to lead off the bottom of the ninth against Yankees closer Aroldis Chapman (2-1). A successful double steal put two runners in scoring position before Xander Bogaerts poked a grounder to second base in the next at-bat. Related CoveragePreview: Yankees at Red SoxNew York Yankees - PlayerWatchThe ball was mishandled by New York's Ronald Torreyes and Betts scored the tying run as Pedroia advanced to third. Chapman intentionally walked Hanley Ramirez to load the bases before walking Benintendi.  I wasn't as sharp as I would like to be,  said Chapman, who blew his third save of 2017.  They hit the ball a couple times in that inning. My control wasn't there tonight. It just got complicated in that inning.  Ramirez had a two-run shot for his 14th homer of the season while Pedroia, Bogaerts and Benintendi each finished with one RBI for the Red Sox (51-39). Boston extended its lead over New York in the American League East to 4 1/2 games.  It's a credit to our guys of not maybe losing focus inside some at-bats,  Red Sox manager John Farrell said.  We battled, we fought back. Just a good finish to this one.  Gary Sanchez hit a two-run homer, his 14th this year, and Brett Gardner had an RBI for the Yankees (45-42), who started the second half on weak footing after losing 18 of 25 entering the All-Star break.  It's frustrating because we've put ourselves in some situations to win some games and we haven't been able to close them out for whatever reason,  Yankees manager Joe Girardi said. Boston's Drew Pomeranz gave up four runs on six hits and two walks with seven strikeouts in a six-inning no-decision for the Red Sox. Robby Scott (1-1) pitched a scoreless ninth for the win. Yankees starter Jordan Montgomery, recalled from Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre before the game, allowed three runs on six hits and three walks with three strikeouts in a four-inning no-decision.  I was just a little too quick to the plate,  Montgomery said of his outing.  There's a lot of factors, probably pulling out a little quick.  New York scored three runs in the fifth inning to grab a 4-3 lead. Gardner's one-out RBI single brought the Yankees within a run. Sanchez's blast in the next at-bat traveled approximately 409 feet and easily cleared the Green Monster in left field. Sanchez also drove in New York's first run with an RBI single in the third. Ramirez gave Boston a 2-1 lead with his estimated 406-foot Monster shot in the bottom of the inning. Pedroia gave the Red Sox a temporary two-run cushion with his bases-loaded RBI single in the fourth. NOTES: Boston 3B Pablo Sandoval was designated for assignment Friday. The Red Sox still owe him $49.5 million on his five-year, $95 million contract.  (We felt) we were not a better club if he was at the (major league) level,  president of baseball operations Dave Dombrowski said. Sandoval, 30, hit .212 with four home runs and 12 RBIs in 32 games this season. ...
