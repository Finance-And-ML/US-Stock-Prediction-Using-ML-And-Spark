[{"content": "LOS ANGELES\u2014      John G. Avildsen,        who directed \u201cRocky\u201d and \u201cThe Karate Kid\u201d\u2014two dark-horse, underdog favorites that went on to become Hollywood franchises\u2014died Friday at age 81.Anthony Avildsen       said his father died Friday in Los Angeles from pancreatic cancer. \u201cHe was a pretty extraordinary man in my estimation. He was supertalented and very driven and very stubborn, and that was to his detriment but also often to his benefit,\u201d Anthony Avildsen said.\u201cRocky\u201d was a huge success. It won Oscars for best picture, director and editing and was nominated for seven others. No less a Hollywood eminence than       Frank Capra       loved it, telling the New York Times in 1977, \u201cWhen I saw it, I said, \u2018Boy, that\u2019s a picture I wish I had made.\u2019\u201dFor his part, Mr. Avildsen said Mr. Capra, who also championed underdogs on film, was his favorite director.\u201cRocky\u201d was a chance venture for Mr. Avildsen.       Sylvester Stallone,        then unknown, had written the script and sought Mr. Avildsen to direct it, but Mr. Avildsen was already working on another film. Suddenly the production company ran out of money and that film was canceled.A friend sent Mr. Avildsen the \u201cRocky\u201d script. \u201cOn page 3, this guy (Rocky) is talking to his turtles, and I was hooked,\u201d Mr. Avildsen said. \u201cIt was a great character study.\u201dMr. Avildsen agreed to direct \u201cRocky\u201d even though he knew nothing about boxing.The film was shot on a tight budget, less than $1 million, and it was completed in 28 days.\u201cThe first time I showed it to 40 or 50 friends, they all freaked out, so that was encouraging,\u201d he recalled. \u201cBut I guess when I saw the lines around the block, it began to take on a reality.\u201dFive sequels followed, but Mr. Avildsen turned them down, until the fourth, \u201cRocky V,\u201d in 1990. He said he considered it a good script and liked that Rocky would die. During the shooting, the producers decided Rocky had to live. \u201cYou don\u2019t kill off your corporate assets,\u201d Mr. Avildsen said. The fifth sequel, \u201cRocky Balboa,\u201d came out in 2006.\u201cThe Karate Kid\u201d was another surprise hit. In it, a teenager hounded by bullies played by       Ralph Macchio       seeks help from a Japanese handyman (Noryuki \u201cPat\u201d Morita), who teaches him about karate. At the climax, a newly self-confident Mr. Macchio takes on a bully in a karate contest and wins.Released in the summer of 1984, \u201cThe Karate Kid\u201d attracted millions of youngsters and brought Mr. Morita, a veteran performer best known for his TV roles, an Oscar nomination as best supporting actor.\u201cAs soon as the producers saw the business it was doing, they wanted to do it again,\u201d Mr. Avildsen said in a 1986 interview. \u201cI was very apprehensive. I didn\u2019t want to do a sequel because this was a very tough act to follow.\u201dHe relented and directed both \u201cThe Karate Kid, Part II\u201d in 1986 and \u201cThe Karate Kid, Part III\u201d in 1989. (The franchise was revived in 2010 with a hit remake directed by       Harald Zwart.      )Mr. Avildsen had come up the hard way in films. He started with a long apprenticeship as assistant director, then moved up to production manager, cinematographer and editor.He directed a few small films and then broke through with \u201cJoe\u201d (1970).       Peter Boyle       portrayed a hard-hat bigot at odds with the emerging hippie youth culture.\u201cMy hope as a filmmaker is to make people feel a little differently about something when they leave the theater,\u201d Mr. Avildsen told the Los Angeles Times in 1971.Mr. Avildsen liked working with unknowns like Mr. Boyle. \u201cThe problem with name actors is everyone knows them, no matter how (Dustin) Hoffman-y they look,\u201d he told the Times.Mr. Boyle, whose career got a huge boost from \u201cJoe,\u201d told the New York Times that as a director, Mr. Avildsen was \u201con your side. He makes you feel good about what you\u2019re doing.\u201dAfter \u201cJoe,\u201d Mr. Avildsen directed \u201cSave the Tiger\u201d (1973) starring       Jack Lemmon       as a burned-out dress manufacturer. Mr. Lemmon won the Oscar as best actor for \u201cSave the Tiger,\u201d while       Jack Gilford       got a supporting-actor nomination.Among other Oscar nominations for \u201cRocky\u201d were two for Mr. Stallone, best actor and best screenplay; plus best actress,       Talia Shire      ; best supporting actor,       Burgess Meredith       and       Burt Young      ; and best song, \u201cGonna Fly Now.\u201dMr. Avildsen directed other major stars:       Burt Reynolds       in \u201cW.W. and the Dixie Dancekings\u201d (1975);       George C. Scott       and       Marlon Brando       in \u201cThe Formula\u201d (1980);       Dan Aykroyd       and       John Belushi       in \u201cNeighbors\u201d (1981); and       Morgan Freeman       in \u201cLean on Me\u201d (1989).He had been hired to direct \u201cSaturday Night Fever\u201d after his success with \u201cRocky,\u201d but was let go amid differences over his desire to make the story more upbeat than the producers had in mind. \u201cIt\u2019s better not to be doing something you don\u2019t want to do,\u201d Mr. Avildsen told the Los Angeles Times after he departed from the project.\u201cThroughout the decades, his rousing portrayals of victory, courage and emotion captured the hearts of generations of Americans,\u201d the Directors Guild of America wrote in a statement Friday.John Guilbert Avildsen was born in 1935 in Oak Park, Ill., the son of a tool manufacturer. He attended New York University, then worked as an advertising copywriter. He spent two years in the Army as a chaplain\u2019s assistant.A documentary on Mr. Avildsen, \u201cJohn G. Avildsen: King of the Underdogs,\u201d premiered earlier this year at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival. The film, which is to be released digitally in August, was shot by Anthony Avildsen.Mr. Avildsen is survived by his sons Jonathan, Ashley and Anthony, and daughter Bridget.\u2014Copyright 2017 the Associated Press", "news_time": "2017-06-16 23:28:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/rocky-karate-kid-director-john-avildsen-dies-at-81-1497670116", "news_title": "\u2018Rocky,\u2019 \u2018Karate Kid\u2019 Director John Avildsen Dies at 81", "keywords": "avildsen,director,joe,karate kid,rocky,John G.

Lam and the victims worked out of the warehouse.Shaun Vu,        a senior UPS driver, has said Lam struggled with personal issues and was depressed a few years ago. He had shown improvement, but Ms. Vu said Lam looked troubled a few weeks ago. That was around the time Lam filed a grievance claiming he was working excessive overtime.While the three drivers who died appeared to be targeted, it wasn\u2019t clear if they had anything to do with Lam\u2019s apparent sense of disrespect.UPS driver Jevir Gray rejected the possibility that the victims\u2014      Benson Louie,       Mike Lefiti       and       Wayne Chan      \u2014disrespected Lam, saying they were \u201creally good people.\u201d\u201cThey were my mentors,\u201d Mr. Gray said. \u201cI looked up to them.\u201dMs. Vu has said Lam seemed to be on friendly terms with the three men he killed.UPS driver       Leopold Parker,        who witnessed the shooting, said drivers at the warehouse generally got along and didn\u2019t mind working there. If they did have a problem with colleagues, they would talk to them or ignore them. He also stressed that drivers spent much of their time alone in their trucks, so they had limited interaction with their colleagues.Lam sometimes complained about the workload, but Mr. Parker said he never suspected Lam would turn violent.Mr. Parker said he was standing by his truck at the morning meeting when Lam walked up and shot Mr. Louie in the head, he said. Mr. Louie was a few feet in front of Mr. Parker and glanced at him, Mr. Parker said.\u201cI heard a pop. I saw a flash. I saw Benson drop in front of me,\u201d he said. \u201cHe glanced at me, so I thought I was next cause I was right next to Benson.\u201dBut Lam went the opposite way. Mr. Parker said he jumped into the cab of his truck and he saw a couple of bodies on the ground when he looked over. He ran to the roof of the building after he saw Lam running toward an exit.Joe Cilia,        an official with the union that represents UPS workers in San Francisco, has said witnesses told him that after shooting Mr. Louie, Lam shot Mr. Chan in the back and then walked up and \u201cfinished him.\u201dMr. Lefiti was fleeing from the building when Lam went to a street and shot him, Mr. Cilia said, citing witnesses.The violence ended when Lam turned the gun on himself and took his own life as workers ran from the packing facility and police closed in, police have said.\u2014Copyright 2017 the Associated Press", "news_time": "2017-06-16 22:38:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/ups-gunman-may-have-felt-disrepected-by-co-workers-1497667115", "news_title": "UPS Gunman May Have Felt Disrepected by Co-workers", "keywords": "going postal,ups driver,ups shooting,ups warehouse,warehouse shooting,United Parcel Service ,UPS,Benson Louie,Jimmy Lam,Mike Lefiti,Wayne Chan,labor,personnel,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,crime,legal action,rampage,serial killings,murder,manslaughter,couriers,messengers,freight transport,logistics,transportation"}, {"content": "The NBC television station in Connecticut won\u2019t broadcast       Megyn Kelly\u2019s       interview this Sunday with controversial radio personality       Alex Jones,        who has claimed the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting of 2012 in Newtown, Conn. was a hoax.The decision of WVIT-TV, which is based in New Britain and is the only NBC station in the state, is the latest sign of the resistance Ms. Kelly and NBC News are coming up against for the interview with Mr. Jones, the founder of the right-wing website Infowars.The backlash began after NBC aired a promo with brief snippets of the piece. Critics, including families whose children were among the 26 victims in the Sandy Hook massacre, have said the network is giving a platform to a conspiracy theorist. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. asked for its ads to be removed from the show and NBC has acknowledged that some other advertisers withdrew also.The decision of an NBC-owned station not to carry the story is an unusual rebuke of its own company\u2019s news division. The general manager of the station,       Susan Tully,        said in a memo to staff that the wounds from that shooting are \u201cstill so raw\u201d that it has decided not to air the piece.\u201cWhenever there is news regarding the Sandy Hook tragedy, we know that the pain resurfaces for our community, our viewers and for you, our colleagues at WVIT. Over the last few days, we have listened intently to Sandy Hook parents, our viewers and importantly, to you,\u201d Ms. Tully said in her memo.The station is the only outlet so far to decline to carry the interview.NBC declined to comment. A spokeswoman for Ms. Kelly didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.Ms. Kelly\u2019s interview with Mr. Jones has generated tremendous interest in her Sunday broadcast, but at the cost of a great deal of controversy early in her tenure at the network. She made her on-air debut for NBC earlier this year after becoming a star anchor at Fox News in recent years.Ms. Kelly has defended the decision to interview Mr. Jones, saying on Twitter that viewers need to learn more about him because \u201cPresident       Donald Trump       has appeared on his show and praised Mr. Jones\u201d and journalism\u2019s job is to \u201cshine a light.\u201dA promotional picture showing the Ms. Kelly and Mr. Jones appearing together in sunglasses in a car struck critics as sign she would be going easy on the right-wing provocateur.Ms. Kelly and NBC were further put on the defensive after Mr. Jones released a tape of conversations with Ms. Kelly prior to their sit-down in which she compliments him and assures him that he won\u2019t be portrayed as \u201csome kind of boogeyman.\u201d To be sure, journalists often try to convince reluctant interview subjects of their good intentions, but Ms. Kelly\u2019s comments added to an already uncomfortable situation for NBC.NBC and Ms. Kelly have subsequently decided to alter the segment on Mr. Jones by adding an interview with a family member of a Sandy Hook victim.Write to Joe Flint at joe.flint@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-16 21:50:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/nbcs-connecticut-tv-station-wont-air-megyn-kellys-interview-with-alex-jones-1497664247", "news_title": "NBC\u2019s Connecticut TV Station Won\u2019t Air Megyn Kelly\u2019s Interview With Alex Jones ", "keywords": "alex jones,connecticut,infowars,megyn kelly,nbc,nbc news,sandy hook,sandy hook massacre,sandy hook shooting,Alex Jones,Megyn Kelly,political,general news,crime,legal action,arts,entertainment,rampage,serial killings,murder,manslaughter,network television (discontinued from 11th july 2017),television,radio,interviews,broadcasting,television broadcasting,media"}, {"content": "LONDON\u2014Anger grew Friday over the huge fire that ripped through a low-income London high-rise, as residents and neighbors vented their outrage and desperately sought news on the many still unaccounted for two days later.Protesters barged into a meeting at the town of the local council responsible for the building, chanting \u201cWe want justice!\u201d and \u201cShame on you!\u201d A scuffle briefly broke out outside the town hall but appeared to be quickly subdued.As the death toll from Wednesday\u2019s fire rose to 30 and appeared certain to increase, attention turned to the aluminum cladding on the 24-floor building\u2019s recently refurbished exterior. Questions focused on whether the material contributed to the fire\u2019s quick spread, as the government came under pressure to clarify its policies on building materials and fire-safety regulation.Residents, who had complained for years that the building wasn\u2019t fire-safe, questioned how a disaster of such severity could happen in a country as wealthy as the U.K. and said the government and local officials hadn\u2019t done enough to help them in its aftermath.The tower\u2014which neighbors said was home to a diverse group of people, many of them fleeing warzones in the Middle East and Africa\u2014sits on a large estate in north Kensington near Notting Hill, an island of government-subsidized housing in a neighborhood that has rapidly transformed into one of London\u2019s trendiest and priciest addresses.Bob Felix,        who lived near the building, said that Grenfell Tower residents\u2019 warnings about a lack of emergency exits and insufficient fire alarms were ignored.\u201cSome of them were poor people, disabled people, elderly. They had no voice,\u201d Mr. Felix, 60 years old, said. \u201dSomething like this would never happen in a building with rich people. They\u2019d have sprinklers, fire alarms, hydrants.\u201dSome directed their ire at Prime Minister       Theresa May,        who met injured people in the hospital on Friday after coming under intense criticism for not meeting with residents during a private visit to the scene the previous day, blaming security concerns. Pressure has continued to mount on the British leader, who was dealt a major setback in elections last week after struggling to connect with voters. Her approval ratings have plummeted over the last two months.\u201cI understand she is the prime minister and there are a lot of nutters out there. But she should\u2019ve met with some of the people, residents, families,\u201d said       Koni Vitalis,        58. \u201cIf not, what is she coming here for? Just to look around for 15 minutes?\u201dQueen Elizabeth II       and       Prince William       met with victims, community members and emergency services officials\u00a0on Friday\u00a0and       Jeremy Corbyn,        head of the opposition Labour Party, met Thursday with residents.London Mayor       Sadiq Khan,        in a letter to Mrs. May published\u00a0Friday, said he spent hours talking to people around Grenfell Tower. He urged Mrs. May to provide a list of tower blocks that have been checked for fire-safety standards and asked for a timeline for the remaining buildings.\u201cPeople are terrified that the same thing could happen to them,\u201d Mr. Khan wrote. \u201cThis issue is not limited to the type of cladding fitted: the material it is attached to and how this has been achieved are also critical factors.\u201d He said other risks from renovation works must be urgently investigated.Mrs. May on Friday she had established a \u00a35 million ($6.4 million) fund to pay for emergency supplies, food, clothes and other costs, such as for funerals. The victims and their families will also have access to free legal representation at the public inquiry, she said.\u201cEveryone affected by this tragedy needs reassurance that the government is there for them at this terrible time\u2014and that is what I am determined to provide,\u201d Mrs. May said. She said the government would identify and conduct fire safety reviews of all high-rise public housing buildings.U.K. Foreign Secretary       Boris Johnson       hit back at criticism of Mrs. May and the Conservative Party. In a Facebook post published\u00a0Friday, he criticized the opposition party for \u201cpolitical game playing\u201d in the aftermath of a tragedy.Questions have grown about the material used on the exterior of the building. London newspapers the Times and the Guardian reported that the building was refurbished last year using cladding that was \u00a32 ($2.55) per meter cheaper than a fire-resistant alternative.Robert Pontin,        a spokesman for Harley Facades Ltd, said the\u00a0company installed\u00a0cladding\u00a0made from aluminum composite as part of\u00a0its refurbishment work.Harley Facades purchased the\u00a0cladding, called Reynobond PE, from Omnis Exteriors and that it was\u00a0unaware of a link between the fire and the exterior\u00a0cladding\u00a0to the\u00a0tower. Omnis didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.Exterior cladding on the 24-story Grenfell Tower that caught fire wouldn\u2019t have met widely adopted U.S. standards, building groups said, though the material has been used in a number of high-rise buildings around the world.Conditions in the charred block were still hazardous, slowing the search for bodies. London Police Cmdr.       Stuart Cundy       said the death toll had reached at least 30, with 12 bodies taken to the mortuary and more still inside the building.\u201cI do believe the number [of dead] will increase,\u201d he said. On Thursday, he had said he was hopeful that the toll wouldn\u2019t reach more than 100. He said 24 people were being treated in the hospital, with 12 still in critical care. All of the fires within the building have now been extinguished, he said.An investigation into the blaze will look into whether criminal offenses were committed, Cmdr. Cundy said, though it wasn\u2019t believed that the fire had been deliberately set. This will be about \u201cproviding as best we possibly can answers for those who have been so deeply and tragically affected by the terrible fire here at Grenfell Tower,\u201d he said.He said it wasn\u2019t clear how many people were still missing. In the Grenfell Tower area, people posted hundreds of fliers seeking missing friends and family members.Manfred Ruiz,        a former resident of the neighborhood, said he came from Gloucestershire in southwestern England to support his sister in the search for her 12-year-old daughter,       Jessica Urbano,        who lived on the 20th floor.Around 1:30 a.m. Wednesday, Jessica made two calls from a stranger\u2019s phone to her mother, who was outside the building, to tell her she was making her way down the stairwell with some neighbors.\u201cShe said \u2018Mummy can you please come get me,\u2019 but they\u2019d already stopped letting people in a couple of minutes earlier,\u201d Mr. Ruiz said.Mr. Ruiz said he and his family are regularly checking all hospitals that are treating the injured.\u201cWe\u2019re not giving up hope. It\u2019s Jessica\u2019s birthday next month.\u201dMo Khalil said his uncle,       Hesham Rahman,        57, lived on the top floor and made a phone call to his family around 3:15 a.m., telling them he couldn\u2019t come down because the smoke was too thick.\u201cWe\u2019re getting phone calls from the police, asking us what could help identify him, what sort of jewelry he was wearing,\u201d Mr. Khalil said. \u201cThey won\u2019t let me come down and see what they\u2019ve got, when I\u2019d rather do that. We\u2019re in a limbo.\u201dWrite to Wiktor Szary at Wiktor.Szary@wsj.com and Jenny Gross at jenny.gross@wsj.comAppeared in the June 17, 2017, print edition as 'Fire Aftermath Draws Protests, Questions.'", "news_time": "2017-06-16 21:05:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/london-fire-death-toll-rises-to-30-1497612709", "news_title": "London Tower Fire\u2019s Aftermath Draws Protests, Questions", "keywords": " death toll, fire hazard, grenfell tower,grenfell tower fire, high-rise,london fire,theresa may,political,general news,crime,legal action,disasters,accidents,building fires,explosions,collapses,man-made disasters"}, {"content": "The Office of Government Ethics on Friday released President       Donald Trump\u2019s       latest financial-disclosure form, showing some of his real-estate properties thriving since his election as well as fresh sources of income from overseas.In the 16-month period ended April 15, Mr. Trump reported $37.2 million in revenue from Mar-a-Lago, the luxury Palm Beach, Fla., resort he dubbed the \u201cWinter White House\u201d\u2014$7.5 million more than he reported earning from the resort in his previous financial disclosure, in May 2016. The time periods covered by the reports include some overlapping months.Mr. Trump in the first months of his presidency spent several weekends at the resort, which earlier this year doubled its initiation fees to $200,000.The new filings also indicate the extent to which, although Mr. Trump has said he wouldn\u2019t initiate new foreign projects, he has continued to reap benefits from overseas development projects initiated before the election.Among those are a new India project in Kolkata that brought in revenue of between $100,001 and $1 million. The filings also disclosed substantial revenue from projects in Mumbai and Gurgaon in India.The 98-page document provides a glimpse into the president\u2019s vast holdings\u2014despite the selloff of some properties and all of his individual stocks, and Mr. Trump\u2019s outstanding debts. The disclosures report income and assets in ranges, and the income numbers are revenue, not profits.The Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N.J.\u2014Mr. Trump\u2019s summertime weekend getaway\u2014was shown to have provided nearly $20 million, while the Trump golf course in Sterling, Va., brought $17 million. Mr. Trump has visited the Virginia golf course on most weekends that he has remained in Washington. Those amounts were roughly consistent with what the properties brought in revenue on the 2016 report.The president also reported nearly $20 million in revenue from the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C., just blocks from the White House. Major donors and foreign business partners flocked to the hotel during the inauguration and since then, and Mr. Trump has frequently dined at the hotel with his family members.The largest source of Mr. Trump\u2019s income was the flagship Trump National Doral Golf Club in Miami, which provided more than $115 million in revenue, although that was down from the previous year.Total revenue for the 15 golf courses operated by the Trump Organization in the U.S. and overseas that report income in the filing was down 5%, to $300 million from $317 million. The Wall Street Journal reported this year that the value of Mr. Trump\u2019s golf properties\u2014a core part of his overall business empire\u2014hasn\u2019t kept pace with the amount of money he has invested in upgrades, according to property records.Mr. Trump\u2019s airline\u2014which his campaign paid $6.6 million over the last cycle\u2014brought in $7.7 million in income in the latest disclosure, up from $3.7 million on the 2016 report.Income from the president\u2019s 1987 book, \u201cThe Art of the Deal,\u201d rose to between $100,000 and $1 million in the latest disclosure, up from between $50,000 and $100,000 in 2016. Mr. Trump frequently touted the book on the campaign trail.In total, Mr. Trump reported between $9 million and $18 million in revenue in foreign projects in this year\u2019s filing compared with last year\u2019s range of $15 million to $50 million. This year\u2019s form listed royalties from a hotel in Vancouver as more than $5 million but didn\u2019t specify how much more.Those figures don\u2019t include the golf courses Mr. Trump owns in Dublin and Scotland, which provide him a large part of his foreign revenue.The filing reflected the loss of income from projects such as a planned project in Azerbaijan, which was canceled last year, as well as increases for the Vancouver hotel, which opened earlier this year.The profits from Mr. Trump\u2019s business flow into a trust that the president owns. He can draw money from that trust as its trustees\u2014his adult son and a longtime company lawyer\u2014see fit without disclosing it publicly. Ethics experts have criticized the arrangement, arguing that the president hasn\u2019t taken adequate steps to distance himself from his company.The report shows that the Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust funded a Capital One checking and savings account on April 12 with more than $50 million.Mr. Trump left his leadership positions in most of his companies the day before the inauguration. He left others right after the election, including Trump Project Management Corp., THC Jeddah Hotel Manager LLC, Trump Marks Puerto Rico II LLC and Trump Ocean Manager Inc.The filing appears to confirm previous statements by Mr. Trump\u2019s representatives that he had sold off his individual stocks.The president last year refinanced a loan, switching from a 6.18% loan he had taken out in 2006 to a 4.05% 10-year loan with Ladder Capital LLC for between $5 million and $25 million.Mr. Trump\u2019s latest disclosure wasn\u2019t required to be filed until 2018.

Mr. Solomon said he based his assessment on a review of specifications and technical literature on the product.The material, Reynobond PE composite panels, is manufactured by             Arconic Inc.,       which was created in a split-up of             Alcoa Corp.       in 2016. Arconic didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment.In order to meet the requirements, manufacturers must have their products tested independently.Without certification under the NFPA standard, Reynobond PE wouldn\u2019t be permitted in buildings more than 40 feet tall in localities that have adopted the standard, Mr. Solomon said. That standard, known as NFPA 285, evaluates the combustibility of complete nonload-bearing exterior wall assemblies and tests them for their ability to resist flame propagation.\u201cSo far there is no indication [Reynobond PE] was ever tested to meet that criteria,\u201d Mr. Solomon said.Fire-safety experts said the dozens of deaths in the London fire likely were the result of multiple factors, some of which were less likely to occur the U.S.In the U.S., state and local governments, rather than the federal government, are responsible for building codes. Independent groups such as the NFPA promote safety and other standards that local governments usually adopt, though they aren\u2019t required to do so.Under a model building code developed by the International Code Council, a group that seeks to promulgate common standards to be used around the world, the type of exterior finishing used on the Grenfell Tower cannot be used on buildings that are higher than 40 feet unless they have been subjected to rigorous fire performance testing, said       Rob Neale,        the ICC\u2019s vice president for government relations, national fire service activities.Reynobond PE has been used in a number of high-rise buildings around the world. Arconic\u2019s website highlights the 26-story Jumeirah Beach Hotel in Dubai, which includes 215,000 square feet of the material, and a 32-story Marriott Hotel in Baltimore completed in 2001. Shorter buildings also carry Reynobond PE, including a seven-story office building in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia, six public preschool centers in Detroit and several other low-rise schools elsewhere, according to the website.Arconic also makes a product with better fire retardant properties. Its site says that product is similar to Reynobond PE but has an extra layer of protection in the form of a fire-retardant mineral core and meets the NFPA 285 standard. \u201cThese panels meet or exceed national model building code requirements without exception,\u201d according to Arcononic\u2019s website.Specifications for Reynobond PE show it meets other fire-safety standards for the spread of smoke and fire. Mr. Solomon said those standards were designed to measure the flammability of interior wallcovering materials, not entire exterior wall systems.\u2014Susan Benkelman contributed to this article.Write to Josh Barbanel at josh.barbanel@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-16 20:10:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-fire-standards-limit-use-of-material-used-in-scorched-london-tower-1497658216", "news_title": "U.S. Fire Standards Limit Use of Material Used in Scorched London Tower ", "keywords": "cladding,exterior materials,fire safety,flammable,london fire,reynobond,siding,u.s. safety standards,Arconic,ARNC,Alcoa,AA,National Fire Protection Association,regulation,government policy,standards,standardization,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,disasters,accidents,building fires,explosions,collapses,man-made disasters,primary metals,non-ferrous metals,basic materials,resources"}, {"content": "Whole Foods Market Inc.             lost its edge, and now it is losing its independence.With a sale to         Amazon.com Inc.announced Friday, Whole Foods is entering a new frontier, joining the mass retailers from which it has long striven to differentiate itself.For decades, the natural and organic food retailer grew faster than the rest of the grocery industry by tapping into an emerging population of affluent urbanites interested in a new way of eating and grocery shopping. It had a certain cachet, with a distinct offering of organic foods and specially trained salespeople promoting an experience for which customers were willing to pay more.But in recent years, as mainstream grocers from         Kroger Co.       to         Wal-Mart Stores Inc.       began stocking more natural and organic food at cheaper prices, Whole Foods began to lose its advantage.\u201cThey didn\u2019t do enough to continue to command the higher prices,\u201d said Gaurav Gupta, a corporate-strategy consultant at Kotter International. \u201cTheir competitive advantage has eroded slowly over the last five years.\u201dFor nearly two years, Whole Foods, which has about 460 stores, has faced its longest stretch of quarterly same-store sales declines since it began trading on the stock market in 1992. Its share price had been cut in half leading up to Friday\u2019s announcement.Amazon said it has agreed to acquire Whole Foods for $42 a share in a deal valued at $13.7 billion, including debt.Pressure on Whole Foods, and its co-founder and Chief Executive John Mackey, mounted this year, when activist investor Jana Partners, with several allies, unveiled a stake in Whole Foods and publicly pushed the company to explore a sale. The new dynamic added to shareholder tension that had been more quietly bubbling, turning attention to the sliding results after years of being a highflying stock.Since it opened its first store in 1980, Whole Foods has prided itself on its independence. Mr. Mackey, a strict vegan, aimed to bring organic and natural food to the world. During the 1990s and 2000s, Whole Foods expanded rapidly, buying 11 regional health-food chains and opening more stores. As recently as last year, he spoke of expanding the chain to 1,200 stores in the U.S.Mr. Mackey said in a letter to employees Friday that Whole Foods\u2019 mission won\u2019t change. \u201cWe recognize this is very big news and may cause some uncertainty,\u201d he said. But just as Whole Foods popularized natural and organic food, \u201cAmazon has played that same role in digital commerce.\u201dHowever, Whole Foods\u2019 problem with how customers perceived its prices worsened in the summer of 2015, when the New York Department of Consumer Affairs accused it of overcharging customers in nine stores by putting incorrect weights on some items.\u201cThat was when these other competitors were really starting to ramp up, so that was when they needed to reverse that perception, not reinforce the negative perception,\u201d said Sonia Lapinsky, managing director in the retail practice at AlixPartners. Whole Foods\u2019 sales and stock never came back from that, she said.Some key moments in Whole Foods Market\u2019s history:Whole Foods put its efforts toward lowering its prices compared with rivals like Kroger. It expanded its private-label brand, called 365, to more foods and opened a new line of smaller stores called 365 by Whole Foods, aimed at offering overall lower prices.But it was too little too late, Wall Street analysts say.\u201cRetail is a really easy game when you\u2019re growing,\u201d said Paul Beswick, a partner and global head of Oliver Wyman\u2019s digital practice. \u201cWhole Foods reached the point where there wasn\u2019t a lot of easy growth left.\u201d It was forced to advance its operational capabilities to compete with mainstream rivals, and that wasn\u2019t its expertise, he said.Mr. Mackey said in an interview earlier this year that the company remains committed to its mission.\u201cWhole Foods is really this mission-driven company. We really do want to change the world,\u201d Mr. Mackey told The Wall Street Journal.Despite its efforts, Whole Foods\u2019 prices are still 20% to 30% higher than mainstream grocers\u2019, according to consulting firm OC&C Strategy Group. Earlier this year, Whole Foods said it was closing several underperforming stores and no longer aiming for 1,200 locations in the U.S.In November, Whole Foods said its longtime co-chief       Walter Robb       would step down, leaving Mr. Mackey to make swifter decisions to turn around the lagging business. Last year, Whole Foods\u2019 profit declined by more than 5% and its comparable-store sales fell 2.5%.Mr. Mackey moved more purchasing decisions to its Austin headquarters and made other organizational changes to operate more like a national grocer than a startup.But Jana Partners said it wasn\u2019t enough. The activists pushed for board changes and a slew of operational changes if the company was going to prove it could stand alone. Neuberger Berman, a mutual fund that doesn\u2019t typically speak publicly, and other investors were calling for change as well.Mark Bittman, the cookbook author who joined Jana\u2019s activism campaign as a consultant, said that Whole Foods diverted from its original mission to improve the quality of food people eat. \u201cWithout the mission, what is it? A fancy supermarket. And I believe that it\u2019s lost its way, mission-wise,\u201d said Mr. Bittman, who spoke on behalf of himself and not Jana. He added that Wall Street pressures caused Whole Foods to divert from its founders\u2019 intent to build a better food system.In May, Whole Foods moved to shake up its board, naming five new directors and planning to remove others by the next annual meeting. Jana, though, balked at a settlement offer that would have given the hedge fund only a few seats. That kept the public pressure on the company.Whole Foods and Jana declined to comment on Friday. Neuberger Berman portfolio manager Charles Kantor applauded the strategic move of uniting with Amazon, but also speculated the bid could be topped.The unique problems facing Whole Foods came as the grocery sector more broadly continued to grapple with a host of pressures. In recent years, consumers have been buying more of groceries through online merchants, with discounters and meal-kit delivery services all grabbing market share. A glut in commodities from grains to meat has brought down prices for many staple foods over the past 18 months, putting pressure on many retailers to lower their prices.Amazon brings an innovative, technology-driven perspective to Whole Foods that could help it improve, analysts say. Mr. Mackey will remain chief executive of Whole Foods and the stores will continue to operate under the Whole Foods brand and maintain its suppliers.Ms. Lapinsky of AlixPartners said Whole Foods risks losing some credibility with consumers because of the acquisition by a behemoth like Amazon.But, Richard Gerber, a former Whole Foods regional vice president whose Florida-based health-food chain was acquired by the grocer in 1997, welcomed the Amazon bid. He said Mr. Mackey was an innovator in their sector for a period, but that things in the industry have since changed.\u201cWe are granola people but it\u2019s about profitability. It\u2019s for your shareholders,\u201d said Mr. Gerber, who consults in grocery and is a Whole Foods shareholder. \u201cWhole Foods has been unable to find their way. They\u2019ve been lost in the forest for a long time and they haven\u2019t been able to reinvent themselves fast enough.\u201d\u2014\u200bDavid Benoit contributed to this article.Write to Annie Gasparro at annie.gasparro@wsj.com and Heather Haddon at heather.haddon@wsj.comCorrections & Amplifications   Paul Beswick\u2019s surname was incorrectly given as Baker in an earlier version of this article.

The cone-shaped device was to keep Khaleesi\u2014who is named after a character on the popular HBO series \u201cGame of Thrones\"\u2014from tearing her stitches out.San Vandenberg,        Khaleesi\u2019s owner, worried the cone was hurting her pet.\u00a0Its wide diameter and rigid material meant the puppy could injure herself knocking into doorways and furniture.\u201cHer face looked so pitiful,\u201d Ms. Vandenberg said. Unable to take her dog\u2019s whimpering, she purchased a bright blue inflatable recovery collar to replace the veterinary cone.Across America, many pet owners are doing the same. The new collars\u2014some made with velvety fabric and plush cushioning\u2014more closely resemble travel pillows. Other options for dissatisfied pet owners include cones made from soft, flexible materials and \u201crecovery suits,\u201d or onesies that cover up surgical sites.These so-called \u201cpet friendly\u201d devices are increasingly replacing what many pet owners refer to as the \u201ccone of shame,\u201d which veterinarians have used for decades to help cats, dogs, and even rabbits heal after surgery by limiting the animals\u2019 ability to lick, bite or scratch their wounds.Traditional plastic cones, which resemble upside-down lamp shades, are commonly called Elizabethan collars, or E-collars for short. They were named after the wide ruffs that Queen Elizabeth I often wore during the 16th century.Some pet owners complain the wide collars are uncomfortable, limit visibility, and often lead to unintended run-ins with human legs, door frames and other objects.Linda Markfield       started making softer recovery collars in 2000 after Sabre, her Great Pyrenees, had surgery on his tail and struggled to make it through doorways in her home. One night, she cut up a one-inch-thick foam exercise mat into a cone shape and wrapped it around Sabre\u2019s neck, securing it with duct tape.Today she runs All Four Paws, a Santa Monica, Calif. company that sells thousands of flexible recovery collars every year. Sales of her \u201cComfy Cone\u201d products, which are made of foam and colored nylon fabric and claim to conform to any openings that pets pass through, topped $2 million last year, she said. The cones retail for between $14.99 and $40.99 apiece.\u201cIt\u2019s not just that it works. It has to appeal to the pet owner because they need to leave it on,\u201d Ms. Markfield said.Share your images and stories with us on Twitter with #ConeOfShameCompeting products include the inflatable KONG Cloud Collar for Dogs & Cats that sells for between $9.99 and $17.56 on pet supply website Chewy.com. The Well & Good E-Collar, the rigid plastic version, sells for between $8.99 and $16.49 on Petco.com.At retail chain PetSmart, sales of inflatable and softer recovery collars have nearly doubled over the past three years, according to a spokeswoman.The alternative recovery devices have also found an ally among animal rights activists.Recovery from surgery is\u00a0\u201calready distressing for an animal, and hard plastic cones can impede\u00a0dogs\u2019 movement, impair their vision, and limit their ability to drink\u00a0and eat normally,\u201d said       Daphna Nachminovitch,        senior vice president of cruelty investigations at the non-profit organization People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. She said Peta encourages the use of softer\u00a0solutions \u201cwhen possible.\u201dPet experts are less enthralled, with some\u00a0vets saying the hard plastic collars are still the best option, particularly for pets nimble enough to squirm out of, or rip up soft collars.On a recent Friday morning, a greyish-brown tabby was wearing a semi-translucent plastic cone and crouching on a towel in the front window of Bideawee, a no-kill shelter in Manhattan. \u201cPoor Tigress,\u201d veterinary technician       Karin Michitsch       said, referring to the cat, which was healing from a dental problem.\u201cI kind of hate it, but it\u2019s effective,\u201d       Dr. Shian Simms,        vice president of veterinary medicine at Bideawee, said of the rigid collar.Long a staple in veterinary medicine, the recovery cone\u2019s poor image was documented in             Disney                   and Pixar\u2019s 2009 film \u201cUp.\u201d In the movie, Dug, a golden retriever that wears a talking collar, was forced to wear a cone by his pack leader, Alpha. It was Dug\u2019s punishment for not fulfilling a task he was assigned.Dug bowed and said, \u201cI do not like the cone of shame.\u201dBob Peterson,        who wrote Dug\u2019s dialogue and voiced the character, said he drew inspiration from dogs he previously owned. \u201cYou feel so sorry for your dog because they don\u2019t know why they\u2019re in it,\u201d he said of recovery cones.Alpha wouldn\u2019t have seemed as mean if he had made Dug wear a blown-up inflatable cone, said Mr. Petersen. \u201cIt would have been the cone of inconvenience.\u201d Dug ultimately got his revenge. Near the end of the film, he put the cone of shame on Alpha.For some animals, neither hard nor soft recovery collars are feasible. At the Denali National Park & Preserve in Alaska, sled dogs that patrol the 6 million acre park have been known to rip recovery collars to shreds.\u201cOur dogs hate the cones of shame. They can shatter them in a matter of minutes,\u201d said       Jennifer Raffaeli,        the park\u2019s kennels manager. She said cones make the dogs feel inferior in a pack and obstruct their movement in and out of their pens.The Denali dogs have at times used their hind feet to pull out stitches after surgical procedures. In lieu of cones, caretakers place booties on the canines or cover wounds with cotton t-shirts held in place over the dog\u2019s backs with elastic hair ties. Sled dogs recovering from injuries are sometimes placed under around-the-clock surveillance that can include sleepovers at Ms. Raffaeli\u2019s home.Ms. Raffaeli said she can quickly stop the dogs if she hears them moving and trying to mess with their stitches. \u201cThey pant all night long but they do love the bed,\u201d she said.", "news_time": "2017-06-16 19:41:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/guilt-wracked-pet-owners-try-making-the-cone-of-shame-more-comfortable-1497656515", "news_title": "Guilt-Wracked Pet Owners Try Making  the \u2018Cone of Shame\u2019 More Comfortable  ", "keywords": "cat collars,dog collars,e-collars,pet collars,pet owners,soft cat collars,soft dog collars,veterinarians,animal health,political,general news,health,page-one stories,consumer goods,nondurable household products,pet products"}, {"content": "Amazon.com Inc. said on Friday it would buy Whole Foods Market Inc. for $13.7 billion, including debt, instantly transforming the online giant into a major player in the bricks-and-mortar retail sector it has spent years upending.The acquisition, Amazon\u2019s largest by far, gives it a network of more than 460 stores that could serve as beachheads for in-store pickup and its distribution network. It would make Amazon an overnight heavyweight in the all-important grocery business, a major spending segment in which it has struggled to gain a foothold because consumers still largely prefer to shop for food in stores.In its drive to conquer consumer spending, Amazon has ventured far from its roots as an online book seller. It is developing its own delivery network, and has become a significant video content creator and cloud data service provider.Its Whole Foods deal is a blow to other retailers, notably             Wal-Mart Stores Inc.,        WMT -0.43%       which derives more than half of its sales from groceries and is struggling to compete online. Traditional grocers such as             Kroger Co.       and Albertsons Cos. have been battling volatile food prices, lackluster consumer spending and stiffer competition from deep discounters, online merchants and a plethora of other places to purchase food.Retail stocks including Wal-Mart, Target Corp. and             Costco Wholesale Corp.       sank. Amazon shares were up more than 2% to $987.71 at the close, near its record high.\u201cAmazon views grocery as one of the most important long-term drivers of growth in its retail segment,\u201d writes       Colin Sebastian,        a Robert W. Baird analyst. The acquisition gives Amazon a scale and density \u201cthat otherwise would have taken years to build out.\u201dThe deal came together in the past month, just after Whole Foods announced an overhaul of its board of directors, according to people familiar with the deal. The process was influenced by Amazon\u2019s own plans to build out a network that would have competed against Whole Foods, the people added.Amazon will pay $42 a share for Whole Foods, valuing the grocer at a 27% premium to its closing price Thursday, or $13.7 billion including debt. The deal is expected to close in the second half of this year.Mutual-fund giant Neuberger Berman, which owns some 2.7% of Whole Foods, and activist hedge fund Jana Partners LLC, with roughly 8.2%, had been pressing the retailer to add directors experienced in retail operations, technology, finance and real estate, and to consider a sale.Neuberger portfolio manager Charles Kantor said Amazon\u2019s bid could be topped by grocery companies worried about new competition. \u201cIt\u2019s not a big check,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cI would be very surprised if this is the final chapter of Whole Foods.\u201dAcquiring Whole Foods is strategic for Amazon, a way to quickly grab a bigger portion of the estimated $674 billion U.S. market for edible groceries, according to consulting firm Kantar Retail. Until now, Amazon has largely focused its grocery efforts around its Amazon Fresh subscription service, which promises quick delivery of online food orders.Analysts said they expect Amazon eventually to use the stores to promote private-label products, integrate and grow its artificial-intelligence-powered Echo speakers, boost Prime membership and entice more customers into the fold.Online grocery shopping is logistically complex, often requiring fast delivery of cold items as part of large orders on routes where stops are spread far apart. And many consumers still prefer to touch, smell and pick out fresh items like fruits and vegetables for themselves.Online shopping accounted for 2% of grocery sales last year, according to Kantar. Before Amazon\u2019s announcement, that share was projected to grow to 3% by 2021. Amazon\u2019s food-and-beverage grocery market share was estimated at 1.1% last year, compared with 1.7% for Whole Foods, according to Cowen.Now Amazon has to combine two distinct corporate cultures and leverage its full-scale entry into bricks-and-mortar retailing. Largely a hands-off manager of smaller acquisitions like Zappos.com, Amazon is likely to take a more active role in Whole Foods, Macquarie analyst Ben Schachter said.Whole Foods has come under fire as traditional grocers offer more natural and organic items, which are Whole Foods\u2019 mainstay. Its shares had lost nearly half their value since a 2013 peak, and sales at stores open at least a year had slumped.At first, the two retailers don\u2019t seem like an immediate match. Amazon is a low-price leader, while Whole Foods is a premium offering. Whole Foods\u2019 operating margins, at 5.5%, are higher than those of Amazon\u2019s North American retail business at 3%, Citi analysts note. The combined companies would be the fifth-largest U.S. grocery retailer by market share, according to an analysis by Cowen, behind Wal-Mart, Kroger, Costco and Albertsons/Safeway.John Mackey       will remain chief executive of Whole Foods; stores will operate under that name and maintain their suppliers, Amazon said in a press release.

The parent of disappearing-message app Snapchat closed down at its $17 IPO price on Thursday and rose 54 cents, or 3.2%, to 17.54 Friday, losing 3% for the week.Medical-robotics maker         Myomo               ended its first week of trading up 5.45, or 61%, at 14.45. Myomo was the first company to list on a major U.S. exchange through a provision of federal law known as Reg A+, which was designed to help fund small-business growth.Despite the recent wobble in some of this year\u2019s best-performing stocks, both U.S. and global equities had their biggest weekly inflows this year in the week ended June 14, according to EPFR Global data.Mr. Dewan said pullbacks this year have been short and overall volatility has been low because of the high cash levels he has seen among investors, with many clients waiting for any drop in the market to add to their stockholdings.Fund managers surveyed by Bank of America increased cash in their portfolios in June, bringing their cash allocations well above the historical average.Energy stocks rose Friday as the price of oil rose slightly. U.S.-traded crude added 0.6%, to $44.74 a barrel Friday, but prices have fallen more than 11% over the past four weeks on oversupply concerns.The yield on the 10-year Treasury note eased to 2.157% Friday from 2.160% Thursday. Earlier in the week, yields dropped following weaker-than-expected inflation data, then retraced some of that decline after Federal Reserve officials decided to raise interest rates at Wednesday\u2019s meeting and signaled further increases.

But the rules did far more to ensure gainful employment for lawyers and government than they helped students.The Obama Administration imposed both rules after advisory committees of higher education stakeholders\u2014students as well as public, nonprofit and for-profit colleges\u2014failed to reach a consensus. Ms. DeVos on Wednesday ordered a pause while new committees consider changes to better \u201cprotect students from predatory practices while also providing clear, fair and balanced rules for colleges and universities to follow.\u201dAfter a federal judge in 2012 tossed the Obama Administration\u2019s first gainful employment rule, vindictive department officials imposed more draconian regulations that cut off federal aid to vocational programs\u2014nearly all for-profit\u2014in which graduate debt-to-earnings ratio exceeds 12%. A nursing program whose graduates finish with an average of $35,000 in debt and earn $35,000 a couple years out of school would fail.Many public and nonprofit colleges that educate large numbers of low-income students could have failed under the rule. The department estimated that about 1,400 programs serving 840,000 students would be forced to close. Yet many dislocated students would wind up at community colleges with far worse records.Then there\u2019s the borrower defense rule, which would have enabled borrowers to discharge their loans if they claimed that their college had duped them. Department officials would have both defended and adjudicated claims. Colleges could have been hit to pay for discharged loans, though the department estimated that taxpayers would also be on the hook for between $9.5 billion and $21.2 billion. Plaintiff attorneys would have made out since the rule banned class-action waivers and arbitration agreements. Imagine the cable-TV commercials soliciting clients.While the rule technically applied to all colleges, department officials would have had enormous discretion. While bureaucrats might let, say, NYU off the hook for misrepresenting graduate outcomes,             DeVry University                   probably wouldn\u2019t be as lucky. Yet even many nonprofits and public colleges were worried about how the rule could apply to them.One irony is that many more students might be gainfully employed today if the Obama Administration hadn\u2019t spent so much energy pursuing an ideological crusade against for-profits. Any new rule should hold colleges equally accountable.

I first met him over lunch in 1986, when he was working on the book that would be his magnum opus, \u201cA Peace to End All Peace: The Fall of the Ottoman Empire and the Creation of the Modern Middle East.\u201d That book, about how France and Britain endeavored to impose a new political dispensation on the Middle East in the aftermath of World War I, was published in 1989, to near universal commendation.All of Fromkin\u2019s signature virtues were on display in \u201cA Peace to End All Peace.\u201d It was the product of prodigious but lightly worn research. It was politically canny about the realities of power (Fromkin had been a student of       Hans Morgenthau       at the University of Chicago). And it was beautifully written. It is worth stressing this last point. He commanded a light, allegro prose, spare but deeply evocative, clear as an Alpine spring.\u201cA Peace to End All Peace\u201d was also shot through with a recurring leitmotif typical of Fromkin, at once nostalgic and admonitory. The nostalgia focused on the lost sense of innocence and amplitude that marked the decade before the outbreak of war in the summer of 1914\u2014\u201cEurope\u2019s Last Summer,\u201d as he put it in the title of his 2004 book about who started the Great War. (Spoiler: there were really two wars. One was started by the Hapsburg Empire when it attacked Serbia, the other by the Germans.)The innocence had to do with the political easiness of the time. The opening decade of the 20th century was a time of apogees and consummations. There was a shared sense, Fromkin wrote in his book \u201cThe Independence of Nations\u201d (1981), that Europe, finally, at last, had become civilized. Sweetness and light reigned, and would reign, forever. He quotes the historian A.J.P. Taylor: \u201cUntil August 1914, a sensible, law-abiding Englishman could pass through life and hardly notice the existence of the state. .\u00a0.\u00a0. He could live where he liked and as he liked. He had no official number or identity card.\u201d For the most part, there were no passports. One didn\u2019t even need a business card when traveling. A personal card would do. This was an age before the income tax, before exchange controls and customs barriers. In many ways, Fromkin notes, there was more globalization than there is now.There was also immensely more security\u2014or so it seemed. In several of his books, Fromkin quotes a melancholy passage from the Austrian author       Stefan Zweig       about the decade before the Great War: \u201cThe Golden Age of Security,\u201d he called it, \u201cEverything in our almost thousand-year-old Austrian monarchy seemed based on permanency.\u201dExcept, of course, that it wasn\u2019t. The admonitory current that flows through Fromkin\u2019s writing has to do with the real permanencies in life: the intransigence of competing cultures, the unyielding imperatives of power, the awful awakenings of shattered illusions. It is appropriate that one of his abiding passions was ancient Greek civilization\u2014he was involved in several archaeological digs in the islands off the Turkish coast\u2014for the old teaching that nemesis was the inevitable result of hubris was a recurring theme in his work.In politics, Fromkin was a species of Democrat that scarcely exists today. He was an unapologetic American patriot of decidedly cosmopolitan tastes. He adulated       FDR       and clear-eyed, disabused politicians like Scoop Jackson and       Pat Moynihan.       He admired much about       Bill Clinton,        was repelled by Mr. Clinton\u2019s wife, and regarded       Barack Obama       with a mixture of curiosity and revulsion (though he undoubtedly voted for him). Unlike so many politicians of both parties today, he had the supreme political wisdom to understand that when politics becomes all-important it has failed in its primary duty: to safeguard and promote the good life.Looking back on it now, it seems significant that my first meeting with David should have been over lunch. Like a character in the cartoon Tottering-by-Gently, David was a man who never knowingly underlunched. His nostalgia for the glittering cornucopia of antebellum Europe was an expression of a gentle but thoroughgoing hedonism. When it came to food and wine, David knew the best and wanted the best. For his friends, this had the gratifying result that they, too, encountered the best.It is one of my regrets that I did not know David during the years that he owned a restaurant in Paris with his friend       Steven Spurrier,        the great wine connoisseur. I especially wish I had been on hand for the competition he organized to determine which was better, duck or goose p\u00e2t\u00e9 de foie gras. The details of the competition are lost in the mists of time, but I do recall that the event involved sending someone by plane and motorcycle to procure the requisite truffles in Italy.

But the rate requests by major insurers show stress on the marketplaces stretches beyond those trouble spots.The biggest ACA-plan insurers in Delaware, Virginia and Maryland are asking for average increases greater than 30% for next year. In Oregon, North Carolina and Maine, the rate proposals from market leaders were around 20% or higher.The insurers\u2019 proposals reflect continuing struggles under the 2010 health law to enroll enough healthy people to offset the costs of the sick\u2014but also uncertainty\u00a0at the federal level about the\u00a0law\u2019s\u00a0future. Insurers are particularly concerned about the fate of federal government payments that are used to reduce out-of-pocket costs like deductibles for low-income ACA-plan enrollees, which the Trump administration has threatened to halt, and enforcement of the individual mandate meant to prod young, healthy people to buy insurance.\u201cIt\u2019s still a very volatile market,\u201d said Rick Notter, an executive at Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan. \u201cThere are so many uncertainties.\u201d The market in his state isn\u2019t stable, he said, but the problems are being exacerbated by the lack of clarity in Washington. For health-maintenance-organization plans, the insurer seeks a 22.6% increase if the federal cost-sharing payments end, or 13.8% if they don\u2019t.A new survey of health insurers by consulting firm Oliver Wyman, a unit of\u00a0            Marsh & McLennan Co      s., found that 43% were planning to propose rate increases greater than 20%, while another 36% were looking at boosts of between 10% and 20%. The average rate increase in the May survey, with responses from 14 insurers, was around 20%. Nearly all of the responses assumed that the cost-sharing payments would continue\u2014if they didn\u2019t, insurers said they would either seek further increases or withdraw from the market.Insurers\u2019 rate proposals, which often need to be approved by regulators before going into effect, are likely to give fodder to both Republicans and Democrats in the argument over the ACA.Republicans, who have passed a health-care bill through the House and are trying to do so in the Senate, have pointed to insurers\u2019 struggles as signs of problems with the current law. \u201cThe laws of economics were in place long before today. These companies were losing hundreds of millions of dollars,\u201d a White House official said.Democrats argue that the markets would be poised to stabilize, but Republicans are hurting the marketplaces by threatening the cost-sharing payments and raising questions about enforcement of the ACA\u2019s coverage mandate.\u201cThese actions, these statements, these inactions, this uncertainty, has created a huge set of chaos in the individual marketplace leading to instability for insurance carriers, higher premiums, and reduced competition,\u201d said Sen. Tim Kaine (D., Va.) on the Senate floor Thursday.The insurance industry\u2019s stance on replacing the ACA has been somewhat muted, though it has sought some changes, including the repeal of a tax on insurance plans included in the current health law. Insurers have also said that if the cost-sharing payments aren\u2019t locked in, they expect rate increases and pullbacks from the exchanges.On Friday a bipartisan group of governors sent a letter to the Senate leadership urging Congress to focus on ways to stabilize the private insurance market.Some of the biggest rate increases reflect a combination of lingering issues in the marketplaces and federal uncertainty. In Maryland, CareFirst\u00a0BlueCross BlueShield\u00a0is proposing a 52% average increase, which it said will need to go even higher if cost-sharing payments aren\u2019t guaranteed. The insurer, which said it has been losing money on the exchanges, said its rates have been falling short of the costs of the relatively unhealthy group of people it enrolled.Also, CareFirst believes even more healthy people will drop out because they don\u2019t think they will face penalties for lacking coverage. CareFirst said it thinks consumers don\u2019t believe the Trump administration will enforce the mandate, and the House Republican bill would officially end enforcement, if it becomes law.\u201cThe attempt to get back to basic adequacy, together with a worsening risk pool, together with federal actions that lead to uncertainty, that\u2019s what causes it,\u201d said       Chet Burrell,        CareFirst\u2019s chief executive.In Delaware, Highmark Health said about a third of the 33.6% rate increase it seeks is due to projected loss of the cost-sharing payments and concerns about the individual coverage mandate, with the rest tied to the need to catch up to higher-than-expected costs that have been generating losses, among other factors. Highmark, set to be the only remaining exchange insurer in Delaware after Aetna Inc.\u2019s withdrawal, said it is still weighing whether it can even offer marketplace plans in the state. \u201cWe have to let the next several months play out,\u201d said\u00a0Alexis Miller, a Highmark senior vice president.Other insurers said they were seeing signs that markets were steadying and rate increases could be limited\u2014if the federal cost-sharing payments were locked in. In New York, nonprofit Fidelis Care seeks an increase of 8.48%. Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Vermont wants 12.7% in that state. And Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina said its requested 22.9% boost would have been 8.8% if it could rely on the federal funds.\u201cThere is no evidence to suggest [cost-sharing payments] will be available,\u201d said       Brad Wilson,        chief executive of the North Carolina insurer.Insurers are also worried that if they put more rate increases into place, it will lead even more healthy people to drop their coverage, pushing rates up further in the future as there are fewer premiums to offset the higher costs of covering sicker policyholders. Many consumers\u2019 premiums are largely funded by federal subsidies under the ACA, but some people bear the full brunt of premium rises\u2014and may not stick around as the rates go up.Kevin Lewis,        chief executive of Maine Community Health Options, said its 19.6% requested increase is linked closely to expected lack of coverage mandate enforcement.\u201cIt\u2019s the classic case of people who are healthier jumping out of the market,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a self-fulfilling prophecy.\u201d\u2014Stephanie Armour contributed to this article.Write to Anna Wilde Mathews at anna.mathews@wsj.com and Louise Radnofsky at louise.radnofsky@wsj.comAppeared in the June 17, 2017, print edition as 'Health Insurers Seek Big Premium Increases.'", "news_time": "2017-06-16 19:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/insurers-look-to-ramp-up-premiums-in-health-law-exchanges-1497605403", "news_title": "Insurers Look to Ramp Up Premiums in Health Law Exchanges", "keywords": "affordable care act,health care exchanges,health insurance exchanges,obamacare,premiums,political,general news,society,community,health,welfare,social services,insurance,non-life insurance,medical insurance,financial services"}, {"content": "One of the most prominent pension fund managers in the U.S. is leaving to run one of the country\u2019s largest college endowments\u2014without leaving his state.Thomas Britton \u201cBritt\u201d Harris IV,        chief investment officer of The Teacher Retirement System of Texas, was named Friday as the new chief executive officer and investment chief for the\u00a0University of Texas/Texas A&M Investment Management Company.The Teacher Retirement System has $140 billion in assets.

Barely a week after       James Comey       admitted leaking a memo to tee up a special counsel against       Donald Trump,        multiple news reports based on leaks confirm that special counsel       Robert Mueller       is investigating the President for obstruction of justice. You don\u2019t have to be a Trump partisan to have concerns about where all of this headed.President Trump has reportedly stepped back this week from his temptation to fire Mr. Mueller, and that\u2019s the right decision. The chief executive has the constitutional power to fire a special counsel through the chain of command at the Justice Department, but doing so would be a political debacle by suggesting he has something to hide.Deputy Attorney General       Rod Rosenstein,        who appointed Mr. Mueller, would surely resign, and other officials might resign as well until someone at Justice fulfilled Mr. Trump\u2019s orders. The President\u2019s opponents would think it\u2019s Christmas. The dismissal would put the President\u2019s political allies in a terrible spot and further distract from what are make-or-break months for his agenda on Capitol Hill. His tweets attacking the probe are also counterproductive, but by now we know he won\u2019t stop.There are nonetheless good reasons to raise questions about Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation, and those concerns are growing as we learn more about his close ties to Mr. Comey, some of his previous behavior, and the people he has hired for his special counsel staff. The country needs a fair investigation of the facts, not a vendetta to take down Mr. Trump or vindicate the tribe of career prosecutors and FBI agents to which Messrs. Mueller and Comey belong.Start with the fact that Mr. Comey told the Senate last week that he asked a buddy to leak his memo about Mr. Trump specifically \u201cbecause I thought that might prompt the appointment of a special counsel.\u201d Did Mr. Comey then suggest Mr. Mueller\u2019s name to Mr. Rosenstein? He certainly praised Mr. Mueller to the skies at his Senate hearing.The two former FBI directors are long-time friends who share a similar personal righteousness. Mr. Mueller, then running the FBI, joined Mr. Comey, then Deputy Attorney General, in threatening to resign in 2004 over       George W. Bush\u2019s       antiterror wiretaps.Less well known is how Mr. Mueller resisted direction from the White House in 2006 after he sent agents with a warrant to search then Democratic Rep.       William Jefferson\u2019s       congressional office on a Saturday night without seeking legislative-branch permission. The unprecedented raid failed to distinguish between documents relevant to corruption and those that were part of legislative deliberation. GOP Speaker       Dennis Hastert       rightly objected to this as an executive violation of the separation of powers and took his concerns to Mr. Bush.The President asked his chief of staff,       Joshua Bolten,        to ask Mr. Mueller to return the Jefferson documents that he could seek again through regular channels, but the FBI chief refused. Attorney General       Alberto Gonzales       was also unable to move the FBI director. When Mr. Bolten asked again, Mr. Mueller said he wouldn\u2019t tolerate political interference in a criminal probe, as if the Republican Mr. Bush was trying to protect a corrupt Democrat. Mr. Mueller threatened to resign, and the dispute was settled only after Mr. Bush ordered the seized documents sealed for 45 days until Congress and Mr. Mueller could work out a compromise.The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals later ruled that the FBI raid had violated the Constitution\u2019s Speech or Debate Clause and Mr. Jefferson\u2019s \u201cnon-disclosure privilege\u201d as a Member of Congress, though the court let Justice keep the documents citing Supreme Court precedent on the exclusionary rule for collecting evidence.We relate all this because it shows how Mr. Mueller let his prosecutorial willfulness interfere with proper constitutional and executive-branch procedure. This showed bad judgment. He shares this habit with Mr. Comey.Meanwhile, Mr. Mueller\u2019s staff appointments suggest that he is preparing for a long prosecutorial campaign. One unusual choice is       Michael Dreeben,        a highly regarded Deputy Solicitor General whose expertise is criminal law and the Constitution. He is not a prosecutor or counter-intelligence expert. Is Mr. Dreeben on hand to make a legal case for impeachment?The special counsel has also recruited       Andrew Weissmann,        who oversaw the Enron Task Force and led the prosecution of the       Arthur Andersen       accounting firm. The Supreme Court unanimously overturned Andersen\u2019s conviction, though too late for Andersen\u2019s 28,000 U.S. employees.Mr. Weissmann has donated to       Hillary Clinton\u2019s       political campaign, but more relevant for this case he was highly criticized for his legal conduct over the years by the New York Observer newspaper. \u201cIn Andrew Weissmann, The DOJ Makes a Stunningly Bad Choice for Crucial Role,\u201d said one headline in January 2015. The owner of the Observer at the time?       Jared Kushner,        President Trump\u2019s son in law and now a White House aide.With that history, can Mr. Weissmann fairly judge the actions of the Trump family and campaign? And knowing that history, why would Mr. Mueller choose Mr. Weissmann for his prosecutorial team when the appearance of fairness is crucial to public acceptance of the result?As it happens, the Washington Post reported in its second big story this week that Mr. Mueller \u201cis investigating the finances and business dealings of Jared Kushner.\u201d A fair question is whether Mr. Weissmann is another Patrick Fitzgerald who won\u2019t stop until he nails someone in this probe.Mr. Mueller is widely admired and no one questions his personal integrity, but we raise these issues because the stakes for American democracy are so high. As we\u2019ve said from the beginning, Russian meddling in U.S. elections is a serious matter and Americans need to know what happened. If Mr. Trump or key associates canoodled with the Russians to steal an election, then he must face the likely consequence of impeachment.But the public has seen no such evidence, and the FBI has been looking for months. Instead we have leaks that the special counsel whose friend was fired by Donald Trump is focusing on obstruction of an investigation into an underlying crime that so far doesn\u2019t exist. In Watergate at least there was a third-rate burglary.Much of Washington clearly views Mr. Mueller as their agent to rid the country of a President they despise. Every political and social incentive in that city will press Mr. Mueller to oblige. But you cannot topple a duly elected President based merely on innuendo or partisan distaste without doing great harm to democracy.Richard Nixon\u2019s       road to resignation was painful but the facts were clear enough at the end that most Americans accepted the result. The country deserves no less concerning Donald Trump, no matter his character flaws. Mr. Mueller and his team of zealous prosecutors have a duty to bring a case based only on solid and conclusive evidence. Otherwise close the case with dispatch and move on.American politics is divisive and dysfunctional as it is. Imagine what it will be like if millions of Americans conclude that a presidential election is being overturned by an elite consensus across the vast ideological and cultural divide running all the way from the             New York Times                   to the Washington Post.Appeared in the June 17, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-06-16 18:54:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/robert-muellers-mission-1497653661", "news_title": "Robert Mueller\u2019s Mission", "keywords": "political,general news,crime,legal action,politics,international relations,domestic politics,editorials"}, {"content": "Why does a phone maker get into banking transactions?

He hasn\u2019t bothered to gather all his projects under a single stock symbol yet, but he sees them as interlocking. He is delivering satellites to orbit and wants to put colonists on Mars, a backup in case his other planet-saving efforts fail. Those include electric self-driving cars, home energy storage, traffic-easing tunnels and cyborg implants to help people compete with AI.What distinguishes Amazon in this group is that it\u2019s the company most willing to work on mundane, everyday problems. In the long run, this might be the smarter move. While Google and Facebook have yet to drive significant revenue outside their core businesses, and Apple is only just beginning to, Amazon Chief Executive       Jeff Bezos       has managed to create business after business that is profitable, or at least not a drag on the bottom line.One way he does this is by moving not just laterally\u2014from books to consumer packaged goods\u2014but vertically, through the supply chains that create and deliver goods. Thus, Amazon used its experience running its own websites to create Amazon Web Services, now a $14 billion-a-year business. And it\u2019s working on its own network of trucks and planes to disrupt UPS. Physical retail\u2014still nearly 90% of consumer purchases as of 2016, not including car and gasoline sales\u2014is just the latest frontier.This trajectory wasn\u2019t obvious 15 years ago. You couldn\u2019t guess that a handful of companies would leverage their expertise, talent pools and capital to eat industries outside their own, or that they would become planet-spanning conglomerates that are as likely to spin up their own Fortune 500 companies as buy them.The iPhone, Apple\u2019s cash machine, is only 10 years old. Mr. Musk\u2019s SpaceX was founded in 2002 and Tesla in 2003. Amazon started Web Services in 2002 and made its first big acquisition (Zappos) in 2009. Google founded its X incubator for far-out ideas in 2010, and Facebook only went public in 2012.Two things become apparent from this timeline: First, it\u2019s flabbergasting how quickly both the revenue and the ambitions of these companies have grown. Second\u2014and this should really give us pause\u2014they are just getting started.What does a company like Apple, which has a quarter of a trillion dollars in cash, do with all that money? Anything it wants. The same is true for Amazon, Facebook, Google and \u201cElon Musk Inc.,\u201d an entity with so much marketing savvy and personal charisma that he is able to call upon the financial markets for fresh infusions of cash whenever he needs them, no matter the financials of his ventures.VIEW InteractiveA key reason these companies are behaving differently than their peers is that the fundamental technologies of the microchip, the internet, wireless connectivity, just-in-time manufacturing, robotics, big data, etc., have made it possible. Those with expertise in these areas can create businesses that solve existing problems in entirely new ways, or at least more efficiently and profitably. It also doesn\u2019t hurt when investors believe this to be true\u2014Amazon enjoyed a soaring stock valuation for more than a decade without reporting much in the way of profits.Here are some thought experiments: Will Amazon eventually sell you personal transportation? Will Apple start a bank? Will Facebook buy a cable network? Is Elon Musk going to build a standing army?And while we might like how these companies deliver services, goods and innovation in new and exciting ways, eventually we\u2019re going to have to ask ourselves, as a country and as a civilization, just how much power we\u2019re comfortable having consolidated in the hands of so few businesses.Imagine a future in which Amazon, which already employs north of 340,000 people world-wide, is America\u2019s biggest employer. Imagine we\u2019re all spending money at what\u2019s essentially the company store, and when we get home we\u2019re streaming Amazon\u2019s media.

The cone-shaped device was to keep Khaleesi\u2014who is named after a character on the popular HBO series \u201cGame of Thrones\"\u2014from tearing her stitches out.San Vandenberg,        Khaleesi\u2019s owner, worried the cone was hurting her pet.\u00a0Its wide diameter and rigid material meant the puppy could injure herself knocking into doorways and furniture.\u201cHer face looked so pitiful,\u201d Ms. Vandenberg said. Unable to take her dog\u2019s whimpering, she purchased a bright blue inflatable recovery collar to replace the veterinary cone.Across America, many pet owners are doing the same. The new collars\u2014some made with velvety fabric and plush cushioning\u2014more closely resemble travel pillows. Other options for dissatisfied pet owners include cones made from soft, flexible materials and \u201crecovery suits,\u201d or onesies that cover up surgical sites.These so-called \u201cpet friendly\u201d devices are increasingly replacing what many pet owners refer to as the \u201ccone of shame,\u201d which veterinarians have used for decades to help cats, dogs, and even rabbits heal after surgery by limiting the animals\u2019 ability to lick, bite or scratch their wounds.Traditional plastic cones, which resemble upside-down lamp shades, are commonly called Elizabethan collars, or E-collars for short. They were named after the wide ruffs that Queen Elizabeth I often wore during the 16th century.Some pet owners complain the wide collars are uncomfortable, limit visibility, and often lead to unintended run-ins with human legs, door frames and other objects.Linda Markfield       started making softer recovery collars in 2000 after Sabre, her Great Pyrenees, had surgery on his tail and struggled to make it through doorways in her home. One night, she cut up a one-inch-thick foam exercise mat into a cone shape and wrapped it around Sabre\u2019s neck, securing it with duct tape.Today she runs All Four Paws, a Santa Monica, Calif. company that sells thousands of flexible recovery collars every year. Sales of her \u201cComfy Cone\u201d products, which are made of foam and colored nylon fabric and claim to conform to any openings that pets pass through, topped $2 million last year, she said. The cones retail for between $14.99 and $40.99 apiece.\u201cIt\u2019s not just that it works. It has to appeal to the pet owner because they need to leave it on,\u201d Ms. Markfield said.Share your images and stories with us on Twitter with #ConeOfShameCompeting products include the inflatable KONG Cloud Collar for Dogs & Cats that sells for between $9.99 and $17.56 on pet supply website Chewy.com. The Well & Good E-Collar, the rigid plastic version, sells for between $8.99 and $16.49 on Petco.com.At retail chain PetSmart, sales of inflatable and softer recovery collars have nearly doubled over the past three years, according to a spokeswoman.The alternative recovery devices have also found an ally among animal rights activists.Recovery from surgery is\u00a0\u201calready distressing for an animal, and hard plastic cones can impede\u00a0dogs\u2019 movement, impair their vision, and limit their ability to drink\u00a0and eat normally,\u201d said       Daphna Nachminovitch,        senior vice president of cruelty investigations at the non-profit organization People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. She said Peta encourages the use of softer\u00a0solutions \u201cwhen possible.\u201dPet experts are less enthralled, with some\u00a0vets saying the hard plastic collars are still the best option, particularly for pets nimble enough to squirm out of, or rip up soft collars.On a recent Friday morning, a greyish-brown tabby was wearing a semi-translucent plastic cone and crouching on a towel in the front window of Bideawee, a no-kill shelter in Manhattan. \u201cPoor Tigress,\u201d veterinary technician       Karin Michitsch       said, referring to the cat, which was healing from a dental problem.\u201cI kind of hate it, but it\u2019s effective,\u201d       Dr. Shian Simms,        vice president of veterinary medicine at Bideawee, said of the rigid collar.Long a staple in veterinary medicine, the recovery cone\u2019s poor image was documented in             Disney                   and Pixar\u2019s 2009 film \u201cUp.\u201d In the movie, Dug, a golden retriever that wears a talking collar, was forced to wear a cone by his pack leader, Alpha. It was Dug\u2019s punishment for not fulfilling a task he was assigned.Dug bowed and said, \u201cI do not like the cone of shame.\u201dBob Peterson,        who wrote Dug\u2019s dialogue and voiced the character, said he drew inspiration from dogs he previously owned. \u201cYou feel so sorry for your dog because they don\u2019t know why they\u2019re in it,\u201d he said of recovery cones.Alpha wouldn\u2019t have seemed as mean if he had made Dug wear a blown-up inflatable cone, said Mr. Petersen. \u201cIt would have been the cone of inconvenience.\u201d Dug ultimately got his revenge. Near the end of the film, he put the cone of shame on Alpha.For some animals, neither hard nor soft recovery collars are feasible. At the Denali National Park & Preserve in Alaska, sled dogs that patrol the 6 million acre park have been known to rip recovery collars to shreds.\u201cOur dogs hate the cones of shame. They can shatter them in a matter of minutes,\u201d said       Jennifer Raffaeli,        the park\u2019s kennels manager. She said cones make the dogs feel inferior in a pack and obstruct their movement in and out of their pens.The Denali dogs have at times used their hind feet to pull out stitches after surgical procedures. In lieu of cones, caretakers place booties on the canines or cover wounds with cotton t-shirts held in place over the dog\u2019s backs with elastic hair ties. Sled dogs recovering from injuries are sometimes placed under around-the-clock surveillance that can include sleepovers at Ms. Raffaeli\u2019s home.Ms. Raffaeli said she can quickly stop the dogs if she hears them moving and trying to mess with their stitches. \u201cThey pant all night long but they do love the bed,\u201d she said.Appeared in the June 17, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-06-16 18:45:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/guilt-wracked-pet-owners-try-making-the-cone-of-shame-more-comfortable-1497626019", "news_title": "Great News for Pet Indulgers: The \u2018Cone of Shame\u2019 Can Be a Pillow", "keywords": "cat collars,dog collars,e-collars,pet collars,pet owners,soft cat collars,soft dog collars,veterinarians,animal health,political,general news,health,page-one stories,consumer goods,nondurable household products,pet products"}, {"content": "Peabody Energy Corp.        BTU 2.05%       is fighting accusations it colluded with police in the unlawful arrest of two protesters who took a photo with coal miners and their \u201cPeabody Abandons Miners\u201d banner at its 2013 shareholder meeting in Wyoming.The allegation brought by Thomas Asprey, 60, and Leslie Glustrom, 62, is the basis of a civil lawsuit that, along with a handful of other legal actions against Peabody, has been on hold since the coal company filed for bankruptcy last spring.Though a federal judge has determined their claims that Peabody interfered with their right to free speech and is responsible for the arrest are plausible, it is unclear because of the bankruptcy whether the case will ever end up before a jury.\u201cThey weren\u2019t climbing on buildings, they weren\u2019t turning over cars,\u201d their lawyer, Darold Killmer, said. \u201cThey just wanted to have their voices heard and they got arrested for that and got taken to jail.\u201dPeabody, whose shareholder meetings have been a rallying point for labor and environmental rights groups, emerged from bankruptcy in early April with a reorganization plan to significantly reduce its debt. Since then, the coal company has continued sorting through claims brought by employees, litigants and other stakeholders as is common in corporate chapter 11.Peabody said it was in no way involved in the arrest of Mr. Asprey or Ms. Glustrom and isn\u2019t liable for any potential damages related to their complaint, according to papers filed last month in the bankruptcy court.\u201cWe continue to believe the case is without merit and Peabody has no liability,\u201d a Peabody spokeswoman said.In their lawsuit, Mr. Asprey and Ms. Glustrom claim Peabody \u201creached agreements\u201d with campus police on how security at the shareholder meeting would be handled and allege the company had \u201cconsiderable influence\u201d on local law enforcement. They attended the meeting with their banner rolled up and say they quietly observed without incident.After the meeting ended, they said they were confronted by a campus police officer who demanded the pair move to an area on campus near the event hall that had been designated for protesters, according to the lawsuit. Mr. Asprey and Ms. Glustrom said they immediately complied with that request and went to the designated area, described as a free speech zone, where they took a photo with their banner.As they were heading back to their car to go home to Colorado, they said they were approached in the parking lot by coal miners who asked to have their photo taken with the sign. Almost immediately after they snapped the photo, Mr. Asprey and Ms. Glustrom said they were arrested by the same officer, Lt. Chad Trebby, for allegedly blocking traffic. They spent the night in county jail and were prosecuted by the Campbell County District Attorney for trespassing.Nearly a year later, Wyoming Circuit Court Judge Wendy Bartlett determined the arrests were unlawful and dismissed the charges. In her ruling, Judge Bartlett said Mr. Asprey and Ms. Glustrom had not been notified that displaying the banner outside of the designated protest area would be considered trespassing or could result in their arrest. The judge also disputed law enforcement\u2019s characterization of the photograph as activism, saying getting their photograph taken with the miners was \u201csimply that, a photo opportunity.\u201dMr. Asprey and Ms. Glustrom filed their civil lawsuit in 2015 against Peabody, the Northern Wyoming Community College District and Lt. Trebby. In court papers, the Wyoming Attorney General has said Lt. Trebby acted within his official capacity as an officer and said the law affords broad protection to law enforcement who have reason to believe there is probable cause for an arrest.Wyoming Attorney General Peter Michael and a spokeswoman for the NWCCD declined to comment.Based in St. Louis, Peabody chose the campus of Gillette College in Gillette, Wyo., for the site of its 2013 shareholder meeting. Peabody said it picked Gillette because of its proximity to the coal-rich Powder River Basin and North Antelope Rochelle Mine, the largest coal mine in the U.S. The decision rankled activist groups, though, who accused Peabody of holding the meeting in Wyoming to escape public scrutiny for business decisions they say threatened coal miners\u2019 retirement benefits.Peabody was facing questions at the time over a 2007 spinoff of its mining operation in the eastern U.S. to what became Patriot Coal Corp., which was in bankruptcy and used chapter 11 to reduce pay and benefits for thousands of miners and their dependents. Peabody later struck a settlement to fund retiree benefits.In court papers that sought to dismiss the civil lawsuit back in 2015, Peabody said law enforcement acted independently in deciding to make the arrests. The company\u2019s lawyers also accused Mr. Asprey and Ms. Glustrom of filing a lawsuit against Peabody \u201cto exploit the judicial process for use as their personal political platform.\u201dMr. Asprey is a retired electrical engineer who worked at             Hewlett-Packard Co.       and             Intel Corp.       and is a member of Citizens for Boulder\u2019s Clean Energy Future. Ms. Glustrom received a bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degree in biochemistry from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Their lawyer, Mr. Killmer, said they never expected to get arrested.\u201cWhat Peabody wanted was a rapid response to any perceived protest,\u201d Mr. Killmer said.Write to Jonathan Randles at Jonathan.Randles@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-16 18:37:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/peabodyenergy-fights-lawsuit-over-protesters-arrest-1497652645", "news_title": "Peabody\u00a0Energy Fights Lawsuit Over Protesters\u2019 Arrest ", "keywords": "banner, coal,environmentalists,gillette college,lawsuit,patriot coal,protesters,shareholder meeting,Peabody Energy,BTU,corporate crime,legal action,bankruptcy,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,corporate financial difficulty,political,general news,civil unrest,national,public security,risk news,energy,coal mining,basic materials,resources,mining,quarrying"}, {"content": "Dear Team Members,Today marks the beginning of an incredible new chapter in         Whole Foods Market\u2019s       history.

The rapid expansion of Amazon Prime plus the company\u2019s bold bets in the physical retailing world represent a constant cycle of customer-centric improvements and innovation.Before natural and organic food became popularized and quality standards didn\u2019t exist, Whole Foods Market served as the visionary and established those standards. Amazon has played that same role in digital commerce by developing services that have revolutionized convenience and delivery for consumers.We believe this partnership is going to create significant value for all of our stakeholders. This will enable us to be even more customer-centric and explore new ways to improve the shopping experience. Our Team Members will continue to see many opportunities for learning and growth. Most of our suppliers can expect to see increased business with us over time. Our investors are receiving a price that is 41 percent higher than our closing stock price on\u00a0March\u00a031. Whole Foods Market\u2019s deep commitment to all of our communities is going to remain as strong as ever, and our three Foundations can expect to continue to create value for their constituencies.While the transaction must go through regulatory and shareholder approvals and other customary closing conditions, we currently anticipate closing in the second half of calendar 2017.We recognize this is very big news and may cause some uncertainty. On behalf of the entire leadership team,\u00a0I want to assure you that Whole Foods Market\u2019s culture, mission and purpose are deeply valued by Amazon and the quality standards that we have pioneered over the past four decades will not be compromised.The Team Member Q&A provides additional information, but many details are still being finalized. We will share updates as soon as information is available to be as transparent as possible during this process. I will continue to serve as CEO, joining Amazon\u2019s worldwide consumer organization, and our leadership network will remain the same.As you know, we are in a metamorphosis phase. While everyone processes change differently, this is an exciting new step to fulfill our higher purpose. Together, we have built an amazing company and have positioned ourselves to deliver outstanding value for Whole Foods Market shareholders\u2014which includes many of you.As a fellow Team Member,\u00a0I believe the possibilities to extend Whole Foods Market\u2019s mission are virtually limitless, and I have never been more energized about what the future holds for all of us.Much love,John       MackeyCo-Founder and CEO", "news_time": "2017-06-16 18:31:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/whole-foods-ceo-john-mackeys-letter-to-employees-1497652305", "news_title": "Whole Foods CEO John Mackey\u2019s Letter to Employees", "keywords": " amazon, john mackey, letter to employees, q&a, sec filing,whole foods,Whole Foods Market,WFM,Mackey,ownership changes,acquisitions,mergers,divestments,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,retail,wholesale,food retailing,specialty stores,e-commerce,internet,online,technology"}, {"content": "College students are staying in school at higher rates than they did a few years ago, but the increases vary widely by students\u2019 race or ethnicity, and whether they are enrolled full-time or part-time, according to a new review of school enrollment data.Overall, 73.4% of students who entered U.S. colleges in fall 2015 came back to school\u2014any school\u2014the following fall, according to an analysis of 3.7 million students by the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center, a nonprofit higher-education research organization. And 61.1% re-enrolled at the same institution. Both those numbers have edged up by about 2 percentage points over the past six years.Asian students are the most likely to return, with more than 84% returning to school last fall, and 72.9% returning to the same school. In comparison, 66.9% of black students returned to any school and 54.5% went back to the same school. White students came back to any school at a rate of 79.2%, and 72.5% of Hispanic students went back to any school for a second fall.This is the first year that the clearinghouse broke down the levels, known as persistence and retention, by race or ethnicity, and the detailed data represent the pathways of more than 2.9 million students.Low persistence rates, which measure students returning to any school, can be an indication of financial challenges, with students unable to cover costs after the first year. Many schools front-load financial aid, with more generous packages for the first year. Students also opt not to return to the same school\u2014tracked in the retention rate\u2014when they have received poor advice on which institution to attend or what classes to take, or aren\u2019t prepared academically or socially to handle college life.Wide gaps in school-return rates also exist depending on whether students started going full-time or part-time. Nearly 83% of students who began attending college full-time in fall 2015 enrolled somewhere the following fall. And while the rates for part-time students have been increasing in recent years, they still lag behind full-time students\u2019 by more than 24 percentage points.Schools have been pushing students to enroll full time, knowing that they are more likely to come back and eventually graduate if they do so. A handful of institutions nationally are adopting a program launched by the City University of New York, known as ASAP, to incentivize full-time enrollment.Corrections & Amplifications   The persistence rate for white college students returning to school for a second year was 79.2%, and was 72.5% for Hispanic students.

That means the regulator can no longer object to fees received long ago, significantly reducing the amount it could force a buyout firm to give up. Before the decision there was no limit to how far back the SEC could go in seeking \u201cdisgorgement\u201d of fees.The SEC is investigating private-equity managers             Carlyle Group        CG 1.73%       LP and Silver Lake over large one-time fees from companies they sold or took public. It settled milestone cases over disclosure of similar fees against             Blackstone Group        BX 0.78%       LP and             Apollo Global Management        APO 2.97%       LLC in 2015 and 2016, respectively.\u201cMany cases involve disgorgement for periods substantially longer than five years to get to the numbers you have seen in the settlements,\u201d said       Jim Anderson,        a partner at Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP whose clients include private-equity managers.The decision affects the private-equity industry in particular, people familiar with the matter said, because private-equity funds usually last 10 to 12 years\u2014meaning the five-year statute of limitations imposed by the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling prevents the regulator from objecting to fees taken or expenses charged during the earlier years of a fund\u2019s life.Because of the decision in Kokesh v. SEC, the financial sanctions in any future settlement could be much lower than past ones. Companies that have already settled could seek to recover some of what they paid, observers say, although it isn\u2019t clear they would succeed in reopening matters they agreed to settle.The court\u2019s ruling deprived the SEC of leverage it can use in settlement negotiations with firms, according to a recent Debevoise & Plimpton LLP memo by former SEC Chairman       Mary Jo White       and       Andrew Ceresney,        who served as her enforcement director. Debevoise rehired Ms. White and Mr. Ceresney after they left the SEC. \u201cIn the past, parties may have faced significant disgorgement liability for conduct more than five years old and agreed to a settlement for a narrower time frame to avoid that exposure,\u201d according to the memo.The SEC inspected hundreds of private-equity managers beginning in 2012, after gaining authority to supervise the industry through the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial-overhaul law. SEC officials took the unusual step of lambasting the industry for what officials called \u201chidden fees\u201d that harmed investors such as pension funds and university endowments.The investigations of Carlyle and Silver Lake turn on a type of consulting payment known as monitoring fees, which compensate buyout firms for consulting and advisory services they provide to the companies they acquire. The agency has probed instances in which the firms took a lump-sum payment of monitoring fees from a company they later sold or took public, according to regulatory filings and investor materials. The one-time payment served to make up for years of consulting work the buyout firm wouldn\u2019t perform.Large private-equity firms often enter into contracts with companies they buy to earn monitoring fees for a set number of years, often a decade or longer. The SEC hasn\u2019t objected to the fees themselves, but to what it alleges was faulty disclosure that fees could be taken all at once when the companies are sold or taken public.Carlyle disclosed the probe in regulatory filings in 2016 and 2017 and said it was cooperating with the SEC\u2019s requests. A Carlyle spokesman declined to comment.The SEC began investigating Silicon Valley-based Silver Lake in December 2015 over its disclosure of monitoring fees, The Wall Street Journal reported in August. Silver Lake has told investors that it has no intention of settling the claims, but if it did, any sanction would be much lower than amounts paid by other big private-equity managers, according to records reviewed by the Journal and a person familiar with the matter. A Silver Lake spokesman declined to comment.When Blackstone and Apollo settled claims with the SEC over disclosure of accelerated monitoring fees, Blackstone agreed to pay $38.9 million in disgorgement and penalties, while the total for Apollo was $52.8 million. They didn\u2019t admit or deny wrongdoing.Blackstone, the world\u2019s largest private-equity firm by assets, has stopped taking accelerated monitoring fees. Apollo no longer accelerates monitoring fees and, for its latest fund, offsets any monitoring fees against the management fee it receives from investors, a company spokesman said.In another settlement announced in June 2015,             KKR                   & Co. agreed to pay almost $30 million to settle charges that it improperly allocated more than $17 million in expenses, hurting some investors while benefiting the firm\u2019s executives and certain clients. The SEC\u2019s order said the expenses were misallocated from 2006 to 2011, a period that includes some years outside the statute of limitations imposed by the Supreme Court. KKR didn\u2019t admit or deny wrongdoing.The court decision could affect other cases alleging corporate misconduct, including those targeting overseas corruption. In those cases, pursued under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, companies have disgorged income tied to allegations that go far into the past, according to the memo from Debevoise.A change in power at the SEC adds to the possibility that the agency\u2019s campaign against private-equity fees may be scaled back.       Jay Clayton,        the new chairman of the three-member SEC, is an independent appointed by President       Donald Trump,        while the agency\u2019s Republican commissioner,       Michael Piwowar,        voted against the settlements with Apollo and Blackstone. Mr. Piwowar declined to comment about the reasons for his dissent.\u201cBecause the commission composition has changed, there will be less receptivity to these kinds of cases,\u201d said       Michael Osnato,        a former SEC enforcement lawyer now at Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP. He added the agency could take the view that its prior enforcement cases accomplished the goal of improving disclosure of fees.Mr. Clayton, who took over in May, wasn\u2019t running the agency when the earlier cases were settled. But if he shares Mr. Piwowar\u2019s view of the investigations, the two could block the cases from moving forward or scale them back.

The new disclosure indicates regulators had begun to probe Fiat Chrysler\u2019s emissions practices within weeks of Volkswagen\u2019s crisis becoming public.West Virginia University researchers earlier this week revealed they had uncovered significant emissions discrepancies with the same kinds of Fiat Chrysler vehicles U.S. officials are scrutinizing, resembling findings they shared that helped uncover Volkswagen\u2019s long-running deception. Fiat Chrysler has disputed the university\u2019s findings and said it attempted to discuss them with the researchers.Earlier this year, the EPA formally accused Fiat Chrysler of failing to disclose emissions-control software on nearly 104,000 diesel-powered Jeep Grand Cherokee sport-utility vehicles and Ram pickup trucks in violation of the federal Clean Air Act. In May, the U.S. Justice Department sued Fiat Chrysler and accused the auto maker of using illegal defeat devices.Fiat Chrysler has denied using defeat devices and offered a fix it believes will address regulators\u2019 concerns.The auto maker said Friday the disclosed emails show it has been engaging with regulators to resolve the issue and reiterated its denial of intentionally undermining emissions tests. Fiat Chrysler said that it will \u201cvigorously defend itself in court against any claims that it engaged in any deliberate scheme to install defeat devices.\u201dByron Bunker,        the EPA Office of Transportation and Air Quality compliance division director, reminded a Fiat Chrysler official of the concerns the government had communicated to the company in the November 2015 meeting, according to one email dated Jan. 7, 2016.Mr. Bunker wrote that Fiat Chrysler\u2019s use of auxiliary emission-control devices \u201cappears to me to violate EPA\u2019s defeat device regulations.\u201d In a Jan. 11, 2016, reply addressed to       Chris Grundler,        head of the Office of Transportation and Air Quality, an executive at the auto maker urged regulators to \u201creserve conclusions on that question\u201d and noted the violation allegation has \u201cpotentially significant regulatory and commercial consequences.\u201dThe company has been unable to sell 2017 model year versions of Jeep and Ram vehicles built with diesel engines as it awaits certification of them by the EPA.

Share prices of food retailers from             Kroger                   and             Costco                   to             Wal-Mart                   dropped sharply in the moments after the news broke.But maybe it\u2019s the car industry and its frenemy Uber that should really be worried. Some see the deal as evidence of Amazon\u2019s craving for a brick-and-mortar presence, but the fattest bogey out there is getting grocery customers out of their cars and in front of their laptops.The average American makes 1.5 trips to the grocery store a week, spending an average 53 hours a year roaming the aisles. A British survey that studied in detail the reasons for car ownership\u2014and second- and third-car ownership\u2014found high on the list was the need to haul otherwise unmanageable grocery loads from store to home. Some 65% said grocery shopping would be \u201cquite\u201d or \u201cvery\u201d difficult without a car.In the U.S., an even more suburban and exurban society, the same is undoubtedly true. Trips to the grocery store are second only to physically transporting oneself to school or work as a reason for car ownership, and not as easily replaced. Traveling to school or work, after all, usually doesn\u2019t involve dragging along 70 pounds of irregular small items in awkward bundles.The British study found that even 23% of non-car owners used a car for grocery shopping, suggesting they borrowed a relative\u2019s or neighbor\u2019s vehicle. Add other food-related trips and the potential displacement is even larger. Daily trip logs kept by 7,665 Atlanta residents in 2011 showed, over a two-day period, 11,995 trips for food, 44% of which were to a store and the rest to some kind of eatery. Only 7% of these trips were made on foot.Not that       Mr. Bezos\u2019s       ambition is to substitute home delivery for outside shopping. His ambition is oriented toward accelerating consumer gratification however possible. If that means delivering an item to you wherever you might be by drone, he\u2019s game. If it means setting up kiosks and lockers so you can grab in an hour what otherwise Amazon would have to ship you overnight, fine.So what if some of this is uneconomic and effectively a loss leader? So what if free shipping encourages people to order inefficiently small numbers of items at a time? So what if lowering barriers to gratification engenders a higher-than-average incidence of buyer\u2019s remorse and elevated product returns?As every Amazon Prime subscriber discovers, even with these higher costs, the great genius of Amazon\u2019s business model is to encourage us to buy more stuff and, gradually, relinquish the habit of using the web as a tool of remorseless price equalization.Mr. Bezos figured out early that the great untapped gold mine of Amazon\u2019s business model, \u201cprice discrimination,\u201d would have to remain untapped. Price discrimination means using various methods to coax out of each customer the highest price he or she would be willing to pay for a given item. It\u2019s a common and even efficient practice defended by economists elsewhere in the economy, but Amazon customers have made it clear their trust would dissolve if Amazon used its copious personal information to turn its logic on them.In every other way, however, the Amazon promise to shareholders is founded on softening customer resistance to buying stuff without carefully comparing prices. Don\u2019t kid yourself about this. You\u2019re ordering sparkplugs? What a pain to get up and walk five feet to see if the cat food is running out. Just order more. Is the price on             Amazon.com                   really a bargain even with free shipping? I guess I could Google for a comparison but why bother?Whole Foods also built its success partly on, ahem, confusing customers about value\u2014especially the value of the nutritionally meaningless term \u201cnatural.\u201d But it\u2019s doubtful Amazon believes now it can rescue Whole Foods\u2019 own faltering success in this regard. The chain\u2019s same-store sales have been falling for two years. To the very occasional visitor, it still attracts young affluents in puffy jackets and designer hi-tops looking for dates and picking out a dainty handful of items. But serious devotees of household logistics can now fill their carts to the brim with organic milk and free-range drumsticks at Safeway or even Wal-Mart.Our guess surely is that Amazon, with $135 billion in sales, is not buying Whole Foods, with $12 billion in sales, to solve a Whole Foods problem. Only 3% of grocery shopping occurs online. The hassle of getting in a car and driving to a store on a crowded Saturday (when 41 million Americans do their grocery shopping) is one large area of anti-gratification in our retail economy. It\u2019s an area where, despite the best efforts of retailers, consumers still are careful about price and have a schlepping motive to ask, \u201cDo I really need this?\u201d If this is not a challenge the Amazon business model was born to take on, what is?Appeared in the June 17, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-06-16 18:01:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-will-free-you-from-the-minivan-1497650502", "news_title": "Amazon Will Free You From the Minivan", "keywords": "amazon,bezos,retail,uber,whole foods,Amazon.com,AMZN,Whole Foods,WFM,Mr. Bezos,corporate,industrial news,commentaries,opinions,wholesale,food retailing,specialty stores,e-commerce,internet,online,technology"}, {"content": "When I was a child my father took me to a baseball game, where a foul ball smashed a spectator in the head a few seats away.

One inning, as Maris took his usual place in right field, a man ran onto the field waving a broken beer bottle. He was yelling in slurred speech, \u201cNo son of a bitch\u2019s going to break the Babe\u2019s record.\u201dMaris at first ignored the man. But as he got closer and began waving his weapon, the Yankee slugger began to backpedal. The rest of us watched in disbelief. Somehow, ugly aggressive reality had intruded upon what was meant to be a field of play. Thankfully stadium security guards grabbed the fellow before he could do any harm and took him away to sober up. Hopefully he regretted his stupidity.I have since spent thousands of hours inside many maximum-security prisons, documenting daily life. Prison culture has its own rules.

Sure, critics could scream: In 2015       Paul Volcker,        a former chairman of the Federal Reserve, sounded the alarm about states and cities that used slippery accounting to \u201cobscure their true financial position, shift current costs onto future generations, and push off the need to make hard choices.\u201d But rarely have officials been made to answer for their deception.Until now. Last month a jury convicted       Christopher St. Lawrence,        the former town supervisor of Ramapo, N.Y., of federal charges including securities fraud in connection with the financing of a minor-league baseball stadium. Prosecutors have frequently jailed local officials for accepting bribes or stealing money. But Mr. St. Lawrence, who could serve prison time and is planning to appeal, is the first to face criminal charges for cooking a municipality\u2019s books. His conviction, part of an escalating federal enforcement effort, should be a wake-up call for towns, cities and states nationwide.In 2010 residents of Ramapo voted 67% to 33% against using public money to build a new stadium for the Rockland Boulders. So Mr. St. Lawrence concocted an elaborate plan to have the town\u2019s economic-development agency float debt for the stadium. But the agency couldn\u2019t actually finance all the debt: Mr. St. Lawrence was funneling money to it from town accounts. Then he tried to hide Ramapo\u2019s weakening finances.After assuring a bond analyst in 2013 that the town\u2019s budget was sound, Mr. St. Lawrence was caught on tape telling employees, with a laugh, that to make the numbers work \u201cwe\u2019re going to have to all be magicians.\u201d Prosecutors also accused him of recording on Ramapo\u2019s books a proposed $3.1 million sale of town property, even though the deal eventually fell through because the land was a rattlesnake habitat.Mr. St. Lawrence\u2019s lawyers argued that he did not profit from the transactions. They portrayed him as a well-meaning official guilty only of creative financing. But several witnesses painted a picture of Mr. St. Lawrence as a man who lied to raise money for a pet project and then tried to cover up the result.The former head of Ramapo\u2019s development agency, N. Aaron Troodler, was charged with conspiring to commit securities fraud and pleaded guilty. He testified at Mr. St. Lawrence\u2019s trial that the town had booked a $3.6 million payment from Mr. Troodler\u2019s agency for rights to the stadium land, even though there had been no such transfer.Ramapo\u2019s finances remain in disarray, and the town has struggled to pay its debts. But the acting supervisor says there\u2019s no way to know how bad the situation is until officials complete a forensic audit. Meantime, Standard & Poor\u2019s has withdrawn Ramapo\u2019s credit rating because of the town\u2019s unreliable financial statements.The jury\u2019s verdict ought to resonate far beyond Ramapo. Nearly 44,000 local governments issue debt, and for years the Securities and Exchange Commission, daunted by the task of trying to track their financial filings, did little to discipline public officials. But then came the financial crisis, followed by a rash of government defaults, including in Stockton, Calif., where one official described the city\u2019s bookkeeping as having \u201ceerie similarities to a Ponzi scheme.\u201dBy early 2010 the SEC had created a new unit to police municipal misconduct. Later that year, regulators accused New Jersey of misleading investors over a decade about its pension debt. No penalties were imposed, but the state was told to change its practices. Since then, the SEC has gotten tougher. In 2013 it charged Miami and the city\u2019s budget director,       Michael Boudreaux,        with financial manipulation that included shifting money among its various accounts \u201cto mask increasing deficits.\u201d In an unprecedented civil trial, a jury found both guilty, and a judge fined Miami $1 million and Mr. Boudreaux $15,000.With Ramapo, the SEC and prosecutors went a step further by bringing criminal charges. But this may represent the proverbial tip of the iceberg. Municipal budgeting is littered with misrepresentations meant to raise money for favored projects, increase spending during election years, or reward political supporters with rich contracts.

In spirit if not in distance, this is about as far as a guy can get from the bang and clatter of the film business. For more than 25 years the Academy Award-winning actor has visited New York and Los Angeles only when necessity demands. \u201cI like a good Hollywood party,\u201d he says. \u201cI have a lot of friends there. But I like living here.\u201dMr. Duvall, 86, and his Argentina-born wife, Luciana, live in a 270-year-old Georgian farmhouse nestled among wood-fenced horse paddocks, picturesque grazing pastures and turtle ponds on the 360 acres of Byrnley Farm. Still as trim and squared away as he was 45 years ago when he played       Tom Hagen       in \u201cThe Godfather,\u201d Mr. Duvall greets visitors in his elegantly appointed foyer looking fit enough to run a mile.Of average height and modest build, Mr. Duvall has never been what you\u2019d call movie-star handsome, yet he\u2019s played the lead as often as supporting roles. His hairline has been in retreat since his debut as the mysterious Boo Radley in       Robert Mulligan\u2019s       1962 adaptation of \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird,\u201d but he\u2019s never resorted to toupees, wigs or transplants, except when the character required it.From rhapsodizing about \u201cthe smell of napalm in the morning\u201d as the surf-loving Lt. Col.       Bill Kilgore       in       Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s       1979 Vietnam epic \u201cApocalypse Now\u201d to calling forth the healing power of the Holy Ghost as a foot-stomping Pentecostal preacher in his 1997 directorial effort \u201cThe Apostle,\u201d Mr. Duvall has cemented his legacy as a versatile film star. He won the Academy Award for Best Actor in 1984 for his note-perfect performance as the washed-out Nashville singer       Mac Sledge       in       Bruce Beresford\u2019s       \u201cTender Mercies.\u201d He has earned six other Oscar nominations. Yet Mr. Duvall says his favorite role was for the small screen: Augustus \u201cGus\u201d McCrae, the grizzled Texas Ranger he played in the 1989 TV miniseries adaptation of       Larry McMurtry\u2019s       \u201cLonesome Dove.\u201dLike most actors of his generation, Mr. Duvall idolized       Marlon Brando      : \u201cWhen I first saw him I said, \u2018What is this? What\u2019s he even doing?\u2019\u00a0\u201d Unlike most of his peers, Mr. Duvall had multiple opportunities to act alongside Brando, beginning in       Arthur Penn\u2019s       largely forgotten 1966 film, \u201cThe Chase.\u201d In Brando\u2019s dressing room, master and apprentice broke the ice with a friendly conversation. Then things shifted. \u201cFor like eight weeks he wouldn\u2019t even look at you,\u201d recalls Mr. Duvall. \u201cYou thought, \u2018Ooh, boy, we\u2019re going to be friends now.\u2019 But he knew you wanted that. He\u2019d just walk by. You\u2019d say \u2018Good morning.\u2019 He\u2019d just keep walking.\u201d Brando, he is quick to add, loosened up a bit during the filming of \u201cThe Godfather.\u201dThe son of a naval officer, Mr. Duvall spent most of his childhood in Annapolis, Md. His family tree, however, has deep roots in Northern Virginia. They were Union sympathizers who had to survive the chaos of the Civil War while somewhat stranded behind enemy lines. The actor\u2019s paternal grandfather, born in 1861, was christened Abraham Lincoln Duvall.Twenty feet from Mr. Duvall\u2019s front door stands a shagbark hickory with a trunk as wide as a train car. He doesn\u2019t know exactly how old the tree is, but it \u201cgoes back to the 19th century, easy.\u201d It almost certainly gave shade to the Union and Confederate soldiers who passed through en route to successive bloody battles at nearby Manassas Junction. \u201cWe thought it would come down during the last hurricane,\u201d Mr. Duvall says, \u201cbut it didn\u2019t.\u201dWith Confederate monuments and memorials being toppled across the South, a Northerner like me can\u2019t help but note that the street names in this pleasant village are heavy with historical freight\u2014Lee, Pickett, Stuart, Forrest. \u201cStonewall Jackson marched right through,\u201d says Mr. Duvall. \u201cBull Run is just down the road.\u201dToday the Old Dominion is a different kind of battleground.       Hillary Clinton       carried Virginia with 49.9% of the vote in 2016, but Fauquier County went 59.6% for her opponent. This is Trump country, not the kind of place you might expect to find Hollywood royalty.The mention of the president\u2019s name causes Mr. Duvall to stiffen. Ask him about football, showjumping or Brando, and he lights up. Ask him about politics, and his eyes narrow: \u201cI\u2019m not interested in making any statements.\u201dMr. Duvall\u2019s reticence is understandable. As one of the more famous Republicans in the motion-picture business, he is aware that certain political opinions can crimp a film career. Being an outspoken conservative \u201ccan be a very limiting thing,\u201d he admits. That\u2019s why he\u2019s always careful around the topic\u2014especially, it appears, with strangers from New York City.\u201cNothing has hurt my career,\u201d he insists. \u201cI don\u2019t talk politics, but nothing has hurt my career.\u201dIn 2008 Mr. Duvall campaigned for       John McCain       and narrated a video for the GOP convention. In 2012 he hosted a party at Byrnley Farm that reportedly raised $800,000 for       Mitt Romney.       Lately he has shied away from candidates and campaigns, but he agrees that actors who cling to the coasts may have trouble appreciating that there are two sides\u2014at least\u2014to every political argument.If you scratch beneath the surface in liberal Hollywood, \u201cyou can find some hypocrisy,\u201d he says. Such as the tendency of highly paid actors to sound off at award shows? \u201cYeah. I mean, how informed are they? How informed is anybody, really?\u201d he asks, his face turning hard. Have Hollywood liberals read       Thomas Sowell      ? Mr. Duvall has. Have they read Ayaan Hirsi Ali? \u201cI\u2019ve got a lot of respect for that woman,\u201d he says.When movie stars pontificate about politics, \u201cI get a little like this,\u201d he says, cringing. \u201cI want to tell them to take it easy.\u201d Heeding his own advice, that\u2019s as much as he\u2019ll say on the record. He hasn\u2019t survived a half-century in the film business by speaking freely with journalists.Mr. Duvall used his own Oscar acceptance speech in 1984 to thank the country-music superstars who inspired his \u201cTender Mercies\u201d performance. The validation of his friends       Johnny Cash,       Waylon Jennings,       Billy Joe Shaver       and       Willie Nelson,        he says now, meant more to him than any review\u2014though some of the criticism still stings: \u201cThere were people who really loved that movie, but there was a strain of people in Washington and New York who hated it.\u201d Anyone in particular? \u201cYeah,\u201d he says without hesitation. \u201c      Pauline Kael.      \u201dKael, the New Yorker\u2019s longtime movie critic, penned a review dripping with condescension of the sort lately called elitism. \u201cThe film is said to be honest and about real people,\u201d she wrote. \u201cMostly the picture consists of silences; long shots of bleak, flat land, showing the horizon line (it gives the film integrity); and Duvall\u2019s determination to make you see that he\u2019s keeping his emotions to himself.\u201dThirty-four years later, Mr. Duvall doesn\u2019t hold anything back when it comes to Kael, who died in 2001. \u201cShe was a fraud,\u201d he says, in a way that suggests he didn\u2019t mourn her passing\u2014or the passing of the time when a big-name critic at a major magazine could make or break a film on opening weekend.What else did Kael get wrong? \u201cShe put \u2018Raging Bull\u2019 down, which was a beautiful movie\u2014De Niro and Scorsese were at their height\u2014but then she lauded \u2018Bonnie and Clyde.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Though the latter movie is considered a counterculture classic, Mr. Duvall wasn\u2019t a fan. \u201cMy friends in the Texas Rangers said it was not accurate at all.\u201dIn the twilight of his long career, Mr. Duvall\u2019s regrets are few\u2014and specific. \u201cThey offered me the lead in \u2018Jaws,\u2019 but I wanted to play the other part, the fisherman played by       Robert Shaw,       \u201d Mr. Duvall says.       Steven Spielberg       told him he was too young. Mr. Duvall took one or two jobs solely for the money. \u201cI did a lot of crap,\u201d he admits. \u201cTelevision stuff. But I had to make a living. And like my wife said, \u2018It\u2019s amazing how you survived all these years.\u2019\u00a0\u201dMr. Duvall may be secluded here beneath the shagbark hickory, but he knows what\u2019s going on in the wider world. He reads history and is eager to discuss topics ranging from Ireland\u2019s neutrality during World War II to the relative horsemanship of the Boers vis-\u00e0-vis the Comanche. He watches cable news sometimes\u2014Mika and Joe.And he\u2019s still acting and developing projects. If he can get it off the ground, Mr. Duvall will star in the film version of Western novelist       Elizabeth Crook\u2019s       forthcoming book, \u201cThe Which Way Tree.\u201d He recently noticed that Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates had pledged $100 million to a World Bank fund backed by the president\u2019s daughter Ivanka. \u201cI thought to myself, \u2018Please give us $25 [million] to do this movie.\u2019\u00a0\u201dLet\u2019s say a Saudi prince called with an offer along those lines. Would he entertain it? \u201cMaybe,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t gravitate toward those guys.\u201dMr. Duvall visited the kingdom once\u2014with Wilford Brimley to watch falconry. \u201cIt was strange\u2014strangest place I\u2019ve ever been. We were there four days and no one came to get us,\u201d he says. The trip was sponsored by \u201cAmerican Sportsman,\u201d an ABC program. \u201cIt was weird. You\u2019d drive through [the desert] to go to the camel races and they\u2019d give you the wrong directions. You\u2019d see cars upside down with the wheels still going. You\u2019d come back and it\u2019d be the same, two hours later\u2014wrecked cars all over the highway.\u201d He and Mr. Brimley high-tailed it to London lest they, too, find themselves upside down in the desert.Mr. Duvall knows where he doesn\u2019t belong\u2014and where he does. Byrnley Farm is undeniably charming, \u201cchoice land,\u201d as a satisfied Mr. Duvall calls it. The air is clean, which he appreciates. Mostly what he likes about it, though, is that it\u2019s not the city. \u201cThe great Texas playwright Horton Foote once said a lot of people in New York don\u2019t know what goes on beyond the south Jersey Shore, which is true,\u201d Mr. Duvall says. \u201cI mean, New York is a wonderful place. But it\u2019s not the beginning and end of America. Nor is L.A.\u201dAt Byrnley Farm, the problems of the world can seem very far away. Does he worry at all about the country\u2019s future? \u201cNo,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ll survive.\u201dMr. Hennessey is an associate editorial features editor at the Journal.Correction  An earlier version of this story misstated the year of Pauline Kael\u2019s death.Appeared in the June 17, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-06-16 17:54:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-hollywood-legends-life-in-the-country-1497644085", "news_title": "A Hollywood Legend\u2019s Life in the Country", "keywords": "hollywood,robert duvall,steak,virginia,political,general news,arts,entertainment,movies,commentaries,opinions,interviews,reviews"}, {"content": "\u2018The prettiest lass you ever saw\u201d is how one of Natalie Taylor\u2019s ex-admirers describes the fetching English woman who provokes all the turmoil in Deborah Moggach\u2019s tense and splendid book \u201cFinal Demand\u201d (Overlook, 224 pages, $26.95). The 33-year-old Natalie, a frustrated resident of the dull-seeming city of Leeds, takes her beauty for granted: \u201cIf she put her mind to it, she could get almost any man. This face, this body was her means of escape; . . . she was destined for better things. . . .

The Germans are still there and, on the 20th,       Hitler\u2019s       birthday is celebrated, with defiant and unreal bravado in the Castle of Miramare, built by the Austrian Archduke Maximilian before he accepted the grotesque and fatal invitation to become the Emperor of Mexico. The palace is being shelled but \u201cthe luncheon is served\u201d and, thinks the High Commissioner of the Reich, \u201cit\u2019s nice to sit at the table; eating and drinking together makes you feel more like friends. Germans, Italians, Cossacks, Serbs, Croats, Slovenes. The new Europe of peoples,\u201d all of whom have been attached or have attached themselves, for the time being anyway, to the cause of the F\u00fchrer which is now doomed, though no one can say so.After the luncheon, \u201cCavalier Righetti, who organizes the sorting of goods looted from the homes of those deported, puts his hand in the pants of his driver . . . , a handsome young man and skillful driver, though it\u2019s hard to tell if he\u2019s enthusiastic about it or not. However, skirt or pants makes little difference, with things crumbling more and more each day. Even the sea carries the odor of putrefaction\u201d\u2014putrefaction of the spirit as well as of the body. That\u2019s how it is when regimes crumble but go on shooting and men and women change sides, so that everywhere there is corruption, bodies sold or condemned to slaughter.By Claudio MagrisYale, 349 pages, $26Readers of       Claudio Magris\u2019s       \u201cDanube,\u201d a marvelous travel book and meditation on the culture and history of Central and Southeast Europe, know that he is a discursive, demanding but richly enjoyable writer. The same qualities are evident in \u201cBlameless,\u201d ably translated from the Italian by Anne Milano Appel. \u201cBlameless\u201d is a novel, but in no way a conventional one, for there is no plot as such, no coherent narrative, and innumerable digressions. Characters flit in and out, and only the main ones are fictional. It\u2019s set mostly in Trieste, Mr. Magris\u2019s home city.Trieste was once ruled by the Republic of Venice, then was part of the Habsburg Empire of Austria-Hungary, then (from 1866) of the new Kingdom of Italy, and in 1945 was disputed between Italy and Yugoslavia before finally (perhaps) becoming Italian again. The seed for the novel was planted in Mr. Magris\u2019s mind by a Triestine professor who devoted his life to collecting weapons and all sorts of military material in order to build a War Museum, in the hope that exhibiting these \u201cinstruments of death\u201d could lead the way to peace. The unnamed principal character of \u201cBlameless\u201d has the same idea, but he is a half-crazy and disreputable collector of just about everything, scribbling notes and instructions on stray pieces of paper.Only toward the end of his life does he become more than an eccentric magpie. The transformation is the result of his investigation of the \u201cRisiera,\u201d a disused rice factory where the Nazi Occupiers in the last years of the war imprisoned Jews (and other undesirables), torturing and murdering some, dispatching others north to death camps in what is now Poland. The collector searches for names written on the prison walls: not the names of the victims, for these were documented by the mad bureaucracy, but of those who had betrayed or informed on the doomed prisoners. In the early pages of the book we learn of this collector\u2019s death\u2014he was sleeping in a coffin in the hangar where he stored his finds and was killed when a fire consumed it\u2014but much of the novel comes to us in his words, relating his memories and rambling thoughts.The other main character is a young woman, Luisa, charged with the organization of the Museum and faced with the onerous, near-impossible task of ordering and displaying the collector\u2019s \u201cdocuments, the disconnected notes, the letters or fragments of letters.\u201d Luisa, daughter of a Triestine Jewish mother and a Black American sergeant who served in the post-war Allied Military Government of the disputed city, is aware of her own family\u2019s history of persecution and of slavery. Long passages of the novel track the confused and disturbing story of her father\u2019s ancestors and her equally distressing uncertainty about just what her mother had known or suspected\u2014about what her own mother had done, or might have done\u2014in the last terrible year. Had she perhaps been a \u201cdespicable informer\u201d too?If the theme of the novel is the horror of war, a horror which is metaphysical as well as fleshly\u2014the horror of reeking flesh and desperate lust\u2014it\u2019s also the case that even the collector senses that his museum will alter nothing, no matter with what skill and devotion Luisa sets it in order. Who\u2019s right, who\u2019s wrong, in Trieste in 1945\u2014well, later there will be a time for forgetting. \u201cThe Resistance is a complex business and those who resisted multiply all the more as the years go by.\u201d That\u2019s how it is in war, and in post-war. Truth is slippery as mercury.\u201cBlameless,\u201d as the title suggests, is slippery too, slippery because it searches for truth, and the truth depends first on the angle from which you approach it and won\u2019t in any case stay still. It\u2019s hard to get a grip on this complex novel, and this is how it must be, because understanding depends on perspective, and perspective is as hard to keep steady as the waves that break on the harbor wall. The prose gallops but demands that you read it slowly and thoughtfully, the author\u2019s intelligence being resistant to summary. Reading \u201cBlameless\u201d is worth the effort, but it would be foolish to pretend that the effort demanded is not considerable, or that the reader won\u2019t sometimes feel trapped in a maze, where the center can\u2019t be reached and the way out is choked.\u2014Mr. Massie\u2019s most recent book is the novel \u201cEnd Games in Bordeaux.\u201dAppeared in the June 17, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-06-16 17:40:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/putrefaction-of-the-spirit-1497649216", "news_title": "Putrefaction of the Spirit", "keywords": "bookcar0617,book review,recommended books,books,political,general news,arts,entertainment,reviews"}, {"content": "In Tomoyuki Hoshino\u2019s novel \u201cME\u201d (Akashic, 239 pages, $15.95), a disenchanted electronics megastore clerk named Hitoshi swipes a stranger\u2019s cell phone at a McDonald\u2019s and then tricks the man\u2019s mother into wiring money into his bank account. But the joke is on him. Soon after, the old woman turns up at Hitoshi\u2019s apartment calling him Daiki, refusing to believe that he isn\u2019t her son and pestering him about getting married. A sobering thought for other would-be scammers: What if the fake identity you made up was the one you got stuck with?Stranger still, when Hitoshi goes to his own childhood home he\u2019s nearly chased off the property. There he finds a young man who strongly resembles him living in his room and going by his name. When the two meet\u2014again at a McDonald\u2019s\u2014Hitoshi comes to a realization: Their experiences match so closely that they might as well be the same person. He is a ME. And there are countless others like him.Part existential fable, part \u201cNight of the Living Dead,\u201d Mr. Hoshino\u2019s inventive novel, accessibly translated by       Charles De Wolf,        paints a nightmare vision of Japan\u2019s rootless millennials, who work grinding dead-end jobs that leave them little time for family or individual passions. \u201cThe image of a sardine floated across my mind,\u201d Hitoshi thinks as he considers his doppelg\u00e4ngers. \u201cThough I seemed to be swimming freely in the sea, I was merely moving my body in relation to the other fish around me. There was no sardine leader deciding in which direction we would swim. We merely conformed to the fluctuations of the school, expanding or shrinking, drifting off to the side or surging ahead into the distance.\u201dAt first Hitoshi and his fellow MEs are happy to band together against an uncaring world. But the camaraderie doesn\u2019t last, since every time one reveals a character flaw the others take it as an indictment of themselves. As the MEs\u2019 failures and weaknesses become intolerably magnified onto the \u201cliving but useless rabble\u201d they\u2019re gripped by a suicidal impulse that unleashes a crazed murder spree. The frenetic, knife-wielding finale reaches its climax in\u2014a McDonald\u2019s, of course. None of them can think of any place else to eat.Japan\u2019s laureate of youthful disaffection is       Haruki Murakami,        who rose to fame in the 1980s, particularly with the novel \u201cNorwegian Wood\u201d (1987), by depicting a postwar protest generation that looked for definition in serial love affairs and Western popular culture. Mr. Murakami\u2019s 1980 story \u201cA Slow Boat to China,\u201d about the childhood memories of a lonely and provincial Tokyo man, provides the inspiration for       Hideo Furukawa\u2019s       novella \u201cSlow Boat\u201d (Pushkin, 124 pages, $13.95). Mr. Furukawa updates the tale to Christmas Eve 2002, when a nameless narrator wanders Tokyo accessing his own fragmented memories.These center on a sequence of heartbreaks. The narrator recalls his first short-lived relationship in summer camp, the girlfriend he lost as a university student because his train stalled on the way to meet her at the airport and the beautiful chef who worked in his caf\u00e9 until a catastrophe drove him out of business. A mood of gloomy, wisecracking rebellion against the \u201cidiotic world\u201d pervades the writing. The narrator can\u2019t stand Tokyo but never manages to leave. Like Mr. Murakami\u2019s outcasts, he thinks \u201cthe Japanese language is nothing but lies\u201d and invents private forms of communication. He and his summer camp crush converse exclusively in movie dialogue.Translator       David Boyd       brings the slight and endearing story into riffing, confessional English. \u201cIf this was a kabuki play,\u201d the narrator says when things with his second girlfriend start to heat up, \u201cthis would be the place where the wooden clappers get faster and faster.\u201d Most of the time, though, he\u2019s at a standstill. \u201cHope . . . I still have hope. That I\u2019m getting out of here. But I have no idea where I am\u2014no idea where I\u2019m going\u2014and isn\u2019t that the same as having no way out?\u201dBut Japanese fiction isn\u2019t all alienation and haunted laughter.       Hiromi Kawakami\u2019s       \u201cThe Nakano Thrift Shop\u201d (Europa, 229 pages, $16) takes up the genre of \u201cslice-of-life\u201d storytelling that has found popularity in manga graphic novels. These books follow their characters across quotidian days in school or the workplace, charting their friendships and love affairs and generally arriving at some affirmative lesson about the richness of human connections. Ms. Kawakami\u2019s gentle, humorous novel, in an unassuming translation by       Allison Markin Powell,        provides the same consolations.It takes place in a Tokyo antique store run by the keen-eyed Mr. Nakano, who excels at turning a profit by buying and selling trinkets. As his earnest young shopkeeper Hitomi deals with his idiosyncratic customers (the most colorful is a gentlemanly Yakuza gangster), she falls for her coworker Takeo, a painfully introverted young man with an artistic nature. At times Takeo seems to want nothing more than companionship; at other times he\u2019s blunderingly intimate. Early on he has to make amends after sketching a portrait of Hitomi in the same pose and state of undress as Goya\u2019s Naked Maja. The book\u2019s setting, with its rare, delicate objects and back-and-forth bartering, provides a fitting background to their halting courtship.There\u2019s a feline quality to their relationship that readers of forthright temperament may find maddening. Remarkably little happens. The two conduct much of their relationship through text messages and awkward eye contact during work hours. When Takeo punishes Hitomi with a silent treatment after some minor lapse, Mr. Nakano\u2019s sister, the young woman\u2019s mentor, explains, \u201cWhat has happened, my dear Hitomi, is that you have stepped on his tail.\u201d Tails are routinely bruised. There\u2019s a lot of sulking.But gradually Ms. Kawakami transforms the relationship from childlike curiosity and sexual desire to deeper forms of love and appreciation. The eccentricities of the side characters add to the quiet charm of the couple\u2019s maturation. And there\u2019s not a McDonald\u2019s in sight.", "news_time": "2017-06-16 17:40:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-best-new-fiction-1497649235", "news_title": "The Best New Fiction", "keywords": "bookcar0617,book review,books,political,general news,generational cohorts,society,community,arts,entertainment,reviews,hotels,restaurants,cafes,fast food places,leisure,hospitality"}, {"content": "The Wall Street Journal/Times Higher Education College Rankings for 2016, published on Sept. 28, 2016, have been revised in response to a correction made by the U.S. Department of Education of its loan-repayment rate data.

It was performed to African chiefs in 1608 off the coast of Sierra Leone by the crew of an East India Company vessel. English players performed it in Poland at about the same time. The first German translation came out in 1620, but the first Chinese edition only in 1916. So \u201cHamlet\u201d is Western. But the idea that it traveled only as an opportunistic parasite on Her Majesty\u2019s merchant and naval ships deserves to be challenged. It traveled because its themes were universal.For evidence, one need only read \u201cHamlet Globe to Globe,\u201d by       Dominic Dromgoole.       Mr. Dromgoole was director of the Globe Theatre in London when he hit upon the idea of taking \u201cHamlet\u201d on the road to celebrate the 450th anniversary of       Shakespeare\u2019s       birth. Not a weekend in Edinburgh, or a season in Chicago: What Mr. Dromgoole had in mind was the entire globe. The theater\u2019s company visited nearly 200 countries and several refugee camps in two years, staging a performance in each place. They were a band of 16 players and stage hands. Their show was bare-bones, with two actors alternating as Hamlet, but they managed to preserve the signature jig danced at the end of all Globe performances. At the conclusion of each event, everyone in the company helped in the packing up and moving on.By Dominic DromgooleGrove, 390 pages, $27It is testament to how entwined our world has become that an undertaking       Jules Verne       would have considered overplayed barely raises a shrug among the public. On so many different stages, on so many different evenings, the company gave performance after performance, each unique; they were exhausted, exhilarated, puking with food poisoning, and only once, in Peru, came close to perfecting the piece. Miraculously, the company completed the tour intact, as one, playing at last to Queen Margrethe II of Denmark at Hamlet\u2019s castle, then to President       Barack Obama       at the Globe, which stands on the Thames, a reconstruction of the original theatre built in 1599.Mr. Dromgoole\u2019s view is that Shakespeare\u2019s plays are not intellectual, but fluid, shaped by the moment. The tour furnished several examples. At a new science university in Saudi Arabia, the company are among the first in the country\u2019s history to perform with men and women on the same stage. Mr. Dromgoole is invigorated to be among students developing new ideas: Hamlet is himself a student, at Wittenberg, challenging norms at the start of the age of reason. \u201cI\u2019ll speak to it though Hell itself should gape and bid me hold my peace,\u201d says Hamlet of his father\u2019s ghost, who comes with warnings of villainy and corruption. That goes for Mr. Dromgoole, too: In Moscow, he cuts off and insults a Kremlin prince who embodies all that he despises.\u201cThe cat will mew and dog will have its day,\u201d says Hamlet. Well, maybe. This is a dog\u2019s dinner of a book, poorly written, often banal, a hundred pages too long, and marked by a peculiar, regrettable absence of the actors and stage hands. They are referenced, lauded, but voiceless. Many are apparently writing their own books; glossed and reworked, their ups and downs, romances, and epiphanies would amount to a Netflix series. Yet this is nevertheless a winning book. \u201cIt is perfectly possible to be garrulous and to conceal,\u201d Mr. Dromgoole says of Hamlet. It could be his own mantra.It is worth pausing to applaud and consider the curious solidity of the Globe\u2019s eccentric and modern achievement. The solidity in large part comes from Shakespeare himself. The substantial will dissolve, Mr. Dromgoole argues, but the froth of words will last. The question is, of all of Shakespeare\u2019s words, why \u201cHamlet\u201d?Mr. Dromgoole is unequivocal. There are better Shakespeare plays, and few would wish Hamlet as a companion. But there are layers and layers of meaning and technical challenges in \u201cHamlet.\u201d It is both gleaming and futuristic, Mr. Dromgoole thinks, with a speed of thought never seen before in the English language.Hamlet fits in everywhere because he is the icon of restlessness. \u201cHamlet\u201d alights upon the timeless themes of power, love, madness, and war. To Mr. Dromgoole\u2019s modern eyes, war is vain and stupid, just as the Captain depicts it to Hamlet: \u201cTruly to speak, and with no addition, / We go to gain a little patch of ground / That hath in it no profit but the name.\u201d This is simple, but not so far from the truth. There is surely a case for       Bashar al-Assad       as Hamlet\u2014the mad, cruel, done-in scion going to gain patches of ground. \u201cHamlet,\u201d like the world, has plenty of action and killing. Except for the languorous South Pacific, audiences got it.Shakespeare was a product of a Tudor grammar school. His father was probably illiterate. He wrote plays disposably; sonnets mattered more. Yet even for those who have never seen the play, \u201cHamlet\u201d stands as among the most significant attempts made by humans to comprehend mortality, what it is to be alive and aware of your certain death. Near the play\u2019s end, Hamlet takes the skull of the jester Yorick, whom he remembers fondly from childhood, and begins a meditation on the body\u2019s corruption: \u201cTo what base uses we may return, Horatio! Why may / not imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander, / till he find it stopping a bung-hole?\u201d During this scene in an imagined Danish graveyard, Mr. Dromgoole says, camel herders of Somaliland, ravers of Taiwan, refugees in Jordan\u2014all of them leaned in.\u2014Mr. Ledgard\u2019s novel \u201cSubmergence\u201d has been adapted as a film by       Wim Wenders.

Keith Law,        a senior baseball writer and analyst for ESPN, is a member of the growing cohort of exasperated baseball analysts who persuasively argue against what they consider the bewitchment of the sport\u2019s intelligence by outdated or ill-considered metrics.The title, and especially the subtitle, of Mr. Law\u2019s book\u2014\u201cSmart Baseball: The Story Behind the Old Stats That Are Ruining the Game, the New Ones That Are Running It, and the Right Way to Think About Baseball\u201d\u2014indicates he did not get the memo recommending intellectual tentativeness. In today\u2019s garden of baseball journalism, the flora includes many practitioners who are not shrinking violets, and Mr. Law himself is a human cactus with a prickly impatience regarding those he considers slow learners.By Keith LawMorrow, 291 pages, $27.99Baseball is the sport with the longest season: 162 games before 10 teams play on into October, with two often finishing in early November. As a game of distinct episodes\u2014pitch by pitch, out by out, inning by inning\u2014it generates an ever-richer sediment of data as new technologies yield ever-more refined measurements: spin rates of pitches, \u201ctilts\u201d (angles of break) of sliders, launch angles of swings, exit velocities of balls coming off bats, and so on. These measurements are massaged by a new generation of mostly young and well-educated front-office \u201cquants.\u201d All 30 teams have analytics departments; the Astros have a \u201cdirector of decision sciences.\u201d Many of these savants\u2019 baseball-playing careers peaked in Little League. They work, not always harmoniously, with their teams\u2019 managers, who are expected to use the data when putting together lineups and making in-game decisions.Mr. Law\u2019s demolition derby begins by disparaging the hitting and pitching metrics we grew up reading beneath the bubblegum residue on the backs of baseball cards\u2014batting averages, runs batted in, wins, saves, fielding percentage. For example,       Tony Gwynn\u2019s       Cooperstown plaque says that he won \u201ceight batting titles.\u201d Mr. Law says: Yes, Gwynn eight times had the National League\u2019s highest batting average, but so what? In the dead-ball era, when batters rarely walked or hit for power, hits divided by at bats was a satisfactory measure of performance. But batting average leaves walks out of the numerator (just hits) and the denominator (just official at bats). Mr. Law dismisses as Baseball Populism the idea that a hitter\u2019s job is to hit. Actually, he says, the essential offensive skill is to not make outs\u2014to get on base one way or another\u2014and to maximize the number of bases attained from plate appearances. Batting average treats singles and home runs alike, which might be democratic but makes about as much sense as treating $1 and $5 bills as equally valuable.The RBI, an example of what Mr. Law calls baseball\u2019s \u201cEnronian accounting,\u201d is responsible for many unjustified postseason awards: If you lead your league in RBI on a team that makes the playoffs, you are a favorite to be named Most Valuable Player. In 2006, the Phillies\u2019       Ryan Howard       (149 RBI) won the MVP award even though, Mr. Law says, he \u201cwasn\u2019t even the most valuable player on the right side of the Phillies\u2019 infield.\u201d (He implies       Chase Utley       was.)RBI is \u201ccontext-dependent\u201d: It ascribes to an individual an achievement that usually depends on team performance (other players have hit safely or walked ahead of the batter who gets credited with an RBI). In 2001, when       Barry Bonds       hit 73 home runs, he became the only hitter ever to drive himself in more than he drove in teammates (64 times) while amassing enough at bats to qualify for the batting average title. And in 2004, because he was intentionally walked a record 120 times, some mediocre hitters batting behind him had inflated RBI totals. In 1985, the Yankees\u2019       Rickey Henderson,        the best player in the league, reached base 274 times, enabling teammate       Don Mattingly       to drive him in 56 times en route to winning an MVP award that should have gone to Mr. Henderson.Sports statistics can, Mr. Law says, describe or interpret what happened, but pitcher \u201cwins\u201d and \u201closses\u201d do neither. Judging a pitcher\u2019s performance by the number of wins ascribed to him again simply celebrates him for myriad benefits he got from teammates. You can pitch poorly and still be awarded a win\u2014at least 34 times in baseball history, pitchers have \u201cwon\u201d while giving up 10 or more runs. And you can pitch at a historic level and not get a win, as       Warren Spahn       did in 1963 when he pitched 15 innings in a 1-0 loss. The reason it took       Bert Blyleven       unreasonably long to be elected to the Hall of Fame is that voters were mesmerized by wins and losses and so did not properly weigh these facts: He pitched 75 complete games he ended up losing; he made 40 starts in which he lasted at least seven innings and gave up two earned runs or fewer but got the loss; in 35 losses his team lost by one run; in 41 losses his team was shut out.Fielding percentage is, Mr. Law says, \u201cone of the most useless stats baseball has ever seen\u201d because it \u201cdoesn\u2019t impart any useful information whatsoever.\u201d       Ozzie Smith       ranks only 15th among all-time shortstops in fielding percentage (putouts and assists divided by total chances) but is much the most accomplished at creating changes\u2014getting to balls beyond others\u2019 reach and turning them into outs. And how do you measure plays prevented\u2014base runners who did not try to steal on the Cardinals\u2019 catcher       Yadier Molina       or did not try to go from first to third by challenging       Bryce Harper\u2019s       arm in right field?RBI, batting average, pitchers\u2019 wins and fielding percentage merely produce unjust acclaim and undue awards. The pitcher\u2019s \u201csave,\u201d says Mr. Law, is \u201cperhaps the most ridiculous of all of the traditional stats because it has actually changed the way the game is played\u2014unequivocally for the worse.\u201d It has beguiled managers into \u201cmanaging to a stat,\u201d one that didn\u2019t exist during baseball\u2019s first century.Basically, a pitcher gets a save if he enters the game with his team leading by no more than three runs, if he is the final pitcher, and if his team wins. So a relief pitcher who faces nine batters and records nine outs in the sixth, seventh and eighth innings gets nothing for protecting a three-run lead; if the next pitcher surrenders two runs and loads the bases before getting a third out, he is rewarded with a \u201csave.\u201d Good grief.As Mr. Law says, the save statistic tells more about when someone pitches than how he pitches. Seven times relievers have \u201cearned\u201d 30 or more saves while recording dreadful ERAs (earned-run averages) over 5. But the save stat has a cash value in contract negotiations. Worse, managers treat their best relievers as \u201cclosers\u201d (the name is an homage to the save stat) and ask them to get a game\u2019s last outs rather than what might be the most crucial outs\u2014in, say, a bases-loaded situation in an earlier inning.With bigger and bigger pitchers throwing harder than ever to hitters who are stronger than ever, making contact is more difficult, and strikeouts are more frequent. But, then, the game has always been changing: In the 10-9 game seven of the 1960 Pirates-Yankees World Series, the number of strikeouts was: zero. Today data drive the accelerating pace of change as more and more is known about probabilities in situations that can be anticipated or created. The data also measure different expectations in hitter-friendly Coors Field in mile-high Denver or in San Diego\u2019s pitcher-friendly Petco Park.Mr. Law tries to make mincemeat of the idea that there are \u201cclutch hitters\u201d (readers can judge his success for themselves). He has a resounding success demonstrating that in 1941       Ted Williams,        with his gaudy .553 on-base percentage to go with his .406 batting average, deserved the MVP award that was given to the more congenial       Joe DiMaggio       by voters who were mesmerized by DiMaggio\u2019s 56-game hitting streak that year. And the author argues that based on the newly popular measure WAR (wins above replacement value, which Mr. Law explains \u201cisn\u2019t a stat, but a way of putting other stats together\u201d) former Detroit Tigers second baseman       Lou Whitaker       is the best position player not in the Hall of Fame.On page after page, Mr. Law, a Vesuvius of opinions, vindicates       Bruce Catton\u2019s       opinion. Catton, the Civil War historian who died in 1978, said that baseball is the greatest conversation topic America has produced. \u201cConversation\u201d is, however, too bland a word. Baseball fans are contumacious. They will argue about anything, including about who is the best left-handed middle reliever from northeastern South Dakota. Today, however, thanks to the Niagara of data inundating the game, the arguments have become more recondite, illuminating and fun.Mr. Law\u2019s book will increase any fan\u2019s enjoyment of the sport, not least because he refutes something else Catton said. Catton believed that if someone from President       William McKinley\u2019s       era were brought back and seated in one of today\u2019s ballparks, \u201che would see nothing that was not completely familiar.\u201d Not anymore, not if the time traveler were to view the game through the educated eyes of Mr. Law and others like him. They teach us to witness not just familiar actions but innovative decisions that are quite unlike those that baseball people used to make not so very long ago.\u2014Mr. Will, a columnist for the Washington Post, is the author of \u201cMen at Work: The Craft of Baseball\u201d and \u201cA Nice Little Place on the North Side: Wrigley Field at One Hundred.\u201d", "news_time": "2017-06-16 16:46:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-game-you-knew-is-gone-1497645966", "news_title": "The Game You Knew Is Gone", "keywords": "bookcar0617,book review,books,political,general news,arts,entertainment,sports,recreation,routine general news,reviews"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014Rep.

Patrick McHenry (R, N.C.), with whom he works closely, is expected to help pick up any slack, House GOP aides and lawmakers said. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.), who previously was the majority whip, is also expected to work with Mr. Scalise\u2019s staff during the recovery.Also wounded in the shooting were Zack Barth, a staff member of Rep. Roger Williams (R., Texas), and Matt Mika, a lobbyist for             Tyson Foods Inc.       and former congressional aide.Mr. Barth was released from the hospital\u00a0on Wednesday\u00a0afternoon, Mr. Williams said.

At that moment, the age of the attack submarine was born, and the struggle for naval supremacy for a great part of both World War I and World War II was defined. The U-boat\u2014shorthand for \u201cUnterseeboot\u201d\u2014had come of age.It is appropriate, then, that the historian Lawrence Goldstone begins \u201cGoing Deep\u201d with a dramatic re-telling of the U-9\u2019s exploit. It should be said immediately that his chronicle doesn\u2019t present the whole history of submarine warfare but rather the story of the efforts of various American inventors and entrepreneurs\u2014above all, an Irish-born engineer named       John Philip Holland      \u2014to create a power-driven, human-directed and sub-marine vessel that could stalk and then, with its torpedoes, obliterate even the most powerful of surface warships. In the formative years of its development\u2014from the Civil War to World War I\u2014the story is chiefly an American one, though not completely, which is perhaps, despite the book\u2019s many merits, a partial weakness of Mr. Goldstone\u2019s presentation.By Lawrence GoldstonePegasus, 377 pages, $27.95The librarian shelving \u201cGoing Deep\u201d might pause before finding its exact location. It does indeed concern itself with technological innovation\u2014and there are some intriguing illustrations to help the reader along: One of them, for instance, shows an electric taxi moving through New York streets in 1899, one of the many enterprises of       Isaac Rice,        whose interest in batteries and electrical systems would feed into his submarine research. The book also includes a large amount of detail about the U.S. Navy\u2019s budgetary and ship-construction concerns as it entered the modern, post-Civil War decades. But \u201cGoing Deep\u201d can also be seen, plausibly, as a study in American business history. As such, it fits in line with Mr. Goldstone\u2019s earlier studies, notably \u201cBirdmen: The Wright Brothers,       Glenn Curtiss,        and the Battle to Control the Skies\u201d (2014) and \u201cDrive!       Henry Ford,       George Selden,        and the Race to Invent the Auto Age\u201d (2016). The publisher\u2019s blurb calls these works, appropriately, \u201cinnovation histories.\u201dMore specifically, \u201cGoing Deep\u201d is a story of late-19th-century American competitive capitalism, of winners and losers in the struggle to win congressional support and Navy Department authorizations for another fabulous and disruptive\u2014and, if one got it right, hugely profitable\u2014new technology. To the winner in this race went all, or nearly all, the spoils. Unlike the automobile, where the consumer would decide the outcome, but just like early aircraft development, the submarine depended upon government contracts, domestic and foreign. Thus Mr. Goldstone\u2019s narrative also sheds light on America\u2019s early military-industrial complex, which often involved dubious if not outright illegal actions, bribery, political corruption, exaggerated \u201cyellow press\u201d claims and bankrupted enterprises.The book is strongest in its detail of technological invention, as Holland and the other designers struggled to overcome the many challenges of early submarine development. How do you design fan vanes\u2014the movable fins or \u201cwings\u201d on the boat\u2019s side\u2014so that they will allow you to control oblique diving and also ensure that the craft will rise back to the surface? How do you keep the vessel stable when the center of gravity can shift so easily, not least when a torpedo is fired? How do you release the fatal battery and engine fumes from a self-contained cylinder (for that\u2019s what a submarine is) 60 feet under the surface? Finding the answers to these questions and others involved sea trials and, along the way, the loss of many brave men.Mr. Goldstone has a shrewd eye and a lively pen. He wryly labels some supposed naval experts overseeing the production of an early design \u201cnotably inexpert\u201d and \u201cmore inflexible for their ignorance.\u201d While he doesn\u2019t, curiously, employ the vast unpublished archives of the U.S. Navy (now in the National Archives), he makes ready use of memoir literature and quotes from the contemporary American press, which had an enormous appetite for any sign that Holland and his designer rivals were producing a Jules Verne-like wonder-weapon of the deep.Among many fine vignettes is the story of       Teddy Roosevelt\u2019s       prescient interest in the submarine, including his taking an underwater trip in a prototype across Long Island Sound in August 1905. At this, as may be imagined, the newspapers went wild.\u201cGoing Deep\u201d ends in 1914. By that time, the U.S. Navy was on its way to possessing some submarines\u2014vessels equipped with torpedoes that were therefore capable, in theory, of sinking an enemy\u2019s warships or his merchant marine, although in fact these boats were aimed at only coastal defense. And by 1914 American industry could boast of a nascent submarine-building capacity, especially in the form of the Electric Boat Co., which was to survive the capriciousness of the Navy Department\u2019s \u201con-off\u201d love affair with the submarine until World War II finally proved its undoubted power.But these successes, limited though they were, were not John Philip Holland\u2019s. He had played a major role\u2014really, the greatest role\u2014in developing the early submarine, grasping that it could transform naval warfare. He had grappled with and overcome most of the daunting technological obstacles in the way of making his vision a reality. Mr. Goldstone is surely right to give him such prominence. But eventually Holland was shunted aside by more ruthless entrepreneurs, diddled by business partners and denied Navy contracts. He passed away on Aug. 12, 1914, just as World War I was beginning. By then, feeling beaten and having retired, he was a quiet churchman and amateur historian. This part of Mr. Goldstone\u2019s story is not a happy one.For a book that is about the advent of the attack submarine, \u201cGoing Deep\u201d is too America-centric in both its story and sources. In the decades before 1914, inventing submarines was, like inventing aircraft, something that involved a frenzied international competition, and on many occasions American designs were not the best. One yearns here for a comparative look, as       Katherine Epstein       offered in \u201cTorpedo: Inventing the Military-Industrial Complex in the United States and Great Britain\u201d (2014).And since Mr. Goldstone\u2019s story opens with the stunning wartime success of the U-9, one yearns more for even a brief explanation of why the most formidable submarine navy in both world wars was Germany\u2019s, not America\u2019s. Even the best of the nationally focused \u201cinnovation histories,\u201d and this is one of them, would look better if they gave the reader an international perspective.\u2014Mr. Kennedy, a professor of history at Yale University, is the author of \u201cThe Rise and Fall of the Great Powers.\u201d He is currently writing a book on sea power and World War II.", "news_time": "2017-06-16 16:18:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-man-down-below-1497644304", "news_title": "A Man Down Below", "keywords": "bookcar0617,book review,books,political,general news,national,public security,armed forces,arts,entertainment,reviews"}, {"content": "Alexandre and Victor Ripp were ordinary Jewish boys from Russian families, similar in age and physical appearance, living in Paris in the early 1940s. But any further resemblances between the two cousins can never be known: In July 1942, at the age of three, Alexandre was rounded up with his grandmother and soon after was murdered at Auschwitz. By then, Victor and his family had managed a narrow escape from France, leaving just weeks after Germany\u2019s invasion in the spring of 1940.Why was it Victor\u2014now living in suburban New Jersey\u2014who survived and not Alexandre?That\u2019s the unbearable question that has always haunted Mr. Ripp. It gnawed with particular ferocity after he attended an exhibit several years ago at Berlin\u2019s Jewish Museum that included material about his mother\u2019s well-to-do family, which possessed the combination of foresight, financial assets and connections to uproot themselves after Hitler\u2019s rise to power. Ultimately, every member of the Kahan family\u2014more than 30 people\u2014found their way to safety. Many went to Palestine; others decamped for France before being forced to seek refuge yet again, in time landing in America. Their journey was fraught. But they lived.By contrast, the vast majority of Mr. Ripp\u2019s father\u2019s family, including 10 others besides Alexandre, were rounded up, shipped off in cattle cars and exterminated. Rather than being commemorated in a museum exhibit as the Kahans were, they don\u2019t even have graves.By Victor RippFarrar, Straus & Giroux, 206 pages, $25For Mr. Ripp, this stark disparity stung\u2014and generated ruminations about the nature of remembrance, the role of public memorials and, ultimately, an itinerary that would take him to 35 different Holocaust memorials in Germany, France, Poland, Belarus, Austria and Hungary. At least some of these, he hoped, \u201cwould also spark to life the story about the different destinies of the Kahans and the Ripps.\u201dIn \u201cHell\u2019s Traces: One Murder, Two Families, Thirty-Five Holocaust Memorials\u201d Mr. Ripp intersperses his journeys to these memorials with the stories and fates of the two sides of his family. He also does a good deal of reporting, talking to architects, designers, Jewish community leaders, local guides and European friends about the way these memorials honor\u2014or in some cases, deny\u2014the Holocaust.The author finds that the most effective memorials are not necessarily the most celebrated ones. For instance, he has reservations about Germany\u2019s Stolpersteine, or stumbling stones. These cobblestone-sized memorials are embedded in the pavement outside the last known residences of Hitler\u2019s victims and inscribed with their names and dates of birth and death. But Mr. Ripp doesn\u2019t like the notion of stumbling over a life: \u201cI like memorials to be set off by fences or announced by signs or otherwise conspicuously marked,\u201d he writes.One of the most stirring memorials Mr. Ripp visits is situated in the Berlin neighborhood that was once called Jewish Switzerland because of the preponderance of Jews who lived there, including Albert Einstein and Erich Fromm. Mounted on 80 lamp posts over several blocks are two-sided plaques that tell the step-by-step story of the laws passed to marginalize, persecute and, ultimately, annihilate the Jews. One side of each plaque shows a pictogram (swim trunks, for instance), with the other side displaying the text of the Nazi-era law banning Jews from yet another ordinary activity (in this case, the dictate that Jews could no longer use Berlin pools). As the memorial\u2019s designers Renata Stih and Frieder Schnock explain to the author, the point was to \u201cmake visible the conditions which led in an insidiously logical way to the destruction of the Jewish inhabitants.\u201d Thus the succession of plaques ends with a pictogram of a char-blackened face, redolent of the death camps and their crematoriums. To some this may sound tasteless, but the impact was striking. \u201cWhen we first put up the signs, some people took them to be new government rules,\u201d Ms. Stih recounted. \u201cApparently these people believed that it was perfectly reasonable for Nazi policies to be put back into practice. Finally we had to attach a small disk to each sign to tell people that they were looking at art.\u201dIn Grodno, the birthplace of the author\u2019s father and Alexandre\u2019s father, Mr. Ripp finds what he calls an \u201canti-Holocaust memorial\u201d: a sports stadium built, in 1950, on the grounds of Grodno\u2019s old Jewish cemetery. It wasn\u2019t until 2003, when human remains were uprooted during stadium repairs, that an easy-to-miss plaque went up, reading: \u201cIn memory of those Jews who from the XIV century lived on the land of Grodno.\u201d That\u2019s all it says. There is no reference to the Holocaust, the more than 44,000 Grodno Jews who were thrown into extermination camps, or the cemetery. To Mr. Ripp, the vague wording \u201cseemed . . . only to repeat the willed ignorance it should have been apologizing for.\u201dSuch moments are chilling, but as the book goes on, Mr. Ripp\u2019s mission begins to seem tedious, perhaps even to himself. For instance, despite being annoyed by the prevalence of stumble stones, he also complains when not enough visitors are present or pay attention at particular memorials. \u201cIf no one notices a Holocaust memorial, does it still have significance?\u201d An excellent question, to be sure, but Mr. Ripp seems unhappy either way.Eventually he finds the resonance he has sought all along, in a memorial set in a Parisian playground in the neighborhood where Alexandre once lived. A glass tablet features an etching of two hands reaching for each other with the inscription, in Mr. Ripp\u2019s translation: \u201cNumbered among those who lived in Paris in the Sixteenth Arrondissement, there were fifteen so young that they had not reached an age when they would have attended school. As you pass by, read their names, your memory is their only grave.\u201d Among those names is Alexandre\u2019s. Here, at last, Mr. Ripp can finally glimpse the boy Alexandre was\u2014and conjure the grown man he never had the chance to become. With this act of memory and imagination, Mr. Ripp transforms his cousin from a ghostly memory to a vivid presence whose loss he\u2014and his readers\u2014can more fully grasp.\u2014Ms. Cole is the author of the memoir \u201cAfter Great Pain: A New Life Emerges.\u201d", "news_time": "2017-06-16 16:12:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/reminders-to-never-forget-1497643952", "news_title": "Reminders to Never Forget", "keywords": "books,political,general news,arts,entertainment,reviews"}, {"content": "It is clearance season in the stock market\u2019s grocery aisle.The weekend couldn\u2019t possibly arrive soon enough for owners of             Kroger        KR 1.73%       stock.

Since the start of the 2008 financial crisis, the world\u2019s central bankers have materialized the equivalent of $12.25 trillion. Just tap, tap, tap on a computer keypad.\u201cOne Nation Under Gold\u201d is a brief against the kind of money you have to dig out of the ground. And you do have to dig. The value of all the gold that\u2019s ever been mined (and which mostly still exists in the form of baubles, coins and ingots), according to the World Gold Council, is a mere $7.4 trillion.Gold anchored the various metallic monetary systems that existed from the 18th century to 1971. They were imperfect, all right, just as       James Ledbetter       bends over backward to demonstrate. The question is whether the gold standard was any more imperfect than the system in place today.By James LedbetterLiveright, 380 pages, $28.95That system features monetary oversight by former university economics faculty\u2014the Ph.D. standard, let\u2019s call it. The ex-professors buy bonds with money they whistle into existence (\u201cquantitative easing\u201d), tinker with interest rates, and give speeches about their intentions to buy bonds and tinker with interest rates (\u201cforward guidance\u201d).You wonder how the Ph.D. standard came to eclipse a system whose very name, \u201cgold standard,\u201d is a byword for excellence. Addressing a national television audience on Sunday evening, Aug. 15, 1971, President       Richard Nixon       announced the temporary suspension of the dollar\u2019s convertibility into gold. No more would foreign governments enjoy the right to trade in their greenbacks for bullion at the then standard rate of $35 to the ounce. (Americans had long since relinquished that right; indeed, as Nixon spoke, they could not legally own gold.) Roughly a half-century later, the temporary suspension is beginning to look permanent.Up until the Nixon edict, paper money, under the law, was a kind of derivative. It derived its value from the metal into which it was convertible. Today\u2019s dollar is inconvertible. To be sure, you can exchange Federal Reserve notes for gold coins or bitcoins to your heart\u2019s desire, but the rate of exchange is whatever the market will bear. Under a gold standard, fixedness was the great monetary virtue. Nowadays, adaptability is the beau ideal. As       George Gilder       observes, money has been transformed from a measuring rod into a magic wand. Anyway, the Hamiltons or Lincolns or Grants in your wallet owe their value to the government\u2019s fiat, not to its gold.Mr. Ledbetter\u2019s book is a chronicle of the American people\u2019s fascination with gold. He is mystified and bemused by it. He rolls his eyes at the gold rushes and the gold-centered orthodoxies of yesteryear. Whatever were our forebears thinking?His well-spun narrative spans the better part of four centuries. He takes us from gold mining in North Carolina during the administration of John Adams to the Founders\u2019 monetary protocols, which defined the dollar as a weight of gold or silver; from the California Gold Rush to the late-19th-century politics of inflation, featuring William Jennings Bryan and his unsuccessful campaign to inflate the gold dollar by substituting abundant silver; from the formation of the Federal Reserve in 1913\u2014the dollar was still as good as gold\u2014to the shockingly improvisational dollar policies of the New Deal. One fine day, Mr. Ledbetter relates,       FDR       raised the gold price by 21 cents because it seemed to the president that three times seven was a lucky number.Next comes the patchwork gold regime of the 1950s and 1960s, the system known by the place at which it was conceived, Bretton Woods (N.H.). No more was gold the gyroscope, or flywheel, of the international monetary system, as       Lewis E. Lehrman       has written. Now the metal sat inert in vaults. Central banks might demand the right to convert their dollars into gold, and vice versa, but few exercised the option.Mr. Ledbetter breaks some historical news by uncovering the existence of Operation Goldfinger, a secret government project in the time of       Lyndon Johnson       to extract gold from \u201cseawater, meteorites, even plants.\u201d By the late 1960s, America\u2019s foreign liabilities were growing much faster than the gold available to satisfy them. For better or worse, the run on finite American gold continued, and Nixon cut the cord.On, now, to the great inflation of the 1970s, along with the rise of the goldbugs, the cranks (Mr. Ledbetter\u2019s interpretation) or visionaries (as others might style them) who predicted the collapse of the dollar and the rise of double-digit inflation in the       Jimmy Carter       years. In the mid-1970s, as Mr. Ledbetter recounts, the long fight to restore the right of American citizens to own gold\u2014a right that FDR\u2019s administration had extinguished in 1933\u2014was finally won. The author concludes his story with a survey of the contemporary rear-guard movement to expose the failings of today\u2019s monetary nostrums and reinstitute a gold dollar.As if to clinch the case against gold\u2014and, necessarily, the case for the modern-day status quo\u2014Mr. Ledbetter writes: \u201cOf forty economists teaching at America\u2019s most prestigious universities\u2014including many who\u2019ve advised or worked in Republican administrations\u2014exactly zero responded favorably to a gold-standard question asked in 2012.\u201d Perhaps so, but \u201czero\u201d or thereabouts likewise describes the number of established economists who in 2005, \u201906 and \u201907 anticipated the coming of the biggest financial event of their professional lives. The economists mean no harm. But if, in unison, they arrive at the conclusion that tomorrow is Monday, a prudent person would check the calendar.Mr. Ledbetter makes a great deal of today\u2019s gold-standard advocates, more, I think, than those lonely idealists would claim for themselves (or ourselves, as I am one of them). The price of gold peaked as long ago as 2011 (at $1,900, versus $1,250 today), while so-called crypto-currencies like bitcoin have emerged as the favorite alternative to government-issued money. It\u2019s not so obvious that, as Mr. Ledbetter puts it, \u201cwe cannot get enough of the metal.\u201d On the contrary, to judge by ultra-low interest rates and sky-high stock prices, we cannot\u2014for now\u2014get enough of our celebrity central bankers.What was the gold standard, exactly\u2014this thing that the professors dismiss so airily today? A self-respecting member of the community of gold-standard nations defined its money as a weight of bullion. It allowed gold to enter and leave the country freely. It exchanged bank notes to gold, and vice versa, at a fixed and inviolable rate. The people, not the authorities, decided which form of money was best.The gold standard was a hard task master, all right. You couldn\u2019t devalue your way out of trouble. You couldn\u2019t run up a big domestic budget deficit. The central bank of a gold-standard country (if there was a central bank) was charged with preserving the convertibility of the currency and, in a pinch, serving as lender of last resort to needy commercial banks. Growth, employment and price stability took their own course. And if, in a financial panic or a business-cycle downturn, gold fled the country, it was the duty of the central bank to establish a rate of interest that called the metal home. In the throes of a crisis, interest rates would likely go up, not down.The modern sensibility quakes at the rigor of such a system. Our forebears embraced it. Countries observed the gold standard because it was progressive, effective, civilized. It anchored prices over the long term (with many a bump in the short term). It promoted balance in international accounts and discipline in domestic ones. Great thinkers\u2014      Adam Smith,       David Ricardo       and, yes,       John Maynard Keynes       himself in the wake of World War I\u2014extolled it.The chronic problem in gold-standard days was the one that continues to bedevil us moderns: how to maintain a stable currency when lenders and borrowers run amok. President       James Buchanan,        Lincoln\u2019s immediate predecessor, addressed the question in his first State of the Union address in the wake of the Panic of 1857. The story of American finance, he contended, was the story of paper credit subverting sound money: \u201cAt successive intervals the best and most enterprising men have been tempted to their ruin by excessive bank loans of mere paper credit.\u201d A not-so-distinguished president, Buchanan made the monetary point that Mr. Ledbetter skirts: Excessive lending and borrowing subverts the stability of money. It\u2019s the cause of panics under monetary systems both metallic and paper. Which is to say that we earthlings will never achieve financial perfection. It seems that the trouble (or, at least, one trouble) with money is credit and that the trouble with credit is people.The gold standard, perhaps above all, was a political institution. It flourished in the age of classical liberalism. It was the financial counterpart to the philosophy of limited government. The Ph.D. standard is likewise a political institution. It is the financial counterpart to the philosophy of statism. The policy that some banks are too big to fail\u2014that they must be treated almost as wards of the state to prevent their failure\u2014is a hallmark of the modern age. The policy\u2014indeed, the law\u2014that the stockholders of a bank are themselves responsible for the solvency of the institution in which they hold a fractional interest was a hallmark of the gold-standard era.Mr. Ledbetter is on a mission to set the historical record straight and head off an unprogressive movement away from paper money. He writes: \u201cTo avoid gold\u2019s false paths, we need to argue with the past, to test the assumptions that are too often and too casually passed uncritically.\u201dI expect that before very long we will be arguing with our immediate past\u2014demanding to know why the public debt has doubled since 2007, second-guessing our collective belief in the mazy doctrines of \u201cquantitative easing\u201d and \u201cforward guidance,\u201d and tuning in to watch congressional hearings into the causes of some future stock-market crash. Mr. Ledbetter has told some good stories. He hasn\u2019t made his case.\u2014Mr. Grant is the editor of Grant\u2019s Interest Rate Observer.", "news_time": "2017-06-16 16:09:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/goodbye-yellow-brick-road-1497643771", "news_title": "Goodbye, Yellow Brick Road", "keywords": "bookcar0617,book review,monetary policy,economic news,books,political,general news,arts,entertainment,reviews"}, {"content": "The U.S. government bond market ended an eventful week on a quiet note Friday, with yields holding roughly flat after declining earlier in week in response to soft inflation data.The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note settled at 2.157%, compared with 2.160% Thursday and 2.201% the previous Friday.Yields fall when bond prices rise.After drifting slightly higher overnight, yields snapped back Friday morning after new data showed an unexpected decline in housing starts. Overall, it was a fairly uneventful session, a possible sign of things to come given a lack of major economic data for the next couple of weeks.Many investors and analysts now say that the direction for Treasury yields will be largely dictated by inflation data. In light of recent reports, many investors doubt the Federal Reserve will be able to follow through on its plan of raising interest-rates at least once more this year. Further signs that inflation is stuck below the Fed\u2019s 2% target would bolster this skepticism, leading to lower Treasury yields, while stronger data would have the opposite effect, investors and analysts say.Over the past week, the bond market staged a major rally in response to the latest lackluster inflation reading. An announcement from the Fed that it was raising short-term interest-rates and sticking with its tightening plan for the rest of the year only led to a partial retracement of the initial move.Ultimately, inflation data is \u201cthe only real catalyst\u201d that could substantially alter the market, said Scott Kimball, portfolio manager of BMO TCH Core Plus Bond Fund.While Fed officials have argued that the recent downturn was likely caused by temporary factors, \u201cthe market is viewing it as more of a challenge,\u201d he said.One gauge of inflation expectations, the 10-year break-even rate, which measures the yield premium on the 10-year Treasury note relative to the 10-year Treasury inflation-protected security, has dropped in recent weeks. On Friday, it implied investors expect an annual inflation rate of 1.676% over the next 10 years, down from 1.819% on May 31, according to Tradeweb.In addition to influencing monetary policy, inflation poses a direct threat to government bonds by chipping away their fixed returns over time.

The funds, which the firm is calling ADRPLUS, would also invest in derivatives contracts designed to minimize the impact of the exchange-rate fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the local currency of the foreign security.ADRs offer U.S. investors exposure to foreign stocks, but also expose them to the fluctuations in the security\u2019s local currency. A U.S. investor who buys a Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. ADR, for example, may lose money even if the stock price doesn\u2019t fluctuate but the yen declines versus the dollar.Precidian filed for an ADRPLUS fund structure in 2014, but never launched any funds by that name. The latest regulatory filing doesn\u2019t disclose which exchange the funds would trade on or divulge any fee information. It is still possible the SEC could reject the latest application or request changes.The planned ETFs would offer access to ADRs of 19 companies including AstraZeneca PLC, HSBC Holdings PLC and Royal Dutch Shell PLC. They would be structured as grantor trusts in order to qualify as an investment fund under the Investment Company Act of 1940, which says a fund must offer a degree of diversity in its investments, which these funds would lack. (SPDR Gold Shares, which invests only in gold bullion bars, is an example of a grantor trust.)The current filing shows \u201can enormously clever use of the structure,\u201d says       David Nadig,        chief executive of ETF.com.\u201cThey\u2019re very unique and single purpose; they\u2019re really pretty plain vanilla ETFs,\u201d which are likely to be used by a fairly narrow set of investors\u2014stock pickers who aren\u2019t managing such an enormous portfolio that they can afford to manage a currency book against it, Mr. Nadig says. \u201cThere\u2019s a convenience factor here which might appeal to hedge funds or those managing on a short-term basis\u201d like day traders, he says.But       Ben Johnson,        director of global ETF research at Morningstar Inc., called the proposed funds \u201ca solution in search of a problem.\u201d\u201cIn practice, people are moving away from picking individual stocks,\u201d Mr. Johnson says. \u201cI just don\u2019t think there\u2019s a market for it.

Brent crude, the global benchmark, gained 45 cents, or 1%, to $47.37 a barrel on ICE Futures Europe.That wasn\u2019t enough to overcome large losses from earlier this week, leaving U.S. prices down 2.4% and global prices down 1.6% over the last five sessions. Both are no on fourth-week losing streaks, the longest for U.S. oil since December 2015 and for global oil since November.Prices got \u201cminimal support\u201d Friday morning from a slightly weaker dollar and higher investor risk sentiment, according to       Giovanni Staunovo,        a commodity analyst at UBS. Bargain buyers probably also helped, as did traders who successfully bet on falling prices then closing out trades ahead of the weekend, analysts said.\u201cPeople come in and buy because they think that\u2019s a pretty low price,\u201d with U.S. oil near $44 a barrel, said Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates in Houston. \u201cBut in the physical market we\u2019re seeing more ominous signs.\u201dOil fell more than 5% in each of the past two weeks, and hit seven-month lows earlier this week. U.S. companies are drilling and producing more, and the weekly rig count from Baker Hughes Inc. reported an increase for the 22nd-straight week.That has hampered efforts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to get global inventories back to their five-year average. Production cuts, which started in January, haven\u2019t yet had much success on that front, resulting in the output caps being extended until March. But some analysts have said that even then, supplies may still be above OPEC\u2019s goal.\u201cI don\u2019t think we can talk about a serious recovery,\u201d said       Eugen Weinberg,        head of commodity research at             Commerzbank.       \u201cThere is a risk of low prices going forward\u201d because of continued oversupply and an increase in U.S. production, he added.Mr. Weinberg said the \u201cslight recovery\u201d Friday morning was largely aided by speculative buying on the heels of the \u201cmessy prices fall\u201d on Wednesday. Both Brent and West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. price setter, fell almost 4% Wednesday to their lowest levels of 2017.\u201cIt is no shoo-in that oil\u2019s losing streak is coming to a halt. While the demand outlook is on track for a much-needed boost over the coming months, pervasive doubts over the oil market rebalancing will linger without confirmation that the supply overhang is waning,\u201d according to a note released Friday morning by PVM.Earlier this week, the International Energy Agency offered a grim forecast that a gusher of new supplies from the U.S. stands to keep the market well-flushed for some time.The U.S. Energy Department echoed that sentiment on Thursday, saying that some inventory declines through summer may nudge prices higher the next few months, possibly resulting in even-higher domestic output in 2018 than currently anticipated.This year\u2019s rebound in U.S. oil production and a 17% drop in prices have drawn harsh criticisms about OPEC\u2019s wisdom in implementing the output cuts. \u201cBy setting impossible objects, by promising unreachable targets, OPEC ministers only managed to further motivate U.S. producers,\u201d said       Mohab Kamel,        a trader at Geneva-based Magma Oil.Stronger-than-expected production rebounds in Nigeria and Libya, two OPEC nations exempt from cutting their output, have also kept global supplies flush.

It was also signed by four Democrats: Steve Bullock of Montana, John Hickenlooper of Colorado,       John Bel Edwards       of Louisiana and       Tom Wolf       of Pennsylvania.The letters says the House legislation fails to improve coverage for millions of Americans.\u201cIt calls into question coverage for the vulnerable and fails to provide the necessary resources to ensure that no one is left out, while shifting significant costs to the states,\u201d according to the letter.The letter comes as Senate Republicans are drafting their own version of health overhaul legislation that would roll back parts of the Affordable Care Act and cut federal Medicaid funding to the states.The governors\u2019 exhortation to replace the GOP effort with a bipartisan approach is likely to intensify the pressure on centrist Senate Republicans who are already uneasy over plans to curb the open-ended federal funding of Medicaid and to phase out the program\u2019s expansion under the ACA.Mr. Sandoval\u2019s signature on the letter in particular puts Nevada GOP Sen. Dean Heller, who is up for re-election next year, in a difficult position, caught between his governor\u2019s concerns over the congressional approach and Senate GOP leaders\u2019 desire to wrestle a bill through the chamber.The House plan would bring deep cuts to Medicaid by changing the way the state-federal program for the low-income and disabled is funded. It would also in 2020 phase out enhanced federal funding for new enrollees in the 31 states that expanded the program.\u201cWhile their letter is focused on the House bill, we certainly appreciate their views as we continue to develop a proposal to rescue the millions of Americans trapped by Obamacare,\u201d said Antonia Ferrier, a spokeswoman for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.).Senate Republicans have been working for weeks to reach consensus on how to alter the bill passed by the House last month, with little public progress. Mr. McConnell, who presides over a 52-48 majority, can lose no more than two votes, and conservatives are already showing signs of unease with the bill\u2019s direction.The governors\u2019 letter could give GOP senators from their states, such as Rob Portman of Ohio and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, more grounds to balk at the final bill.The letter also suggests that the current contours of the Senate bill are raising alarms in the home states of key senators. Senate Republicans already were expected to ease the impact of the House bill by more gradually phasing out of federal funding to the 31 states that expanded Medicaid under the ACA.The Senate health plan may include funding to insurers that helps them offset the assistance they provide to help low-income consumers with high out-of-pocket costs. Insurers have said they would raise premiums, and some have said they may leave the ACA\u2019s exchanges, if they lose the billions of dollars in subsidy payments.Meanwhile, a growing number of major insurers are seeking premium increases averaging 20% or more on plans sold under the ACA. Republicans say this shows the fundamental problems of the ACA, sometimes called Obamacare, while Democrats blame the price rises on the uncertainty created by the GOP struggles to write a health plan.Many of the Republican Senators from states that expanded Medicaid represent states that also helped elect President       Donald Trump.       Some GOP senators, including Sen.       Shelley Moore Capito       (R., W.V.), have already said they are concerned about an adequate transition time for people moving off Medicaid.But Republican leaders are highly critical of the ACA, which they say has reduced choice and increased premiums, and are pushing their bill forward. The House passed its legislation last month and Senate Republicans hope to vote on a bill before their August recess.Mr. Trump has met with Republican governors who are concerned about the Medicaid cuts because state governments generally oversee the program. Some governors, including Mr. Sandoval, have repeatedly said they want to be sure people who have coverage won\u2019t lose it.Messrs. Kasich and Sandoval in March joined a letter signed by two other Republican governors,       Rick Snyder       of Michigan and       Asa Hutchinson       of Arkansas, in opposition to the House GOP legislation.The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that the House bill would cut federal spending on Medicaid by $880 billion over 10 years. Between that and other changes, the CBO estimates that 24 million fewer Americans would have health coverage in 2026 compared with the current law.Write to Stephanie Armour at stephanie.armour@wsj.com and Kristina Peterson at kristina.peterson@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-16 15:40:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/gop-governors-criticize-house-health-care-bill-1497632471", "news_title": "Bipartisan Group of Governors Criticizes GOP Health Bill\u2019s Medicaid Cuts", "keywords": "affordable care act,health care overhaul,health care reform,house republicans,john kasich,obamacare,political,general news,health,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,lower house,upper house,insurance,non-life insurance,medical insurance,financial services,government sponsored health insurance,medicaid"}, {"content": "ERIN, Wis.\u2014The U.S. Open has a way of exposing golf for what it really is: an elaborate exercise in self-torment. Players trudge and players grumble and after four days, the least miserable of them all stands on the 18th green and hoists a trophy. But in the early rounds at Erin Hills this week, players expressed a sentiment new to this event. They strolled the course, a first-time U.S. Open host, and found it surprisingly delightful.\u201cVery, very fair,\u201d said Brandt Snedeker.\u201cReally fun,\u201d said Paul Casey. \u201cI don\u2019t know that I\u2019ve ever played a U.S. Open where I\u2019ve had that much enjoyment.\u201dThis was not exactly music to the ears of the USGA, which prides itself on making this event the toughest test in golf. The question going into the weekend is how much more capable the course is of defending itself against the onslaught of birdies\u2014and how much tournament officials can do to help.Someone will win the U.S. Open, though whether it more closely resembles the Phoenix Open remains to be seen. Rory McIlroy holds the record for lowest winning score to par, at 16 under in 2011, and he and       Tiger Woods       (12 under in 2000) are the only players to finish double digits under par. Rickie Fowler and Brooks Koepka each got to 9 under after 27 holes Friday afternoon, two strokes ahead of Casey.Set up at 7,845 yards on Thursday\u2014it was six yards shorter on Friday\u2014Erin Hills is the longest course in major championship history. Not included in that figure a the unusually long, hilly walks between each hole. It is a formidable test of distance and stamina, and for the average weekend player, probably a daunting one.But for a generation of pro golfers distinct primarily in their devotion to physical fitness and their booming drives, the terrain of Erin Hills is not as brutal as it seems. With four par 5s\u2014it\u2019s the first par-72 U.S. Open since 1992\u2014the length actually gives players more birdie chances.\u201cIt\u2019s longer on the scorecard than most courses,\u201d said USGA executive director Mike Davis. \u201cBut when you give the players an extra two par 5s per round, they\u2019re going score better.\u201dSo where was the USGA hoping the misery would come from? In part, the weather.Strong winds are common at Erin Hills, which has few trees. If the wind is howling and the turf is hard and fast, it is a different course. The combination of the two makes balls more likely to find two of the features that give Erin Hills its teeth: tall fescue grasses that line the fairways and bunkers.But the course was softened by heavy rain earlier in the week, and the winds have been mostly benign so far. They were not forecast to reach 20 mph until Sunday and there is a chance of more rain Saturday.The course also offers an array of setup options, in terms of both tee boxes and hole locations.\u201cThe defense of this golf course is hole locations,\u201d Jordan Spieth said.After the first round saw a tournament-record 44 scores under par, the USGA tucked many pins closer to the edges of the greens in the second round. Scores were creeping up slightly early Friday, though if 29 or more players finish below par Sunday, it would set a tournament record.For players who are wild off the tee, Erin Hills is penal enough on its own. Dustin Johnson, the world No. 1, spent what must have felt like hours wading through knee-high fescue while stumbling to a first-round 75. A low point came on the 17th hole, when he hit his second shot out of the left fescue and into more fescue ahead. The ball ricocheted off a man in the gallery who got his name wrong, telling the defending champion from a few feet away, \u201cYou got a nice bounce off my arm, Justin.\u201dBut for players who are just a little bit off, the penalties have been far less severe than they are accustomed to. Snedeker said he almost felt guilty about the fact that he was able to make birdie on the eighth hole Thursday after hitting his tee shot into the rough.\u201cThis is never going to happen again,\u201d he said. \u201cI might as well enjoy it.\u201d", "news_time": "2017-06-16 15:31:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/isnt-this-the-u-s-open-why-all-the-smiles-1497641487", "news_title": "Isn\u2019t This the U.S. Open?

Sad!,\u201d tweeted President       Donald Trump       this morning. Mr. Trump isn\u2019t known for understatement, but in this case his argument is stronger than he suggests, because then-Director       Jim Comey\u2019s       FBI began looking for evidence of collusion nearly a full year ago. It still hasn\u2019t appeared, which means that Department of Justice Special Counsel Robert Mueller is conducting an investigation in search of a premise. But if this is starting to look like the Seinfeld of federal productions\u2014a show about nothing\u2014recent events suggest it could end up being about something worse.Mr. Mueller has a sterling reputation and a long record of service to the United States, including as a decorated Marine in Vietnam and as Mr. Comey\u2019s predecessor atop the FBI. He is known for his independence and professionalism, which makes recent media reports about his burgeoning investigation rather puzzling.CNN reports today that Mr. Mueller has already hired 13 lawyers and plans to hire more. The network describes the investigative team:If Mr. Mueller promptly exonerates the President, the presence of partisan Democrats on the investigative team will certainly lend credibility to Mr. Mueller\u2019s findings. In a similar way, the presence of Trump donors on the team would bolster Mr. Mueller\u2019s case if he ended up claiming that the President did something wrong.Conscientious people\u2014and even attorneys\u2014can put their politics aside and perform honest service. But rather than deciding which political partisans to engage in this work, shouldn\u2019t Mr. Mueller be seeking people who don\u2019t have a particular rooting interest in the outcome? For both the appearance and the reality of a fair inquiry, an independent staff would seem to be an obvious objective when assembling the team.Is it hard to find good lawyers who aren\u2019t political activists? Mr. Mueller is obviously comfortable hiring former WilmerHale colleagues, and it turns out it\u2019s not so easy finding attorneys there who aren\u2019t partisans. The firm\u2019s investigative and criminal litigation practice group is one obvious place to look for lawyers to join the Russia investigation. Both co-chairs of this group at WilmerHale are Democratic donors, according to OpenSecrets.org. This group is part of a larger \u201cLitigation/Controversy Department,\u201d  and its chair and all four vice chairs are also Democratic check-writers, though a couple of them have also contributed to Republicans. Many of the more junior attorneys are also active in politics, which means Mr. Mueller may need to get outside his comfort zone if he wants more independent thinkers.Again, just because Mr. Mueller hired people who gave hefty donations to Democrats doesn\u2019t mean these lawyers can\u2019t do a professional job searching for the long-sought evidence of collusion. But then what are we to make of the Washington Post report this week with various anonymous sources saying Mr. Mueller\u2019s team is investigating if the President obstructed justice\u2014and then another Post report based on leaks saying Team Mueller is looking into presidential son-in-law       Jared Kushner\u2019s       business dealings?As for the idea that Mr. Trump might have obstructed justice, Andy McCarthy and Alan Dershowitz and Michael McConnell have separately explained why this is a big stretch, and Richard Epstein makes the case that if anyone in this drama is vulnerable to a possible obstruction charge, it\u2019s Mr. Comey.But whatever one believes about the President, the Post reports make Mr. Mueller\u2019s team look like political hacks focused on providing inappropriate leaks from an investigation just barely in progress, rather than professionals who are putting aside their politics to do a public service. This is assuming the Post reports are accurate.Yesterday, Deputy Attorney General       Rod Rosenstein      released this statement:Is he saying this is another case of fake news? If not, it suggests that Mr. Mueller has already made significant errors in staffing his investigation.***Bottom Stories of the DayTop Beltway Speed  \u201cTrump Orders Government to Stop Work on Y2K Bug, 17 Years Later,\u201d Bloomberg, June 15Irrational Exuberance?  \u201cA $664,000 Parking Spot Symbolizes Hong Kong\u2019s Property Frenzy,\u201d             New York Times,June 15Reunited And It Feels So Good  \u201cMan who said he robbed bank to get away from wife sentenced to home confinement,\u201d KDVR, June 15***#ThisIsJustToSay(With Apologies to William Carlos Williams)I have been readingYour plums and bitterer fruits.Forgive me; so tweet.-- Myles C.

Saudi Arabia and the U.A.E. defended the political status quo for the most part. Gas-rich Qatar took a different approach, emerging as an unlikely patron of change.\u201cThere is a conflict between forces sparring for change and others trying to maintain the old system, the status quo,\u201d said Salah Edin Elzein of the Doha-based Al Jazeera Center for Studies in Qatar, a think tank linked to the media outlet. \u201cThis is about Qatar\u2019s independent stand, internationally and on its internal affairs.\u201dPrevious U.S. administrations sought to keep peace between Gulf allies to maintain American interests in the region, notably military bases including the headquarters of Central Command, or Centcom, in Qatar.President Donald Trump supported the Saudi-led cutoff of Qatar while top officials at the State and Defense departments argued against it, U.S. officials said.The rift in the Gulf could compromise the U.S.-led fight against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, American and European officials said. The fight is run out of Qatar and involves an international coalition that includes Emirati and Saudi forces.\u201cThe logic has been: You can\u2019t piss off the Qataris because you can\u2019t close down Doha and CENTCOM,\u201d said a U.S. diplomat in the region, referring to the Central Command base.Underscoring America\u2019s ambivalent position on the Gulf rift, on Wednesday the U.S. and Qatar signed a preliminary $12 billion deal for the sale to Doha of             Boeing                   F-15 jet fighters.Qatar and its Arab rivals have embarked in a lobbying war in Washington, with Doha seeking help from the U.S. to resolve the dispute, while Abu Dhabi and Riyadh want the U.S. to back their efforts to isolate their neighbor.Qatar\u2019s foreign minister,       Sheikh Mohammed Al-Thani,        said Doha is willing to address and debunk accusations that it supports extremism, but that it won\u2019t bow to pressure to change its domestic or foreign policies.\u201cAnything related to our policies, to our principles here, this is something that is not for negotiation,\u201d he told reporters in Doha.Saudi Arabia and its regional allies have long complained about Qatar\u2019s maverick foreign policy, including its decision to host members of Islamist groups such as Egypt\u2019s Muslim Brotherhood and the Palestinian group Hamas, and its conciliatory approach toward Iran, Saudi Arabia\u2019s regional rival.Riyadh has also long accused Doha of using Al Jazeera to stoke opposition to governments from Cairo to Riyadh, and blocked the news channel last month.\u201cQatar helps political groups from all over the world. If someone is oppressed, they are willing to help,\u201d said       Mohammed Ghareeb,        a former Brotherhood lawyer who has been based in Doha since 2013, when Egypt\u2019s President Mohammed Morsi of the Brotherhood was ousted from power.Saudi Arabia and the U.A.E. \u201care not happy because this small country has raised its profile in the world,\u201d Mr. Ghareeb said.Qatar also has links to radical armed groups such as the al Qaeda-linked Syria Conquest Front and hosts the political office of Afghanistan\u2019s Taliban. These connections have enabled Doha to raise its profile by acting as a mediator between rival parties, for instance facilitating negotiations for the release of Western hostages held in Syria and providing a venue for tentative Afghan peace talks.But Qatar\u2019s critics say the country has been too accommodating to the demands of terror groups. That allegation resurfaced when the Qataris paid tens of millions of dollars this year to groups of militants allied with Iran and al Qaeda as ransom for releasing members of Doha\u2019s royal family who had been kidnapped in Afghanistan.The U.A.E., Saudi Arabia and their allies say they want to see a change of policy in Qatar, not a change of leadership. Reem al-Hashimi, the U.A.E.\u2019s Minister for International Cooperation, said Saudi Arabia and its allies decided at a recent summit to try to end what they deem to be Qatar\u2019s disruptive behavior.Mr. Trump, who also attended the meeting in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, assured the Saudi side at the time the U.S. would support efforts to fight terrorism in the region. In Riyadh, Mr. Trump also tried to rally leaders behind a campaign to push back against the influence of Iran, Saudi Arabia\u2019s regional rival.After Mr. Trump returned to the U.S., he publicly sided with Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies\u2014and suggested he was behind the diplomatic spat, saying it resulted from his pledge to fight extremism during the trip.\u201cIn Riyadh, there was a consensus among the Muslim brothers and sisters to really, in a way, draw a line in the sand,\u201d Ms. Hashimi said.\u2014Asa Fitch in Dubai contributed to this article.Write to Margherita Stancati at margherita.stancati@wsj.comAppeared in the June 17, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-06-16 15:19:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/gulf-allies-draw-u-s-into-mideast-rift-1497631696", "news_title": "Gulf Allies Draw U.S. Into Mideast Rift", "keywords": "centcom,fifth fleet,qatar cutoff,trump in mideast,u.s. mideast policy,Boeing Co.,BA,political,general news,international relations,politics"}, {"content": "Five years ago, the city of Timbuktu, Mali, was captured by a force of local and foreign jihadists who outgunned the poorly equipped and disastrously led Malian army and took control of the country\u2019s vast northern region. In a sequence of events familiar from places such as Raqqa in Syria and Mosul in Iraq, the local government was removed, an independent state announced, and a new order imposed based on a miserable mix of Shariah and thug law. The situation in Timbuktu was made more complicated by the fact that several different groups were fighting the Malian government and, at times, one another.A lack of state funding for the more tribal expanses of Mali\u2019s vast Saharan hinterland was one reason for local discontent with the government in the capital, Bamako, far away along the Niger River. Life has long been hard for the majority of Timbuktu\u2019s inhabitants. But the order imposed by the jihadists was a new low, with music\u2014a key ingredient of local culture\u2014banned and draconian punishments introduced, including hand-severing for theft and death by stoning for adultery.In \u201cThe Storied City,\u201d Charlie English, a former editor at the Guardian, unspools two parallel narratives about Timbuktu. One is the story of the attempt to preserve the city\u2019s heritage from jihadists; the other is the story of the century-long European search for the fabled city, supposedly so rich that its houses were covered in gold.By Charlie EnglishRiverhead, 400 pages, $28Though Timbuktu has long been a byword in the Western imagination for the mythical and wonderful, to people in the region it stands for other things. The city is renowned as a place of learning and the reputed resting place of 333 holy men. These holy men were scholars, and, because of them and others, Timbuktu is also known for its collections of manuscripts, some of which date to the 13th century.Under the jihadists, it was forbidden to show any reverence toward the tombs of the holy men. When foreign governments and agencies expressed their concern at the threat to Timbuktu\u2019s built heritage, the new rulers brought out the sledgehammers. Some feared that the manuscripts would be next.The story of the threat to the Timbuktu tombs is easily told. Mr. English quotes the dictum of one jihadist known as Redbeard: \u201cThe height of a tomb must not exceed the level of the ankle.\u201d If one did, \u201cyou must knock it down.\u201d The occupiers also believed that the people of Timbuktu were being led into sin by regarding these shrines as sacred. The international community\u2019s reverence for this built heritage added to the jihadists\u2019 motives for destroying it, an act that was soon accomplished since most tombs were simple mudbrick structures. Following a United Nations-sanctioned French military mission to restore government rule in the northern region, one of the jihadists was arrested and tried in the International Criminal Court, where he became the first person to be found guilty of the war crime of cultural destruction.The story of the manuscripts is more complicated. In the 14th century, Timbuktu was renowned for its wealth. The wealth attracted scholars, and they in turn produced manuscripts. Some of these were interpretations of Islamic law, some were prosaic business documents, and some were more esoteric and drew on both Islam and older, animist beliefs. Hundreds of thousands of pages ended up as family heirlooms, tucked away in trunks or buried in the ground. In 1973, with backing from the U.N., the Malian government created a library in Timbuktu, named after the 16th-century scholar Ahmad Baba. But it took another 25 years for the significance of the manuscripts to become clear. The impetus was a visit by the Harvard scholar       Henry Louis Gates Jr.      , who reportedly burst into tears when he saw the library because he knew that it would disprove the accepted belief that there was no written history in Africa, a canard encapsulated in Oxford historian       Hugh Trevor-Roper\u2019s       comment that \u201cthere is only the history of Europeans in Africa. The rest is darkness.\u201d South African President       Thabo Mbeki,        who also recognized the significance of the discovery, called for the construction of a new center for the library.For the first 10 years of this century, Mr. English recounts, funds and expertise poured into the city, and new libraries were established to house other family collections. The go-to man was       Abdel Kader Haidara,        who was the prime mover behind building up the Ahmad Baba library as well as establishing his family\u2019s Mamma Haidara Memorial Library. When jihadists began to show interest in the manuscripts, Mr. Haidara was the obvious contact person. By this time, he had created his own NGO, Savama\u2014\u201can institution,\u201d as Mr. English puts it, \u201cwith which the international donor community could do business.\u201d With significant financial backing and the goodwill of the world, Mr. Haidara saved the Timbuktu manuscripts by smuggling them away from the jihadists and shipping them to the safety of the capital. Or did he?Mr. Haidara has done so much to promote Timbuktu\u2019s cultural heritage and has been so highly praised that it is hard to single him out for blame. But one of the strengths of Mr. English\u2019s thoroughly researched book is his skeptical scrutiny of the manuscripts\u2019 heroic rescue. He catalogs inconsistencies suggesting that, amid the influx of donations, Mr. Haidara exaggerated the number of manuscripts, the threats they faced and the difficulty in shipping them. (Mr. Haidara denies any exaggeration, telling Mr. English: \u201cWe did not invent a story.\u201d) In the book\u2019s climactic scene, Mr. English asks Mr. Haidara to open a number of locked chests supposedly filled with manuscripts, and Mr. Haidara declines, saying, \u201cYou have to have trust.\u201dThe evacuation of the manuscripts was the subject of       Joshua Hammer\u2019s       \u201cThe Bad-Ass Librarians of Timbuktu\u201d (2016), a best seller that now reads like a hagiography of Mr. Haidara. Sales of Mr. English\u2019s book may suffer from following Mr. Hammer\u2019s, which is unfortunate, for it is both more insightful and much more interesting. Among many other things, it shows that the sort of willful delusion behind much of the 18th- and 19th-century quest for Timbuktu continues to this day, driven by what the author calls \u201cour inability to imagine the city\u2019s full complexity.\u201d That complexity includes an acceptance of multiple, conflicting truths. As Mr. Haidara says at the end of the book: \u201cIf everyone agreed what the story was, then it would certainly not be true.\u201d\u2014Mr. Sattin is the author of \u201cThe Gates of Africa: Death, Discovery and the Search for Timbuktu.\u201d He has recently been documenting endangered buildings in Mali as a partner in the mCubed Initiative.", "news_time": "2017-06-16 15:12:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-myths-and-books-of-timbuktu-1497640361", "news_title": "The Myths and Books of Timbuktu", "keywords": "bookcar0617,book review,recommended books,books,political,general news,national,public security,crime,legal action,arts,entertainment,politics,international relations,domestic politics,reviews"}, {"content": "\u2018Expedition,\u2019 \u201cexploration\u201d and \u201cdiscovery\u201d are terms more often associated with hardship and tragedy than beauty, pleasure or insightful reflection. When we think of explorers, figures like       Sir John Franklin       and his naval crew come to mind, disappearing in their fruitless search for the Northwest Passage, their final exit tarnished by desperate acts of cannibalism on the ice. We remember       Robert Falcon Scott       and his fellow travelers starving just 11 miles from a food depot on their arduous return from the South Pole in 1912.       James Cook       ended his third expedition badly, stabbed to death in Hawaii in 1779, while       Christa McAuliffe       and her fellow Challenger astronauts slipped \u201cthe surly bonds of earth\u201d to \u201ctouch the face of God\u201d on a disastrous space launch better remembered for       Ronald Reagan\u2019s       eulogy than the original purpose of their mission.By Huw Lewis-Jones & Kari HerbertChronicle, 320 pages, $40In \u201cExplorers\u2019 Sketchbooks,\u201d a selection of field notes and illustrations made by 70 different adventuresome travelers, Huw Lewis-Jones and       Kari Herbert       introduce us to the more peaceful and positive sides of exploration. The documents they offer capture the sense of wonder and awe that travel has evoked in many souls brave and lucky enough to have visited the world\u2019s remotest places.\u201cAll about us nature puts on the most thrilling adventure stories ever created,\u201d wrote       William Beebe,        an American naturalist who divided his career between deep ocean research and tropical exploration in the first half of the 20th century. \u201cTo some men the jungle is a tangled place of heat and danger. But, to the man who can see, its vines and plants form a beautiful and carefully ordered tapestry.\u201d Beebe was not an artist, but he worked closely with Else Bostelmann, who was. Mr. Lewis-Jones and Ms. Herbert reproduce five of her lively illustrations of the strange fish that Beebe observed swimming thousands of feet below the ocean\u2019s surface.\u201cAll artists are explorers,\u201d suggests       Tony Foster,        a British painter who has spent three decades documenting his own travels from the tropics to the Arctic. The reverse also seems to be true for most of the explorers included here, a diverse and intriguing group of men and women. Some have familiar names, but many are little-known. In each entry, a short but informative one-page biography precedes several pages of the striking images made during their expeditions. Almost everything shown makes us want to see more, and to learn more about the people who made them. To help with this, a full bibliography is provided.Several of the people included in the book are not artists (including       Chris Bonington,       Bruce Chatwin,       Vivian Fuchs,       Edmund Hillary,        Robert Scott,       Geoff Somers       and       Colin Thubron      ), but their notebooks, often accompanied by photographs of cultural artifacts or scientific specimens collected on their trips, are just as compelling as the sketchbooks of those who are.       Sir Ghillean Prance,        a botanist who has made more than 40 extended expeditions in search of plants, is one of five contemporary travelers who contributed essays to the book. In his \u201cGlorious Forest\u201d entry, he explains the importance of written and visual records in the discovery process. \u201cNotebooks are an essential part of my exploring kit,\u201d he writes. \u201cOther things of course are important in a practical sense . . . and each might mean the difference between life and death in the jungle. But, in terms of making a genuine contribution to knowledge, the careful marks that you make in a journal will be the things that outlive you.\u201dMr. Prance and the book\u2019s other essayists\u2014Mr. Foster,       Alan Bean,       David Ainley       and       Wade Davis      \u2014come at the subject from different perspectives (botany, art, space travel, biological investigation and anthropology), but all agree that the time spent recording and illustrating first impressions and life in the field is key to any explorer\u2019s experience and central to the spirit of exploration. The book is ample proof of their claims and an inspiring argument for the value of traveling with a purpose larger than oneself.When       Meriwether Lewis       set off on his journey across North America,       Thomas Jefferson       advised him that \u201cknowledge unrecorded is knowledge lost.\u201d Embracing this idea, Lewis returned with detailed diaries, many of them embellished with drawings of what he had seen. David Ainley, an ecologist who studies penguins, has taken this documentary approach on his own expeditions to Antarctica, creating notebooks that are an invaluable catalog of the observations he has made there. In his essay, \u201cIndispensable Friends,\u201d he makes the case for careful record keeping and describes his own diaries as \u201cmy most prized possessions.\u201dWade Davis, who has journeyed widely among isolated cultures, takes a more philosophical approach to travel. He characterizes each of his trips as a \u201cpilgrimage\u201d toward a goal \u201cwhich was not a place but a state of mind, not a destination but a path of illumination.\u201dThe book\u2019s author-editors have done a terrific job in selecting spectacular images and documents to reproduce. These range from       Henry Walter Bates\u2019s       watercolors of beetles from the Amazon to       Sven Hedin\u2019s       meticulous and evocative landscape drawings of Tibet; from sketches of icebergs drawn by the anthropologist       Franz Boas       while studying Inuit settlements in northern Canada in the 1880s to       David Livingstone\u2019s       1871 eyewitness account of a slave traders\u2019 massacre in a Congolese town, handwritten in berry juice on a scrap of salvaged newspaper.Especially notable, given the male bias of much exploration literature, are the dozen independent, talented and intrepid women featured in the book. Sailing to Suriname in the 17th century, the German illustrator       Maria Sibylla Merian       portrayed the lizards, snakes, plants, butterflies and caterpillars she saw there in riotous, accurate colors.       Gertrude Bell       sketched pottery shards while traveling in Samarra, Iraq.       Marianne North,        a friend of       Charles Darwin,        circled the globe twice in the 1800s in what the authors call \u201cher mission to paint as many different species of plants as she could find.\u201d Included in her six-page entry are some of her stunning oil paintings from India and Japan.Anyone with an interest in travel will find \u201cExplorers\u2019 Sketchbooks\u201d a source of inspiration. Even those well versed in exploration history will discover new information here. \u201cIf this book can inspire someone to sit a while, to watch and listen, and to draw or jot some thoughts down,\u201d say its authors, \u201cthen the effort in making it has its reward.\u201d\u2014Mr. Peck serves as chronicler, photographer and historian of research expeditions for the Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University.", "news_time": "2017-06-16 15:11:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-art-of-adventure-1497640264", "news_title": "The Art of Adventure", "keywords": "bookcar0617,book review,recommended books,art,books,political,general news,arts,entertainment,reviews"}, {"content": "Illinois lawmakers will return for a special session next week to address a historic budget impasse, but the two sides still seem far apart.Republican Gov.

He presided over the reunification of Germany in 1990 and was one of the main drivers of Europe\u2019s monetary union. He helped elevate German Chancellor       Angela Merkel       to the national stage but fell out with her years later.\u2018He will live on in our recollection as a great European and as the chancellor of unity.

Mr. Kohl died at 9:15 on Friday morning in his house in Ludwigshafen,       Kai Diekmann,        the former editor of the Bild tabloid and a close friend of the Kohl family, said.\u201cWe can all be thankful for that which Helmut Kohl did in his many years of service for us Germans and our country,\u201d Ms. Merkel said. \u201cHe will live on in our recollection as a great European and as the chancellor of unity. I bow down before his memory.\u201dFormer U.S. President       Bill Clinton       said Mr. Kohl \u201cwas called upon to answer some of the most monumental questions of his time, and in answering them correctly he made possible the reunification of a strong, prosperous Germany and the creation of the European Union.... History continues to prove that he delivered.\u201dReacting to the news of Mr. Kohl\u2019s death, European Commission President       Jean-Claude Juncker       praised his role in the foundation of the European single currency. \u201cRight from the beginning, he grasped the political and economic significance, the vital importance and the appeal of a single currency for our continent,\u201d he said. French President       Emmanuel Macron       praised the \u201creformer, visionary, and unifier\u201d for deepening the Franco-German relationship.A towering figure at 6 feet 4 inches tall, with a massive frame, Mr. Kohl was often dismissed by opponents as an intellectual lightweight. But he showed shrewd instinct and leadership by stepping into a dangerous power vacuum in the months of uncertainty after the Berlin Wall was opened on Nov. 9, 1989.Grasping the opportunity, Mr. Kohl swiftly charted a course to German unity, secured the Soviet Union\u2019s acquiescence through checkbook diplomacy and swept aside domestic doubts and practical hurdles.\u2018[Mr. Kohl was] the right man in the right place at the historically right moment.\u2019He overcame the misgivings of neighbors worried about a stronger Germany by pledging to integrate the country more closely into what was then called the European Community and even surrender the mighty deutsche mark. That helped convince them that a unified Germany would remain a reliable member of Western alliances such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.Former Soviet leader       Mikhail Gorbachev       later described him as \u201cthe right man in the right place at the historically right moment.\u201dAvuncular, jovial, Catholic, staunchly conservative and fond of stuffed pig\u2019s stomach, a delicacy of his home region of Rhineland Palatinate, Mr. Kohl won the trust of his counterparts not least because he embodied reassuringly West German traits\u2014a yearning for comfort and security and a deep loyalty to the U.S.Mr. Kohl was born April 3, 1930, in the southwestern city of Ludwigshafen, the youngest of three children. His father was a mid-ranking civil servant in the local tax office.At an early age, he revealed a taste for being in charge, once dressing up as a bishop with a coffee cozy as a miter and a bed sheet as a cloak, and ordering his friends to carry his train, his late sister, Hildegard, recalled.World War II brought his sheltered childhood to an abrupt end. At age 12, he was drafted into a unit to remove rubble following Allied bombing raids on Ludwigshafen. His older brother was killed in action in 1944.Mr. Kohl\u2019s early encounters with the terror of war had a defining influence on his foreign policy. His mantra: Deep economic integration in Europe was key to ensuring peace and to rehabilitating Germany on the world stage.\u201cWe want to honor the dead and tend to the graves but we never again want to have soldiers\u2019 tombs in Europe. That is the most important reason for a united Europe,\u201d a teary-eyed Mr. Kohl said in a May 2004 speech marking the accession of eight Eastern European countries, as well as Cyprus and Malta, to the EU.After the war, Mr. Kohl studied history and political science in Frankfurt and Heidelberg. He financed his studies by working in a factory owned by chemical company             BASF.       It won him plaudits in his early political career because it was hard, manual labor involving grinding sandstone slabs for use in construction.A strong interest in current affairs, combined with irrepressible ambition, led him into politics. He rose rapidly through the ranks of the conservative, Catholic-dominated CDU, overcoming his lack of oratorical skill with a boundless self-confidence aided by his physical stature. He was only 39 when he became governor of Rhineland-Palatinate in 1969.Mr. Kohl\u2019s regional accent and provincial background made him a target for satirists. The \u201cKohl joke\u201d became a genre in itself. But his small-town unpretentiousness struck a chord with middle-class Germans, and his conservatives emerged as the largest party in a 1976 election, failing to form a government only because the small, business-friendly Free Democrats remained loyal to the center-left Social Democrats.In October 1982, Social Democratic Chancellor       Helmut Schmidt\u2019s       coalition collapsed in a dispute over economic measures and the stationing by the U.S. of more nuclear missiles in West Germany. The Free Democrats switched their support to the Christian Democrats and parliament elected Mr. Kohl as chancellor. He then led his party to a general-election win in March 1983.His early years in office were marked by gaffes and minor scandals. Mr. Kohl caused controversy by visiting Arab states before he went to Israel. For the 40th anniversary of the end of World War II, he invited President       Ronald Reagan       to visit a German war cemetery in Bitburg where the 2,000 graves turned out to include 48 members of the Waffen SS.But the image of Mr. Kohl and French President Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand hand in hand in 1984 at a French military cemetery in Verdun, site of one of the bloodiest battles of World War I, became an enduring symbol of European reconciliation.Mr. Kohl easily won re-election in 1987, helped by a buoyant economy. He shunned unpopular but needed changes to an increasingly bloated social-welfare system. But his patriarchal style of government and tendency to confine policy decisions to a small group of confidants led to mounting criticism.With his focus on continuity, his legacy wasn\u2019t shaping up to much until 1989, when he seized the opportunity that history offered his country.Less than three weeks after the fall of the Berlin Wall, he presented a 10-point plan for Germany\u2019s future\u2014without consulting either his own top advisers or the leaders of the U.S., the Soviet Union or France. He had drafted it in his family home in Oggersheim, near Ludwigshafen, with two local friends and his wife Hannelore, who typed up the document.On Dec. 19, 1989, tens of thousands of elated East Germans cheered in Dresden when he promised unity with the words \u201cGod bless our German fatherland!\u201dSome European leaders, including U.K. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, were aghast, fearing reunification would lead to renewed German nationalism and domination in Europe.Nonetheless, his knack for shirt-sleeve diplomacy disarmed foreign leaders, and helped build trust with Messrs. Gorbachev and Mitterrand as well as U.S. President       George H.W. Bush.       Mr. Kohl also sought to lessen fears over the \u201cGerman question\u201d by driving forward the idea of a common European currency, despite deep misgivings at home over losing the trusted mark.Mr. Kohl easily won re-election in 1990 on a tide of gratitude from eastern Germans. But his popularity waned in both East and West as the costs of unification became clear, and he struggled to clinch his fourth term in 1994.Critics accused him of clinging to power and missing his chance to make a dignified exit that would have helped his party. He denied his heir-apparent,       Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble,        the chance to run for chancellor in 1998 and then lost his bid for a fifth term.\u2018Of course in the beginning I needed courage to go against him\u2026But now I can bear it.\u2019The biggest blow to Mr. Kohl\u2019s reputation came with the revelation in 1999 of his involvement in a party-funding scandal. He admitted accepting two million marks (about $1 million at the time) in illegal campaign contributions while he was chancellor, but refused to name the donors.He was fined 300,000 marks. His former prot\u00e9g\u00e9e Angela Merkel, whom he had plucked from obscurity in 1990, called on the CDU to distance itself from him, and he was pressured into resigning as the party\u2019s honorary leader.\u201cI am one of those who can say: I became who I am first through Helmut Kohl,\u201d Ms. Merkel said in a 1998 interview. \u201cOf course in the beginning I needed courage to go against him\u2026But now I can bear it.\u201dHis fall from grace was such that he wasn\u2019t invited to speak at the 10th anniversary of German unification in 2000. Mr. Kohl insisted he was the victim of a campaign by what he called \u201chysterical\u201d media and \u201cputschists\u201d among his former allies to discredit him.Mr. Kohl\u2019s relationship with Ms. Merkel, who took his mantle both as CDU leader and, later, chancellor, never completely healed. Among Mr. Kohl\u2019s last public appearances was a meeting with Hungary\u2019s Prime Minister       Viktor Orb\u00e1n,        an outspoken critic of Ms. Merkel\u2019s open-door migration policy, in April last year.A further blow came in July 2001 when Hannelore, his wife of 41 years, committed suicide, prompting media coverage of his private life and of the price his family had paid for his years in power.Mrs. Kohl had been confined to their home in Oggersheim with a rare allergy that forced her to avoid sunlight. Mr. Kohl was frequently absent, networking in Berlin to restore his reputation.His subsequent relationship with       Maike Richter,        a former member of his chancellery staff who was 34 years his junior, worsened a rift with his two sons, who weren\u2019t invited to their wedding in 2008.After suffering a concussion from a fall in 2008, Mr. Kohl was often confined to a wheelchair. He rarely made public appearances but occasionally, during the euro crisis, implored the new generation of leaders not to undo his legacy.Abroad, he has been lauded as one of the greatest leaders of the 20th century, receiving a plethora of honors including the U.S. Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1999. At home the verdict has been ambivalent after the heady days of unification, when he basked in the nation\u2019s joy.\u201cMaybe not that many people will be able to love Kohl as a human being and a power politician,\u201d the conservative daily Die Welt commented in 2009. \u201cBut for his achievements as a German and international statesman, he deserves admiration\u2014and yes, gratitude.\u201d\u2014Andrea Thomas contributed to this article.Write to Harriet Torry at harriet.torry@wsj.com and Anton Troianovski at anton.troianovski@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-16 15:02:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/helmut-kohl-chancellor-who-reunified-germany-dies-1497630130", "news_title": "Helmut Kohl, Chancellor Who Reunified Germany, Dies", "keywords": "Helmut Kohl,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,elections,national,presidential elections"}, {"content": "For most of             Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s        AMZN 0.24%       23-year history, the online retailer steered clear of bulky acquisitions, instead picking off small startups and choosing to build products and business lines on its own, be it an e-reader, a movie business or a monstrous cloud computing network.That all changed on Friday.Amazon\u2019s $13.7 billion deal to buy             Whole Foods Market Inc.             dwarfs any previous acquisition by more than a factor of 10 and brings a new level of scale and complexity for the online retailer to digest.The company\u2019s largest acquisition came in 2009, when it purchased Zappos.com Inc. for $1.2 billion. The online shoe retailer fit snugly into Amazon\u2019s main business, and its under-2,000 employee workforce was relatively easy to absorb.Whole Foods has about 90,000 workers spread around 460 stores in over 40 states and three countries, a real-estate footprint that totals six Empire State Buildings\u2019 worth of space. The staff alone increases Amazon\u2019s workforce of 341,000 by roughly one-fourth, and it would make a giant leap into bricks and mortar stores for a company that has long loathed physical retail and only recently began operating a handful of stores.With scant detail from Amazon, Wall Street was full of questions Friday as to how the acquisition would transform the Seattle retailer. How would Whole Foods fit in with Amazon\u2019s Prime delivery service? What does it mean for Amazon\u2019s nascent grocery-delivery business? Will Amazon stock Whole Foods with its hardware offerings and books, or leave it untouched as its own unit?But one point was clear: the sheer size is a new thing.Mark Mahaney,        an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, wrote in a note to clients that while Amazon has been trying to get some bookstores off the ground, \u201cthe company has always veered away from physical retail presences.\u201dBy contrast, other Amazon deals have, on their face, appeared far more intuitive or easy to swallow. Its roster of deals\u2014totaling 92 over the past two decades, according to Thomson Reuters\u2014has included dozens of e-commerce, logistics and online search companies.In March, Amazon struck a deal to acquire Dubai-based Souq.com, one of the Middle East\u2019s largest e-commerce businesses that offers over 8.4 million products. And while Amazon strayed a bit far afield from its main business with the 2014 purchase of online video-gaming company Twitch Interactive for $970 million, that startup had just 170 employees working out of a small San Francisco office.Even for large deals that seem to fit with Amazon\u2019s DNA, headaches have arisen. In March, Amazon announced it was shutting down its Quidsi unit, the owner of Diapers.com, which Amazon picked up in 2010 for $545 million, because it couldn\u2019t make it profitable.And Zappos, run as its own autonomous unit, faced an exodus of 14% of its core staff two years ago amid a rocky\u00a0transition to a management system in which employees don\u2019t have bosses.", "news_time": "2017-06-16 15:02:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/will-whole-foods-give-amazon-indigestion-1497639762", "news_title": "Will Whole Foods Give Amazon Indigestion?

Instagram this week announced a new initiative to get its users to add a \u201cpaid partnership\u201d label to sponsored posts. And now, packaged-goods review site Influenster is rolling out a new tool called Real-Time Disclosure Monitor that flags when people getting free product samples are not including proper disclosures in their social media posts.The company has a program through which it sends new product samples, like makeup or pet food, to around 1 million members (not all receive the same products at the same time). When those members sign up, Influenster asks them to connect through their social media logins. The site can then track their posts -- on Facebook, for example -- and identify and analyze photos and terms in the context of their reviews and comments.For example, when looking for keywords like \u201cfree,\u201d \u201ccomplimentary\u201d or \u201csponsored,\u201d the algorithm can identify when a term is used in the context of the post, such as \u201cmy hair is dandruff-free,\u201d versus a disclosure, such as, \u201cI received this product for free,\u201d said Influenster Chief Product Officer Emre Yenilmis.When the tool finds FTC violations, such as a person not disclosing they are a paid endorser of the product that Influenster supplied, Influenster immediately sends emails to the users in violation, reminding them that they need to include the proper disclosures. The site will suspend repeat offenders from brand campaigns and will ban them indefinitely from the platform if they don\u2019t disclose after \u201cnumerous warnings,\u201d the company said.When it began using the tool over four months ago, Influenster found that about 15% to 20% of its users weren\u2019t using proper FTC disclosures and sent them notes. The percentage of violators has since dropped to about 5%, the company said.Influenster said its tool is designed to notify users directly, rather than the FTC.According to the FTC\u2019s endorsement guides, both marketers and endorsers should conspicuously disclose a \u201cmaterial connection,\u201d such as a monetary payment, business or family relationship or free product gift, that could affect the credibility of the endorsement. If the FTC finds that the social media blogger violates its rules, and ultimately its broader FTC Act, the advertiser and/or blogger could be forced to \u201cgive up money they received from their violations.\u201dThe effort comes as more people use social media on mobile devices, where an endorsement disclosure may be difficult to see. One point the FTC drove home in its letters was that people looking at Instagram on mobile devices typically see only the first few lines of a longer post until they click \u201cmore.\u201d The letters encouraged endorsers on Instagram to disclose their connection with the brand above that \u201cmore\u201d button.Influenster currently has no plans to white-label the technology or generate revenue from the tool.The tool gives brands \u201cthe confidence to run their campaigns\u201d as Influenster expands globally, according to a statement from the company. The site has more than three million members across the U.S., U.K., and Canada and has plans to expand to Latin America, continental Europe and Asia.\u201cInfluenster has always prioritized disclosure above everything else,\u201d said Mr. Yenilmis in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019ve made social compliance the bedrock from which all our brand campaigns stem.\u201dWrite to Alexandra Bruell at alexandra.bruell@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-16 14:39:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/influenster-tool-tracks-social-posts-compliance-with-ftc-rules-1497638347", "news_title": "Influenster Tool Tracks Social Posts\u2019 Compliance With FTC Rules", "keywords": "Federal Trade Commission,regulation,government policy,new products,services,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,living,lifestyle,social media"}, {"content": "The number of rigs drilling for oil in the U.S. rose by 6 to 747 in the past week, according to oil-field services company         Baker Hughes Inc.The U.S. oil-rig count typically is viewed as a proxy for activity in the sector.After peaking at 1,609 in October 2014, production was weighed by low oil prices, and the rig count receded.

It is also expanding its online grocery pickup service to around a thousand stores and testing the use of store workers to deliver online orders on their way home from work.Earlier this month Amazon took direct aim at Wal-Mart by discounting its Prime membership program for shoppers on government assistance, a core Wal-Mart cohort.Wal-Mart executives have repeatedly cited their massive U.S store base as an advantage over Amazon. \u201cWill it be easier for an e-commerce company to build out a massive store network and create a customer service culture at scale? Or are we better able to add digital and supply chain capabilities and leverage our existing stores?\u201d Chief Executive       Doug McMillon       told investors in 2015. At the time, Wal-Mart discussed a plan to invest billions of dollars in online operations and stores, triggering a steep selloff in stock.Since then Wal-Mart has put particular focus on improving the quality and selection of fresh produce and meat, adding new lighting and more organic food to the section, in part because those items are primarily bought in stores.Only around 9% of households who shopped at Whole Foods in April also shopped at a Wal-Mart, according to data from Kantar Retail. \u201cOutside of Texas, there just aren\u2019t that many areas that matter to Wal-Mart\u2019s grocery business that also matter to Whole Foods,\u201d said Bryan Gildenberg, analyst at Kantar. Still, Amazon could bring Whole Foods \u201cto a much larger audience\u201d over time, he said.Wal-Mart\u2019s digital push is an extreme departure from its historical model of building hundreds of new stores each year to grow sales. The shift has ruffled some feathers internally and externally, say people familiar with the situation.

Her positive steps for building a culture of free and open discourse are wholesome. However, Middlebury\u2019s disciplinary actions in response to the violation of Charles Murray\u2019s right to speak and the right of others to hear him were toothless, and President Patton gives no indication that the policies governing such egregious offenses will change.Elsewhere, Middlebury knows how to be firm. Its College Handbook states: \u201cAny infraction of the honor system is normally punishable by suspension from the College.\u201d Does the silencing of an invited speaker and the assault on a faculty member really merit so much weaker a response? Arguably, the students who prevented Dr. Murray from speaking did something worse. They cut at the heart of free inquiry and norms of civil discourse. Severely disciplining students is never pleasant, but without appropriate penalties, President Patton\u2019s vision is a quixotic aspiration.Middlebury\u2019s administration, with the active guidance of its trustees, has a duty to establish and enforce sanctions that will deter such outrages in the future.Michael B. Poliakoff, Ph.D.PresidentAmerican Council ofTrustees and AlumniWashingtonI am disappointed with Dr. Patton\u2019s essay. It\u2019s impossible to find fault with her endorsement of free debate and civility on campuses, but how can Middlebury hope to discourage future incidents of this type when those found responsible for violence and intimidation are not held to account in any real sense? Most of the students involved were given probation (i.e., a free pass this time), while a letter was placed in the file of a select few whose role was labeled especially prominent.

Here in California almost everyone once thought like him until the reality of unregulated immigration set in.The mantra that was repeated so often was that these poor economic refugees only wanted to do the work that Americans wouldn\u2019t do. What everyone failed to see were the many peripheral costs that have become overwhelming. Imagine that one illegal immigrant takes a minimum-wage job (a job that used to go to teenagers beginning their climb on the economic ladder) and then has, or brings into the country, five children who now go through the local school system at $10,000 a year per child, and one gets a glimpse at one of the many expenses hidden behind the curtain by the open-border folks.In Orange County one can clearly see the social costs of unregulated immigration as well. Small, post-World War II ranch-style houses built with two bedrooms and one bath are now home to as many as five families, with the resultant pressure on infrastructure and social services. Local food banks are overwhelmed, and crimes of all types have increased. Once beautiful jewels, like the city of Santa Ana, have become crime-ridden and dangerous, full of gang members openly flouting their affiliations while plying their criminal enterprises.

Here\u2019s what you need to know about the deal:Soon, Whole Foods locations could be much more than just a place to buy organic pears. Amazon could be viewing Whole Foods\u2019s 11 regional distribution centers and its 440 U.S. stores as a faster and more convenient way to reach its customers. The deal buttresses Amazon\u2019s famed logistics engine, which already includes more than 70 U.S. fulfillment centers. Customers would likely be able to get faster and fresher food from Amazon along with access to the vast array of other products Amazon offers. The deal could also catapult expansion plans for its locker pickup services and same-day delivery regions.The deal is Amazon\u2019s biggest ever\u2014by a huge margin\u2014at more than 10 times the size of its 2014 purchase of videogame streamer Twitch Interactive Inc. for $970 million. If it wanted, Amazon has enough cash and current assets to pay for the deal, but it would significantly cut into its holdings. As of March, it had $15.44 billion in cash and equivalents and $6.1 billion in marketable securities. Amazon says it expects to finance the deal with debt and cash on hand.Shares of grocery competitors fell sharply after the deal was announced over worries that the industry, which was already facing a tough year, would now have to contend with Amazon. Shares of         Wal-Mart Stores Inc.dropped 4.4%, shaving about $12 billion off the company\u2019s market capitalization\u2014not too far off the entire amount Amazon is spending to buy Whole Foods.         Kroger Co.shares fell 12%,         Supervalu Inc.       shares fell 14%,         Target Corp.       shares fell 7% and         Costco Wholesale Corp.       shares fell 5.8%. Will Amazon do to grocers what it did to booksellers?Amazon\u2019s move shows that its small forays into storefronts and square feet in recent years were more than just a test. It now has eight open Amazon bookstores that sell Kindle readers and tablets in addition to books, two drive-in grocery stores and has been working to open a cashier-less convenience store.Grocery remains a largely fragmented sector, with the top 10 retailers controlling 45% of the market, according to         Cowen Inc.,       and the rest being controlled by grocery chains, convenience stores, dollar stores and independent sellers. Still, Moody\u2019s Vice President Mickey Chadha expects Amazon and its financial capacity to price aggressively, hurting smaller regional supermarket chains and independent operators the most\u2014and he expects more consolidation in the industry.Activist hedge fund Jana Partners LLC, the company\u2019s second-largest shareholder with a roughly 7% stake, stands to make about $400 million, a huge return on its investment in only a few months. Jana took its stake in Whole Foods earlier this year and had been agitating for a turnaround. According to a filing, Jana paid about $705.6 million for its stake, or about $26.81 a share.

Here are five areas to watch:TravelBy far the biggest effect of Mr. Trump\u2019s regulatory tightening is expected to fall on individual travelers, who will see stronger enforcement of laws against American tourism in Cuba. Airlines could see a drop-off in passengers as travelers face a greater burden of showing that their trips are centered on educational or other approved purposes, and that they\u2019re not doing business with hotels or restaurants controlled by the Cuban military or intelligence apparatus. Regulations still must be developed, but Treasury officials Friday provided some initial guidance.Agricultural and Medical TradeMost trade with Cuba is blocked by longstanding laws put in place by Congress, and neither Mr. Trump nor Mr. Obama have changed the underlying U.S. embargo. Still, the law allows for agricultural and medical exports to Cuba, and the U.S. has sent $83.4 million in goods to Cuba in the first four months of this year. Farmers see big potential in selling rice, poultry and other products to Cuba, but those sales still aren\u2019t practical because U.S. law blocks the kind of credit needed to ease those shipments.DiplomacyThe U.S. and Cuba restored diplomatic relations and reopened embassies in Washington and Havana in 2015, after the U.S. removed Cuba from the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism. In January 2017, before leaving office, President Barack Obama eliminated the so-called \u201cwet foot, dry foot\u201d policy that allowed Cuban \u00e9migr\u00e9s who reached U.S. soil without visas to stay in the country and apply for a green card after one year. Cuba supported that change in U.S. policy. All of the diplomatic changes will remain in place, under Mr. Trump\u2019s directive.However, some U.S. approaches will change. Last year the U.S. abstained for the first time from an annual United Nations vote on ending the embargo against Cuba, a shift from prior years. That\u2019s likely to change this year, as Mr. Trump\u2019s policy directive says that the U.S. should oppose efforts at the U.N. to end the embargo, until conditions change on the island.Technology and TelecommunicationsThe Obama administration loosened regulations to try to foster more internet and telecommunications access on the island, including allowing American cellphone carriers to strike roaming agreements with Cuba\u2019s state-run telecommunications monopoly, so that American phones work on the island. Google in April launched data servers in Cuba after signing an agreement with Cuba last December to place servers on the island and speed up internet access. The Trump administration\u2019s policy shift will allow for the continuation of these kinds of actions and still aims to expand telecommunications and internet access on the island.Finance and RemittancesThe Obama administration removed caps on remittances Americans could send to the island, a change which will stay in force under Mr. Trump\u2019s directive. The Obama administration also took steps to foster banking relationships between the U.S. and Cuba, expand the use of U.S. dollars and pave the way for American credit cards to work on the island, which will also stay the same.Write to Felicia Schwartz at Felicia.Schwartz@wsj.com and William Mauldin at william.mauldin@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-16 14:16:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-trump-will-change-u-s-policies-toward-cuba-1497636976", "news_title": "How Trump Will Change U.S. Policies Toward Cuba ", "keywords": "cuba,embargo,travel,trump,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics"}, {"content": "General Motors Co.        GM 0.11%       said\u00a0Friday\u00a0it would open a supplier park near its Arlington, Texas, sport-utility factory, resulting in the relocation of about 600 jobs from Mexico to the U.S. and a higher concentration of American-made parts in Chevrolet Suburbans and Cadillac Escalades.Many of those U.S. employees will work for Luxembourg-based interiors supplier International Automotive Components Group, founded by billionaire investor and U.S. Commerce Secretary       Wilbur Ross.       IAC will anchor the supplier facility.The decision comes as the Trump administration considers changes to the North American Free Trade Agreement and as Republican lawmakers weigh a border-adjusted tax, both of which could make it more expensive for companies to import parts from abroad. Boosting the number of U.S.-made parts could alleviate some trade risk for GM\u2019s most-profitable vehicles, the hulking SUVs assembled at its Arlington factory.Analysts estimate that profit margins on the SUVs can exceed $15,000. Any tariff on the trucks\u2019 components could pinch profits.GM is one of several manufacturers rethinking the wisdom of shipping intermediate products through far-flung supply chains. Once thought of as a strategy to lower costs, overreliance on a global parts network is perceive to be a risky bet due to political shifts, protectionist measures and even natural disasters.The auto maker earlier this year announced plans to add about 1,500 factory jobs in the U.S. in the wake of public criticism from President Donald Trump of GM\u2019s Mexican imports.The company said both the 1,500 jobs and the 600 supplier jobs were planned\u00a0before Mr. Trump\u2019s election. The new supplier park is aimed at trimming logistical costs and benefiting from of other advantages that could result from proximity of parts to the assembly plant, GM purchasing chief       Steve Kiefer       said in an interview\u00a0Friday.Mr. Trump has set in motion a renegotiation of the 23-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement, which has set the ground rules for Detroit and foreign-based auto makers operating in the U.S., Canada and Mexico.The SUVs assembled at GM\u2019s Arlington plant have among the highest Mexican content of any vehicles produced in North America, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The SUVs contain 49% U.S.-or Canada-made components, while 38% of the parts come from Mexico, the agency says.Among U.S. officials\u2019 most frequently mentioned objectives for Nafta talks is a revamp of the \u201crules of origin,\u201d which regulate how much of a car\u2014or auto part\u2014must be produced in North America to be eligible for duty-free shipment across the Mexican or Canadian borders.Shifting some parts production north to Texas reduces the risk of costs related to a border tax that U.S. lawmakers have proposed, potential tariffs Mr. Trump has threatened, or a newly negotiated Nafta. Mr. Trump has even threatened to pull the U.S. out of Nafta, a move that would likely result in immediate tariffs at the border.GM Chief Executive       Mary Barra       is a member of Mr. Trump\u2019s business council. The jobs announcement comes as GM trims thousands of assembly jobs in the U.S. to counter sluggish sedan sales.GM next year will open a 1.2 million square-foot facility on the site of a former retail mall less than 2 miles from the factory. A handful of suppliers are expected to locate in the facility.IAC supplies some content for the current SUVs, but won more business on the next-generation trucks, which industry analysts expect to go on sale in 2019. IAC will supply the bulk of the truck\u2019s interiors, including consoles, instrument panels and door trim.About 1,250 hourly and salaried workers from IAC and other suppliers will work at the facility. Roughly 600 of those employees will replace work that had previously been done by suppliers in Mexico, GM spokesman Nick Richards said.GM has located supplier operations near several other U.S. assembly plants in recent years to cut logistics costs, Mr. Kiefer said. The setup reduces inventory, makes it easier to tweak production schedules and can help spot and fix quality lapses more quickly, he said.The strategy is part of a broader effort by GM to squeeze out $6.5 billion in annual costs by 2018, compared with four years earlier. Mr. Kiefer said savings from supplier parks and other logistical moves is contributing about $1 billion to that goal.Mr. Kiefer acknowledged that some of those savings are offset by higher labor costs in Texas compared with overseas markets but called it \u201ca positive trade off.\u201d He said the creation of U.S. jobs is \u201ca great byproduct\u201d of the strategy but said it wasn\u2019t the primary factor.Write to Mike Colias at Mike.Colias@wsj.com and William Mauldin at william.mauldin@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-16 14:12:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/gm-expects-to-move-600-supplier-jobs-from-mexico-to-texas-1497634381", "news_title": "GM Expects To Move 600 Supplier Jobs From Mexico to Texas ", "keywords": "assembly plant,escalade,jobs,labor,labour unions,mexican factory,nafta,north american free trade agreement,pickups,texas,workers,General Motors,GM,personnel,corporate,industrial news,trade,external payments,physical trade,economic news,cars,political,general news,international relations,living,lifestyle,politics,motor vehicles,passenger cars,sports utility vehicles,motor vehicle parts,automotive"}, {"content": "When 11-year-old Joplin\u2019s grandfather dies, she finds among his belongings a cookie tin containing the broken pieces of a 17th-century Delftware platter.

This wartime London novel of espionage and blackmail is as immersive as a fever dream. Shot through with lies and secrets, it is animated by a powerful sense of dread.

The ominous blackouts, \u201cthe ice-like tinkle of broken glass being swept up among crisping leaves\u201d and the unexpected effects that this climate of danger had on people are superbly portrayed: \u201cWartime, with its makeshifts, shelvings, deferring, could not have been kinder to romantic love.\u201d Stella and Robert are the lovers here.

There she met the model for Joy, this novel\u2019s heroine: \u201cWe became close friends and we still are close friends,\u201d she wrote in her 2013 preface. \u201cPoor Cow was . . . a mixture of Joy and what happened to her, and also what happened to me.\u201d To follow the blithe run of Joy\u2019s voice as it segues between uncensored inner monologue, verbatim dialogue and mis-spelled love letters to her boyfriend in prison feels like eavesdropping on the spirit of the \u201960s. She and her infant son revel in each other with a tenderly observed sensuality: \u201cShe couldn\u2019t get over his lovely legs and little square feet.\u201d She works as a barmaid and makes a little extra cash sometimes from men, but when her friend suggests \u201cgoing up West to earn a bomb,\u201d she says: \u201cNo, Beryl, I value my sex too much, it\u2019s all I\u2019ve got; you lose the pleasure of it if you turn professional.\u201dBy       Arnold Bennett       (1923)4. Henry Earlforward, owner of a second-hand bookshop in \u201cthat dingy and sordid neighbourhood\u201d of Clerkenwell, is one of literature\u2019s great misers. When he marries widowed Violet, rather than buy a new wedding ring he files the old one off her finger and uses the proceeds from selling the gold to buy a cheaper band. Her wedding present to Henry, the expense of which horrifies him, is to hire someone to vacuum-clean his grimy shop. When the cleaners assure him they will take away the dirt, he asks, \u201cDo you sell it? Do you get anything for it?\u201d Freud would have had a field day! Henry\u2019s \u201cextraordinary soft obstinacy\u201d triumphs horribly in the end but the sympathetic subtlety of his portrait fascinates rather than repels. The overcrowded squares of Clerkenwell, the filth of trams and horse-drawn vans\u2014all are detailed with careful particularity, down to the \u201cmuffled uproar\u201d of the new underground railway.By       Muriel Spark       (1988)5. From the first sentences buoyantly assuring you that insomnia is not bad in itself but can be used for reverie, this novel\u2019s surface is deceptive. The narrator, 28-year-old war widow Mrs. Hawkins, lives with fellow lodgers in a tall thin house in Kensington Church Street. It is 1954, and she works for a publishing firm, informally dispensing advice on how to write a novel (\u201cWrite privately, not publicly; without fear or timidity\u201d), how to find a job, how to say no. When she realizes that people view her as \u201ca matronly goddess of wisdom\u201d because she is fat, she loses weight. She also conducts a bitter feud with would-be writer Hector Bartlett, a character based on       Derek Stanford,        Spark\u2019s own friend and literary partner in the 1950s, who later, much to her rage, sold her letters and published a memoir. This novel wrestles with malice and secrecy and paranoia; there are anonymous letters, a fall into insanity, a suicide. Despite its seeming sunniness, this is in fact a revenge comedy.", "news_time": "2017-06-16 13:50:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/helen-simpson-1497635456", "news_title": "Helen Simpson", "keywords": "bookcar0617,book review,books,arts,entertainment,reviews"}, {"content": "One of the most poignant scenes in       Sebastian Junger\u2019s       new documentary, \u201cHell on Earth,\u201d shows a Syrian family in the back of a smuggler\u2019s utility truck, a large vehicle with high metal walls surrounding the cargo bed. Huddled under a tarp, they are trying to escape from their home in Manbij, at the time in an Islamic State-controlled area, and reach Turkey.Three children, who look to be under the age of 6, give a small smile as another member of the family records video of their 15-minute border crossing on a smartphone. In the film, the father says, \u201cDuring those 15 minutes, I felt like I died 100,000 times.\u201dThe film, which premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival in April and is now being shown on the National Geographic Channel, connects Syria\u2019s descent into civil war with the rise of Islamic State, mixing footage of the battles in the country with expert interviews, Islamic State recruitment videos and personal stories of Syrians trying to escape. The crew gave smartphones to a handful of civilians so they could document their experiences.Mr. Junger, 55, who co-directed the film, wanted to highlight the human hardships and costs of the war, without taking a conservative or liberal perspective. \u201cI think most documentary filmmakers are actually activists, not journalists,\u201d he says. \u201cJournalists shouldn\u2019t set out to deliberately make people think a certain way, but it is good to lay out the facts in a way that allows for some emotion.\u201d\u201cHell on Earth\u201d builds on Mr. Junger\u2019s 25 years as a war reporter. Along with writing nonfiction books such as \u201cThe Perfect Storm\u201d (1997), \u201cWar\u201d (2010) and \u201cTribe\u201d (2016), he has directed and produced several documentary films. His 2010 film \u201cRestrepo,\u201d which was nominated for an Academy Award, followed a platoon of soldiers with whom Mr. Junger had embedded in Afghanistan. \u201cThe Last Patrol\u201d (2014) follows him, photojournalist       Guillermo Cervera       and two combat veterans as they talk about the challenges of re-entering normal life during a long hike from Washington, D.C., to Pennsylvania.Mr. Junger grew up in Belmont, Mass., the son of a mother who is a painter and a Jewish physicist father who fled to the U.S. from Europe at the beginning of World War II. He found the wealthy suburb cold and sterile. \u201cIt just felt like a bubble,\u201d he says.After graduating from Wesleyan University in 1984, he moved around and eventually landed in Gloucester, Mass. While working as a freelance writer, he found a side job as a climber for a tree company until a chain saw tore into his left leg, leaving him severely injured.During his recovery, an intense, three-day Nor\u2019easter hit the East Coast and sank a local boat, the Andrea Gail, killing its six-man crew. After doing some research, Mr. Junger thought that the storm, along with the dangers deep-sea fishermen face in their work, would make a compelling topic for a book.He wrote a proposal and found an agent to shop it around to publishing houses but assumed it wouldn\u2019t sell. So he went to Bosnia to become a freelance war reporter. \u201cWhen your plan B is to become a war reporter, you\u2019re facing the wrong direction,\u201d he says with a laugh. While he was there, his agent faxed him to let him know that the book had sold. \u201cThe Perfect Storm\u201d quickly became a best-seller and was the basis of the blockbuster film of the same name.Still, Mr. Junger continued working as a war reporter; he went to Kosovo as soon as he finished his book tour for \u201cThe Perfect Storm.\u201d He decided to stop reporting from the front lines after his friend       Tim Hetherington,        a war photographer who had co-directed \u201cRestrepo,\u201d died of a mortar wound while covering the civil war in Libya in 2011. \u201cIt\u2019s too dangerous,\u201d he says. \u201cI do miss it, but I don\u2019t want to go back to it.\u201dHe did not go to Syria for \u201cHell on Earth.\u201d His co-director, Nick Quested, went to border areas and made contacts in Syria from there. Mr. Junger thought it was important to document Islamic State\u2019s rise. \u201cIt seemed like a gnarly, tragic topic we should try to cover,\u201d he says.In his latest book, \u201cTribe,\u201d he looks at the human need for community. He came up with the idea for the book after wondering why he got depressed when he left Sarajevo for short breaks in the 1990s. He found that soldiers felt the same way when they left the battlefield, as did people who left cancer wards as survivors. They missed the community they had left. \u201cAll of a sudden, I got it,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s a theme here.\u201d What people instinctively want, he says, is to belong to small groups with a clear purpose.Too many of us are missing that sense of community and purpose in our increasingly isolated modern lives, he says. Technology and modern comforts give people too much time to think and wallow, he adds. \u201cWhen you have the free space to indulge in anxious rumination, your state of mind deteriorates,\u201d he says.To avoid distractions and try to be present in his daily life, Mr. Junger carries a flip phone so that he isn\u2019t tempted to check his email all day. He lives in a low-income, mostly Spanish-speaking neighborhood in New York City. \u201cIt\u2019s the exact opposite of the wealthy and desolate suburb I grew up in,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s something about that that feels real and human.\u201dHe also likes the sense of community in his neighborhood. How can others find something similar? It isn\u2019t easy, he says: \u201cI think we\u2019re doomed to a mild unhappiness.\u201dWrite to Alexandra Wolfe at alexandra.wolfe@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-16 13:49:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/sebastian-junger-focuses-on-syria-1497635357", "news_title": "Sebastian Junger Focuses on Syria", "keywords": " documentary films, hell on earth, isis, islamic state,sebastian junger, syria,the perfect storm,war reporting,Sebastian Junger,political,general news,national,public security,crime,legal action,arts,entertainment,movies,terrorism"}, {"content": "If you\u2019re the chief executive of a publicly traded company and want a raise, what should you do?(a) Keep breathing.(b) Get yourself on CNBC.The first answer will probably work, but getting some media attention will work better, especially if your company isn\u2019t too large and its stock has been doing well. Those are the key findings of a new study of CEO pay and U.S. media exposure conducted by a pair of American-trained business professors in Asia.Jingoo Kang of Singapore\u2019s Nanyang Technological University and Andy Y. Han Kim of Seoul\u2019s Sungkyunkwan University studied 4,452 CEOs at 2,666 U.S. firms from 1997 to 2009. They also took account of 104,129 news articles and 6,567 CNBC appearances featuring CEOs during that period. They found \u201cthat a CEO\u2019s appearance in CNBC interviews and major news articles has a positive relationship with his or her compensation in the following year, after controlling for firm performance and other confounding factors.\u201dDrs. Kang and Kim hypothesized that CEO media appearances would lead to higher pay; that the effect would be larger if the firm\u2019s shares rose during the fiscal year of the media attention; that CEOs of small firms would benefit more than those of large ones; and that the effect would be muted for founding CEOs or those holding large equity positions in their own firms.The evidence, the professors report, bore out all those assertions. Why? The study\u2019s authors point to visibility and competition for executive talent. Going on CNBC, in particular, raises a CEO\u2019s profile, and the effect is greatest for the least-known.       Mary Barra,        say, is already famous as the CEO of General Motors and unlikely to gain much additional renown from a TV hit.But for heads of smaller firms, a major TV appearance can put them on the radar for headhunters and competitors\u2014and help them to get more compensation from their current employers. When the study\u2019s authors looked at the 187 CEOs who voluntarily left for other firms in the same year or the following year after print media or CNBC exposure, they got similar results.How big is the CNBC effect? \u201cCEOs who appear in CNBC interviews will earn $210,239 more\u201d on average in the following year, the professors say, compared with similar CEOs who didn\u2019t go on. The effect for CEOs in the bottom quartile of firm size was $130,925 greater than for CEOs in the top quartile, even though big-company CEOs usually get paid more. Print coverage had less impact: A CEO who got 1% more print coverage than average in a year got .028 percentage points of extra compensation the next year.The professors say they recognized that CEOs go on CNBC voluntarily and some may push to get on air. CNBC may also be choosing CEOs who are doing a good job, which might motivate directors to raise a leader\u2019s compensation.The professors used statistical techniques to tease out other potential causes for the phenomenon and assess their individual impacts. The findings held up; when the researchers controlled for company performance, CEO tenure, gender, age and other factors, the role of media exposure in boosting CEO pay persisted.To ensure that the effect didn\u2019t result from media attention to a CEO\u2019s company rather than just to the boss, the researchers assessed the impact of news articles about the firm rather than those about the CEO. Articles about a company had no significant correlation with the following year\u2019s CEO pay.\u201cThe Relationship Between CEO Media Appearances and Compensation,\u201d Jingoo Kang and Andy Y.

Now, the bank is in the midst of a digital transformation that will let the U.S.\u2019s biggest brokerage by number of financial advisers embrace some of the country\u2019s smallest investors.\u201cThese robo-advisory solutions make sense for that segment of the market that has frankly been traditionally underserved,\u201d said       Naureen Hassan,        Morgan Stanley\u2019s chief digital officer for wealth management, while speaking at Morgan Stanley\u2019s financials conference earlier this week. \u201cBut as your needs get more complex...that\u2019s when you want a coach, and you want somebody that you can talk to and talk through that decision.\u201dMorgan Stanley told brokers on Thursday it would begin testing its robo service with a small group of employees in June, according to a person familiar with the matter.Similar to other robos, Morgan Stanley\u2019s automated-investing service relies on an algorithm to gauge an investor\u2019s appetite for risk and then recommends an appropriate portfolio of mutual funds and exchange-traded funds, according to the filing. The service, which will cost 0.45% of the invested assets annually, will also give investors the option to further customize their portfolios around certain themes, such as focusing on sustainable investments or other socially responsible investment themes.Morgan Stanley is gearing the service initially toward people it already has a relationship with, such as the children of current clients or people who participate in employee stock purchase plans administered by Morgan Stanley, Ms. Hassan said. There are some $30 billion in vested shares alone among 1.5 million corporate stock plan participants administered by Morgan Stanley, and they have an additional $500 billion in outside assets, she added.The robo service is also being viewed as an \u201casset incubator,\u201d say brokers familiar with the tool\u2019s development, meaning it can help brokers keep an eye on smaller investors who may eventually need more sophisticated advice as their portfolios grow. To encourage brokers to promote the service, Morgan Stanley will pay a referral fee, according to the SEC filing.Ms. Hassan said at the conference Morgan Stanley will do some targeted digital marketing to attract those new clients.The robo adviser is part of a broader digital upgrade within Morgan Stanley\u2019s more than $2 trillion wealth-management business. Relying on a mix of internal development and partnerships with digital companies, Morgan Stanley is focused on modernizing the capabilities of its nearly 600 wealth offices throughout the U.S. It hopes to enable brokers to better communicate with clients digitally, such as through texting and social media, and connect with a new generation of customers through digital advice.The service may also help Morgan Stanley\u2014and other brokerages that have been launching similar offerings\u2014better position themselves ahead of an estimated $30 trillion transfer in wealth from baby boomers to their heirs. The industry, which is grappling with an aging workforce that has been slow to change, has long struggled with retaining accounts that move from parents to children who grew up in the digital age.Researcher Cerulli Associates estimates the robo advice industry had more than $80 billion in assets by the end of 2016 and will have $385 billion in the next five years.And the country\u2019s big four brokerages aren\u2019t ignoring the potential growth. Merrill Lynch\u2019s parent,             Bank of America Corp.      , earlier this year launched its own automated investment advice service known as Merrill Edge Guided Solutions, which also charges a 0.45% fee and requires $5,000 to open an account.             Wells Fargo                   & Co. is in the midst of testing its own service, Intuitive Investor, which charges 0.50% and requires a minimum $10,000 investment, as is UBS Group AG.\u201cLaunching one of these robos has strategic value for firms with large sales forces,\u201d said       William Trout,        a brokerage and robo adviser analyst with Celent. \u201cThey can leverage their existing client bases.\u201dWrite to Michael Wursthorn at Michael.Wursthorn@wsj.comAppeared in the June 17, 2017, print edition as 'Morgan Stanley Joins Robo-Advisory Era.'", "news_time": "2017-06-16 13:44:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/morgan-stanley-aims-robo-service-at-next-generation-investors-1497635074", "news_title": "Morgan Stanley Aims Robo Service at Next-Generation Investors ", "keywords": "banking,brokers,filing,financial advisers,investors ,markets,morgan stanley,naureen hassan,portfolios,robo advice,securities regulations,wealth management,marketing,corporate,industrial news,customer relationship management,political,general news,fixed income investing,investment ideas,investor education,personal investments in bonds,personal investments in stocks,personal finance,personal investments,selection of top stories,trends,analysis,suggested reading   industry news,suggested reading \u2013 investing,securities,commercial banking,financial investments,investment banking,credit,financial services,investing,private banking"}, {"content": "A Massachusetts judge on Friday found a young woman criminally responsible for the suicide of her boyfriend who killed himself after she sent him numerous text messages strongly urging him to take his own life.Michelle Carter,        who was convicted of involuntary manslaughter, was miles away from 18-year-old       Conrad Roy III       when he sat in his truck in a parking lot inhaling carbon monoxide in 2014.A lawyer for Ms. Carter wasn\u2019t immediately available for comment Friday.The case against her wasn\u2019t the first in Massachusetts to wrestle with the culpability of encouraging someone to commit suicide. But this case was unusual in that the criminal conduct wasn\u2019t a physical act, like giving someone a gun, but consisted of words alone.Ms. Carter was 17 at the time when she sent numerous text messages to Mr. Roy telling him that he should take his life. \u201cIf u don\u2019t do it now you\u2019re never gonna do it,\u201d said one her texts quoted in court papers.In another exchange, she helped him figure out the method for doing it, using a portable generator to pump carbon monoxide into his truck. Evidence also emerged that she knew her boyfriend had been treated for mental illness and had previously attempted suicide.Television images from inside the courtroom in Taunton, Mass., showed Ms. Carter in tears as Bristol County Juvenile Court Judge Lawrence Moniz read his verdict. She faces up to 20 years behind bars.Ms. Carter\u2019s attorney had argued that her texts were protected by the First Amendment and that it was unreasonable to expect her to know that her conduct was prosecutable.Unlike some states, Massachusetts doesn\u2019t specifically make it a crime to encourage another person to commit suicide. The state defines involuntary manslaughter as the \u201cunlawful killing that was unintentionally caused as the result of the defendants\u2019 wanton or reckless conduct.\u201dLast year, the highest court in Massachusetts ruled that Ms. Carter should face trial. In its opinion, the court cited a case from the 1960s in which a man was convicted for giving his wife a loaded gun, knowing she had already attempted suicide twice.

Despite spending most of her career in France, she always thought of herself as American, and though never married or a mother, she produced supremely sensitive images of maternity and childhood. \u201cLittle Girl in a Blue Armchair\u201d is one of the finest examples of that.The painting is one of the most appealing works in the monumental collection of Paul and Bunny Mellon, now at the National Gallery of Art in Washington. In a further paradox, it presents a seemingly simple and charming situation but turns out to be a rather daring and complicated composition. While primarily her own work, it included the collaborative hand of her French colleague Edgar Degas.Cassatt was born in western Pennsylvania in 1844, the same year as the Philadelphian       Thomas Eakins.       Both enrolled in the art program at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts during the Civil War years and left concurrently for study in Paris in 1866. There, however, the Ecole des Beaux Arts was not yet open to women, so Cassatt had to take private art instruction. She became aware of the new realism of       Gustave Courbet       and the unconventional pictorial formats of       Edouard Manet       and       Gustave Caillebotte.       She returned home during the Franco-Prussian War, but in the early 1870s was back in Europe and traveled to Spain and Italy, where she admired respectively the art of       Velazquez       and Rubens.Degas became an acquaintance and, impressed, invited her to join the Impressionist group in 1877. The two shared ideas and compared pictures; they experimented with materials, technique and design. With \u201cLittle Girl\u201d under way by 1878, Degas offered advice, and as Cassatt wrote years later, \u201che even worked on the background.\u201d Pleased with the result and his involvement, she was surprised and angered to have the painting rejected for the Universal Exposition later that year. But it was accepted into the Impressionists\u2019 independent exhibition in 1879, and she continued to show with them regularly until 1886.The young girl in the picture was the daughter of friends of Degas. She slouches on the stuffed armchair, almost sliding forward off the cushion. The pose was similar to one used by a contemporary,       Alfred Cluysenear,        in his \u201cPortrait of the Artist\u2019s Son, Andre,\u201d but his was less original in spatial design. Cassatt shows the girl\u2019s legs splayed, revealing the lacy undergarment, in a hint of sexuality to come.While floral blues dominate the composition, the child\u2019s white pinafore stands out, in turn contrasted with the darker stripes of her tartan bandanna, scarf, socks and sash. This last serves almost as a wide seat belt holding her in place. The painter balances it with the similar dark shape of her dog sleeping on the adjacent chair at the left. Cassatt had tried placing the dog on the floor before the sofa but realized the figure brought more life to the foreground. The thoughtful glance and expensive dress reveal a young girl caught between childhood and maturity.Critics have long believed that the principal intervention by Degas in the picture was painting the empty floor surface in the center. This spatial vacuum was typical of his depictions of both street scenes and interior dance floors. Its neutral flatness exists in tension with the amplitude and color of the furniture compressed around it. In another modern device inspired by Degas, Cassatt cropped all four pieces of furniture in the room by the edges of the frame. Degas had done this in his painting of a song recital from about 1872-73. It creates an informality and almost photographic immediacy typical of the new vision promoted by Manet and Degas at this time.Daylight enters this room by the two large windows. The near one complements the white dress, while the other casts a soft abstract shadow on the far wall. More important, it establishes the back corner of the room, now ascertained to have been the reworking of the space by Degas. In 2014 conservators at the National Gallery undertook infrared imaging of the paint treatment in this area and found different applications of brushwork.Their studies further revealed that Cassatt\u2019s original floor line along the back wall was a horizontal running parallel to the frame. Degas appears to have altered that to create the strong back corner and the sense of the floor surface inclining upward to that point. He subtly helped her adjust the plane of the back wall to more of a diagonal, now coming forward behind the child. All this serves to create a visual dynamism as the eye circles around the blue shapes, and introduces a tension that balances solids and void, foreground and background.The painting reflects the mutual respect between these two major artists and inaugurated an independent career of original modernity.\u2014Mr. Wilmerding is the great-grandson of       Louisine Havemeyer,        a friend of Cassatt\u2019s, whom the artist advised in amassing the Impressionist collection now at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.", "news_time": "2017-06-16 13:07:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/when-two-hands-were-better-than-one-1497632858", "news_title": "When Two Hands Were Better Than One", "keywords": "arts in review, edgar degas, little girl in a blue armchair, mary cassatt,painting,Mary Cassatt,art,political,general news,arts,entertainment"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014The Trump administration reiterated that it would continue, at least for now, an Obama-era program that allows people brought to the U.S. illegally as children a reprieve from deportation and the chance to work legally.This has been the policy since President Donald Trump took office, and it was made official in a February memorandum implementing one of the president\u2019s executive orders on immigration. Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly has repeatedly told Congress and others that the new administration is retaining the so-called Dreamers program, and the administration has approved tens of thousands of new applications and renewals.Mr. Kelly said as much in a memorandum on a related subject issued late Thursday. \u201cThe June 15, 2012, memorandum that created the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program will remain in effect,\u201d he wrote.Still, administration officials said they could still change their minds. \u201cThere has been no final determination made about the DACA program, which the president has stressed needs to be handled with compassion and with heart,\u201d said Jonathan Hoffman, Department of Homeland Security assistant secretary for public affairs, in a statement.The Kelly memo, signed\u00a0Thursday, primarily concerns a related program that Mr. Obama tried to create but that never took effect: one that would offer the same protections from deportation for an estimated several million parents of children who are citizens or lawful permanent residents. That program, Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents, known as DAPA, was widely opposed by Republicans. Twenty-six states sued to stop it, and the initiative was blocked by the courts.There was never any indication that Mr. Trump might try to revive DAPA. But the\u00a0Thursday\u00a0memo made official that he was rescinding the Obama memorandum that created it. \u201cThere is no credible path forward to litigate the currently enjoined policy,\u201d Mr. Kelly wrote.The program was put on hold by a federal appeals court, and the Supreme Court then deadlocked 4-4 over the matter, ruling at a time when there was a vacancy on the nine-member court. That meant the lower court ruling blocking it stood.

Since the program began, nearly 800,000 people have been granted the protective status.There have been a handful of arrests of people enrolled in or eligible for DACA. The administration has typically said those people lost their status or became deportation priorities because of a criminal conviction, though the facts of some of these cases are in dispute.Supporters of a wider immigration overhaul that would give undocumented immigrants a permanent legal status were pleased by the reaffirmation of the program but said they hoped more would be done.\u201cIt is of some comfort that the [DACA] program, initiated five years ago, remains in place, but the need for Congress to pass comprehensive immigration reform with a pathway to citizenship has never been more urgent,\u201d said Rep.

Witch Hunt.\u201dMr. Trump didn\u2019t identify \u201cthe man\u201d referenced in the tweet, but the description most closely aligns with\u00a0Deputy Attorney General       Rod Rosenstein,        who was nominated to his post by Mr. Trump.\u00a0The president hasn\u2019t indicated if he had any direct knowledge that he was under investigation, beyond recent media reports.A White House spokeswoman referred questions to the president\u2019s outside counsel, Marc Kasowitz. A spokesman for Mr. Kasowitz didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.Last month, Mr. Rosenstein appointed former FBI director Robert Mueller III as special counsel to lead a wide-ranging investigation into Russian meddling in the presidential race and possible collusion between Trump campaign aides and Russia.The investigation\u2019s leadership has come under fire from Mr. Trump in recent days.Thursday, he tweeted: \u201cThey made up a phony collusion with the Russians story, found zero proof, so now they go for obstruction of justice on the phony story.\u201d He added: \u201cYou are witnessing the single greatest WITCH HUNT in American political history\u2014led by some very bad and conflicted people!\u201dIn neither tweet did he name who the people were.The Wall Street Journal and other news outlets reported earlier this week that Investigators are now looking into whether the president sought to obstruct the investigation, in part by firing FBI Director       James Comey       on May 9.The White House initially said Mr. Trump had fired Mr. Comey on the \u201cclear recommendations\u201d of both Mr. Rosenstein and Attorney General Jeff Sessions.\u00a0But the White House subsequently said Mr. Trump had already decided to fire Mr. Comey before he received those recommendations.\u00a0\u201cI was going to fire regardless,\u201d he said in an NBC News interview.In March, Mr. Sessions recused himself from the Russia probe, leaving Mr. Rosenstein to make the decision to appoint the special counsel.On Wednesday, the spokesman for Mr. Trump\u2019s personal lawyer denounced the revelation of the probe of Mr. Trump in a statement, and pointed the finger at the FBI.\u00a0\u201cThe FBI leak of information regarding the president is outrageous, inexcusable and illegal,\u201d the spokesman said at the time.Late Thursday night, Mr. Rosenstein issued a statement saying people should be wary of reported leaks, and of their source.\u201cAmericans should exercise caution before accepting as true any stories attributed to anonymous \u2019officials,\u2019 particularly when they do not identify the country\u2014let alone the branch or agency of government\u2014with which the alleged sources supposedly are affiliated,\u201d he said.Mr. Rosenstein\u2019s statement, and its timing, raised questions about what had prompted it. It came hours after The Washington Post, citing anonymous sources, said the special counsel\u2019s office was investigating the business dealings of Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law and adviser,       Jared Kushner.A Justice Department spokesman, asked if the White House had urged Mr. Rosenstein to issue the statement, said Friday, \u201cIt was Rod\u2019s statement and Rod\u2019s alone.\u201dJustice Department officials have expressed frustration in recent weeks at what they call inaccurate reports about Mr. Rosenstein, including that Mr. Comey had asked Mr. Rosenstein for additional resources for the Russia investigation and that Mr. Rosenstein threatened to quit amid the White House\u2019s shifting explanations for Mr. Comey\u2019s firing.Mr. Rosenstein\u2019s statement on anonymous sources prompted criticism from some of his former colleagues. Former Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara wrote on Twitter, \u201cwhere is Rod Rosenstein\u2019s overdue statement responding to the President\u2019s repeated attacks on his appointment of Robert Mueller?\u201dAdvisers to Mr. Trump have urged him not to tweet about the Russia investigation, cautioning that his 140-character notes could provide fodder for Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation.Some White House officials want no one in the building to talk about the Russia probe\u2014from the president on down. They have tried to outsource the matter entirely to Mr. Kasowitz and keep the White House focused on the president\u2019s policy agenda.Peter Wehner, who served as an official in the Republican administrations of Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush and       George W. Bush,        said in an interview that Mr. Trump\u2019s tweets about the Russia investigation are \u201cextremely damaging to him.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s an indication of what a disordered mind he has that he continues to do this, because on some level he has to know this is harmful to him.

XPO -1.16%       is kicking the tires on potential targets in Europe and North America, chief executive       Bradley Jacobs       told a supply-chain management conference in Chicago.This time around, the focus is largely on companies that would bolster XPO\u2019s existing business lines, particularly in contract logistics, rather than adding new services.\u201cWe\u2019re looking at deals that are mostly over $500 million of Ebitda, with a few exceptions,\u201d Mr. Jacobs said Thursday. \u201cSome of them are smaller, because they\u2019re strategic, but by and large, we\u2019re looking at the larger deals where we can apply the skills that we\u2019ve honed as a team to integrate, to optimize and get the synergy.\u201dThe Greenwich, Conn., company has rolled up more than a dozen logistics businesses over the past five years, including trucking companies, freight brokers and last-mile delivery specialists, in an acquisitions spree aimed at transforming XPO into an end-to-end global supply-chain provider.XPO\u2019s customers include large retailers with growing e-commerce sales, such as IKEA and Inditex SA\u2019s Zara, as well as big-box and online retailers that rely on the company to manage warehouses and deliver items to consumers\u2019 homes.The buying binge reached a peak in 2015 when XPO bought French transportation and logistics firm             Norbert Dentressangle SA       for $3.5 billion and a few months later purchased U.S. trucking companyCon-way Inc. for $3 billion. The pace and scale of the acquisitions raised concerns among some investors over XPO\u2019s ability to digest such large acquisitions.\u201cThe whole business model is very aggressive moves,\u201d said Lee Clair, an industry analyst with Transportation and Logistics Advisors, LLC. \u201cOn the one hand you\u2019d say it\u2019s very high risk\u2026but they\u2019ve done a great job up to this point.\u201dSince those two big acquisitions, XPO has been in integration mode, reducing its debt and focusing on cost-savings and operational improvements. It sold the truckload portion of the former Con-way business last year, and has reported four consecutive quarterly profits.\u00a0XPO reported $19.5 million in net income, and $3.54 billion in revenue in this year\u2019s first quarter, and operating income in its less-than-truckload unit jumped 49% year-over-year.The company\u2019s shares were trading at $60.85 at midday Friday, off 0.34% from Thursday\u2019s close, but have more than doubled from a year ago, when they traded at $26.98.Mr. Jacobs is \u201ca big force who\u2019s been out of the market\u2026because he had such a lot of wood to chop on Con-way,\u201d said Citi analyst Christian Wetherbee. XPO\u2019s organic growth has accelerated during that period, he said, with the company \u201cbecoming more of a one-stop shop for his biggest customers, so he wants something that he can cross-sell.\u201dWhich companies XPO might target, and when, is unclear.\u201cIt\u2019s just in the early, early stages,\u201d Mr. Jacobs said at the conference.Global mergers-and-acquisition activity in the transportation and logistics sector has slowed since 2015.

The long-running dispute has gained new relevance as the Trump administration tries to implement and enforce a stricter immigration policy.Research published a decade after the Mariel boatlift, as well as more recent analyses, concluded that the influx of Cuban migrants didn\u2019t significantly raise unemployment or lower wages for Miamians. Immigration advocates said the episode showed that the U.S. labor market could quickly absorb migrants at little cost to American workers.But Harvard University\u2019s       George Borjas,        a Cuban-born specialist in immigration economics, reached very different conclusions. Looking at data for Miami after the boatlift, he concluded that the arrival of the Marielitos led to a large decline in wages for low-skilled local workers.While the debate rages in the academy and online, Dr. Borjas and his views are ascendant in the political realm. Attorney General       Jeff Sessions       cited his research for years while a senator. President Donald Trump, with whom Dr. Borjas met during last year\u2019s campaign, has echoed the Harvard economist\u2019s research by regularly saying that low-wage immigrants hurt some Americans.\u201cThis is his moment,\u201d said       David Card,        the author of the early research on the boatlift that Dr. Borjas is seeking to upend. (The Justice Department declined to comment, and the White House didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.)Dr. Borjas has sparred for years with Dr. Card, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley, as well as with       Giovanni Peri       of the University of California, Davis. In 2015, Dr. Borjas and Dr. Peri released papers three months apart that arrived at wildly different conclusions about Mariel.The argument among the academics\u2014all immigrants themselves\u2014has escalated into charges of bias and bad faith. Dr. Peri and a co-author dismissed Dr. Borjas\u2019s study as having \u201cserious limitations.\u201d Dr. Borjas fired back that \u201csloppiness\u201d in their own paper \u201chelps obfuscate what your eyes can clearly see and leads to a claim that nothing at all happened in post-Mariel Miami.\u201dDr. Card and Dr. Peri, reviewing a textbook by Dr. Borjas several months later, said that he only \u201cpresents half the story about the economics of immigration.\u201d Last fall, in another book, Dr. Borjas compared Dr. Peri to Marxist-Leninist teachers in his native Cuba: \u201cThey believed. All that was left was to compel everyone else to believe as well.\u201dThe real-world stakes in the dispute are considerable. More than 43 million U.S. residents were born somewhere else, and most of the rest are descended from immigrants. Still, for more than two centuries, waves of migration have provoked backlashes from Americans worried about the nation\u2019s economy, culture and social makeup.Among economists today, there is little controversy about the benefits of immigration for the economy as a whole. A roughly 500-page assessment last year by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, which reviewed decades of research, concluded that immigrants are \u201cintegral to the nation\u2019s economic growth\u201d and have little or no effect on overall employment and earnings for workers already in the U.S.The report said that experiences aren\u2019t the same for everyone and noted that some studies have found \u201csizable negative short run wage impacts\u201d for U.S.-born high-school dropouts, the group most likely to compete for work with low-skilled immigrants.\u201cThere\u2019s no free lunch. There\u2019s going to be some effect of immigration\u201d on wages, said       Pia Orrenius,        a senior economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas and a member of the panel that wrote the 2016 report. But, she added, the flexible U.S. economy adapts and should render any hit to the wages of native workers \u201ca short-run phenomenon.\u201dThose most exposed to competition from new arrivals have long been a focus for Dr. Borjas. \u201cImmigration is not like manna from heaven,\u201d he said. \u201cIt can be great on average, but it doesn\u2019t mean that every single person benefits.\u201dWhen he set out a few years ago to write a new book on immigration for a general audience, even some of his friends and family struggled with his draft chapter on the labor market. He says that his \u201cvery mathematical\u201d analysis was correct but difficult for nonspecialists because \u201cit doesn\u2019t tell a story.\u201dIn immigration economics, few stories are more compelling than that of the Mariel boatlift. In April 1980,       Fidel Castro       announced that Cubans would be allowed to leave the country from Mariel. Privately owned boats began to shuttle across the Florida Straits, some overloaded with refugees. By the time the boatlift ended in late September, more than 1% of the island\u2019s population had left for new lives in the U.S. Many of them remained in the Miami area, expanding the local workforce more or less overnight.Economists refer to such an episode as a \u201cnatural experiment\u201d\u2014a situation involving a sudden and dramatic change, thus helping researchers to identify cause-and-effect relationships. In ordinary circumstances, such relationships can be hard to untangle from multiple forces and trends developing over time.The Mariel boatlift is among several such episodes that labor economists have studied for insight into immigration\u2019s pluses and minuses. Others include the exodus of French Algerians to France in the 1960s and the arrival of Soviet Jews in Israel in the 1990s.\u2018Sometimes, the world conducts an experiment for us.\u2019\u201cIdeally, we would have a laboratory and conduct our own experiments. We can\u2019t do that,\u201d said       Francine Blau,        a Cornell University economist who led the National Academies\u2019 broad review of research on immigration. \u201cBut sometimes, the world conducts an experiment for us.\u201dStill, researchers urge caution in generalizing from such natural experiments. A sudden wave of refugees, as in the Mariel case, isn\u2019t the same thing as a steady trickle of immigrants over time. \u201cEat a gallon of salt, and it will kill you,\u201d said       Michael Clemens,        a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development in Washington. \u201cBut that just does not help people trying to decide how much salt to put on their food.\u201dDr. Card, who is from Canada, kicked off the debate over Mariel in 1990 with a paper comparing Miami with four similar U.S. cities that hadn\u2019t absorbed a wave of refugees. His conclusion: \u201cThe Mariel immigration had essentially no effect on the wages or employment outcomes of non-Cuban workers in the Miami labor market.\u201d The study upended a simple supply-and-demand view of immigration, and decades later, it remains widely cited among economists.Dr. Borjas, who left Cuba in 1962, when he was 12 years old, has long challenged the idea that immigration has few downsides. One of his studies in the early 2000s analyzed decades of national data to conclude that immigrants generally do push down wages for native workers, particularly high-school dropouts.One Sunday morning in 2015, while working on his book, Dr. Borjas recalls, he decided to revisit the Mariel boatlift. He focused on U.S.-born high-school dropouts and applied more sophisticated analytical methods than had been available to Dr. Card a quarter-century earlier.Dr. Borjas found a steep decline in wages for low-skilled workers in Miami in the years after the boatlift\u2014in the range of 10% to 30%. \u201cEven the most cursory reexamination of some old data with some new ideas can reveal trends that radically change what we think we know,\u201d he wrote in his initial September 2015 paper.Within a few months, Dr. Peri, who is from Italy, and Vasil Yasenov, then a University of California, Davis, graduate student, released their own paper. Using methods similar to Dr. Borjas\u2019s to analyze the boatlift, they confirmed Dr. Card\u2019s finding that the Cuban influx had no significant effect on wages of the native-born in Miami, even low-skilled workers.What explains the divergence? In large part, technical decisions about which subset of survey data to analyze and which Miami workers to put under the microscope.Dr. Borjas said that Dr. Peri examined too broad a sample, diluting the Marielitos\u2019 effect by including women and high-school students among the U.S.-born workers in his analysis. Dr. Peri is \u201ca good economist, but he cuts corners,\u201d Dr. Borjas said.Dr. Peri revised his paper in response to the criticisms and said that his results still held up. He added that Dr. Borjas was too eager to draw conclusions from extremely small samples of male, non-Hispanic, high-school dropouts in Miami\u2014amounting to fewer than two dozen people in most years of survey data. \u201cWe all know it is crazy to try to say what happened to wages in a city based only on 20 people,\u201d Dr. Peri said. \u201cThe measurement error is such that it essentially swamps anything else.\u201dDr. Borjas said that he combined several years of data to get larger samples and still found the decline in native-worker wages to be statistically significant.Economists on both sides of the divide acknowledge the difficulty of reaching definitive conclusions from the Mariel story about how immigration affects wages in general, given the boatlift\u2019s unique nature and the limitations of available data.But that hasn\u2019t prevented years of argument. The heated academic dispute \u201cperhaps mirrors the broader public debate\u2014people tend to have very strong feelings about immigration,\u201d said       Ethan Lewis,        a Dartmouth College economist who also has studied the boatlift.The economic establishment largely sides with the Card-Peri camp on the Mariel boatlift. Several top economists said in interviews that they found Dr. Borjas\u2019s findings less compelling.Jennifer Hunt of Rutgers University, who served on the National Academies panel that studied immigration last year, and Dr. Clemens of the Center for Global Development released a new analysis in May that dismissed Dr. Borjas\u2019s finding as the result of quirks in underlying survey data. In turn, Dr. Borjas rejected their conclusion, calling it \u201cfake news.\u201dDr. Borjas has spent decades swimming against the tide in his profession by focusing on immigration\u2019s costs rather than its benefits. He said that he sees a parallel to the way many economists look at international trade. Long seen as a positive force for growth, trade is now drawing attention from some economists looking for its ill effects on factory towns. \u201cI don\u2019t know why the profession has this huge lag and this emphasis on the benefits from globalization in general without looking at the other side,\u201d Dr. Borjas said.Those who see immigration as a boon have long cited Dr. Card\u2019s 1990 paper on the Mariel influx. \u201cIt was a 7% increase in Miami\u2019s workforce, and the evidence was it didn\u2019t take jobs away from Americans and it didn\u2019t lower their wages,\u201d said       Jason Furman,        who chaired the Council of Economic Advisers under President       Barack Obama,        in a 2014 briefing.Dr. Borjas\u2019s research, including his recent work on Mariel, has found fans on the other side of the debate. When he testified at a Senate hearing in March 2016, then-Sen. Sessions welcomed his rebuttal to Dr. Card\u2019s paper. \u201cThat study, I could never understand it because it goes against common sense of [the] free market: greater supply, lower costs,\u201d Mr. Sessions said. \u201cThat\u2019s just the way the world works.\u201dNow Mr. Sessions is a top policy maker, and the White House is pushing to curb both legal and illegal immigration. In his February speech to Congress, Mr. Trump called for lawmakers to limit low-skilled immigration in favor of merit-based entry, saying, \u201cThe current, outdated system depresses wages for our poorest workers.\u201dIn April, Mr. Trump signed an order requiring the executive branch \u201cto rigorously enforce and administer the laws governing entry into the United States of workers from abroad.\u201d The goal, he told an audience in Wisconsin, was to \u201cprotect jobs and wages of workers in the United States.\u201dDr. Borjas welcomes what he calls a more realistic approach to immigration under the Trump administration. \u201cIf you knew what the options are, who gets hurt and who wins by each of these options, you can make a much more intelligent decision rather than relying on wishful thinking,\u201d he said. \u201cWhich is what a lot of immigration, trade debates tend to be about\u2014that somehow this will all work out, and everybody will be happy.\u201dThe 1980 Mariel boatlift isn\u2019t the only event that economists have scrutinized for clues about how immigration affects the job prospects of native-born workers. Here are five other \u201cnatural experiments\u201d from recent world history that they have examined. In several of these cases, studies found temporary wage or employment declines for native workers after waves of mass immigration, but much research concludes that immigrants bring broad long-term economic benefits as well.Pieds NoirsAfter Algeria won its independence from French rule in 1962, some 900,000 members of the French settler population abruptly decamped to France. In 1992, the economist Jennifer Hunt (now at Rutgers University) published a study of how France\u2019s labor market reacted to the influx. She found that the repatriated French \u201chad little impact on the unemployment of others,\u201d alongside \u201conly weak evidence that the repatriates exerted downward pressure on wages.\u201dBracerosIn 1964, the U.S. ended its so-called bracero program, which admitted hundreds of thousands of Mexicans each year for seasonal farm labor, saying that it hurt native workers. But U.S. farmers didn\u2019t react to the labor shortage by hiring American laborers at higher wages, according to a recent National Bureau of Economic Research working paper by Michael Clemens, Ethan Lewis and Hannah Postel. Instead, the researchers found, farmers made \u201clarge changes in technology adoption and crop production,\u201d such as the use of labor-saving tomato-harvesting machines.RetornadosIn the mid-1970s, after the former Portuguese colonies Angola and Mozambique became independent, an estimated 600,000 refugees rushed to Portugal, increasing the size of its labor force by about 10% in only three years. A 1996 study by the economists William Carrington and Pedro de Lima found that regions that attracted many migrants saw \u201cmuch slower wage growth\u201d over the next decade, compared with other areas. But they added a caveat: A cross-country analysis found that while Portuguese unemployment seemed to have undergone an immigration-related increase, it was more modest than the broader Europe-wide economic forces that had pushed up unemployment across the region during this period.Soviet JewsIsrael\u2019s population swelled in the early 1990s as hundreds of thousands of Jews emigrated from the crumbling Soviet Union. In a 2001 article, the Brown University economist Rachel Friedberg wrote that her findings \u201cdo not support the view that immigrants adversely affect the earnings and employment opportunities\u201d of Israeli workers. A decade later, a study by Sarit Cohen-Goldner and M. Daniele Paserman found that the arrival of highly skilled Russian workers had briefly pushed down native Israelis\u2019 wages, but the effect faded after several years.Syrian RefugeesSince Syria plunged into civil war in 2011, millions of refugees have fled to neighboring countries, including Turkey. A 2017 working paper by four economists at the Turkish central bank concluded that the influx of Syrian refugees reduced employment among native workers, many of whom became unemployed or left the workforce entirely. The researchers speculated that the \u201cprevalence of informal employment\u201d in Turkey allowed refugees without work permits to displace native Turkish workers.Appeared in the June 17, 2017, print edition as 'The immigrationExperiment.'", "news_time": "2017-06-16 12:27:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-great-mariel-boatlift-experiment-1497630468", "news_title": "The Great Mariel Boatlift Debate: Does Immigration Lower Wages?", "keywords": "cuba,david card,donald trump,george borjas,giovanni peri,immigration,jeff sessions,mariel,mariel boatlift,wages,David Card,Giovanni Peri,George Borjas,labor,personnel,corporate,industrial news,labor disputes,workers pay,political,general news,crime,legal action,illegal immigration,migration,politics,international relations"}, {"content": "The International Olympic Committee said it and fast-food giant             McDonald\u2019s Corp.

For the struggling grocery industry, it is the biggest shift in a century.Amazon.com already sells groceries, of course, along with nearly everything else, but skeptics have pointed out that supermarkets are one business that may be largely safe from its mushrooming retail empire. Today\u2019s deal may prove the skeptics wrong.Whole Foods will give Amazon a much bigger footprint in the food business. In addition to over 460 stores, Amazon also will be getting the high-end grocer\u2019s distribution chain. That will allow its food delivery service, which is so far limited to only a handful of cities, to rapidly enter multiple markets.Moreover, Whole Foods is concentrated in the richer, higher-density markets where delivery makes the most sense. A quick glance at its store locations shows this. It has 28 stores in health-conscious Colorado and Connecticut combined. Kentucky and Alabama, with an almost identical population but lower incomes, education levels and population density, have six stores combined, one each in their major urban centers.That could give it a leg-up on other food-delivery ventures such as Royal Ahold Delhaize\u2019s Peapod and venture-backed Blue Apron Holdings. The cachet of the Whole Foods name\u2014it was named most-admired food and drugstore by Fortune last year\u2014could also make it a formidable competitor in the delivery business.Whole Foods also operates at much higher profit margins than other grocers, thanks in part to the higher markups it gets for many of its upscale items. It has a gross profit margin of 34%, which compares to 21% for         Kroger Co.       If Amazon\u2019s tolerance for lower profit margins in its retail business translates into its grocery venture, it could rapidly compress profitability in the sector.Amazon\u2019s timing for the deal appears impeccable. Its $42 a share offer represents a modest 27% premium to Whole Foods\u2019s closing price on Thursday and just 18% to its closing price a day earlier. The entire grocery sector had sold off in the wake of a plunge in Kroger shares following a profit warning.Even with the deal premium, Amazon\u2019s $13.7 billion price tag including debt compares to a debt-adjusted market value of $23 billion for Whole Foods less than four years ago when it had a fifth fewer stores.And, while it seems somewhat surprising that Amazon is paying cash rather than some combination of shares and cash despite having one of the best-performing large-company stocks in recent years, it is more likely to make the deal accretive to earnings per share. The price represents less than 3% of Amazon\u2019s own market value. Indeed, the rebound in Amazon\u2019s stock price as it began trading shortly after the news broke added as much market value as the purchase price.Get financial insights and commentary on global investing from The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Heard on the Street team.

Global alcohol volumes across all types fell 1.4%, a steeper decline than the average 0.3% drop over the past five years, according to industry tracker IWSR. Beer volumes fell 1.8% around the world in 2016, while wine sales slipped 0.08%. Yet sales of hard alcohol like gin, tequila and whiskey eked out an increase of 0.04%, and mixed drinks, including pre-mixed cocktails and some flavored alcoholic beverages, grew by 1.6%.The numbers underscore a shift in consumer tastes away from beer and wine and toward drinks that typically pack a higher percentage of alcohol, though intended to be consumed in less volume.Spirits are growing faster in the U.S. They were up 2.6% last year, in line with the five-year average and more than double wine-sales 2016 growth. Overall alcohol sales in the U.S. inched up 0.1% by volume.Consumption in 2016, change from a year earlierThe growth has been helped by liquor makers\u2019 efforts in recent years to attract new drinkers.

Spirits makers, he said, are benefiting from the revival in cocktail culture.Liquor ads, after years of restrictions, have crept back onto TV screens in recent years. The National Football League, a holdout until recently, plans to accept commercials for distilled spirits in the coming 2017 season. Spirits have also benefited from what executives describe as more fickle consumption habits by millennial drinkers, who tend to sip on a range of different beverages.Spirits tend to retail at higher prices than wine and beer, providing a bit of a cushion for the alcohol industry as a whole. Despite falling volumes last year, the dollar value of alcoholic drinks sold globally grew 4.7%, according to Euromonitor.

Factors based on student outcomes, which earlier included loan-repayment rates, account for 40% of the overall ranking.In the revised 2016 WSJ/THE ranking, Harvard University moved up to the second spot, from sixth, while the Massachusetts Institute of Technology now lands in third, rather than second. The California Institute of Technology fell out of the top 10, now standing at No. 12.Meanwhile, Tulane University jumped by 19 spots to No. 56. Bates College, Mount Holyoke College and Washington and Lee University cracked the top 90 by the new calculation. Howard University, the University of Denver and Occidental College fell from that bracket.The revised methodology, taking out debt repayment, also greatly affected the WSJ/THE ranking for outcomes. That list still looks at academic reputation, graduation rates, and the value colleges add to graduate salaries.On outcomes, Stanford slid to sixth place from second, and Yale University now ties at sixth after earlier taking the top spot. The University of Pennsylvania is now tied at the top, up from ninth place.Loan-repayment rates remain a valuable tool in assessing a college\u2019s quality and ability to help launch students into fulfilling and financially viable careers, says       Phil Baty,        editorial director for global rankings at Times Higher Education. \u201cWe\u2019re keen to include it.

The dispute pits the right of an internet poster to remain anonymous against the government\u2019s interests in finding potential witnesses to a crime.Glassdoor, founded in 2007, is a jobs-and-recruitment marketplace that offers a forum for users to critique their workplace, giving job seekers a view from the inside of their prospective employers.The confrontation began in early March, when federal prosecutors in Arizona sent Glassdoor a grand jury subpoena seeking the names and IP addresses of users who had posted comments about TriWest Healthcare Alliance, a Phoenix-based company that administers veterans health-care programs.The government contends it has no other way to identify employees who might have useful insights into TriWest\u2019s business practices.Glassdoor says the government\u2019s interests don\u2019t justify an \u201cinfringement on the First Amendment right of Glassdoor\u2019s users to speak anonymously\u201d that could discourage other reviewers and readers from using the site.TriWest\u2019s name is redacted from the court documents, but the filings contain enough information to identify the contractor. The investigation is looking at possible wire fraud and misuse of government funds, according to court documents.Elaine Labedz, vice president of communications for TriWest, said the company hasn\u2019t been contacted by government investigators and declined to comment on \u201canonymous postings on social media.\u201dCosme Lopez, a spokesman for acting U.S. Attorney Elizabeth Strange in Arizona, declined to comment on the nature of the investigation or its target. \u201cOur investigation is at the early stages,\u201d he said.With the subpoena, prosecutors sought to identify and speak with a handful of employees who posted comments about the contractor, describing them in court documents as \u201cwitnesses to potential unlawful conduct.\u201dOutside lawyers retained by Glassdoor said the company still wouldn\u2019t turn over the information and filed a motion in Arizona federal court to quash the subpoena.They argue in court papers that the government lacks a compelling need to identify the users. Revealing them, company lawyers said, \u201cmay have a broader chilling effect on protected expression.\u201dProsecutors characterize the information sought as \u201capolitical\u201d commercial speech that doesn\u2019t warrant special First Amendment protection.In court papers, the Justice Department compared Glassdoor to a news outlet resisting disclosure of the identity of a confidential source. In both cases, prosecutors argued, there is limited First Amendment protection. The government cited a landmark Supreme Court ruling from 1972 that held that the First Amendment \u201cdoes not relieve a newspaper reporter of the obligation\u2026to respond to a grand jury subpoena.\u201dU.S. District Judge Diane Humetewa of Arizona agreed with the government.\u201cGlassdoor\u2019s users are not a political association,\u201d Judge Humetewa wrote in an opinion issued in May and unsealed Monday. \u201cGlassdoor, like any newsman asserting a privilege on behalf of its sources, must respond to the grand jury subpoena,\u201d she said.Glassdoor has appealed her ruling to the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco, where the case will be briefed and argued.In a statement, Glassdoor objected to the judge\u2019s First Amendment analysis, calling an individual\u2019s right to anonymous speech \u201ca cornerstone of our society that inherently helps others and should be protected.\u201dAmerican University law professor Jennifer Daskal, who writes on issues related to privacy and criminal law, called the law around the government\u2019s ability to lift the veil on anonymous online speech \u201cpretty unresolved.\u201dShe said the case is about the right of \u201cpeople to speak anonymously on a range of a different websites without running the risk of revealing their identity to the government.\u201dGlassdoor has successfully challenged attempts by private plaintiffs to unmask the identities of anonymous reviewers in connection with defamation lawsuits. Courts held that the First Amendment concerns, or a lack of merit in the lawsuits, weighed in favor of protecting the reviewers\u2019 identities.The court documents contain few details about the investigation of TriWest. Prosecutors said in a legal brief that they wanted to speak with employees about \u201cpractices that maximize profit numbers.\u201dThe court filings contain a snippet of a Glassdoor review posted on Nov. 30, 2015, in which an employee of the contractor wrote that \u201call they care about is numbers.\u201dThe Wall Street Journal located comments by a TriWest employee published on Glassdoor on that same date. \u201cEverything is supposedly \u2018for the Veterans\u2019 but all they care about is numbers,\u201d the reviewer wrote.The Department of Veterans Affairs awarded contracts valued at more than $4 billion to TriWest in 2013 and 2014 to administer programs that connect veterans to medical services outside the VA system, helping them avoid long wait times or having to travel long distances.Congress authorized the $10 billion Veterans Choice Program after reports surfaced of veterans dying while waiting for medical care. President       Donald Trump       signed a law extending the program in April.The Veteran Affairs Office of the Inspector General wrote in a January report that the program had done little to reduce wait times and was difficult for veterans to navigate.Ms. Labedz, the TriWest spokeswoman, said the inspector general report was \u201coutdated.\u201d The company has scheduled more than two million first-time appointments for veterans, with an average wait time of 13 days, she said.", "news_time": "2017-06-16 11:05:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/online-reviewers-face-feds-over-right-to-stay-anonymous-1497625502", "news_title": "Online Reviewers Face Feds Over Right to Stay Anonymous ", "keywords": "first amendment,glassdoor,online commenters,online reviewers,triwest,va,veterans affairs,corporate crime,legal action,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,crime,health care,life sciences"}, {"content": "A closely watched gauge of U.S. consumer sentiment dropped in early June, a sign that political tensions in Washington may be denting Americans\u2019 confidence in the economy.The University of Michigan on Friday said its preliminary June reading on consumer sentiment was 94.5, its lowest level since November and down from May\u2019s final figure of 97.1. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected a preliminary June reading of 97.0; the index was still up 1.1% in June from a year earlier.The report \u201csuggests softening in consumer enthusiasm, although we expect that sentiment at these levels will still be supportive of consumer spending in the coming months,\u201d Barclays economist Blerina Uruci said in a note to clients.The survey\u2019s chief economist, Richard Curtin, said sentiment fell in response since June 8, the day former FBI director       James Comey       testified before Congress about events surrounding his firing last month by President       Donald Trump.       Mr. Curtin noted, however, that \u201conly a few consumers spontaneously referred to him or his testimony when asked to explain their views.\u201dThe Michigan sentiment survey in recent months has found a sharp partisan divide between pessimistic Democrats and optimistic Republicans. The post-June 8 drop in sentiment was largest among self-described independents, followed by Republicans, while Democrats saw a less-dramatic decline, according to Mr. Curtin.\u201cThis marks the first evidence that political turmoil in Washington could impinge on the economy, so gauges of consumer attitudes clearly bear watching,\u201d Amherst Pierpont Securities chief economist       Stephen Stanley       said in a note to clients.The index tracking consumer opinions about current economic conditions fell to 109.6 in June from 111.7 in May. The index tracking expectations about the future dipped to 84.7 from last month\u2019s 87.7.\u201cThe recent erosion of confidence was due to more negative perceptions of the proposed economic policies among Democrats and the reduced likelihood of passage of these policies among Republicans,\u201d Mr. Curtin said.Measures of U.S. consumer, business and investor sentiment all rose following last year\u2019s presidential election, though stronger sentiment failed to deliver strong household spending over the winter months. Still, growth in consumer outlays and overall economic activity appeared to pick up in the second quarter.\u201cHousehold spending, which was particularly soft earlier this year, has been supported by solid fundamentals, including ongoing improvement in the job market and relatively high levels of consumer sentiment and wealth,\u201d Federal Reserve Chairwoman       Janet Yellen      said Wednesday.Friday\u2019s report also showed that household expectations about future inflation firmed this month. In June, consumers said they expected 2.6% inflation in five to 10 years, up from 2.4% the prior three months. The expectation for inflation over the next year was unchanged at 2.6%.The Fed aims for 2% annual inflation, as measured by the Commerce Department\u2019s personal-consumption expenditures price index. The PCE price index in April was up 1.7% on the year, and prices excluding food and energy rose 1.5% from April 2016.\u201cThe recent lower readings on inflation have been driven significantly by what appears to be one-off reductions in certain categories of prices, such as wireless telephone services and prescription drugs,\u201d Ms. Yellen said this week.She said the Fed still expected inflation to move higher \u201cwith employment near its maximum sustainable level and the labor market continuing to strengthen.\u201dWrite to Ben Leubsdorf at ben.leubsdorf@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-16 11:02:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-consumer-sentiment-declined-in-early-june-1497622592", "news_title": "U.S. Consumer Sentiment Declined in Early June", "keywords": " consumer expectations, consumer sentiment, inflation expectations, u.s. economic expansion,university of michigan sentiment,University of Michigan,economic performance,indicators,inflation,prices,consumer sentiment,economic news"}, {"content": "A quarter-century after the Cold War ended, U.S. and Russian tank formations are once again squaring off.This spring, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization moved armored forces to the Russian border, where they are conducting daily drills from Poland to Estonia.

Both began their careers as junior armor officers at the height of the Cold War. Both were tested in irregular warfare against separatists and militant groups. Both have coped with the rise of disruptive battlefield technologies including drones, precision bombs and sophisticated new forms of propaganda.They haven\u2019t ever met. But each\u2014like Patton and Rommel or John Le Carr\u00e9\u2019s fictional Smiley and Karla\u2014has made a career of studying his opponent\u2019s moves.Their dynamic sheds light on the evolving military competition between the world\u2019s two biggest nuclear powers at a time of rising diplomatic tension. Moscow has narrowed a yawning gap in the quality of its conventional forces, but the U.S. remains far more powerful in that category. It is this imbalance that has shaped the strategic thinking of the two generals. It\u2019s American force and resolve against Russian cunning and diversion.Gen. McMaster, now President       Donald Trump\u2019s       national security adviser, has emphasized that America\u2019s true strength lies not in shadowy commando raids or pinprick drone strikes, but in well-equipped land, air and naval forces working together to clearly demonstrate overwhelming superiority.Military officers who know Gen. McMaster said they believe he will help shape the Trump administration strategy and influence the Pentagon\u2019s spending. Already the administration, which has been critical of allied defense budgets, has proposed a 40% increase in U.S. military spending in Europe, money that will pay for additional forces\u2014from Army helicopters to Navy sub-hunters\u2014to deploy there.Gen. McMaster was a hero of the first Gulf War\u2019s most important tank battle. He later honed his reputation in Iraq, implementing one of the first counterinsurgency campaigns in the city of Tal Afar, which later became a model for the 2007 troop surge. More recently Gen. McMaster has overseen two critical Army initiatives to prepare America for wars of the future and counter Russia\u2019s military advances.Gen. Gerasimov, by contrast, has always looked for American weaknesses and how Russian prowess can overcome American power. The chief of Russia\u2019s General Staff, he has been the most articulate proponent of Russia\u2019s emerging vision of conflict, something Western observers dub \u201chybrid warfare.\u201d In conflicts in Syria and Ukraine, he has pioneered new approaches to hybrid war by combining traditional military weaponry with powerful nonlethal tools such as cyberwarfare, fake news and elaborate deception.Both men obtained outsize reputations as military thinkers, lauded for their studies of the other side\u2019s strategy and tactics. Each was assigned by his military to predict the contours of future conflict. Perhaps more than anyone else on either side, the two men have delineated the strategy now playing out in Europe.Gen. McMaster, who declined to speak for this article, in essence rejected prevailing wisdom that viewed the Taliban\u2019s toppling in Afghanistan by U.S. special-operation forces as the future of warfare. Instead he focused on the Cold War, when conflict was avoided by ensuring adversaries understood America\u2019s conventional might. That means honing force-on-force war-fighting skills that had been neglected at the Army\u2019s main training ranges.\u201cThis is one officer who has done his homework over the years,\u201d said retired Army Gen. B.B. Bell, a former senior military commander in Europe and Korea. \u201cH.R. spent the last couple years pointing the path forward for the Army to put it on a strong path to relearn the capacities it must have to defend the nation.\u201dGen. McMaster is the author of a secret study compiling lessons of Russia\u2019s strategies in Ukraine. The work, according to officials, drew on front-line reports by Ukrainian troops and U.S. officers, analyzing how Moscow used advanced jamming techniques, electronic surveillance and drones to make its artillery more lethal than ever. Army officials say the research is continuing and the report remains classified.He has also influenced a generation of officers\u2014including those serving on NATO front lines in the Baltics\u2014with a talk on what he dubbed \u201cFour Fallacies.\u201d The lecture argues that technology alone cannot deliver quick, clean military victories; commando raids don\u2019t amount to a military strategy; proxy forces aren\u2019t enough to win a conflict; and deterring war by demonstrating the presence, strength and capability to defeat an enemy is vital.His idea underpins NATO strategy in Europe: the move to eastern and central Europe of four battle groups led by the U.S. and its allies, plus America\u2019s deployment of a 3,500-soldier heavy brigade.NATO\u2019s maneuvers are also a response to the Russian gambit devised by Gen. Gerasimov, who has overseen Russian military modernization and its innovative use of its armed forces in Ukraine, Syria and elsewhere.4u (300px)100 miles100 kmBorder region where drills will be performedFinlandRUSSIA", "news_time": "2017-06-16 10:37:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-new-cold-war-pits-a-u-s-general-against-his-longtime-russian-nemesis-1497623852", "news_title": "The New Cold War Pits a U.S. General Against His Longtime Russian Nemesis", "keywords": "armor,cold war,defense policy,europe,military equipment,military exercises,military strategy,tanks,NATO,U.S. Army,Donald Trump,H.R.

But is the Paris accord really all that stands between the planet and the worst of climate change? Certainly not.This is not to deny that President Trump\u2019s announcement was problematic. He failed to acknowledge that global warming is real and wrongly claimed that China and India are the \u201cworld\u2019s leading polluters.\u201d (China and the U.S. are the largest emitters of carbon dioxide, and the U.S. is the biggest per capita.) It was far-fetched for him to suggest that the treaty will be \u201crenegotiated.\u201d Worse, the White House now has no response to climate change.But the global consensus about the Paris treaty is wrongheaded too. It risks wasting huge resources to do almost nothing to fix the climate problem while shortchanging approaches that promise the most transformative results.Consider the Paris agreement\u2019s preamble, which states that signatories will work to keep the rise in average global temperature \u201cwell below\u201d 2 degrees Celsius and even suggests that the increase could be kept to 1.5 degrees. This is empty political rhetoric. Based on current carbon dioxide emissions, achieving the target of 1.5 degrees would require the entire planet to abandon fossil fuels in four years.But the treaty has deeper problems. The United Nations organization in charge of the accord counted up the national carbon-cut pledges for 2016 to 2030 and estimated that, if every country met them, carbon dioxide emissions would be cut by 56 gigatons. It is widely accepted that restricting temperature rises to 2 degrees Celsius would require a cut of some 6,000 gigatons, that is, about a hundredfold more.The Paris treaty is not, then, just slightly imperfect. Even in an implausibly optimistic, best-case scenario, the Paris accord leaves the problem virtually unchanged. Those who claim otherwise are forced to look beyond the period covered by the treaty and to hope for a huge effort thereafter.The treaty commits nations to specific and reasonably verifiable (but nonbinding) cuts in carbon emissions until the year 2030. After that, nothing really is concrete, for a very understandable reason: Could you imagine a carbon-cutting promise made by President       Bill Clinton       being fulfilled by Mr. Trump? Could you see a Democrat in 2035 feeling honor-bound by policies set by Mr. Trump today?Now ask the same sort of questions about every country that has signed the treaty. Rose-tinted hopes for the accord\u2019s success rely on heroic assumptions about what tomorrow\u2019s world leaders will do. If what we need is a carbon diet, the Paris treaty is just a promise to eat one salad today, pushing all the hard self-restraint far into the future.History gives us cause for skepticism about overly optimistic forecasts, even over much shorter spans. In 1993, Mr. Clinton committed the U.S. to cutting emissions by 2000, but he ditched the promise seven years later. In 1992, the industrialized nations promised that they would lower their emissions to 1990 levels by 2000. Nearly every country failed. Before the Paris treaty, the Kyoto Protocol was sold as a key part of the solution to global warming, but a recent study in the Journal of Environmental Economics and Management shows that it achieved virtually nothing.In the wake of Mr. Trump\u2019s exit from the Paris treaty, there have been many claims that solar and wind energy will soon be ready to power the world. This also isn\u2019t true.Just 0.6% of the world\u2019s energy needs are currently met by solar and wind, according to the International Energy Agency. Even with implementation of the Paris treaty, solar and wind are expected to contribute less than 3% of world energy by 2040. Fossil fuels will go from meeting 81% of our energy needs to three-quarters. The energy expert       Vaclav Smil       of the University of Manitoba puts it bluntly: \u201cClaims of a rapid transition to a zero-carbon society are plain nonsense.\u201dThough there are contexts in which solar and wind energy are efficient, in most situations they depend on subsidies. These will cost $125 billion this year and $3 trillion over the next 25 years, to meet less than 3% of world energy needs. If solar and wind truly out-competed fossil fuels, the Paris treaty would be unnecessary.On this issue, even the climate scientist James Hansen, who advises former Vice President       Al Gore,        agrees: \u201cSuggesting that renewables will let us phase rapidly off fossil fuels in the U.S., China, India, or the world as a whole is almost the equivalent of believing in the Easter Bunny and Tooth Fairy.\u201dAdvocates of global carbon cuts fail to acknowledge the wider costs of subsidizing certain energy sources. A global pact in which governments promise to use more expensive energy ensures that the world economy will develop at a slower pace. This adds up to an immense expense: $1 to $2 trillion by 2030 and each year for the rest of the century, mostly in lost GDP growth. This represents $150 to $300 for every person in the world, every year.Taxpayers in wealthy nations may well ask whether this money could be better spent on schools, hospitals or care for the elderly. In developing countries with more immediate problems, there are definitely more productive ways to use the money. A global poll of almost 10 million people conducted by the U.N. finds that climate change is the lowest priority behind health, education, food and 11 other priorities. Work by the Copenhagen Consensus, which I oversee, has highlighted the many investments in nutrition, health and other areas that would help vulnerable communities much more than would any possible benefits from carbon cuts.Acknowledging the Paris treaty\u2019s flaws does not mean endorsing the Trump administration\u2019s apparent intention to ignore climate change. Real progress in reducing carbon emissions and global temperatures will require far-reaching advances in green energy, and that will mean massive investment in research and development\u2014an annual global commitment of some $100 billion, according to analysis by the Copenhagen Consensus. When green energy is economically competitive, the whole world will rush to use it.The real misfortune for the planet isn\u2019t that Mr. Trump withdrew the U.S. from the Paris treaty. Rather, it is that his administration has shown no interest in helping to launch the green-energy revolution that the world so urgently needs.\u2014Mr. Lomborg is the president of the Copenhagen Consensus Center and the author of \u201cThe Skeptical Environmentalist\u201d and \u201cCool It.\u201d", "news_time": "2017-06-16 10:36:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-charade-of-the-paris-treaty-1497623798", "news_title": "The Charade of the Paris Treaty", "keywords": "bjorn lomborg,climate change,global warming,green energy, paris accord,paris climate, paris climate accord,paris treaty,solar power,wind power,political,general news,natural environment,global,world issues,politics,international relations,domestic politics"}, {"content": "Columbia Business School Dean Glenn Hubbard, in a Wall Street Journal op-ed, calls for rethinking \u201cthe Fed by evaluating its strategy, structure and accountability\u2026Fortunately, experience with Fed success and failure offers a road map.\u201d", "news_time": "2017-06-16 10:36:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-to-keep-the-fed-from-following-its-models-off-a-cliff-1497623767", "news_title": "How to Keep the Fed From Following Its Models Off a Cliff", "keywords": "Columbia Business School,economic news,commentaries,opinions"}, {"content": "SAN FRANCISCO\u2014California lawmakers advanced new measures\u00a0intended to block the growth of immigrant detention facilities in the state and fund $45 million in new spending over three years that could provide free attorneys for immigrants facing deportation.The new policies, which passed as part of a package of bills that accompanied the state\u2019s $125 billion budget deal, mark the latest moves by the state to attempt to shield the nation\u2019s largest population of illegal immigrants.California is home to about 2.6 million of the 10.9 million undocumented immigrants estimated to be living in the U.S., according to the Center for Migration Studies, a nonprofit based in New York.Late\u00a0Thursday, both houses of the\u00a0Democratic-controlled\u00a0state Legislature passed a bill that blocks local governments and law enforcement from making new contracts or expanding existing contracts with the federal government to detain undocumented immigrants. The bill also gives new powers to the California\u2019s attorney general to review conditions at\u00a0the state\u2019s immigrant-detention facilities.Both houses also voted to modify and expand an existing legal fund administered through the state\u2019s Department of Social Services so attorneys could provide deportation defense. The state\u2019s budget allocates an extra $15 million a year for three years to that fund.California Gov.       Jerry Brown,        a Democrat, is expected to sign all of the measures.Under President       Donald Trump,        immigration agents have been successful in increasing the pace of arrests of illegal immigrants.Through executive orders, the Republican president has also sought to crack down on cities that limit cooperation with federal-immigration enforcement and institute restrictions on U.S. entry for people from six Muslim-majority countries. Federal courts have blocked those efforts.Senate\u00a0President       Kevin de Le\u00f3n,        a Democrat, said\u00a0California\u00a0is enacting policies in response to \u201cmean-spirited, divisive rhetoric from the White House\u201d and Congress\u2019s \u201cdereliction of duty\u201d for not \u201cnormalizing the status of millions of people who have been here for decades.\u201dSen.       Mike Morrell       of Rancho Cucamonga, a Republican who represents a portion of the Inland Empire, the region east of Los Angeles that has both a large immigration population and active conservative groups, opposed the measures.\u201cAmerica has a long tradition of welcoming law-abiding immigrants,\u201d Mr. Morrell said. \u201cHowever, with the actions being taken by California Democrats to severely limit cooperation between state and local law enforcement and their federal counterparts, the safety of our families and friends is being jeopardized.\u201dNikki Marquez,        an attorney with the Immigrant Legal Resource Center, an immigration advocacy group, said the limitations on detention will make it more expensive and difficult for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to expand in the state.\u201cThe\u00a0hope is this will be a model for other states,\u201d Ms. Marquez said of the bill limiting detention contracts and adding oversight by the attorney general. \u201cThere needs to be some level of increased review and oversight in terms of conditions and confinement.\u201dAn ICE official said the agency uses a variety of facilities throughout the country \u201cto meet the agency\u2019s detention needs while achieving the highest possible cost savings for the taxpayer.\u201d\u201cPlacing limitations on ICE\u2019s detention options here in California won\u2019t prevent the agency from detaining immigration violators,\u201d said the official, who declined to be named because the agency said it has a policy against commenting on pending legislation.\u201cIt will simply mean ICE will have to transfer individuals encountered in California to detention facilities outside the state, at a greater distance from their family, friends and legal representatives,\u201d the official said. Detention facilities \u201cmust already meet rigorous performance standards,\u201d the official said.The new California policies would build on multiple efforts to shield immigrants in the state from deportation.A state law that went into effect earlier this year allows some immigrants to challenge their past convictions so they are less vulnerable to deportations targeting undocumented immigrants with criminal convictions.The Legislature is also considering a proposal this year by Mr.\u00a0de Le\u00f3n\u00a0that would prohibit law-enforcement agencies from investigating or detaining people for the purposes of immigration enforcement.That measure, which has been dubbed the \u201csanctuary state\u201d proposal and the subject of fierce debate, passed in the Senate earlier this year and this week advanced through an Assembly committee.Dave Ray,        a spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which supports restrictions on immigration into the U.S. and further enforcement of laws against illegal immigration, said the group supported \u201cadequate conditions\u201d at detention facilities. But the state\u2019s policies were taking it in the wrong direction, he said.\u201cCalifornia\u2019s going out of its way to shield illegal aliens from the consequences of their actions, yet it\u2019s perfectly happy to punish U.S. citizens when they break the laws,\u201d he said. \u201cThe state seems to be endlessly dedicated to ensuring that those who violate our immigration laws skirt the consequences.\u201dThe state is\u00a0also\u00a0re-examining how it adjudicates traffic infractions, potentially paving a new way for the state to protect undocumented immigrants.Last month, a 17-person panel of justices, judges, attorneys and parole officers presented a recommendation to California Chief Justice       Tani Cantil-Sakauye       to try minor traffic infractions in civil court instead of criminal court.Chief Justice Cantil-Sakauye \u201cwholeheartedly\u201d backed the idea and last month directed the Judicial Council to draft a proposal to state lawmakers.The proposal would help insulate undocumented immigrants charged with a range of minor traffic infractions\u2014like driving with a broken taillight\u2014from a wide deportation net targeting those charged with a criminal offense.Chief Justice Cantil-Sakauye said the proposal wasn\u2019t motivated by immigration enforcement, but the panel weighed the proposal\u2019s implications for undocumented immigrants.\u201cI have spoken up and looked to reform all that can be improved and maintain equal access to justice\u2026for people who are citizens, people who are residents, for people who are here without the appropriate papers,\u201d the chief justice said.Write to Alejandro Lazo at alejandro.lazo@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-16 10:32:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/california-seeking-to-curtail-spread-of-immigrant-detention-centers-in-state-1497622962", "news_title": "California Seeking to Curtail Spread of Immigrant Detention Centers in State", "keywords": "california immigrants,california politics,detention centers,illegal immigrants,immigration,immigration detention,immigration reform,undocumented immigrants,economic performance,indicators,budget account,government finance,government budget,taxation,economic news,political,general news,national,public security,crime,legal action,law enforcement,illegal immigration,migration,politics,international relations,prisons,prisoners"}, {"content": "In 1990, \u201cBathsheba,\u201d a painting of a voluptuous biblical-era nude, sold for $2.2 million at a             Sotheby\u2019s                   auction in New York. Though some snooty critics have long dismissed the artist,       Jean-L\u00e9on G\u00e9r\u00f4me,        and his exquisite, intensely erotic late 19th-century canvas, the sale set a record price for the painter. A few weeks ago, the same canvas fetched around $630,000 in London, less than one-third the price it brought a quarter-century ago.What happened?The sad truth is that much of vintage Old School art has had it. If your paintings have names like \u201cExcursion of the Harem\u201d or \u201cTurkish Butcher Boy in Jerusalem,\u201d it\u2019s time to take a seat on the bench. But it\u2019s not just Victorian showboats that are sinking. At a recent London auction, an 1851 landscape by Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot, with an estimated low, low, low sale price of one-third what it fetched in 2006, went unsold. This despite the fact that the universally admired Corot never painted gaudy visions of Turkish butcher boys or voluptuous nudes. Mostly he stuck to ponds, marshes and cows.Prices for contemporary artists, by contrast, have been going through the roof. A painting by the late       Jean-Michel Basquiat      recently sold for a jaw-dropping $110.5 million.

Lexitron\u2019s Videotype machines sold for around $20,000.After Lexitron was sold to Raytheon Co. for about $15 million in the late 1970s, Mr. Goldman and his family moved to Israel. At the time, oil prices were soaring amid worries that the world would soon run out of crude. He founded a company called Luz International, which developed nine solar plants in the Mojave Desert near Barstow, Calif., in the 1980s. At one point, Luz accounted for an estimated 90% of the world\u2019s solar-power output.Luz sank into bankruptcy in 1991 as tax breaks expired and worries about energy shortages faded. Mr. Goldman made a solar comeback in 2006 by founding BrightSource Energy Inc. BrightSource provided the technology for the Ivanpah solar plant in the Mojave Desert, about 50 miles southwest of Las Vegas.Mr. Goldman died May 29 in Tel Aviv, where he had been having cancer treatment. He was 74.Arnold Jay Goldman was born Jan. 9, 1943, in Providence, R.I. His family moved to Southern California when he was 12. His father was a financial executive for a retailer of women\u2019s clothing.The younger Mr. Goldman, who reached maturity as the space race spurred interest in science, earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in electrical engineering at the University of California, Los Angeles, and a master\u2019s degree at the University of Southern California. His early employers included a maker of missile-guidance equipment.Stephen Kurtin, a student at the California Institute of Technology, met Mr. Goldman and was impressed by ideas he had about new types of computer architecture. Mr. Kurtin believed Mr. Goldman\u2019s ideas were well-suited for manipulating and displaying text in a new kind of electronic typewriter with a screen, something that became known as a word processor. The two men joined with Carver Mead, a Caltech professor, to set up Lexitron.One problem was that customers, including big banks and insurers, preferred to lease the machines rather than buy them. The leasing business required more capital than the tiny company could easily muster, so selling to Raytheon became a solution. Raytheon exited the word-processing business in the 1980s as more versatile personal computers eclipsed word processors.Mr. Goldman\u2019s Luz International developed technology using mirrors to reflect sunlight, heating synthetic oil, which then heated water to produce steam and turn an electric turbine.Mr. Goldman blamed the 1991 failure of Luz partly on the loss of a property-tax exemption. Luz also was burdened by generation costs well above those of conventional power plants. Solar plants developed by Luz continue to operate under the ownership of             NextEra Energy Inc.Mr. Goldman came up with more efficient solar technology for BrightSource and used it to build the $2.2 billion Ivanpah plant, financed partly with $1.6 billion of U.S. government loan guarantees.Glinting like a shattered mirror on the dun desert floor, the plant uses more than 170,000 mirrors to reflect sunlight to 459-foot towers topped with boilers, creating steam to generate electricity. The plant, which began operating in 2014 and sells power to two utilities, is owned by             NRG Energy Inc.,       BrightSource and             Alphabet Inc.\u2019s       Google. (California law requires utilities to obtain a portion of their power needs from solar or other renewable energy sources.)The plant\u2019s operators spent more than $20 million relocating and nurturing desert tortoises found on or near the site, amid pressure from environmentalists. They also have set up various devices to shoo away birds to keep them from being incinerated.BrightSource also has projects in Israel and China but shelved plans for an initial public offering in 2012.

The drugs are now standard treatment for breast cancer in postmenopausal women.They work by blocking aromatase, an enzyme key to the production of estrogen. Studies have shown that it can reduce the risk of recurrence of breast cancer after surgery compared with an older drug, tamoxifen, and versions of the treatment have been marketed by some of the biggest drug companies including AstraZeneca PLC and Pfizer Inc.Dr. Brodie, a biologist, worked as a laboratory research assistant at a U.K. cancer hospital earlier in her career and knew that estrogen could fuel the growth of certain breast tumors. Her idea: test whether an experimental estrogen-blocking drug could cut off that fuel line.\u201cHer great insight was to block the synthesis of the estrogen altogether,\u201d said Margaret M. McCarthy, chairwoman of the department of pharmacology at University of Maryland School of Medicine, where Dr. Brodie spent most of her career.Dr. Brodie died June 7 at her home in Fulton, Md., from pancreatic cancer and complications of Parkinson\u2019s disease, her husband, Dr. Harry Brodie said. She was 82 years old. Her husband said Dr. Brodie was persistent in her research despite lack of encouragement from drug companies. \u201cShe was very tenacious,\u201d he said. \u201cShe was a hard worker.\u201dBorn Angela Mary Hartley on Sept. 28, 1934, in Oldham, England, Dr. Brodie\u2019s father was an industrial chemist and her mother a homemaker. She attended a Quaker school before getting her undergraduate degree at University of Sheffield and a Ph.D. from the University of Manchester.Dr. Brodie came to the U.S. in the early 1960s on a fellowship from the National Institutes of Health that included research at the Worcester Foundation for Experimental Biology in Massachusetts. There she met Dr. Harry Brodie, a chemist. They married in 1964.Though not a practicing Quaker, Dr. Brodie subscribed to the faith\u2019s pacifism, her husband said, and they participated in protests against the Vietnam War.In the Worcester lab, her husband began to synthesize aromatase inhibitors. \u201cHis idea was that they might be useful as contraceptives,\u201d she said in 2010 at the Breast Cancer Research Foundation\u2019s annual symposium and awards ceremony. \u201cBut with my background in breast cancer I really thought they had the potential to become a useful treatment for breast cancer.\u201dShe conducted animal studies to test her hypothesis. In 1979, Dr. Brodie moved to Maryland and joined the faculty at the University of Maryland. She continued her research, but had a tough time convincing drug companies to test the drugs in humans.A presentation she made at a scientific conference in Rome helped break the logjam. A British oncologist, Charles Coombes, attended it and asked to collaborate with her. Dr. Brodie and her staff made a batch of an aromatase inhibitor and sent it to Dr. Coombes to conduct a small clinical trial of breast-cancer patients in London.The drug was effective, and drugmaker Ciba-Geigy, which later became             Novartis AG      , agreed to sponsor larger studies and market the drug. The company paid her a consulting fee for several years, her husband said. The treatment, an injected drug called formestane, was approved for sale in Europe in the 1990s but not in the U.S. The industry developed other aromatase inhibitors in the form of pills that were considered more convenient for patients, such as AstraZeneca\u2019s Arimidex and Pfizer \u2019s Aromasin. Dr. Brodie officially retired from the University of Maryland last year, but continued to work as a professor emeritus in the pharmacology department.\u201cAngela was a towering scientific figure at a time when very few women were,\u201d Dr. McCarthy said. \u201cTo achieve all that she did took a tremendous amount of grit. She served as a great role model. She\u2019s had many female trainees who have gone on with successful careers.\u201dDr. Brodie published more than 200 papers in peer-reviewed scientific journals, the University of Maryland said. Her awards included the Charles F. Kettering Prize from the General Motors Cancer Research Awards in 2005 and the Dorothy P. Landon-AACR Prize for Translational Cancer Research in 2006.Outside the lab, Dr. Brodie liked to climb mountains and ride horses, her husband said. In addition to her husband, she is survived by a son, Mark Brodie, a drama teacher living in La Crescenta, Calif.; and two grandchildren.

He also brought seedless watermelons, multicolored sweet peppers and vine-ripened tomatoes to produce aisles across the country. Each was a hit with consumers hungry for variety at a time when many distributors were focused on shelf life.\u201cHe was a visionary,\u201d said Bob DiPiazza, who began buying from Mr. Marguleas in the 1980s as head of produce at the Dominick\u2019s chain of supermarkets in Chicago. \u201cWhen you were used to having to spit out all those watermelon seeds and all of a sudden you didn\u2019t have to, that was a big deal.\u201dMr. Marguleas died June 1 in Rancho Mirage, Calif., of complications from cancer. He was 82 years old.Howard Philip Marguleas was born Dec. 5, 1934, in San Francisco to Joseph and Belle Marguleas. After graduating from the University of California, Berkeley with a degree in agricultural economics, he joined his father\u2019s produce-marketing firm, which was sold in 1970 to         Tenneco Inc.,       an energy conglomerate. Mr. Marguleas stayed on for a few years before founding his own company, Sun World International Inc.In an early hit, he introduced red flame seedless grapes that remain ubiquitous in U.S. grocery stores. But he didn\u2019t secure the rights to distribute them exclusively\u2014a misstep that became an important lesson.\u201cEveryone started growing red flame seedless grapes,\u201d said his son, David Marguleas, an executive vice president at Sun World. \u201cHe learned he needed produce that was differentiated and that could be branded at retail.\u201dMr. Marguleas resolved to secure exclusive rights to distribute new products consumers didn\u2019t know they wanted yet. The common denominator between many of his most popular breeds, said Mr. DiPiazza, the former Dominick\u2019s buyer, was convenience.\u201cConsumers were more and more pressed for time, and Howard saw that coming,\u201d Mr. DiPiazza said.Mr. Marguleas marketed yellow and red peppers and tomatoes that arrived ripe in stores. In the 1980s, he struck a distribution deal with a O.J. Eigsti, a geneticist from the Midwest who had developed a seedless watermelon breed decades earlier. Mr. Eigsti died in 2003.\u201cHe really believed in marketing something that consumers wanted as opposed to what producers might already be growing,\u201d said       Karen Ross,        Secretary of California\u2019s Department of Food and Agriculture.In the early 1990s, Mr. Marguleas sold Sun World to         Cadiz Inc.,       a water and property management company. He continued to invest in efforts to breed new citrus and other produce varieties.Mr. Marguleas is survived by his wife of 59 years, Ardith, their four children and nine grandchildren.

Jeff Davis,        a Pentagon spokesman, said the U.S. military had \u201cno information to corroborate those reports\u201d of Baghdadi\u2019s death.In Washington, a senior administration official said the U.S. wasn\u2019t able to corroborate the Russian claim. \u201cAt this point the claims seem to have a number of infirmities,\u201d the official said, noting there has been a pattern of unconfirmed claims by Russia and Syria in the fight against extremists in Syria.U.S. military and intelligence officials are examining the claim and evidence for it, the official said.Another senior U.S. official said Russia has reasons to play up their Syria strikes and make sweeping claims of success, even if evidence of that success isn\u2019t clear. The official couldn\u2019t confirm whether the airstrike in May hit Baghdadi, who has been reported killed several times before.A Syrian pro-government news website carried a report on June 11 saying Syrian state television had reported the previous weekend that Baghdadi had been killed in an airstrike in Raqqa.The U.S. and Russia are backing opposing sides in the Syrian conflict, with Moscow supporting the government of Syrian President       Bashar al-Assad       and the U.S. backing antigovernment rebels. But both Moscow and Washington target Islamic State.The Russian military said Friday that the U.S. was notified in advance about the time and location of the airstrike in May.Baghdadi has generally remained in hiding. In November 2016, he delivered a rare audio recording, after a nearly yearlong silence, in which he called on his followers to defend Islamic State strongholds.Russia has stepped up its attacks against Islamic State in Syria, although they don\u2019t account for the majority of Russian strikes, which target antigovernment rebels, according to U.S. officials. The strategy is designed, the U.S. official said, to gain diplomatic leverage internationally and bolster Moscow\u2019s case that it is doing more than just propping up       Mr. Assad.The Russian military\u2019s claim it had killed Baghdadi may also be intended for a domestic audience.Ahead of scheduled elections next year, Russian President       Vladimir Putin       is trying to shore up his image as a strong leader who can protect Russia, and has ramped up strikes against Islamic State to help him make his case, the U.S. official said.Russia faces a growing threat from Islamic State affiliates in the Caucasus region and former Soviet republics, an issue of growing concern to the Russian government.Since U.S.-backed Kurdish and Arab forces launched an offensive on Raqqa last week, residents of the city and anti-Islamic State activists have reported increased coalition airstrikes and artillery attacks.The airstrikes have hit internet cafes, hospitals, mosques, schools and other municipal buildings, and killed dozens of civilians, the residents and activists said. Much of the city\u2019s infrastructure was taken over by Islamic State in 2014 and became part of the bureaucracy of its self-declared caliphate.An audio message circulated Monday on Islamic State social media channels and attributed to spokesman       Abi al-Hassan al-Muhajer       urged \u201csoldiers of the caliphate\u201d to remain steadfast in Syria and Iraq and followers around the world to follow suit.\u2014Raja Abdulrahim and       Noam Raydan       in Beirut,       Nour Alakraa       in Berlin and Carol E.

The Sony executives\u2019 contracts with the studio were up this\u00a0August, and Mr. Cue moved to bring them on board because he was impressed with their experience in the industry.In a statement, Mr. Erlicht said, \u201cwe want to bring to video what Apple has been so successful with in their other services and consumer products\u2014unparalleled quality.\u201d\u00a0Mr. Van Amburg added, \u201cWe could not be more excited about what lies ahead.\u201dIn addition to developing shows\u00a0they hope will\u00a0break through in today\u2019s crowded media market, the executives will have to\u00a0sort through\u00a0questions including\u00a0whether\u00a0Apple\u00a0will launch\u00a0a new TV-subscription service,\u00a0as it has long desired.

It has previously claimed a massive suicide bombing at a mostly Shiite demonstration in July and two other deadly attacks on mosques last year.Sectarian violence was once rare in Afghanistan, unlike in Syria or Iraq where it has torn countries apart. Afghan Shiites worry that a growing Islamic State presence there may add yet another dimension to a conflict that has dragged on for decades.Kabul is already in a state of political and social turmoil following an eruption of violence weeks earlier when a massive truck bomb killed at least 150 people in a heavily fortified diplomatic area.The violence during the holy month of Ramadan is fueling public anger with the government and suspicion among rival political and ethnic groups, who blame each other for the deteriorating security situation. The Afghan Shiite population is mostly made up of ethnic Hazaras.Thursday\u2019s attack began when the militants opened fire on police guarding the popular       Al Zahra       mosque and managed to get inside. One detonated his explosives while at least one other opened fire on the terrorized crowd inside, sending people fleeing into the streets.Police said they shot and killed two attackers in the mosque\u2019s kitchen. Other Afghan officials said just one gunman had been involved after the blast.A witness said that local residents, including women and children, were seen fleeing the area around the mosque for their homes, fearing a follow-up attack.In a sign of growing local frustration with the country\u2019s security institutions, local Hazara men took up arms in the streets and set up checkpoints on the roads to search passing vehicles for other potential attackers\u2014a job usually performed by the police.Earlier this week, U.S. President       Donald Trump       gave the Pentagon unilateral authority to send thousands of new American troops to Afghanistan at its discretion, clearing the way for the U.S. military to intensify its fight against the Taliban-led insurgency.Mr. Trump has yet to reveal a broad strategy, however, for the 16-year war at a time when the Taliban have swept large parts of the country and are threatening at least half a dozen provincial capitals.Write to Jessica Donati at Jessica.Donati@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-16 09:12:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/suicide-bomber-attacks-shiite-mosque-in-kabul-1497563556", "news_title": "Suicide Bomber Attacks Shiite Mosque in Kabul", "keywords": " kabul,mosque attack, mosque blast, shia, shiite,Al Zahra,political,general news,national,public security,society,community,crime,legal action,religion,terrorism"}, {"content": "Bad news, Einstein fans.The genius behind the theory of relativity is regularly credited with discovering a clever accounting rule for investments then reeling off a witty quote to go with it.But Albert Einstein is not the brains behind the Rule of 72, nor did he originate, or perhaps even utter, the quote.The Rule of 72 is a shortcut to estimate how long it will take an investment to double in value. It\u2019s less precise than the logarithmic equation that will produce an exact answer, but it\u2019s easier to figure out in your head.Here\u2019s how it works: Divide 72 by an investment\u2019s interest rate, without any decimal point. The result is approximately how long it will take the money to double given a compounded, fixed annual rate of return.\u201cIf you take your interest rate, say 8%, and divide it into 72, you get 9,\u201d said Murphy Smith, an accounting professor at Texas A&M University in Corpus Christi. \u201cIt lets you know that it will take about 9 years for an investment earning 8% interest to double.\u201dApplying the Rule of 72 can help anyone quickly discern the significance of a rate of growth, whether it has to do with interest or, say, population.It reveals that the value of an investment earning 6% interest will double in 12 years, but an investment earning 4% will take 18 years to double.It shows that if Conroe, Texas, the fastest-growing city in the U.S., continues to grow at a rate of 7.8%, its population will double in less than a decade.\u201cIt really is uncanny the way it works,\u201d Dr. Smith said.Finding the precise answer requires a calculation that doesn\u2019t come as easily as the Rule of 72. But for those who want to test the logarithmic equation with a calculator or spreadsheet, divide the natural log of 2 by the natural log of 1 plus the rate of return (this time with the decimal point).Although books by high-school teachers and college professors and articles by bloggers and financial advisers have credited Einstein with discovering the Rule of 72, the calculation has been around for more than 500 years.The author of the rule is unknown, but it was first published in 1494 by an Italian friar obsessed with math.       Luca Pacioli       included the rule in his book \u201cSumma de arithmetica geometria, proporzioni et proporzionalita,\u201d a guide to arithmetic, algebra, geometry, accounting and weights and measures.\u201cIt is all things mathematical,\u201d said Dr. Smith, who noted that what Pacioli wrote about accounting is still relevant today.Sources that credit Einstein with the Rule of 72 often attribute a quote about compounding interest to him as well. The wording varies, but \u201cThe Ultimate Quotable Einstein\u201d includes these versions: \u201cCompounded interest is more complicated than relativity theory.\u201d \u201cThe most powerful force in the universe is compound interest.\u201d \u201cThe most significant invention of the nineteenth century is compounded interest.\u201dAccording to the collection, Burton Malkiel, an economist and author of the classic 1973 finance book \u201cA Random Walk Down Wall Street,\u201d is among those who have attributed the thought to Einstein.So is former U.S. Treasury Secretary John W.

We set out very clearly our desired outcome...But it is a negotiation. And as we go into that negotiation, my clear view is\u2026we should prioritize protecting jobs, protecting economic growth and protecting prosperity,\u201d he said.According to the EU official, several alternatives to the radical departure from the single market have been worked out and are ready to be negotiated, but first the U.K. government should clarify what it wants. \u201cWe are prepared for everything. We have all scenarios ready,\u201d the official said.Under the so-called Norway scenario, which is the preferred option in Brussels, the U.K. would continue to be a member of the EU\u2019s single market, but would have to make annual contributions to the EU budget and accept the jurisdiction of a supranational court and EU rules and standards it can no longer influence.\u00a0These requirements would make it difficult for some in Mrs. May\u2019s party to swallow and would limit London\u2019s ability to control immigration from the EU.The Turkey model, a customs union agreement with the EU, would give the U.K. some access to the bloc\u2019s market but would have the drawback that the U.K. won\u2019t be able to negotiate its own preferential trade deals, a main tenet of Mrs. May\u2019s Brexit strategy.Under the Swiss model, sectoral agreements would be struck for the U.K.\u2019s participation in the single market, but the U.K. would again need to pay annual contributions to the EU budget, also a step that could prove difficult politically for the May government. Another wrinkle in the Swiss model is that the EU so far has said it would reject any sectoral deals for fear this might incentivize other countries to depart and then cherry-pick their way back into the single market.The expectation in Brussels is that it will take at least until September at the Conservative Party\u2019s conference to iron out what the end-goal for the U.K. is.Meanwhile, the EU official said, talks are likely to focus on divorce matters: the rights of EU citizens in the U.K. after Brexit and on how much the U.K. still owes the bloc by the time it will leave.Some British government ministers had previously opposed the EU\u2019s approach which called for settling key elements of the divorce agreement before moving on to negotiations over the future relationship. But with British goals for the future uncertain, this sequence may now suit London.EU countries are unlikely to accept starting negotiations about the future relationship with the U.K. \u201cbefore they know what Brexit means for them until the last cent,\u201d the official said. Only after that, in December at the earliest, but more likely next year, can negotiations commence on what Britain\u2019s future relationship with the bloc will look like.In recent days, French President       Emmanuel Macron       and Germany\u2019s finance minister,       Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble,        have suggested that the door to the EU remains open were the U.K. to U-turn completely and withdraw its Brexit request.But that would require unanimity from all 27 EU countries, a decision which could curtail some of U.K.\u2019s current membership benefits, the official said. \u201cI don\u2019t assume a U-turn, I don\u2019t read the result of the election as a reversal of Brexit,\u201d the official said.Write to Valentina Pop at valentina.pop@wsj.comAppeared in the June 17, 2017, print edition as 'Softer Brexit May Still Be Option.'", "news_time": "2017-06-16 08:53:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/eu-says-brexit-talks-to-assume-u-k-still-wants-complete-break-1497617620", "news_title": "EU Says Brexit Talks to Assume U.K. Still Wants Complete Break", "keywords": "brexit,brexitinsert,brexitinset ,brexit talks,emmanuel macron,european union,hard brexit,soft brexit,theresa may,European Union,euro zone,currency,economic news,political,general news,international relations,politics,domestic politics"}, {"content": "WashingtonIt\u2019s the worst kind of sportswriting clich\u00e9 to say it was a perfect day for baseball, but it really was, even if it was technically evening: a cloudless Thursday night in Washington, D.C., high 70s, mercifully low humidity. Shorts and T-shirt weather. Hot dog weather. Beer weather.Baseball weather. As if ordered on demand.The ballgame on the field looked ordinary, but it was not: this was the annual Congressional contest between Democrats and Republicans. It\u2019s a tradition, now in its 56th edition. Though the participants are known to take the game seriously, the clash of moonlighting politicians with aging shoulders and knees is typically a low-key charity event, hardly followed outside D.C.Not this one, however.The prior morning, a Republican team practice had been terrorized by an assailant with guns, who unleashed a torrent of bullets that struck four, including House majority whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana. Amid the fire and chaos, as Rep. Scalise (R., La.) crawled from his position at second base onto the outfield grass, Capitol police officers Crystal Griner and David Bailey rushed in, preventing further horror.The news shook the town.\u201cSome of us were in the dugout. Some of us were on the ground,\u201d the Republican team manager, Rep. Joe Barton (R., Texas), said in the aftermath. Barton\u2019s 10-year-old son, Jack, had accompanied his father to practice. \u201cJack got under an SUV. He was very brave.\u201dBarton promised that Thursday\u2019s game would go on as scheduled. There didn\u2019t appear to be any hesitation about it, even with Scalise in surgery and the President traveling to the hospital to offer support.\u201cIt was absolutely the right thing to do,\u201d said Scalise\u2019s teammate, Rep. Jeff Duncan (R., S.C.).And there they were, the next night, at the handsome big league Nationals Park, south of the Capitol, before a crowd that would swell close to 25,000\u2014a respectable weekday night for a major league franchise, and record for this game. Many thousands of tickets had been sold in the hours since the attack. A million and a half dollars would be raised, another record.Emotional touches abounded. Players on both teams wore gold and purple LSU caps, a nod to Scalise\u2019s home state and alma mater. Bailey, one of the Capitol police officers who took fire and saved lives on Wednesday, threw out the first pitch, briefly putting aside his crutches to make the ceremonial toss.In a city still trying to make sense of madness, the ballpark felt like a refuge.\u201cAmericans need to come together,\u201d said a fan named Nathan Johnson, who wore a flag headband. \u201cAn attack on a member is an attack on an institution.\u201dAs he stepped onto the impeccably-groomed infield, Duncan could not ignore an awkward feeling. He\u2019d left Wednesday\u2019s practice before the mayhem began\u2014he\u2019d actually run into the shooter in the parking lot, telling reporters later that a man had approached him and asked if the practice was Democrats or Republicans.Duncan plays shortstop. But for Thursday\u2019s game, he moved over to Scalise\u2019s position at second base.\u201cEvery time I ran out there, I wanted to run to shortstop,\u201d Duncan said. \u201cI was stopping at second, and thought: \u2018The reason I am here is that Steve is not.\u2019 It kept being driven home.\u201d\u201cI\u2019d rather have had him play second tonight.\u201dOver time, adrenaline settled, and the ballgame fell into a rhythm. A two-run Republican rally in the top of the first inning drew thunderous cheers, as did a three-run Democrat rally in the bottom half. There were nifty plays, and some slow scampers up the baseline.By the middle innings, the Democrats pulled away. Rep.       Cedric Richmond,        (D., La.), a friend and colleague of Scalise\u2019s from Louisiana, was sterling on the mound for the winners, giving up just five hits over seven in a 11-2 victory.Before the game, there\u2019d been lot of talk about the shooting and the agitated overall climate in Washington, D.C., and it had renewed calls for bipartisanship and unity. Whether that talk manifests into anything sustainable is unknown. The public has the good sense to be skeptical.But the players thought the baseball game was a start.\u201cTonight was good in so many ways, not only for our heart and soul as Republicans, but also for the Democrats, who reached across the aisle\u2014and not in a patronizing way, but in a conciliatory and comforting way,\u201d Rep. Dennis Ross, (R., Fla.), told my Journal colleague Siobhan Hughes. \u201cThey beat us pretty resoundingly, but that\u2019s OK. To not have played would have been the worst result of what happened.\u201d\u201cThis idea of people recognizing we\u2019re in this together\u2014it\u2019s something we really need in this country right now,\u201d said Rep. Thomas Suozzi, (D., N.Y.). \u201cThe ground is so fertile, because people are so sick of politics, and they want to get something done. Out of this tragedy and chaos hopefully will come a blessing. Life can change in an instant, and we\u2019ve got important work to do.\u201dAfter the final out, the Democratic team manager, Rep. Mike Doyle (D., Pa.), accepted the shiny Congressional game trophy\u2014and then, without hesitation, handed it over to Barton, the GOP skipper.\u201cJoe, I talked to my team, and what the Democrats would like to do is give you this trophy to put in Steve Scalise\u2019s office, until he\u2019s back on his feet,\u201d Doyle said.Barton took the trophy, and promised to do exactly that. \u201cWe congratulate our good friends on the Democratic side,\u201d he said. \u201cWe won\u2019t be this nice next year. We\u2019ll put this in Steve\u2019s office.\u201dSaid Doyle: \u201cTell him once he\u2019s healthy and gives us trouble again, we want it back.\u201dThese were small gestures in an anxious time, but they meant something.

It can create more Stories with the help of computers and scale its ad offering, or remain focused on the time-intensive, editor-curated content and ads that advertisers have grown to love. As advertisers grow more fearful of appearing next to inappropriate content on platforms like Google\u2019s YouTube, they\u2019ve come to appreciate Snapchat\u2019s custom and unique ad products. But the company is now public and must also cater to investors.\u2014What\u2019s Snap to do?--Snapchat says it\u2019s committed to human curation, but it has also hired people with machine-learning expertise and tested new software to help editors more quickly and efficiently craft Stories, reports The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Georgia Wells.

About 39% of the U.S. rural population, or 23 million people, lack access to broadband internet service, compared with 4% of urban residents. Broadband is considered fast internet (a minimum download speed of 25 megabits per second, according to the FCC) and can support email, web surfing, video streaming and graphics on more than one device at a time.\u2014The great divide\u2014In sparsely populated rural regions, broadband and other internet services are too expensive to configure. This means that advertisers moving more dollars over to digital video platforms like Facebook and YouTube, as well as internet-enabled TVs, might be missing a chunk of the population. As marketers rethink their ad content, which has been heavily skewed toward coastal elites, to reach more people in the middle of the country, perhaps they should also be embracing more traditional advertising means like broadcast TV.Do I really need that machine-learning chatbot algorithm app voice assistant to help me find the gutter bar in Cannes?

There was no mention of political, religious or personal grievances that could have prompted the attack, which killed eight and injured 65.The bombing outside the Fengxian Innovation Kindergarten drew the attention of top officials, who are particularly mindful of the nation\u2019s image ahead of a twice-a-decade leadership shuffle this fall. Shortly after the attack Thursday, China\u2019s minister of public security,       Guo Shengkun,        ordered a full investigation and dispatched a deputy minister to the site, according to China\u2019s state-run Xinhua News Agency.In an emergency notice Friday, the Ministry of Education ordered schools around the country to make thorough security checks and to resolve any disputes involving schools and students in a timely fashion.The bomb exploded near the end of the school day, according to local authorities. With classes still in session, the victims were mainly passersby. No students or teachers from the kindergarten were among the dead; it wasn\u2019t clear whether parents waiting outside the school were among the victims.Videos circulating online showed more than a dozen people on the ground in front of the kindergarten gate, some covered in blood. The videos couldn\u2019t be independently confirmed by The Wall Street Journal.Some local media originally said the blast was caused by a gas canister at a local food vendor. Authorities said Friday the cause was a homemade bomb made by the suspect, identified only by his last name, Xu.Some major questions remained unanswered Friday, including how Mr. Xu learned to make explosives and why he targeted the kindergarten.An official at Fengxian\u2019s propaganda office said Mr. Xu may have studied explosives at China University of Mining and Technology. He left the school in Xuzhou because of his health condition, authorities said, and moved to the Fengxian area for work.On Chinese social-media platforms, some cheered the government\u2019s swift investigation, while others expressed dissatisfaction with the explanation.\u201cSo this case has been cracked? What kind of conclusion is this?\u201d one online commenter wrote. \u201cThey should figure out all problems including the reason, details and the warnings for other people.\u201dThe Fengxian government didn\u2019t immediately provide a response to such social-media criticism Friday.Attacks on Chinese schools have included a string of stabbings in 2010. In many of the cases, the assailants\u2019 motives were unclear, and authorities blamed mental-health issues.Another series of deadly knife attacks, though not targeting schools, was carried out in 2014 by separatists from China\u2019s majority Muslim Xinjiang province.Bombers set off homemade explosives at the Beijing airport in 2013 and the Shanghai airport in 2016.

One segment would focus on mature companies not currently able to list in the city because their shares limit the voting rights for some investors. The other would be geared toward early-stage companies and be off-limits to retail investors.The exchange said creating the new board \u201cwould be the best way to attract a greater diversity of issuers to list in Hong Kong,\u201d citing a current lack of listings from companies in the fast-growing tech, biotech and health-care sectors.\u201cWe want to stay competitive, we want to stay relevant, and we want to continue to enhance market quality,\u201d said HKEX chief executive       Charles Li,        adding he expected the new board to be established early next year if the plan receives a positive response.The Hong Kong exchange\u2019s proposals come as major global exchanges are angling to host more companies\u2019 share listings. A particularly fierce battle is being fought to attract Saudi Arabian Oil Co., known as Saudi Aramco, the world\u2019s largest oil company by output, which is currently considering where to list its shares in an initial public offering that some estimate could value it at up to $2 trillion.London, New York and other global exchanges are also in the running for the Aramco IPO, and have faced pressure to change some of their listing rules to attract the oil giant.Mr. Li has previously said he hopes the creation of a new board will help attract multinational corporations such as Apple,             Disney                   and Aramco to list in the city, but said the latest proposal was geared toward attracting stocks in the \u201cnew economy\u201d.Dual-class shareholding structures offer different voting rights to different shareholders and are widely used in the U.S. by companies including             Facebook Inc.       and News Corp., the parent company of The Wall Street Journal.The Hong Kong exchange\u2019s refusal to allow such structures in the past cost it the initial public offering of             Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.      , which listed in New York in 2014. Hong Kong was the world\u2019s biggest IPO venue last year, according to data from the World Federation of Exchanges.But the exchange\u2019s plan is likely to encounter opposition from the local market regulator, the Securities and Futures Commission of Hong Kong, which in 2015 shot down a previous concept paper that asked market participants whether they would accept changing the principle of one share, one vote.\u201cWe encourage the public to express their views on these important proposals as they deal with some complex and difficult issues which have implications for the overall diversity and quality of the Hong Kong securities market,\u201d a spokesman for the SFC said.Mr. Li said the exchange had continued discussions to find an appropriate solution to the impasse with the regulator. \u201cThings do change,\u201d he said.Dual-class shareholding structures are unpopular with some investors. Global index provider MSCI said this week that it would consult on whether to exclude companies from its benchmark indexes if they don\u2019t offer much voting power to shareholders. The index provider cited feedback from investors after the initial public offering of             Snap Inc.,       which offered no voting rights to shareholders when it listed earlier this year.As part of its plans, the Hong Kong exchange said it would tighten some requirements for companies to list in the city so as to provide safeguards to investors, including minimum cash flow and market capitalization.Mainland Chinese companies with listings elsewhere, currently banned from selling shares in Hong Kong, could also be allowed to seek secondary listings in the city. That could help lure some of them back to Hong Kong, where they are more well-known by investors, said Eddie Wong, a partner at PwC\u2019s capital markets services group in Hong Kong.\u201cWe believe that this board will be very attractive to those companies that are currently listed in the U.S., in particular those in the new economy sector,\u201d he said.Write to Gregor Stuart Hunter at gregor.hunter@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-16 08:04:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/hkex-seeks-market-input-on-new-board-offering-weighted-voting-rights-1497604482", "news_title": "Hong Kong Exchange Pitches New Structure to Lure More Big Fish", "keywords": " china equities, china markets, equity markets, hong kong financial regulations,hong kong markets, hong kong regulators, hong kong stocks, stock markets,corporate changes,regulation,government policy,regulatory bodies,stock listings,corporate funding,share capital,initial public offerings,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,equity markets,commodity,financial market news,trusts,funds,financial vehicles,private equity,alternative investments,financial services,investing,securities"}, {"content": "TOKYO\u2014            Toshiba Corp.        TOSYY -2.51%       is lagging behind rival chip makers in securing next year\u2019s supply of silicon wafers, people in the industry said, showing how the company\u2019s troubles are hamstringing operations at its principal profit center.Toshiba is trying to sell its memory-chip unit for some $20 billion in a bid to survive after its U.S. nuclear unit, Westinghouse Electric, filed for bankruptcy protection in March and left Toshiba with multibillion-dollar losses. But the sale process has gotten bogged down. At a meeting Thursday, Toshiba\u2019s board failed to select a preferred bidder, people familiar with the meeting said. The company has said it wants the sale wrapped up by June 28.The semiconductor unit is riding a once-in-a-decade boom in demand thanks to the surge in internet-connected devices and services that rely on huge banks of computers storing data. One spillover effect of the boom is a shortage of silicon wafers, the material from which chips are created. Inventory levels have fallen to all-time lows and companies are hurrying to lock up supplies.People in the industry involved in contract negotiations said some of Toshiba\u2019s rivals have already agreed to price increases for next year\u2019s contracts so they can ramp up production, while they said Toshiba has held back in some cases.That could put Toshiba, the world\u2019s No. 2 maker of NAND flash memory, at a disadvantage in a fast-paced market. A Toshiba spokeswoman declined to comment on negotiations but said the company is working to deal with price rises for wafers.Toshiba remains two months behind market leader             Samsung Electronics Co.       in developing 3-D NAND chips, which are used in             Apple Inc.\u2019s       iPhones, analysts said.Companies involved in bidding for the Toshiba chip unit include             Foxconn Technology                   Group of Taiwan,             SK Hynix Inc.       of South Korea, U.S.-based             Broadcom Ltd.       and Toshiba\u2019s joint-venture partner             Western Digital Corp.      , according to people familiar with the matter. Private-equity firms and entities backed by the Japanese government are also involved.The sale has been hampered by a legal brawl with Western Digital and Japanese government opposition to a Chinese buyer.Western Digital says its contracts with Toshiba give it the right to block any other bidder and sued this week in California state court to prevent Toshiba from selecting a buyer. Toshiba says Western Digital has no such right of refusal.Meanwhile, Japanese government officials say they won\u2019t let Toshiba\u2019s technology get transferred to Chinese hands, and they have made clear privately that Foxconn, because of its extensive operations in China, would be blocked for that reason.Even if Western Digital resolved its dispute with Toshiba and made a deal to buy the Toshiba unit, antitrust regulators in China or elsewhere might object because Western Digital already has a big share of the NAND flash memory market.The delays are badly timed because the chip unit needs a deep-pocketed owner to fund expansion. The chip industry is in the midst of its largest growth year since 2010. NAND chips especially are hot, as consumers demand more storage in their smartphones.One person familiar with the matter said Toshiba views Broadcom\u2019s offer as the most attractive because the U.S. company has shown its commitment to beef up the chip unit\u2019s production.Chip companies anticipate 12% growth overall and 30% growth in memory in 2017, according to the World Semiconductor Trade Statistics.Japanese silicon wafer makers             Shin-Etsu Chemical Co.       and             Sumco Corp.       won their first price rises in more than a decade in the January-March quarter, according to executives from both companies at their most recent earnings announcements. Both companies supply to Toshiba, along with GlobalWafers Co.\u201cCustomers are prioritizing volume\u201d in negotiations, said SMBC Nikko Securities analyst Shinobu Takeuchi in a note to investors. He said the price of 300-millimeter wafers was likely to rise by about 40% by the end of 2018 compared with the end of 2016.Samsung said this week it would ramp up its 64-layer 3-D NAND production. Analysts expect Samsung to command a little less than half of 3-D NAND capacity by the end of the year.Write to Mayumi Negishi at mayumi.negishi@wsj.com and Takashi Mochizuki at takashi.mochizuki@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-16 08:03:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/toshiba-falls-behind-in-chip-development-race-1497614594", "news_title": "Toshiba Falls Behind in Chip-Development Race ", "keywords": " chips, memory chips, silicon wafers, technology,toshiba, unit sale,Toshiba,6502.TO,bankruptcy,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,corporate financial difficulty,computers,consumer electronics,personal electronics,technology"}, {"content": "LONDON\u2014British intelligence officials believe that a group linked to North Korea perpetrated last month\u2019s massive cyberattack, which crippled computer networks at British hospitals and other organizations around the world, a person familiar with the investigation said Friday.South Korea and some major cybersecurity firms have previously concluded the attack was perpetrated by the North Korean hacking group, dubbed \u201cLazarus,\u201d which had previously been implicated in the 2014 hacking of             Sony Entertainment.

North Korea has denied involvement in the Sony hacking and last month\u2019s attack.May\u2019s cyberattack used a worm called WannaCry, which locked hundreds of thousands of computers around the world and demanded payment to unlock them. The attack hit dozens of Britain\u2019s National Health Service organizations, including hospitals.British officials conducted similar detective work as cybersecurity firms to determine who was responsible for the attack. That involved examining WannaCry\u2019s code for similarities to worms used in previous attacks. They also used tools unavailable to private researchers, the person familiar the investigation said, and are now confident the attacker was the North Korean group.Still, government officials and private researchers say it is possible that the attacker planted false flags to deceive detectives about the culprit\u2019s identity, or that the attacker copied part of the code used by the North Korean group.The BBC reported on the British investigators\u2019 findings earlier Friday.Write to Stu Woo at Stu.Woo@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-16 07:52:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-k-says-north-korea-behind-wannacry-cybertattack-1497613920", "news_title": "U.K. Says North Korea Behind WannaCry Cybertattack", "keywords": " cyberattack, cybercrime, cybersecurity, cyberterrorism, hacking, nhs, nhs hacking, north korea,wannacry,Sony,6758.TO,SNE,political,general news,national,public security,crime,legal action,cybercrime,hacking,risk news,military action,computers,consumer electronics,personal electronics,technology"}, {"content": "Eurozone wages increased at a slower pace in the first three months of this year, despite a pickup in economic growth that has seen unemployment rates fall to eight-year lows.That slowdown in pay growth will likely reinforce the European Central Bank\u2019s caution in the face of calls from Germany to remove its stimulus measures, since policy makers see a pickup in pay as essential to meeting their inflation target.The European Union\u2019s statistics agency Friday said wages in the first quarter of 2017 were 1.4% higher than a year earlier, a smaller increase than the 1.6% recorded in the final three months of last year.The modest nature of the rise means wages lagged behind consumer prices over the same period, resulting in a drop in real incomes.The number of workers without jobs has fallen steadily since the eurozone\u2019s economy returned to growth in mid 2013, and ECB President       Mario Draghi       said five million jobs have been created since the start of 2014. The unemployment rate has fallen to its lowest level since March 2009, a bigger accomplishment than it may seem because the proportion of the adult population seeking work has increased, in contrast to the U.S.But in common with other parts of the developed world, that decline in joblessness hasn\u2019t translated into a pickup in wage growth.The ECB has said that may partly be because workers are looking back to the very low rates of inflation that persisted in 2015 and 2016 and asking for only modest pay rises. That may change in response to a pickup in inflation earlier this year.But it has also said that the kinds of jobs being created may not be the same as those that were lost during the financial crisis and the eurozone\u2019s subsequent debt crisis.\u201cWe have evidence that many\u2014it\u2019s hard to say what is the percentage, but many of these new jobs are so-called \u2018low-quality\u2019 jobs, where we\u2019re talking about temporary employment, we\u2019re talking about part-time employment,\u201d Mr. Draghi said in a news conference last week. \u201cIt may well be that this is actually slowing the growth of nominal wages.\u201dThe ECB\u2019s economists expect wage rises to pick up over coming years. In new forecasts released last week, they see wages rising by 2.4% in 2019 from 1.7% this year.Higher wages can boost inflation in two ways. With more money to spend, workers can bid up prices of goods and services, while businesses paying higher wages often raise their prices to cover their increased costs and maintain their profit margins.Without a sharper-than-expected pickup in wages, the ECB\u2019s economists don\u2019t expect inflation to hit policy makers\u2019 target of just under 2% through 2019. So while some German politicians want the central bank to start removing its stimulus measures, they are unlikely to get what they want soon.In its annual review of the eurozone economy released Thursday, the International Monetary Fund said it sees little pressure for a change of course.\u201cSubdued wage growth and underlying inflation suggest there is a long way to go before headline inflation durably meets the ECB\u2019s objective,\u201d the IMF said. \u201cMonetary policy should remain accommodative until there is a sustained shift in the inflation path.\u201dAcross the eurozone, there were some countries in which wages rose rapidly, but they were small economies in central Europe and the Baltic States where incomes are catching up with richer western Europe. In Germany, where the calls for an end to ECB stimulus are loudest, wages rose by 1.9%, a slowdown from 2.8% at the end of last year. And in Finland, where the economy has recently emerged from recession, wages actually fell by 1.6%, the first drop since the three months through June 2016.Write to Paul Hannon at paul.hannon@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-16 07:43:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/slower-eurozone-wage-growth-is-setback-for-ecb-1497603602", "news_title": "Slower Eurozone Wage Growth Is Setback for ECB", "keywords": " ecb, ecb policy, ecb stimulus, eurozone, eurozone qe,eurozone wages, qe,European Central Bank,labor,personnel,corporate,industrial news,workers pay,economic performance,indicators,inflation,prices,personal income,average earnings,employment,unemployment,monetary policy,central bank intervention,euro zone,currency,economic news,banking,central banking,credit,financial services"}, {"content": "Ulf Mark Schneider\u2019s       first strategic move as chief executive of             Nestl\u00e9        NSRGY 0.52%       is sweet but small.

In the merger of chemicals companies, Huntsman and             Clariant,        CLZNY -1.56%       investors have left a lot on the table.Huntsman of the U.S. and Clariant of Switzerland announced their $14 billion all-stock merger on May 22. The initial reaction to the deal, which offered no pricing premium to either side, was good. But both stocks have since slipped. Investors began to question the gains available from combining two groups with little overlap.But the strangest thing is the difference between Huntsman\u2019s stock price and its value under the terms of the deal, which turns each Huntsman share into the equivalent of 1.2196 Clariant shares.Huntsman has fallen further than Clariant. That has left each Huntsman share worth 5.9% less than its value in Clariant stock as of Friday morning in Europe.That discount has been fairly consistent in the weeks since the deal. The gap has been as wide as 8% at the end of last week and has averaged 6%. If the deal closed tomorrow, owners of Huntsman stock would make a handsome immediate gain, currently about $360 million.There is little antitrust or regulatory risk because there is such little product overlap. There is very little noise around potential third-party bidders coming in to disturb the deal by bidding for one of these two.Typically, a valuation gap like this ought to be traded away by arbitrage investors buying the cheap stock and selling the more expensive one. So what gives?Of the two, Clariant might be marginally more likely to attract an outside bidder because rivals have looked before, including             Evonik                   of Germany.

Subscribe to the podcast.But there are problems with this trade: Clariant has a group of family shareholders from a company it bought in 2011 who, like the management, don\u2019t want to sell the business. The trade also assumes Huntsman shares would fall if the merger was off.In fact, Huntsman shares might rally if the deal collapsed. The reason is that the U.S. company is spinning off and listing its volatile pigments and additives business, Venator, which is expected to bring in about $2 billion. The proceeds are now due to be shared between Huntsman and Clariant shareholders. If the deal didn\u2019t work out, Huntsman investors would get the lot.So, there seems a decent chance that Huntsman stock should rise relative to Clariant stock or absolutely whether the deal goes ahead or not. It is a real puzzle why there aren\u2019t more investors looking to exploit that valuation gap.With the deal due to close by the end of 2017, more investors should be tempted to pick up this free money in the months ahead.Write to Paul J.

Most recently, authorities detained       Wu Xiaohui,        the chairman of Anbang Insurance Group, one of China\u2019s biggest insurers, for what people familiar with the matter described as a probe into possible economic crimes.Although market reaction has been muted, a number of Chinese banks had already distanced themselves from Anbang, whose life insurance unit in May was barred from selling new products for three months, in what was seen as an attempt to keep any troubles there from spreading to other parts of the financial system.Regulators also tend to keep plenty of cash in the system in June, analysts say, due to a seasonal surge in demand due to corporate tax payments and regulatory requirements on banks\u2019 capital.The PBOC\u2019s move contrasts with its actions following the Fed\u2019s previous rate increase in March, when it responded by pushing up its own rates within hours. Analysts attributed that reaction to the bank\u2019s desire to discourage a further surge in money leaving the country, a danger if interest rates in the U.S. look much more attractive than at home.Since then, capital outflows have slowed, and analysts say Beijing\u2019s concerns have shifted to making sure its regulatory crackdowns don\u2019t endanger the economy and financial system.\u201cApart from the seasonal factors, the central bank\u2019s move today also shows it is adopting a milder approach to its effort to reduce financial leverage because the latter has already started to have a negative impact on the real economy,\u201d said       Tang Yue,        analyst at Industrial Securities.Beijing\u2019s campaign to tame highly leveraged investing began last summer and intensified in February and March when it twice raised a suite of key money-market interest rates. The move to clean up China\u2019s messy and risk-prone financial system has led to a sharp rise in borrowing costs in recent months: Yields on government bonds rose to a 29-month high last month and remain elevated, while a record number of companies have canceled or delayed new bond issuance.Mr. Tang also pointed to weaker credit data released Wednesday as fresh signs of difficulty: China\u2019s broadest measure of money supply, M2, was up 9.6% at the end of May from a year earlier, lower than the 10.5% increase at the end of April and below economists\u2019 median 10.4% growth forecast. It is the first time the M2 growth figure has fallen below 10% since the central bank first published the data in 1986, according to Wind Information.The return to liquidity tools such as short-term loans to commercial banks in money markets to adjust funding conditions, instead of following the Fed\u2019s footsteps, also betrays the central bank\u2019s concern about an already-tightening supply of cash triggering a liquidity crisis, said       Liu Dongliang,        senior analyst at             China Merchants Bank.June is typically a month when nervousness grips China\u2019s increasingly edgy interbank market as banks and financial institutions scramble for funds to meet needs ranging from corporate tax payment to mandatory deposits parked at the central bank. Loan defaults among a couple of medium-size banks led to an unprecedented cash crunch four years ago.In addition, an improvement in China\u2019s foreign reserves, signs of easing pressures on capital outflows and a stable currency gave Beijing option to refrain from raising interest rates this week, Mr. Liu said.Data released earlier this month showed that China\u2019s foreign-exchange reserves in May rose by the largest amount in more than three years, increasing by $24.03 billion from the previous month to $3.054 trillion\u2014the fourth straight month of gains.In a front-page commentary published on Friday, the state-run Securities Times attributed the PBOC\u2019s inaction to the better foreign-reserves data and reduced expectations of yuan depreciation.\u201cAll these have reduced the necessity for the PBOC to follow the Fed with a passive rate hike,\u201d the newspaper wrote in the commentary.Despite the PBOC\u2019s decision to stand pat this time, the gap between Chinese and U.S. market interest rates have widened sharply in recent months.The yield on the 10-year Chinese government bond is at 3.56%, a 1.4 percentage-point premium above that on the corresponding Treasury, up from just 0.62 percentage point in early August, before Beijing started the campaign to cut financial risk.\u201cThe interest-rate gap between China and the U.S. is wide enough, so there\u2019s no need for China to raise rates now,\u201d said Mr. Tang.Write to Shen Hong at hong.shen@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-16 07:03:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-central-bank-makes-largest-single-day-cash-injection-in-five-months-1497580814", "news_title": "China\u2019s Monetary Policy Zigs Where U.S. Zags", "keywords": " china funding squeeze,china money market operation,pboc, pboc cash injection,pboc intervention, pboc open-market operations,Federal Reserve,China's central bank,economic performance,indicators,money supply,monetary policy,economic news,money,currency markets,money markets,commodity,financial market news,banking,central banking,insurance,credit,financial services"}, {"content": "In 2013, at age 16, the singer-composer Lorde released \u201cPure Heroine,\u201d her debut full-length album.

Whereas \u201cPure Heroine\u201d was recorded in a small space in Auckland, \u201cMelodrama\u201d was made at a variety of studios in New York and Los Angeles.All of that suggests that Ms. Yelich-O\u2019Connor has succumbed, to some degree, to star-making machinery.

Other songs are undermined by overwrought arrangements ill-suited to Ms. Yelich-O\u2019Connor\u2019s evocative yet unextraordinary voice. Nuance is in short supply, but when restrained, the music works best, as when Mr. Antonoff\u2019s piano is the sole underpinning for the lovely \u201cLiability.\u201d But the single notes played on piano under the voice in \u201cWriter in the Dark\u201d move the song uncomfortably close to parody. The chugging guitar and echoes-of-Springsteen outro of \u201cThe Louvre\u201d seem like new turf for the singer-composer, but the track is betrayed by a mismatch between words and the melodic structure. \u201cHard Feelings/Loveless\u201d profits from the squeal and clanks of industrial sounds that rise from beats and synth strings.The good news is that \u201cMelodrama\u201d retains its predecessor\u2019s great strength as Lorde continues to document, with insight and refreshing transparency, how her life is progressing. It turns out that it hasn\u2019t been going all that well as far as romance is concerned. She seems to say here that what she feared could happen has: Life is chaotic; celebrity disrupts relationships; the highs of love don\u2019t compensate for the sense of loss when it goes; and sometimes even the gifted have to retreat to an empty home.She is aware such trials are fodder for great songwriting. \u201cBet you rue the day you kissed a writer,\u201d she sings in \u201cWriter in the Dark.\u201d In the coda of \u201cHard Feelings/Loveless,\u201d she speaks of revenge: \u201c\u2019Cause I\u2019m gonna mess your life up / Gonna wanna tape my mouth shut.\u201d But anger appears only in brief lightning-like flashes. Sadness and regret are the dominant emotions.When loneliness starts sinking in, Ms. Yelich-O\u2019Connor expresses a realization that she needs to care for herself. In \u201cLiability,\u201d she creates a devastating image: \u201cSo I guess I\u2019ll go home into the arms of the girl I love / The only love I haven\u2019t screwed up / We slow dance in the living room / But all that a stranger would see is one girl swaying alone.\u201d In \u201cPerfect Places,\u201d the album\u2019s closer, she sings of \u201cgraceless nights,\u201d adding: \u201cNow I can\u2019t stand to be alone.\u201dMs. Yelich-O\u2019Connor\u2019s lyrics don\u2019t quite compensate for the uninspired music, but they keep \u201cMelodrama\u201d from being a keen disappointment. At 20 years old and on the path to global stardom, she\u2019s made a step that\u2019s sideways at best. But lyricists of her caliber are to be held in kind regard and there is much to savor, even if listeners will have to fight against the sound to do so.\u2014Mr. Fusilli is the Journal\u2019s rock and pop music critic.

The bipartisan bill, which passed on a 98-2 vote, requires that the administration receive congressional approval to lift existing sanctions on Russia. It also broadens sanctions on the country\u2019s energy sector, mandates punishment of malicious cyber actors and crimps financing available to the Russian banking and energy industries. The result is the strongest rebuke yet from U.S. lawmakers to Moscow over Russia\u2019s alleged interference in the 2016 presidential campaign. The bill also represents a warning shot to the White House from the Senate, where lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have raised concerns the Trump administration isn\u2019t responding forcefully enough to Russia.Facebook is leaning more on artificial intelligence. Under intense political pressure to better block terrorist propaganda, the social-media giant said it has expanded its use of A.I. in recent months to identify potential terrorist postings\u2014and at times to delete or block them without review by a human. In the past,             Facebook                   and other tech companies relied mostly on users and human moderators to identify offensive content. Even when algorithms flagged content for removal, these companies generally turned to humans to make a final call. In response to a groundswell of criticism from governments and advertisers, Facebook disclosed new software that it says it is using to better police its content. One tool combs the site for known terrorist imagery to stop it from being reposted, while another set of algorithms attempts to identify propagandists and sometimes autonomously block them from opening new accounts after they have been kicked off the platform.This year is shaping up to be a dismal one for so-called quant funds, typically some of Wall Street\u2019s hottest investors. Over all, quantitative funds, which use sophisticated statistical models\u2014often developed by Ph.D.s\u2014rather than human research and intuition to find attractive trades, rose 1.44% this year through May. That compares with a gain of 8.7% for the S&P 500 index and a rise of 5.7% for the Vanguard Balanced Index Fund, which invests 60% in stocks and 40% in bonds. So far, though, the weakness hasn\u2019t stunted investor interest. Through the first quarter of the year, $4.6 billion of net new money was invested in quant funds, even as more than $10 billion was withdrawn from non-quant funds. Still, the disappointing recent performance raises questions among some investors about whether too much money is pursuing quant strategies and whether these funds are beginning to suffer as a result.Would anyone listen to a band called the Whom?

Haruhiko Kuroda       rejected Friday the idea that he should follow the Federal Reserve\u2019s lead and detail how the central bank might trim its assets, instead emphasizing the BOJ\u2019s continuing commitment to buy government debt.Mr. Kuroda was speaking after a decision by the bank earlier in the day to leave interest rates unchanged and maintain its promise to buy about \u00a580 trillion ($720 billion) of Japanese government bonds each year in light of continuing weakness in inflation.The decision to keep the rates on hold was widely expected, but some market participants had questioned whether the bank would stick to its bond-buying target, given that actual purchases of debt have fallen well below the promised pace.\u201cIt would only be meaningful to talk about an exit policy if we were at the stage of actually unwinding, but we are not there yet,\u201d he said, pointing to continuing weakness in Japanese prices. Core inflation in April was 0.3%, far from the bank\u2019s target of 2%.The governor was speaking two days after the Fed raised rates for the third time in six months, despite renewed softness in U.S. inflation. The Fed also gave more specifics on how it planned to cut its balance sheet.But for Japan\u2019s central bank chief, the lesson to be learned from the Fed dates back four years, not 48 hours.\u201cWhat the Fed is doing now is exactly the opposite of what it said it would do,\u201d he said, referring to guidance given by the U.S. central bank in May 2013. At that time, the Fed said it would gradually wind down its bond-buying program, triggering a plunge in asset prices and currencies around the world in an episode known as \u201cthe taper tantrum.\u201dSince the end of 2015, the Fed has raised interest rates while maintaining the size of its balance sheet.Market players would feel betrayed, Mr. Kuroda said, if the BOJ tightened in a way that differed from a path it had set out in advance.\u201cIt\u2019s not desirable to confuse markets by drawing up various scenarios,\u201d Mr. Kuroda said.The governor also hunkered down on the bank\u2019s commitment to buy bonds at \u00a580 trillion. While controlling short- and long-term interest rates has become the bank\u2019s principal policy tool since a revamp of its measures in September, the passage on its bond purchases is seen by investors as a symbolic gauge of the bank\u2019s commitment to its easing policy.He said the specific amounts of bond purchases could fluctuate around the guidance level of about \u00a580 trillion, depending on market conditions.Write to Megumi Fujikawa at megumi.fujikawa@wsj.com and Yoko Kubota at yoko.kubota@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-16 06:46:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/bank-of-japan-keeps-policy-on-hold-1497582128", "news_title": "Bank of Japan Holds Fire as It Faces Calls for Exit Strategy", "keywords": "bank of japan,bank of japan policy decision,boj,fed,federal reserve,haruhiko kuroda,interest rates,kuroda ,Federal Reserve,Bank of Japan,Haruhiko Kuroda,monetary policy,government finance,government borrowing,economic news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,debt,bond markets,commodity,financial market news,government debt,national government debt,banking,central banking,credit,financial services"}, {"content": "A major question hangs over the case of       Otto Warmbier,        the U.S. student who suffered a serious brain injury while imprisoned in North Korea: Did North Korea cause the coma?As doctors and relatives in the U.S. seek an answer, the experience of family members of Japanese citizens held captive in North Korea shows how difficult it can be to obtain reliable explanations from Pyongyang.Mr. Warmbier\u2019s father said in a Thursday news conference that he doesn\u2019t believe North Korea\u2019s explanation that his son slipped into a coma after contracting botulism and taking a sleeping pill. Doctors in the U.S. who examined the 22-year-old also said there was no evidence of botulism.The relatives of Japanese abducted by North Korea\u2014and Japanese government officials\u2014similarly dispute Pyongyang\u2019s accounts of their fates. In the 1970s and \u201980s North Korea abducted more than a dozen Japanese, many snatched from coastal areas by secret agents and whisked away by ship. Among them was 13-year-old Megumi Yokota, taken on her way home from school in northern Japan in late 1977.In 2004, North Korea told Japanese officials Ms. Yokota had committed suicide in 1994 and handed over what it said were her remains. DNA testing showed they belonged to other people.North Korea said seven other abductees had also died, including two from traffic accidents in a country with few cars and two from heart attacks while in their 20s. The regime said the remains of six had been washed away by rain.\u201cNorth Korea is a country that can\u2019t be trusted in the slightest,\u201d       Sakie Yokota,        the mother of       Megumi Yokota,        said in an interview. \u201cWe\u2019re glad he [Mr. Warmbier] was able to come home so soon when in our case so much time has passed.\u201dIt is unclear whether Mr. Warmbier will ever be able to explain what caused his injuries. Doctors say he suffered extensive loss of brain tissue and is in a state of \u201cunresponsive wakefulness.\u201dHis severe state is puzzling in part because few Westerners detained in North Korea in recent years have reported physical abuse. While detainees are typically made to perform manual labor, only U.S. missionary       Robert Park,        imprisoned by North Korea in 2009, publicly reported being tortured.U.S. officials may press North Korea for a new explanation of Mr. Warmbier\u2019s condition, as well as why he was held for more than a year a year while in a coma. History shows North Korea would likely seek political and economic benefits in exchange.Japan has held several rounds of talks with North Korea since 2002 to seek a full account of what happened to the abductees. In October 2002, five kidnap victims returned to Japan following a deal in which Tokyo provided Pyongyang with billions of dollars in aid, ostensibly to atone for its decadeslong occupation of North Korea, which ended in 1945.In 2014, the two sides agreed on a new comprehensive investigation of all Japanese nationals in North Korea, in return for Tokyo\u2019s lifting some sanctions on Pyongyang. But in 2016, North Korea canceled the probe, blaming fresh Japanese sanctions imposed after a North Korean missile test.The U.S. is seeking to increase pressure on North Korea over its nuclear and missile programs with tougher new sanctions.Secretary of State       Rex Tillerson       told a House panel this week that the U.S. is considering banning travel to North Korea but hadn\u2019t reached a decision.\u2014River Davis contributed to this article.Write to Alastair Gale at alastair.gale@wsj.comAppeared in the June 17, 2017, print edition as 'Doubts on Warmbier Case Echo Japan Abductees\u2019 Story.'", "news_time": "2017-06-16 06:44:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/north-korea-sent-otto-warmbier-home-in-a-coma-others-never-made-it-back-at-all-1497609846", "news_title": "North Korea Sent Otto Warmbier Home in a Coma.

The automotive parts supplier is facing an $850 million payment to car makers, as part of a settlement for a U.S. Justice Department criminal probe. Takata recorded a \u00a579.5 billion ($716 million) loss for the financial year that ended in March, and warned that its liabilities exceeded the value of its current assets.Car companies are covering the costs of recalling millions of vehicles across the world, including 42 million in the U.S. alone, that contain air bags linked to at least 16 deaths and more than 100 injuries. The companies say a Takata bankruptcy\u2019s impact on operations and balance sheets probably will be muted because they have had time to account for the damage.\u201cWe have enough parts to replace the recalled air bags,\u201d said a spokeswoman for Honda Motor Co., Takata\u2019s largest customer. Honda set aside \u00a5556 billion for recall-related costs over two years, fueling losses at a time when its peers were enjoying record profits from strong U.S. car sales and a weak yen.A Takata spokesman said the company doesn\u2019t have the capacity to produce parts to replace all the defective air bags.\u00a0\u201cWe are fulfilling the orders we receive from car makers every month,\u201d said a Takata spokesman.Honda has diversified its supplier base and air bags for its new vehicles no longer contain inflaters made by Takata\u2014the source of the problem in recalled air bags.Toyota Motor Corp.       said it is working with suppliers to ensure it has an adequate number of replacement parts. The company no longer uses the type of inflater that caused Takata air bags to explode, but it will continue to use Takata as a supplier \u201cif they comply with safety requirements,\u201d a spokesman for the company said.In May, Toyota,             Subaru Corp.       and             Mazda Motor Corp.      , along with             BMW AG      , reached a $550 million settlement with owners and lessees of vehicles with the defective air bags.Nissan                   said it is working on replacing the defective inflaters as quickly as possible, and is working with alternative suppliers to ensure it has enough to meet future demand.Much of the new business has flowed to             Autoliv Inc.       of Sweden. The company has won around half of all available air-bag inflater orders for the past two financial years, and it plans to deliver up to 30 million through 2018.Takata is in the midst of acquisition talks with smaller rival Key Safety Systems Inc., and that deal is expected to be announced at the same time as the bankruptcy\u2014although an agreement hasn\u2019t yet been reached.

The company\u2019s parent,             Inditex SA,        ITX 1.48%       saw an 18% surge in net profit in its recent quarter and a 14% jump in sales, a sharp contrast with the major retrenchment American companies including             Gap Inc.,       J. Crew Group Inc. and             Nordstrom Inc.       are undergoing as shopping patterns change. The streamlined production system that has allowed Zara to outpace rivals is now giving it a powerful platform to succeed online, the WSJ\u2019s Jeannette Neumann reports. The company makes 60% of its garments in Spain and nearby countries, gaining quick response on consumer trends and using Spain-based logistics centers that it leverages to constantly refresh its stores with small batches of new designs. The strategy has been a boon for its online business, feeding steady updates to web shoppers even as other retailers struggle to build a digital presence alongside traditional stores.Nike Inc.        NKE 0.21%       is trying to move faster. The sportswear giant is resetting its strategy to focus on key markets, digital sales and fewer products as it adjusts to online shopping trends that are changing the relationship between suppliers and traditional retail outlets. The WSJ\u2019s Sara Germano reports Nike has seen its future orders tumble in recent quarters as traditional sporting goods chains such as Sports Authority have stumbled. One immediate impact of the strategy: Nike will cut its global workforce by about 2%, or 1,000 jobs, retrenching for the first time since the recession. CEO       Mark Parker       says the company is now \u201cdelivering product faster than ever,\u201d and will speed things up even more. To do that, Nike will slash its styles by 25% to focus on its biggest franchises, which will help streamline operations at the front end of the company\u2019s sprawling global supply chain.U.S. grocers are coming under fresh pressure as consumers and discount rivals build new supply chains outside traditional distribution networks.

Consumers are shopping for more of their groceries outside of traditional supermarkets. Online merchants, discounters and meal-kit delivery services all are cutting into grocers\u2019 market share. Food and beverage sales at brick-and-mortar stores in the U.S. were down nearly $3 billion in the first quarter from a year earlier. And a new wave of discount grocers is pushing into the arena, with Germany-based chains Lidl and Aldi both investing heavily. With margins already thin and sales slowing, traditional grocers are trying to find a response in a market that\u2019s changing at a rapid pace.China\u2019s dominant hold on global rare earths supplies may soon extend into the U.S. A failed bidder for the Mountain Pass rare earths mine, the sole U.S. source of elements essential to electronics devices, says he\u2019ll challenge a bankruptcy auction that would deliver the mine to a buyout group backed by a Chinese company. With a bid of $20.5 million, two U.S. investment firms were selected to take control of Mountain Pass, along with China\u2019s Leshan Shenghe Rare Earth Shareholding Co., the WSJ\u2019s Peg Brickley reports.

The knock-on effects on the Chinese financial system could deepen the drama.The initial focus since Wu Xiaohui\u2019s detention has been on Anbang\u2019s insurance business. Chinese regulators have told banks to reduce their dealings with the company, The Wall Street Journal has reported: In recent days many have slowed their marketing of Anbang investment products.If customers of Anbang\u2014owner of New York\u2019s Waldorf Astoria hotel\u2014start surrendering their policies and stop buying new ones, that could accelerate a continuing cash drain at the company. China\u2019s insurance regulator has already been clamping down on the primary source of Anbang\u2019s cash since late last year\u2014short-term, high-yielding investment products disguised as insurance policies. Its premium income plunged 99% in April while its solvency ratio halved in the first quarter from the previous year.Some investors have already wised up to the broader problems if the cash Anbang has used for its global spending spree dries up. The bonds of Dutch insurer Vivat, which Anbang bought in 2015, plummeted on Thursday.But investors should also look hard at Anbang\u2019s assets at home. The company\u2019s tentacles reach far and deep into China\u2019s financial system, with one key route being its lending of short-term funds into Chinese money markets.Get financial insights and commentary on global investing from The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Heard on the Street team.

Anbang provides around 40% of the deposits for Chengdu Rural, and accounts for 80% of its related-party transactions, most of which are short-term, money-market loans. The bank also pays Anbang a high 5% interest on its deposits and holds some of Anbang\u2019s debt.Such tight relationships illustrate how financial stress at Anbang could quickly ripple through China\u2019s banking system. Banks like Chengdu Rural have already become increasingly reliant on short-term wholesale funding and have been resorting to capital raises: The loss of a big cash provider like Anbang could cause real pain. Interbank funding conditions are already tight in China\u2014the country\u2019s central bank made its biggest one-day cash injection into the market in nearly six months on Friday. If the detention of Anbang\u2019s chairman leads to the company stepping back more broadly from Chinese markets, the saga could have a while to run.Write to Anjani Trivedi at anjani.trivedi@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-16 05:58:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-anbang-could-clog-chinas-financial-plumbing-1497607114", "news_title": "How Anbang Could Clog China\u2019s Financial Plumbing", "keywords": "anbang,anbang chairman, anbang insurance,chengdu rural,china insurer,chinese insurance companies,insurance,waldorf astoria,wu xiaohui,Wu Xiaohui,marketing,markets,corporate,industrial news,commodity,financial market news,banking,commercial banking,credit,financial services"}, {"content": "Mining giant BHP has been losing a war of words with activist investor Elliott Management, which wants it out of American oil and an end to its underperformance against rival Rio Tinto.

In 2005, when he took over, its return on assets and equity were just 3% and 6%, respectively. When he left 10 years later, return on equity was running over 20% and return on assets had doubled.Part of that success was a no-nonsense approach to management: the new CEO replaced three-fourths of the firm\u2019s top 80 managers within two years. A bigger factor was arguably smart divestments and cheap acquisitions: Amcor\u2019s purchase of Alcan Packaging for $2 billion from Rio just after the financial crisis, followed by the demerger of an underperforming Australasian paper business, are widely viewed as key factors in the firm\u2019s recent success.Get financial insights and commentary on global investing from The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Heard on the Street team.

BHP\u2019s shale-oil assets would certainly find a buyer. But it\u2019s far from certain that this is a good point cyclically to go shopping for more iron, copper or other minerals. China, the main driver of metals demand, is poised to slow further and while investment in new supply has dropped since the height of the boom, it remains substantial.BHP\u2019s shareholders can expect Mr. MacKenzie to make a fair decision on the firm\u2019s oil strategy and the other issues raised by Elliott; the hedge fund added a statement of support shortly after the announcement.Making BHP\u2019s owners as happy as Amcor\u2019s, however, may prove a lot tougher.Write to Nathaniel Taplin at nathaniel.taplin@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-16 05:50:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/mackenzies-special-sauce-could-make-bhp-taste-better-1497606642", "news_title": "MacKenzie\u2019s Special Sauce Could Make BHP Taste Better", "keywords": "bhp, elliott, heard on the street, ken mackenzie, mining,Rio Tinto,RIO,BHP Billiton,BHP,commodity,financial market news,energy,metal ore mining,basic materials,resources,mining,quarrying"}, {"content": "Want proof taxes can actually go down? In the past three years, nine states have\u00a0eliminated or lowered their estate taxes, mostly by raising exemptions.And more reductions are coming.\u00a0Minnesota lawmakers recently raised the state\u2019s estate-tax exemption to $2.1 million retroactive to January, and the exemption will rise to $2.4 million next year. Maryland will raise its $3 million exemption to $4 million next year. New Jersey\u2019s exemption, which used to rank last at $675,000 a person, rose to $2 million a person this year.Next year, New Jersey is scheduled to eliminate its estate tax altogether, joining about a half-dozen others that have ended their estate taxes over the past decade.This tax-cutting trend has been fueled by competition between the states for affluent and wealthy taxpayers. Such residents owe income taxes every year, but some are willing to move out of state to avoid death duties that come only once. Since the federal estate-and-gift tax exemption jumped to $5 million in 2011, adjusted for inflation, state death duties have stood out.\u201cStates are under pressure to keep pace with both the federal estate-tax exemption and exemptions in neighboring states,\u201d says       Bruno Graziano,        a senior analyst with information services firm             Wolters Kluwer                   NV.Two\u00a0holdouts\u00a0remain: Massachusetts and Oregon. These two have estate-tax exemptions of $1 million or below, compared with nine that did in 2009.The tax bite is set to increase in each because neither adjusts its break for inflation.In Massachusetts, some lawmakers are worried about losing residents\u00a0to other states because of its estate tax, which brought in $400 million last year. They hope to raise the exemption to half the federal level and perhaps exclude the value of a residence as well.These measures stand a good chance of passage even as lawmakers are considering raising income taxes on millionaires, says       Kenneth Brier,        an estate lawyer with Brier & Ganz LLP in Needham, Mass., who tracks the issue for the Massachusetts Bar Association. State officials \u201care worried about a silent leak of people down to Florida, or even New Hampshire,\u201d he adds.The outlook is different in Oregon, according to       Mark McMullen,        the state\u2019s chief economist. No efforts to raise the exemption have gotten traction in the legislature, although estate-tax revenue of more than $200 million for the two-year cycle ending\u00a0June 30\u00a0is 50% higher than forecast, helped by strong housing and financial markets.\u201cWe don\u2019t see a lot of folks migrating out to avoid the estate tax,\u201d says Mr. McMullen.While most recent changes have been to state estate taxes, some states\u00a0with inheritance taxes are feeling pressure as well. Six states have these levies, which are payable by the person who inherits assets rather than the estate of the person who died. States can have\u00a0either\u00a0one of the taxes, or both.Inheritance tax rates and exemptions often vary according to the heir\u2019s relation to the decedent. In Nebraska, for example, there is no tax on assets left to a spouse, a top rate of 1% on assets left to lineal relatives or siblings, and a top rate of 18% on assets left to nonrelatives.Last year, lawmakers changed Pennsylvania\u2019s inheritance tax, which brought in $962\u00a0million\u00a0for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, so that family farms and businesses are exempt. The provisions were retroactive to 2012 for farm owners and 2013 for business owners.In Kentucky, Gov.       Matt Bevin       has called for repeal of the state\u2019s inheritance tax, which has rates up to 16%, while remaining open to other revenue increases.Two states, New Jersey and Maryland, have both estate and inheritance taxes. Although both have scaled back their estate tax, neither has cut the inheritance tax, according to Mr. Graziano.In New Jersey, the inheritance tax is typically far less important than the estate tax because it exempts lineal descendants, says       Samuel Weiner,        an attorney with Cole Schotz PC in Hackensack, N.J. Although the rate on amounts left to unrelated heirs is as high as 16%, \u201cPeople are just happy they\u2019re getting bequests,\u201d he adds. Maryland has generous exemptions to its inheritance tax as well.Write to Laura Saunders at laura.saunders@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-16 05:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-more-states-are-killing-death-taxes-1497605401", "news_title": "Why More States Are Killing Estate Taxes", "keywords": " death tax,estate tax, inheritance tax,state taxes,Kenneth Brier,Mark McMullen,Matt Bevin,Samuel Weiner,government finance,government budget,taxation,direct taxation,sub-national,local budget,economic news,property taxes,political,general news,estate planning,personal finance,tax strategies,advice"}, {"content": "Syrian civilians face rising peril and increasing casualties as the U.S.-led coalition ramps up its campaign to capture the Islamic State stronghold of Raqqa and militants try to hold on to their dwindling territory, according to the United Nations and groups that monitor the conflict.An estimated 200,000 people are trapped in Raqqa and at risk from airstrikes by the coalition. Those who want to try to escape the city must choose between crossing the Euphrates River, a frequent target of coalition airstrikes, or traversing minefields patrolled by Islamic State militants who have banned people from leaving, residents said.\u201cISIS didn\u2019t give us the freedom to leave the city,\u201d said an activist in Raqqa who works with an anti-Islamic State group, Raqqa24. \u201cPeople are mostly afraid of the airstrikes now and then secondly of ISIS.\u201dAn airstrike in Raqqa last week hit an internet cafe, killing at least 15 civilians, monitoring groups said. The civilians were trying to contact family outside the city or to get advice on how to flee Raqqa, according to activists and a relative of one of those killed.The coalition said it was investigating reports of civilian casualties in the strike. The coalition said it \u201croutinely conducts strikes on internet cafes used to spread ISIS propaganda and recruit foreign terrorists,\u201d and added, \u201cBased on intelligence and surveillance these strikes are conducted at a time when civilians are not assessed to be using the facilities.\u201dCivilians are also at risk southeast of Raqqa, including in Deir Ezzour province, where the coalition is bombing Islamic State and where the Syrian regime and its ally, Russia, are pursuing their own campaign against the militants.The regime and Russia have been responsible for the bulk of casualties in the six-year conflict, in which they are also fighting rebels opposed to the government of Syrian President       Bashar al-Assad,        according to most human-rights groups.Groups that monitor the conflict say that airstrikes by the U.S.-led coalition have killed hundreds of civilians in each of the past three months. The groups include Airwars, a U.K.-based nonprofit; the Syrian Network for Human Rights, which backs the opposition to the Syrian regime; and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, another opposition monitoring group, also based in the U.K.The U.S. military has dismissed many reports of civilian casualties as not credible and released much lower casualty figures. It has said the monitoring groups don\u2019t have access to the same information as the coalition, including airstrike logs and surveillance video.Coalition airstrikes have killed at least 300 civilians in Raqqa province since March, and are forcing people from their homes as the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces push deeper into Raqqa, Islamic State\u2019s de facto capital and the last major city it fully controls, U.N. investigators said Wednesday.\u201cThe intensification of airstrikes, which have paved the ground for an SDF advance in Raqqa, has resulted not only in staggering loss of civilian life but has also led to 160,000 civilians fleeing their homes and becoming internally displaced,\u201d said       Paulo S\u00e9rgio Pinheiro,        head of a U.N. commission on the Syria conflict.The U.N. warned last month that scant attention was being paid to the predicament of Syrian civilians trapped in Islamic State-controlled areas.\u201cThe same civilians who are suffering indiscriminate shelling and summary executions by [ISIS] are also falling victim to the escalating airstrikes,\u201d U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights       Zeid Ra\u2019ad Al Hussein       said.Defense Secretary       Jim Mattis       has said the U.S. tries to limit harm to civilians.\u201cCivilian casualties are a fact of life in this sort of situation,\u201d he said in an interview with CBS\u2019 Face The Nation. \u201cWe do everything humanly possible consistent with military necessity, taking many chances to avoid civilian casualties at all costs.\u201dResidents of Raqqa said escaping the city has become increasingly treacherous since the start of the battle to oust Islamic State last week. U.S.-backed forces have already captured at least two neighborhoods as fierce battles continue inside the city, according to an SDF spokesman and local activists.There are no humanitarian corridors, and both bridges spanning the Euphrates were severely damaged in earlier coalition bombings, residents said. Islamic State militants have publicly executed smugglers they caught helping people flee.A day before the offensive to recapture Raqqa began last week, more than a dozen civilians were killed by coalition strikes while crossing the Euphrates south of the city, according to groups that monitor the conflict.The coalition said it had carried out \u201cstrikes on ISIS fighters fleeing Raqqa on barges\u201d that day, and said it was investigating the allegations of civilian casualties. The coalition said it uses aerial surveillance to try to distinguish between civilians and militants.The coalition\u2019s offensive on Raqqa is turning the city into a battlefield, and Islamic State militants are girding to try to hold on to it.One Raqqa resident named several friends and neighbors who had been killed in recent days, deaths the resident said were due to airstrikes and artillery fire. \u201cThey were reduced to clumps of flesh that we had to bury in the park,\u201d the resident said.The anti-Islamic State group Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently said this week that since the battle for Raqqa began last week the coalition had bombed hospitals, mosques, schools and other municipal buildings. When Islamic State captured Raqqa in early 2014, it seized control of all municipal buildings, turning them into part of the bureaucracy of its self-declared caliphate.In recent days, residents and human rights groups have also reported the coalition using white phosphorus, an incendiary weapon.The coalition didn\u2019t confirm the use of white phosphorus in Syria, but said the weapon is generally used to hide troop movements from the enemy, and that it fully considers the potential harm to civilians.The use of incendiary weapons isn\u2019t banned, but international law prohibits its use in areas with heavy concentrations of civilians, even against military targets.Write to Raja Abdulrahim at raja.abdulrahim@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-16 05:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/civilian-casualties-mount-as-coalition-moves-to-oust-isis-in-raqqa-1497605412", "news_title": "Civilian Casualties Mount as Coalition Moves to Oust ISIS in Raqqa", "keywords": " civilian casualties, civilians, euphrates river, isil, isis, islamic state, raqqa,syria, syria conflict, un,political,general news,national,public security,crime,legal action,risk news,terrorism,military action"}, {"content": "Finance chiefs are still hoping for a U.S. tax overhaul within the next 12 months, but a fragmented attention span in Congress has many making mental adjustments to when a lower tax rate would actually materialize.Understanding the true potential for the most ambitious rewrite of the tax code since 1986 is a priority for the financial leaders. Any successful change will have implications for how CFOs allocate capital, select funding options and evaluate likely drivers of growth.\u201cThere\u2019s an expectation happening now that the U.S. will have a lower corporate tax rate,\u201d said       George Davis,        CFO of             Qualcomm Inc.,       at The Wall Street Journal\u2019s CFO Network Annual Meeting in Washington this week. \u201cTo the extent it doesn\u2019t, it would be a negative.\u201dPolicy makers speaking at the meeting put on an optimistic face for their audience of CFOs.\u201cWe\u2019re going to get tax reform, and I think we\u2019ll get it done this year,\u201d said Commerce Secretary       Wilbur Ross.       He added that a tax bill would come after a second attempt to pass a new health-care law. Republican leaders in Congress are also optimistic, but there are still significant intraparty divides over the content of the bill.In addition to a lower overall tax rate, CFOs said they want a path for bringing trapped foreign earnings home at tax rates lower than today\u2019s. CFOs also want Congress to rethink proposals such as introducing a border-adjusted tax and denying tax deductions for interest expenses. Still, like much of Washington, they disagree widely on what deductions they\u2019re willing to give up for the cuts.\u201cNo one will get everything they want,\u201d Mr. Davis said, adding that ultimately some elements of a bill \u201cwon\u2019t be attractive\u201d for all.Qualcomm\u2014like many multinationals\u2014is particularly invested in efforts to change the code to allow companies to repatriate their foreign earnings without paying hefty U.S. taxes on them. While most countries tax only the money companies earn inside their borders, the U.S. taxes profits that American companies make world-wide at 35%, minus any foreign taxes paid.The chip maker had $32.5 billion of earnings offshore at the end of last year. Under current law, Qualcomm can defer paying U.S. taxes on the earnings as long as it indefinitely reinvests the income overseas, leaving it trapped offshore.Foreign cash isn\u2019t the only point of concern. If today\u2019s overall 35% corporate tax rate drops, car-audio maker Harman International Industries Inc. could boost investments in the U.S., said       Sandy Rowland,        its finance chief.But the company, now a unit of             Samsung Electronics Co.      , doesn\u2019t favor Congress\u2019s plan to use a \u201cborder adjustment\u201d to pay for the reduction, Ms. Rowland said, during an interview on the sidelines of the two-day meeting. The proposal would end companies\u2019 ability to deduct import costs from their revenue and it would create a tax exemption for exports.Harman has manufacturing plants in Kentucky, Indiana and Washington state, but it also imports from factories abroad, including Mexico.Rep.       Kevin Brady       (R., Texas), chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, floated a five-year phase-in to the border-adjusted tax plan during an interview at the CFO Network meeting.Another proposal worrying some CFOs would reduce or eliminate businesses\u2019 ability to deduct interest payments from their income.\u201cIt\u2019s very critical for us,\u201d said             Duke Energy Corp.       finance chief       Steve Young.       The company had more than $48 billion of long-term debt on its books at the end of 2016, and paid $1.9 billion of interest. Duke would oppose any overhaul that excluded the interest deduction, even if it lowered the top rate, he said.The Charlotte, N.C., utility company borrows money to pay for long-term electrical grid and plant upgrades. If it couldn\u2019t deduct the interest on that debt, customers would pay more, he said.The ability of companies and individuals to deduct state taxes, including property taxes, from their federal obligations could hurt consumers, said       Peggy Smyth,        finance chief of             National Grid                   PLC\u2019s U.S. unit. The utility company\u2019s U.S. property tax bill is almost $1 billion a year.\u201cIf we are not getting a deduction [for property taxes], we could have to pass on the additional costs to our customers,\u201d Ms. Smyth said.Rep. Brady said utilities could get some targeted treatment as part of the plan. \u201cWe\u2019re also looking carefully at regulated utilities,\u201d he said.Defense contractor             Harris Corp.       wants existing debt to be exempt from interest rate deductibility rules, said CFO       Rahul Ghai.       Companies made the decision to take on debt under a different tax regime and with the assumption of certain benefits, he said. Harris made $183 million in interest payments on roughly $4 billion of debt during its last fiscal year, which ended in July.\u201cThe right thing to do is to make sure old interest is grandfathered irrespective of the future,\u201d Mr. Ghai said.Rep.\u00a0Brady backed the idea. \u201cMy current thinking is in the area that we grandfather existing debt in a generous way so that the financial arrangements that are currently in place stay there,\u201d he said.Any tax overhaul needs to be permanent if policy makers hope to see it lead to higher investment in factories and equipment, said       David Meline,        CFO of biotechnology company             Amgen Inc.       Current proposals depend on arcane Senate rules that would limit the revamp to 10 years before it expired. Mr. Brady wants a permanent policy, but some lawmakers are discussing temporary changes to comply with a law that allows expedited Senate passage but forbids increasing long-run budget deficits.Finance chiefs would have trouble justifying long-term investments under those conditions, because tax rates could jump back after a decade, Mr. Meline said.\u201cTen years is a short period,\u201d he said. \u201cBut temporary reform is better than no reform.\u201d\u2014Nina Trentmann and Richard Rubin contributed to this article.Write to Vipal Monga at vipal.monga@wsj.com and Tatyana Shumsky at tatyana.shumsky@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-16 05:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/for-cfos-tax-overhaul-is-a-leap-into-the-unknown-1497605408", "news_title": "For CFOs, Tax Overhaul Is a Leap Into the Unknown", "keywords": "cfo,cfo journal,cfos,Qualcomm,QCOM,regulation,government policy,corporate funding,corporate,industrial news,corporate taxation,government finance,government budget,taxation,economic news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,commerce department,executive branch,semiconductors,industrial electronics,industrial goods,technology"}, {"content": "Dan Ivascyn\u2019s       predecessor at Pacific Investment Management Co. was known as the \u201cbond king.\u201d But the firm\u2019s current investment chief\u00a0would rather be called\u00a0just about anything else.\u201cThere\u2019s a tendency to bestow royal terms on asset managers,\u201d he said at a recent conference. \u201cWe\u2019re much more like conductors of orchestras.\u201dMr. Ivascyn\u2019s ascension to the top of Pimco epitomizes the new direction taken by the California money manager as it recovers from the most tumultuous period in its history. He succeeded\u00a0      Bill\u00a0Gross,        the Pimco co-founder and bond market legend who exited in September 2014 after clashes with fellow executives.Hundreds of billions in client money followed Mr. Gross out of Pimco, which later faced a breach-of-contract lawsuit from its former star.\u00a0Pimco settled that suit for $81 million in March.Mr. Ivascyn was able to stop the outflows with a team of managers who oversee more than $1.5 trillion\u2014one of the largest asset pools anywhere in the world. Inflows have outnumbered defections for three straight quarters.As manager of Pimco\u2019s Income Fund, Mr. Ivascyn also attracted enough new money to claim the title of world\u2019s largest actively managed bond fund\u2014a perch long occupied by Mr.\u00a0Gross\u2019s\u00a0Total Return Fund. The Income Fund now manages more than $79 billion.\u201cHe is the perfect CIO for the Pimco we think of in the future,\u201d Pimco Chief Executive       Manny Roman       said\u00a0in an interview.\u00a0\u201cWhat we\u2019ve lost, and I would say it is a good thing, is the autocratic style.\u201dPimco\u2019s new CIO bears little resemblance to his predecessor. Mr. Gross was known inside Pimco for his outbursts, was a regular fixture on financial TV shows and occupied an extra-large desk at the center of the firm\u2019s trading floor. Mr. Ivascyn typically lets others speak first in meetings, rarely appears on TV and chose a desk no bigger than others. He ended Pimco\u2019s practice of reserving choice parking spots for key executives and, until recently, he drove a Toyota Prius to work.In another departure from the Gross era, Mr. Ivascyn relies more heavily on the expertise of individual portfolio managers to find profitable trades. Under Mr. Gross, managers\u00a0more closely followed\u00a0directives set by\u00a0broad investment calls.The son of a school superintendent and a nurse, Mr. Ivascyn grew up in a three-bedroom, 1,150 square-foot home in Oxford, Mass., a small town halfway between Boston and Springfield. His grandfather, an immigrant from Ukraine, had changed the family\u2019s surname from Ivaszczyszyn.He got his start in finance after graduating from Occidental College with stints at             T. Rowe Price Group Inc.,       Fidelity Investments and Bear Stearns Cos.\u2019 research department. Later, he earned a graduate degree in business from the University of Chicago.His career at Pimco nearly ended before it began.\u00a0It was the summer of 1998, and Mr. Ivascyn was\u00a0the newest trader\u00a0on the firm\u2019s mortgage desk.\u00a0A week into his new job, hedge fund Long Term Capital Management\u2019s implosion roiled markets around the world.Mr. Ivascyn, who had never traded anything before, struggled to keep up with the chaos. Pimco pulled him from the mortgage desk and\u00a0exiled\u00a0him to the opposite end of the same floor, where he\u00a0sometimes\u00a0sat alone. Colleagues encouraged him to send out his r\u00e9sum\u00e9, people familiar with the matter said.\u201cThe kid is not working out,\u201d one portfolio manager told then-Pimco mortgage boss       Scott Simon.      \u00a0\u201cHe\u2019s not a great fit.\u201dHe survived this rocky start after Mr. Simon\u00a0argued that Mr. Ivascyn hadn\u2019t been given a fair shot. But it was the 2008 financial crisis that made him a star within Pimco.He had just taken over a new mutual fund, launched with little fanfare, that sought to meet retail investors\u2019 appetite for steady income from bonds. Several other senior Pimco officials turned down the chance to manage the Income Fund because it veered from Mr. Gross\u2019s Total Return strategy.But in early 2008, Mr. Ivascyn\u00a0directed a team of temps to scour the offering documents of scores of bonds linked to souring mortgages. The research helped Pimco determine which bonds were more or less likely to meet their obligations to investors.The analysis helped Pimco weather the downturn. And in the years that followed the crisis, it gave Mr. Ivascyn the confidence to invest heavily in bonds that stood to snap back in value as the economy stabilized. The Income Fund, now co-managed with Alfred Murata, was a prime beneficiary of those trades.\u201cIt allowed us to go on the offensive pretty quickly,\u201d Mr. Ivascyn said.But Mr. Ivascyn wasn\u2019t immune to the strain that developed inside Pimco as Mr. Gross\u2019s\u00a0relationships with fellow executives deteriorated.Mr. Gross said in his lawsuit\u00a0that his Pimco career\u00a0reached a breaking point when Mr. Ivascyn and other managing directors threatened to resign. He said in the suit that Mr. Ivascyn, who was named as a deputy CIO in 2013, was \u201cforemost\u201d among the individuals who sought to oust him as a way of collecting his share of the bonus pool.Mr. Ivascyn declined to comment about his interactions with\u00a0Mr. Gross.\u00a0Pimco officials have disputed Mr. Gross\u2019s allegations.Unnerved by the potential loss of Mr. Ivascyn and other key employees, Pimco parent             Allianz        ALIZF 0.53%       intended to fire Mr. Gross. Mr. Gross quit on\u00a0Sept. 26. 2014, and hours later Pimco named Mr. Ivascyn as the firm\u2019s next CIO.\u2014Sarah Krouse contributed to this articleWrite to Justin Baer at justin.baer@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-16 05:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/pimcos-new-bond-king-is-nothing-like-bill-gross-1497605409", "news_title": "Pimco\u2019s New Bond King Is Nothing Like Bill Gross", "keywords": " bill gross,bond fund, cio,income fund, investment chief,pimco, total return fund,Pacific Investment Management,Allianz SE,ALV.XE,XE:ALV,Bill\u00a0Gross,Dan Ivascyn,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,fixed income investing,personal investments in bonds,personal finance,personal investments,financial investments,portfolio,fund,asset management,financial services,investing,securities"}, {"content": "Friction between the U.S. and Mexico over trade is starting to cut into sales for U.S. farmers and agricultural companies, adding uncertainty for an industry struggling with low commodity prices and excess supply.Over the first four months of 2017, Mexican imports of U.S. soybean meal\u2014used to feed poultry and livestock\u2014dropped 15%, the first decrease for the period in four years, according to data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Shipments of U.S. chicken meat fell 11%, the biggest decline for the period since 2003. U.S. corn exports to Mexico declined 6%. Mexico is the largest U.S. export market for those commodities.The numbers reflect how Mexican companies are now increasingly buying grain on a short-term basis and purchasing more chicken from Brazil, troubling some industry officials and analysts. The trade data, which is the latest available, indicates that Mexico is starting to follow through on aspirations to buy food from a wider range of countries, and reduce reliance on the U.S.\u201cWe have to send a signal to policy makers in Washington, and emphasize that we are not sitting still,\u201d said       Ra\u00fal Urteaga Trani,        head of international affairs for Mexico\u2019s Secretariat of Agriculture, who last month shepherded officials from 17 Mexican companies on a trade mission to South America, focused on corn, soybeans and wheat.Mexico ranks as the third-largest customer for U.S.-produced farm goods overall, accounting for $18 billion in trade last year, and the U.S. is Mexico\u2019s biggest market for food, making for a close-knit trade relationship that has built up around the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement. That agreement is expected to be renegotiated in August by the Trump administration. Beginning on the campaign trail, President Donald Trump claimed Mexico had siphoned jobs, investment and wealth from the U.S. through the deal.Mexico\u2019s declining purchases of some commodities runs counter to the Trump administration\u2019s goal to boost U.S. exports generally.U.S. Agriculture Secretary       Sonny Perdue       has been working to build bridges to Mexico. In May he initiated a call with his Mexican counterpart,       Jos\u00e9 Calzada Rovirosa,        that centered on mutually beneficial trade, and Mr. Perdue has invited Mr. Calzada to a two-day meeting in the coming week in Savannah, Ga., where trade is expected to be discussed. Canada\u2019s agriculture minister,       Lawrence MacAulay,        is also expected to attend, along with U.S. business leaders.Economic and financial conditions can quickly alter trading patterns. The Mexican peso has weakened against the dollar in recent months, making some U.S. products more expensive and Brazilian chicken more attractive to some Mexican buyers.And while U.S. sales of some crops and meat to Mexico have slowed, the country is buying more U.S. beef and eggs, USDA data for the first four months of the year show.Still, some U.S. agriculture officials worry that the uncertainly around trade could jeopardize a market that last year bought roughly 13% of total U.S. agricultural exports, at a time American farmers are struggling with low prices. Last week, the U.S. Grains Council, a trade body focused on developing grain exports, dispatched its board of directors to Mexico to emphasize U.S. crop producers\u2019 commitment to the country.\u201cCertainly, we\u2019re concerned,\u201d said       Tom Sleight,        the group\u2019s chief executive, who has made multiple visits to Mexico since February. \u201cThere\u2019s a palpable interest on the part of Mexico\u2014I\u2019ve heard it referred to as \u2019Plan B\u2019 consistently by the Mexican folks\u2014to reduce dependence on the U.S., in agricultural commodities, and source those elsewhere.\u201dConcerns have arisen in the U.S. poultry sector that the jousting over U.S.-Mexico trade policy could drive Mexican buyers toward Brazilian meatpackers, which have seized on a 2013 move by Mexico\u2019s government to allow duty-free poultry-meat imports from that country and others. Brazilian chicken sales to Mexico surged to 52,800 metric tons last year from 387 metric tons in 2013, according to the U.S. Poultry and Egg Export Council, and Brazil has further increased its poultry exports to Mexico this year.\u201cThey\u2019re trying to send a message to the [poultry] producers in the U.S.,\u201d said       Jeremy Scott,        analyst with Mizuho Securities USA LLC. But due to its proximity, he said, \u201cthe lowest-cost chicken for Mexico is always going to be in the U.S.\u201dMr. Sleight of the U.S. Grains Council also said Mexican cattle ranchers and hog farmers may be placing fewer long-term orders for U.S. grain partly because ample supplies mean that prices aren\u2019t likely to jump significantly. Yet a shift toward short-term buying also reflects Mexican purchasers\u2019 uncertainty around trade relations with the U.S. ahead of the Nafta renegotiation, he said.\u201cThere\u2019s some anxiety on all sides,\u201d the USDA\u2019s Mr. Perdue said in a press briefing this month. But he added that Mexico\u2019s outreach to South American suppliers may be \u201ca negotiation strategy to let the United States know there are other alternatives.\u201dU.S. farmers and agribusinesses still have the capability to quickly deliver grain and meat to Mexico at cheap rates, and South American competitors, which rely on oceangoing vessels, could find that hard to replicate. \u201cNobody can do it better, nobody can do it safer, and nobody can do it more logistically friendly than the U.S., and Mexico knows that,\u201d said Mr. Perdue.Mexico\u2019s Mr. Urteaga said that last month\u2019s visit to Brazil and Argentina showed that those countries\u2019 grain can compete on price with U.S. crops. A 25,000-ton shipment of Argentine wheat booked on that trip is due to arrive on Mexico\u2019s shores within the next two months, he said.Mexico values its close ties to the U.S. on food trade, and doesn\u2019t want to abandon those, Mr. Urteaga said. \u201cBut it is true, there is also some sense of wariness when all these companies hear or read in the media that the Nafta trade talks may not go the way everybody is expecting.\u201dWrite to Jacob Bunge at jacob.bunge@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-16 05:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-exports-to-mexico-fall-as-uncertainty-over-nafta-lingers-1497605414", "news_title": "U.S. Exports to Mexico Fall as Uncertainty Over Nafta Lingers ", "keywords": "U.S. Department of Agriculture,Mizuho Securities,8411.TO,Jeremy Scott,Ra\u00fal Urteaga Trani,Tom Sleight,Jose Calzada Rovirosa,Lawrence MacAulay,financial performance,earnings,sales figures,marketing,markets,corporate,industry exports,industrial news,trade,external payments,physical trade,economic news,political,general news,international relations,politics,agriculture,farming,poultry farming,food,beverages,tobacco,animal slaughtering,processing,poultry processing,consumer goods,food products,livestock farming"}, {"content": "MIDLAND, Texas\u2014For       Bruce Niemeyer,        the             Chevron Corp.        CVX 0.71%       executive overseeing the company\u2019s $15 billion expansion here, one question looms above all: Will we make money?Big oil companies including Chevron,             Exxon Mobil Corp.       and             Royal Dutch Shell                   PLC are piling into the Permian Basin, the oil-rich region straddling Texas and New Mexico that is the epicenter of the second wave of U.S. shale drilling.Chevron and others say they will soon achieve something that has proven surprisingly elusive for their smaller peers: turning a profit. The shale-drilling renaissance rocked global markets and helped send crude prices into a prolonged slump. What it didn\u2019t do was bring in much cash. Since 2011, the largest 30 independent U.S. shale producers spent an average of nearly $1.33 for every $1 they made drilling wells, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis.In the past two years, those 30\u00a0have lost $130 billion. More than 120 companies have gone bankrupt, and many of those that survived have done so with cash infusions from Wall Street, which rewarded the drillers for their fast growth.That model won\u2019t work for Chevron, Exxon and other companies who pay shareholders generous dividends and need to bring in more cash than they spend over time. To transform an important\u2014yet money-losing\u2014technology into a source of profit, executives like Mr. Niemeyer, the head of Chevron\u2019s midcontinent business, are turning to their strengths.Those include massive scale, deep pockets that have given them time to learn from the successes and failures of others and an ability to bring techniques used all over the world into West Texas. They are joining the race to push crude production here to 4 million barrels a day within a decade, rivaling the output of Iraq.\u201cThe early stages favored the smaller companies, which could test technology and try different things,\u201d said Anish Kapadia, an analyst at Tudor Pickering Holt & Co., an energy investment bank in Houston. \u201cAs they move into development mode, those with a low cost of capital will have an advantage. This is the domain\u201d of large oil companies, he added.The big companies face considerable skepticism from investors who don\u2019t see how they can meet growth targets and generate excess cash by exploiting shale fields. In recent years, Exxon, Chevron and Shell have lagged behind top operators in the Permian basin by a wide margin, with the big companies\u2019 individual wells producing about half as much oil and gas in some cases, analysts say.Executives at the biggest companies counter that these results reflect, in part, a focus on drilling practices that bolster output over the life of the well, rather than maximize short-term flows.\u201cBig oil companies are basically lethargic, slow-moving giants,\u201d said David Arrington, a Midland-based entrepreneur who has drilled wells in Texas for decades.But last year, the big companies showed signs of narrowing the gap, embracing techniques pioneered by smaller companies such as drilling longer wells horizontally and using more sand to prop open rock layers and let oil flow. Within a decade, Chevron estimates it may produce as much as 700,000 barrels a day in the Permian, an amount that would exceed the total current output in the U.K.\u2019s portion of the North Sea. Last year, Chevron\u2019s output in the Permian averaged 175,000 barrels a day.Chevron hasn\u2019t disclosed how much it will boost spending in the area over the next 10 years, but analysts say it is likely to exceed $15 billion.\u201cNobody remembers who was winning the Indianapolis 500 after the first 100 miles,\u201d says Mr. Niemeyer, 55 years old. \u201cHow you start is interesting, but it\u2019s far more important how you finish.\u201dChevron is widely acknowledged as having the most valuable Permian position among giant oil companies, with access to land roughly double the size of Yosemite National Park. The land\u2014some of which the company has held since 1920\u2014may hold as much as 18 billion barrels of oil and gas, according to Tudor Pickering.Exxon in January doubled its potential reserves in the region\u00a0in a deal worth up to $6.6 billion.\u00a0From next year through 2020, about half the $50 billion or more the company plans to spend in\u00a0its production business will go to the Permian, North Dakota and other areas that can pay off in a short period.Beginning in the 1920s, the Permian was once a land of abundant gushers. But in the past two decades, many companies pulled out because they believed its resources had largely been exhausted. Chevron didn\u2019t.In 2010 and 2011, a handful of small producers saw surprisingly promising results when they tested horizontal drilling and other techniques. It was then that Chevron began to entertain the notion that it could be sitting on an immense prize.Initially, the company moved slowly to develop its position, wanting to maximize a key advantage over others: Chevron either owns outright or controls the mineral rights on about 85% of its 1.5 million acres in West Texas and New Mexico. That allows Chevron the luxury of developing the reserves in a way it finds most cost effective, rather than in the mad rush typified by companies that have to drill quickly or lose their lease.A few years ago, Chevron began working with top operators in the region, even allowing some of them to drill on its land. By observing close-up the work of companies like Pioneer Natural Resources Inc., Chevron was able to learn without costly experimentation of its own.Chevron has brought its production costs in the Permian Basin down 30% since 2015 to below $20 a barrel. It says its operations will generate free cash flow by 2020, far faster than typical big oil projects.\u201cThe market may be underestimating the ability of these companies to change or adapt,\u201d said John Dowd, portfolio manager of the Fidelity Select Energy Fund, which holds about $2 billion in energy assets.Write to Bradley Olson at Bradley.Olson@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-16 05:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/big-oil-firms-are-exploring-a-new-frontier-in-shale-profits-1497605411", "news_title": "Big Oil Firms Are Exploring a New Frontier in Shale: Profits ", "keywords": "brent,nymex,oil prices,permian,permian basin,shale,shale boom,shale oil,west texas,Chevron,CVX,Exxon Mobil,XOM,Royal Dutch Shell,RDSB.LN,RDSA.LN,financial performance,earnings,corporate,industrial news,energy,crude oil,natural gas upstream operations,oil exploration,crude petroleum extraction,natural gas,oil extraction,integrated oil,gas,oil sands"}, {"content": "U.S. congressional investigators want to know what an ex-CIA operative was doing in Montenegro last fall at the time of an alleged Russian-backed coup plot against NATO\u2019s newest member.Former\u00a0Central Intelligence\u00a0Agency\u200eofficer Joseph Assad is celebrated in Washington for helping extract dozens of Iraqi Christians from Islamic State territory\u00a0in 2015\u200e.\u00a0Last October, days before a hotly contested national election in Montenegro, Mr. Assad flew to the tiny Balkan country that has been the subject of tensions between the U.S. and Russia.Why Mr. Assad went is a focus of an espionage trial in Montenegro\u2014and now a congressional inquiry in Washington.The imbroglio is a sign that old East-versus-West spy games are alive again in Europe.

But eurozone growth has outpaced that of the U.S. this year, and U.S. firms with exposure to Europe have started to profit from the region\u2019s brightening outlook.It is a trend many analysts expect to continue.U.S. stocks closely tied to the European economy have outperformed those with looser connections to Europe this year, according to an analysis by equity strategists at UBS who track a basket of stocks with elevated European exposure.Early signs of a pickup in Europe\u2019s economy are creeping into U.S. earnings. The number of companies in the Dow Jones Industrial Average reporting quarterly sales growth in Europe is the highest since 2014, according to FactSet.\u201cA healthier, stronger-growing European economy will benefit U.S. companies that are exposed to that,\u201d particularly exporters with end markets in the Continent, said       Christopher Dyer,        director of global equity at Eaton Vance.The eurozone economy grew at an annualized rate of 2.3% in the first three months of 2017, its fastest rate in two years. That compares with a rate of 1.2% in the U.S., although many economists predict faster growth in subsequent quarters. Business surveys and industrial-production figures suggest that quicker pace of growth in Europe has continued into the second quarter.Political risks in Europe, associated with a string of elections, were expected to damp growth and consumer confidence. That didn\u2019t happen.Meanwhile, hopes for tax cuts in the U.S. have dimmed, which has put a dent in smaller stocks more reliant on the U.S. market.The primary beneficiaries of a stronger Europe are eurozone equities, with shares climbing around 10% this year amid 11 consecutive weeks of investor inflows.Allocation to eurozone stocks remains near two-year highs, according to fund managers surveyed by Bank of America Merrill Lynch, as investors continue to bet on sustained strength in the region\u2019s growth and inflation outlook.But a broad list of U.S. companies, including those involved in software and services, household and personal products and pharmaceuticals, also benefit from greater ties to Europe, said       Julian Emanuel,        strategist at UBS.While many investors have tried to capitalize on European growth by sending money directly into European equities, some might not want to take on the currency risk, Mr. Emanuel said. Those investors might prefer companies they are more familiar with, he said. As well, many of the companies most tied to Europe are household names that also stand to benefit from any potential tax-repatriation policy.It can be difficult to calculate eurozone sales because of the different ways companies report, but shares of some companies with heavy European exposure are already taking off.Shares of online travel company             Priceline Group,       which generates 76% of revenue from Europe, according to FactSet, are up 23% this year. Shares of tobacco giant             Philip Morris International Inc.,       which gets 42% of revenue from Europe, are up 32%. That compares with an 9.7% rise for the S&P 500 so far this year.U.S. companies also could potentially benefit from higher business expenditures in Europe\u2014not just more consumer spending.European companies tend to invest in productivity as the economy improves, said       Michael Thompson,        managing director at S&P Global Market Intelligence. \u201cA lot of European companies are very focused on improving margins,\u201d Mr. Thompson said. \u201cMargin improvement in Europe is code for \u2018tech buy.\u2019\u201dCompanies based in the U.S. with global operations have broadly outperformed domestically focused U.S. firms in the first quarter, partly because of a pickup in emerging markets and a weaker dollar. The Commerce Department said that what it calls rest-of-the-world profits rose 25% in the first quarter from a year earlier, significantly outpacing those generated in the U.S.\u201cCompanies with exposure to the international consumer have outperformed, and I don\u2019t see any reason for a slowdown,\u201d said       Melda Mergen,        head of equities at Columbia Threadneedle Investments.Write to Riva Gold at riva.gold@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-06-16 05:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-firmsand-their-sharesreap-benefits-of-europes-revival-1497605402", "news_title": "U.S. Firms\u2014and Their Shares\u2014Reap Benefits of Europe\u2019s Revival ", "keywords": "dow industrials,euro,european equities,european stocks,eurostoxx,eurozone,eurozone economy,eurozone growth,u.s. stock futures,Christopher Dyer,Melda Mergen,Michael Thompson,Julian Emanuel,financial performance,earnings,sales figures,corporate,industrial news,economic performance,indicators,economic growth,euro zone,currency,economic news,equity markets,commodity,financial market news"}, {"content": "After years of runnin\u2019 against the wind of 21st century music technology, culture and business,       Bob Seger       has gone digital. At midnight Friday, a dozen of the \u201cOld Time Rock & Roll\u201d singer\u2019s biggest albums were finally released for downloads and streaming.Though not all his albums were set loose, the initial release encompasses his core catalog, including the 1968 debut \u201cRamblin\u2019 Gamblin\u2019 Man,\u201d as well as \u201cLive Bullet,\u201d the 1976 breakout album with his Silver Bullet Band, and his 1994 \u201cGreatest Hits\u201d collection, which recently passed the sales milestone of 10 million units.Mr. Seger, who in one hit sang about standing \u201clike a rock\u201d against \u201chustlers and their schemes,\u201d was the last major digital holdout from the classic rock generation. He opted out of             Apple\u2019s       iTunes download store even after noted absentees like the Beatles, Led Zeppelin and AC/DC came off the sidelines. He passed on newer platforms such as Spotify, too, even as streaming music eclipsed downloads in popularity.However, he acknowledged that his reliance on compact discs would likely cause a hit to his legacy and cost him new fans. \u201cI\u2019m way missing out. If I do a new song that reminds people of an old one, they can\u2019t follow it back\u201d to earlier releases, he said in a 2014 interview with The Wall Street Journal. He predicted that the digital release would happen eventually, adding, \u201dI hope it\u2019s not too late.\u201dSitting out the digital music revolution almost seemed fitting for a low-key, Detroit-area star with a reputation for being allergic to musical trends. The digital blackout stemmed from a long-running standoff between Mr. Seger\u2019s managers and his record label, Capitol, over the proposed split of digital revenues, he said.The disagreement centered on \u201chow much they\u2019re supposed to pay for new technology. It was in a previous contract, black and white,\u201d Mr. Seger told the Journal in 2014. \u201cI guess [the terms] were too generous. But they don\u2019t want other artists to go crazy if they don\u2019t get the same rights.\u201dAhead of the digital release, Mr. Seger\u2019s management company declined to comment on his explanation for the delay, and said \u201cwe\u2019re pleased to move forward\u201d with Capitol and Universal Music Enterprises, which oversees releases from the back catalog within Universal Music Group.After the Beatles hit Spotify in late 2015, pent-up demand propelled their songs to the top of the streaming site\u2019s charts, at least temporarily. For Mr. Seger, a staple of classic rock radio (who hasn\u2019t toured outside the North America since 1980), it is unclear how widely his digital debut will resonate on a platform dominated by hip-hop and pop.Mr. Seger isn\u2019t giving up on traditional methods of getting music to the masses.

INTC 0.09%       in 2009.Under EU rules, the fine could reach as high as 10% of the company\u2019s annual revenue, which was $90.27 billion last year.Google faces additional, and perhaps more painful, consequences from the European Commission\u2019s action, including possible changes not only to its handling of its shopping service but other services as well.\u00a0The antitrust watchdog\u2019s decision could also embolden private litigants to seek compensation for damages at national courts.The EU is likely to instruct Google to put its comparison shopping service on equal footing with those of its competitors, such as\u00a0Foundem.co.uk\u00a0and Kelkoo.com Ltd. Such companies rely on traffic coming to their site from search engines like Google\u2019s, and the equal-treatment requirement could lead to greater visibility for rival services on the tech giant\u2019s platform.The EU has been in talks with some of the complainants about how Google should change its search results, though the precise remedy would likely be hammered out only after a decision is announced.Google general counsel       Kent Walker       has previously argued that forcing the company to place competitors\u2019 product ads in its search results \u201cwould just subsidize sites that have become less useful for consumers.\u201dThe regulator\u2019s move would come as welcome relief to a range of web companies\u2014large and small, European and American\u2014that have been urging the EU for years to take antitrust action against Google.\u00a0            News Corp,       owner of The Wall Street Journal, has formally complained to the EU about Google\u2019s handling of news articles on its search service.The EU watchdog opened its investigation into Google\u2019s practices in 2010. The former competition commissioner,       Joaqu\u00edn Almunia,        subsequently drafted various settlements with Google over more than two years of talks, but the steps offered by Google were rejected in 2014 following criticism from competitors, as well as from politicians in Germany and France.That led the way for Mr. Almunia\u2019s successor, current EU antitrust chief       Margrethe Vestager,        to file formal accusations against Google\u2014the first regulator in the world to do so\u2014by issuing a so-called statement of objections in the comparison shopping case in April 2015.An EU decision against Google would set the regulator apart from authorities in the U.S.; they closed their own investigation into Google\u2019s search practices in 2013 after the company agreed to voluntary changes. The divergence could reflect in part Google\u2019s greater presence in search on the continent, where it holds about 90% of the market.Google can appeal any decision by the European Commission in the shopping case to the bloc\u2019s top courts in Luxembourg, dragging out the legal battle as a final ruling could take years.A decision in the case could set precedents for how the U.S. technology company operates in other domains, including with its local and travel services\u2014areas the EU has also been investigating. Meanwhile, EU antitrust cases against Google over its Android mobile-operating service and its advertising service Adsense remain open.Write to Natalia Drozdiak at natalia.drozdiak@wsj.comAppeared in the June 17, 2017, print edition as 'Google Faces EU Antitrust Fine.'", "news_time": "2017-06-16 04:50:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-faces-record-european-antitrust-fine-1497602658", "news_title": "Google Faces Record EU Antitrust Fine ", "keywords": " alphabet, antitrust, competition watchdog,eu competition commissioner,google, google faces record antitrust penalty in europe, kelkoo, online price comparison, vestager,Alphabet Inc.

BHP 0.96%       has turned to a packaging-industry veteran to head its board, appointing director       Ken MacKenzie       to succeed       Jac Nasser       when he retires after seven years as chairman.The appointment puts Mr. MacKenzie in the firing line as BHP faces criticism from activist investors over its underperformance and accusations long-serving directors stood by while billions of dollars were misspent on acquisitions and mistimed share buybacks. New York hedge fund Elliott Management Corp. has led a series of attacks in recent months, calling for a sweeping overhaul of the world\u2019s largest listed mining company.Mr. MacKenzie will assume the role in September, one year after he joined the company\u2019s board as a nonexecutive director.Analysts and shareholders said he was likely viewed as a clean slate within BHP. Elliott in response said it supported the appointment as a first step in bringing much-needed change to the direction of the company.BHP said the selection had been made after a rigorous search and assessment of potential external and internal candidates, with the assistance of international recruitment firm             Heidrick & Struggles.\u201cKen MacKenzie brings extensive global executive experience and a strategic approach. He has a proven record of delivering value for shareholders,\u201d said Shriti Vadera, a director who led the succession process.In a statement, Mr. MacKenzie said he planned to meet with shareholders and other individuals in the coming weeks to understand their perspectives. \u201cI am committed to the creation of long-term value for all of our shareholders and will work tirelessly with the board and management to achieve this,\u201d he said.The directors voted on Mr. Nasser\u2019s successor during meetings in the Chilean capital of Santiago. Mr. MacKenzie and the rest of the board weren\u2019t available to comment, BHP said.The former managing director and chief executive of             Amcor Ltd.       was the obvious choice among the rumored candidates since he was a relatively fresh face on BHP\u2019s board, said       Brenton Saunders,        a portfolio manager at             BT Investment Management                   in Sydney. It marks a \u201cchanging of the guard\u201d that should make it easier for BHP to review its legacy assets, particularly the oil-and-gas operations that some investors have questioned as an ill fit alongside iron-ore, copper and other mining businesses, he said.BHP has been dragged into a public spat with Elliott that has drawn out criticism from other investors, including Sydney hedge fund Tribeca Investment Partners.In its latest attack, Elliott earlier this week urged BHP to appoint a strong, experienced chairman with a mandate to refresh a board it accused of allowing shareholder value to be wasted by approving the acquisition of shale-oil and gas assets and poorly timed share buybacks that were at the root of BHP\u2019s share underperformance over many years against the Australian benchmark stock index and rival             Rio Tinto                   PLC.Before that, Tribeca said it had been holding private talks with a number of possible candidates for BHP\u2019s board and has pushed for BHP to sell its U.S. oil-and-gas assets.Elliott, which has almost US$33 billion in assets under management, said it encouraged Mr. MacKenzie to address BHP\u2019s capital allocation and underperformance, nominate diverse and experienced directors and review the executive management team. It also renewed its calls for an independent review of the petroleum division and a collapse of the dual-listed structure.\u201cAs CEO of Amcor, Mr. MacKenzie displayed strong leadership qualities as he successfully navigated the company through the financial crisis while making difficult decisions to significantly improve shareholder returns over his decade at the helm,\u201d Elliott said.\u2018Ken MacKenzie brings extensive global executive experience and a strategic approach.\u2019Mr. MacKenzie, 53 years old, had a 23-year career with Australia\u2019s Amcor and was managing director and CEO from 2005 to 2015. He oversaw more than 30 acquisitions during a period of consolidation for the packaging industry that more than doubled Amcor\u2019s market value to about $12.5 billion and widened its global footprint. He also oversaw the 2013 spinoff of the domestic Australian and New Zealand assets into             Orora Ltd.Mr. Nasser in a statement said Mr. MacKenzie was an excellent choice to lead the board.A former president and chief executive of Ford Motor Co., Mr. Nasser joined BHP\u2019s board in mid-2006 and took over as chairman in 2010. His predecessor, Don Argus, was also on BHP\u2019s board for several years before becoming chairman.Mr. Nasser guided the company through a tumultuous period, marked by the height of the global commodities boom and a more recent collapse that prompted deep cost-cutting and a slashing of dividend payouts. While he was chairman, the company has steadily ramped up its production of commodities including iron ore and copper, and moved into the U.S. onshore-shale industry but was thwarted by government opposition in its attempt to buy Canada\u2019s             Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan.       BHP also greatly restructured its operations, most notably with the 2015 spinoff of a suite of assets including aluminum, coal and manganese as             South32 Ltd.Write to Robb M.

It was the most beautiful putting-me-at-ease ever,\u201d Mr. Turnbull joked to the crowd, impersonating Mr. Trump\u2019s voice to widespread laughter and applause. \u201cThe Donald and I, we are winning and winning in the polls. We are winning so much. We are winning like we have never won before.\u201dIn addition to journalists, the event was packed with most of Australia\u2019s senior cabinet ministers, as well as business leaders and lobbyists. In his routine, Mr. Turnbull cracked jokes about \u201cfake polls,\u201d riffing off Mr. Trump\u2019s frequent attacks on \u201cfake news.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re winning in the real polls. You know, the online polls. They are so easy to win. I have this Russian guy. Believe me it\u2019s true. It is true,\u201d Mr. Turnbull said.The prime minister\u2019s speech was supposed to be strictly off the record and unreported, but video and audio recording was leaked to an Australian television news channel.Relations between Messrs. Turnbull and Trump got off to a testy start in February after an unsanctioned leak of a phone conversation in which the U.S. leader berated his ally. Mr. Trump had objected to an Obama-era deal for the U.S. to accept around 1,250 mostly Iranian and Afghan refugees for resettlement from Australian immigration detention centers.Since that early clash, though, Mr. Turnbull has been among the president\u2019s most uncritical foreign supporters. Australia is one of America\u2019s closest allies and has fought alongside the U.S. military in every major conflict since World War I.\u201cWe get along great. We have a fantastic relationship, I love Australia, I always have,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters after the pair attended a dinner in May commemorating the 75th anniversary of the Battle of the Coral Sea, a World War II engagement in which allied forces checked the Japanese advance.Asked about the leak on Thursday, Mr. Turnbull said his speech was meant to be a \u201cgood-humored roast,\u201d taking aim at himself as much as Mr. Trump.\u201cIt\u2019s a breach of protocol, it\u2019s a breach of faith and all those things, but it\u2019s lighthearted, affectionate, good-natured. The butt of my jokes was myself. It\u2019s fun, you\u2019ve got to have a laugh. We\u2019ve got to lighten up,\u201d he said.\u2018The butt of my jokes was myself. It\u2019s fun, you\u2019ve got to have a laugh. \u2019The U.S. Embassy in Canberra said in a statement that it accepted Mr. Turnbull hadn\u2019t intended to offend Mr. Trump. \u201cWe understand that last night\u2019s event is equivalent to our own White House Correspondents\u2019 Dinner. We take this with the good humor that was intended,\u201d the statement said.Mr. Turnbull isn\u2019t the first Australian leader to be embarrassed by his dealings with a U.S. president. In 2008, former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd temporarily chilled relations when he recounted a phone conversation with President George W. Bush that revealed the American leader\u2019s ignorance of a coming Group of 20 meeting in Washington.Organizers of the ball said Thursday they were disappointed that some guests refused to comply with a nonpublication request, saying the event had \u201ca long tradition of being a lighthearted evening with a strong tone of self-deprecation.\u201d\u201cThe leaders\u2019 speeches this year reflected this sentiment brilliantly,\u201d said Andrew Meares, the president of Australia\u2019s Federal Parliamentary Press Gallery.Write to Rob Taylor at rob.taylor@wsj.comAppeared in the June 16, 2017, print edition as 'Australian Prime Minister Lampoons Trump.'", "news_time": "2017-06-16 01:05:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/australia-leader-mocks-donald-trump-we-are-winning-so-much-1497520273", "news_title": "Australian Leader Mocks Donald Trump: \u2018We Are Winning So Much\u2019 ", "keywords": "donald trump, malcolm turnbull, trump, turnbull,turnbull mocks trump,Donald Trump,Malcolm Turnbull,political,general news,international relations,politics,domestic politics"}]
