Yellen noted on Wednesday that while the U.S. economy was healthy enough for the Fed to tighten policy, the federal funds rate would not have to rise all that much further to reach a neutral level that neither encourages nor discourages economic activity.      I think most Asian markets reacted positively to Yellen's speech last night,  said Victor Felix, an equity analyst with AB Capital Securities.     Investors will now have confidence to take on more risks, seeing that the Fed won't be as quick to tighten monetary policy as previously expected, he added.     MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan  rose 1.2 percent to its highest since mid-2015.     In Southeast Asia, Philippine shares rose as much as 0.7 percent to hit a four-week high, heading for their third consecutive session of gains.     Industrials and financials led the gains, with conglomerate LT Group Inc providing the biggest boost to the index, rising as much as 8.6 percent to a nine-week high.      Singapore shares also gained as much as 0.7 percent, their biggest in a week, backed by financials and industrials.     DBS Group and United Overseas Bank rose 1.4 percent and 1.5 percent, respectively, while Jardine Matheson Holdings climbed 2.3 percent.     Thai shares rose as much as 0.6 percent to their highest in two weeks, led by gains in materials and energy stocks. Siam Cement advanced 2 percent, while oil and gas refiner PTT Pcl rose 1.3 percent.     Malaysian stocks were marginally higher ahead of Bank Negara Malaysia's policy meeting scheduled later in the day.     Malaysia's central bank will likely leave its benchmark rate unchanged, a Reuters poll showed, as inflation has been easing after hitting an eight-year high in March.     Indonesia was largely flat, while Vietnam rose marginally.

The U.S. economy is healthy enough for the Fed to raise rates and begin winding down its massive bond portfolio, though low inflation may leave the central bank with diminished leeway, Yellen said at her semiannual appearance before Congress on Wednesday. The dollar slipped as Yellen's comments sparked a significant decline in U.S. Treasury yields. The dollar index against a basket of major currencies was down 0.15 percent at 95.606 after retreating to as low as 95.511 the previous day, its weakest in 12 days.  The overall assessment is that Yellen sounded dovish, but perhaps this was a result of her attempt to assuage too many concerns at once,  said Bart Wakabayashi, branch manager for State Street Bank and Trust in Tokyo.  Our data suggests that U.S. inflation is actually picking up again. The Fed appears to still be in a position to continue hiking rates.  Market attention turned to U.S. inflation data and its potential impact on Fed policy. U.S. consumer price index (CPI) numbers are due on Friday and economists polled by Reuters expect the June core CPI figure to have risen 0.2 percent month-on-month, from a gain of 0.1 percent the previous month. The greenback extended overnight losses and was 0.2 percent lower at 112.950 yen, pulled back from a four-month high near 114.495 scaled earlier in the week on expectations of U.S.-Japan monetary policy divergence.  We could see the dollar begin to adjust lower against the yen. It has already made two failed attempts to break above 114.500, where a large line of offers stands,  said Junichi Ishikawa, senior forex strategist at IG Securities in Tokyo.  Furthermore, as the confident-sounding Bank of Canada (BOC) demonstrated with its rate hike, the dollar's strength is challenged, faced with a number of central banks poised for monetary policy shifts, which also include the Bank of England and the European Central Bank.  The BOC raised interest rates for the first time in roughly seven years on Wednesday, saying the economy no longer needed as much stimulus. The Canadian dollar, also boosted by a rise in crude oil prices, stood at C$1.2739 per dollar after rallying more than 1 percent to C$1.2681 overnight, its strongest since June 2016. Other commodity linked currencies like the Australian dollar were also on the front foot. The Aussie, which has gained about 1 percent so far this week, advanced to a 13-day high of $0.7697 . The euro edged up 0.2 percent to $1.1435, inching back towards a 14-month high of $1.1489 set on Wednesday. The common currency has gained steadily this month on speculation that the ECB would begin reversing its very easy monetary policy sooner rather than later.

A day after McGregor mercilessly mocked the American in Los Angeles to launch a four-day international promotional tour for their Aug. 26 fight, the flamboyant 28-year-old again went on the offensive, ridiculing Mayweather's attire and landing a low blow with a comment about his rumored reading difficulties.  “How do I look?” McGregor asked the crowd, before taking a swipe at Mayweather's bag.

I do numbers, I make money,” he said. “You owe money,” McGregor responded, referring to reports that Mayweather earlier this month asked the IRS for more time to pay his 2015 tax bill. Mayweather, who holds a perfect 49-0 record, was jeered relentlessly by the audience but did not appear rattled.     At one point he grabbed an Irish flag from the crowd and posed in front of McGregor. When the flag was passed to the Irishman he tossed it back in the boxer’s face.

That volume was down 20 percent from a record 9.59 million tonnes in May, but up 1.7 percent from 7.56 million tonnes in June last year, figures from the General Administration of Customs of China showed. Soy imports for the first-half of 2017 stood at 44.81 million tonnes, up 14.2 percent from the same period last year, the customs data showed on Thursday.  The market had expected June imports to be over 8.5 million tonnes at least,  said Liang Yong, analyst with Galaxy Futures.  But crushers have very high stocks so they had to delay discharging the soybeans. And many were probably waiting to discharge after July 1, due to the change of VAT policy,  China decided to reduce its value added tax on soybeans to 11 percent from 13 percent from July 1. The policy change and huge purchases of soybeans in recent months have caused congestion at major ports along China's coast, pushing up stockpiles to multi-year high. The situation is expected to continue with around 8.5 million to 9 million tonnes due to arrive this month. But analysts said large arrivals would come in eventually, pressuring crush margins in the world's top buyer of the oilseed, where margins have just climbed to positive territory this month, supported by strong U.S. soybean prices. Crushers in Shandong province, a major production hub in the country's east, now make 37 yuan on each tonne of soybeans processed as of Tuesday, up from a loss of over 300 yuan ($44.24) in June. JCI-SBMG-SHDNI  Stocks of soymeal and soyoil are still very high. And demand from feed producers is not that strong.

The injection was made through the People's Bank of China's (PBOC) medium-term lending facility (MLF) loans. A similar amount of such loans matures this month. The MLF loans injected on Thursday have a one-year tenure, with interest rates unchanged at 3.20 percent, the PBOC said in a statement on its website. MLF loans totalling 357.5 billion yuan mature in July. Two batches that together are worth 179.5 billion yuan are due to mature on Thursday. Another batch of one-year loans worth 39.5 billion yuan will mature on July 18 and 138.5 billion yuan of six-month MLF loans will be maturing on July 24. Traders and analysts said Thursday's cash injection through MLF loans was well within market expectations. Nie Wen, economist at Hwabao Trust in Shanghai, called Thursday's MLF operation  neutral .  Starting late June, liquidity in the financial system has improved while the pace of reducing leverage has become slower,  he said. Nie added that authorities have set financial stability as a key task for the second half after a deleveraging drive between April and early June impacted financial markets. However, a fixed-income trader at an asset-management firm in Shanghai said Thursday's injection of one-year MLF loans may have the effect of extending maturities, as some of the loans due in July had tenors of a few months. While banks are unlikely to be affected, entities more sensitive to short-term funding costs may have a more bearish outlook as a result, the trader said. In a report in early July, the PBOC said it would steadily push forward financial regulatory reform and improve the stability of financial institutions, as well as appropriately deal with some high-risk institutions this year. In Thursday's statement, the PBOC said it was skipping reverse repos in open market operations. Until Tuesday, when it had open market operations, the PBOC had abstained from them for 12 straight sessions, citing either  relatively high  or  appropriate  liquidity levels in the banking system.

The Nikkei rose 0.2 percent to 20,132.56 in midmorning trade. The benchmark index held to a tight range with limited upside as the dollar weakened against the yen after congressional testimony by Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen was seen as less hawkish than some traders had anticipated.

He said with global interest rates moving higher, foreign investors have remained cautious. On Wednesday, the Bank Of Canada raised interest rates for the first time in nearly seven years, reinforcing signs of a move by major global central banks - including those in Europe - to a less stimulatory stance. Some small cap shares outperformed, with Infoteria Corp surging 4.4 percent, Mixi Inc adding 0.5 percent while digital advertising firm SoldOut Inc, which debuted on Wednesday on the Tokyo Mother's market, jumped 17 percent.

Yellen said at her semiannual appearance before Congress that the U.S. economy is healthy enough for the Fed to raise rates and begin winding down its massive bond portfolio, though low inflation may leave the central bank with diminished leeway.

The mosquito-borne Zika virus was linked to more than 2,500 birth defects and caused an 18-month public health emergency in South America's largest country.  But campaigners on Thursday said a lack of government investment in sanitation services for the poor, insecure water access and other conditions which exacerbated the crisis are still present in Brazil, raising the potential of future outbreaks.  Other Zika-affected countries should recognize that human rights problems can contribute to the rapid escalation and impact of the Zika epidemic,  Amanda Klasing, a researcher for Human Rights Watch, said in a statement on Thursday.   Countries hoping to avoid the crisis Brazil continues to face should address human rights issues at the outset of their planning and response.  More than one-third of Brazil's 206 million people lack access to a continuous water supply, leaving residents with few options other than filling containers for household use. Left uncovered, these water containers can become breeding grounds for mosquitoes and the diseases they carry. In Brazil's poor northeast - where Zika hit hardest - less than 25 percent of the population was connected to waste water systems in 2015, Human Rights Watch said, echoing statements from U.N. officials about who was most impacted by the virus.   Zika happens in a historical context ... it mainly affects the periphery, mainly affects brown, black and young women,  said Jamie Nadal, a representative of the U.N. Population Fund during a conference earlier this year.  These historically disadvantaged groups are more likely to live in poor regions or informal settlements which do not have good healthcare and sanitation infrastructure compared to other parts of Brazil, according to campaigners.  Poor wastewater management leads to pools of stagnant, dirty water sitting in communities which are ideal breeding grounds for mosquitoes.  Across the country, more than 35 million Brazilians lack adequate facilities for the safe disposal of human waste.  Brazilian authorities say they are working to improve sanitation, especially for the country's urban poor who live in slums or favelas but a recession and political turmoil has hampered the government's investment ability.

The omission of online ads could be a potential hurdle for those investigating alleged Russian meddling in last year's U.S. presidential election, according to the campaign finance lawyers, who are not involved in the probes. Since 1974, the United States has barred foreign nationals from giving money to campaigns and it later barred them from donating to political parties. The laws also prohibit foreign nationals from coordinating with a campaign and from buying an ad that explicitly calls for the election or defeat of a candidate. At issue are laws concerning a category of ads known as  electioneering communications  that address where a candidate stands on an issue, that spread news stories about a candidate or that attack a candidate without directly calling for his or her defeat. Foreign nationals cannot spend money on electioneering communications but the term under U.S. law applies only to communications made by broadcast, cable or satellite - with no mention of the internet. A related law does bar foreign nationals from expressly advocating the election or defeat of a candidate in any advertising medium. But as long as online ads do not call on people to vote for a specific candidate,  they are not prohibited as a campaign finance matter,  said Jan Baran, a Washington lawyer who frequently represents Republican candidates. U.S. Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller was appointed in May to investigate alleged Russian interference as well as potential collusion between Moscow and associates of President Donald Trump. The Russian government says it did not meddle and Trump has denied collusion.  Facebook (FB.O), which has become a leading platform for online political ads, has said that it has not found any evidence that Russian agents were buying ads.  Facebook said in April, however, that it had become a battleground for governments seeking to manipulate public opinion in other countries and outlined new measures to combat what it called  information operations.   Trump's election campaign spent some $70 million on highly targeted Facebook advertising last year, Brad Parscale, the digital director of the campaign, told Reuters this year. The absence of rules governing online advertising ties the hands of the U.S. Federal Election Commission, said Ann Ravel, a former Democratic appointee to the commission.  The law seems to totally exempt it and therefore it is not possible either to reasonably determine who is behind those ads, do an investigation to find out or penalize for that activity,  Ravel said. Other laws could come into play in an investigation. The U.S. Foreign Agents Registration Act restricts publicity paid for by a foreign government such as Russia.

The S&P;/ASX 200 index clawed back Wednesday's losses, rising 1 percent to breach the psychologically important level of 5700 by 33.8 points. The benchmark closed at a three week low in the previous session, falling nearly 1 percent to 5,673.8. The Dow rose to a record high after Yellen's less hawkish than expected congressional testimony was seen as a green light for Wall Street to step up riskier trades. Investors also welcomed a dovish Fed amid concerns over a dip in U.S. inflation. In recent months U.S. inflation has moved further below the Fed's 2 percent target, even as the labour market has strengthened.  The Fed said it would alter its plan if weak inflation persisted so her comments were taken as being dovish in nature rather than hawkish,  said James McGlew, executive director of corporate stock broking for Argonaut in Perth.  There has been very much a hawkish theme throughout the course of this year and the much anticipated change in direction of interest rates upwards...is perhaps giving the Federal Reserve reason to contemplate, to hold rates where they are for a little bit longer.  Aussie financials shot up 0.6 percent though their U.S. counterparts, which tend to benefit from higher rates, were last among sectors, closing up 0.1 percent. Commonwealth Bank of Australia and Westpac Banking Corp, the largest among the  Big 4  domestic banks by market capitalisation, were among the top performers on the benchmark, 0.8 percent and 1.5 percent higher, respectively. Also among the top gainers was biotherapeutics firm CSL Ltd , a sector heavyweight, which pushed the healthcare index nearly 2 percent higher, its best intra-day performance since mid-June.

These historically disadvantaged groups are more likely to live in poor regions or informal settlements which do not have good healthcare and sanitation infrastructure compared to other parts of Brazil, according to campaigners.  Poor wastewater management leads to pools of stagnant, dirty water sitting in communities which are ideal breeding grounds for mosquitoes.  Across the country, more than 35 million Brazilians lack adequate facilities for the safe disposal of human waste.  Brazilian authorities say they are working to improve sanitation, especially for the country's urban poor who live in slums or favelas but a recession and political turmoil has hampered the government's investment ability.

Murray's hopes of becoming the first Briton to retain a grand slam title since Fred Perry in 1936 were shredded as he hobbled helplessly to a 3-6 6-4 6-7(4) 6-1 6-1 quarter-final defeat. The encounter ended in almost brutal fashion, as Murray struggled to move freely around the court in the final two sets and the big-serving Querrey ruthlessly put him to the sword, wrapping up victory with his 27th booming ace.  Despite the best efforts of the Centre Court crowd to cajole a miracle recovery from the limping Briton, Murray's troublesome hip proved beyond help and he was swiftly dispatched, with the final two sets taking just under 47 minutes.  Querrey can now lay claim to the title of Wimbledon's chief giant-killer, after slaying then champion Novak Djokovic last year. He becomes the first American man to reach a grand slam semi-final since Andy Roddick at Wimbledon in 2009.       I'm still in shock myself,  he said after setting up a semi-final encounter with Marin Cilic.   I didn't start my best but kept with it and kept swinging and I hit my groove in the fourth and fifth sets. Related CoverageTennis: Hips don't lie for beaten Murray at Wimbledon It feels great and it's a dream come true ... to get to a semi-final and have it happen at Wimbledon makes it a bit more special.  Having toured the game's most awkward and unconventional opponents in the opening four rounds, Murray finally got to face a more routine tennis archetype.  There are few surprises with Querrey's game. He stands at 6 foot 6 inches (1.98 meters) and uses his giant frame to launch bullets from the sky and backs up his huge serve with an occasional haymaker forehand.  Tennis - Wimbledon - London, Britain - July 12, 2017   Sam Querrey of the U.S. celebrates winning the quarter final match against Great Britain’s Andy MurrayAndrew CouldridgeHis gameplan seemed to involve turning Centre Court into a firing range which brought him little success in the opening set, but as Murray's movement became increasingly pained, the match turned emphatically in the American's favor.  Querrey would have been hard pushed to imagine such a glorious ending as Murray punished him almost at will in the opening set, when it was Murray's serve that did the greater damage and the 29-year-old seemed wracked with nerves.  Murray claimed that in 28 minutes and there was barely a hint of his vulnerability when he broke for a 4-3 lead in the second.  There were stunned murmurs of discontent from the home crowd, however, as Querrey broke twice to level the match, wrapping up the second set with a beautiful backhand winner.  Slideshow (12 Images)That still seemed only a momentary blip for the champion, who broke immediately at the start of the third set to move back into a short-lived ascendancy.  Querrey struck back in the 10th game forcing the set into a tiebreak and while Murray held his nerve to move back into the lead, from that point the writing was on the wall.  The home fans willed their man to scramble freely around the court, but his grimaces told their own story as he looked up to his box and seemed to mouth  it's gone, it's gone  in the fourth set. Querrey won nine games in a row to take the fourth and open up a 3-0 lead in the fifth, before breaking again to move one game from victory.  Two Querrey aces helped bring up three match points and one more finished the job off, leaving Murray to salute the home fans with an almost apologetic wave goodbye.  The whole tournament I've been a little bit sore,  Murray told reporters.   But I tried my best right to the end, gave everything I had. I'm proud about that.

Trudeau, who made headlines by naming a gender-balanced cabinet after his Liberals won a surprise majority government in 2015, will announce Payette's appointment on Thursday, the Globe and Mail newspaper and Canadian Broadcasting Corp reported. The prime minister's office did not respond immediately to a request for comment.

She was the first Canadian to board the International Space Station, in 1999, and flew on space shuttles Endeavour and Discovery.

Seeking to force Republican House leaders to allow a vote, Democrats on the House Foreign Affairs Committee introduced legislation unchanged from what passed the Senate by 98-2 on June 15 but has been stalled ever since. While the new bill is identical to what the Senate passed, it will be labeled as House legislation to avoid a procedural issue that prompted House Republican leaders to send the measure back to the Senate. However, there was no sign of support from Trump's fellow Republicans, who control majorities in both the House and the Senate and control what legislation comes up for a vote. AshLee Strong, a spokeswoman for Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan, dismissed the Democrats' action as  grandstanding.  The measure was introduced by House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi and Representatives Steny Hoyer, the No. 2 House Democrat, and Eliot Engel, the ranking Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Democrats have accused House Republicans of stalling the sanctions package because of Trump administration concern about provisions setting up a process for Congress to approve any  effort by the president to ease sanctions on Russia. Trump's attempts to mend relations with Russia have been hindered by allegations that Moscow interfered in the 2016 U.S. election and colluded with Trump's campaign. Russia denies meddling and Trump says there was no collusion.     The issue has become even more heated since emails released Tuesday showed that Donald Trump Jr, the president's eldest son, eagerly agreed last year to meet a woman he was told was a Russian government lawyer who might have damaging information about Hillary Clinton, the Democratic rival in the 2016 presidential election. Lawmakers and aides said news of that meeting, and the failure to disclose it, added new urgency to the push to pass the Russia package.  Dilly-Dallying  House Republican leaders said they had not taken up the original Senate bill because it violated a constitutional requirement that all legislation affecting government revenues originate in the House, known as a  blue slip  issue. Democrats and some Republicans who backed the bill scoffed, saying the problem could have been quickly remedied.  Dilly-dallying around about the blue slip issue was just a ridiculous waste of time. We could have fixed it in five minutes,  Senator Bob Corker, the Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told reporters. The Senate changed the bill to address that issue, but also tweaked it in a way that Democrats said weakened a provision requiring Congress to approve any effort by the president to ease sanctions on Russia. The new bill introduced on Wednesday would eliminate that change to allow House Democrats, as well as Republicans, to force a vote on a resolution of disapproval of any effort to ease Russia sanctions.  I don't believe that having the president's party in a position to protect him from any oversight is good policy for our country,  Hoyer told reporters. Ryan told a news conference he wants to move a strong bill regarding sanctions on Russia as quickly as possible but that the legislation still faced procedural and policy hurdles. The U.S. energy industry has been lobbying against the bill and some Republican House members, particularly from oil-producing states, have said they might want changes. The Russia sanctions legislation was written as an amendment to a bill imposing new sanctions on Iran over issues including its ballistic missile program. Besides establishing the review process, it puts into law sanctions previously imposed on Moscow via presidential executive order and introduces new sanctions.

A political storm has raged for two years in Malaysia over the scandal at 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), which is the focus of money laundering investigations in at least six countries, including Switzerland and the United States. Singapore public prosecutor Nathaniel Khng described the city-state's investigation as  the most complex, sophisticated and largest money laundering case  ever carried out by its  white-collar police. The former banker, Yeo Jiawei, 34, pleaded guilty to money laundering and cheating on Wednesday. Yeo is already serving a 30-month term on charges of perverting the course of justice by urging witnesses to lie to police and destroy evidence during the investigation into illicitly transferred funds linked to 1MDB.  The two schemes to secretly profit were dishonestly concealed from BSI Singapore ... and resulted in the accused earning in excess of US$3.5 million in illicit profits,  the public prosecutor said. Prosecutors previously said Yeo played a central role in the illicit movement of the 1MDB-linked funds both while he was working at the now defunct BSI Bank Singapore, and afterwards. Prosecutor Khng said, however, that the central figure and one of the  key persons of interest  was Low Taek Jho, a Malaysian businessman who has dropped out of public view. Low was an adviser to the state fund, whose advisory board had been chaired by Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak. Najib has denied any wrongdoing in 1MDB's problems and said Malaysia would cooperate with the international investigations.  A U.S. Department of Justice investigation in June highlighted Low's role in the scandal. The Singapore prosecutor said the case against Yeo related to two transactions that appeared to have been aimed to cover up the fact that $1 billion belonging to 1MDB had been transferred into a bank account that Low  beneficially owned . Low's whereabouts are not known, but a U.S.-based public relations firm issued a statement on his behalf, in response to  Reuters' request to one of his companies seeking comment.  Any attempts to link Mr. Low to the recent guilty pleas by parties allegedly making secret profits are based on unfounded assumptions,  said Boston-based Rasky Partners Inc. It added that Malaysian authorities had said there was  no evidence of any misappropriation of 1MDB funds , the allegations had not been proven in any jurisdiction elsewhere, and  this development in Singapore does not change that .  This is an example of overreach with a politically motivated and selectively chosen narrative alleging 1MDB as a  victim ,  it said, adding that  the allegations are flawed, biased and create an inaccurate picture.  The prosecutor had called for a stiff sentence for Yeo as a deterrent, partly in order to protect Singapore’s standing as an international financial center. In May, Singapore's central bank said it had ended its review of banks with 1MDB-linked transactions. As part of the two-year review, Singapore shut down the local units of BSI Bank and Falcon Bank due to failures of money laundering controls and improper conduct by senior management, froze millions of dollars in bank accounts and charged several private bankers. A spokeswoman for EFG International, which now owns BSI Bank, declined to comment.  Stefano Coduri, group chief executive of BSI Bank, stepped down after the closure of its Singapore operations last year and the bank said it took steps to strengthen management, such as introducing a new chief risk officer and appointing a new group legal counsel..

Brent crude futures were at $47.64 per barrel at 0133 GMT, down 10 cents, or 0.2 percent, from their last close. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $45.37 per barrel, down 12 cents, or 0.3 percent. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) said late on Wednesday that the world would need 32.20 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude from its members next year, down 60,000 bpd from this year, as consumers have increasing choice of supplies from outside OPEC. Meanwhile, OPEC said its output rose by 393,000 bpd in June to 32.611 million bpd. The gain was led by Nigeria and Libya. This came despite a pledge by OPEC to curb output by about 1.2 million bpd between January this year and March 2018, while Russia and other non-OPEC producers say they will hold back half as much. Despite the ongoing supply overhang, there are signs of a gradual reduction of the glut. In the United States, crude oil inventories last week dropped the most in 10 months. Crude inventories fell 7.6 million barrels in the week to July 7, to 495.35 million barrels. The decline was the biggest since the week ended Sept. 4. While U.S. crude inventories remain far above their five-year average, stocks have fallen 7 percent since record levels from late March.  U.S. inventory numbers confirmed that a drawdown (of excess inventories) was in train,  ANZ bank said.

Monterrey-based Jaguar Exploracion y Produccion de Hidrocarburos took a stake in over half the areas awarded, which the oil industry regulator said would eventually yield around $2 billion in investments over the 30-year lifespan of the contracts. A tie-up of Canada's Sun God Energia and Jaguar won six out of 10 areas available in the first of two tenders on Wednesday, the sixth and seventh auctions since a 2013-14 energy reform. There were no bidders for three of the areas. Bidding alone, Jaguar also scooped up another five areas in the second tender of 14 blocks, all of which were auctioned. Sun God Resources is based in Calgary, Alberta, while Jaguar is a Monterrey-based firm whose chief executive is Dionisio Garza, a well-known Mexican businessman. A consortium made up of Iberoamericana de Hidrocarburos Servicios and PJP4 de Mexico won one block in the initial auction and two in the second for a total of three. The second auction also saw a fresh push into Mexico by Asian investors, with a consortium of China's Shandong Kerui Oilfield Service Group with Mexico's Sicoval MX and Nuevas Soluciones Energeticas A&P; securing three areas. Slim's Carso Oil and Gas claimed two of the areas in the second tender, which saw a number of fields won by cash offers after more than one company made the maximum possible bid. Miguel Messmacher (R), a deputy finance minister, speaks to the media , during a news conference after an auction of offshore oil and gas blocks, in Mexico City, Mexico July 12, 2017.Henry RomeroNewpek, a unit of Mexican conglomerate Alfa, teamed up with U.S. firm Verdad Exploration Mexico to win two areas. The auctions are part of a constitutional reform to open up production and exploration to private investors with the aim of reversing a steady decline in oil output since 2004 and boosting anemic economic growth. The reform is starting to bear fruit. Juan Carlos Zepeda, head of the oil regulator known as the CNH, told a news conference that including the $2 billion he expected the new contracts to generate eventually, the reform had now secured projected investments of around $60 billion. Slideshow (6 Images)The 21 areas should yield an extra 79,000 barrels per day (bpd) in crude production by 2025 as well as 378 million cubic feet per day of additional natural gas output, Zepeda said. That production should start coming online in 2019, he added. Deputy energy minister Aldo Flores forecast the new blocks would generate about 20,500 jobs in the next seven years. Earlier, Britain's Premier Oil said it had found potentially more than 1 billion barrels of oil off the coast of Mexico in the first shallow-water offshore well drilled by the private sector in the country since the reform. The areas on offer on Wednesday were discovered by state oil company Pemex, but have been stymied by underinvestment as the former monopoly focuses on mostly shallow and less-costly water oil and gas fields. They range from areas rich in natural gas in the Burgos basin in northern Mexico to fields that hold promise further south in the Gulf states of Veracruz and Tabasco. Winners are determined based on a weighted formula that takes into account an additional royalty offered to the government as well as an extra investment commitment in the exploration phase of each 30-year contract.

A political storm has raged in Malaysia for the past two years over the scandal at 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), which is the focus of money laundering investigations in at least six countries, including Switzerland and the United States. Singapore public prosecutor Nathaniel Khng described the Singapore investigation as  the most complex, sophisticated and largest money laundering case  ever carried out by the city-state's white collar police. The former banker, Yeo Jiawei, 34, pleaded guilty to money laundering and cheating on Wednesday. Yeo is already serving a 30-month term on charges of perverting the course of justice by urging witnesses to lie to police and destroy evidence during the investigation into illicitly transferred funds linked to 1MDB.  The two schemes to secretly profit were dishonestly concealed from BSI Singapore ... and resulted in the accused earning in excess of US$3.5 million in illicit profits,  the public prosecutor said. Prosecutors previously said that Yeo played a central role in the illicit movement of the 1MDB-linked funds both while he was working at the now defunct BSI Bank Singapore, and afterwards. Prosecutor Khng said, however, that the central figure and one of the  key persons of interest  in investigations was Low Taek Jho, a Malaysian businessman who has dropped out of public view. Low was an adviser to the state fund, whose advisory board had been chaired by Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak. Najib has denied any wrongdoing in 1MDB's problems and said Malaysia would cooperate with the international investigations. A U.S. Department of Justice investigation in June highlighted Low's role in the scandal. The Singaporean prosecutor said the case against Yeo related to two transactions the objective of which appeared to have been to cover up the fact that $1 billion belonging to 1MDB had been transferred into a bank account that Low  beneficially owned . Low's whereabouts are not known. Reuters sent an email to his Hong Kong-based company, Jynwel Capital, requesting comment from him. The company had not responded by Wednesday evening. The prosecutor had called for a stiff sentence to be handed down to Yeo as a deterrent, partly in order to protect Singapore’s standing as an international financial centre. Singapore's central bank announced in May that it has ended its review of banks with 1MDB-linked transactions. As part of its two-year review, Singapore shut down the local units of BSI Bank and Falcon Bank due to failures of money laundering controls and improper conduct by senior management, froze millions of dollars in bank accounts and charged several private bankers. A spokeswoman for EFG International, which now owns BSI bank, declined to comment. Stefano Coduri, group chief executive of BSI bank stepped down after the closure of its Singapore operations last year and the bank said it had undertaken steps to strengthen management, including introducing a new chief risk officer and appointing a new group legal counsel. Two other former BSI staffers have been convicted and sentenced on charges stemming from the money-laundering investigation linked to 1MDB.

As part of its two-year review, Singapore shut down the local units of BSI Bank and Falcon Bank due to failures of money laundering controls and improper conduct by senior management, froze millions of dollars in bank accounts and charged several private bankers. A spokesman for BSI was not immediately available for comment on Yeo's sentencing. Stefano Coduri, group chief executive of BSI bank stepped down after the closure of its Singapore operations last year and the bank said it had undertaken steps to strengthen management, including introducing a new chief risk officer and appointing a new group legal counsel. Two other former BSI staffers have been convicted and sentenced on charges stemming from the money-laundering investigation linked to 1MDB. Founded by Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak, who previously chaired its advisory board, 1MDB is the subject of money laundering investigations in at least six countries, including Switzerland, Singapore and the United States. Najib has denied any wrongdoing and said Malaysia will cooperate with the international investigations.

Ltd.'s (BBB/Negative) proposed asset disposal to Sunac China Holdings Limited (Sunac; BB-/RWN) is credit positive to Wanda, as it will immediately alleviate its debt load and improve leverage and recurring interest coverage. The Negative Outlook on Wanda's rating, which reflects its rising leverage, may be revised to Stable once the transaction is completed and if there is evidence that Wanda will not aggressively leverage up again. Wanda on 10 July 2017 said it plans to dispose of its 91% equity interest in 13 cultural and tourism project companies in mainland China for CNY29.6 billion and its 100% interest in 76 city hotels for CNY33.6 billion to Sunac. Wanda will also obtain a three-year bank loan of CNY29.6 billion to advance to Sunac upon the transaction closure. Fitch expects the two companies to enter into a definitive agreement by end-July 2017. The planned transaction will immediately cut Wanda's net debt of CNY124 billion at end-2016 by about one fourth. Fitch revised its Outlook on Wanda to Negative from Stable on 2 September 2016 to reflect the agency's previous expectation that Wanda's fast-paced land acquisitions may cause its leverage, as measured by net debt/adjusted inventory, to increase above 40% for a sustained period. There is a high likelihood that the leverage ratio, which stood at 26.9% at end-2016, will now remain below Fitch's 40% threshold for negative rating action. The transaction is also likely to improve Wanda's recurring EBITDA interest coverage of 1.2x at end-2016. The proposed disposal demonstrates that Wanda is finally able to meaningfully execute its long-signalled intention to become more asset light. Its cultural projects are 1 million-5 million square metre projects with theme parks, malls, hotels and residential projects that require substantial investment outlay. Its hotels have not generated the same levels of return on investment as its malls. This is consistent with most other hotel assets in China, which typically are developed as part of larger mixed-use projects to achieve local government approval.

The 46-year-old Michigan native drew attention on Twitter and his Facebook page to a  Kid Rock '18 for U.S. Senate  website. It featured a photo of the goateed singer-songwriter wearing a leather jacket, dark glasses and white fedora, seated in a plush, star-spangled chair beside a stuffed deer above the tagline:  Are you scared?  The site also displays images of a T-shirt, baseball cap and bumper sticker emblazoned with the campaign logo,  Kid Rock for US Senate  and a box of alternating slogans, including,  In Rock We Trust,   Party to the People  and  You Never Met a Politician Quite Like Me.   I have a ton of emails and texts asking me if this website is real ... The answer is an absolute YES,  he said on his verified Twitter account.  Stay tuned, I will have a major announcement in the near future.  Reached by email, the musician's spokesman, Kirt Webster, referred only to Rock's Facebook page, which bore the same message. His music label, Warner Bros Records, also posted a website offering sales of Kid Rock for U.S. Senate merchandise. Born Robert James Ritchie in the Detroit suburb of Romeo, Michigan, he rose to fame in 1998 as his debut album  Devil Without a Cause  sold some 14 million copies. He gained additional celebrity through his courtship of actress Pamela Anderson and their brief marriage in the 2000s. FILE PHOTO: Kid Rock inducts rock band Cheap Trick at the 31st annual Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York, U.S. on April 8, 2016.Eduardo Munoz/File PhotoWhile no mention was made in Wednesday's online postings about Rock's political affiliation or in which state he would run, he presumably would seek to challenge Michigan's Democratic incumbent senator, Debbie Stabenow, who is up for re-election in 2018. The Capitol Hill-based newspaper Roll Call reported that Rock's name surfaced as a possible candidate earlier this month during a state Republican Party convention in Michigan, which Trump carried in the 2016 presidential race, though no official decisions were announced. Stabenow seemed to shrug off the prospect of a political challenge from Rock, saying in a Twitter post:  I know we both share a love of music. I concede he's better at playing guitar and I'll keep doing what I do best: fighting for Michigan.  According to Roll Call, Rock endorsed Republican Mitt Romney for president in 2012 and initially supported Ben Carson for the Republican nomination in 2016 but switched to Trump when the former reality-TV star became the party's nominee. Afterward, Rock released a line of pro-Trump merchandise, including a T-shirt that read “God Guns & Trump.”   In April, Kid Rock joined fellow rocker and conservative activist Ted Nugent and former Alaska Governor and onetime Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin for a White House visit and dinner with Trump. Kid Rock would not be the first showbiz figure to make a leap into politics. Besides Trump, he would follow the likes of singer Sonny Bono, who served as a U.S. congressman from California during the 1990s; pro-wrestler and actor Jesse  The Body  Ventura, elected Minnesota governor in 1998; and comedian Al Franken, now serving his second U.S. Senate term from Minnesota.

The Bank of Korea's monetary policy committee held its base rate KROCRT=ECI steady, a media official said without elaborating. Governor Lee Ju-yeol is due to hold a news conference from 11:20 a.m. (0220 GMT) All 20 economists surveyed in a Reuters poll had forecast the central bank would stand pat, noting that weak private consumption and tepid job growth are taking some of the shine off steady gains in exports. A majority of analysts see the central bank on hold for the rest of this year, and expect any move to normalize rates to happen next year.  The BOK will release quarterly revisions to its economic forecasts later in the day.   It would be difficult to raise rates in the second half but raising it in the first half of 2018 would be unavoidable,  said Oh Chang-sob, fixed-income strategist, Korea Investment and Securities, noting that higher U.S. interest rates raises the risk capital outflows from South Korea. Markets shrugged off the policy decision, with the won KRW= and stocks .KS11 up slightly and futures on three-year treasury bonds KTBc1 rising 0.02 points to trade at 109.17. After five years of accommodative policy, most analysts expect the BOK to take a hawkish turn next year in a more gradual approach to exiting low rates than some of its counterparts in Europe and Canada.   Indeed, while exports grew at a double-digit rate for the sixth month in a row in June, lukewarm jobs growth and subdued  private consumption argue against a rush to tighten rates. South Korea's consumer price inflation has cooled from the peak of 2.2 percent in March to 1.9 percent in June, slightly below the BOK's target of 2 percent. It's too early for the BOK to join global counterparts in talking up policy tightening, said Kim Yu-mi, an economist at Kiwoom Securities.   The BOK needs to confirm soaring exports leads to stronger domestic demand before it can rise interest rates,  Kim said before the rate decision.  The Federal Reserve has already raised rates twice this year and is expected to tighten again before year-end, while the European Central Bank is preparing markets for tapering its massive stimulus possibly as early as 2018.

Liu, a prominent participant in the Tiananmen pro-democracy protests of 1989, was jailed for 11 years in 2009 for  inciting subversion of state power  after helping to write a petition known as  Charter 08  calling for sweeping political reforms. He was recently moved from jail to a hospital to be treated for late-stage liver cancer. Liu's kidney and liver functions are failing and he suffers from blood clots, among other ailments, the hospital in the city of Shenyang said on its website. However, Liu's family has declined the use of intubation machinery to help him breathe with the aid of a plastic tube in his windpipe, the hospital said.  The patient is in a critically ill condition, the hospital is doing all it can to save him, and his family members understand the situation and have given their signatures,  it added, without elaborating. The announcement suggested a significant deterioration in Liu's health since early on Wednesday, when the hospital said he was being treated for worsening liver function, septic shock and organ dysfunction. Rights groups and Western governments have urged China to allow Liu and his wife, Liu Xia, to leave the country to be treated abroad, as Liu has said he wants. But the government has warned against interference and has said Liu is being treated by renowned Chinese cancer experts. Liu's international counsel Jared Genser told Reuters that getting him out of China for treatment was a realistic possibility if approval was granted soon.  But time is of the essence,  he said.  Every moment that passes makes that possibility more difficult.  White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders repeated a call for Liu to be free to travel abroad for treatment.  We remain concerned that Mr. Liu and his family are unable to communicate with the outside world and that he is not free to seek the medical treatment of his choosing,  she told a regular news briefing. A White House official said U.S. President Donald Trump raised Liu's case in a July 2 telephone call with Chinese President Xi Jinping, while the U.S. national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, raised it with his Chinese counterpart at the G20 meeting last week. Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo is seen in this undated photo released by his families. Handout viaFile PhotoJohn Kamm, of the San Francisco-based Dui Hua Foundation, which promotes prisoners' rights in China, said that based on what he had heard from official and unofficial sources,  I do not think the chance that (Liu) will be allowed to leave China for medical treatment is big . China's state-backed Global Times tabloid said the  confrontational tone  of those in the West voicing their opinions on Liu failed to focus on his illness.   China has already taken the feelings of relevant Western forces into consideration, and has no obligation to meet their unreasonable demands,  it said. The government allowed two foreign doctors, from the United States and Germany, to visit Liu on Saturday and they later said they considered it was safe for him to be moved overseas. After the doctors' Sunday statement, China released short videos of their visit, apparently taken without their knowledge, in which the German doctor appeared to praise the care Liu had received. Slideshow (3 Images)'Keep Calling' Hu Jia, a dissident and friend of Liu's, said he was deeply saddened to hear the news of his worsening condition but vowed to do all he could to push for Liu's freedom.  So long as Liu is still breathing and conscious, we should keep calling for him to be released and go abroad with Liu Xia, even if it is the last thing he does,  Hu said. Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen said on Twitter that the self-ruled island, which China claims as its own, called on Beijing to free Liu and Taiwan was willing to provide medical assistance. Liu's friends voiced suspicion about the hospital's earlier statement, which suggested a worsening of his health soon after two foreign doctors said he was well enough to travel abroad.  We do not know how reliable these accounts are, or if they mean Liu Xiaobo cannot travel,  one family friend told Reuters, declining to be identified because of the sensitivity of the situation. No one answered the telephone at the hospital's publicity department on Wednesday. In Hong Kong, about 50 protesters sat outside the Beijing representative office surrounded by placards demanding Liu's release. Some protesters had been there for a third day.  I feel scared. If we lose Liu Xiaobo, nobody could replace him,  said 17-year-old student Anson Hui.  If there's no Liu Xiaobo we can't unite the whole world to speak out ... The world will lose a spiritual leader.

The U.S. corn and soybean crops are in the worst condition since 2012, but the U.S. Department of Agriculture should still push new-crop production higher in its supply and demand report due at noon EDT on Wednesday.  Low crop ratings, regionally unfavorable recent weather, and the uncertainty over weather forecasts have some analysts convinced that USDA may adjust the 2017/18 corn or soybean yield accordingly in its July report. Each year starting with its May report, USDA's World Agricultural Outlook Board publishes trend-line yields in its monthly supply and demand reports for U.S. corn and soybeans, which for 2017 are 170.7 and 48 bushels per acre, respectively. This number is typically left untouched until the August update, when the yield is replaced with a modeled estimate from USDA’s statistics agency based on weather and other key inputs. USDA has adjusted yields in July a handful of times in the past though, so it is not unprecedented, but the crop conditions and overall recent weather may not be severe enough this time around to warrant an adjustment for corn or soybeans on Wednesday. Both planted and harvested acres for the country’s largest two crops will be higher on Wednesday than what was published in last month’s update, however. USDA always freshens up the July U.S. supply and demand tables with the new acreage numbers from its June 30 report, which this year will give production a boost. USDA’s June acreage report revealed that soybean and particularly corn plantings were heavier than originally thought. Assuming no changes to yield on Wednesday and taking the acreage increases, 2017/18 corn production will rise 188 million bushels over the June figure, while the soybean harvest will rise a more modest 6.3 million bushels. Past Yield Changes In the past 20 years, USDA has adjusted U.S. corn yield between June and July five times, and only three of them reflected a reduction – which would be the most likely scenario this year in the event of a yield modification. The reasons for the July decreases in corn yield were based on weather, conditions, and acreage updates. In 2005, yield was reduced 3 percent because of low crop conditions. Some 65 percent of the 2017 crop was in good or excellent condition as of Sunday, and in the same week in 2005 the figure was 58 percent. In 2008, yield was reduced fractionally due to a lower share of harvested area in the higher-yielding Corn Belt states due to heavy flooding, which was reflected in the June acreage report. Since nothing like this occurred this year, a yield adjustment based on shifting acres is also unlikely.  The most prolific July corn yield cut came in 2012 as USDA slashed off 20 bpa – amounting to 12 percent. The rapid decline in condition ratings – which were 40 percent good-to-excellent during the first full weekend in July – and the preceding extreme heat and persistent dryness led to the move.  None of the three scenarios described above appear to apply to U.S. corn in 2017, although if recent weather has been stressful enough in some of the primary growing regions, a yield cut could be warranted on Wednesday. But based on USDA’s past reasoning, it is unlikely.  USDA adjusts soybean yields in July less frequently, as much of the yield potential for the oilseed depends on August weather, particularly rainfall. Three changes have taken place over the last 20 years, all of them reductions. However, two of those reductions amounted to 1 percent or less. Excessive moisture in 2008 delayed soybean planting and emergence, and the hairline move in 2004 was the result of acreage shifts from the June report. Neither of these scenarios apply in 2017. USDA chopped soybean yields over 3 bpa – or 8 percent – from June to July in 2012, and this was for the same reason as the corn reduction. The amount of soybeans in good or excellent condition dropped 2 percentage points to 62 percent this week, but it was 40 percent during the same week in 2012. In the end, corn yield fell 26 percent from USDA’s trend-line in 2012, but it dropped less than half a percent in 2005 and 2008. Soybean yield fell 10 percent below trend in 2012 and 6 percent below in 2008, but they rose 6 percent in 2004. So even if USDA makes a reduction for either crop on Wednesday, it does not necessarily signal disaster.

OPEC agreements have been specified in terms of output rather than exports since the first allocations were agreed in March 1982 (“Annual Statistical Bulletin”, OPEC, 2017). Quotas, as the production allocations are informally known, apply to crude oil but not to condensates or other natural gas liquids. The system originally made sense but now appears increasingly outdated because of the rising production of natural gas liquids and the growing oil consumption within OPEC countries themselves. Between 1980 and 2016, OPEC’s crude production increased by 31 percent from 25.4 million barrels per day to 33.3 million bpd. But OPEC’s output of natural gas liquids sextupled from 1.0 million bpd to 5.8 million bpd over the same period. And OPEC’s internal oil consumption more than tripled from 2.6 million bpd in 1980 to 9.0 million bpd in 2016. In fact, OPEC’s own members have reported some of the fastest growth in oil consumption over the last four decades owing to population expansion and increasing prosperity. OPEC’s share of world oil demand has climbed from just 1.8 percent in 1973 and 4.1 percent in 1980 to peak at 9.9 percent in 2015 before edging down to 9.5 percent in 2016. OPEC’s internal demand has risen from 18 percent of its crude oil production in 1982 to as much as 28 percent in 2016. At the same time, some OPEC members have invested heavily in refineries and petrochemical plants to capture more value-added from their exports. OPEC’s refining capacity has grown from 5.3 million bpd in 1980 to 11.8 million bpd in 2016, according to the organization's data. The result of these changes is that crude production is less and less relevant to the volume and composition of the crude and refined products that OPEC exports to the rest of the world. Exports, net of any imports, rather than crude production, are what matters for the world supply-demand balance and global oil inventories. Confusion There are a range of other problems when it comes to analyzing OPEC production data. OPEC’s internal consumption has a strong seasonal element. Saudi Arabia and Iraq burn large volumes of crude and fuel oil in the summer to meet electricity and air-conditioning demand. So the same level of wellhead production can be associated with very different levels of exports and volumes of oil supplied to the market depending on the time of year. Conversely, the same level of exports can be associated with very different levels of output, depending on refinery intake and the amount of crude and fuel oil burned in domestic power plants. Saudi Arabia has been building gas-fired power plants to reduce combustion of crude and fuel oil for electricity generation.  While the policy is sensible, it has led to a significant shift in the relationship between production and exports and become an additional source of uncertainty. Adding to the confusion, wellhead production is known only to the countries concerned, cannot be independently verified and is reported with a long delay. A host of commercial tanker-tracking services have been launched in response, estimating export volumes in real time based on information broadcast by shipboard automatic identification systems (AIS). Like other commercial ships, oil tankers must be fitted with AIS equipment that continuously broadcasts critical safety data, including the vessel’s position, speed, heading, destination, cargo, dimensions and draught. Cross-checked with data from other sources, including port authorities and bills of lading, the AIS data can be modeled to estimate the volume of crude and other products being exported. Thomson Reuters has its own ship-tracking service but oil flows are also estimated by standalone cargo-tracking companies including Kpler. As with any model, the estimates are sensitive to the assumptions made to convert the AIS data into export volumes. But AIS data is available in real time, so many analysts rely on export estimates rather than wait for government production figures to track the volume of oil OPEC is supplying. The result has been confusion as analysts and traders struggle to reconcile government data on production and exports with commercial estimates of exports based on ship tracking. Ultimately, analysts and traders care about the volume and composition of crude and refined products being supplied to the market by OPEC members, rather than the amount produced at the wellhead. But OPEC’s current agreement focuses on wellhead output, which is neither verifiable nor particularly relevant, and leaves the market trying to figure out how it will translate into oil supply and inventories. In the future, OPEC members might want to consider an agreement that focuses on exports, and excludes internal consumption, as simpler and more transparent.

The contrasts between the two was immediately apparent as McGregor, wearing a navy pinstriped suit and tie, danced around the stage smiling while Mayweather, wearing a track suit with American flag details, looked on stonefaced. As is expected in the bout, McGregor was the aggressor, wasting no time bringing up reports that Mayweather earlier this month asked the IRS for more time to pay his 2015 tax bill.

Raw sugar prices in New York SBc1 were hovering around 13 cents per pound, down around 40 percent since the fourth quarter of 2016 to a level analysts and millers say is close to production costs in Brazil's center-south. At the same time, an ongoing slump in oil prices CLc1 LCOc1 has led state-controlled oil firm Petrobras (PETR4.SA) to repeatedly cut gasoline prices domestically.  That has in turn pressured ethanol producers to follow suit since the two fuels were sold side by side at the pump. The price pressure on sugar and ethanol could cut short a nascent financial recovery for many Brazilian mills during a global sugar supply deficit in 2015 and 2016. It could also slow down talks between millers and potential investors and lead to more closures of indebted firms.  We can't deny that the current situation strongly impacts our liquidity,  said Tony Rivera, a director at Renuka do Brasil SA, the local unit of Indian sugar maker Shree Renuka Sugars (SRES.NS). Renuka has four mills in Brazil and is one of dozens of companies that have filed for bankruptcy protection. The company has plans to sell two of its mills to pay debt and raise working capital to continue operations in the country, even at a smaller scale.  But Rivera says falling sugar and ethanol prices also impact that plan.  The current outlook is a problem, because on one side it scares those who are not fully convinced to invest in the sector. And on the other side, it brings down the price investors are willing to pay for the plants,  he said. Havoc A combination of weak sugar and ethanol prices in Brazil from 2010 to 2014 wreaked havoc on the sugar industry, triggering the closure of dozens of mills and leading many others to seek bankruptcy protection, a process that is ongoing. At the time, the government kept gasoline prices  artificially low to fight inflation, consequently cutting margins on ethanol sales, while a multi-year global sugar surplus depressed sugar values. Cane industry group Unica said 80 plants have been idled in Brazil since 2010. The closings reduced spare cane crushing capacity, limiting growth in the industry. According to Unica, sugar output was 35.6 million tonnes last season, up only slightly from 33.5 million tonnes in 2010/11.  Some of the hardest-hit firms have been snapped up by players with stronger capital structures. Last November, Glencore Plc (GLEN.L) bought the Guararapes mill to add a second plant to its operations in the main cane belt of Sao Paulo state, in a judicial auction.  Raízen, a joint venture of Cosan SA Industria e Comercio (CSAN3.SA) and Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSa.L), acquired two mills last month from Tonon Bioenergia in a similar auction. Renuka will try to sell its Brejo Alegre mill in a judicial auction as well on Sept. 4. Rivera said there were companies looking at data provided before the auction, but he declined to name them. Dario Gaeta, chief executive officer at Tietê Agroindustrial, the firm managing the two mills bought in 2015 by Cargill's Black River Asset Management LLC from distressed group Ruette, believed dozens of mills were up for sale, but that willing buyers were scarce.  Some mills are so heavily indebted that they would need to sell themselves for 1 dollar and hope banks will accept a large haircut to allow new owners to invest and revamp operations.  Debt, Funding     Brazilian investment bank Itaú BBA said 15 percent of Brazil's mills were struggling with excessive debt loads. Sao Paulo-based Archer Consulting estimates the sector's total debt at 86 billion reais ($26.4 billion).  For those firms still struggling with non-operational difficulties, the new market situation certainly does not help,  Pedro Barreto, Itaú BBA's Agribusiness director, said in an interview. Fitch Ratings questioned the chances for troubled mills to recover, such as the ones under bankruptcy protection.  Positive outcomes depend largely on a successful operating environment, higher sugar and ethanol prices, and unhindered access to funding given the capital-intensive nature of the business,  the debt rating agency said in a research note. International bond markets are unlikely to offer much in the way of alternatives for Brazilian mills, and funding from the domestic capital market is not a realistic option for most companies in the sector, Fitch added. Itaú BBA's Barreto sees merger and acquisition talks cooling under the current situation, since the distance between what sellers want for assets and what buyers are willing to pay tends to increase as sugar prices fall.

The new exchange, which will offer trading in base metals such as copper and aluminum, is aiming to go live by the end of the first quarter of 2018 with contracts that mimic the LME's.  NFEx is talking to the LME, Intercontinental Exchange, SGX and CME Group, sources said.  We are in commercial negotiations with several leading commodity clearing Houses, some of these discussions are further progressed than others,  NFEx's chief operating officer Mark Bradley said. ICE, SGX and CME declined to comment. The LME said:  We welcome new initiatives that encourage more volume to the market. As with any potential business opportunity we would always be willing to discuss possible areas where we believe mutual growth could be achieved.  Before launch, Britain's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) needs to authorize NFEx as a multilateral trading facility (MTF). FCA approval is conditional on NFEx having a capital base of 730,000 euros, which sources say it has, and enough cash to operate for at least two years. It is expected to apply for FCA approval by early August.  Clearing arrangements can be agreed at a later date, but will be key to gaining traction.  Netting margin requirements -- typically a deposit required for a futures or forward contract for individual metals -- for commodity futures is possible to some extent on all exchanges. But metals brokers prefer LME Clear, which could help clear the way for NFEx to use LME settlement prices. It would also mean those seeking to trade on the LME and NFEx would not have to pay into two default funds, which protect clearing members in the event one firm cannot honor its trades. Different Contracts  The market wants (NFEx's) clearing to be done by the LME. The margining and administration would make it easier for brokers that want to use both,  a head of a metals brokerage said.  NFEx wants to capture the business that went OTC (over-the-counter), that the LME lost.  An economic slowdown in China, the world's largest consumer of industrial metals, and a massive 31 percent fee hike at the start of January 2015 saw volumes at the LME drop 4.3 percent in 2015 and 7.7 percent in 2016. The resulting drop in revenues could be partly offset by clearing for NFEx, an idea the LME is open to so long as the new exchange does not try to invade its territory, meaning the contracts would have to be different in some way, sources said. One difference is that NFEx is planning cash-settled contracts, while the LME's are physically deliverable.  Another distinguishing feature could be NFEx using  request-for-quote  as an execution venue, a process which offers all participants the opportunity to quote for a specific trading strategy or contract, a source familiar with the matter said.  If the LME wants to launch its own OTC platform, it won't want to clear someone else's OTC trades,  a trader at a copper  producer said.  But they could go with NFEx, save their money and absorb it at a later date if it works.  One idea in the LME's discussion paper launched in April was an OTC or  permissioned dealer-to-client platform separate  to LMESelect, the exchange's electronic trading system.  ICE is the other name that keeps coming up,  a source at a futures exchange said.  ICE could clear for NFEx and in the agreement include an option to take a stake.  ICE lost a bidding war for LME in 2012. It was beaten to the finish by Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing, which paid $2.2 billion for the world's largest and oldest metals market.

The omission of online ads could be a potential hurdle for those investigating alleged Russian meddling in last year's U.S. presidential election, according to the campaign finance lawyers, who are not involved in the probes. Since 1974, the United States has barred foreign nationals from giving money to campaigns and it later barred them from donating to political parties. The laws also prohibit foreign nationals from coordinating with a campaign and from buying an ad that explicitly calls for the election or defeat of a candidate. At issue are laws concerning a category of ads known as  electioneering communications  that address where a candidate stands on an issue, that spread news stories about a candidate or that attack a candidate without directly calling for his or her defeat. Foreign nationals cannot spend money on electioneering communications but the term under U.S. law applies only to communications made by broadcast, cable or satellite - with no mention of the internet. A related law does bar foreign nationals from expressly advocating the election or defeat of a candidate in any advertising medium. But as long as online ads do not call on people to vote for a specific candidate,  they are not prohibited as a campaign finance matter,  said Jan Baran, a Washington lawyer who frequently represents Republican candidates. U.S. Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller was appointed in May to investigate alleged Russian interference as well as potential collusion between Moscow and associates of President Donald Trump. The Russian government says it did not meddle and Trump has denied collusion.  Facebook (FB.O), which has become a leading platform for online political ads, has said that it has not found any evidence that Russian agents were buying ads.  Facebook said in April, however, that it had become a battleground for governments seeking to manipulate public opinion in other countries and outlined new measures to combat what it called  information operations.   Trump's election campaign spent some $70 million on highly targeted Facebook advertising last year, Brad Parscale, the digital director of the campaign, told Reuters this year. The absence of rules governing online advertising ties the hands of the U.S. Federal Election Commission, said Ann Ravel, a former Democratic appointee to the commission.  The law seems to totally exempt it and therefore it is not possible either to reasonably determine who is behind those ads, do an investigation to find out or penalize for that activity,  Ravel said. Other laws could come into play in an investigation. The U.S. Foreign Agents Registration Act restricts publicity paid for by a foreign government such as Russia.

The Kremlin said on Tuesday it regretted the U.S. move against Kaspersky Lab, adding:  We certainly believe that this is a politicized decision .  This is an absolutely commercial company which provides commercial services which are not only competitive but are super-competitive globally,  Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told a conference call with reporters. Kaspersky's anti-virus software is popular in the United States and around the world, and the firm has been a leading player in the cyber security market for decades.  Russia as a state will continue to spare no effort to protect the interests of our companies abroad,  Peskov said. U.S. lawmakers have raised concerns that Moscow might use the firm's products to attack American computer networks, a particularly sensitive issue given allegations by U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia hacked and leaked emails of Democratic Party political groups to interfere in the 2016 presidential election campaign. Russia denies the allegations.

A power-sharing coalition between pro-British Protestant unionists and Irish Catholic nationalists collapsed in January and the protracted political impasse raised fears that inter-community relations might deteriorate.  Traditional July and August marches are seen as a barometer of those relations and Wednesday's were among the most peaceful since a 1998 peace deal ended three decades of sectarian fighting in which 3,600 people died.  Police Service of Northern Ireland Assistant Chief Constable Alan Todd called it  the most peaceful Twelfth of July for some years and a model for years to come.  Tens of thousands of mainly Protestant unionists, some wearing orange sashes and bowler hats began marching across the province early on Wednesday to the accompaniment of pipe bands.  The marches mark the 1690 victory by Protestant King William of Orange over Catholic King James at the Battle of the Boyne, which secured Protestant ascendancy in Britain and Ireland.  The sort of angry protests by nationalists, who want Northern Ireland merged with the Republic of Ireland, that frequently greet the marches, were nowhere to be seen, though the worst trouble tends to occur late in the evening.  A morning unionist march past an Irish nationalist estate in North Belfast that has often been the scene of violence passed off without incident. Marchers agreed to cancel the evening leg, which has frequently caused street clashes. Drummers participate during the Twelfth of July events held by members of Loyalist Orders in Belfast, Northern Ireland July 12, 2017.Clodagh KilcoyneThe grand secretary of the Orange Order, which organizes the marches, said there appeared to be less tension this year.  We took a deliberate decision last year not to issue statements about parades so that would not increase tensions. I believe that paid off,  Mervyn Gibson told the BBC.  Slideshow (15 Images)Police said they had launched an investigation after some unionists overnight burned a replica coffin bearing the image of Martin McGuinness, former leader of the nationalist Sinn Fein party in Northern Ireland, who died in March.  The coffin was burned on a large bonfire in Belfast along with Irish flags and Sinn Fein election posters.  Sinn Fein national chairman Declan Kearney described the burning of the coffin as a  particularly sickening manifestation of hate  and called on unionist politicians to condemn it.  Some commentators linked the collapse of talks between Sinn Fein and the Democratic Unionist Party earlier this month to a reluctance to risk angering supporters ahead of July 12 by making major concessions. Talks between the parties on resurrecting the power-sharing government are to resume later in the summer.  The governments of Britain and Ireland have warned that failing to forge a new deal would have  profound and serious  implications and limit Northern Irish influence in Britain's negotiations to leave the European Union. However, no one is forecasting a relapse into serious sectarian violence.

The announcement came months after U.S. President Donald Trump said he would either renegotiate or terminate what he called a  horrible  trade deal. U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, acting on Trump's instructions, said the joint committee under the U.S.-Korea Trade Agreement (KORUS) would meet in Washington next month. No date has been set.  Since KORUS went into effect, our trade deficit in goods with Korea has doubled from $13.2 billion to $27.6 billion, while U.S. goods exports have actually gone down,  Lighthizer said in a statement.  This is quite different from what the previous Administration sold to the American people when it urged approval of this Agreement. We can and must do better,  he said. Trump, in an interview with Reuters in April, blamed the trade deal on his 2016 Democratic presidential election opponent, Hillary Clinton, who as secretary of state promoted the final version of the agreement before its approval by Congress in 2011.  It's a horrible deal, and we are going to renegotiate that deal or terminate it,  Trump said in the interview. A South Korean trade official told Reuters on Thursday that it will hold the proposed joint committee either in Seoul or Washington, but this does not necessarily mean that South Korea will renegotiate the deal.  We will meet and discuss mutual interests and concerns. Our stance is that we have not agreed on renegotiation of the deal,   Yeo Han-koo of South Korea's trade ministry said over the phone. He said South Korea believes the deal is mutually beneficial, and the two countries need to first establish whether the U.S. trade deficit with South Korea is caused by the trade deal or is a result of other fundamental economic issues.      On July 1, Trump met South Korean President Moon Jae-in and said the United States was renegotiating what he characterized as a  rough  trade deal with South Korea agreed to five years ago by his predecessor, Barack Obama.     KORUS was initially negotiated by the Republican administration of President George W. Bush in 2007, but that version was scrapped and renegotiated by President Barack Obama's Democratic administration three years later.

The 39-year-old Kerr notched her 19th career tour victory by winning April's LPGA Lotte Championship in Hawaii, and last week finished fifth at the Thornberry Creek Classic. She is also in line to make her ninth U.S. Solheim Cup team and sees no reason to lower expectations.  I honestly think it's desire,  Kerr told reporters on the eve of the U.S. Women's Open when asked about her longevity.  I love to practice, I love to compete and win and have a chance to be contending and it's a rush.  Golf was the first thing I ever fell in love with and it's a relationship that you can have for a lifetime.  Last year youth ruled women's golf, but 2007 champion Kerr and other more mature players are fighting back. In 2016, with Lydia Ko, 18, Brooke Henderson, 19, and Ariya Jutanugarn, 21, leading the way, the average age of LPGA Tour winners was a startling 22.3. This year through the first 16 events the average age was 26.3, not counting 24-year-old Danielle Kang's triumph at the KPMG Women's PGA major and last week's Thornberry Creek win by 35-year-old Katherine Kirk.  I feel like as long as I feel like working at it, feel like training and trying to keep my body fit ... you can play for as long as you want,  the 14th-ranked Kerr said.  I've won many times in my 30s, and when I was 39 now, and I want to try to break some of the stereotypes out here, win in my 40s and 50s. Why not?  Kerr said she has long idolised World Golf Hall of Famer Juli Inkster, who amassed 31 career wins, including seven majors. Inkster won her last event at age 45 and her last major at 42, and does not doubt what her fellow American can do.  Cristie's wired a little bit like me on the golf course. She's feisty. She shows her emotions,  U.S. Solheim Cup captain Inkster told reporters.  She has a real passion for the game of golf.  She doesn't mind putting the time in. She loves to play. And that's 90 percent of the battle when you get to a certain age. You have got to want to play and you have got to want to be good.  She still has that. She still thinks she can be number one in the world. I don't think there is any reason why she can't be.

Huge Greens Softened by thunderstorms this week, the 6,732-yard course could favor long hitters but the huge greens could put a premium on putting.  I like the high, long hitters, someone like Amy Yang, someone like maybe a little bit of Gerina Pillar,  said Juli Inkster, twice Women's Open winner and now a FOX Sports commentator.  You need to come in from the air on these greens. You need to be precise with your irons. You need to play smart.  Other leading contenders include Danielle Kang, whose triumph two weeks ago at the KPMG Women's PGA Championship marked her maiden tour win, and fellow American defending champion Brittany Lang. Lang, who has three other top-10 finishes in the Open, has struggled this season but seems to save her best for this event.  It has been a little bit of a disappointing year,  said Lang, who missed the cut at the Women's PGA and does not have a top 10 finish this year.

No other serving BoE policy maker apart from McCafferty has proposed changing this.  The BoE views interest rates as a more precise monetary tool than QE. Even a partial reversal of QE would involve a commitment to sell gilts back to the market over many months. McCafferty, who voted to raise interest rates in June, was looking to vote for a quarter-point rate rise again in August, the newspaper said. He cited strong jobs data and 42-year-low unemployment as factors supporting a rate increase. On Wednesday, the Bank of England's top official Ben Broadbent said in an interview he was not ready to raise interest rates just yet.

Maria Baptista and Elita Zacarias  are linked to the ex-Minister Haiman El Troudi and must appear July 27,  the state prosecutor's office said on Twitter, without providing further details. El Troudi later said that his relatives, whom local media have reported are his wife and mother-in-law, had nothing to do with the case.   To get to me, Mrs. Prosecutor, my immunity is no obstacle and my family shouldn't be the way forward,  he tweeted.  As this case is chiefly political, know that I will be the one to present myself to the prosecutor's office, with my conscience clear and my head high.  Reuters was unable to obtain comments from Baptista and Zacarias. Odebrecht, the largest engineering and construction company in Latin America, acknowledged in 2016 that it paid some $98 million dollars in bribes over several years to obtain contracts in Venezuela. Earlier this year, the prosecutors sought the arrest of Odebrecht Venezuela chief Euzenando Azevedo, but he has not yet been captured and is presumed to have already left the country. President Nicolas Maduro has publicly said that those responsible for the embezzlement must be punished.  But the investigation has moved particularly slowly through the justice system, in contrast to other countries in the region where similar bribery took place. Odebrecht has left at least 23 multi-million dollar projects unfinished or stalled in Venezuela, according to company and government documents, interviews with over two dozen workers, and site visits. Still, a political showdown between the government and the prosecutor might be hastening investigations.  Prosecutor Luisa Ortega is clashing with the leftist government, and her office appears to have sped up accusations of high-profile Socialist Party officials, security officials, and oil executives in the last month. But the pro-government Supreme Court later on Wednesday issued a decision curtailing the prosecutor's powers to indict people. Ortega has also said she expects to be fired after accusing Maduro's government of human rights violations and erosion of democracy. She has said she would resist such a move.

A year-long study by the women's rights organization the Fawcett Society and the Local Government Information Unit found     about 17 percent of council leaders in England and Wales are women, a figure that has hardly shifted for 10 years. Only one in three local councillors is female - with the slow pace of change meaning it will take county councils until 2065 to have equal numbers of men and women - and almost a third of female councillors experiencing sexist comments. Digging into the reasons for this, the report found only four percent of local councils have formal parental leave policies in place and 80 percent of seats go to incumbents at election time, making it hard for women to break in. Sam Smethers, chief executive of the Fawcett Society, said  significant barriers  remained in place for women - even though Britain will next year mark 100 years since women could first  be elected into parliament.  We are going backwards and that is fundamentally unacceptable in 21st century,  Smethers said in a statement. Chairwoman of North Tyneside Council, Cath Davis - a single mother who works full time - said she was initially encouraged by other women to join the council but on arrival found the demographics were  a lot of retired, white men . Although this has changed, there remain hurdles deterring women such as time, childcare and transport, she said, adding, that key roles were still predominantly filled by men.  Men's Club   I would like to see more women in strategic roles,  she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation, noting that positions regarding culture, children and other  nurture  roles were mostly occupied by women.  [There's] still a bias towards us doing the softer roles.  In Manchester City Council there are often young children in the chamber, said Susan Cooley, former Lord Mayor of the city and a councillor who is working to establish crèche facilities. When she took up her post more than 20 years ago, Cooley said the council was dominated by  old dinosaurs  who still regarded the chamber as a men's club. But the landscape in Manchester has changed with the council among the few in Britain where female members outnumber males. Dame Margaret Hodge, co-chair of a commission of experts put together by the Fawcett Society, said the culture still favored men as decision makers.  The way councils do business is still designed by, and for, men. This needs to change, and fast,  Hodge said in a statement.  Currently local government is not fit for purpose and does not work for women.  Claire Kober, the first female chair of London Councils which represents the capital's 32 borough councils and the City of London, said the report revealed  the uncomfortable truth about the representation of women in local government . The report made a number of recommendations to help drive change, including calling for targets for female representation and legalizing remote attendance.  Being a councillor is so rewarding and offers a great opportunity to learn new skills,  Gillian Keegan, co-chair of the commission of experts, said in a statement.  We need to get out there and sell the merits of the role to women across the country.

The protests came after President Joko Widodo signed a decree on Monday widely believed to be aimed at containing the rise of hardline Islamist groups that call for sharia law in the world's largest Muslim-majority country. Islamist groups were instrumental in the downfall earlier this year of Jakarta's former governor, a Christian who was accused and subsequently jailed for insulting Islam.   The events, including massive and sometimes violent rallies led by hardliners and vigilantes, raised concerns about the erosion of Indonesia's long-standing image as a tolerant and pluralistic state. It has the world's largest Muslim population.  This decree is proof that this regime is repressive, authoritarian, and even repeating what the New Order regime did,  Ismail Yusanto, spokesman for Hizb-ut Tahrir Indonesia, referring to the rule of former strongman president Suharto, said in a statement that was echoed by human rights groups. Suharto ruled Indonesia for 32 years during which he demanded loyalty to the secular state ideology Pancasila – or  five principles  – and discouraged the organization of religious groups. His downfall in 1998 ushered in democratic reforms, and alongside them a new-found freedom for hardline Islamist groups, many of which have been involved in harassing and violently attacking religious minorities, feminists and lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) groups. Conservative Islamic civil society groups and New York-based Human Rights Watch also criticized the government's move.  Indonesian Minister for Political, Legal, and Security Affairs Wiranto talks to reporters in Jakarta, Indonesia, July 12, 2017 in this photo taken by Antara Foto. Picture taken July 12, 2017. Antara Foto/Rosa Panggabean via REUTERSHizb-ut Tahrir is a peaceful organization that calls for sharia (Islamic law) to be implemented in Indonesia and the government has said it will be disbanded. Indonesia has the world's largest Muslim population and sizeable communities of Christians, Hindus, Buddhists and people who adhere to traditional beliefs. Religious freedom is enshrined in the constitution and the Pancasila. The new decree allows for the government to disband organizations deemed to run counter to the Pancasila without taking them to court.   It must be underscored that this decree is not intended to discredit Islamic organizations or the majority Muslim population of Indonesia,  chief security minister Wiranto told reporters on Wednesday.   It has been issued in the national interest.  He added that the decree had the backing of Indonesia's biggest moderate Islamic groups, which have millions of followers. The decree adds that civil organizations are  not allowed to carry out activities that are the responsibility of law enforcement officials , in a reference to Islamist vigilante and anti-vice groups accused of harassing minorities. The decree comes after public outrage over the jailing of ex-Jakarta governor Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, who many believe was unfairly targeted and represents the crumbling of Indonesia’s pluralistic tradition. President Widodo recently told Reuters that he believes the country's reputation for moderate Islam remains intact and that  pluralism has always been a part of the Indonesia's DNA .

Days later she was sold to a brothel in the western Indian city of Pune in Maharashtra state - about 2,000 km (1,240 miles) away from her homeland - where she says she was  beaten, abused and locked in a room  and forced to have sex with countless men. Payal was rescued  9 months and 11 days ago  and put up at a shelter in Pune. She didn't think anyone could help her go home. About the same time, about 1,500 km away in New Delhi, Mosharaf Hossain, head of the consular section of the Bangladesh High Commission, was clearing travel permits for a rising number of rescued trafficking victims stranded in India.  I found girls and also boys from Bangladesh who were suffering a lot, waiting for long (times) to return home, because of our slow investigation,  Hossain, who joined the High Commission in March 2015, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  I started working faster and soon more alerts on rescued girls started pouring in. I met girls in Kerala who had been staying at a government shelter for seven years waiting.  Over the past two years Hossain has been on a mission to speed up the repatriation of Bangladeshi girls trafficked to India for the sex industry. In the past year Hossain has visited shelters across the country, including a shelter run by the non-profit Rescue Foundation in Pune where he met Payal about two weeks ago. She shared her story and her address with him, which was verified. Her travel permit was issued last week and she will leave for Bangladesh within two months.  My mother cried when I told her I was coming home. I told her I was in a bad shape until a few months ago, but now I am fine,  Payal told the Thomson Reuters Foundation at the shelter.  I am happy I am going home from a shelter and not a brothel.  Speeding Up Hossain, a former Deputy Inspector General in Bangladesh,  has sent about 438 girls home, nearly half of them in the last six months and most from Maharashtra, India's second most populous state and a major destination for trafficked girls. Girls from Bangladesh who were sex trafficked to India at a shelter home for rescued girls in Pune in Maharashtra, India, show a cloth on which they have embroidered Bengali words - “Mother and father’s kindness” -  THOMSON REUTERS FOUNDATION/ROLI SRIVASTAVACampaigners said this is the highest number of girls to be returned in such a short time span to Bangladesh where traffickers target poor women and children and promise them good jobs in India but sell them into brothels or domestic servitude. Many are rescued but the wait to go home is long despite India and Bangladesh having an inter-country task force for about a decade to organize repatriations, said campaigners.  The process has only got smoother now as High Commission officials are taking interest,  said Jyoti Nale, program director for Save the Children India, which works with the Maharashtra government to repatriate girls. Shiny Padiyara, superintendent of the Rescue Foundation shelter in Pune, has seen girls get restless with the long wait.  Earlier, the girls stayed at the shelter for two to three years before the travel permit would come. They would get aggressive and in 2015, some girls broke a lot of things and a few ran away,  Padiyara said. In May this year, 22 girls left the shelter for home, and travel permits have now arrived of 18 of the 19 girls there now. The waiting period has shrunk to two weeks to a month from four to five months as Hossain follows up on each case with officials and police in Bangladesh and coordinates with charities on both sides of the border to verify addresses and arrange phone calls between the parents and the child.  I realized that the reaction time is important,  said Hossain.  It is our responsibility to look after our destitute girls and children and ensure they go back home, safe.  Payal said she looks forward to boarding the train with the 17 other girls to West Bengal's capital Kolkata where an Indian police van will take them to the border.  The girls will be handed over to a charity in the presence of Bangladesh migration officials and then to their parents.  I look forward to my favorite meal of fish that my mother cooks. Even if she serves me water, I'll be happy,  Payal said. Padiyara is delighted to get the girls home but does fear early repatriations could lead to acquittals of the accused in these cases.  I am not sure if they will have access to video conference facility to appear for their cases that are pending in Indian courts,  said Padiyara.   It takes two years for the trials to end and these girls don't have passports to return to India. And nobody wants to stay here.

Evacuation orders in the path of the Wall fire were reduced to warnings on Wednesday but according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection more than 600 homes remained threatened.  The blaze has displaced 4,000 people and charred some 5,800 acres of tall grass and chaparral in Butte County, north of Sacramento.

The clause calls for an investigation should any board director be accused of sexual harassment. If it is found that there was  reasonable probability  that an incident occurred, the director would be removed. Sexual harassment by startup investors is in the spotlight in Silicon Valley after revelations of sexual misconduct led to the resignation of top partners at venture firms 500 Startups and Binary Capital.  We wanted to create a culture of inclusion and respect supported by board members who shared those values,  said Bergman, whose company's technology helps companies meet compliance mandates, in an email.  That's why we created a mechanism that forces an investor to replace the assigned director on our board should sexual harassment occur.  Bergman witnessed a sexual harassment complaint first-hand. In her last days as a principal at the Seattle venture capital firm Ignition Partners in March 2016, Bergman received an email accusing a partner of publicly groping a 20-year-old staffer at a happy hour event. That partner, Frank Artale, resigned as managing director this week at Ignition's request after it  learned of a complaint of misconduct  on July 5, the firm said late Tuesday, citing that allegation and the 2016 incident.  While the investigation did not substantiate the allegations, it did indicate that he demonstrated poor judgment, which we addressed with him,  Ignition said in a statement. Integris raised money from Ignition and three other venture firms following the 2016 accusation. Bergman, a former Microsoft Corp product manager, declined to comment on whether the Artale case influenced her, but called her company's anti-harassment clause  good corporate governance  that she hoped would serve as a model for other organizations. Integris' policy is a rarity, but other startups are moving in that direction. Wizeline, a San Francisco firm whose roadmap software is used by other tech companies, in May adopted a policy that calls for an investigation anytime someone reports sexual harassment.  Employees found to have violated the policy will be fired regardless of their position, said Sung Hae Kim, vice president of people operations at Wizeline.  There's no special treatment.  Among venture capitalist firms, Foundry Group said it would enforce a  zero tolerance policy  on harassment at any company or venture firms in which it has invested. Allegations will result in immediate investigations, firm co-founder Brad Feld wrote in a June blog. It remains to be seen how these policies will be enforced, but they are a good start, said Lisa Wang, co-founder of SheWorx, a collective of female entrepreneurs. SheWorx is developing an online database for entrepreneurs to report unethical behavior by investors.  These are the types of tangible actions that are actually going to create change because there are real consequences for bad behavior,  Wang said.  But it's one thing to have policies. It's another thing to consistently follow through with them.

Although the mining season does not begin until autumn, when the ground freezes and work is safer, the 31-year-old and his colleagues are seeking to gain a head start by digging a shaft in Nalaikh, one of the nine districts of Mongolia's capital Ulaanbaatar, in late June.  But their mine could soon be shut by the government, which has launched an unprecedented crackdown on sites that don't meet safety standards.  That would mean even fewer opportunities for Mongolia's individual prospectors, who have already been hit hard by the privatization of mines previously open to all. Miners such as Uuganbaatar dig for coal under loose arrangements with local unions and private companies.   Things seem really tough for private miners now,  said Uuganbaatar, who, like many Mongolians, goes by one name.   All the licenses have been bought up by influential big shots. Whenever you start to dig somewhere, someone shows up and chases us away. It's impossible to find a place or mine to dig in.   A weak economy and particularly harsh winters drove herdsman from across Mongolia to Nalaikh's private mines in the late 1990s and early 2000s.  Uuganbaatar works on extracting coal from a primitive mine in Nalaikh, one of the nine districts of Mongolian capital Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia June 29, 2017.B. RentsendorjThe district, with a population of nearly 30,000, was home to Mongolia's first state mining company, which collapsed in the 1990s in the midst of a post-communist economic crisis. The firm's dilapidated buildings dot the landscape.  With the economy slowing again after a commodities boom earlier in the decade, authorities fear more people could be tempted down the mines.   More mines will probably be shut down,  said Byambadorj, a woman who ran two private mine shafts with her husband for 13 years until the government closed them in June.  Slideshow (2 Images) In Nalaikh, life revolves around mining, and mining is the main means to support our lives,  she says, insisting that her mines were operating according to the safety standards.  The government had tried to get companies to improve safety by issuing licenses. An official said nine companies had been granted licenses, but not all had met the standards.      People were working in shafts with no air supply,  said S. Battulga, an official whose department is responsible for reviewing mining licenses across the country.   Therefore it was requested that the private mining licenses in Nalaikh be canceled,  on health and safety grounds, he added. Nalaikh authorities would like people to switch from mining to work in brick factories but no one seems keen to switch despite the danger. In the past 25 years, the government has recorded 234 fatalities in Nalaikh's coal mines, although residents say the real number is hundreds higher.

Corrects name to Ritchie, not Richie, in paragraph 6.) By Ben Klayman DETROIT, July 12 (Reuters) - Recording star Kid Rock, an outspoken supporter of Republican President Donald Trump, hinted in website and social media messages on Wednesday that he intends to run for the U.S. Senate in 2018. The 46-year-old Michigan native drew attention on Twitter and his Facebook page to a  Kid Rock '18 for U.S. Senate  website, featuring a photo of the goateed singer-songwriter seated in a star-spangled chair in dark glasses and white fedora, above the tagline:  Are you scared?  The site also displays images of a T-shirt, baseball cap and bumper sticker emblazoned with the campaign logo,  Kid Rock for US Senate  and a box of alternating slogans, including,  In Rock We Trust,   Party to the People  and  You Never Met a Politician Quite Like Me.   I have a ton of emails and texts asking me if this website is real ... The answer is an absolute YES,  he said on his verified Twitter account.  Stay tuned, I will have a major announcement in the near future.  Reached by email, the musician's spokesman, Kirt Webster, referred only to Rock's Facebook page, which bore the same message. His music label, Warner Bros Records, also posted a website offering sales of Kid Rock for U.S. Senate merchandise. Born Robert James Ritchie in the Detroit suburb of Romeo, Michigan, he rose to fame in 1998 as his debut album  Devil Without a Cause  sold some 14 million copies, and he gained additional celebrity through his courtship of actress Pamela Anderson and their brief marriage in the 2000s. While no mention was made in Wednesday's online postings about Rock's political affiliation or even in what state he would run for office, he presumably would seek to challenge Michigan's Democratic incumbent senator, Debbie Stabenow, who is up for re-election in 2018. The Capitol Hill-based newspaper Roll Call reported earlier this month that Rock's name surfaced as a possible candidate at a Michigan Republican Party convention, though no official decisions were announced. According to Roll Call, Rock endorsed Republican Mitt Romney for president in 2012 and initially supported Ben Carson for the Republican nomination in 2016 but switched to Trump when the former reality-TV star became the party's nominee. Afterward, Rock released a line of pro-Trump merchandise, including a T-shirt that read “God Guns & Trump.” In April, Kid Rock joined fellow rocker and conservative activist Ted Nugent and former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin for a White House visit and dinner with Trump.

Whitehaven, which produces both thermal and metallurgical coal from three mines in New South Wales state, had set full-year production guidance of 21 million to 22 million tonnes for the year. Coal miners earlier this year enjoyed a temporary spike in the prices of metallurgical and energy coal, which peaked in early April at $314 a tonne and $89 a tonne respectively before subsiding to finish flat quarter on quarter.  Indonesian supply continues to be impacted by weather-related delays, which supports expectations that thermal coal prices will remain in a relatively narrow range around current levels in the near term,  the coal miner said in its release of full-year operating data to the Australian bourse. Spot metallurgical coal prices were stabilising and were expected to remain around current levels in the near term, it added. Shares of Whitehaven slumped to a more than nine-month low in May before paring some of the losses in June on gains in coking coal prices. The company said it expects to sell about 1 million tonnes of metallurgical coal in the September quarter. It did not give an outlook for thermal coal sales. Managed coal sales for the June quarter, excluding sales of purchased coal, were 5.4 million tonnes, up 5 percent from a year ago. The company said sales for the quarter were below expectations due to a train derailment, a slower than expected recovery from rail line maintenance and some port congestion.

Trump,Donald Trump Jr.,Hillary Clinton,James Gardner,Joshua Douglas,Natalia Veselnitskaya,Paul S. Ryan,Robert Mueller,Trump Jr.,US,USA,TRUMP,RUSSIA,COLLUSION,United States","sector":"Politics","content":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Donald Trump Jr.'s meeting with a woman he was told was a Russian government lawyer who had incriminating information about Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton that could help his father's presidential campaign could lead investigators to probe whether he violated U.S. election law, experts said.  Trump Jr. met the woman, lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, on June 9, 2016, after an email exchange with an intermediary.  The emails, tweeted by Trump Jr. on Tuesday, could provide material for Special Counsel Robert Mueller's probe into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 presidential election.  In one of the emails dated June 3, 2016, Trump Jr. wrote:  If it's what you say I love it.  He released the tweets after the New York Times said it planned to write about their contents and sought his comment. Trump Jr. said in his tweets that nothing came of the meeting. Veselnitskaya told NBC News early on Tuesday she was not affiliated with the Russian government and had passed no information.   In retrospect, I probably would have done things a little differently,  Trump Jr. said in an interview on Fox News.  For me, this was opposition research.  Collusion itself is not an actual crime under the U.S. criminal code, so prosecutors would look to see if Trump Jr.'s conduct ran afoul of a specific law, legal experts said. Moscow has denied interference in the U.S. election, and President Donald Trump has said his campaign did not collude with Russia. Alan Futerfas, Trump Jr.'s lawyer, did not respond to a request for comment. A spokesman for Mueller declined to comment.  Federal Election Campaign Act FILE PHOTO: Donald Trump Jr. (L) with Donald Trump during the 2016 Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Ohio U.S. July 20, 2016.Jim Young/File photoOne law that might come into play is the Federal Election Campaign Act, which makes it illegal for a foreign national to contribute to a U.S. political campaign. The campaign is also prohibited from soliciting such contributions. A contribution does not have to be monetary in nature, according to Paul S. Ryan, an attorney with watchdog group Common Cause. He said incriminating information about Clinton could be considered a contribution under the act. Ryan said Trump Jr.'s  enthusiastic response  to the offer for information and particularly his proposal in his email to have a follow-up call the next week constituted  solicitation.    That to me is an indication, a concession by Donald Trump Jr. that he wants and is requesting this information,  Ryan said.  Joshua Douglas, a professor at the University of Kentucky College of Law, said Trump Jr.'s emails made it  more plausible  that there could be a criminal case against him. James Gardner, an election law expert at the University of Buffalo Law School, said the election law was intended to target donations of cash or goods and services. He said he did not believe Trump Jr. would have violated the law if he solicited damaging information about Clinton.  A federal law known as the general conspiracy statute that makes it illegal to conspire to commit a crime against or defraud the United States could also come into play if, for example, Trump Jr. tried to help Russians hack into U.S. computer networks. There was no indication that Trump Jr. did such a thing. Andrew Wright, a professor at Savannah Law School who was  associate counsel in the White House Counsel’s Office under former Democratic President Barack Obama, said he thought Trump Jr.’s agreeing to meet with someone to discuss an illegal act would be enough to trigger a conspiracy charge.  “It’s a very powerful tool,” he said.

Rising global yields forced the Japanese central bank to rev up bond buying last Friday to cap 10-year Japanese government bond (JGB) yields around its zero percent target, putting it at odds with its counterparts eyeing an exit from ultra-loose policy. On top of an increase in regular bond buying, the BOJ offered to buy unlimited amounts of 10-year JGBs at 0.110 percent - employing its most powerful tool for only the third time since adopting yield curve control (YCC) in September. With JGB yields having stabilized, policymakers say the step reminded investors that the BOJ won't follow the U.S. Federal Reserve or European Central Bank in dialing back stimulus any time soon. But Friday's episode underscored the challenges the BOJ faces in battling market forces beyond its control. By offering to buy at the same rate at which it intervened in February, the BOJ has effectively set a  line in the sand  that it may have to defend each time overseas forces drive up Japanese yields, say people familiar with the bank's thinking. That runs counter to the hope that many BOJ officials had to leave some flexibility on when and at what level the central bank steps in to defend its yield target.  YCC is a difficult framework to manage. It's fine when yields are low and stable, but that's not always the case,  said one of the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity.  That view was echoed by two other people, with one saying:  It's hard to know what could have happened if the BOJ waited a little longer before stepping in.  Under YCC, the BOJ guides short-term rates at minus 0.1 percent and the 10-year JGB yield at around zero percent. It does not define what is considered  around  zero.  Stealth  Tapering While BOJ officials say they won't hesitate to step in for as much as needed to defend their yield target, doing so would also complicate the bank's attempt to gradually whittle down its massive bond-buying program. The key aim of adopting YCC was to shift the BOJ's policy target to interest rates from the pace of money printing, as its huge bond buying was drying up liquidity and nearing its limit. Having already gobbled up 40 percent of the entire bond market, the BOJ has been quietly slowing its purchases in what some analysts described as  stealth  tapering. Ramping up bond buying again would severely distort market functions and makes a future exit from ultra-loose policy even more difficult, said former BOJ board member Sayuri Shirai.  It's necessary to taper the BOJ's asset purchases to make its policy framework sustainable,  she said.  It's pretty clear the merits of the current stimulus program are diminishing and the costs rising.  The BOJ was forced to increase buying three- to five-year JGBs on Wednesday as five-year yields hovered near 1-1/2 year highs. Crunch Time Many BOJ officials say markets have over-reacted to ECB President Mario Draghi's signals of a gradual withdrawal of stimulus, and cling to hopes that the impact of global bond yield rises on Japan would be limited. They argue that JGB yield gains won't last unless driven by a pick-up in Japanese inflation, which remains elusive. But there's no guarantee global yield rises will be subdued, with the Bank of England and Bank of Canada joining others seeking to pull the plug on extraordinary monetary support deployed during the global financial crisis. For the BOJ, raising the 10-year JGB yield would be hard to justify with inflation far from its 2 percent target, but allowing yields to deviate too far from its zero-percent target could cast doubt on its resolve to defend the target, and accelerate JGB yield rises.  I can't see how the BOJ can beat market forces when the global tide of central banking is toward normalization,  said Mari Iwashita, chief market economist at SMBC Friend Securities. Even if the BOJ were to ramp up bond buying to fight the market's tide, it may face diminishing returns. The more frequently it steps in, the BOJ could lose the  surprise  effect on markets, said Yusuke Ikawa, Japan strategist at BNP Paribas Securities.  In the short term, the BOJ can make sure 10-year yields don't rise if they get creative with their market operations, but if they buy too many bonds this year they could be in a tight spot next year.  Frequent intervention may also draw international criticism as an attempt to intentionally weaken the yen, said Tsuyoshi Ueno, senior economist at NLI Research Institute.  JGB yields may face upward pressure from overseas in a scale unprecedented since the adoption of YCC,  he said.  Markets will begin testing the BOJ's resolve if European and U.S. yields rise more. It will be crunch time for the BOJ.

Javier Duarte, who governed the Gulf state of Veracruz for President Enrique Pena Nieto's Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) until last year, could be returned to Mexico on July 17, Guatemalan foreign ministry spokesman Tekandi Paniagua said.  Mexico has proposed July 17 at nine in the morning for the extradition,  Paniagua said. The Mexican government gave no immediate comment on the widely expected announcement by Guatemala.

Duarte, who denies any wrongdoing, was arrested in Guatemala in April after more than five months on the run. He disappeared last October after taking leave of office and authorities issued an arrest warrant.

HMRC, the government department responsible for tax collection, began setting up a new Customs Declaration Service (CDS) in 2013 to replace the existing system for collecting about 34 billion pounds ($44 billion) in annual duty on imports from countries outside the European Union. That was before Britain voted last year to leave the EU. The National Audit Office (NAO) warned significant work was needed to complete the development of the CDS by the planned date of Jan. 2019.    There is a risk that HMRC will not have the full functionality and scope of CDS in place by March 2019 when the UK plans to leave the EU,  the NAO said in the report released on Thursday.  In 2015 nearly 700 billion pounds of goods crossed the border. The continued smooth operation of these crossings is critical to the UK economy.  Britain is set to leave the EU's customs union when it exits the bloc. Its current customs system processed around 55 million pounds' worth of import and export customs declarations in 2015-16, and HMRC predicts that once Britain is out of the customs union that figure will rise to 255 million pounds.   The programme is ... currently operating with some uncertainty due to the unknown outcome of the UK/EU negotiations, and no changes have yet been made to the scope of the CDS programme following the UK's decision to leave the EU,  the NAO said. It said any changes required because of Brexit would increase the risk of additional cost or delay. However, HMRC said the CDS was on track for delivery on time.  We took the decision to bring in a new declaration system before the EU referendum, but the service remains fully capable of dealing with how the UK's exit from the EU will impact on customs declarations at the border,  a spokesman said. Opposition lawmakers and businesses voiced concern at the NAO's findings. Mike Cherry, National Chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said the government needed a  Plan B  in case the CDS was not ready.  It's extremely concerning that the UK’s new customs system may not be ready in time for Brexit, potentially resulting in massive delays to trade and leaving thousands of businesses in the lurch,  he said.

Whether stronger exports can offset a squeeze on consumer demand is the key question for Britain's economy as it grapples with the effect of last year's sharp fall in sterling following the vote to leave the European Union. The Bank of England predicts the overall effect will be modest, and could raise interest rates for the first time in a decade later this year if that continues to be the case. But the BCC - which carries out Britain's biggest quarterly survey of businesses - said economic activity was subdued in the three months to the end of June.  For many businesses growth is static at best, and at worst, beginning to slow,  BCC director-general Adam Marshall said.  The subdued growth picture underlines the importance of getting as much clarity on the Brexit transition as possible, as quickly as possible over the coming months,  he added. Overall, the BCC data fit the pattern of other business surveys in the past week, which have shown weakening investment plans and slowing business activity. British quarterly economic growth tumbled to 0.2 percent in the first three months of this year, and the NIESR economic think tank estimated last week that growth only edged up to 0.3 percent during the second quarter. Despite the gloomy outlook, some measures in the BCC's survey were robust. Manufacturers reported the fastest export growth in three years, while the services sector enjoyed the biggest increase in foreign sales in more than a year. The two sectors were more upbeat about the outlook for total sales over the next 12 months than at any time since last year's vote to leave the EU. However, the BCC said services businesses that relied on British consumers suffered from inflation, which is its highest in nearly four years. Overall, services businesses' domestic sales slipped, as did investment and hiring intentions.  While the manufacturing sector enjoyed a solid quarter, the improvements are from a low base, and the longer-term trends suggests that the sector's contribution to overall UK growth will not be enough to offset weaknesses elsewhere,  the BCC's head of economics, Suren Thiru, said.

What started as damage limitation, however, turned into a battling recovery and ended as a brutal slaying of the world number one.

The ruling marked a stunning fall for Lula, one of the country's most popular politicians, and a serious blow to his chances of a political comeback. The former union leader, who won global praise for policies to reduce stinging inequality in Brazil, faces four more corruption trials and will remain free on appeal. The verdict represented the highest-profile conviction yet in a sweeping corruption investigation that for over three years has rattled Brazil, revealing a sprawling system of graft at top levels of business and government. Judge Sergio Moro found Lula, 71, guilty of accepting 3.7 million reais ($1.2 million) worth of bribes from engineering firm OAS SA, the amount of money prosecutors said the company spent refurbishing a beach apartment for Lula in return for his help winning contracts with state oil company Petroleo Brasileiro (PETR4.SA).  Federal prosecutors have accused Lula, Brazil's first working-class president from 2003 to 2011, of masterminding a long-running corruption scheme that was uncovered in a probe into kickbacks around Petrobras.   Lula's legal team said in an emailed statement that he was innocent and they would appeal.   For over three years, Lula has been subject to a politically motivated investigation,  they wrote.  No credible evidence of guilt has been produced, and overwhelming proof of his innocence blatantly ignored.  Lula's lawyer Cristiano Martins has repeatedly accused judge Moro of being biased against his client, which Moro strongly denies.  Related CoverageBrazil's Lula to appeal conviction: lawyerMoro wrote in his ruling that he  took no personal satisfaction in this conviction, quite to the contrary.   It's lamentable that a president of the republic is criminally convicted,  Moro said.  No matter how important you are, no one is above the law.   The Brazilian real BRBY extended gains following the decision and reached its strongest in two months. The benchmark Bovespa stock index .BVSP rose to a session high. Investors fear that another Lula presidency would mean a return to more state-directed and less business friendly economic policies.  Power Vacuum on Left  Former Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva is seen during the inauguration of the new National Directory of the Workers' Party, in Brasilia, Brazil July 5, 2017.Ueslei MarcelinoLula would be barred from office if his guilty verdict is upheld by an appeals court, which is expected to take at least eight months to rule. If he cannot run, political analysts say Brazil's left would be thrown into disarray, forced to rebuild and somehow find a leader who can emerge from the immense shadow that Lula has cast on Brazilian politics for three decades.  Lula's absence opens a gaping hole in the political scene, it creates an enormous power vacuum on the left,  said Claudio Couto, a political scientist at the Getulio Vargas Foundation, a top university.  We have now entered a situation of extreme political tension, even beyond the chaos we have been living for the last year.  Couto said he expected Lula's guilty verdict to be upheld by the appeals court. That would leave the 2018 presidential race wide open and raise chances of a victory by a political outsider, given most known contenders are also ensnared in Brazil's corruption investigations. Slideshow (15 Images)Boom to Bust Lula's two-terms were marked by a commodity boom that momentarily made Brazil one of the world's fastest-growing economies. His ambitious foreign policies, aligning Brazil with other big developing nations, raised the country's profile on the global stage. With Lula's swagger setting the tone, Brazil sought to shrug off northern economic and political hegemony and engage in global problems, like Middle East peace and the standoff over Iran's nuclear program. Former U.S. President Barack Obama once labeled him the most popular politician on earth. But upon leaving office and managing to get his hand-selected successor Dilma Rousseff elected, Brazil's economy soured, with the nation just now beginning to emerge from its worst recession on record. Rousseff was impeached last year for breaking budgetary rules. She and her backers say her ouster was actually a 'coup' orchestrated by her vice president and now President Michel Temer, who himself faces corruption charges.  During his trial, Lula gave five hours of fiery and defiant defense, proclaiming his innocence and saying that it was politics and not the pilfering of public funds that put him on trial.     But what is happening is not getting me down, just motivating me to go out and talk more,  Lula said in his testimony.  I will keep fighting.

The widely expected rate increase makes Canada the first major central bank to follow the Federal Reserve in removing some of the monetary stimulus poured into the global economy after the 2007-2009 financial crisis. Economists said the central bank's statement suggested at least one more quarter-percentage point rate increase is in store for 2017, with more likely to follow gradually if growth continues to meet expectations. The central bank cited a need to look through soft inflation as it hiked rates for the first time since September 2010 but said it will wait for more economic data before committing to its next move.  There is an upward revision to our outlook of course because of the data ... but more importantly it's our confidence that has increased through those months compared to where we were at the beginning of the year,  Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz said at a news conference.  It's that confidence in the outlook that makes us more confident today, to make the change we've made.  The increase, which pushed the official interest rate up to a still-low 0.75 percent, boosted the Canadian dollar to a near 11-month high and sent yields on Canada's two-year bonds to their highest since September 2014. A Reuters poll of economists on Tuesday showed a sharp shift in sentiment in the week leading up to the rate decision, with many bringing their rate hike expectations forward based on hawkish comments from policymakers.  I thought the Bank of Canada did a masterful job today,  said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at Western Union Business Solutions in Washington.  They raised rates and they stopped short of promising another rate hike this year but they were broadly bullish on the economy which bodes well for another rate increase this year.  Years of ultra-low interest rates since the financial crisis spurred a borrowing binge and helped drive Canadian household debt to record levels in recent years, fueling a housing boom that has recently began to falter. The bank said in its accompanying monetary policy report that activity in the housing sector has abated, largely due to sharp declines in resales in Toronto and surrounding areas. The central bank has repeatedly warned about the vulnerabilities posed by the massive consumer debt but was forced to cut interest rates twice in 2015 as oil prices dropped, sideswiping Canada's energy-dependent economy. In a decision that emphasized the lag between a rate hike and future inflation, the bank signaled it did not want to commit to a predetermined path of more hikes. Acknowledging the contradiction in raising rates when inflation is low, the bank said it will analyze short-term price fluctuations  to determine the extent to which it remains appropriate to look through them,  and noted temporary factors like electricity rebates have kept a lid on prices.

The Appalachian state recently took $40 million from its reserve fund and found another roughly $60 million by squeezing cash out of state agency accounts to fill in a revenue shortfall for the last fiscal year, Nick Casey, the governor's chief of staff, told a news conference.  Drawing down these two sources of funds, however, did not create a sufficient cushion to enter the new fiscal year with a balanced budget, Casey said.   As we finish this year, we don't look too good,  he said. The new fiscal year began on July 1.  Lawmakers in West Virginia, which is rated AA-minus by S&P; Global Ratings and Fitch Ratings and has a slightly higher rating of Aa2 from Moody's Investors Service, passed a $4.26 billion state budget in mid-June without the governor's signature.   Justice, a Democrat and longtime agriculture businessman worth about $1.6 billion, refused to veto the bill in order to avoid a government shutdown. The governor had asked for more spending in 2018. Initial overestimates of revenue from personal income taxes, corporate net income taxes and consumer sales taxes were largely to blame for 2017's shortage, Casey said.   As a result of the $11 million gap, residents should expect cuts to public service departments, he said.  The West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources and volunteer fire departments will be the first to face reductions as a result of the gap, Casey said.  Fairs and festivals, and the annual stocking of creeks and rivers for fishing, would also be vulnerable to cutbacks, he said.  When you don't have $11 million, you have to find somewhere to get it,  Casey said. The one  bright spot  of the state's finances has been severance tax collections, paid largely by coal companies mining in the state, which came in about $58 million above estimates in the last four months, Casey said.

The groups, including the Natural Resources Defense Council and Earthjustice, argued the agency's June 6 announcement that it would wait to identify areas of the country where smog pollution is especially heavy until it gathered more information and reviewed existing pollution standards was illegal. At issue in the lawsuit is a provision in the Clean Air Act that requires the EPA to decide what levels of smog pollution are acceptable, then identify parts of the country where pollution exceeds those levels and enforce their cleanup. The agency released standards and designations in 2008 and 2015, and was due to update them this year.  Simply put, delay of designations delays the stronger pollution controls Congress mandated to protect people in communities with unhealthy air,  said the lawsuit, filed in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Liz Bowman, a spokeswoman for the EPA said the agency had asked lawyers representing the groups in a phone call on Tuesday to delay filing their suit for two weeks. She said the EPA was still working on the designations and its lawyers believed the suit would be unnecessary once the groups saw the results of the agency's work. Bowman said the groups were reading too much into the delay.  The agency was not going to meet the original deadline for all 50 states,  she said.  This administrator doesn't like being outside the bounds of statutory deadlines so he said extend it. We're continuing our work.  The topic has been a recent source of dispute. Environmental groups and representatives of industries that contribute to smog, like power plants, sparred in court over whether the previous designations were too lax or too strict. Mustafa Ali, a former assistant associate administrator for environmental justice at the EPA, criticized the delay and said the suit, in which he was not involved, was warranted. If the EPA needed more time to deal with certain states over their designations, the agency could do so without the overall delay, he said.  You can always work with states that are not moving quickly, you can build some accommodation into the process,  he said.  How long do these communities need to wait?

The lawsuit said some U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents have referred to the tough immigration policies of President Donald Trump when turning asylum seekers back. But it also said human rights groups have documented  hundreds  of cases dating back to at least the summer of 2016, before Trump's election win in November. Filed by a non-profit legal services group called  Al Otro Lado  along with six unidentified people in U.S. District Court in central California, the class action lawsuit said border agents have used  misrepresentations, threats and intimidation,  to tell asylum seekers they cannot enter the country at various border crossings in California, Arizona and Texas. The accounts of the plaintiffs detailed in the lawsuit could not be independently verified. U.S. Customs and Border Protection did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the lawsuit. Under U.S. immigration law, if someone arriving at a U.S. port of entry expresses fear of returning to their country, border agents should refer them to an interview with a designated asylum officer. The lawsuit detailed the case of a woman from Mexico whose brother-in-law was a high-ranking police official killed and dismembered by a drug cartel in Mexico, which then threatened her family. When she arrived with her children at the San Ysidro, California, port of entry and said she was afraid to go back, a border officer coerced her into signing a form in English that she did not understand withdrawing her application for admission to the United States, the lawsuit said. Apprehensions of immigrants on the southwest border have dropped since the beginning of the Trump administration in January, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection statistics. Apprehensions are down more than 67 percent to more than 21,000 in June of 2017 from more than 66,000 in October.

There is nothing average about Federer, though, as he proved again on Wednesday by turning his 100th Wimbledon match into an exhibition of his magic, outclassing Milos Raonic 6-4 6-2 7-6(4) to reach the semi-finals for a record 12th time. The Swiss maestro, 36 next month, played his best tennis of the tournament to dismantle the big-serving Canadian - avenging last year's semi-final defeat in stunning fashion. With defending champion Andy Murray losing earlier on Centre Court to Sam Querrey and Novak Djokovic retiring with an injury against Tomas Berdych, Federer is now overwhelming favorite to become the first man to win the title eight times.  I can't believe it's 100 matches, it's a lot but I'm very happy my body has kept me going all these years,  said Federer who will face Berdych in Friday's semi-finals.  You have to make sure you average is as high as possible every day and I think I'm doing a great job this week.  Related CoverageFighting-fit Federer fears for stricken rivalsRaonic might have had the 140 mph serve in his locker, but Federer owns a magic wand that he used to make the world's sixth best player look like a lumbering also-ran. It was hard not feel sorry for Raonic at times. Usually when a player is taking the kind of beating Federer was handing out on a sunlit Centre Court, the crowd throw their weight behind the underdog. Tennis - Wimbledon - London, Britain - July 12, 2017   Switzerland’s Roger Federer celebrates winning the quarter final match against Canada’s Milos RaonicAndrew CouldridgeThat rule does not apply when it is Federer, king of Wimbledon, inflicting the punishment in the silky manner only the 18-times grand slam champion is capable of. When, to his immense credit, Raonic finally began to threaten in the third set, going 3-0 up in the tiebreak, it was Federer they were cheering for. When he responded with two majestic forehands, one apparently defying physics as it curled around the net post, they were in raptures in the stands and former great Rod Laver smiled in admiration from the Royal Box. Slideshow (11 Images) I was sort of moving on, let's see if he can do it again. He kept doing it,  Raonic told reporters.  He kept a very high gear the whole entire time without giving many real glimpses.  I think that was the most defeating thing.  There was a slightly subdued atmosphere on Centre Court after home favorite Murray had hobbled to defeat against Querrey. But once the old place filled up and Federer hit his stride the British player's defeat was forgotten. Federer struck two rasping backhand winners in the fifth game and raced across the turf to punish Raonic for failing to put away a volley, pummeling a forehand straight through the ducking Canadian to seize a decisive break. Raonic's belief ebbed away at the start of the second set when a careless forehand gifted Federer another break and the third seed went for the jugular, grabbing another break of serve as he sauntered into a two-set lead. Federer was made to sweat a little in the third set, saving four break points at 3-4 as Raonic finally began to hit his groundstrokes with menace. When Raonic opened up an early lead in the tiebreak it looked as though Federer might drop his first set of the tournament, but he responded in style to win seven of the next eight points and earn himself a standing ovation.

The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) said its monthly house price index dropped to +7 in June from +17 in May, its lowest since July last year and below all forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists.  The term 'uncertainty' is featuring more heavily in the feedback we are receiving,  RICS chief economist Simon Rubinsohn said.  This seems to be exerting itself on transaction levels, which are flatlining and may continue to do so.  RICS asked its members about the main reason for slowing property sales. Some 44 percent blamed domestic political uncertainty after Prime Minister Theresa May unexpectedly failed to win a parliamentary majority in a June 8 election. Just 27 percent cited Britain's looming departure from the EU. But Brexit and property taxes were a bigger factor in London, where luxury property in the centre continued to see widespread price falls. Prices also dropped slightly in surrounding areas of southeast England, but rose strongly in most of the rest of England, as well as in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.  The latest results demonstrate the danger, however tempting, of talking about a single housing market across the country,  Rubinsohn said. A shortage of homes for sale remained a problem, too, he said. The number of houses being put up for sale fell for a 16th consecutive month, and estate agents had a record-low amount of property to sell.

The Repeal Bill is central to the government's plan to exit the EU in 2019, providing the mechanism for decades of EU law to be turned into British law, and to enact Brexit by repealing the 1972 legislation that made Britain a member. Its passage through parliament could make or break May's future as prime minister. The election she called last month cost her an outright parliamentary majority and reopened the debate on the nature of Britain's EU exit. Within May's Conservative Party, pro-Brexit lawmakers are fiercely defensive of her plan for a clean break with the EU. Pro-Europeans are looking to extract concessions that soften the divorce terms. Rebellion by either side could derail the legislation and test May's ability to negotiate a compromise or find support from opposition parties. If she fails, her position could swiftly become untenable.  It is one of the most significant pieces of legislation that has ever passed through Parliament and is a major milestone in the process of our withdrawal from the European Union,  Brexit minister David Davis said in a statement The publication of the bill is the first step in a long legislative process, with no formal debate in parliament expected on Thursday. It will be closely examined to see how the government plans to carry out the difficult and time-consuming technical exercise of transposing EU law. Lawmakers have expressed concern that the sheer volume of work created by the shift could limit parliament's ability to scrutinise it effectively and ensure the government is not introducing policy change by the back door. Too Late? The bill will also face scrutiny from British companies, many of which have spent the year since Britons voted to leave the EU trying to figure out how the change will affect their business. A successful shift to British law is crucial for many industries that depend on EU-wide regulation. Davis said the bill would enable Britain to exit the EU with  maximum certainty, continuity and control.  But the financial industry, a major component of Britain's $2.5 trillion economy, is already warning that the government has left it too late to convince them it can strike a deal to soften the impact of Brexit before they start shifting jobs from London. May's attempts to build broad political support for the Brexit plan she set out in January, which involves leaving the EU's single market and prioritising immigration control, have so far fallen on deaf ears. The opposition Labour Party Leader Jeremy Corbyn has committed to Brexit. But, emboldened by a surge in public support for his leftist agenda he has set out his own parallel plan for Brexit, hoping that May's government will fall.

Whether stronger exports can offset a squeeze on consumer demand is the key question for Britain's economy as it grapples with the effect of last year's sharp fall in sterling following the vote to leave the European Union. The Bank of England predicts the overall effect will be modest, and could raise interest rates for the first time in a decade later this year if that continues to be the case. But the BCC - which carries out Britain's biggest quarterly survey of businesses - said economic activity was subdued in the three months to the end of June.  For many businesses growth is static at best, and at worst, beginning to slow,  BCC director-general Adam Marshall said.  The subdued growth picture underlines the importance of getting as much clarity on the Brexit transition as possible, as quickly as possible over the coming months,  he added. Overall, the BCC data fit the pattern of other business surveys in the past week, which have shown weakening investment plans and slowing business activity. British quarterly economic growth tumbled to 0.2 percent in the first three months of this year, and the NIESR economic think tank estimated last week that growth only edged up to 0.3 percent during the second quarter. Despite the gloomy outlook, some measures in the BCC's survey were robust. Manufacturers reported the fastest export growth in three years, while the services sector enjoyed the biggest increase in foreign sales in more than a year. The two sectors were more upbeat about the outlook for total sales over the next 12 months than at any time since last year's vote to leave the EU. However, the BCC said services businesses that relied on British consumers suffered from inflation, which is its highest in nearly four years. Overall, services businesses' domestic sales slipped, as did investment and hiring intentions.  While the manufacturing sector enjoyed a solid quarter, the improvements are from a low base, and the longer-term trends suggests that the sector's contribution to overall UK growth will not be enough to offset weaknesses elsewhere,  the BCC's head of economics, Suren Thiru, said.

The investment plans, which include building trains and trams in Britain, coincide with a three-day state visit to Britain by Spain's King Felipe and Queen Letizia. King Felipe and British trade minister Liam Fox are due to address a UK-Spain business forum in London on Thursday, before the Spanish monarch holds bilateral talks with Prime Minister Theresa May at her Downing Street residence. Britain said the investments would include Spanish manufacturer CAF committing 30 million pounds ($39 million) to build trains and trams at a new factory in Wales, creating 300 jobs, and Spanish infrastructure company Sacyr unveiling plans for a new office in London. Bilateral trade between the two countries was worth 40 billion pounds in 2015, and more than 400 Spanish companies are registered in Britain, the government said.  The sheer scale of Spanish investment in Britain demonstrates Spain's continued confidence in the strength of the UK economy, and shows that we can and will maintain the closest possible relationship,  May said in a statement. The government also highlighted more than 100 million pounds which is being invested in the expansion of Luton Airport, majority owned Spanish airport operator AENA, and the construction of a 26 million pound factory in the West Midlands by Spanish steel producer Gonvarri Steel Services. Away from the financial deals, the Spanish royal visit comes amid tensions over the post-Brexit future of the British territory of Gibraltar, which Spain wants back. The future of Gibraltar, a rock on the southern tip of Spain captured by Britain in 1704, and its 30,000 inhabitants, is set to be a major point of contention in the Brexit talks. During an address to members of both houses of parliament in London on Wednesday, Felipe said he was confident that Spain and Britain could work towards an acceptable arrangement over Gibraltar. The EU and Britain have also yet to agree on guarantees for EU citizens living in the UK and British expats living in other EU countries. More than 300,000 Britons live in Spain, while more than 130,000 Spaniards live in Britain. On Wednesday, Felipe said these citizens had  a legitimate expectation of decent and stable living conditions  and urged the British and Spanish governments to work to ensure the Brexit agreement provided sufficient assurance and certainty. May's office said that during her talks with Felipe she would welcome the contribution that Spanish citizens make to Britain's economy and society.

In its annual Future Energy Scenarios report, the grid operator said it saw a sharp rise in the number of electric vehicles, with sales expected to be more than 90 percent of all cars by mid-century. As a result, electricity demand will increase, driven initially by electric vehicles and later on by heat demand as the pace picks up to decarbonise the heating sector. Peak electricity demand could even rise by as much as 8 GW by 2030 without  smart charging  during off-peak hours and 18 GW by 2050, National Grid said. Peak electricity demand in Britain is currently around 50-55 GW in winter. The 18 GW increase in peak demand would happen in a world which is quite wealthy, where consumers would charge their vehicles at peak times, ignoring electricity tariffs that are cheaper during off-peak hours. In a world where cutting greenhouse gas emissions is a top priority, shared driverless vehicles could potentially make up 50 percent of electric vehicles, National Grid said. With vehicle sharing and off-peak charging patterns, demand might only rise by 6 GW by 2050, it added.  The scenarios are not predictions but they aim to be a catalyst for debate, decision making and change, and provide transparency to the wider industry,  said Marcus Stewart, head of energy insights at National Grid.

The Appalachian state recently took $40 million from its reserve fund and found another roughly $60 million by squeezing cash out of state agency accounts to fill in a revenue shortfall for the last fiscal year, Nick Casey, the governor's chief of staff, told a news conference.  Drawing down these two sources of funds, however, did not create a sufficient cushion to enter the new fiscal year with a balanced budget, Casey said.   As we finish this year, we don't look too good,  he said. The new fiscal year began on July 1.  Lawmakers in West Virginia, which is rated AA-minus by S&P; Global Ratings and Fitch Ratings and has a slightly higher rating of Aa2 from Moody's Investors Service, passed a $4.26 billion state budget in mid-June without the governor's signature.   Justice, a Democrat and longtime agriculture businessman worth about $1.6 billion, refused to veto the bill in order to avoid a government shutdown. The governor had asked for more spending in 2018. Initial overestimates of revenue from personal income taxes, corporate net income taxes and consumer sales taxes were largely to blame for 2017's shortage, Casey said.   As a result of the $11 million gap, residents should expect cuts to public service departments, he said.  The West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources and volunteer fire departments will be the first to face reductions as a result of the gap, Casey said.  Fairs and festivals, and the annual stocking of creeks and rivers for fishing, would also be vulnerable to cutbacks, he said.  When you don't have $11 million, you have to find somewhere to get it,  Casey said. The one  bright spot  of the state's finances has been severance tax collections, paid largely by coal companies mining in the state, which came in about $58 million above estimates in the last four months, Casey said.

Under terms of the deal, Cambuhy Investimentos Ltda, Itaúsa Investimentos SA (ITSA4.SA) and the fund Brasil Warrant will split J&F;'s 86 percent stake in Alpargatas, the filling said. Both had bid 3.3 billion reais for Alpargatas before talks appeared to have collapsed, Reuters reported on Sunday. The much-awaited sale is the first by J&F;, the holding company overseeing the fortune of Brazil's billionaire Batista family, since it was slammed with a record-setting leniency fine linked to a corruption probe. Proceeds from the sale will go to help repay J&F;'s debt and speed up payments on the 10.3 billion-real fine, people told Reuters on Sunday. The filings said the Cambuhy-led group will pay 14.25 reais for each Alpargatas common share and 11.40 reais for each preferred share.

Its shares had surged 56 percent this year on expectations of a sale. Alpargatas also manages a wide array of Brazilian fashion brands including beachwear brand Osklen. Itaúsa oversees the fortune of Brazil's Villela and Setubal families, who control São Paulo-based Itaú Unibanco Holding SA (ITUB4.SA), Latin America's largest bank by assets. Cambuhy is the family office of Brazil's billionaire Moreira Salles family, also a major Itaú shareholder. Reuters first reported the Cambuhy-led bid on June 16.

According to people with knowledge of the situation, J&F;'s owners Joesley and Wesley Batista will use proceeds from the transaction to repay a 2.7 billion-real acquisition financing loan they took with state-controlled lender Caixa Econômica Federal.  The loan is under investigation by Brazil's audit court TCU for potential irregularities. The brothers signed a leniency deal in May after admitting to bribing almost 1,900 politicians to obtain cheap government loans for their businesses.

The groups, including the Natural Resources Defense Council and Earthjustice, argued the agency's June 6 announcement that it would wait to identify areas of the country where smog pollution is especially heavy until it gathered more information and reviewed existing pollution standards was illegal. At issue in the lawsuit is a provision in the Clean Air Act that requires the EPA to decide what levels of smog pollution are acceptable, then identify parts of the country where pollution exceeds those levels and enforce their cleanup. The agency released standards and designations in 2008 and 2015, and was due to update them this year.  Simply put, delay of designations delays the stronger pollution controls Congress mandated to protect people in communities with unhealthy air,  said the lawsuit, filed in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Liz Bowman, a spokeswoman for the EPA said the agency had asked lawyers representing the groups in a phone call on Tuesday to delay filing their suit for two weeks. She said the EPA was still working on the designations and its lawyers believed the suit would be unnecessary once the groups saw the results of the agency's work. Bowman said the groups were reading too much into the delay.  The agency was not going to meet the original deadline for all 50 states,  she said.  This administrator doesn't like being outside the bounds of statutory deadlines so he said extend it. We're continuing our work.      The topic has been a recent source of dispute. Environmental groups and representatives of industries that contribute to  smog, like power plants, sparred in court over whether the previous designations were too lax or too strict. Mustafa Ali, a former assistant associate administrator for environmental justice at the EPA, criticized the delay and said the suit, in which he was not involved, was warranted. If the EPA needed more time to deal with certain states over their designations, the agency could do so without the overall delay, he said.  You can always work with states that are not moving  quickly, you can build some accommodation into the process,  he said.   How long do these communities need to wait? What we're really doing is playing with their lives.  Reporting by Emily Flitter; Editing by Tom Brown","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-environment-lawsuit-idUSL1N1K328S"},

A deal would combine the largest U.S. provider of ambulance services with a leading operator of medical helicopters. It would also help streamline Envision's business after its $10 billion merger with peer AmSurg Corp late last year. KKR has prevailed in the auction for Envision's business with a bid worth around $2 billion, and is in the process of negotiating final terms, the people said on Wednesday. A deal could be announced as early as this month, the people added, cautioning that there is always a possibility that the talks end unsuccessfully. The sources asked not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential. Envision did not immediately respond to a request for comment, while KKR declined to comment. For Air Medical, a combination with American Medical Response (AMR) would allow it to more easily substitute costly helicopter flights with ambulances for shorter trips. The deal will also enable Envision to sharpen its focus on its core business lines of providing services to physician practice groups and operating outpatient surgery centers. AMR has been a source of steady growth for Envision, but has not kept pace with its core provider services business, where Envision is the largest player in the sector. Envision has also been reviewing options for its population health management division, which it said lacks the scale to be as competitive in the space as they would like. It recently terminated the businesses most significant contract.  The provider services market has been rapidly consolidating in recent years, largely in an attempt to keep pace with consolidation among the hospitals they serve. Envision has said it hopes to strengthen its leadership role in the fragmented sector by rolling up smaller competitors and cutting out costs.  The medical transportation sector has also seen significant deal activity in recent months, with buyout firm American Securities acquiring Air Methods, another medical helicopter provider, for $2.5 billion in April.

In what may be one of her last appearances before Congress, Yellen depicted an economy that, while growing slowly, continued to add jobs, benefited from steady household consumption and a recent jump in business investment, and was now being supported  by stronger economic conditions abroad. The Fed  continues to expect that the evolution of the economy will warrant gradual increases in the federal funds rate over time,  Yellen said in her prepared testimony. Reductions in the Fed's portfolio of more than $4 trillion in securities are likely to begin  this year,  she said. But she also noted that given current estimates, the federal funds rate  would not have to rise all that much further  to reach a neutral level that neither encourages nor discourages economic activity. The Fed still feels the economy needs loose, or accommodative, monetary policy, so a lower neutral rate means the Fed may feel compelled to slow the pace of rate hikes down the road.  But for now, Yellen told members of the House Committee on Financial Services, the economy remains strong enough for the Fed to continue to gradually tighten policy. In response to questions from lawmakers, she said she expects the gradual run down of the balance sheet will  play out smoothly  in markets. The reduction in the balance sheet, which will begin slowly as the Fed reinvests only a portion of the holdings that mature each month, will mark the final exit from crisis-related policies. Related CoverageCoast to coast, Fed sees 'slight to moderate' and 'modest to moderate' economyInstant View: Yellen - Economy healthy enough for gradual rate risesEconomy on Even Keel Yellen's past appearances before the House panel have sometimes involved sharp exchanges with lawmakers who think the Fed's influence over the economy has grown too strong. Such lawmakers want policymakers to be guided more closely by a mathematical rule for setting interest rates.  This session was a more sedate meeting, with Committee Chair Jeb Hensarling, an advocate  rules-based  monetary policy, complimenting the Fed for including comparisons of its monetary policy with some of the more common formulas.

BernsteinHer appearance, coming as the Trump administration mulls whether to replace her when her term ends in February, broke little new ground in terms of policy or regulatory changes.  We have a relatively light regulatory agenda at this point,  Yellen said. She confirmed the Fed was reviewing some of the requirements imposed on bank boards of directors following the financial crisis, with any eye toward possibly easing some of them. She also repeated the Fed's strong opposition to proposals that policymakers worry could give elected officials influence over what are supposed to be independent Fed interest rate decisions. Slideshow (2 Images)According to her testimony the economy is on an even keel, near or beyond full employment.  U.S. stocks rose, while yields on Treasury bonds fell and the dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies.  In a separate release, the Fed's latest beige book of reports from regional Fed banks showed  slight to moderate  economic growth across the country. A recent dip in inflation has been of concern among Fed officials who want to see surer progress toward the central bank's 2 percent inflation goal. Yellen, however, ascribed it to  a few unusual reductions in certain categories of prices  that would eventually drop out of the calculation.  The current situation  raises the stakes  for upcoming inflation data, said Jim Vogel, interest rate strategist for FTN Financial in Memphis, Tennessee.  People are going to be very anxious if that was just a statistical glitch...or if it is going to continue.  Otherwise, Yellen said, the economy appeared to be in a virtuous loop of hiring, spending and investment that  should increase resource utilization somewhat further, thereby fostering a stronger pace of wage and price increases.

By David Brunnstrom WASHINGTON (Reuters) - China's ambassador to the United States has said reports of trade growth between his country and North Korea, in spite of international efforts to press Pyongyang to give up its nuclear and missile programs, give  a distorted picture.  Last week U.S. President Donald Trump denounced China's trade with North Korea, saying it had grown almost 40 percent in the first quarter, and cast doubt on whether Beijing was helping to counter the threat from North Korea. Data released in April showed China's trade with North Korea grew 37.4 percent year on year in the first quarter, in spite of a ban on coal imports China announced in February.  This is a distorted picture,  China's ambassador to the United States, Cui Tiankai, said in a speech to a Washington think tank on Monday. Cui said bilateral trade declined in 2015 and 2016, and Chinese imports from North Korea dropped by 41 percent in April and 32 percent in May as a result of the coal import ban. At the same time, Cui stressed that U.N. Security Council sanctions on North Korea did not constitute an embargo.  Normal trade ... is not banned by these sanctions,  he said. The Chinese embassy released a copy of Cui's speech, originally delivered in an off-the-record setting, on Tuesday. Cui said China backed further U.N. action against North Korea for violations of U.N. resolutions such as nuclear tests and launches of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). He did not though make clear whether China believed North Korea's latest missile test last week, which the United States described as a first ICBM test, was of that type of missile. Diplomats say the United States is aiming for a vote within weeks to strengthen U.N. sanctions on North Korea over the test, but Russia has objected to a Security Council condemnation of the launch as a U.S.-drafted statement labeled it an ICBM. Cui said sanctions were necessary, but could not solve the North Korean problem alone. He repeated a call for Washington to back a Chinese  suspension for suspension  proposal under which North Korea would freeze weapons testing in return for suspension of U.S.-South Korean military exercises. Washington says the exercises are needed to maintain defenses against North Korea and U.S. officials say Beijing could face U.S. economic and trade pressure unless it does more to rein in North Korea. Washington is expected to press the issue when senior U.S. and Chinese officials meet on July 19 to discuss bilateral economic issues.

Planned months ago, the U.S. missile defense test over the Pacific Ocean has gained significance after North Korea's July 4 launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) heightened concerns about the threat from Pyongyang. The test was the first-ever of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system against an incoming IRBM, which experts say is a faster and more difficult target to hit than shorter-range missiles.  The U.S. Missile Defense Agency said the IRBM was designed to behave similarly to the kinds of missiles that could threaten the United States.  The successful demonstration of THAAD against an IRBM-range missile threat bolsters the country's defensive capability against developing missile threats in North Korea and other countries,  the Missile Defense Agency said in a statement. The successful THAAD test adds to the credibility of the U.S. military's missile defense program, which has come under intense scrutiny in recent years, including because of test delays and failures. The U.S. Government Accountability Office, a federal watchdog, noted in a May report that the Missile Defense Agency had not previously tested THAAD against an IRBM, despite having deployed the system to the island of Guam, a U.S. territory in the Pacific, in 2013 amid concerns about North Korea's missile program.  That means that, until the latest test, the THAAD system had an unproven capability against IRBMs, missiles that have a range of between 1,800 and 3,100 miles (3,000 to 5,500 km). Guam is approximately 2,100 miles (3,400 km) from North Korea. Related CoverageChina envoy says North Korea trade growth picture 'distorted'In order to hit the mainland United States, North Korea would need to fire an ICBM, which is defined as a missile with a range greater than 3,400 miles (5,500 km).   100 Percent Track Record In the latest test, a THAAD in Kodiak, Alaska, intercepted a ballistic missile target that was air-launched from a C-17 aircraft flying north of Hawaii, the Missile Defense Agency said in a statement. A defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the test took place early on Tuesday. This success leaves THAAD with a 100 percent track record for all 14 intercept attempts since flight testing began just over a decade ago.  Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N), the prime contractor for the THAAD system, said it could intercept incoming missiles both inside and outside the Earth's atmosphere. The United States deployed THAAD to South Korea this year to guard against North Korea's shorter-range missiles. That has  drawn fierce criticism from China, which says the system's powerful radar can probe deep into its territory. Earlier this month Moscow and Beijing, in a joint statement, called on Washington to immediately halt deployment of THAAD in South Korea. The statement said Washington was using North Korea as a pretext to expand its military infrastructure in Asia and risked upsetting the strategic balance of power in the region.   THAAD's success rate in testing is far higher than the one for America's Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) system, which is designed to shoot down an ICBM headed for the U.S. mainland. That GMD system has only a 55 percent success rate over the life of the program, stoking fierce criticism from groups including the Union of Concerned Scientists, a non-profit science advocacy group.  But advocates say the technology has improved dramatically in recent years. The GMD system successfully shot down an incoming, simulated North Korean ICBM in a test in May.   That led the Pentagon to upgrade its assessment of the United States' ability to defend against a small number of ICBMs, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters. A ground-based missile defense system, THAAD is designed to shoot down short-, medium- and intermediate-range ballistic missiles. John Schilling, a contributor to 38 North, a Washington-based North Korea monitoring project, downplayed the idea that THAAD might be seen as a backup to hit a longer range ICBM, saying that THAAD was not designed to hit missiles traveling so fast.  To engage an ICBM with THAAD would be like asking a high school baseball player to hit a fastball from a major-league pitcher - literally out of his league,  Schilling said. The Missile Defense Agency told Congress in June that it planned to deliver 52 more THAAD interceptors to the U.S. Army between October 2017 and September 2018, bringing total deliveries to 210 since May 2011.

The moves are part of a push to sell assets to pay down debt Cenovus took to help fund the C$16.8 billion purchase of oil and gas businesses from ConocoPhillips (COP.N). Cenovus is working with Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD.TO) to sell Weyburn, and with Credit Suisse (CSGN.S) and Scotiabank (BNS.TO) to sell the Palliser assets, two people said this week, declining to be named as the appointments are not public. The company last month identified Weyburn and Palliser as additional assets it would look to sell and raised its total divestiture target to C$4 billion to C$5 billion, from C$3.6 billion earlier.  Cenovus expects to generate as much as C$1.5 billion for Weyburn and about C$1 billion for Palliser, the people said. The deals could be announced in the fourth quarter, the company has said. If successful, these divestitures could help Cenovus reach up to half of its asset sales targets. Cenovus and Credit Suisse declined to comment, while TD and Scotiabank did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comments. The Weyburn assets in southern Saskatchewan are attractive because of their light oil output and low decline, characteristics that might lead to a robust bidding process, the people said. Located in southeast Alberta, the Palliser block is a conventional tight-oil asset. Cenovus said last year it has identified 700 drilling locations in the block with what it said are high-return potentials. The company is also selling its Pelican Lake and Suffield conventional oil and gas assets.  Cenovus is under pressure because of the debt it incurred with the transformational acquisition of oil and gas assets. Its share price is down about 47 percent since the deal was announced in March, while the company said last month that Chief Executive Brian Ferguson – who had championed the transaction – would retire. Some investors have questioned whether the company can meet its asset sales targets, given that other oil firms are seeking to sell Canadian assets.

In remarks to the House Committee on Financial Services, Yellen said the U.S. economy is strong enough to absorb further gradual rate increases along with the slow wind-down of the Fed's massive bond portfolio. The testimony depicted an economy that is growing, albeit  slowly, and continues to add jobs as it benefits from steady household consumption and a recent jump in business investment. Given current estimates, the federal funds rate  would not have to rise all that much further  to reach a neutral level that neither encourages nor discourages economic activity, Yellen said in her prepared testimony. Equities rose on the view the Fed's monetary policy is not going to be as aggressive as some had anticipated, said Larry Hatheway, chief economist at asset management firm GAM.

ANZ has been pursuing a sale of its 24 percent stake in its Malaysian affiliate AMMB Holdings (AmBank) since early last year as part of a strategy to divest minority stakes in Asia and as AmBank was dragged into a wide-ranging corruption scandal at state fund 1MDB. In June, RHB Bank and AmBank said they were starting merger talks, in Malaysia's biggest ever banking deal. As part of the all-share deal, valued at about $9 billion, RHB is looking to acquire AmBank and the two banks are in exclusive talks until the end of August. ANZ's stake is expected to be roughly 10 percent in the merged entity. Sources said ANZ is in talks to sell that stake to Malaysian retirement fund KWAP, which already owns small stakes in both RHB and AmBank. Both firms have  agreed in principle  to the deal at a price equivalent to one time book value of AmBank, said one of the sources.  KWAP has always had an aspiration to hold a significant investment in a financial institution. KWAP had considered purchasing part of ANZ's stake two years ago but was not agreeable to the pricing,  said the source. Last week, Malaysia's Star newspaper quoted KWAP CEO Wan Kamaruzaman Wan Ahmad as saying the fund was keen on buying ANZ's stake after the proposed RHB and AmBank merger. KWAP and AmBank declined to comment.  We will decline to comment on market speculation,  an ANZ spokesman said. ANZ's stake is also drawing interest from another Malaysian institutional investor, said the source. The sources declined to be identified as the discussions were private. RHB has indicated to analysts that it would pay AmBank shareholders a one-time multiple of the latter's book value. 1mdb Shadow ANZ wanted to exit the stake partly after AmBank was dragged into a political scandal linked to state fund 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB) and Prime Minister Najib Razak, sources have previously said. In 2015, AmBank was slapped with a 53.7 million ringgit fine by Malaysian regulators for breaching financial regulations. Najib has been buffeted by allegations of graft, in particular by revelations of the transfer of hundreds of millions of dollars into his AmBank account in 2013. The Prime Minister has denied any wrongdoing. If the RHB-AmBank merger wins the approval of shareholders, the stakes of other key shareholders will also decline in the merged entity. Abu Dhabi's Aabar Investments, with a 17.8 percent stake in RHB, would hold 10.3 percent, according to a note by Maybank Research. The Abu Dhabi firm, which has been linked to the 1MDB scandal, merged into Mubadala last year. A separate source close to Mubadala said the firm wants to eventually sell Aabar's stake in RHB, but will wait until it gets a  fair  price. Mubadala declined to comment.

This year's race, the halfway point in the season, takes place on Sunday. Silverstone had a crowd of 139,000 on race day last year, the biggest of any current grand prix, but BRDC chairman John Grant said that even with that attendance it still could not make a profit due to high hosting fees.

Lewis feels that he is in such a tough championship fight that he needed the days off after Austria,  Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff explained to the crowd at the F1 Live event in Trafalgar Square.  But you can see him in Silverstone.  Hamilton had announced on social media that he was taking a two-day break, posting a picture of him and friends on the steps of his private jet. He is due to face the media at Silverstone on Thursday.  Mention of the country's most successful racing driver, a man with 56 wins to his name and huge support who will be favorite for a fourth successive British Grand Prix victory on Sunday, drew some boos. Hamilton was the only absentee of the 20 drivers who performed tyre-smoking spins, or  donuts , in their cars on individual runs along Whitehall to the crowded square and back. Ferrari's championship leader Sebastian Vettel, 20 points clear of the Briton after last weekend's Austrian Grand Prix, had plenty of fans in the crowd and was not shy in his title rival's absence.  I don't know why he's not here,  smiled the German, who drove into Hamilton in a  road rage  incident in Azerbaijan last month, when it was suggested to him that maybe Hamilton did not fancy sharing the stage with him.  We left some marks...it's great fun to go so close to the people. You can see the cheering, waving. It's been really fun. I'd love to do more laps but we'll wait for the weekend.   Jenson Button, Britain's 2009 world champion, drove fashion model Naomi Campbell in a two-seater while Belgian Stoffel Vandoorne gave the fans a glimpse of the late Ayrton Senna's 1991 McLaren. Jackie Stewart, Britain's only other three-times world champion, was also among the guests while Mercedes' retired 2016 world champion Nico Rosberg flew in from Switzerland. The event, organized by the sport's new owners Liberty Media, was the first time Formula One cars had driven in London since 2004.  The sport's all about the fans,  said Formula One's extravagantly mustachioed chairman Chase Carey on an evening of cars and music as well as events to showcase the sport's educational activities.

The moves are part of a push to sell assets to pay down debt Cenovus took to help fund the C$16.8 billion purchase of oil and gas businesses from ConocoPhillips (COP.N). Cenovus is working with Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD.TO) to sell Weyburn, and with Credit Suisse (CSGN.S) and Scotiabank (BNS.TO) to sell the Palliser assets, two people said this week, declining to be named as the appointments are not public. The company last month identified Weyburn and Palliser as additional assets it would look to sell and raised its total divestiture target to C$4 billion to C$5 billion, from C$3.6 billion earlier.  Cenovus expects to generate as much as C$1.5 billion for Weyburn and about C$1 billion for Palliser, the people said. The deals could be announced in the fourth quarter, the company has said. If successful, these divestitures could help Cenovus reach up to half of its asset sales targets. Cenovus and Credit Suisse declined to comment, while TD and Scotiabank did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comments. The Weyburn assets in southern Saskatchewan are attractive because of their light oil output and low decline, characteristics that might lead to a robust bidding process, the people said. Located in southeast Alberta, the Palliser block is a conventional tight-oil asset. Cenovus said last year it has identified 700 drilling locations in the block with what it said are high-return potentials. The company is also selling its Pelican Lake and Suffield conventional oil and gas assets.  Cenovus is under pressure because of the debt it incurred with the transformational acquisition of oil and gas assets. Its share price is down about 47 percent since the deal was announced in March, while the company said last month that Chief Executive Brian Ferguson – who had championed the transaction – would retire. Some investors have questioned whether the company can meet its asset sales targets, given that other oil firms are seeking to sell Canadian assets.

Randal Quarles, a former Wall Street lawyer and U.S. Treasury official who now runs an investment firm, was part of a team that invested in troubled or failed banks while he was an executive at private-equity firm Carlyle Group LP (CG.O). Those investments earned hundreds of millions of dollars for Carlyle, profits that would not have been possible without government support. A spokesman for Quarles did not respond to a request for comment. A spokesman for Carlyle declined to comment. Democrats including Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown have said they intend to scrutinize Quarles' ties to Wall Street during his confirmation hearing. Senator Elizabeth Warren described him as  straight off the Wall Street assembly line  in announcing her opposition in a statement. But both the White House and Congress are controlled by Republicans, who have the ability to approve Trump's nominees with a simple majority after Senate rules were changed in 2013. Under previous rules, the party in power would have needed at least 60 votes. Quarles is viewed by many policy analysts as a business-friendly pick who benefits from having experience in the federal government and his business ties are unlikely to be viewed by senior senators his Wall Street ties as a handicap.   Profiting in the markets isn't a scarlet letter in this Congress,  said Isaac Boltansky, director of policy research at Compass Point Trading & Research LLC, in Washington. Before launching The Cynosure Group in 2014, Quarles was a partner and managing director at Carlyle. While there, he played a key role in making a $75 million investment in Boston Private Financial Holdings Inc (BPFH.O), and was also part of a group that decided to jointly acquire failed lender BankUnited Inc (BKU.N) from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp (FDIC), alongside private equity peers Blackstone Group LP (BX.N), Centerbridge Partners LP and WL Ross & Co, as well as banker John Kanas. Months after Carlyle's equity infusion, Boston Private received a $150 million bailout from the Treasury Department, which it later repaid. Those taxpayer funds helped the firm weather the financial crisis, and allowed Carlyle to sell off its stake over time for a total of $150 million, effectively doubling its money, according to a Reuters review of share sales the firm disclosed in regulatory filings. The FDIC had absorbed BankUnited's losses at an estimated cost of $4.9 billion before selling healthier assets to the private equity consortium for $945 million. BankUnited later went public, with Carlyle selling shares worth around $428 million in portions through 2014, according to Reuters' analysis of its disclosures. The tallies do not account for dividends or other undisclosed costs. Carlyle would not provide precise numbers for returns on those investments. Involvement with taxpayer bailouts helped sink the earlier nomination of General Electric Co (GE.N) executive David Nason for the Federal Reserve supervisory position. Nason withdrew from vetting after Republicans criticized him for having structured the bailout program inside the Treasury Department during the Bush administration. But Wilbur Ross, whose WL Ross & Co was part of the consortium that invested in BankUnited alongside Carlyle, successfully became U.S. Commerce Secretary. Quarles' history on Wall Street may be a talking point during his confirmation hearings, but it is unlikely to bring down his nomination, lobbyists and financial regulatory lawyers said.  At the end of the day, it's really a 'nothingburger,'  said Bob Kurucza, a partner in Goodwin Procter's financial industry and investment management practice.

The state, which continues to face major financial challenges, still risks becoming the first U.S. state to be rated junk by other credit rating agencies.  Through a combination of spending cuts and tax increases, the budget package brings the state's revenue and expenditure base much closer to structural alignment and reduces the near-term uncertainty that had come to characterize its financial operations,  the credit rating agency said in a statement.  Besides affirming the lowest level investment grade rating for Illinois, S&P; also gave the rating a stable outlook. But it warned that outlook could be short-lived if the state does not implement a plan included in the fiscal 2018 budget to begin shrinking a bill backlog that ballooned to $15 billion during the unprecedented two-year political impasse. Related CoverageFactbox: Five U.S. states face budget uncertainty in new fiscal year The state will almost certainly suffer an extended fiscal hangover from the impasse, not least from its record level of unpaid bills, which will be a drain on its future resources,  S&P; noted. The $36 billion budget for the fiscal year that began July 1 marked the first for Illinois since 2015. The spending plan calls for the issuance of up to $6 billion of 12-year bonds, along with borrowing or tapping money from various state accounts to put an $8 billion dent in the backlog.  Aided by some Republican votes, the Democratic-controlled legislature last Thursday overrode Republican Governor Bruce Rauner's veto of the spending plan and a $5 billion income rate hike.  Democratic House Speaker Michael Madigan said S&P;'s action signals the budget is  an important step in the right direction.  He also expressed the hope that Rauner will work with lawmakers to address lingering fiscal challenges  rather than rejecting compromise by turning further to the extreme right.”  There was no immediate comment on S&P; from the governor, who on Monday announced hiring the president of conservative think-tank Illinois Policy Institute as his new chief of staff.  S&P; said the new budget does not comprehensively address Illinois' $130 billion unfunded pension liability but incorporates a $1.4 billion drop in the state's fiscal 2018 pension contributions. The decrease is mainly due to a new five-year smoothing of higher contributions resulting from actuarial changes by the state's five retirement systems. S&P; called that move  a cost deferral more than a genuine expenditure reduction.  It also said the budget's banking on $500 million from the creation of a hybrid pension plan for new hires  may prove premature.  S&P; affirmed the AA-minus rating on Build Illinois sales tax revenue bonds and BB-plus rating on the state's appropriation-backed debt, which includes Chicago motor fuel tax bonds.  Illinois remains under review by Moody's Investors Service, which rates the state Baa3, one notch above junk, and by Fitch Ratings, which has the state at BBB, two notches above junk.

In his first major address since becoming chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) earlier this year, Jay Clayton laid out his regulatory philosophy for how he plans to run the agency and said the SEC staff was working to prepare proposals aimed at reforming the rules on disclosure. In the speech, delivered at the Economic Club of New York, details about the specific regulations that he would like to adopt or amend were scant. But his comments broadly called for efforts to scale back unnecessary corporate disclosures, reduce compliance burdens on small- and mid-sized companies, ramp up the enforcement division's focus on protecting retail investors from run-of-the-mill frauds, and taking better care to retrospectively review SEC rules to ensure they are having the desired effect. Such efforts would be in line with steps the SEC took late last month, when it moved to allow all public companies to file paperwork confidentially for initial public offerings.  While there are many factors that drive the decision of whether to be a public company, increased disclosure and other burdens may render alternatives for raising capital, such as the private markets, increasingly attractive to companies that only a decade ago would have been all but certain candidates for the public markets,  he said. In one case that may reflect Clayton's enforcement approach to protecting retail investors, the SEC on Wednesday charged 13 people with involvement in a Long Island, New York scam that cajoled dozens of elderly and other investors into buying penny stocks, bilking them out of more than $10 million. Clayton's comments are likely to be seen as welcome news to corporate lobbying groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which has long criticized an array of SEC disclosure rules for cluttering up corporate filings with unnecessary information. The Chamber has often sued the SEC over rules requiring disclosures that it said were not material, and has staunchly lobbied Congress to beat back other measures championed by pension funds, unions and progressive-leaning groups. Jay Clayton, Chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (S.E.C.) speaks to the Economic Club of New York in New York City, U.S., July 12, 2017.Brendan McDermidThe Chamber declined to comment. Clayton appeared on Wednesday to echo some of their concerns generally, lamenting that lawmakers and regulators have  significantly expanded the scope of required disclosures beyond the core concept of materiality.  He also urged companies to apply to the SEC for requests to modify what they are required to include in their routine financial reporting, a process that is allowed under current SEC rules. Slideshow (3 Images)Clayton's plan to scale back unnecessary disclosures could spark concerns among progressive groups pushing for new rules, particularly those who support requiring public companies to provide investors with information about their political spending. A petition submitted to the SEC in 2011 calling for a political spending rule garnered a record number of signatures, but to date, the agency has not acted on it. Lisa Gilbert, the vice president of legislative affairs for Public Citizen, a non-profit watchdog group in support of the rule, said Clayton's interest in expanding the menu of public investment options for retail investors means she hopes he will be open to considering it.  I assume he will remain open-minded to what people are asking his agency to do,  she said. In addition to his comments on public company requirements, Clayton also said he plans to have the SEC launch a new fixed income market structure advisory committee to scrutinize the current rules and identify potential reforms. Clayton said the SEC will also consider a pilot program in coming months to study the impact of the fees and rebates that exchanges charge and provide to brokers.

The three targeted neighborhoods are in Manhattan, the Bronx and Brooklyn. Rats are seen as a public health threat as carriers of disease, and as a plague on the quality of life. Since the beginning of 2017, the New York City Health Department has received more than 10,000 complaints of rat sightings, and more than 15 percent of the more than 24,000 properties inspected in Manhattan, Brooklyn and the Bronx showed  Active Rat Signs,  the mayor's office said.  “We refuse to accept rats as a normal part of living in New York City,” Mayor Bill de Blasio said in a statement. The plan will begin to roll out in September, and multiple city agencies, including the Sanitation, Parks and Health departments, will be involved. Most of the money will be spent on improvements in public housing apartment buildings, replacing dirt basement floors with concrete “rat pads” and installing solar trash compactors with a  mail-box  opening to replace the 20-year-old compactors now in use. Wire waste baskets on city streets will be replaced with new steel ones. Both the new trash compactors and new trash baskets will dramatically diminish rats’ access to food sources. “The best way to eliminate rats is to deprive them of food, including garbage in homes and litter on New York City streets,  Sanitation Commissioner Kathryn Garcia said in the statement. The city had cut its budget for rodent control programs by $1.5 million in 2010 to help reduce its overall deficit, but four years later, with estimates of 2 million rats sharing space with the city's population of 8 million, the Health Department started a $3.5 million program targeting rat colonies.

The decrease is mainly due to a new five-year smoothing of higher contributions resulting from actuarial changes by the state's five retirement systems. S&P; called that move  a cost deferral more than a genuine expenditure reduction.  It also said the budget's banking on $500 million from the creation of a hybrid pension plan for new hires  may prove premature.

Wray, nominated by Trump on June 7 to replace the fired James Comey as Federal Bureau of Investigation director, sought to stake out independence from the president and protect the agency from partisan political influence. Wray even said it would be  highly unlikely  he would agree to meet Trump in a one-on-one situation, as Comey reluctantly did. Wray, who seemed headed for U.S. Senate approval to fill the 10-year post, testified during a 4 1/2-hour hour Judiciary Committee confirmation hearing amid an uproar in Washington over 2016 emails released on Tuesday involving the president's son, Donald Trump Jr. The emails showed the Republican president's son agreeing last year to meet a woman he was told was a Russian government lawyer who might have damaging information about Democratic White House rival Hillary Clinton as part of Moscow's official support for his father. Wray deflected specific questions from Republican Senator Lindsey Graham about the president's son's emails, saying he had not read them. But Wray said,  Any threats or effort to interfere with our election from any nation-state or any non-state actor is the kind of thing the FBI would want to know.  Trump's son did not notify the FBI and wrote  I love it  about the Russian's offer of information on Clinton. Trump fired Comey on May 9, igniting a political firestorm, and later cited the  Russia thing  as his reason. The Justice Department eight days later named Robert Mueller to serve as special counsel to investigate alleged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential race to help Trump win and potential collusion between Moscow and Trump associates. The Russia matter has dogged Trump's first six months in office. Wray said he had no reason to doubt the U.S. intelligence community's conclusion that Russia interfered in part by hacking and releasing emails damaging to Clinton, a claim Moscow denies. Wray worked at the Justice Department under Republican former President George W. Bush when Comey was deputy attorney general and Mueller was FBI director. Wray also represented New Jersey Governor Chris Christie in a political scandal. Trump has called the Russia probe a  witch hunt.   I do not consider Director Mueller to be on a witch hunt,  Wray told Graham. Wray said he was  very committed  to supporting Mueller's investigation, calling him a  consummate straight shooter and somebody I have enormous respect for.  Christopher Wray testifies before a Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation hearing on his nomination to be the next FBI director on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., July 12, 2017.Carlos BarriaDemocratic Senator Dianne Feinstein asked Wray to inform the committee  if you learn about any machinations to tamper with  Mueller's probe.  Understood,  Wray responded. No Loyalty Oath Wray said no one at the White House had asked that he pledge loyalty to Trump, as Comey said the president demanded of him on Jan. 26. Wray said he would not give such an assurance if asked. Slideshow (7 Images) My loyalty is to the Constitution, to the rule of law and to the mission of the FBI. And no one asked me for any kind of loyalty oath at any point during this process, and I sure as heck didn't offer one,  Wray said. Comey previously told the same committee Trump pressed him in a one-on-one session to drop the FBI investigation into former national security advisor Michael Flynn's ties to Russia. Comey said he felt he was fired in a bid by Trump to undercut the Russia probe. Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy asked Wray,  If the president asks you to do something unlawful or unethical, what do you say?   First, I would try to talk him out of it. And if that failed, I would resign,  Wray replied. The allegation involving Trump pressing Comey on Feb. 14 over the Flynn probe raised questions about whether Trump's behavior amounted to obstruction of justice, a potential issue in any potential future effort in Congress to impeach the president and remove him from office. Wray sought to differentiate himself from Comey. Wray was asked about Comey's July 2016 news conference announcing that no criminal charges were planned against Clinton over her use of a private email server to handle classified information but faulting her conduct.  I can't imagine a situation where as FBI director I would be giving a press conference on an uncharged individual, much less talk in detail about it,  Wray testified. Graham questioned Wray about a January report by the U.S. news organization Politico that a Ukrainian-American operative who was consulting for the Democratic National Committee had met with Ukrainian embassy officials in Washington in a bid to help Clinton and expose links between Trump, top campaign aide Paul Manafort and Russia. Wray said it would be wrong for Ukraine to meddle in the election and  I'd be happy to dig into it.

The clause calls for an investigation should any board director be accused of sexual harassment. If it is found that there was  reasonable probability  that an incident occurred, the director would be removed. Sexual harassment by startup investors is in the spotlight in Silicon Valley after revelations of sexual misconduct led to the resignation of top partners at venture firms 500 Startups and Binary Capital.  We wanted to create a culture of inclusion and respect supported by board members who shared those values,  said Bergman, whose company's technology helps companies meet compliance mandates, in an email.  That's why we created a mechanism that forces an investor to replace the assigned director on our board should sexual harassment occur.  Bergman proposed Integris' anti-harassment clause after she witnessed an accusation first-hand. In her last days as a principal at the Seattle venture capital firm Ignition Partners in March 2016, Bergman received an email accusing a partner of publicly groping a 20-year-old staffer at a happy hour event. That partner, Frank Artale, resigned as managing director this week at Ignition's request after it  learned of a complaint of misconduct  on July 5, the firm said late Tuesday, citing that allegation and the 2016 incident.  While the investigation did not substantiate the allegations, it did indicate that he demonstrated poor judgment, which we addressed with him,  Ignition said in a statement. Integris raised money from Ignition and three other venture firms following the 2016 accusation. Bergman, a former Microsoft Corp product manager, declined to comment on whether the Artale case influenced her, but called her company's anti-harassment clause  good corporate governance  that she hoped would serve as a model for other organizations. Integris' policy is a rarity, but other startups are moving in that direction. Wizeline, a San Francisco firm whose roadmap software is used by other tech companies, in May adopted a policy that calls for an investigation anytime someone reports sexual harassment. Employees found to have violated the policy will be fired regardless of their position, said Sung Hae Kim, vice president of people operations at Wizeline.  There's no special treatment.  Among venture capitalist firms, Foundry Group said it would enforce a  zero tolerance policy  on harassment at any company or venture firms in which it has invested. Allegations will result in immediate investigations, firm co-founder Brad Feld wrote in a June blog. It remains to be seen how these policies will be enforced, but they are a good start, said Lisa Wang, co-founder of SheWorx, a collective of female entrepreneurs. SheWorx is developing an online database for entrepreneurs to report unethical behavior by investors.  These are the types of tangible actions that are actually going to create change because there are real consequences for bad behavior,  Wang said.  But it's one thing to have policies. It's another thing to consistently follow through with them. ","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/startups-sexualdiscrimination-idUSL1N1K32DS"},

In raising rates for the first time in seven years, and for the first time on his watch, Poloz said policymakers will now look to data to decide when they can hike again, and urged financial markets to do the same.  For us the ideal setting is where everybody is looking at the same data, and everybody is coming to a similar understanding of what's going on and wouldn't be hanging on to the bank's every word,  Poloz told a news conference. But with anemic inflation data pointing away from an interest rate increase, analysts said they will need hints from the central bank to determine what the data means to policymakers. Especially as key data, including on inflation and wages, leading into Wednesday's decision did not suggest a July hike was imminent until a flurry of central bank speeches and interviews in late June guided markets to expect one.  It's not how I interpret the data, it is how they interpret the data,  said senior rates strategist Andrew Kelvin at TD Securities, which had expected the bank to hold rates steady rather than hike because the Consumer Price Index (CPI) had shown subdued inflation.  As much as we are all looking at the same data and there is this ideal that we can just form the same conclusion ... it's very clear that markets find the bank's comments to be a more compelling guide than any evolution in the data, particularly when you look at where CPI is.  The bank raised interest rates by 25 basis points to 0.75 percent on Wednesday. While the bank used its quarterly monetary policy report on Wednesday to explain how it expects inflation pressures to build, Poloz also said it has adopted a habit of using a speech between policy-setting meetings to describe how it sees the latest data, acknowledging it can't rely on data alone to guide markets.  I think they probably learned a little bit of a lesson here,  said Brett Ryan, senior U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank in New York.  It would serve them well ... to do a little bit better job on communicating to the market what their reactions are to some of the near-term data.

Researchers analyzed data from a large sample of children and found those whose mothers took antidepressant medications while pregnant were no more likely to be diagnosed with intellectual disability than those who weren't exposed to antidepressants in the womb.  There has certainly been a lot of reports about associations between taking medication - particularly psychiatric medication - during pregnancy and various outcomes,  said Dr. Alexander Kolevzon, of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. Kolevzon and colleagues write in JAMA Psychiatry that antidepressant use in pregnancy has been linked to shorter pregnancies and lower birth weights. Some studies have also tied the medications to an increased risk of autism. People with intellectual disability have an IQ below 70 and trouble with everyday tasks, they note. The condition also sometimes occurs with autism. To see if there might be an increased risk of intellectual disability after exposure to antidepressant medications in the womb, the researchers analyzed data on all children born in Sweden in 2006 and 2007.  Of the 179,007 children included in the study, about 2 percent were exposed to antidepressants in the womb. Overall, 0.9 percent of children exposed to the drugs were diagnosed with an intellectual disability over the next eight years, compared to 0.5 percent of children not exposed to the medications. After the researchers took other factors into account, like parents' ages, education levels and the mother's history of depression, they found that the increase in risk in the exposed children might have been due to chance. Even without adjusting for those other factors, Kolevzon said, the small increased risk among children exposed to antidepressants should not concern mothers. The researchers also looked at whether risk differed by the type of antidepressant taken in pregnancy, but they found no difference.  In our particular study, the type of medication didn’t seem to matter,  Kolevzon told Reuters Health. Based on the findings, he said, any increased risk is likely tied to other factors like parents' ages and the mother's history of depression.  If there is a risk, it’s not driven by the medication alone and there are other factors that are contributing,  said Kolevzon.  Those may be factors the mother can’t control.

In his first major address since becoming chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) earlier this year, Jay Clayton laid out his regulatory philosophy for how he plans to run the agency and said the SEC staff was working to prepare proposals aimed at reforming the rules on disclosure. In the speech, delivered at the Economic Club of New York, details about the specific regulations that he would like to adopt or amend were scant. But his comments broadly called for efforts to scale back unnecessary corporate disclosures, reduce compliance burdens on small- and mid-sized companies, ramp up the enforcement division's focus on protecting retail investors from run-of-the-mill frauds, and taking better care to retrospectively review SEC rules to ensure they are having the desired effect. Such efforts would be in line with steps the SEC took late last month, when it moved to allow all public companies to file paperwork confidentially for initial public offerings.  While there are many factors that drive the decision of whether to be a public company, increased disclosure and other burdens may render alternatives for raising capital, such as the private markets, increasingly attractive to companies that only a decade ago would have been all but certain candidates for the public markets,  he said. In one case that may reflect Clayton's enforcement approach to protecting retail investors, the SEC on Wednesday charged 13 people with involvement in a Long Island, New York scam that cajoled dozens of elderly and other investors into buying penny stocks, bilking them out of more than $10 million. Clayton's comments are likely to be seen as welcome news to corporate lobbying groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which has long criticized an array of SEC disclosure rules for cluttering up corporate filings with unnecessary information. The Chamber has often sued the SEC over rules requiring disclosures that it said were not material, and has staunchly lobbied Congress to beat back other measures championed by pension funds, unions and progressive-leaning groups. The Chamber declined to comment. Clayton appeared on Wednesday to echo some of their concerns generally, lamenting that lawmakers and regulators have  significantly expanded the scope of required disclosures beyond the core concept of materiality.  He also urged companies to apply to the SEC for requests to modify what they are required to include in their routine financial reporting, a process that is allowed under current SEC rules. Clayton's plan to scale back unnecessary disclosures could spark concerns among progressive groups pushing for new rules, particularly those who support requiring public companies to provide investors with information about their political spending. A petition submitted to the SEC in 2011 calling for a political spending rule garnered a record number of signatures, but to date, the agency has not acted on it. Lisa Gilbert, the vice president of legislative affairs for Public Citizen, a non-profit watchdog group in support of the rule, said Clayton's interest in expanding the menu of public investment options for retail investors means she hopes he will be open to considering it.  I assume he will remain open-minded to what people are asking his agency to do,  she said. In addition to his comments on public company requirements, Clayton also said he plans to have the SEC launch a new fixed income market structure advisory committee to scrutinize the current rules and identify potential reforms. Clayton said the SEC will also consider a pilot program in coming months to study the impact of the fees and rebates that exchanges charge and provide to brokers.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-sec-regulation-idUSL1N1K31FC"},

By then, Yan had made multiple profitable trades in Stillwater's stock using a brokerage account he established in the name of his mother in China, the criminal complaint said. Shortly before the deal was announced, Yan conducted online research related to insider trading, searching for how the SEC detects unusual trading and accessing several articles about insider trading, the complaint said. After the companies announced their proposed merger on Dec. 9, Yan began selling Stillwater call options he had purchased, making a profit of $109,420, the complaint said. The case is U.S. v. Yan, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 17-mj-1073.

(Reuters) - A former al Qaeda foot soldier's appeal of his Guantanamo Bay war crimes conviction stalled on Wednesday as U.S. attorneys clashed over his legal representation in a test of the military tribunal system. The dispute halted a fact-finding hearing at a military base outside Washington about whether Ibrahim al Qosi, 57, who reportedly rejoined al Qaeda after his 2012 release from Guantanamo Bay, was an enemy belligerent. Qosi, a cook and occasional driver for al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, pleaded guilty in 2010 before a military commission at the Guantanamo Bay prison in Cuba. He was transferred to his native Sudan after completing a reduced term. The head of the Guantanamo legal defense team had appointed two lawyers to appeal his conviction for conspiring with al Qaeda and providing material support to terrorism to a military appeals court. The tribunal, the Court of Military Commission Review, had sent the case back to a lower military court to demonstrate whether Qosi actually wanted to appeal and to determine whether he had taken up arms against the United States. Prosecutors argued on Wednesday that only Suzanne Lachelier, Qosi's original attorney and one of the lawyers to file the appeal, was empowered to represent him there. Qosi also may not be aware that an appeal was under way, they said.  A unilateral decision by the defense (to appoint attorneys for Qosi) is not enough to pursue the case,  Air Force Major Charles Dunn told Judge Army Colonel James Pohl. Defense lawyers said legal rules allowed them to start a case to clear Qosi's name even though they had had no contact with him. Pohl said he would ask the appeals court to clarify its March order that Lachelier and her colleague Mary McCormick get Qosi's assent to act as his attorney. Lachelier testified on Wednesday that she had an unspecified conflict of interest in the lower court and could not represent Qosi on the question of whether he was an enemy belligerent. Defense lawyer Michael Schwartz told reporters after the hearing that the delay was to be expected in a military tribunal system set up to try suspected militants outside the normal civilian courts.  The reality of this dilemma is that we're in new territory. This has never been done,  he said.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-guantanamo-appeal-idUSL1N1K32C7"},

In his first major address since becoming chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) earlier this year, Jay Clayton laid out his regulatory philosophy for how he plans to run the agency and said the SEC staff was working to prepare proposals aimed at reforming the rules on disclosure. In the speech, delivered at the Economic Club of New York, details about the specific regulations that he would like to adopt or amend were scant. But his comments broadly called for efforts to scale back unnecessary corporate disclosures, reduce compliance burdens on small- and mid-sized companies, ramp up the enforcement division's focus on protecting retail investors from run-of-the-mill frauds, and taking better care to retrospectively review SEC rules to ensure they are having the desired effect. Such efforts would be in line with steps the SEC took late last month, when it moved to allow all public companies to file paperwork confidentially for initial public offerings.  While there are many factors that drive the decision of whether to be a public company, increased disclosure and other burdens may render alternatives for raising capital, such as the private markets, increasingly attractive to companies that only a decade ago would have been all but certain candidates for the public markets,  he said. In one case that may reflect Clayton's enforcement approach to protecting retail investors, the SEC on Wednesday charged 13 people with involvement in a Long Island, New York scam that cajoled dozens of elderly and other investors into buying penny stocks, bilking them out of more than $10 million. Clayton's comments are likely to be seen as welcome news to corporate lobbying groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which has long criticized an array of SEC disclosure rules for cluttering up corporate filings with unnecessary information. The Chamber has often sued the SEC over rules requiring disclosures that it said were not material, and has staunchly lobbied Congress to beat back other measures championed by pension funds, unions and progressive-leaning groups. Jay Clayton, Chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (S.E.C.) speaks to the Economic Club of New York in New York City, U.S., July 12, 2017.Brendan McDermidThe Chamber declined to comment. Clayton appeared on Wednesday to echo some of their concerns generally, lamenting that lawmakers and regulators have  significantly expanded the scope of required disclosures beyond the core concept of materiality.  He also urged companies to apply to the SEC for requests to modify what they are required to include in their routine financial reporting, a process that is allowed under current SEC rules. Slideshow (3 Images)Clayton's plan to scale back unnecessary disclosures could spark concerns among progressive groups pushing for new rules, particularly those who support requiring public companies to provide investors with information about their political spending. A petition submitted to the SEC in 2011 calling for a political spending rule garnered a record number of signatures, but to date, the agency has not acted on it. Lisa Gilbert, the vice president of legislative affairs for Public Citizen, a non-profit watchdog group in support of the rule, said Clayton's interest in expanding the menu of public investment options for retail investors means she hopes he will be open to considering it.  I assume he will remain open-minded to what people are asking his agency to do,  she said. In addition to his comments on public company requirements, Clayton also said he plans to have the SEC launch a new fixed income market structure advisory committee to scrutinize the current rules and identify potential reforms. Clayton said the SEC will also consider a pilot program in coming months to study the impact of the fees and rebates that exchanges charge and provide to brokers.

Trump,JIM LANGEVIN,Jim Mattis,Myron Ebell,Warren Davidson,USA,MILITARY/CLIMATECHANGE,Americas,United States","sector":"Homepage","content":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A coalition of 14 conservative groups urged U.S. lawmakers on Wednesday to support an amendment to the House of Representatives' annual defense bill that would prevent the Pentagon from implementing climate-change and green energy policies meant to save taxpayers money and protect the planet. In a letter to the lawmakers, the groups said many climate programs  are likely to undermine military readiness by diverting scarce resources.  The programs in question were initiated by former President Barack Obama's 2015 executive order requiring the military to meet green energy and greenhouse gas emissions targets. The conservative groups are trying to gather support for Republican Representative Warren Davidson's amendment to the House version of the National Defense Authorization Act that would stop the military from implementing the policies. The groups include the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a libertarian advocacy group; Americans for Prosperity, a group funded by the conservative Koch brothers; and Americans for Limited Government. U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has long been supportive of programs that reduce troops' petroleum dependence. In written testimony to a Senate panel after his confirmation hearing in January, Mattis said  climate change can be a driver of instability  and is  a challenge that requires a broader, whole-of-government response.  The House bill includes language from Democratic Representative Jim Langevin that would require the Pentagon to report to Congress on military bases that are most vulnerable from rising seas and other effects of climate change. It is uncertain whether Davidson's or Langevin's measures would be in the final House bill. The House is due to vote this week on its version of the defense bill and the Senate version will follow later this year. Myron Ebell, the head of global warming and international environmental policy at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, who also led President Donald Trump's transition team for the Environmental Protection Agency, said in an interview that the Defense Department  needs to concentrate on its core mission and not waste a lot of time with irrelevant distractions that gain them some political cover.  When asked about Mattis' position on climate, Ebell said he had heard generals say for years that climate change is a risk and  I've never listened to one who seemed to have the slightest clue as to what he was talking about.  The Defense Department, the largest U.S. consumer of energy, is planning to forge ahead with a decade-long effort to convert operations to green energy.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-military-climatechange-idUSL1N1K32BO"},

The opinions expressed are his own) Size does matter in fund management, and if you are an investor it is not helpful. While the idea that it is harder to perform well managing a larger fund than a smaller one makes intuitive sense, up until now the results from the academic literature have been inconclusive. Most industries experience so-called diseconomies of scale, the point at which producing a given unit of output for a given firm rises. In the case of funds, the issue isn’t so much of the price of managing the money but whether it can be done as successfully, with as much alpha, or market outperformance. After all, size is difficult for fund managers; not only does more money deployed tend to make the market move against you as you try to build a position in a stock, but there are theoretically only so many good investment opportunities and fewer and fewer as your requirements for the size of an investment rise. A new study of U.S. active equity fund managers, borrowing techniques from development economics, purports to show that economies of scale in fund management show diminishing returns. “We find strong evidence for decreasing returns to scale at the individual fund level,” Campbell Harvey of Duke University and Yan Liu of Texas A&M; University write in a study released in late June. (here) “We also present evidence for decreasing returns to scale at the industry level, although its economic significance is much smaller.” This is a finding with wide implications, not only for investors but for the fund management industry. For investors the implication is that they should be more careful, and perhaps parsimonious, in allocating to the largest funds. For fund companies, fighting a difficult battle as they see billions of outflows into passive instruments like ETFs, the realization that there are diseconomies of scale will be deeply unsettling to the largest funds, which benefit from brand recognition and marketing advantages. For an average fund in the study, which covered the years 1991 to 2011, a doubling in size relative to the size of the industry over one year would shave 20 basis points off of their annual alpha. A Business Which Gets Harder and Harder What is true for funds is true for the active fund management industry as a whole, the study finds. “We also find a significant impact of industry size, consistent with earlier research. We estimate that a 1 percent increase in industry size (at the monthly level) implies a 5-basis-point drop in alpha (per annum) for the average fund,” the authors write. The impact of industry size, relative to the size of the market, first improves and then gets worse. This the authors attribute both to the impact of new capital flowing in and the “profitability of investment ideas deteriorating through time.” This, on its face, accords pretty well with Credit Suisse strategist Michael Mauboussin’s “Paradox of Skill”, which posits that the average skill level in the investment industry is rising over time, as poor managers get fired, but that this leaves a tougher set of opponents and less low-hanging investment fruit for those still in the game. Think of a poker game in which the lousy players bust out early in the night. By about midnight, if you are still playing, you are facing a tougher table. Such may be the position of the investment industry, and in some ways, of those most successful at it, whose funds have grown too large to be easy to wield. Mauboussin, building on work by Peter Bernstein from the 1990s, showed in earlier research that statistical measures of outperformance by large capitalization mutual funds in the United States have been declining steadily for almost five decades, with the standard deviation of excess return now less than half what it was in the late 1960s. During the 20 years of the Campbell and Liu study the number of funds increased from about 400 to nearly 1,500 and they moved from owning about 4 percent of market capitalization to nearly 16 percent. Unsurprisingly, the study finds that funds which show themselves less liable to perform more poorly tend to attract a disproportionately large amount of money, perhaps as investors seek to get in on what seems a good thing in a fund with which they are familiar. While these funds are relatively less vulnerable to diseconomies of scale and decreasing alpha, they still are vulnerable, meaning that the additional and large flow of funds only hurts future performance. To be sure, size is surely a good thing for operators of mutual funds. For the rest of us, there is more reason to be skeptical and wary.

Employees of My Street Research, based in Melville, New York, obtained shares at below-market prices from insiders of five public companies, and conducted wash trades and other manipulative trading to drive prices up, according to court papers and acting U.S. Attorney Bridget Rohde in the Eastern District of New York. Victims were repeatedly pressured in cold calls and emails to buy shares and sign up for stock tips, and five defendants tried to launder $14.7 million of proceeds from the scheme, which ran from January 2014 to this month, prosecutors said. One such email, for the company Grilled Cheese Truck Inc , said  URGENT!!!

The opinions expressed are his own) Size does matter in fund management, and if you are an investor it is not helpful. While the idea that it is harder to perform well managing a larger fund than a smaller one makes intuitive sense, up until now the results from the academic literature have been inconclusive. Most industries experience so-called diseconomies of scale, the point at which producing a given unit of output for a given firm rises. In the case of funds, the issue isn’t so much of the price of managing the money but whether it can be done as successfully, with as much alpha, or market outperformance. After all, size is difficult for fund managers; not only does more money deployed tend to make the market move against you as you try to build a position in a stock, but there are theoretically only so many good investment opportunities and fewer and fewer as your requirements for the size of an investment rise. A new study of U.S. active equity fund managers, borrowing techniques from development economics, purports to show that economies of scale in fund management show diminishing returns. “We find strong evidence for decreasing returns to scale at the individual fund level,” Campbell Harvey of Duke University and Yan Liu of Texas A&M; University write in a study released in late June. (here) “We also present evidence for decreasing returns to scale at the industry level, although its economic significance is much smaller.” This is a finding with wide implications, not only for investors but for the fund management industry. For investors the implication is that they should be more careful, and perhaps parsimonious, in allocating to the largest funds. For fund companies, fighting a difficult battle as they see billions of outflows into passive instruments like ETFs, the realization that there are diseconomies of scale will be deeply unsettling to the largest funds, which benefit from brand recognition and marketing advantages. For an average fund in the study, which covered the years 1991 to 2011, a doubling in size relative to the size of the industry over one year would shave 20 basis points off of their annual alpha. A Business Which Gets Harder and Harder What is true for funds is true for the active fund management industry as a whole, the study finds. “We also find a significant impact of industry size, consistent with earlier research. We estimate that a 1 percent increase in industry size (at the monthly level) implies a 5-basis-point drop in alpha (per annum) for the average fund,” the authors write. The impact of industry size, relative to the size of the market, first improves and then gets worse. This the authors attribute both to the impact of new capital flowing in and the “profitability of investment ideas deteriorating through time.” This, on its face, accords pretty well with Credit Suisse strategist Michael Mauboussin’s “Paradox of Skill”, which posits that the average skill level in the investment industry is rising over time, as poor managers get fired, but that this leaves a tougher set of opponents and less low-hanging investment fruit for those still in the game. Think of a poker game in which the lousy players bust out early in the night. By about midnight, if you are still playing, you are facing a tougher table. Such may be the position of the investment industry, and in some ways, of those most successful at it, whose funds have grown too large to be easy to wield. Mauboussin, building on work by Peter Bernstein from the 1990s, showed in earlier research that statistical measures of outperformance by large capitalization mutual funds in the United States have been declining steadily for almost five decades, with the standard deviation of excess return now less than half what it was in the late 1960s. During the 20 years of the Campbell and Liu study the number of funds increased from about 400 to nearly 1,500 and they moved from owning about 4 percent of market capitalization to nearly 16 percent. Unsurprisingly, the study finds that funds which show themselves less liable to perform more poorly tend to attract a disproportionately large amount of money, perhaps as investors seek to get in on what seems a good thing in a fund with which they are familiar. While these funds are relatively less vulnerable to diseconomies of scale and decreasing alpha, they still are vulnerable, meaning that the additional and large flow of funds only hurts future performance. To be sure, size is surely a good thing for operators of mutual funds. For the rest of us, there is more reason to be skeptical and wary.

Men who had the surgery were only slightly more likely to live longer, but they were definitely more likely to be forced to live with the side effects of surgery such as urinary incontinence and erectile or sexual dysfunction. For every 100 men diagnosed with early-stage prostate cancer who underwent surgery, only four fewer died from the disease compared with those who were just kept under observation and treated for symptoms.  For every 100 men with low-risk disease who had a radical prostatectomy, no more than one was saved by surgery, a statistically insignificant difference, the researchers report in the New England Journal of Medicine. Yet 30 to 40 men out of 100 who had surgery experienced erectile dysfunction within five years, 30 developed problems holding their urine within 10 years and 20 to 40 reported dissatisfaction with their ability to perform sexually. The study, known as PIVOT, was designed to shed light on the ongoing controversy over how best to treat prostate cancer, a tumor that is diagnosed in 161,000 men in the U.S. each year but often fails to kill them because the cancer grows so slowly they are more likely to die from some other cause. Thus, many doctors simply recommend some form of watchful waiting.  The cancer kills about 27,000 annually, according to the American Cancer Society. Because men today are being diagnosed earlier, with smaller tumors than they were 20 years ago, any benefits of surgery are probably even smaller than the study suggests, lead author Dr. Timothy Wilt said in written comments to Reuters Health. By the same token,  Men currently diagnosed with prostate cancer will have even better long-term overall and prostate cancer survival with observation than men enrolled in PIVOT,  Wilt said.  The findings  reassure men with low-risk disease who have a life expectancy greater than 10 years that active surveillance is safe and offers better overall quality of life compared to radical treatment,  said Dr. Behfar Ehdaie of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, who was not part of the study. Some men with an intermediate risk may also be able to avoid surgery as well, he told Reuters Health in an email. But Dr. Alexander Kutikov, chief of urologic oncology at the Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia, who also was not connected with the research, said the  quite controversial  study of 731 men, most treated at Veterans Affairs hospitals, was too small to be definitive and 20 percent of the men didn't stick with their assigned treatment, muddying the results. The study also falls short because the men were selected because they were thought to have a life expectancy of 10 years, Kutikov added. Yet at the 10-year mark nearly half had died.  Prostate cancer treatment is an investment at least 10 years into the future,  he said by email.  Men with limited life-expectancy only risk side effects of treatment and don't live long enough to reap its benefits.   A potential harm of observation is that prostate cancer may spread if left untreated and could result in prostate cancer death,  Wilt acknowledged.  Fortunately for most men, this is very unlikely (about 10 percent of men after 20 years) and was not different in men treated with observation or surgery. Systemic progression and prostate cancer death are rare (about 5 percent) in men with low risk disease and are not decreased by surgery.  Only men at intermediate risk showed a benefit from surgery; where survival was 14.5 percentage points higher. That translated to a 20 percent reduction in death from all causes. With 731 men followed for a median of 12.7 years, PIVOT is one of the longest and largest cancer studies ever conducted. In the surgery group, 61.4 percent of the men died from all causes and just 7.4 percent in the surgery group died from prostate cancer. In the observation group, 66.8 percent died, 11.4 percent from prostate cancer.

Home Capital had been searching for a new top executive since March after it terminated Martin Reid as CEO, the beginning of a series of events which led investors to withdraw 95 percent of deposits from the lender's high-interest savings accounts. Home Capital shares have lost more than half their value since the start of the year. Bissada will need to rebuild relationships with mortgage and deposit brokers, and he must also navigate the business through regulatory changes, which could make it harder for sub-prime lenders such as Home Capital to do business in Canada. Regulators have turned their focus on risky lending amid fears of housing bubbles in Toronto and Vancouver and are proposing tougher rules on some mortgages. Home Capital plays an important part in Canada's mortgage market because it serves borrowers such as recent immigrants and the self-employed who may not qualify for loans from the country's biggest banks. Bissada, who has 30 years experience in the industry, said he had been in talks about taking the CEO role for  six or seven weeks.   When I heard that they were hiring for a CEO, I put my hand up right away,  he told Reuters.  I looked at the opportunity of a company that I thought had a very strong nucleus and, with some hard work, could be where we want it to be.  Bissada said he would look to utilize his  great relationships  with mortgage and deposit brokers when he takes up the role on Aug. 3.  I have received fantastic support today -- by way of emails, calls, texts -- from the mortgage broker industry, all very supportive that I'm the guy to do this job,  he said.  It will take about a quarter to either have a plan or be in a good position to know when we'll have a plan so that we can have a clear option on what we want to get done,  he said. Home Capital was forced to raise new capital in April after depositors started withdrawing funds from its high-interest savings accounts after the company terminated Reid on March 27. The withdrawals accelerated after April 19, when Canada's biggest securities regulator, the Ontario Securities Commission, accused Home Capital of making misleading statements to investors about its mortgage underwriting business. Last month, Home Capital settled with the commission and accepted responsibility for misleading investors.. Also last month, Home Capital secured an equity injection and a C$2 billion ($1.5 billion) line of credit from Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway. Bissada, 57, is currently chief executive of Kanetix Ltd, a provider of digital services to the insurance market. He was previously chairman of two mortgage lenders, Canadiana Financial Corp and Paradigm Quest Inc. Bissada also said he would take an active role in the company's search for a chief financial officer. Shares of Home Capital closed down 0.2 percent on Wednesday.

The company, based close to the Alps, makes brakes for Formula One cars and motorbikes and sells them in 70 countries. Hundreds of millions of euros pass through its bank accounts each year – and London is the hub for those flows. As Britain prepares to leave the European Union, the company says it may now have to shift the center of its banking operations to Frankfurt. If Brexit happens with little provision for London's financial services, banks, funds and insurers in London will lose their ability to sell many of their services to European companies. Such upheavals will hurt not just London, say bankers and businessmen, but Europe as well. Financial firms say such shifts will mean the cost of banking for European companies will have to rise, though it is not clear yet who will pick up the bill – the banks or their clients.  At the end of the day it will not be a problem for Brembo, but for our bank,  said Matteo Tiraboschi, executive vice president of Brembo, in an interview at the company's headquarters in Bergamo.  We expect to have the same service for the same price.  Brembo's main bank, Citigroup, declined to comment. Interviews with scores of senior executives from big British and international banks, lawyers, academics, rating agencies and lobbyists outline some of the dangers for companies and consumers from potentially losing access to London's markets. The EU needs London's money, says Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England. He calls Britain  Europe's investment banker  and says half of all the debt and equity issued by the EU involves financial institutions in Britain. Rewiring businesses will be expensive, though estimates vary widely. Investment banks that set up new European outposts to retain access to the EU's single market may see their EU costs rise by between 8 and 22 percent, according to one study by Boston Consulting Group. A separate study by JP Morgan estimates that eight big U.S. and European banks face a combined bill of $7.5 billion over the next five years if they have to move capital markets operations out of London as a result of Brexit. Such costs would equate to an average 2 percent of the banks' global annual expenses, JP Morgan said. Banks say most of those extra costs will end up being paid by customers.  If the cost of production goes up, ultimately a lot of our costs will get passed on to the client base,  said Richard Gnodde, chief executive of the European arm of Goldman Sachs.  As soon as you start to fragment pools of liquidity or fragment capital bases, it becomes less efficient, the costs can go up.  UK-based financial firms are trying to shift some of their operations to Europe to ensure they can still work for EU clients, but warn such a rearrangement of the region's financial architecture could threaten economic stability not only in Britain but also in Europe because so much European money flows through London. European countries, particularly France and Germany, don't share these concerns, viewing Brexit as an opportunity to steal large swathes of business away from Britain and build up their own financial centers. Britain alone accounts for 5.4 percent of global stock markets by value, according to Reuters data. Valdis Dombrovskis, the EU financial services chief, said the EU will still account for 15 percent of global stock markets by value without Britain, and that measures were being taken to strengthen its capital markets. But he added:  Fragmentation is preventing our financial services sector from realizing its full potential.  Industry figures have similar concerns. Jean-Louis Laurens, a former senior Rothschild banker and now ambassador for the French asset management lobby, told Reuters:  If London is broken into pieces then it is not going to be as efficient. Both Europe and Britain are going to lose from this.  Money Machine London is currently home to the world's largest number of banks and hosts the largest commercial insurance market. About six trillion euros ($6.8 trillion), or 37 percent, of Europe's financial assets are managed in the UK capital, almost twice the amount of its nearest rival, Paris. And London dominates Europe's 5.2 trillion euro investment banking industry. London's markets insure French nuclear reactors and Greek ships. German carmakers borrow money for expansion. Dutch pensioners invest their savings. Britain has the largest foreign exchange market and the second largest derivatives market in the world, accounting for just under 40 percent of the world's dealings in those markets, while Paris, London's nearest EU rival, handles under 5 percent, according to the Bank for International Settlements. Each year, euro, yen and dollar trades worth about a combined $869 trillion happen in London - more than in all the euro zone countries combined - according to the City of London Corporation. Barclays Chairman John McFarlane told Reuters that a bad trade deal between Britain and the EU risks harming the international economy, and that some banks may decide to abandon some lines of business altogether because they will be too expensive.  Brexit will put a spotlight on the economic attractiveness of activities you are moving,  he said.  Everybody will say, 'If you move, is it worth it financially?'  Bankers say a number of areas are likely to be affected when Britain leaves the EU. The first is Europe's ability to sell sovereign debt. At present, when a country, say Portugal or Greece, needs to sell debt to keep its hospitals or schools running, it will tap the bond markets, arranged by banks primarily in London. London-based firms are currently responsible for trading about 70 percent of sovereign debt in Europe, according to bankers. But some banks are already withdrawing from arranging the bond sales because it is unprofitable. In the first quarter of the year five banks stopped being primary dealers in various European country bonds, Reuters reported in January. The chief executive of one of Britain's largest banks and one of the largest underwriters of European sovereign debt told Reuters the European Central Bank called him asking him not to abandon selling European debt because of Brexit.  They (EU countries) cannot be shut out from London's capital markets,  he said.  It's suicide.  The ECB declined to comment. A second area that may suffer is the selling of derivatives for companies to buy protection against swings in the U.S. dollar or spikes in the price of oil. Bankers say rivals to London will offer a smaller array of products and at a higher cost because there will be fewer banks offering these services.

EU policymakers want such clearing, which ensures the safe completion of a trade, to be shifted to the euro zone after Brexit. Financiers say that would bump up trading costs for continental customers that deal in a variety of currencies because they will have to route trades through multiple clearing houses, requiring them to post more collateral to back those trades. The Futures Industry Association, a global derivatives industry body, says forcing a shift in euro clearing would increase the amount of cash needed to back trades by about $80 billion. German clearing house Eurex, which stands to gain from a shift, said the increase would be a far more modest $3 billion to $9 billion. The global head of foreign exchange markets at one of the world's largest banks said if the amount of cash required to back trades went up as much as $80 billion – nearly a doubling of the current amount - then  it's going to stop the market.  While bankers say it is hard to estimate how much extra it will cost a European company to borrow without direct access to London's markets, the Association for Financial Markets in Europe said in a report early this month that European customers are being overly optimistic if they think lenders will pick up the bill. The report said for companies similar in size to Brembo  any increase in the cost of debt funding and derivatives would therefore have a material impact on the business, making it less competitive.  Brembo's Tiraboschi disagreed.  As far as Brembo is concerned, we do not have indications for a growth in financing costs linked to Brexit,  he said. Reality Check Last autumn, the British government set about persuading Europe of the risks the EU faces if London's position as a financial center is damaged. A research paper by Ernst & Young surveying major corporates, including Volkswagen and Airbus, found that companies across Europe were worried about the cost of funding rising. The paper, which was commissioned by the City of London Corporation, a municipal body that runs the financial district, was sent to policymakers across the EU. The British government predicted that European companies would tell their respective governments they face higher costs and potential disruption, putting pressure on politicians to take this into account during Brexit negotiations. Slideshow (11 Images)In a speech in late June, British finance minister Philip Hammond said Europe will only hurt its own economy if it undermines London's status as a global finance hub.  Fragmentation of financial services would result in poorer quality, higher priced products for everyone concerned,  he said. But Jeremy Browne, the City of London Corporation's special envoy for Europe, who has visited 26 EU countries over the past year, said many companies and politicians are willing to accept higher prices in return for sticking to EU principles and not giving London any special exemptions.  They are not getting down on one knee begging their governments to be nice to Britain,  Browne said. The UK Treasury declined to comment. With formal divorce talks now triggered, the EU is wasting no time in regrouping to try to replicate Britain's financial services on euro zone soil, egged on by the powerful European Central Bank (ECB). In 2015, the EU launched a  capital markets union  project to improve the way companies can raise funds from stocks, bonds and other securities. That project is now being given more priority, the European Commission said in early June. The ECB says that a  new equilibrium  may be beneficial in the long term to euro zone banks looking to take advantage of business opportunities created by Brexit – while an increase in financing costs is likely to be only  modest  in the near term. Christian Noyer, a former central bank governor of France, is now wooing financial firms to relocate to France. He told Reuters that if European banks had time to adapt  they will do exactly the same job  as London does now.  I don't believe for a minute it will be detrimental,  he said. At least eight European cities are vying for financial firms to set up entities in Europe, hoping to attract their highly-paid employees. The French government has been the most aggressive, dangling the promise of tax breaks and flexible labor laws to complement the French capital's cultural charms. The chief financial officer at one of Europe's biggest banks said he sat through a recent presentation by French officials highlighting the restaurants and nightlife in Paris.  It was all very Moulin Rouge,  he said. A senior German lobbying official, who recently held meetings with the German government, said there is a feeling that Britain is failing to understand that the European project comes first.  British politicians think they are in a position whereby the EU 27 will say, 'OK, there are lots of problems for the EU so we will agree on a trade deal as otherwise the EU will be faced with turmoil as well.' They just don't get it,  he said. Infighting Bankers are skeptical about Europe's efforts to replicate London. They say continental Europe is too leery of Anglo-Saxon free-market capitalism - which many politicians and economists blamed for the 2008 to 2009 global financial crisis. London's dominance as a financial center has been built up over decades and would be very hard to replicate, especially with any speed, given the global talent pool, the widespread use of the UK legal system and the vast amount of money that is managed through London, say executives. The head of European operations at a large U.S. investment bank said that if Europe ever managed to reform its labor laws, develop its capital markets and attract a global workforce, then it would mark the decline of London as a financial center. But Europe may miss this opportunity, he said, because of infighting between EU countries and no clear plan for where jobs and assets will end up. Discord between the euro zone's three largest countries – Germany, France and Italy - initially stalled the ECB's efforts to come up with a way to force euro clearing out of London and put it under its watch, three sources told Reuters in May. Europe  will end up with a hodgepodge of financial centers,  the U.S. executive said. This is  a humongous risk,  he said.  If Europe becomes so unattractive, we just won't be as big in Europe as we are today. Europe won't win.  Instead, some bankers predict the big gainer could be New York, 3,500 miles away. They say it is the only place that can replicate London's depth of markets and expertise.

Employees of My Street Research, based in Melville, New York, obtained shares at below-market prices from insiders of five public companies, and conducted wash trades and other manipulative trading to drive prices up, according to court papers and acting U.S. Attorney Bridget Rohde in the Eastern District of New York. Victims were repeatedly pressured in cold calls and emails to buy shares and sign up for stock tips, and five defendants tried to launder $14.7 million of proceeds from the scheme, which ran from January 2014 to this month, prosecutors said.

Do you have any rope at home? If so tie a knot and hang yourself or get a gun and blow your head off.    Prosecutors said the defendants Erik Matz, 44, of Mt.

Other defendants include cold callers, people involved with stock research, and insiders or marketers affiliated with Grilled Cheese Truck, CES Synergies Inc, Hydrocarb Energy Corp, Intelligent Content Enterprises Inc and National Waste Management Holdings Inc, prosecutors said.

Lula, who was sentenced to 9-1/2 years in prison, would be barred from office if his guilty verdict is upheld by an appeals court, which is expected to take at least eight months to rule.      Many traders worry that Lula, a leftist who has consistently led voting polls for the 2018 presidential elections, could overturn Temer's efforts to curb public debt growth and implement sweeping structural reforms.      This makes traders hopeful that the government's market-friendly platform may extend beyond 2018,  Renascença brokerage trader Thiago Castro said.  Still, there's a long way to go before we see a ruling by the appeals court.      The Brazilian real gained as much as 1.5 percent to its strongest since May 17, when news of a corruption scandal threatening to derail Temer's agenda drove the currency sharply lower.     The benchmark Bovespa stock index rose to a session high, supported by a rally in shares of state-controlled oil company Petróleo Brasileiro SA.     Brazilian markets traded higher throughout the day after an overhaul of the country's labor laws won Senate approval by a wider margin than expected, suggesting lawmaker support for Temer's reform agenda remained strong despite the corruption scandal.     Many investors see the overhaul, part of a package of structural reforms that also includes measures to streamline the country's bloated pension system, as crucial to Brazil's long-term growth.       Other Latin American markets advanced after Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen indicated that the U.S. central bank may raise interest rates less than traders had expected.     Yellen said in testimony to the U.S. Congress that rates  would not have to rise all that much further  to reach what the Fed considers a neutral rate. A slower pace of hikes and lower rates would increase the allure of high-yielding emerging market assets.     The Mexican peso surged to a more than one-year high, bolstered by growing confidence that U.S. President Donald Trump will not pull out of NAFTA, as well as a major oil discovery.     Expectations that Trump will not shred the North American Free Trade Agreement have fed demand for the Mexican peso and helped make it the top-performing emerging-markets currency this year, with a 17 percent gain. On Wednesday it was 3 percent stronger than just before Trump won the election.

The attractiveness of Brazil's corn to growers is amplified by government auctions guaranteeing a premium to market prices, depressed because of ample supplies. The nation will export 28 million tonnes this season, says the government, while the cereals exporter association Anec projects 30 million tonnes, practically the same as two seasons ago, when the country registered record sales abroad.  Brazil's corn is already more competitive than U.S. corn,  said Enilson Nogueira, an analyst at consultancy Céleres.  As winter corn harvesting advances in key states like Mato Grosso, he predicted, Brazil will export between 4 million and 5 million tonnes per month between July and February.   Exports are the only exit to reduce excess domestic supplies,  he said. Government corn auctions, which so far this year pushed growers to sell about 4.5 million tonnes on the market, are also increasing the amount available for export, said Anec. Still, carryover stocks this season are expected to reach a historic high, INTL FCStone analyst Ana Luiza Lodi said. Forecasting exports of 28 million tonnes, she said any serious problems with U.S. corn could benefit Brazil's exporters.  According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Brazil has replaced leading Northern Hemisphere exporters in the global corn market, from September to January, with its winter corn crop. A USDA study also found that Brazil's corn export growth averaged 21 percent annually over a decade through the 2014/15 season. Storage     The bumper crop is leading farmers in the mid-north of Mato Grosso to leave some corn in open fields after harvesting. The temporary arrangement is viable because July is a dry month, said growers association Aprosoja. But this year, the storage issue worsened as producers hoarded soybeans amid low prices. At this point, proceeds from corn sales will be used by farmers rotating crops to pay bills and finance the next soy crop, Anec said.  Mato Grosso's corn production grew by 680 percent in 12 years, according to Aprosoja. Favorable weather and productivity gains led the government to forecast total corn production of 96 million tonnes, a 44 percent increase from the previous cycle and an all-time record.

Deputy Editor in Chief Matt Murray will be promoted to executive editor, and editors for digital content strategy and strategic initiatives will be added, the Journal said in internal memo to employees reviewed by Reuters. It is also streamlining its editing process, building a newsroom focused on mobile content and promoting diversity. The total newsroom headcount will remain  roughly stable,  it added. The reorganization is part of the paper's WSJ 2020 initiative announced in October by Dow Jones & Co, the News Corp (NWSA.O) subsidiary that also owns The Wall Street Journal. The Journal, which News Corp Executive Chairman Rupert Murdoch bought in 2007, offered all news employees a buyout as part of the plan. In Wednesday's memo, Journal Editor in Chief Gerard Baker emphasized the need for more diversity in the newsroom.  If we are to thrive in the competitive environment newspapers face, we must ensure that we are hiring and promoting the best people,  the memo stated. In February, Rebecca Blumenstein resigned as deputy editor in chief to join the New York Times as deputy managing editor. Reporters and editors at the Journal signed a letter to Baker and Murray in March voicing concerns about the lack of gender and racial diversity among the staff, according to the letter reviewed by Reuters.  In November, the Journal folded the Greater New York section into another section of the print newspaper and merged other sections like Business & Tech and Money & Investing.

Enbridge Inc has taken a natural gas compressor station offline but it said on Wednesday that there had been no significant reduction in volumes shipped.  The fires have disrupted timber and mining operations, damaged a regional electric utility and forced more than 14,000 people from their homes in the interior of the province. On Friday, British Columbia declared its first state of emergency since 2003. Enbridge did not specify which pipeline system the station was on, saying only that it was in the affected area, a region ranging from 150 km (95 miles) to 350 km northeast of Vancouver where more than 200 fires were burning. Kinder Morgan Canada Ltd, a unit of Kinder Morgan Inc, removed vegetation along its Trans Mountain pipeline, created a fire break and added sprinklers to keep the area wet, Chief Operating Officer Hugh Harden said in a statement.  The company said the fires were about 16 km away from a pump station in Blackpool, British Columbia.

West Fraser Timber Co and privately held Tolko, among the largest Canadian producers of forestry products, and Norbord Inc, the world's largest maker of oriented strand board, a plywood-like material used in house building, have suspended operations.   Disruptions are expected to tighten the supply of wood products and raise prices.

Tillerson returned to Kuwait, the mediator between the feuding Gulf countries, without making any statement on his talks in the Saudi Red Sea city of Jeddah. He had signed a U.S.-Qatari accord on terrorism financing on Wednesday, but Qatar's opponents said it fell short of allaying their concerns. Any resolution of the impasse must address all the key issues for Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt, a senior UAE official said before the talks in Saudi Arabia. The four countries imposed sanctions on Qatar on June 5, accusing it of financing extremist groups and allying with the Gulf Arab states' arch-foe, Iran. Doha denies those accusations. The four states and Qatar are all U.S. allies. Tillerson met the foreign ministers to try to end the worst dispute in decades among the U.S.-allied Gulf Arab states. He also met separately with Saudi King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to discuss cooperation in combating terrorism and its financing.  We're happy to see this continuous cooperation between us and (to) even strengthen it and increase it further without limits ...  Mohammed bin Salman said in welcoming Tillerson. U.S. officials said Tillerson would travel to Qatar on Thursday to brief the emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, on his talks in Jeddah, State Department spokesman R.C. Hammond said. UAE Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed al-Nahayan told reporters during a visit to Slovakia that Tillerson's visit was unlikely to resolve the row.  I think it will ease tensions, but it's just postponing the problem, which will grow in the future.  In a joint statement issued after Tillerson and his Qatari counterpart signed their counter-terrorism pact on Tuesday, the four states called the accord inadequate. They also reinstated 13 wide-ranging demands they had earlier submitted to Qatar, the world's biggest producer of liquefied natural gas, as a condition for removing sanctions. The demands include curbing Qatar's relations with Iran, closing the Doha-based Al Jazeera TV channel, shutting a Turkish military base in Qatar and handing over all designated  terrorists  on its territory. Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir welcomes U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia July 12, 2017. Saudi Press Agency/Handout via REUTERSAnwar Gargash, the UAE minister of state for foreign affairs, sent a formal complaint to the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights on Wednesday alleging that Al Jazeera supported terrorism, sectarianism and anti-Semitism. Al Jazeera, which has denied allegations of stoking violence and says it practices free speech, did not immediately respond to a request for a comment. Saudi state news agency said Turkish Defence Minister Fikri Isik, whose country backs Qatar in the dispute, discussed bilateral defense ties with his Saudi counterpart, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, in a telephone call on Wednesday. Not Just Funding of Terrorism Slideshow (8 Images)The crisis transcends the financing of terrorism, said Jean-Marc Rickli, a risk analyst at the Geneva Centre for Security Policy, pointing to Gulf fears about the role of Iran, internal instability and the regional influence of the Muslim Brotherhood as well as competition for regional leadership.  Whatever the outcome is, one of the two sides will lose face, and losing face in the Arab world is something important. The consequences for the future will be negative for at least one camp or the other,  Rickli said. France said its foreign minister would visit the Gulf, including Qatar and Saudi Arabia, on July 15-16 as part of its own efforts to overcome the rift. In their statement on Tuesday, the four boycotting states said they appreciated U.S. efforts in fighting terrorism.  ... (But) such a step is not enough and they will closely monitor the seriousness of Qatar in combating all forms of funding, supporting and fostering of terrorism,  the statement said, according to the UAE state news agency WAM.  The United States worries the crisis could affect its military and counter-terrorism operations and increase the regional influence of Iran, which has been supporting Qatar by allowing it to use air and sea links through its territory.

Tillerson returned to Kuwait, the mediator between the feuding Gulf countries, without making any statement on his talks in the Saudi Red Sea city of Jeddah. He had signed a U.S.-Qatari accord on terrorism financing on Wednesday, but Qatar's opponents said it fell short of allaying their concerns. Any resolution of the impasse must address all the key issues for Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt, a senior UAE official said before the talks in Saudi Arabia. The four countries imposed sanctions on Qatar on June 5, accusing it of financing extremist groups and allying with the Gulf Arab states' arch-foe, Iran. Doha denies those accusations. The four states and Qatar are all U.S. allies. Tillerson met the foreign ministers to try to end the worst dispute in decades among the U.S.-allied Gulf Arab states. He also met separately with Saudi King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to discuss cooperation in combating terrorism and its financing.  We're happy to see this continuous cooperation between us and (to) even strengthen it and increase it further without limits ...  Mohammed bin Salman said in welcoming Tillerson. U.S. officials said Tillerson would travel to Qatar on Thursday to brief the emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, on his talks in Jeddah, State Department spokesman R.C. Hammond said. UAE Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed al-Nahayan told reporters during a visit to Slovakia that Tillerson's visit was unlikely to resolve the row.  I think it will ease tensions, but it's just postponing the problem, which will grow in the future.  In a joint statement issued after Tillerson and his Qatari counterpart signed their counter-terrorism pact on Tuesday, the four states called the accord inadequate. They also reinstated 13 wide-ranging demands they had earlier submitted to Qatar, the world's biggest producer of liquefied natural gas, as a condition for removing sanctions. The demands include curbing Qatar's relations with Iran, closing the Doha-based Al Jazeera TV channel, shutting a Turkish military base in Qatar and handing over all designated  terrorists  on its territory. Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir welcomes U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia July 12, 2017. Saudi Press Agency/Handout via REUTERSAnwar Gargash, the UAE minister of state for foreign affairs, sent a formal complaint to the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights on Wednesday alleging that Al Jazeera supported terrorism, sectarianism and anti-Semitism. Al Jazeera, which has denied allegations of stoking violence and says it practices free speech, did not immediately respond to a request for a comment. Saudi state news agency said Turkish Defence Minister Fikri Isik, whose country backs Qatar in the dispute, discussed bilateral defense ties with his Saudi counterpart, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, in a telephone call on Wednesday. Not Just Funding of Terrorism Slideshow (8 Images)The crisis transcends the financing of terrorism, said Jean-Marc Rickli, a risk analyst at the Geneva Centre for Security Policy, pointing to Gulf fears about the role of Iran, internal instability and the regional influence of the Muslim Brotherhood as well as competition for regional leadership.  Whatever the outcome is, one of the two sides will lose face, and losing face in the Arab world is something important. The consequences for the future will be negative for at least one camp or the other,  Rickli said. France said its foreign minister would visit the Gulf, including Qatar and Saudi Arabia, on July 15-16 as part of its own efforts to overcome the rift. In their statement on Tuesday, the four boycotting states said they appreciated U.S. efforts in fighting terrorism.  ... (But) such a step is not enough and they will closely monitor the seriousness of Qatar in combating all forms of funding, supporting and fostering of terrorism,  the statement said, according to the UAE state news agency WAM.  The United States worries the crisis could affect its military and counter-terrorism operations and increase the regional influence of Iran, which has been supporting Qatar by allowing it to use air and sea links through its territory. Qatar hosts Udeid Air Base, the largest U.S. military facility in the Middle East, from which U.S.-led coalition aircraft stage sorties against Islamic State in Syria and Iraq.

EgyptAir earlier on Wednesday announced the lifting of the restrictions on its Cairo-to-New York flights in a Twitter post, but noted that they remain in effect for flights to London.         Saudi Arabian Airlines, also known as Saudia, said in a statement that it expected the ban to be lifted on flights from Jeddah and Riyadh by July 19. Royal Air Maroc believes it could get off the ban for flights out of Casablanca's Mohammed V International Airport by July 19, a senior official of the airline said in a statement. A Homeland Security spokesman, David Lapan, said the July 19 date is a  realistic  timetable for a decision on the two airlines. The measures were imposed in March on nine airlines, most of which were Middle Eastern carriers, to address the potential threat of hidden explosives in laptops and other devices. The restrictions put an additional burden on airlines already hurting from the Trump administration's travel ban on six majority-Muslim countries. On June 28, U.S. Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly unveiled enhanced security measures for all foreign flights arriving in the United States, which officials said were designed to end a limited in-cabin ban on laptops and prevent the ban's expansion to additional airports. European and U.S. officials told Reuters that airlines had 21 days from June 28 to put in place increased explosive trace detection screening and 120 days to comply with other security measures, including enhanced screening of airline passengers.

In the mostly rural, heavily Baptist and predominately Trump-supporting terrain, the collective reaction ranges from   ignorance about the Russia investigation, to a belief that some media want to destroy Republican President Donald Trump and his  family, to complete disinterest.  Many of the 20 people interviewed in several Ohio towns were dismissive of the barrage of headlines about a June 2016 meeting between Trump's eldest son Donald Jr. and a woman he was told was a Russian government lawyer who might have damaging information about Democratic election rival Hillary Clinton. The revelation was made when Trump Jr. released a series of emails on Tuesday amid investigations of U.S. intelligence agency conclusions that Moscow sought to help Trump win. Russia has denied allegations of interfering in the election and Trump has denied his campaign colluded with Russian officials, sometimes dismissing the notion as  fake news.  In Little Hocking, Ohio, Lisa Walker, 54, runs a small thrift shop. Wearing a t-shirt emblazoned with the American flag, she says her husband has expressed fears that somebody is going to try and assassinate Trump. She and her husband voted for Trump. She has followed the revelations about the younger Trump on the news. She sees the Russia investigation as proof that  people are out to get Trump. I would hope they have better things to do than play games and attack Trump.  Similarly, in Jackson and Piketon, Ohio, Donald Trump Jr.'s troubles appeared to strengthen support for his father and Trump family members who many in the area see as embattled victims. In Hillsboro, the county seat of Highland County, the editor of the Hillsboro Times Gazette, Gary Abernathy, says many people in the county believe the media is trying to destroy Trump. FILE PHOTO: Donald Trump Jr. thrusts his fist after speaking at the 2016 Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Ohio U.S. July 19, 2016.Brian Snyder/File photo It just plays into the belief here that the media is fixated on all things Russia,  said Abernathy, whose newspaper was one of only six in the United States to have endorsed Trump for president during the election campaign.  I don't mind Donald Trump being treated critically or aggressively, but not in a way that is an effort to drag him down.

Donald Jr.'s meeting stirred more questions and reporting about possible collusion or whether any U.S. laws were broken. Under the U.S. Federal Election Campaign Act, it is illegal for a foreign national to contribute to a U.S. political campaign. Before the latest disclosures, Americans overall were  sharply divided on what to make of reports about Trump and Russia. According to a Reuters/Ipsos poll in June, 50 percent agreed  that President Trump or someone from his campaign worked with Russia to influence the 2016 election  while 33 percent disagreed and the remainder were unsure. Republicans, however, mostly expressed the opposite view: 66 percent said they disagreed that Trump or his campaign worked with Russia while 20 percent agreed and the rest were unsure.

Connecticut, Wisconsin and Rhode Island's legislatures have not yet passed a budget, while Massachusetts' budget awaits action from state Governor Charlie Baker to either sign or veto it. Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf allowed a state spending plan to become law at midnight Monday by not acting on the plan for 10 days. However, lawmakers are still wrestling with filling an approximately $2 billion deficit.  Connecticut Connecticut Governor Dannel Malloy took control of state spending on June 30. Lawmakers failed to pass a budget before a July 1 deadline due to discord over how to close a $5.1 billion shortfall over the next two years. State offices are open, but funding to nonprofit social service agencies is reduced. Massachusetts Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker has until July 17 to act on a budget passed by the state's legislature July 7. The budget will immediately go into effect if the governor does not take action, said Erica MacKellar, a senior policy analyst with the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL). Lawmakers previously passed a $5.15 billion interim stopgap budget to keep the government open. Rhode Island Turmoil hit Rhode Island's budget process at the last minute on June 30 when its Democratic-controlled Senate amended a $9.2 billion budget already passed by the Democratic-led House of Representatives. House members refused to come back and square up the revised plan, meaning the state still has no budget. The House is still in recess. Services are not affected because Rhode Island, by law, continues to operate under the previous budget. Wisconsin Wisconsin government's primary disagreement centers on transportation funding, said John Hicks, NASBO's executive director. Late budgets are not especially uncommon for Wisconsin, according to Katie Quinn, an NCSL research analyst. Pennsylvania Pennsylvania lawmakers passed a $32 billion state spending plan June 30 but no revenue package was agreed. Lawmakers are still debating how to close a $2 billion budget gap.

We are looking at doing some creative things in terms of creating an economy class,  Moorman said at the National Press Club talk in Washington. He said that seat pitch - the distance between the seatback and the seat in front of it - would be tighter like in airline seats.  There will be some other things that just don't make it quite as comfortable,  Moorman said. Moorman told reporters the railroad is studying the idea and has not made any final decisions. Amtrak fares can be higher than airline fares but its trains currently offer much more leg room than an economy-class airplane seat.  We compete very well with the airlines,  Moorman said, noting trains on its heavily traveled New York-Washington route do not have middle seats and allow passengers to avoid New York's LaGuardia Airport and lengthy airport security lines. Amtrak had a record 31.3 million passengers last year, with more than one-third of them in the Northeast Corridor. It operates an average of 300 trains a year on 21,300 miles of tracks, serving 500 destinations in 46 states. Amtrak struggles to pay for itself. For the year ending Sept. 30, it posted its highest ever total revenue of $3.2 billion. Its unaudited operating loss of $227 million was the smallest since 1973. Amtrak scored a victory on Monday when a U.S. House Appropriations Committee panel rejected massive budget cuts proposed by the Trump administration that would have ended $630 million in subsidies for Amtrak to operate long-distance train service. The House panel instead approved $1.4 billion for Amtrak, about what it received last year. It also backed an additional $900 million in new funding for the $24 billion planned Gateway rail project to build a new train tunnel under the Hudson River near New York City. The funding also will pay to repair the existing, century-old tunnel between New York and New Jersey before it becomes unusable in the next decade. On Wednesday Richard Anderson, a former Delta Air Lines chief, became president and co-CEO on Wednesday, just two days after Amtrak launched a major renovation of its busiest U.S. hub, New York City's Pennsylvania Station, following years of disruptions and delays along the Northeast Corridor.  Anderson and Moorman, who became CEO in September and recruited Anderson, will share the top job until Moorman steps down on Dec. 31. The Penn Station repairs, expected to cost $30 million to $40 million over several years, was expedited after recent derailments and other problems from decaying infrastructure caused delays for thousands of commuters throughout the greater New York City area. It is expected to cause major service disruptions across the metropolitan region this summer. The project has caused a rift between Amtrak, the station owner, and the two states that use most of the hub's track space, New York and New Jersey. Moorman said he is confident the repairs will be completed by early September, or it will finish them on weekends.

The former chairman, Steven Richardson, told jurors in federal court in Brooklyn that he met with Shkreli in September 2014 to tell him he was losing the board's support. Richardson said he had recently learned that Shkreli, himself a board member, had set up a system to pay Retrophin employees commissions to encourage them to trade stocks, against the board's instructions. When Richardson asked Shkreli about that at the meeting, Shkreli denied it.  I was stunned,  Richardson said.  He's lying to my face.  Richardson said he and other board members had already discussed moving Shkreli to another role at the company, which Shkreli founded in 2011, because  he didn't really have the experience or the leadership to run a complex, multi-product business.  Richardson also said the board had concerns about Shkreli's use of Twitter. Shkreli's fellow board members told him he was being removed as CEO on Sept. 29, 2014, though they asked him to stay on as a board member and senior adviser, Richardson said. Richardson said Shkreli refused and boasted that he would found another company that would be worth a billion dollars before Retrophin was. Shkreli did indeed go on to start another company, Turing Pharmaceuticals, which made headlines by acquiring a lifesaving anti-infection drug and jacking up its price by 5,000 percent in 2015. While the move made Shkreli famous as the  pharma bro,  it has nothing to do with the charges against him. Prosecutors, instead, claim that beginning in 2009, Shkreli hid losses from investors in two hedge funds he ran, MSMB Capital and MSMB Healthcare, and paid them back with money stolen from Retrophin, often through sham settlement agreements. Richardson testified that the board was never given those agreements to approve and review. Under cross-examination by Marc Agnifilo, one of Shkreli's lawyers, Richardson conceded that he did know about the settlements by late 2013, and that they were eventually disclosed publicly. He also acknowledged that the board did not cite the settlements as a reason for removing Shkreli as CEO. Richardson testified he invested $400,000 in MSMB, later rolled over into Retrophin. Like other investors, he said he came out ahead, with his investment now worth about $1.9 million.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-crime-shkreli-idUSL1N1K31TD"},

The $4.2 billion Rover project from Pennsylvania to Ontario is the biggest gas pipeline under construction in the United States. ETP has long said it expects the first phase of Rover to enter service in late July with the second phase by Nov. 1. Several energy analysts, however, have said an order by the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) on May 10 banning ETP from new horizontal directional drilling under waterways and roads after a spill in Ohio could cause delays.  ETP spilled about two million gallons of drilling fluid, a clay and water mix, into Tuscarawas River wetlands in Ohio in April.  FERC said in a letter it will continue to ban ETP from new horizontal drilling until it gains  at least a preliminary understanding of the underlying causes for the presence of petroleum hydrocarbons  in the fluid that spilled into the Tuscarawas wetlands. FERC said it did not approve the use of hydrocarbons in the drilling fluid for Rover.  I am concerned that the lack of availability of Rover's personnel and its contractors' personnel is delaying our ability to determine the relevant facts,  Terry Turpin, director of FERC's Office of Energy Projects said in the letter. FERC also said a third party contractor helping the commission put together a plan to prevent further inadvertent releases was still working on that plan. In addition, FERC wants ETP to develop a remediation plan for the Tuscarawas River wetland and remove and dispose of drilling fluids to a site approved of by Ohio's environmental regulators, among other things. Earlier this week, the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency asked the state's attorney general to pursue civil penalties against ETP for environmental violations during the Rover construction. Once it enters service, the pipeline will move up to 3.25 billion cubic feet per day of gas from the Marcellus and Utica shale fields in Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia to customers in Ohio, Michigan, Ontario and elsewhere. One bcf of gas is enough to power about 5 million U.S. homes. Analysts expect several energy companies to increase gas production once Rover enters service to fill the pipe, including Antero Resources Corp, Eclipse Resources Corp, EQT Corp, Gulfport Energy Corp, Rice Energy Inc, Range Resources Corp and Southwestern Energy Co.

Before the Swiss enjoyed a majestic 6-4 6-2 7-6(4) defeat of Canada's Milos Raonic on Center Court, defending champion Andy Murray hobbled to a five-set defeat by American Sam Querrey -- his nagging hip injury finally getting the better of him. Later Novak Djokovic, the man who beat Federer in the 2014 and 2015 finals and was his prospective semi-final opponent this year, quit with an elbow injury against Czech Tomas Berdych. Federer, who skipped the French Open this year to give his body time to recover from his incredible exploits in the first half of the season which he began by winning an 18th major at the Australian Open, said he hoped Murray would not live to regret battling through the pain barrier.  You wish them well right away as a rival to them and a friend,  Federer, who is now favorite to claim a record eighth Wimbledon title, five years after his last one, said.  You want them to be healthy again. Andy, I hope by playing he didn't make things worse. It's big for him to step out on court and give it a go, even though maybe knowing, like me last year, the chances are slim he was going to defend this title.  I have a lot of respect for him doing that. I just hope that he comes out on the other side now not having to miss much later on. I just hope he can recover quickly and get ready for America really, or Canada for that matter.  Federer said he had learned to manage his body -- citing last year's French Open when he arrived at Roland Garros struggling with knee and back injuries and decided to pull out of the tournament before it began. It ended a run of 65 consecutive grand slam appearances.  I was doing fitness with my fitness coach and after like 10 minutes, I looked at him and said, I don't know what we're doing in Paris seriously. My knee is swollen. I don't feel ready to go. My back is funny. My knee is not well. What are we doing?  As a team, we just decided that it's best to skip it. So it wasn't should I or shouldn't I? The body didn't really allow me to play, in my opinion. I got a little sad, I must admit, because I felt like it was a great record for me to keep going.  But health is so much more important than trying to hang onto some sort of a record.  Murray and Djokovic have both turned 30 and while these days that no longer signals a downturn, Federer had some sage advice.  Once you hit 30, you've got to look back and think: How much tennis have I played? How much rest did I give my body over the years? How much training have I done? Did I do enough? Did I overdo it or not enough?  he said.  Sometimes maybe the body and the mind do need a rest.  Of his own physical condition there is no doubt, though.  I'm playing very well. I'm rested. I'm fresh. I'm confident too. Then great things do happen.

The 11-point plan is expected to be presented in the coming days to some nine NGOs who regularly deploy rescue boats to international waters just off the Libyan coast. If any group refuses to accept the terms, they risk being barred access to Italian ports, meaning they would have to divert to other countries to disembark any migrants. Among the proposed new rules will be a ban on making phone calls or firing flares that might signal to human traffickers that they could push their migrant boats out to sea. The NGO vessels will also be obliged to let police travel with them to help root out any human traffickers hidden amongst the migrants. In addition, the boats will no longer be allowed to transfer refugees to other ships, but will instead have to bring them to port themselves, limiting their operations. Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, which received a leaked draft of the Italian document, warned that the proposals could have a disastrous impact on the NGO missions.  Attempts to restrict NGO search and rescue operations risk endangering thousands of lives by limiting rescue boats from accessing the perilous waters near Libya,  said Iverna McGowan, a senior director with Amnesty International. Some 85,217 migrants have come to Italy so far this year, according to data released by the interior ministry on Wednesday, up 8.9 percent on the same period in 2016. Encouraging Sea Crossings?  In all, more than 600,000 newcomers, the majority from sub-Sahara Africa, have reached Italy over the past four years, with tens of thousands more expected in the coming months. A small flotilla of charity boats have become increasingly important in rescue operations, picking up more than a third of all migrants brought ashore so far this year against less than one percent in 2014, according to the Italian coastguard. Rome suspects their presence just outside Libyan territorial waters encourages migrants to risk their lives and put to sea. NGOs deny this and say thousands more would die if their boats were not present in the southern Mediterranean. More than 13,000 people are estimated to have drowned since 2014 trying to make the dangerous crossing to Italy.  The code of conduct will include a categorical ban on NGOs entering Libyan waters unless human life is clearly in danger. While viewing the NGOs with increasing suspicion, the Italian government has also grown frustrated with its EU allies, saying they are not doing enough to help it tackle the crisis, including by taking in many more of the new arrivals. Looking to improve cooperation, Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni met French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Wednesday. However, there was no sign of any pledges to help relieve the pressure on Italy.  Progress has been made regarding migration policy, but it is not yet sufficient,  Gentiloni told reporters.

We are looking at doing some creative things in terms of creating an economy class,  Moorman said at the National Press Club talk in Washington. He said that seat pitch - the distance between the seatback and the seat in front of it - would be tighter like in airline seats.  There will be some other things that just don't make it quite as comfortable,  Moorman said. Moorman told reporters the railroad is studying the idea and has not made any final decisions. Amtrak fares can be higher than airline fares but its trains currently offer much more leg room than an economy-class airplane seat.  We compete very well with the airlines,  Moorman said, noting trains on its heavily traveled New York-Washington route do not have middle seats and allow passengers to avoid New York's LaGuardia Airport and lengthy airport security lines. Amtrak had a record 31.3 million passengers last year, with more than one-third of them in the Northeast Corridor. It operates an average of 300 trains a year on 21,300 miles of tracks, serving 500 destinations in 46 states. Amtrak struggles to pay for itself. For the year ending Sept. 30, it posted its highest ever total revenue of $3.2 billion. Its unaudited operating loss of $227 million was the smallest since 1973. Amtrak scored a victory on Monday when a U.S. House Appropriations Committee panel rejected massive budget cuts proposed by the Trump administration that would have ended $630 million in subsidies for Amtrak to operate long-distance train service. The House panel instead approved $1.4 billion for Amtrak, about what it received last year. It also backed an additional $900 million in new funding for the $24 billion planned Gateway rail project to build a new train tunnel under the Hudson River near New York City. The funding also will pay to repair the existing, century-old tunnel between New York and New Jersey before it becomes unusable in the next decade. On Wednesday Richard Anderson, a former Delta Air Lines chief, became president and co-CEO on Wednesday, just two days after Amtrak launched a major renovation of its busiest U.S. hub, New York City's Pennsylvania Station, following years of disruptions and delays along the Northeast Corridor.  Anderson and Moorman, who became CEO in September and recruited Anderson, will share the top job until Moorman steps down on Dec. 31. The Penn Station repairs, expected to cost $30 million to $40 million over several years, was expedited after recent derailments and other problems from decaying infrastructure caused delays for thousands of commuters throughout the greater New York City area. It is expected to cause major service disruptions across the metropolitan region this summer. The project has caused a rift between Amtrak, the station owner, and the two states that use most of the hub's track space, New York and New Jersey. Moorman said he is confident the repairs will be completed by early September, or it will finish them on weekends.

Hopefully, in the next two to three months we can see how predictable the production return has been and then can say we feel stabilized and need to make the corresponding cuts,  Emmanuel Ibe Kachikwu told reporters. Nigeria and Libya, whose output has been hit by political turmoil and attacks, are exempt from an the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries agreement, which is an effort to reduce a glut of crude oil on world markets. Related CoverageNigerian oil minister will not attend OPEC, non-OPEC meeting in Russia in JulyNigeria's benchmark level to join the OPEC cuts is production of 1.8 million barrels of crude a day. Its current output is around 1.7 million barrels a day, excluding condensates, Kachikwu said. Nigeria's output had improved in recent months, after the government managed to end militant attacks on oil pipelines in the Niger Delta by opening peace talks with leaders in the restive oil hub. Kachikwu also said he would not attend a meeting between OPEC and non-OPEC nations on July 24 in Russia, because he would be hosting a meeting of African oil producers in Abuja on the same day.  We (OPEC) are fairly in consensus on our position on cuts,  he said, adding that OPEC hoped oil prices would stabilize later this month. Under the supply deal, OPEC is curbing output by about 1.2 million barrels a day. Russia and other non-OPEC producers are cutting half as much, until March 2018. OPEC said on Wednesday its oil production jumped in June and forecast world demand for its crude would decline next year as rivals pump more, pointing to a market surplus in 2018 despite the OPEC-led output cut. Giving its first forecasts for 2018 in a monthly report, OPEC said the world will need 32.20 million barrels per day of crude from its members next year, a fall of 60,000 barrels a day from this year.

The 11-point plan is expected to be presented in the coming days to some nine NGOs who regularly deploy rescue boats to international waters just off the Libyan coast. If any group refuses to accept the terms, they risk being barred access to Italian ports, meaning they would have to divert to other countries to disembark any migrants. Among the proposed new rules will be a ban on making phone calls or firing flares that might signal to human traffickers that they could push their migrant boats out to sea. The NGO vessels will also be obliged to let police travel with them to help root out any human traffickers hidden amongst the migrants. In addition, the boats will no longer be allowed to transfer refugees to other ships, but will instead have to bring them to port themselves, limiting their operations. Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, which received a leaked draft of the Italian document, warned that the proposals could have a disastrous impact on the NGO missions.  Attempts to restrict NGO search and rescue operations risk endangering thousands of lives by limiting rescue boats from accessing the perilous waters near Libya,  said Iverna McGowan, a senior director with Amnesty International. Some 85,217 migrants have come to Italy so far this year, according to data released by the interior ministry on Wednesday, up 8.9 percent on the same period in 2016. Encouraging Sea Crossings?  In all, more than 600,000 newcomers, the majority from sub-Sahara Africa, have reached Italy over the past four years, with tens of thousands more expected in the coming months. A small flotilla of charity boats have become increasingly important in rescue operations, picking up more than a third of all migrants brought ashore so far this year against less than one percent in 2014, according to the Italian coastguard. Rome suspects their presence just outside Libyan territorial waters encourages migrants to risk their lives and put to sea. NGOs deny this and say thousands more would die if their boats were not present in the southern Mediterranean. More than 13,000 people are estimated to have drowned since 2014 trying to make the dangerous crossing to Italy.  The code of conduct will include a categorical ban on NGOs entering Libyan waters unless human life is clearly in danger. While viewing the NGOs with increasing suspicion, the Italian government has also grown frustrated with its EU allies, saying they are not doing enough to help it tackle the crisis, including by taking in many more of the new arrivals. Looking to improve cooperation, Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni met French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Wednesday. However, there was no sign of any pledges to help relieve the pressure on Italy.  Progress has been made regarding migration policy, but it is not yet sufficient,  Gentiloni told reporters.

In the mostly rural, heavily Baptist and predominately Trump-supporting terrain, the collective reaction ranges from   ignorance about the Russia investigation, to a belief that some media want to destroy Republican President Donald Trump and his  family, to complete disinterest.  Many of the 20 people interviewed in several Ohio towns were dismissive of the barrage of headlines about a June 2016 meeting between Trump's eldest son Donald Jr. and a woman he was told was a Russian government lawyer who might have damaging information about Democratic election rival Hillary Clinton. The revelation was made when Trump Jr. released a series of emails on Tuesday amid investigations of U.S. intelligence agency conclusions that Moscow sought to help Trump win. Russia has denied allegations of interfering in the election and Trump has denied his campaign colluded with Russian officials, sometimes dismissing the notion as  fake news.  In Little Hocking, Ohio, Lisa Walker, 54, runs a small thrift shop. Wearing a t-shirt emblazoned with the American flag, she says her husband has expressed fears that somebody is going to try and assassinate Trump. She and her husband voted for Trump. She has followed the revelations about the younger Trump on the news. She sees the Russia investigation as proof that  people are out to get Trump. I would hope they have better things to do than play games and attack Trump.  Similarly, in Jackson and Piketon, Ohio, Donald Trump Jr.'s troubles appeared to strengthen support for his father and Trump family members who many in the area see as embattled victims. In Hillsboro, the county seat of Highland County, the editor of the Hillsboro Times Gazette, Gary Abernathy, says many people in the county believe the media is trying to destroy Trump. FILE PHOTO: Donald Trump Jr. thrusts his fist after speaking at the 2016 Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Ohio U.S. July 19, 2016.Brian Snyder/File photo It just plays into the belief here that the media is fixated on all things Russia,  said Abernathy, whose newspaper was one of only six in the United States to have endorsed Trump for president during the election campaign.  I don't mind Donald Trump being treated critically or aggressively, but not in a way that is an effort to drag him down. Donald Trump Jr. had one 20 minute meeting with a lawyer from Russia and it's wall-to-wall coverage.

Donald Jr.'s meeting stirred more questions and reporting about possible collusion or whether any U.S. laws were broken. Under the U.S. Federal Election Campaign Act, it is illegal for a foreign national to contribute to a U.S. political campaign. Before the latest disclosures, Americans overall were  sharply divided on what to make of reports about Trump and Russia. According to a Reuters/Ipsos poll in June, 50 percent agreed  that President Trump or someone from his campaign worked with Russia to influence the 2016 election  while 33 percent disagreed and the remainder were unsure. Republicans, however, mostly expressed the opposite view: 66 percent said they disagreed that Trump or his campaign worked with Russia while 20 percent agreed and the rest were unsure.

Yet the Cuban designer must rummage through trash bins and scour the sidewalks of Havana for scraps of wood and obsolete electrical devices to manufacture them. In Communist-run Cuba, designers of clothes and household goods say the absence of wholesale stores as well as the expense and scarcity of raw materials have forced them to get creative. Many turn to repurposing and recycling the materials at hand. These pioneers of the island's fledgling private sector say they are turning a competitive disadvantage into an asset, while yielding unique, ecologically-friendly designs.  It's not easy to get the materials so we have to adapt and improvise a lot,  said Alejo, 37, whose lamps contain salt crystals.  Some 50-60 percent is recycled material.  Alejo said he asks carpenters for their leftover scraps and uses the frames of discarded windows and doors in order to make the wooden bases for his lamps. He also salvages the switches, plugs and cables from old electrical devices.  They are extremely expensive, and there isn't a regular supply in stores,  he said, adding his company Luzvi still must import some inputs - like lightbulbs with a softer glow than Cuba's starkly white, energy-saving ones. The new lamps sell for between $25 and $50, a relatively hefty sum in a country where the average monthly state salary is around $30. Lower input costs would enable Alejo to cut prices, he said. The government has allowed more Cubans to set up their own businesses in recent years as part of its plan to update its ailing, Soviet-style economy and cut the bloated state payroll. A child tries a school uniform at a recycling store in Havana, Cuba, July 5, 2017.Alexandre MeneghiniThe number of Cuba's self-employed more than tripled in six years to above 500,000 by the end of 2016, official data shows. Some entrepreneurs complain, however, that the government has not followed through on certain reforms. For example, the country's small, private businesses still do not have access to the wholesale market. Raw materials are often in short supply and expensive, although Havana puts that down to the half-century-old U.S. trade blockade. Slideshow (7 Images)Caridad Limonta, whose family firm Procle sells women's apparel and home goods, said new textiles were costly so she mostly bought clothes or hotel curtains and sheets at state-run, second-hand stores and recycled them.  I transform trousers for example into bags,  said the 60-year-old entrepreneur.  The backs of shirts don't damage as much so I cut them, stick them together and make patchwork quilts.  Limonta said Cubans are not in the habit of throwing things away, and find new uses for them instead. At Procle, shoulder pads become sponges for the kitchen, while old curtains are reinvented as tablecloths. While Limonta said she wished it were easier to buy textiles, she also does not want Cuba to adopt the same kind of  fast fashion  prevalent in consumerist economies where clothes are cheap but often disposable, generating trash. In the business district of Vedado, just around the corner from Procle, is the Vintage Bazar, a shop that refurbishes old lamps as well as designs quirky new ones with anything from plumbing pipes to water bottles.  In other countries you would throw away the lamp and buy a new one,  said designer Gretel Serrano, 32, who is currently refurbishing a large batch of lamps for a hotel.  Here people bring them to the shop and we restore them like new.  Reporting by Sarah Marsh, editing by G Crosse","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-cuba-recycling-idUSKBN19X1DA"},

The former chairman, Steven Richardson, told jurors in federal court in Brooklyn that he met with Shkreli in September 2014 to tell him he was losing the board's support. Richardson said he had recently learned that Shkreli, himself a board member, had set up a system to pay Retrophin employees commissions to encourage them to trade stocks, against the board's instructions. When Richardson asked Shkreli about that at the meeting, Shkreli denied it.  I was stunned,  Richardson said.  He's lying to my face.  Richardson said he and other board members had already discussed moving Shkreli to another role at the company, which Shkreli founded in 2011, because  he didn't really have the experience or the leadership to run a complex, multi-product business.  Richardson also said the board had concerns about Shkreli's use of Twitter. Shkreli's fellow board members told him he was being removed as CEO on Sept. 29, 2014, though they asked him to stay on as a board member and senior adviser, Richardson said. Richardson said Shkreli refused and boasted that he would found another company that would be worth a billion dollars before Retrophin was. Shkreli did indeed go on to start another company, Turing Pharmaceuticals, which made headlines by acquiring a lifesaving anti-infection drug and jacking up its price by 5,000 percent in 2015.  While the move made Shkreli famous as the  pharma bro,  it has nothing to do with the charges against him.  Prosecutors, instead, claim that beginning in 2009, Shkreli hid losses from investors in two hedge funds he ran, MSMB Capital and MSMB Healthcare, and paid them back with money stolen from Retrophin, often through sham settlement agreements. Richardson testified that the board was never given those agreements to approve and review. Under cross-examination by Marc Agnifilo, one of Shkreli's lawyers, Richardson conceded that he did know about the settlements by late 2013, and that they were eventually disclosed publicly. He also acknowledged that the board did not cite the settlements as a reason for removing Shkreli as CEO. Richardson testified he invested $400,000 in MSMB, later rolled over into Retrophin. Like other investors, he said he came out ahead, with his investment now worth about $1.9 million.

The $4.2 billion Rover project from Pennsylvania to Ontario is the biggest gas pipeline under construction in the United States. ETP has long said it expects the first phase of Rover to enter service in late July with the second phase by Nov. 1. Several energy analysts, however, have said an order by the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) on May 10 banning ETP from new horizontal directional drilling under waterways and roads after a spill in Ohio could cause delays.  ETP spilled about two million gallons of drilling fluid, a clay and water mix, into Tuscarawas River wetlands in Ohio in April.  FERC said in a letter it will continue to ban ETP from new horizontal drilling until it gains  at least a preliminary understanding of the underlying causes for the presence of petroleum hydrocarbons  in the fluid that spilled into the Tuscarawas wetlands. FERC said it did not approve the use of hydrocarbons in the drilling fluid for Rover.  I am concerned that the lack of availability of Rover's personnel and its contractors' personnel is delaying our ability to determine the relevant facts,  Terry Turpin, director of FERC's Office of Energy Projects said in the letter. FERC also said a third party contractor helping the commission put together a plan to prevent further inadvertent releases was still working on that plan. In addition, FERC wants ETP to develop a remediation plan for the Tuscarawas River wetland and remove and dispose of drilling fluids to a site approved of by Ohio's environmental regulators, among other things. Earlier this week, the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency asked the state's attorney general to pursue civil penalties against ETP for environmental violations during the Rover construction. Once it enters service, the pipeline will move up to 3.25 billion cubic feet per day of gas from the Marcellus and Utica shale fields in Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia to customers in Ohio, Michigan, Ontario and elsewhere. One bcf of gas is enough to power about 5 million U.S. homes. Analysts expect several energy companies to increase gas production once Rover enters service to fill the pipe, including Antero Resources Corp, Eclipse Resources Corp, EQT Corp, Gulfport Energy Corp, Rice Energy Inc, Range Resources Corp and Southwestern Energy Co.

The forced removal of a passenger on April 9 to make room for airline employees trying to fly to Louisville was  completely unacceptable,  Chicago Department of Aviation Commissioner Ginger Evans said in a 12-page report. Other policy changes outlined in the report include the removal of the word  police  from aviation security uniforms and vehicles in coming months.  Their role is to perform security functions, not policing functions,  Evans said in the report. An updated training program for aviation security will also be developed, according to the report.  David Dao, a 69-year-old Vietnamese-American doctor, was injured when Chicago aviation security dragged him from United Flight 3411 at O'Hare International Airport. Dao and United reached a settlement over the matter, terms of which were not disclosed. In May, Evans apologized for the behavior of her department's employees and told a U.S. Senate commerce subcommittee that how Dao's issue was handled was  deeply saddening and personally offensive.  Evans said in the report that Chicago was  doubling efforts to strengthen policies, procedures and training to ensure that something like this never happens again.  The aviation department suspended four employees in the incident, but has not said what disciplinary action they face. A department spokeswoman declined to elaborate. Viral videos of Dao being dragged down the aisle of the United jet sparked a public outcry and calls in Washington for tighter airline industry regulation. United fanned the flames of outrage with the initial public reaction of Chief Executive Officer Oscar Munoz. Some saw his remarks as blaming the passenger. The airline's board of directors reversed an agreement to make Munoz company chairman in 2018.

Yields, which move inversely to prices, dropped to three-week lows for the two-year note, while those on three-to-10-year maturities slid to two-week troughs. In testimony delivered to Congress, Yellen said the Fed would not need to raise rates  all that much further  to reach current low estimates of the neutral fed funds rate. She did say, though, that the U.S. economy was healthy enough to absorb further gradual rate increases and the slow reduction of the Fed's massive bond portfolio. Yellen also expressed concern about the  somewhat low  wage growth given the Fed's 2 percent inflation target.  Yellen's congressional remarks reminded traders that inflation's path higher remains an uncertainty in the Fed's rate policy,  said Jim Vogel, interest rates strategist at FTN Financial in Memphis, Tennessee. In late trading, the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield fell to 2.302 percent, its lowest in two weeks, from 2.362 percent late on Tuesday. It was last at 2.319 percent. At the front-end of the curve, the two-year yield dropped as low as 1.331 percent, a three-week trough, from 1.379 percent late on Tuesday, and last traded at 1.347 percent. Rate futures indicated a 53 percent chance the Fed would raise key overnight borrowing costs at its December policy meeting, down from 60 percent shortly before the release of Yellen's speech, according to CME Group's FedWatch program.  A lot is going to depend on how the market reacts to the Fed's announcement of the change in its reinvestment policy,  said Subadra Rajappa, head of U.S. rates strategy at Societe Generale in New York.  If there is no sort of tantrum after the announcement, then it makes sense to hike rates in December,  she added. The expected pace of hikes in 2018 has declined as well, said TD Securities in a research note, with the market only pricing in one hike between now and the end of 2018. Also on Wednesday, the U.S. Treasury sold $20 billion in 10-year notes with mixed results. The note fetched a yield of 2.325 percent, compared with expectations of around 2.323 percent. Bids totaled nearly $49 billion for a bid-to-cover ratio of 2.45, a little below last month's 2.54 but in line with the 2.43 average. Indirect bids, which include those from foreign central banks, were a solid 64.8 percent.

The former chairman, Steven Richardson, told jurors in federal court in Brooklyn that he met with Shkreli in September 2014 to tell him he was losing the board's support. Richardson said he had recently learned that Shkreli, himself a board member, had set up a system to pay Retrophin employees commissions to encourage them to trade stocks, against the board's instructions. When Richardson asked Shkreli about that at the meeting, Shkreli denied it.  I was stunned,  Richardson said.  He's lying to my face.  Richardson said he and other board members had already discussed moving Shkreli to another role at the company, which Shkreli founded in 2011, because  he didn't really have the experience or the leadership to run a complex, multi-product business.  Richardson also said the board had concerns about Shkreli's use of Twitter. Shkreli's fellow board members told him he was being removed as CEO on Sept. 29, 2014, though they asked him to stay on as a board member and senior adviser, Richardson said. Richardson said Shkreli refused and boasted that he would found another company that would be worth a billion dollars before Retrophin was. Shkreli did indeed go on to start another company, Turing Pharmaceuticals, which made headlines by acquiring a lifesaving anti-infection drug and jacking up its price by 5,000 percent in 2015.  While the move made Shkreli famous as the  pharma bro,  it has nothing to do with the charges against him.  Prosecutors, instead, claim that beginning in 2009, Shkreli hid losses from investors in two hedge funds he ran, MSMB Capital and MSMB Healthcare, and paid them back with money stolen from Retrophin, often through sham settlement agreements. Richardson testified that the board was never given those agreements to approve and review. Under cross-examination by Marc Agnifilo, one of Shkreli's lawyers, Richardson conceded that he did know about the settlements by late 2013, and that they were eventually disclosed publicly. He also acknowledged that the board did not cite the settlements as a reason for removing Shkreli as CEO. Richardson testified he invested $400,000 in MSMB, later rolled over into Retrophin. Like other investors, he said he came out ahead, with his investment now worth about $1.9 million.

With about three dozen members, the Freedom Caucus can stymie any legislation in the Republican-controlled House.  Passing a budget resolution is vital to the success of a  Republican tax overhaul effort because it would allow a bill to pass the 100-seat Senate with only a simple majority.

But the House budget squabble and hurdles facing healthcare legislation in the Senate have begun to worry business lobbyists about the prospects for success.

But concerns that the 25-basis-point rate increase would hit consumer spending, raise borrowing costs and hurt exporters weighed on some pockets of the stock market.  We're moving off generationally low rates,  said Paul Taylor, CIO of fundamental equities at BMO Asset Management Inc.  The Bank of Canada rate decision was a bit of sobering news for the Canadian market.  The rate increase was widely anticipated but the upbeat statement supported the view of more hikes in coming months, even though it said future moves would be guided by economic data given  continued uncertainty and financial system vulnerabilities.   It is a story about the (Canadian) dollar and can our exports compete,  said John Stephenson, president & chief executive at Stephenson & Company Capital Management.  The market is looking out there and asking will it hurt our competitiveness, hurt the (construction) sector in the economy that is hot.  The loonie has soared some 6 percent since the Bank of Canada turned hawkish in June, while yield on the country's 2-year bond has jumped nearly 0.5 percentage point. Data from the overnight index swaps market indicated a greater than 80 percent chance of another rate increase by December. The Canadian dollar notched it biggest percentage gain since March 2016 and was last trading at C$1.2737 to the greenback, or 78.51 U.S. cents, up 1.4 percent. The currency touched C$1.2681, its highest since June 23, 2016, while 2-year yields hit their highest since October 2013 at 1.201 percent. In contrast, U.S. Treasury yields fell after Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen dampened expectations for a U.S. interest rate hike this year and in 2018. Canada's main stock index rallied nearly 1 percent in line with U.S. markets before the rate announcement but later retreated from session highs, also due in part to company news and seesawing crude oil prices. The Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P;/TSX composite index finished down 5.15 points, or 0.03 percent, to 15,143.99, reversing the session's gains. Some retail stocks fell on worries that Canada's highly indebted consumers could feel squeezed by higher interest rates. Canadians owe C$1.67 for every dollar of income, a near-record high. Canada's biggest banks raised their prime lending rates in response to the central bank move. Higher rates are expected to boost banks' profit margins.

The forced removal of a passenger on April 9 to make room for airline employees trying to fly to Louisville was  completely unacceptable,  Chicago Department of Aviation Commissioner Ginger Evans said in a 12-page report. Other policy changes outlined in the report include the removal of the word  police  from aviation security uniforms and vehicles in coming months.  Their role is to perform security functions, not policing functions,  Evans said in the report. An updated training program for aviation security will also be developed, according to the report.  David Dao, a 69-year-old Vietnamese-American doctor, was injured when Chicago aviation security dragged him from United Flight 3411 at O'Hare International Airport. Dao and United reached a settlement over the matter, terms of which were not disclosed. In May, Evans apologized for the behavior of her department's employees and told a U.S. Senate commerce subcommittee that how Dao's issue was handled was  deeply saddening and personally offensive.  Evans said in the report that Chicago was  doubling efforts to strengthen policies, procedures and training to ensure that something like this never happens again.  The aviation department suspended four employees in the incident, but has not said what disciplinary action they face. A department spokeswoman declined to elaborate. Viral videos of Dao being dragged down the aisle of the United jet sparked a public outcry and calls in Washington for tighter airline industry regulation. United fanned the flames of outrage with the initial public reaction of Chief Executive Officer Oscar Munoz. Some saw his remarks as blaming the passenger. The airline's board of directors reversed an agreement to make Munoz company chairman in 2018.

EgyptAir earlier on Wednesday announced the lifting of the restrictions on its Cairo-to-New York flights in a Twitter post, but noted that they remain in effect for flights to London.         Saudi Arabian Airlines, also known as Saudia, said in a statement that it expected the ban to be lifted on flights from Jeddah and Riyadh by July 19. Royal Air Maroc believes it could get off the ban for flights out of Casablanca's Mohammed V International Airport by July 19, a senior official of the airline said in a statement. A Homeland Security spokesman, David Lapan, said the July 19 date is a  realistic  timetable for a decision on the two airlines. The measures were imposed in March on nine airlines, most of which were Middle Eastern carriers, to address the potential threat of hidden explosives in laptops and other devices. The restrictions put an additional burden on airlines already hurting from the Trump administration's travel ban on six majority-Muslim countries. On June 28, U.S. Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly unveiled enhanced security measures for all foreign flights arriving in the United States, which officials said were designed to end a limited in-cabin ban on laptops and prevent the ban's expansion to additional airports. European and U.S. officials told Reuters that airlines had 21 days from June 28 to put in place increased explosive trace detection screening and 120 days to comply with other security measures, including enhanced screening of airline passengers.

The U.S. Federal Trade Commission filed a lawsuit in June aimed at stopping the merger, arguing that the combined company would control more than 90 percent of the U.S. market for paid daily fantasy sports contests. The lawsuit was the latest setback for the two companies, which have faced regulatory challenges in several states. They announced the deal in November 2016 as a merger of equals that would cut their legal bills. The companies said in similar filings that the FTC lawsuit reflected  an unnecessarily rigid and uninformed application of the antitrust laws to an underdeveloped, nascent industry, and largely ignore rigorous economic analysis that has revealed consistently, no matter which way it is analyzed, that prices are not likely to increase as a result of the transaction.   The companies also said their deal would be good for consumers and argued that they competed for players against larger, more powerful companies in the broader and longer- running fantasy sports businesses, like ESPN (DIS.N) and Yahoo (VZ.N).  DraftKings admits that fantasy sports include, but are not limited to, both season-long fantasy sports ( SLFS ) and DFS (daily fantasy sports), but specifically denies the characterization that SLFS and DFS are distinct,  the company said in its filing.  Modern fantasy sports started in 1980 and have mushroomed online. Participants typically create teams that span an entire season in professional sports, including American football, baseball, basketball and hockey. Daily fantasy sports, which focus on single-day contests, have developed over the past decade into a multibillion-dollar industry. The FTC has asked the court for a preliminary injunction to prevent the companies from closing the deal while it proceeds with an internal review to determine if the merger is legal. If the FTC wins a preliminary injunction, companies normally give up because deals cannot be held together during the lengthy internal process. The FTC has won a long list of court fights in recent years. The agency stopped food distribution giant Sysco Corp from buying US Foods Inc and prevented office supplies retailer Staples Inc from acquiring Office Depot Inc.

The reorganization of the company, nearly entirely state-owned, involves the sale of Areva's nuclear reactor business as New Areva NP to power utility EDF (EDF.PA) by the end of this year. Its uranium mining, nuclear fuel production and decommissioning activities will be transferred to a new company, NewCo. Areva and France's finance ministry also said the state would also inject 2.5 billion euros into NewCo by July 31, while Japan's MHI (7011.T) and JNFL would put in capital totaling 500 million euros by the end of the month.  These capital increases, which represent an extraordinary mobilization of resources by the state, is a key component and the last phase in the restructuring of the nuclear group, before exclusive control of New Areva NP is handed over to EDF,  Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said in a statement. The decision in 2015 to reorganize Areva SA came after the company was hit by low demand for nuclear power after the Fukushima disaster in Japan 2011. Le Maire said the past management of Areva had been  scandalous  but the government was regaining confidence in its leadership. After the sale of New Areva NP to EDF and the creation of NewCo, Areva SA will be left with managing the EPR OL3 nuclear power plant construction project in Finland, a project which has been beset by a series of delays and extra costs.

The Czech 11th seed was leading by a set and a break of serve when second seed Djokovic withdrew due to an elbow injury [nL4N1K34ST]. The match ended Berdych's run of 12 straight losses against the Serb during which he won two sets in total. He had not beaten the 12-times grand slam winner since 2013, and had won just twice in 27 matches. But now the 31-year-old is through to his second successive Wimbledon semi-final, where he will go up against seven-times champion Federer. However, he said he was no more daunted by the Swiss master than he was by Djokovic.  No matter if it's Roger or if it's Novak, or a guy in the first round, what's most important is myself, my game, belief in what I'm doing,  he said.  I just need to go out there and play my best.  He did, though, acknowledge the scale of the task he faced.  It's a really exceptional tennis player that we have, that our sport has right now,  he said of third-seeded Federer.   There was nobody better in the past - I think he's the greatest of them all. It's a great challenge to have the opportunity to play him.  Berdych has never won a grand slam, although he was Wimbledon runner-up in 2010 when he lost to Rafael Nadal. He has reached seven grand slam semi-finals - second only to Ivan Lendl among Czech men. But asked if received the kind of recognition at home that he might get if he were from another country, he said:  I'm not aware of any stadium or statue with my name on in the Czech Republic.

The American world number 43, sidelined since early June with a shoulder injury, should be one to watch in a relatively weak field at TPC Deere Run where he has recorded 23 consecutive sub-par rounds. Among the other leading contenders are Charley Hoffman, who has finished in the top 10 in each of his last two events, twice major winner Zach Johnson, who has six top-three finishes here since 2009 including victory in 2012, and Steve Stricker, the only man to win the event in three consecutive years. After earning his fifth PGA Tour win at last year's John Deere Classic, Moore had a red-hot run that included a playoff loss to Rory McIlroy in the season-ending Tour Championship and a spot on the U.S. Ryder Cup team. Now, in his only tune-up ahead of next week's British Open at Royal Birkdale, Moore is confident the shoulder injury that kept him out of this year's U.S. Open will not hold him back.  I probably could have come back couple weeks ago if I really needed to, but I thought this was the right time with the end of the season being a pretty big push here,  Moore, who will tee off with fellow Americans Kyle Stanley and William McGirt in Thursday's opening round, told reporters.  I was fortunate I was in a position where I was in a decent spot in the FedExCup (standings) so I could take a few more weeks and just get the right amount of rest and rehab in.  World number 20 Daniel Berger will be eager to get going as this week marks his first tournament start since Jordan Spieth stole a victory from his fellow American when he holed a bunker shot during a playoff at the Travelers Championship. Johnson has only two top-10 finishes in 16 starts this year but his game is considered an ideal fit for TPC Deere Run.  I have not been putting well. That's really what it boils down to. I've got to make more putts. I know what to do. That darn word of 'patience' certainly is probably paramount,  said Johnson.  That's been my emphasis over the last so many odd weeks is just making some putts and trying to score. My game is fine. Just hasn't surfaced yet.

The 214.5-km trek from Pau to Peyragudes will offer opportunities for the aggressive riders, but a solo effort will be doomed as Briton Froome's Team Sky outfit are experts in containing the opposition.  What we will see is I guess a train from Sky (setting a high pace in the climbs),  LeMond, who is on the Tour as an analyst for Eurosport, said on Wednesday in his daily chat with Reuters.  There will not be a lot of attacks early on. I'm not expecting anything crazy, but sometimes it's when you don't expect things that they happen.  The hardest climbs come in the last 50-km of the stage, with the Port de Bales (11.7km at an average gradient of 7.7 percent), a descent to the foot of the Col de Peyresourde (9.7km at 7.8 pct), a very short downhill and the final ascent to Peyragudes (2.4km at 8.4 pct) with gradients reaching 20 percent. Froome said he would ride conservatively to defend his yellow jersey, and LeMond, who won the Tour in 1986, 1989 and 1990, is wondering whether his rivals will go all-in. So far, only Italian Fabio Aru, second in the general classification 18 seconds down, and France's Romain Bardet, who is in third 51 seconds off the pace, have attacked the Briton.  Aru, Bardet, who knows if they are going to really race?  said LeMond, who believes Froome's rivals have no real wish to go for the throat.  I question the desire (of Froome's rivals) to go for it instead of just keeping their place,  he said.  I'd love to see more aggressive riding from (Bardet's) AG2R-La Mondiale. Isolating Froome will be key. I would do what it takes to eliminate Sky riders.  Although alliances between teams rarely materialize, LeMond believes that Froome's rivals should be relentless.  You need multiple people to attack multiple times,  he said.  But if anything, Froome could counter attack.  With a final time trial in Marseille favoring Froome, the Briton could on Thursday virtually put the hammer down on the Tour.

Household debt in Canada is the highest among Group of Seven countries.     The Bank of Canada has warned that record debt combined with rapidly rising home prices pose a risk to the financial system. After its 25 basis point rate increase on Wednesday, the central bank acknowledged that the economy may be more sensitive to higher interest rates than in the past given the country's amount of household debt.   We will need to gauge carefully the effects of higher interest rates on the economy,  the bank wrote. The Bank of Canada raised its official interest rate to 0.75 percent from 0.5 percent, the first increase since 2010. The five major commercial banks, led by Royal Bank of Canada, raised their prime lending rate to 2.95 percent from 2.7 percent, effective Thursday. Higher interest rates are beneficial for banks because their net interest margins, the difference between the interest they get from borrowers and what they pay to savers, improves, resulting in increased profitability. Analysts say the initial 0.25 percent hike may not have a material impact on earnings but further anticipated increases could boost profitability, particularly in 2018, potentially helping offset slowing housing markets in Toronto and Vancouver.

Campbell said this would not initially be a problem for consumers, but, she said, low savings and a lack of retirement planning could lead to more bankruptcies if rates rise again this year as expected.  Canadian households owed $1.67 in debt for every dollar in disposable income in June. Since 2009 when the housing boom started, total household debt has risen 51.5 percent to C$2 trillion and mortgages account for about 66 percent of that, according to Statistics Canada.    People are living too close to the edge,  said Scott Hannah, president of the Credit Counseling Society.  If you are carrying non-mortgage debt, you need a plan to eliminate this debt.      Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz told reporters,  I know not everybody will think a higher interest rate is good news, but it's a symptom of an improving economy.  Interest rates are still very low, so we're coming off a very low level.  Brad Lamb, a Toronto-based property developer, said in a telephone interview that higher borrowing costs were unlikely to cool Canada's hot real estate market.  Demand for housing is growing.

The U.S. Federal Trade Commission filed a lawsuit in June aimed at stopping the merger, arguing that the combined company would control more than 90 percent of the U.S. market for paid daily fantasy sports contests. The lawsuit was the latest setback for the two companies, which have faced regulatory challenges in several states.

The companies also said their deal would be good for consumers and argued that they competed for players against larger, more powerful companies in the broader and longer- running fantasy sports businesses, like ESPN and Yahoo .  DraftKings admits that fantasy sports include, but are not limited to, both season-long fantasy sports ( SLFS ) and DFS (daily fantasy sports), but specifically denies the characterization that SLFS and DFS are distinct,  the company said in its filing.

Participants typically create teams that span an entire season in professional sports, including American football, baseball, basketball and hockey. Daily fantasy sports, which focus on single-day contests, have developed over the past decade into a multibillion-dollar industry. The FTC has asked the court for a preliminary injunction to prevent the companies from closing the deal while it proceeds with an internal review to determine if the merger is legal.

The man behind the confiscation of General Motors Co’s $100 million assembly plant in April is a much more obscure figure: Kaled Kansao, the owner of two long-defunct GM dealerships. Kansao convinced a court to seize the plant as the remedy for a relatively small-time business dispute - over GM's termination of his franchises - that mushroomed into a 17-year court battle. The legal fight that pushed GM out of Venezuela offers a unique case study in the struggles of foreign corporations to keep operations afloat - much less turn a profit - amid the OPEC nation's economic and political chaos. The seizure stands out because it stems from a dispute with private citizens rather than the government, highlighting yet another risk of doing business in Venezuela – the specter of debilitating legal judgments, said Francisco Martinez, president of Venezuela's main business organization, Fedecamaras.  It would be impossible to say that the legal proceedings against General Motors had any legal logic,  Martinez said.  Venezuela does not provide even the most minimal guarantees with respect to investment or private property.  The Venezuelan government's Information Ministry did not respond to a request for comment. Venezuela ranked 187 out of 190 countries in the World Bank's 2017 Ease of Doing Business report, which evaluates countries' regulatory systems. Only Eritrea, Libya and Somalia scored worse. Under Chavez, the socialist firebrand who died in 2013, some asset seizures featured gun-wielding soldiers and live television broadcasts. The GM case had its own less publicized drama, including dueling allegations of courthouse misdeeds; recusals by judges citing security concerns; a dispute over 158 vehicles that GM says  vanished ; and mysterious damage calculations awarding the dealers thousands of cars. GM stopped producing vehicles here in 2015 amid a lack of access to supplies. But the judgment appears to have doused any remaining hopes that it will produce cars again in Venezuela anytime soon. The company terminated the plant's 2,700 workers after the decision. In its initial announcement in April, GM did not connect the plant seizure to the dealers' lawsuit, saying only that the facility was  unexpectedly  seized by  public authorities.  In response to inquiries from Reuters, the company provided a detailed history of its frustrations with the proceedings, which it called  absurd  and rife with  irregularities.  In the end, a civil court in the western state of Zulia granted the dealers' request to attach GM assets worth up to about $115 million.  Venezuelan law requires the court to auction off the factory to satisfy the judgment. In the meantime, it ordered GM to pay the dealers to pay an  occupation fee  that at the time equated to about $36,000 a month - in effect, rent on its own plant.  The illegal and outrageous seizure was the final act of a series of unfortunate events beyond GMV's control,  GM told Reuters, referring to its Venezuela subsidiary. GM did not respond to questions about whether it had any intention of paying the court judgments or trying to regain control of the factory. In a May press statement, Kansao and his business partner, Elena Rodriguez, accused GM of perjury, influence trafficking, and violation of the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, without offering evidence. GM has ignored court rulings because it believes  might is right as a law,  Kansao told Reuters. Idled Workers Collect Salaries Back in 2000, Kansao and Rodriguez operated two GM dealerships that had originally been founded by Kansao's father. In an interview, Kansao said GM arbitrarily stripped him of his franchise, which he said brought  tragedy and calamity  on his family. FILE PHOTO: A water tank with the GM logo is seen at the General Motors Assembly Plant in Valencia, April 21, 2017.Marco Bello/File PhotoGM said it terminated the agreement for a range of reasons, including the dealers' failure to meet a minimum monthly sales average of 25 vehicles. Nearly two decades later, the dealers' hopes of collecting on the judgment now hinge on whether a court-ordered auction attracts a buyer - an unlikely prospect in a nation where the auto industry has all but collapsed. Chronic shortages of hard currency have left automakers unable to import parts, while triple digit inflation has left would-be customers struggling to buy basics like food and medicine. In 2016, output at Venezuela's seven biggest auto plants had dropped below 3,000 cars, down from a peak of 172,000 vehicles in 2007 – 79,000 of those from GM, according to auto industry group Cavenez. Labor laws dictate that the dealers would also have to wait behind GM workers - who contend they are owed severance payments - to collect any proceeds from a factory auction. GM did not respond to questions about workers' severance. The automaker had agreed with union leaders to continue paying workers after the plant stopped making cars, said Adan Tortolero, one of several union leaders at the defunct plant. FILE PHOTO: The GM logo is seen at the General Motors Assembly Plant in Valencia, April 21, 2017.Marco Bello/File PhotoGM tried to shed that obligation last year by offering buyouts of about $3,500 per worker, Tortolero said, but workers spurned the offer because it seemed small in comparison to the pay and benefits the workers had previously enjoyed. One lucrative perk was the right to buy two factory cars every year at government-regulated prices that were well below their actual market value. The regulated prices were theoretically available to anyone, but because demand for cars far outstripped supply, most buyers had to get waiting lists – which usually required large under-the-table payments. GM employees had been among the first in line to buy the cars at regulated prices, which allowed them to sell the vehicles at a steep premium. 9,725 Cars In 2007, the Zulia court ordered the automaker to compensate the plaintiffs with 9,725 vehicles, according to the decision, which offered no explanation for that number of cars. It did require the plaintiffs to pay GM for the vehicles, but only after they were sold. Asked to provide evidence that the proceedings had been corrupted, GM pointed out that six judges and two court employees had recused themselves, with most citing  threats and personal security concerns.  It also said that the court failed to enforce an order preventing the dealers from selling 158 cars that they seized during the dispute. GM said those vehicles later  vanished,  and the dealers never paid for them. Kansao and Rodriguez did not respond to questions about the 158 cars. The case bounced through different courts for the next decade until April 4 of this year, when the Zulia court authorized the plaintiffs to encumber GM assets worth up to 477 billion bolivars - at the time worth about $115 million - as leverage to collect a cash judgment of half that amount. The court based the compensation on the full value of the 9,725 cars - rather than the much smaller profit the dealers would have made selling them, GM said. But the legal victory may have little payoff in reality, just as GM's losses may be largely symbolic - given that it hasn't produced or sold cars in Venezuela since 2015. Asked what sort of buyer the factory might attract in a government auction, Kansao responded:  Only God knows that.

Ghana, the world's second largest producer and top grower Ivory Coast, which together account for more than 60 percent of the world's cocoa supply, have been hit by a sharp drop in world prices that have seen cocoa futures plummet by around a third. While Ivory Coast responded by slashing its guaranteed farmgate prices, Ghana has maintained the price at which it buys cocoa from farmers since the season opened in October. Ghana exports at least 70 percent of its beans mainly to Europe through forward contracts.  Ghana, under my presidency, will no longer become mere producers and exporters of cocoa beans, and will continue the policy of processing more and more of our cocoa,  Akufo-Addo told reporters after a meeting with Swiss President Doris Leuthard in Accra.

The state, which still faces major financial challenges, would have been the first U.S. state to be rated junk.  Through a combination of spending cuts and tax increases, the budget package brings the state's revenue and expenditure base much closer to structural alignment and reduces the near-term uncertainty that had come to characterize its financial operations,  the credit rating agency said in a statement. Besides affirming the lowest level investment grade rating for Illinois, S&P; also gave the rating a stable outlook. But it warned that outlook could be short-lived if the state does not implement a plan included in the fiscal 2018 budget to begin shrinking a bill backlog that ballooned to $15 billion during the unprecedented two-year political impasse.  The state will almost certainly suffer an extended fiscal hangover from the impasse, not least from its record level of unpaid bills, which will be a drain on its future resources,  S&P; noted. The $36 billion budget for the fiscal year that began July 1 marked the first for Illinois since 2015. The spending plan calls for the issuance of up to $6 billion of 12-year bonds, along with borrowing or tapping money from various state accounts to put an $8 billion dent in the backlog. Aided by some Republican votes, the Democratic-controlled legislature last Thursday overrode Republican Governor Bruce Rauner's veto of the spending plan and a $5 billion income rate hike. S&P; said the new budget does not comprehensively address Illinois' $130 billion unfunded pension liability but incorporates a $1.4 billion drop in the state's fiscal 2018 pension contributions. The decrease is mainly due to a new five-year smoothing of higher contributions resulting from actuarial changes by the state's five retirement systems. S&P; called that move  a cost deferral more than a genuine expenditure reduction.  It also said the budget's banking on $500 million from the creation of a hybrid pension plan for new hires  may prove premature.  S&P; affirmed the AA-minus rating on Build Illinois sales tax revenue bonds and BB-plus rating on the state's appropriation-backed debt, which includes Chicago motor fuel tax bonds. Illinois remains under review by Moody's Investors Service, which rates the state Baa3, one notch above junk, and by Fitch Ratings, which has the state at BBB, two notches above junk.

The Juno probe logged its close encounter with Jupiter's most distinctive feature on Monday evening Pacific time as it passed about 5,600 miles (9,000 kilometers) above the clouds of the mammoth cyclone. But it will take days for readings captured by Juno's array of cameras and other instruments to be delivered to scientists at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California, and much longer still for the data to be analyzed. Scientists hope the exercise will help unlock such mysteries as what forces are driving the storm, how long it has existed, how deeply it penetrates the planet's lower atmosphere and why it appears to be gradually dissipating. Astronomers also believe a greater understanding of the Great Red Spot may yield clues to the structure, mechanics and formation of Jupiter as a whole.  This is a storm bigger than the entire Earth. It's been there for hundreds of years. We want to know what makes it tick,  said Steve Levin, the lead project scientist for the Juno mission at JPL. The Great Red Spot on Jupiter is shown in this NASA Juno spacecraft photo released on July 12, 2017.  Courtesy NASA/Handout via REUTERSLevin said the storm is believed to be powered by energy oozing from Jupiter's interior combined with rotation of the planet, but the precise inner workings are unknown.  Some of the most valuable data from Monday's flyby is expected to come from an instrument designed to peer into the red spot at six different depths, Levin said. Slideshow (4 Images)The churning cyclone ranks as the largest known storm in the solar system, measuring about 10,000 miles (16,000 km) in diameter with winds clocked at hundreds of miles (km) an hour around its outer edges. It appears as a deep, red orb surrounded by layers of pale yellow, orange and white. The red spot has been continuously monitored from Earth since about 1830, though observations believed to have been of the same feature date back more than 350 years.  Once wide enough to swallow three Earth-sized planets, the famed Jovian weather system has been shrinking for the past 100 years and may eventually disappear altogether. Still, the spot remains the most prominent characteristic of the solar system's largest planet, a gargantuan ball of gas -- mostly hydrogen and helium -- 11 times the diameter of Earth with more than twice as much mass as all the other planets combined. Monday's encounter with the Great Red Spot was the latest of 12 flyby missions currently scheduled by NASA for Juno, which is to make its next close approach to Jupiter's cloud tops on Sept. 1.

Enbridge Inc has taken a natural gas compressor station offline but it said on Wednesday that there had been no significant reduction in volumes shipped.  The fires have disrupted timber and mining operations, damaged a regional electric utility and forced more than 14,000 people from their homes in the interior of the province. On Friday, British Columbia declared its first state of emergency since 2003. Enbridge did not specify which pipeline system the station was on, saying only that it was in the affected area, a region ranging from 150 km (95 miles) to 350 km northeast of Vancouver where more than 200 fires were burning. Kinder Morgan Canada Ltd, a unit of Kinder Morgan Inc, removed vegetation along its Trans Mountain pipeline, created a fire break and added sprinklers to keep the area wet, Chief Operating Officer Hugh Harden said in a statement.  The company said the fires were about 16 km away from a pump station in Blackpool, British Columbia.  EnGold Mines Ltd has suspended all exploration in the region and Imperial Metals Corp said it had significantly reduced operations at one of its mines.   West Fraser Timber Co and privately held Tolko, among the largest Canadian producers of forestry products, and Norbord Inc, the world's largest maker of oriented strand board, a plywood-like material used in house building, have suspended operations.

A defense ministry spokesman told Reuters that development of new  aviation cyber expertise  would cover everything from raising consciousness about cyber threats to technical research projects and equipping aircraft with protective systems. State Secretary Katrin Suder had backed the idea, which Major General Ansgar Rieks, head of the German Military Aviation Authority, proposed in a letter in June, the spokesman said. Rieks said last week that he was unnerved by a demonstration by the government-funded German Aerospace Center (DLR) in Bavaria showing hackers could take control of an aircraft with inexpensive equipment.  That frightens me. I wrote to the state secretary about it and said doing nothing would amount to gross negligence,  he said at a talk at a conference in Bueckeburg, Germany. He said the issue was also a vital concern for civil aviation.   He said military officials needed to focus not just on potential problems with computer software, but should also work to  ensure that airplanes cannot be taken over from the ground, or possibly by a passenger in the air . A spokesman for the DLR, which has studied aviation cyber security extensively, had no immediate comment on the issue. Germany's military this year launched a new cyber command that groups cyber units from across the military, which will also involved in the new aviation cyber initiative. Cyber resilience - making sure that systems can survive a cyber attack and keep functioning - was a major topic during a conference at Bundeswehr University Munich last month, the DLR spokesman said. Germany's military is also working on the aviation cyber issue within the European Union and NATO, he said. Concerns about cyber attacks on aircraft and in the broader aviation sector have grown sharply in recent years with a growing barrage of attacks and breaches against other sectors. Many experts fear that the aviation industry has not kept pace with the threat hackers pose to increasingly computer-connected airplanes.  Rapid adoption of communication protocols similar to those used on the internet to connect cockpits, cabins and ground controls, have left air traffic open to vulnerabilities bedevilling other sectors such as finance and oil and gas.

Fed policymakers last month agreed on a basic plan for reducing the balance sheet, built up over years of bond purchases in an effort to reduce long-term borrowing costs and spur investment after the 2007-2009 financial crisis. They remain split on exactly when to start those reductions. Some like are George pushing for doing so soon in order to limit the possibility of an asset bubble or other distortion that could ultimately spark another crisis or recession.  Holding long-term rates below the level that they might otherwise move to naturally, amidst improving economic fundamentals, risks creating financial imbalances,  George said in remarks prepared for delivery at a Kansas City Fed economic forum in Denver, Colo.  While the Fed has raised short-term interest rates two times this year and expects to do so again before the end of the year, longer-term rates have not risen much in response. A narrow gap between short-term and long-term borrowing costs can distort investment decisions, George said; shrinking the balance sheet could allow long-term rates to rise gradually.   Current asset valuations and low implied volatility in stock and bond markets may be signaling investor complacency, she said.   The failure of longer-term rates to move up with short-term rates during this normalization cycle illustrates the risk for a disruptive repricing of assets as markets adjust to a more normal policy stance,  George warned, adding that such potential for disruption underscores the need to make sure that the largest U.S. banks are well-capitalized and able to withstand a financial shock.

We've been collaborating with the investigation because we have the biggest stake in this being cleared up,  Humala told reporters outside his home in Lima, where he spoke beside his wife and the co-founder of his political party, Nadine Heredia. A hearing is scheduled for Wednesday and, if Judge Richard Concepcion approves Juarez' request, Humala would become the second former Peruvian leader sought for arrest since Odebrecht acknowledged publicly last year that it bribed officials across Latin America over a decade-long period.

Toledo, believed to be in the United States, denies wrongdoing and has refused to turn himself in. In Peru, the Odebrecht scandal has so far mostly tarnished the reputations of left-leaning Humala and centrist Toledo - allowing their right-wing critics to portray them as hypocrites for railing against graft in the government of their predecessor, former autocratic president Alberto Fujimori.

Juarez said two of Odebrecht's former executives have testified that they arranged to send $3 million for Humala's 2011 campaign on orders from the Workers Party of Brazil. The money was the product of corruption, Juarez said. Juarez also alleged that Humala's 2006 campaign was financed with money that Chavez stole from Venezuela's treasury. Humala ran an unsuccessful presidential bid in 2006 as an ally of Chavez before winning the 2011 election after recasting himself as a more moderate leftist in the style of Brazil's former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who founded the Workers Party.

An advisory panel to the Food and Drug Administration voted 10-0 that the drug, tisagenlecleucel, should be approved to treat patients with relapsed B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the most common form of U.S. childhood cancer. The FDA is not obliged to follow the recommendations of its advisers but typically does so. The agency is expected to rule on the drug by the end of September. Approval of tisagenlecleucel would have significant implications not only for Novartis but for companies developing similar treatments, including Kite Pharma Inc, Juno Therapeutics Inc and bluebird bio Inc. All four are developing chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapies (CAR-T), which harness the body's own immune cells to recognize and attack malignant cells. If approved, the drugs, which are infused just once, are expected to cost up to $500,000 and generate billions of dollars for their developers. Success would also help advance a cancer-fighting technique that scientists have been trying to perfect for decades and lift the broader field of cell therapy.  In the last five years there have been a significant number of cell therapy companies that have gone public or gotten investment in hopes of moving this type of therapy forward,  said Reni Benjamin, an analyst at Raymond James.  This is our first glimpse from a commercial and regulatory perspective about how the FDA is thinking about this space.  A clinical trial of Novartis's drug showed that 83 percent of patients who had relapsed or failed chemotherapy, achieved complete or partial remission three months post infusion. Patients with ALL who fail chemotherapy typically have only a 16 to 30 percent chance of survival. Novartis is also testing the drug in diffuse large b-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL), the most common form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, as is Kite. Part of the competitive landscape will include which company is best able to manufacture its product most efficiently and reliably. The products are made by extracting and isolating a patient's T cells, genetically engineering them to recognize and target specific cancer cells, and then infusing them back into the patient. Novartis said the entire process will take 22 days by the time it is launched. More than half of patients experienced a serious complication known as cytokine release syndrome (CRS) which occurs when the body's immune system goes into overdrive. Doctors were able to manage the condition and the syndrome caused no deaths. The FDA expressed concern that the drug could cause new malignancies over the long term, but panelists generally felt that risk was low.

Trump was installed by the Russians, because they wanted to undermine American democracy and embarrass our country. Mission accomplished. Trump is a joke,  Representative Scott Hamann wrote in a comment posted to a friend's Facebook page on Tuesday.  Trump is a half-term president, at most, especially if I ever get within 10 feet of that pussy.      The chair of the state Republican party, Demi Kouzounas, called on the Democratic speaker of the Maine House of Representatives to take action after Hamann posted his lengthy message about Trump late on Tuesday.      Perhaps the most alarming aspect of this tirade is an implied death threat against our president,  Kouzounas said in a statement.  The best way I can describe these comments is simple: Unhinged, dangerous.  Hamann, a third-term representative, said in a statement that he regretted his words.  While the tone of the post was born out of frustration with the vile language currently surrounding politics, I should not have responded with the same language,  he said.  This is not language I typically use, it does not reflect my personal values.

In remarks to the House Committee on Financial Services, Yellen said the U.S. economy is strong enough to absorb further gradual rate increases and the slow wind-down of the Fed's massive bond portfolio. The testimony depicted an economy that is growing, albeit slowly, and continues to add jobs as it benefits from steady household consumption and a recent jump in business investment. Given current estimates, the federal funds rate  would not have to rise all that much further  to reach a neutral level that neither encourages nor discourages economic activity, Yellen said in her prepared testimony. Equities rose on the view the Fed's monetary policy is not going to be as aggressive as some had anticipated, said Larry Hatheway, chief economist at asset management firm GAM.  The Fed isn't really going to upset the apple cart,  Hatheway said.  There's some softening here of what the Fed is going to do at least around rates. It doesn't necessarily answer the question around its balance sheet.

On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 146.04 points, or 0.68 percent, to 21,555.11, above a high set on July 3. The S&P; 500 gained 19.88 points, or 0.82 percent, to 2,445.41 and the Nasdaq Composite added 68.93 points, or 1.11 percent, to 6,262.23. Bond yields, which move in reverse of price, fell sharply. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note yield fell to 2.302 percent, its lowest in two weeks, before paring some gains to trade at 2.3231. At the front end of the curve, the two-year yield dropped as low as 1.331 percent from 1.379 percent on Tuesday and last traded at 1.3510 percent. Germany's 10-year government bond yield fell to 0.511 percent. The dollar, which fell against the euro soon after the release of Yellen's prepared remarks, reversed course and was trading near session highs against the common currency, as government bond yields in the euro area fell. The dollar index rose 0.1 percent, with the euro down 0.43 percent to $1.1416. The Japanese yen strengthened 0.6 percent to trade at 113.24 per dollar. Spot gold was up 0.23 percent at $1,220.09 an ounce. U.S. gold futures for August delivery settled up $4.40 at $1,219.1 per ounce. Oil futures pared gains despite a bigger-than-expected decline in U.S. crude stocks as the drawdown was not as big as reported by the American Petroleum Institute on Tuesday. U.S. crude inventories fell 7.6 million barrels last week, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said, much more than the 2.9 million-barrel crude draw forecast but slightly less than the 8.1 million-barrel decline reported by the API.

Lula, who was sentenced to nine and a half years in prison,  would be barred from office if his guilty verdict is upheld by an appeals court, which is expected to take at least eight months to rule.     Many traders fear Lula, a leftist who has consistently led voting polls for the 2018 presidential elections, could overturn Temer's efforts to curb growth of public debt and implement sweeping structural reforms.      This makes traders hopeful that the government's market-friendly platform may extend beyond 2018,  Renascença brokerage trader Thiago Castro said.  Still, there's a long way to go before we see a ruling by the appeals court.      The Brazilian real gained as much as 1.5 percent to its strongest since May 17, when news broke of a corruption scandal threatening to derail Temer's agenda drove the currency sharply lower.     The benchmark Bovespa stock index rose to a session high, supported by a rally in shares of state-controlled oil company Petróleo Brasileiro SA.     Brazilian markets traded higher throughout the day after an overhaul of the country's labor laws won Senate approval by a wider margin than expected, suggesting lawmaker support for Temer's reform agenda remained strong despite the corruption scandal.     Many investors see the reform, part of a package of structural reforms that also includes measures to streamline country's bloated pension system, as crucial to Brazil's long-term growth.       Other Latin American markets advanced after Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen indicated that the U.S. central bank may raise interest rates less than previously suggested.     Yellen said in testimony to the U.S. Congress that interest rates  would not have to rise all that much further  to reach what the Fed considers a neutral rate. A slower pace of rate hikes would increase the allure of high-yielding emerging market assets.     The Mexican peso surged to a more than one-year high, bolstered by growing confidence that U.S. President Donald Trump will not pull out of NAFTA, as well as a major oil discovery.     Expectations that Trump will not shred the North American Free Trade Agreement have fed demand for the peso and helped make it the top-performing emerging-markets currency this year, with a 17 percent gain. On Wednesday it was 3 percent stronger than just before Trump won the election.

Property for Her was launched on social media this week, with messages on Twitter and Facebook, as well as a petition on change.org. The petition asks parents to promise to leave their daughter an equal share of property, and brothers to stand with their sisters in ensuring her rights.   A lot of violence against women is related to property,  said activist Kamla Bhasin, who helped launch the campaign.  We have a lot of legislation guaranteeing equal rights, but it is not implemented because the lawmakers, the police, the judges, the citizens are not gender just. With this campaign, we want to change people's mindsets about property for women.  Across India, only 13 percent of farmland is owned by women, according to census data. With their names missing from property titles, women are in danger of being thrown out when the husband dies, with the property going to the sons or the husband's brothers. Despite a 2005 national law that gave women equal inheritance rights, customary law often prevails and women are forced by their brothers or fathers to give up their claim on ancestral property.. Among Muslims, who are governed by their personal law in matters on inheritance, women are only entitled to half the man's share of property,  Despite the laws, our rights are not guaranteed and women are made to feel bad when they demand their share of property,  said Arti Pandey, co-founder of women's rights group Bitiya, who launched the petition on change.org.  We have to depend on the charity of our brothers and our husbands. Property rights can give us economic independence so we don't have to depend on anyone,  she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. The #PropertyforHer campaign is being promoted with slogans such as:  Beti dill mein, beti will mein  (Your daughter in your heart and in your will). Several states offer lower rate mortgages and cheaper registration charges when a property is registered in the name of a woman to encourage this practice. Land or property that is distributed by the state also have joint ownership titles.  This campaign is not going to guarantee property rights for women right away, but it can be a spark to bring about a change in the patriarchal mindset that prevents its adoption,  said Sandeep Chachra, executive director of right group ActionAid India, which is backing the campaign.

Stubbornly slow-growing Italy proposed in June to cut its structural budget deficit by 0.3 percent of gross domestic product next year, sharply reducing a previous pledge and potentially dodging an unpopular sales tax hike. In a letter addressed to Economy Minister Pier Carlo Padoan on Wednesday, European Commission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis and Economics Commissioner Pierre Moscovici suggested the rules could be bent in some circumstances.  The Commission may in some cases consider as adequate a fiscal adjustment somewhat below the requirement prescribed by the matrix,  the letter posted on the Italian Treasury's website said. The EU's executive will also take into account the need to support Italy's economic recovery, it said, while adding that the government must still deliver  a significant fiscal adjustment,  and ensure a fall in the public debt. The assessment of Italy's 2018 budget, to be presented by mid-October, would  primarily  take into account whether it cuts public spending net of debt servicing costs, the letter said.

The Commission's letter was  good news , Gentiloni told reporters at a news conference in the northern city of Trieste. Italy's June proposal backtracked on a previous plan to cut the structural deficit, which excludes one-off items and the effects of the business cycle, by 0.8 percent of output in 2018. The ruling Democratic Party (PD) is anxious to avoid severe belt-tightening measures ahead of a national election next Spring. PD leader Matteo Renzi ruffled feathers in Brussels this week by proposing that Italy should actually raise its deficit to 2.9 percent of GDP and hold it at that level for five years, to allow for tax cuts to try to boost growth.

In a newly filed complaint in Manhattan State Supreme Court, the Pimco funds are asking for a declaratory judgment that Wells Fargo is not entitled to use MBS trust money to fund its defense against noteholder claims that the bank breached its duties as an MBS trustee. Pimco’s lawyers at Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossmann allege that Wells Fargo has improperly reserved about $95 million across 20 MBS trusts.  The Pimco complaint is the latest wrinkle in increasingly complex litigation between MBS noteholders and trustees. Pimco is one of several major institutional investors pursuing Wells Fargo, Deutsche Bank, HSBC and other MBS trustees for supposedly failing to take action against MBS sponsors as the trusts began to lose money. As I’ve reported, noteholders have managed to get past trustee dismissal motions in several big cases in state and federal court, but still face the considerable obstacle of providing loan-specific proof that trustees were obliged to demand the repurchase of deficient underlying mortgages and didn’t live up to that obligation.  The trustees have aggressively defended the cases. In May, for example, Wells Fargo’s lawyers at Jones Day filed third-party complaints in Manhattan federal court against the advisory arms of three of the funds suing the trustee, claiming that the advisory firms knew as much as Wells Fargo about problems in the MBS market and should be jointly liable if the trustee is socked with a judgment for tort damages.  The new Pimco complaint alleges that Wells Fargo is improperly paying its lawyers in the trustee breach cases with money that rightfully belongs to noteholders. The trustee’s litigation reserves were exposed in April, according to the complaint, when an entity called New Residential Investment Corp exercised rights to call in Wells-overseen trusts with an unpaid principal balance of about $309.5 million. The complaint alleges that Wells Fargo withheld $57.2 million to establish “trustee reserve accounts” to cover legal expenses stemming from litigation over its conduct as trustee. (Nomura analysts disclosed the Wells Fargo reserve accounts in a report in June.)  Pimco contends Wells Fargo is not permitted, under the MBS contracts for the 11 trusts at issue in its suit, to use trust money to defend against allegations of willful wrongdoing, bad faith or negligence. Those are precisely the claims at issue in noteholder litigation against the MBS trustee, according to the complaint. “Neither the (MBS contracts) nor the law permit Wells Fargo’s taxing of the investors it was supposed to protect to indemnify itself and to finance its actual and expected defense costs,” the complaint said.  Pimco’s suit isn’t the first time a noteholder has raised questions about the funding of an MBS trustee’s defense in this wave of investor litigation. In March, lawyers for Royal Park Investment (RPI) moved for a court order requiring MBS trustee Deutsche Bank to disclose any legal fees and expenses it had billed to MBS trusts at issue in RPI’s case against the trustee. Like Pimco in the new Wells Fargo case, RPI and its lawyers from Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd claimed that the trust contracts did not indemnify Deutsche Bank for claims of negligence or misconduct.  Deutsche Bank’s lawyers from Morgan Lewis & Bockius countered that the trust agreements expressly indemnify the MBS trustee from fees and costs associated with its duties as trustee. The judge overseeing the dispute, U.S. Magistrate Barbara Moses of Manhattan, ruled that RPI’s request was outside the scope of her jurisdiction. She suggested that if RPI wanted to pursue the matter, it should file a preliminary injunction motion – although she also warned at oral argument that if she were RPI, “I wouldn’t be terribly optimistic about the outcome of that motion.” (There’s no indication in the RPI docket that Robbins Geller filed a preliminary injunction motion on Deutsche Bank’s legal fees.)  Wells Fargo sent an email statement on the new Pimco suit. The bank said that as an MBS trustee, it “is entitled to indemnification of its legal fees and expenses under the contractual agreements at issue. We believe the lawsuit filed by the Pimco funds has no merit and will be vigorously defending the claim.”  Pimco counsel Blair Nicholas of Bernstein Litowitz declined to provide a statement.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-otc-pimco-idUSKBN19X2NV"},

Buffett,ONCOR,MandA/ELLIOTT,Americas,United States","sector":"Homepage","content":"WILMINGTON, Del. (Reuters) - An attorney for Elliott Management on Wednesday complained to a bankruptcy court judge that the owner of Texas's largest power distribution business did not provide the investment fund with information needed to line up financing for its offer of more than $18 billion to buy the company. Instead, Energy Future Holdings Corp, the bankrupt majority owner of Oncor Electric Delivery Co, struck a deal this month to sell its ownership of the business to Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc for $9 billion in cash, valuing the company at $18.1 billion. A lawyer for Elliott Management, which spent years battling Argentina over its defaulted debt, told the court that the fund has enough debt in Oncor's parent, Energy Future, to block the Berkshire deal. The fund has argued that its own $18.5 billion Oncor deal would be better for creditors. Gregg Galardi, Elliott's lawyer, said potential sources of financing for a rival bid had contacted Elliott, a $32 billion fund led by billionaire Paul Singer, but Energy Future had ignored requests for information to help structure a deal.  We need actual cooperation,  he said. Galardi also noted that Energy Future had not run an auction. Chad Husnick, who represents Energy Future, countered that Elliott had not signed a non-disclosure agreement with Oncor and said Energy Future would not shop its Oncor stake when Elliott had no committed financing.  My response is, show me the money and we’ll consider it,  he said. Husnick also told the hearing in Wilmington, Delaware, that the Berkshire plan could be confirmed. Two previous deals for Oncor, with Hunt Consolidated Inc and another with NextEra Energy, were rejected by Texas's Public Utility Commission after the plans were confirmed by the bankruptcy court. Husnick said the Berkshire proposal has already been discussed with PUC staff. He said Energy Future anticipates quick regulatory approval and then confirmation of the plan by the bankruptcy court, an approach that Judge Christopher Sontchi said he supported. Elliott has estimated creditors will be repaid around 24 cents on the dollar under the Berkshire proposal, compared to 80 cents under the deal NextEra Energy that was blocked by Texas regulators. A hearing on the schedule for reviewing the Berkshire plan was set for July 26. Energy Future has been in bankruptcy since 2014, filing after a consortium of private equity firms bought it for about $44 billion.

In an interview before a presentation to investors, Paola Tapia said she has received interest from companies in China, France, Spain, England, Australia, Mexico, and Brazil, some of whom were looking to use Santiago as a jumping off point to compete in more bus auctions throughout the region.  From the point of view of the number of participants, this has been a success, and we hope that it consolidates into concrete offers,  Tapia said, adding that the ministry wanted to award the contract before March, when the current government ends.  We think this business opportunity has to do not only with arriving in Chile, but also expanding to other countries throughout the region,  she added. Chile, like neighboring Argentina, is trying to attract private investment to improve its ports, roads and airports, and two major candidates in November's presidential election have also pledged to dramatically expand the nation's transport network. Included in the contract is the replacement of half of the 'Transantiago' transport system - some 3,300 buses - with a more modern, environmentally friendly fleet, including at least 90 electric vehicles. The current system, with long wait times and frequent breakdowns, is widely unpopular, and has become a black eye for the current government of President Michelle Bachelet. Among the companies interested, Tapia said, are Kowloon Motor Bus Company and MTR Corp Ltd (0066.HK), which both operate in Hong Kong.

Sainsbury's, the world's largest retailer of Fairtrade products, started stamping its own  Fairly Traded  label on its own brand tea in May as part of a pilot scheme to move to an internally managed ethical sourcing scheme. The retailer said its initiative improved on the 25-year-old Fairtrade model in which companies can use the trusted logo if they guaranteed farmers a fair price for crops and an extra premium to spend on community projects like roads and schools. But the supermarket's decision has prompted concerns that poor farmers would be impacted and the pilot could lead to the logo being dropped from other products and spread to other companies - especially after Cadbury quit the scheme last year.  An online petition opposing the move now has more than 70,000 signatures while on Wednesday campaigners from charities Oxfam and Cafod, in tea bag costumes and waving placards, protested outside the company's annual general meeting.  Sainsbury's is removing what little control some of the poorest tea farmers and producers have on how they spend the money they make,  Matthew Spencer, Oxfam's campaigns director, said in a statement. Under Fairtrade, on top of earnings from their produce, farming communities receive a bonus, or premium, worth about 10 percent of the tea price which they collectively decide how to spend.  The money usually goes towards healthcare, education and housing projects, said Spencer. But he said with Sainsbury's pilot, farmers would have to apply to a board set up by the supermarket in Britain to receive the money and described the change as a  power grab .  We don't believe the execution of this current model will, on balance, deliver positive changes for tea farmers,  added Michael Gidney, chief executive of the Fairtrade Foundation.  But a spokesman for Sainsbury's denied the farmers would lose out, saying farmers would continue to receive all the funding currently in place and the pilot had safeguards to ensure the money reached  those it is intended for .  'Fairly Traded' goes further than the current model with more benefits, including longer-term commercial relationships and individually-tailored data and support to help them make their businesses more resilient and sustainable,  Sainsbury's Chief Executive Mike Coupe said in a statement.  Coupe added that the pilot didn't save the supermarket any money and had no impact on the price of its tea. Fairtrade products usually lead to a slightly higher retail price.  Rather than shout from the sidelines, we would encourage everyone to be open-minded and see if the pilot can be successful and improve lives,  Coupe said.

Yet most children seek refuge in other African nations, and only one in five attempt the perilous journey to Europe, UNICEF said in a report.         Half a million people have crossed the Mediterranean from Libya to Italy over the past four years, mainly sub-Saharan Africans who pay smugglers to shepherd them across the desert to Libya, and onward to Europe in unseaworthy dinghies. At least 20,000 migrants are being detained in Libya, the main gateway for those attempting to reach Europe by sea, according to the International Organization for Migration.  I went to try to provide for my mother,  said Malik, a 16-year-old Gambian who traveled to Libya in attempt to reach Italy. Malik said he was 15 when he made the journey, but was kidnapped and held ransom by traffickers in Libya for months.  I was beaten with sticks, with lead pipes and with a motorcycle chain. Every day they beat me and demanded money,  he was cited as saying in the report.  I tell boys about what I have seen. If I can stop one person from going then I will be doing something good,  Malik said, who was released with the help of a fellow migrant. Lack of economic opportunities, wars and climate change have forced over 12 million people in West and Central Africa to migrate, UNICEF said in its report. Climate change is already a harsh reality in many parts of Africa, where rising temperatures and increasingly erratic rainfall have disrupted food production, fueled widespread hunger, and forced farmers to abandon their land.  Unless the long-term planning of governments and civil society is equipped to anticipate these climate shocks and subsequent migration, the unmitigated impact of these forces will create detrimental outcomes for children across the region,  the report said. One in five people in Central African Republic - about a million people - have been displaced since conflict began in 2013 between mainly Muslim Seleka rebels and Christian militias, the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) says.     In 2016 alone, more than 922,000 people were driven from their homes by conflict within the Democratic Republic of Congo, compared with 824,000 in Syria, according the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre, which is part of NRC.  Children in West and Central Africa are moving in greater numbers than ever before, many in search of safety or a better life,  said UNICEF regional director Marie-Pierre Poirier.  Yet the majority of these children are moving within Africa, not to Europe or elsewhere. We must broaden the discussion on migration to encompass the vulnerabilities of all children on the move and expand systems to protect them, in all their intended destinations,  she said.

U.S. crude inventories fell 7.6 million barrels last week, its biggest weekly plunge in 10 months, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said. That was much more than the 2.9 million-barrel crude draw forecast in a Reuters poll but was slightly less than the 8.1 million-barrel decline reported by the American Petroleum Institute (API) on Tuesday. ENERGYUSA  But at 495.4 million barrels, U.S. crude oil inventories were in the upper half of the average range for this time of year. U.S. gasoline stocks USOILG=ECI fell 1.6 million barrels, compared with analysts' expectations for a 1.1 million-barrel gain, but were also in the upper half of the average range, EIA said.  U.S. gasoline demand remains lackluster and gasoline stocks are still above the five-year average, which will cap gains in crude and gasoline prices,  said Abhishek Kumar, Senior Energy Analyst at Interfax Energy's Global Gas Analytics in London. Brent crude futures LCOc1 rose 22 cents, or 0.5 percent, to settle at $47.74 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 gained 45 cents, or 1 percent, to settle at $45.49. That bigger gain in U.S. crude, pressured the premium of front-month Brent futures over WTI to $2.08 per barrel, the lowest so far this month. Before the EIA released its storage report, Brent was up 1.9 percent and WTI was up 2.4 percent. Traders noted suggestions from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) that the oil market will see a surplus next year also weighed on Wednesday's price gains.  We are still facing a situation where there is an abundance of oil across the globe and demand is increasing at a pace that only makes a small dent in inventories,  said Mark Watkins, Regional Investment Manager with U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Park City, Utah.  The rebalancing of the supply and demand equilibrium for oil is moving at a snail's pace,  Watkins said. OPEC said its oil production jumped in June and forecast world demand for its crude will decline next year as rivals pump more, pointing to a market surplus in 2018 despite an OPEC-led output cut. Those output cuts, in place since the start of the year, have lent prices some support, but in recent weeks rising output from Libya and Nigeria - OPEC members exempt from the output reduction deal - has pushed supply higher.

Ahmedabad, in the western state of Gujarat, has among the worst air pollution in the country. But it is the first to install an air monitoring and warning system. The Air Information and Response (AIR) plan, launched in May, involves the creation of an air quality index that measures daily pollution levels in eight locations. Giant LED screens display five color-coded alerts of the levels, and their related effects. An early warning system also alerts people to days when pollution is likely to reach the  very poor  or  severe  level.  Air pollution is a major risk, and unless we have data we cannot devise ways to control it and minimize its effect,  said Chirag Shah, a deputy health officer at the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation.  But what good is collecting data if we just keep it in the office and don't use it?  India and China account for more than half of global deaths due to air pollution. The increase in people dying in India from such pollution is forecast to outpace the rate of such deaths in China. India is home to four of the 10 cities in the world with the worst air pollution, measured by the amount of particulate matter under 2.5 micrograms found in every cubic meter of air, according to the World Health Organization. Tiny particulate matter can cause lung cancer, strokes and heart disease over the long term, as well as triggering symptoms such as heart attacks that kill more rapidly.  Too Many Cars The main causes of air pollution in Ahmedabad include diesel-fueled vehicles, construction, cooking fires and the burning of trash. Air quality is particularly bad in the cooler months of November to January. Other Indian cities - Delhi, Mumbai and Pune - also have an air pollution index, but only Ahmedabad has a warning system.   We must invest in measurement and response, or we can't fight it,  said Dileep Mavalankar, head of the Indian Institute of Public Health, which was involved in the AIR plan as well as the Heat Action Plan.  It has to be a collaborative effort with the government, non-profits and experts,  he said. In neighboring Maharashtra state, officials last month launched a star-rating program that uses smokestack emission data to rate industries based on the density of fine particulate pollution. The WHO says more than 7 million premature deaths occur every year due to air pollution, 3 million of them due to outdoor air quality. In Ahmedabad, the response to severe pollution days could include curtailing certain activities, Shah said.  This is about protecting health and saving lives. With data and warnings, we are better able to address it,  Shah said. Reporting by Rina Chandran @rinachandran, Editing by Laurie Goering.

David Wildstein, 55, a former executive at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and a high school classmate of Christie's, provided the key evidence that led to the conviction of two Christie allies.  Were it not for Mr. Wildstein's cooperation, it is unlikely that we are even here today,  Assistant U.S. Attorney Lee Cortes told U.S. District Judge Susan Wigenton in federal court in Newark, New Jersey. The judge sentenced Wildstein to three years of probation, noting that he was the only figure in the scandal to accept responsibility for his actions. Wildstein concocted a scheme to shut down access lanes at the George Washington Bridge in September 2013, causing massive traffic jams as punishment for a local Democratic mayor who declined to support Christie's gubernatorial re-election bid. The bridge between New Jersey and New York City is the world's busiest, according to the Port Authority, which oversees it.

The fallout damaged Christie's unsuccessful 2016 bid for the Republican presidential nomination, and he is now saddled with record-low approval ratings in his final year as governor. Wildstein's co-conspirators, former Christie aide Bridget Kelly and former Port Authority executive Bill Baroni, were found guilty after Wildstein's testimony implicated Kelly, Baroni, Christie and other key Christie administration figures.

I admit to being a willing participant in a culture that was, upon reflection, disgusting,  he said.  Each of us put our faith and trust in a man that neither earned it or deserved it.  It was Wildstein's willingness to turn over incriminating messages to state legislators that ensured the scheme came to light, Cortes said. Those documents included an infamous email in which Kelly told Wildstein,  Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee,  setting the plot in motion. Kelly, Cortes said, had deleted that email along with others, leaving Wildstein as the only source of crucial information.

From the point of view of the number of participants, this has been a success, and we hope that it consolidates into concrete offers,  Tapia said, adding that the ministry wanted to award the contract before March, when the current government ends.  We think this business opportunity has to do not only with arriving in Chile, but also expanding to other countries throughout the region,  she added. Chile, like neighboring Argentina, is trying to attract private investment to improve its ports, roads and airports, and two major candidates in November's presidential election have also pledged to dramatically expand the nation's transport network. Included in the contract is the replacement of half of the 'Transantiago' transport system - some 3,300 buses - with a more modern, environmentally friendly fleet, including at least 90 electric vehicles. The current system, with long wait times and frequent breakdowns, is widely unpopular, and has become a black eye for the current government of President Michelle Bachelet.

Her small two-room home in a slum in the western Indian city of Ahmedabad would get so hot that she could not sit indoors for several hours in the day, even with a ceiling fan running. Two months ago, however, she agreed to try an experiment: A non-profit organization that works in the Ramesh Dutt Colony where she lives, on the outskirts of the city, painted her tin roof with white reflective paint, to try to reduce the heat. The simple change worked. Through the month of May - usually the hottest time of year with temperatures reaching nearly 45 degree Celsius (113 degrees Farenheit) on many days - Meenaben, who goes by one name, has been able to sit in her home and even work, sewing quilts and bedcovers.  We used to really suffer from the heat. We could not sit inside, we could not work, people were falling sick,  she said.  This year it has been so much better. The paint brought the temperature down by several degrees, and I have been able to sit in my home, do my work,  she said. The reflective paint is an experiment by Ahmedabad-based Mahila Housing Trust (MHT), a non-profit that is teaching women to be more resilient in 100 slums in five cities. The organization, which focuses on upgrading and redeveloping slums and helping women secure property rights, is also helping women deal with climate change pressure, through techniques such as rainwater harvesting and composting.  They work so hard to improve their lives, their homes. But even one setback from something like flash floods or a heatwave can have a big impact and cause them to slip back into poverty,  said Bharati Bhonsale, a program manager at MHT.  A flash flood can destroy their belongings, heat stress affects their work and their health. So it's important they are equipped to manage the effects of climate change,  she said. Extreme Heat Increasingly extreme heat is one of the many effects of climate change in India, where a modest 0.5 degree Celsius rise in average temperatures over the last 50 years has led to a nearly 150 percent hike in heatwaves that kill at least 100 people. The number of recorded deaths due to heatwaves in 2015 – more than 2,400 – was higher than the death toll from any other natural disaster that year, according to government data. Ahmedabad knows first hand the dangers of extreme heat. A major heatwave in 2010 caused more than 1,000 deaths. In 2013, the city adopted a Heat Action Plan that includes a warning system, and works with civil society groups to try to protect the city's most vulnerable people. MHT knows the disproportionate effect of climate change on the city's poorest residents, and is trying to do something about it. It is experimenting with reflective paint, insulated ceilings and modular roofs in homes in Ramesh Dutt Colony. These are low-cost options that can bring down indoor temperatures by several degrees, Bhonsale told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Women are also trained in measures such as using fuel-efficient stoves to reduce reliance on firewood, rainwater harvesting, composting, cleaning stormwater drains and planting shrubs to help prevent flash floods. The trust has installed a warning system in some slums that sounds an alarm during heavy rains, so residents can move documents and food to higher spots in case of flooding, Bhonsale said.  For poor women their home is also their workplace, their storehouse. They are much more sensitized to the impact of climate change, and understand the seriousness of it,  she said. Snakes and Ladders     In Ramesh Dutt Colony, the women have also learned to keep the narrow lanes trash free and look for places where rainwater may collect, to prevent the spread of mosquito-borne diseases such as malaria - another effect of rising temperatures. In teaching women about climate change and its effects, Bhonsale often uses a modified version of the children's board game Snakes and Ladders. Getting a property title or using a solar cooker takes them up a ladder, while losing belongings in a flood or being unable to work because of the heat brings them sliding down on a snake.  They may not understand the science of global warming, but they have first-hand experience of its effects, and with some education and simple solutions, they are better able to tackle it,  Bhonsale said.  They no longer have to say: this is how it is, we can do nothing about it.     Reporting by Rina Chandran @rinachandran, Editing by Laurie Goering.

The report, commissioned in November 2015 by then-Prime Minister David Cameron, was handed to the government last year and ministers have been under pressure to release its findings following three deadly attacks in Britain since March which have been blamed on Islamist militants.  Home Secretary (interior minister) Amber Rudd said that though some extremist Islamist organizations were receiving hundreds of thousands of pounds, she had decided against publishing the review in full.  This is because of the volume of personal information it contains and for national security reasons,  she said in a written statement to parliament. The review found the most common source of support for these organizations was from small, anonymous donations from people based in Britain, according to Rudd. But it also found overseas funding was a significant source of income for a small number of organizations.  Overseas support has allowed individuals to study at institutions that teach deeply conservative forms of Islam and provide highly socially conservative literature and preachers to the UK's Islamic institutions,  Rudd's statement said.  Some of these individuals have since become of extremist concern.  Critics were quick to see a cover-up to shield Saudi Arabia, a powerful Gulf ally of Britain and the world's biggest oil exporter. The Home Office later released a statement denying this.  FILE PHOTO: Britain's Home Secretary, Amber Rudd, arrives in Downing Street for a cabinet meeting, in central London, Britain June 20, 2017.Eddie Keogh Contrary to suggestions by some media outlets, diplomatic relations played absolutely no part in the decision not to publish the full report,  the statement said. Lawmaker Caroline Lucas, co-leader of the Green Party who had been pressing the government to release the report, said Rudd's statement was unacceptable.  The statement gives absolutely no clue as to which countries foreign funding for extremism originates from - leaving the government open to further allegations of refusing to expose the role of Saudi Arabian money in terrorism in the UK,  she said. That view was echoed by the Liberal Democrats and the main opposition Labour party.  There is a strong suspicion this report is being suppressed to protect this government's trade and diplomatic priorities, including in relation to Saudi Arabia,  said Labour's home affairs spokeswoman, Diane Abbott. Britain's Henry Jackson Society (HJS) think tank last week released a report which said foreign funding for Islamist extremism in Britain primarily came from governments and government-linked foundations in the Gulf, as well as Iran.  Foremost among these has been Saudi Arabia, which since the 1960s has sponsored a multimillion dollar effort to export Wahhabi Islam across the Islamic world, including to Muslim communities in the West,  the report said. The Saudi government has demanded the HJS provide evidence for its claims, saying it was committed to fighting terrorism and violent extremism at home and across the world.  If there is a list of names of Saudi individuals or organizations with proven links to UK terrorism, the think tank should present them and Saudi Arabia will deal with them,  Saudi Information Minister Awwad Alawwad said in a statement.

The oldest man in charge held a pistol to the woman's right thigh, ordering her to be quiet as they approached a checkpoint.  After an hour of driving, the men arrived at a spring in the mountains where they beat the woman with sticks and forced her to walk for about a mile before stopping in an orchard.  Please brother, don't kill me, for the sake of Allah,  the woman - who asked to be identified as Lava to protect her identity - said she pleaded with her older brother Jamal on that night about two years ago. But her pleas were ignored and she was forced to the ground, with her hands tied behind her back and her legs bound, while two of her other brothers dug a grave. Lava knew well of the countless stories in the Kurdish press of women whose charred bodies are found in remote areas, suspected victims of so-called  honor  killings when women are strangled, stabbed or set on fire by their relatives and the authorities then notified of a suicide. Once only common in rural areas, women's rights campaigners are concerned the practice of murdering women for what some see as  immoral acts  has also become commonplace, and accepted, in Iraq's cities and towns but the exact numbers are unknown. Anecdotally it seems the numbers are rising despite increased awareness of the crime, educational policies and an expanded school system with campaigners calling for more action by the authorities to stop these murders.   According to the official data from the government this year there were 24 cases of honor killing cases until the end of May,  said Khanim Rahim, director of the women's rights group Asuda for Combating Violence against Women in Iraqi Kurdistan.  But you need to bear in mind that there are cases that are not registered or reported to the authorities.  In February 2015, figures reported from the Kurdistan Health Ministry showed in the last five years over 3,000 women had been killed as a result of domestic violence in the Kurdistan region. Campaigners say the real number is likely to be higher.  Crime and Punishment Lava, whose  crime  was to be seen in the car of a young man after leaving her job at a hotel in Dohuk in February 2015, said  two of her three brothers and a cousin threw her into the newly-dug grave and covered her with soil so only her head stuck out.  You dishonored us. This is your punishment in this world and you should expect worse in the other world,  she said her brother yelled before the men disappeared into the darkness. The Iraq National Youth Survey in 2009 found 68 percent of young men accept the killing of a women for shaming a family. Lava tried unsuccessfully to remove some soil off her chest to relieve the pressure on her lungs but believes she then must have fallen unconscious. She was lucky, however, a rare case of a woman surviving such a murder bid. Her brother-in-law, a respected lawyer, had heard her brothers plotting to kill her and managed to convince her father to reveal the location of her grave.  It was evening of the following day when I saw my older sister coming towards the grave accompanied by her husband and my three brothers,  Lava told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in a cafe in an undisclosed location in the Kurdish region.  I never thought I would come out of that grave alive.  Campaigners say Iraqi law is letting women down by not cracking down on those responsible for killing female relatives. The Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) has taken some measures to protect women who fear for their lives by opening several protection centers and in 2009 launched the High Council of Women's Affairs to promote and protect women's rights.  In 2012, the KRG launched a five-year plan to combat violence against women which it described as an  urgent priority  to remove  violence against women and providing a quiet and a happy life for them in Kurdistan and preserving the stability of the community . Calls for Legal Changes But in Iraq and Jordan,  honor  killings fall in a separate legal category with murderers getting lighter sentencing, although both countries are in the process of reforming the penal code that deals with violence against women. The United Nations Human Rights Office of the High Commissioner called on the Iraqi government in December 2015 to swiftly amend its Criminal Code that permit  honor  as a lawful defense in ciders against women and family members. For while the Kurdistan Region of Iraq has repealed sections of the Criminal Code that permit reasons of honor as mitigation for crimes of violence committed against family members, these provisions remain in force in the Iraqi Criminal Code. The U.S. State Department said in a 2016 report on human rights practices that  honor  killings remain a serious problem throughout Iraq and this provision limited a sentence for murder to a maximum of three years in prison for such crimes. The United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq documented several cases of honor killings. These included the murder in Basra of a 15-year-old girl who was decapitated, her head wrapped in a hijab, and thrown into a garbage can, and the case of a man never jailed after stabbing his 20-year-old daughter to death for dating a fellow university student. Parwa Ali, a woman parliamentarian in Kurdistan who has dealt with a number of  honor  related cases, said the government has not done enough to stop these crimes.  Unfortunately violence against women is deteriorating and most honor related cases are resolved through tribal agreement ... and not at courts,  she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation from Sulaymaniyah. Ali said the problem was complex due to the tribal nature of political parties and their interference in the judicial process to satisfy the tribal electorate as well as a patriarchal and tribal code of behavior for women. She also criticized the special amnesties issued by the KRG presidency which often allow such killers to go free.   We have not seen a killer of a woman serve his full sentence because they often get out under various pretexts,  said Ali who was voted into parliament in 2013. Rezan Sheikh Dler, a member of the Iraq parliament's Women and Children Affairs Committee, said Article 409 still applies in Iraqi penal code and men who kill their wives for  honor  are often sentenced to one year in prison.  As women parliamentarians in the Iraqi parliament we are trying to amend this article but it is not easy and it'll take time,  she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  In Jordan they have similar provisions.   Pakistan's parliament last year passed legislation against  honor killings , removing a loophole in existing law that allowed killers to walk free after being pardoned by family members, after the murder of an outspoken social media star. Her brother was arrested after her death. Although Lava was one of the lucky ones to survive her attempted murder, she does not feel safe. She was not allowed to leave the family house for 18 months after the night she was rescued but in September 2016, one of her brothers asked her to go and work in a hotel. She saw her chance and planned an escape, fleeing earlier this year. Her future is uncertain but she is convinced that she will be killed by her brothers if she does not escape Kurdistan.  I know they will kill me one day but let me breathe freely while I am still alive,  she said.

Ryan Holmes, the 42-year-old founder and CEO of the social-media management platform Hootsuite, had an off-the-grid upbringing that saw him tending to animals instead of web pages. For the latest in Reuters'  Life Lessons  series, Holmes spoke with Reuters about how he transitioned from farm boy to running a company that is said to be at or near  unicorn -level valuation of more than $1 billion. Q: You had a pretty unconventional childhood. Did that give you a unique life perspective? A: Back in the 1970s, my parents left teaching and bought a farm, so that's where I grew up. We were off the grid, with no electricity, a water well and kerosene lamps. We raised goats and chickens and honeybees. That gave me a lot of practical, hands-on life experience - and taught me how to fix things. Q: Who were your biggest influences in getting started in the business world? A: They say that children of entrepreneurs often become entrepreneurs themselves, because the whole process of going into business for yourself has been demystified. My mom was that influence for me. She came from London, and was a world traveler, artist and businesswoman. She helped me set up my first business, a paintball company, when I was only 16. Q: You later dropped out of a college - why was that? A: I wasn't learning a ton that I thought would help me as an entrepreneur. I'm an experiential learner, and the best path for me is just to go out and do it. So I dropped out, started a pizza-by-the-slice restaurant. From that I learned how to set up an operation, and manage it, and be totally involved at all levels. Q: How did you end up in the digital world? A: This was back in 1999 and the internet was taking off, and I decided I wanted to chase that down. So I sold the restaurant, got a top-of-the-line computer, taught myself programming languages like HTML, and learned all about Web presence. From the beginning I was always a bit of a generalist: as a business owner you need to know about a whole lot of different things - and know enough to be dangerous. Q: After Hootsuite became a success, how did you handle your personal wealth? A: With my investment strategy, I tend to be hands-on and not super complex. I have placed some money under management and self-manage some as well. Since I have equity in Hootsuite, I tend to stay away from too many internet stocks, in order to achieve some balance. With my liquid assets, I am pretty middle-of-the-road in my risk tolerance, often with index funds. I also have some real estate properties in my hometown of Vancouver, which has seen pretty incredible growth over the years. There is a ton of foreign investment that drives the real estate market here. Q: What money mistakes have been most humbling for you? A: Some of the hardest lessons have been around growth. We had some business teams that went from zero to $100 million in revenues, which is a huge run. I looked at the bench I had at the time, and it wasn't the right team. Some people had to go. That was super hard. So some of the biggest mistakes have involved keeping people on board for longer than they should have. Sometimes you have to be ruthless about who is on the bus. Q: Where do you direct your philanthropic efforts? A: I am passionate about building a tech ecosystem in Canada. My dream is that I want 100 Hootsuites in Vancouver. We need a whole league of young innovators, so we need to find and accelerate these young entrepreneurs. To do that, Hootsuite donates office space and provides mentorship, and I have personally funded programs like that for a number of years. Q: What would you consider a successful life? A: To have a real legacy, and to create financial independence for a lot of people. So we have to keep leveling up, and - to use a hockey term - figure out where the puck is going. I would love to create something like the 'PayPal Mafia,' an alumni group of entrepreneurs going on to start their own amazing ventures. I want to create the 'Maple Syrup Mafia.'

Nikola Dimitrov was speaking on the sidelines of a summit in Trieste of six non-EU Balkan nations, which had been convened by the EU to nudge them toward greater economic integration but looked set to fall short of hopes for a full customs union. Dimitrov told a forum of civil society organizations that Britain’s departure from the EU in 2019 presented Europe and the Balkans with an opportunity.  The desire of the region to join Europe is an opportunity for Europe to feel attractive,  Dimitrov said.  The region and its readiness to step it up and finish the job is an opportunity for Europe to show it can make a difference and that it can think big and be self-confident.  The six countries – Serbia, Bosnia, Kosovo, Montenegro, Macedonia and Albania – have been frustrated by the slow pace of EU accession. Their joining was put firmly on the backburner by some Western EU states as they grappled with crises of migration, Brexit, populism and eurozone debt.

Guido Bergmann/Courtesy of Bundesregierung/Handout via REUTERSGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel, also attending, said the EU had a duty to move the region  slowly but surely  toward membership, more than 25 years after Yugoslavia unraveled in war.  Political stability in the region means political stability for us, too,  Merkel said.  We know this from experience.  The EU has been pushing for the creation of a common market as a way to encourage development and stability in the region, but Kosovo Foreign Minister Enver Hoxhaj told Reuters that his government had managed to take talk of a customs union off the table. The economy of the former Serbian province relies heavily on customs duties. Instead, the countries will sign up to the creation of a  regional economic cooperation area  that would effectively plug some holes in and build on the Central European Free Trade Area, CEFTA. Hoxhaj said that would  harmonize investment law and investment policies , enhance the free movement of people and deepen digital integration.  What has been offered to us on the table is not what was presented in February 2017,  Hoxhaj said, referring to the last meeting of the countries in Sarajevo, when the EU called strongly for a common market.

An opener was the global threat posed by the successful test of a North Korean ballistic missile and the U.S. response that “war cannot be ruled out.”  Having mooted a global nuclear Armageddon, the bulletin plunged into British national miseries: the results of an investigation, which, said the BBC reporter,  “could scarcely be much worse,” into  police failure to assist victims of harassment; another indictment of police by the survivors of the Grenfell Tower fire for not arresting any of those deemed responsible for the inferno; an expected collapse of the government’s determination to restrict public sector pay rises to 1 percent; yet another alleged police failure, this time to protect Bijan Ebrahimi, an Iranian refugee in the UK murdered after years of racist abuse; the charge that a government report on Saudi sponsorship of terrorism in the UK had been suppressed; news that most students leave university with debts of around 50,000 pounds (about $64,000), which most can never repay.  Sports usually come last in BBC bulletins, and since the UK is quite a sporty country, it’s often cheering. Not on this grim bulletin. Mark Cavendish, one of Britain’s cycling stars, crashed out of the Tour de France. British morale would now seem to depend on Andy Murray winning Wimbledon: a challenge for one whose stellar form has slipped this past year.  MORE FROM REUTERS COMMENTARY Noga Tarnopolsky: Netanyahu's bad call on the Western Wall Bennett Ramberg: How to stop Kim Jong Un using his nukes Anger is now the default position of public reaction. Sometimes, as in the case of Grenfell Tower, it seems justified since the (preliminary) evidence is that the Kensington and Chelsea Council skimped on the quality of the building’s insulation and fire doors. But blaming the police for not yet making arrests in a case which is complex as well as tragic, or pouring vocal contempt, at another meeting, on the judge charged with heading an inquiry into the causes of the fire before he has begun his work, it isn’t.  That the normally-trusted police and judiciary now often bear the brunt of the anger points to a fear which lies beneath the anger. It’s a fear compounded of a deep uncertainty which has settled on British society, a fear that there are vast problems in the world, but they are unsolvable.  These are issues which actually do have solutions, but they checkmate each other. The police could cut corners and charge officials for negligence or worse in the Grenfell Tower fire that took 79 lives - and lose the cases for lack of evidence. Or they could proceed with care, and be branded as negligent themselves by an aroused public and vote-seeking politicians.  The overhanging problems in Britain are Brexit and the rancid politics of blame following last month’s general election. Brexit is a torturous amalgam of vast changes to the treaties which have governed the UK’s legal, political and economic frameworks for over 40 years; domestic politics are spiced with jostling for power within the ruling Conservative Party, whose leader, Theresa May, is gravely weakened by nearly losing an election she should have won in a landslide.    The leaders and officials in Britain’s public service and crucial national institutions overwhelmingly believe that Brexit is a disastrous course. The Bank of England, headed by Canadian economist Mark Carney, loyally follows the government’s line, but is privately concerned that the City of London will lose many of its key institutions and that the economy will decline, when Brexit finally happens  The deepening nervousness of the country could be stanched - at least to a degree - if the government had an opposition that respected the desire of the majority for the Westminster parliament to be sovereign once more. But that isn’t the case.  The far-left Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, defying conventional wisdom that he would crash and burn the party in the June election, instead increased Labour’s vote by adopting a position of pure populism that seemed to appeal to the middle class, young and old. A manifesto whose figures did not add up, a position on Brexit so vague as to be unclassifiable, and a steady charge that the Conservatives were the same old reactionary morons they had always been, helped Labour outperform expectations and solidified Corbyn’s leadership - and another setback to British society.  Britain is presently no country for great leaders. Among the likely contenders to replace May, only Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond shows an understanding of the size of the task before his government and the depth of the abyss which might face an indebted Britain. Hammond, however, is a low-key technocrat who has yet to show he has the stomach for a political fight. As if to cement the woes of the past week, already-low productivity fell by 0.5 percent.    Britain is checkmated. It is one country hoping for the best against 27 EU members that have set an agenda which excludes the UK from the club it has spurned. The EU will deny the UK access to the single market which takes the bulk of its exports.     But if the British government softens its stance and follows the Norwegian route of being out of the EU while still in the single market -and thus open to immigration from the EU member states - it will face a fierce revolt from the Brexiteers. Its only big friend in the world then would be the United States, with a president whose aversion to free trade is one of his few fixed ideas, and who may face a future weakening of his own power to the point where he could not help much, even if he wished to.  For the first time since the 1970s, when Britain was branded the sick man of Europe, the country faces a set of serious, potential crises which it will take great statesmanship to avoid. It does not, at present, appear to have anyone, or any party, which possesses it.

DTAs are in place to try to prevent double taxation and also set ground rules for administrative assistance in tax matters.  Switzerland was waiting to clarify the situation before exchanging further information.  The relevant Swiss and French authorities have now resolved these concerns, the Swiss Federal Tax Administration (FTA) said on Wednesday, without disclosing what issues had been clarified.   They are now in a position to pursue the exchange of information upon request in all pending and future cases effectively,  the FTA said in a statement.  France's budget minister, Gerald Darmanin, welcomed the progress saying  a difference of understanding regarding procedure  had hampered the exchange of information in recent months but that this was now resolved.  Exchanges between the two countries have resumed on this basis and will enable France to conduct the necessary work on investigations underway and those in the future,  the minister said in a statement. Since the financial crisis, cash-strapped governments around the world have clamped down on tax evasion, with authorities investigating Swiss banks in Germany, France and the United States. Switzerland's tradition of banking secrecy has helped to make it the world's biggest offshore financial center, with more than $2 trillion in foreign wealth kept with the country's banks.

The former chairman, Steven Richardson, told jurors in Brooklyn federal court that he met with Shkreli in September 2014 to tell him he was losing the board's support. Richardson said he had recently learned that Shkreli, himself a board member, had set up a system to pay Retrophin employees commissions to encourage them to trade stocks, against the board's instructions. When Richardson asked Shkreli about that at the meeting, Shkreli denied it.  I was stunned,  Richardson said.  As a board member - I'm chairman at the time - he's lying to my face.  Richardson said he and other board members had already discussed moving Shkreli to another role at the company, which Shkreli founded in 2011.  He was excellent at the setup stages, but he didn't really have the experience or the leadership to run a complex, multi-product business,  he said. Richardson also said the board had concerns about Shkreli's use of Twitter. Shkreli's fellow board members told him he was being removed as CEO on Sept. 29, 2014, though they asked him to stay on as a board member and senior advisor, Richardson said. Richardson said Shkreli refused and boasted he would found another company that would be worth a billion dollars before Retrophin was. In the following days, he returned to the Retrophin office and went through computer servers and documents until the company took his access away, Richardson said. Shkreli did indeed go on to start another company, Turing Pharmaceuticals, which made headlines by acquiring a life-saving anti-infection drug and jacking up its price by 5,000 percent in 2015. While the move made Shkreli famous as the  pharma bro,  it has nothing to do with the charges against him. Prosecutors, instead, claim that beginning in 2009, Shkreli hid losses from investors in two hedge funds he ran, MSMB Capital and MSMB Healthcare, and paid them back with money stolen from Retrophin. Richardson testified he invested $400,000 in MSMB, later rolled over into Retrophin. Like other investors, he said he came out ahead, with his investment now worth about $1.9 million.

Calgary's Stampede - a 10-day extravaganza of rodeo, street parties and corporate events - takes place every year in Canada's oil capital, attracting cowboys from all over North America to compete in events with C$100,000 prize pots. Slideshow (16 Images)Organizers of the indigenous relay race demonstration hope the event will become an official part of the rodeo, on par with bull riding, saddle bronc and chuck wagon racing. Known as one of the most exciting and risky types of horse racing, bare back relay involves one rider lapping the track three times on three different horses. Races are won and lost on how quickly and smoothly the rider can leap off one horse and up onto the next without spooking the highly-strung thoroughbreds. The rider relies on three other team members - known as the exchange holder, backholder and mugger - keeping the horses calm.     The Carlson Relay team from Browning, Montana, part of the Blackfeet tribe, galloped to first place after two nimble changeovers from rider Chazz Racine, 29. All four teams invited to take part are among the top relay racers in the United States and Canada, where the sport is growing rapidly in popularity, especially among indigenous youth.  Hopefully some other natives will see this and it will get them into it,  Racine said, speaking next to the rodeo ground's horse pens before the race.  It can open doors for you.

About 20,000 police struggled to contain several hundred anti-capitalist militants who torched cars, looted shops and hurled Molotov cocktails and stones during the July 7-8 summit. Tens of thousands more people demonstrated peacefully. Scholz, a senior Social Democrat who had been seen as a potential future party leader before the summit violence, said it had not been possible to ensure security everywhere in the city at all times during the summit, adding:  For what happened, I apologize to the people of Hamburg.  Hamburg's dense, urban environment allowed the 1,000 hard-left militants who wreaked havoc on the city's streets to disperse and hide easily. Scholz, who has faced calls for his resignation from members of Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives in Hamburg, blamed the violence on a 'criminal mob', which he said wanted to injure and kill people.  I am pleased nobody died,  he said. Overall, 476 police officers suffered injuries ranging from cuts and firework burns to eye damage from laser pointers. Police said on Sunday they had arrested 186 people and taken 225 into custody.

The law, which drew cross-party support, removes words including as  husband ,  wife ,  mother  and  father  from the Marriage Act and replaces them with the gender-neutral  spouse ,  parent who gave birth  and  parent who did not give birth . Muscat said such wording was needed to avoid categorizing any member of society. He rejected accusations that this could spell the end to  Mother's Day  or  Father's Day , saying such suggestions were  laughable .  I think this is an historic vote. It shows that our democracy and our society are maturing ... It is a society where we can all say we are equal,  the prime minister told reporters. Muscat won a second term in office on June 3 and had vowed to reinforce his call for equality in society. Once a staunchly conservative nation, Malta has been steadily adopting more progressive legislation in recent years.

Still, nearly $5.1 billion moved into world stock funds and $6.1 billion pivoted into taxable bond funds, marking a 31st straight week of inflows for both categories, according to ICI.

The speaker, Rodrigo Maia, would replace Temer if Congress allows the Supreme Court to move ahead with a corruption charge against the president, a vote that Maia has said he wants to have this week. The bill, a business-friendly measure modernizing labor laws dating from the 1940s, passed by a wide margin in the Senate on Tuesday following approval in the lower house and will be sent to Temer to be signed into law. Given that any changes in the Senate would have sent the bill back to the lower house for fresh debate, Temer assured senators on Tuesday that he would use a decree to tweak the legislation as they suggested after he signs it into law. Maia rejected any such arrangement.  The lower house will not accept any change to the law. Any (presidential decree) will not be recognized by the House,  the speaker said in a Twitter post shortly after midnight. Prosecutors charged Temer last month in a graft scheme involving JBS SA, the world's biggest meatpacker. Executives said the president took bribes from the company in exchange for resolving tax matters and facilitating loans from state-run banks. Temer has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. The presidential press office said in a statement that Maia has remained loyal to Temer since becoming speaker last year.  The presidential palace rebuffs the attempts to create a false crisis between the Executive and Legislative power without connection to facts and reality,  the statement said. Under Brazilian law, two-thirds of the lower house of Congress must vote to allow a criminal charge against a sitting president to move to the Supreme Court. The vote could happen Friday or possibly be delayed until early August, after a congressional recess.

The Briton said there would be no return to the raucous, normally-aspirated V12 engines of old but the sport hoped to bring back some of the key qualities of the past.  Hybrid technology is probably going to be retained because it offers some relevance, and the engagement of manufacturers,  Brawn told reporters at a round table briefing organized by F1 connectivity partner Tata Communications.  But can we turn it round a little bit and make it a tactical quality so that in the race you’ve got much more capacity to use the battery power and the hybrid power to try and get an advantage?.  Brawn cited the example of Mercedes' Valtteri Bottas who passed the Williams of Canadian rookie Lance Stroll for second place at the finish in Azerbaijan last month after saving up battery power and then using it to maximum effect. He said the new engine needed to be  more exciting and accessible  and  probably not such a major performance differentiator . Champions Mercedes, the team Brawn once led after winning both titles with his own Brawn GP team in 2009, have been dominant and won 56 of 68 races since the start of the 2014 season. The new power unit under discussion with current manufacturers and others would be the first since the V6 turbo hybrid era replaced the normally-aspirated V8s in 2014. Brawn warned it would not satisfy everyone.  It’s not a question of finding a sort of middle ground where you don’t offend anyone because I don’t think that would be the best solution,  he said. After he spoke, cars from Formula One's past and present -- some from the 1980s with V12 engines -- did demonstration runs in London's central Trafalgar Square as part of an F1 Live event ahead of this weekend's British Grand Prix. Brawn said fans who wanted to go back to the normally aspirated engines did so because they missed the emotion, noise and revs.  So can we create a hybrid engine that has that noise and the revs and the appeal?,  he added.  I think the manufacturers involved in Formula One know that’s the key element, because they need to have a successful Formula One.  It’s no good having an engineering exercise that demonstrates your technology if nobody’s watching.

In what may be one of her last appearances before Congress, Yellen depicted an economy that, while growing slowly, continued to add jobs, benefited from steady household consumption and a recent jump in business investment, and was now being supported  by stronger economic conditions abroad. The Fed  continues to expect that the evolution of the economy will warrant gradual increases in the federal funds rate over time,  Yellen said in her prepared testimony. Reductions in the Fed's portfolio of more than $4 trillion in securities are likely to begin  this year,  she said. But she also noted that given current estimates, the federal funds rate  would not have to rise all that much further  to reach a neutral level that neither encourages nor discourages economic activity. The Fed still feels the economy needs loose, or accommodative, monetary policy, so a lower neutral rate means the Fed may feel compelled to slow the pace of rate hikes down the road.  But for now, Yellen told members of the House Committee on Financial Services, the economy remains strong enough for the Fed to continue to gradually tighten policy. In response to questions from lawmakers, she said she expects the gradual run down of the balance sheet will  play out smoothly  in markets. The reduction in the balance sheet, which will begin slowly as the Fed reinvests only a portion of the holdings that mature each month, will mark the final exit from crisis-related policies. Related CoverageCoast to coast, Fed sees 'slight to moderate' and 'modest to moderate' economyInstant View: Yellen - Economy healthy enough for gradual rate risesEconomy on Even Keel Yellen's past appearances before the House panel have sometimes involved sharp exchanges with lawmakers who think the Fed's influence over the economy has grown too strong. Such lawmakers want policymakers to be guided more closely by a mathematical rule for setting interest rates.  This session was a more sedate meeting, with Committee Chair Jeb Hensarling, an advocate  rules-based  monetary policy, complimenting the Fed for including comparisons of its monetary policy with some of the more common formulas.  The Federal Reserve Board Chairwoman Janet Yellen testifies before a House Financial Services Committee hearing covering monetary policy on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., July 12, 2017.Aaron P. BernsteinHer appearance, coming as the Trump administration mulls whether to replace her when her term ends in February, broke little new ground in terms of policy or regulatory changes.  We have a relatively light regulatory agenda at this point,  Yellen said. She confirmed the Fed was reviewing some of the requirements imposed on bank boards of directors following the financial crisis, with any eye toward possibly easing some of them. She also repeated the Fed's strong opposition to proposals that policymakers worry could give elected officials influence over what are supposed to be independent Fed interest rate decisions. Slideshow (2 Images)According to her testimony the economy is on an even keel, near or beyond full employment.  U.S. stocks rose, while yields on Treasury bonds fell and the dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies.  In a separate release, the Fed's latest beige book of reports from regional Fed banks showed  slight to moderate  economic growth across the country. A recent dip in inflation has been of concern among Fed officials who want to see surer progress toward the central bank's 2 percent inflation goal. Yellen, however, ascribed it to  a few unusual reductions in certain categories of prices  that would eventually drop out of the calculation.  The current situation  raises the stakes  for upcoming inflation data, said Jim Vogel, interest rate strategist for FTN Financial in Memphis, Tennessee.  People are going to be very anxious if that was just a statistical glitch...or if it is going to continue.  Otherwise, Yellen said, the economy appeared to be in a virtuous loop of hiring, spending and investment that  should increase resource utilization somewhat further, thereby fostering a stronger pace of wage and price increases.

The defending champion was beaten 3-6 6-4 6-7(4) 6-1 6-1 by the giant American, who fought hard to stay in the match before cutting loose as the world number one became increasingly immobile.  The Briton came into the tournament under a cloud, facing questions about his fitness after a first-round exit at the grasscourt warm-up event at Queen's.   He came through his first four matches at the all England Club relatively unscathed, although his movement around the court never looked truly comfortable.  Against Querrey, however, he was clearly in pain and lost the final two sets in less than 47 minutes.  The whole tournament I've been a little bit sore. But I tried my best right to the end and gave everything I had. I'm proud about that,  Murray told reporters.   But it's obviously disappointing to lose at Wimbledon. There's obviously an opportunity there. So I'm sad that it's over.  Murray said he would analyze his options to decide on the best form of rehabilitation, but would not be drawn into any hasty decisions.  Miles Maclagan, who was previously part of Murray's coaching team, told the BBC he should look at Roger Federer and how he benefited from taking an extended break from the game.  Federer missed the entire claycourt season in order to prepare for Wimbledon and has sauntered into the semi-finals without losing a set.  Murray did not dismiss the idea outright following defeat by Querrey.   I don't know. It depends,  he said when asked if he would benefit from a longer break.   I'll get the best advice I can, then stick with that. If it means taking a few weeks' rest, then so be it. If it means training and doing the right rehab and stuff, then I'll do that.

The initiative by 227 cities and counties, nine states and more than 1,500 businesses, including Fortune 500 companies, was announced in a statement by California Governor Jerry Brown and Michael Bloomberg, a former New York mayor.  Today we're sending a clear message to the world that America's states, cities and businesses are moving forward with our country's commitments under the Paris Agreement - with or without Washington,  said Brown in a statement.  America's Pledge , as the plan has been dubbed, comes a month after the White House announced it was leaving the 2015 Paris accord agreed by nearly 200 countries to curb climate-warming greenhouse gas emissions. That decision was met with dismay across the world while prompting state governors and city mayors to say they would collectively show their country still remained committed to cutting emissions that scientists blame for global warming. In a growing movement, cities, states and companies have since endorsed various statements promising to step up efforts to slow climate change.  The American government may have pulled out of the Paris Agreement, but American society remains committed to it - and we will redouble our efforts to achieve its goals,  said Bloomberg in a statement. Outside experts with the World Resources Institute and the Rocky Mountain Institute, two U.S.-based non-profits, have been retained to conduct the study on current and projected emissions of  America's Pledge  affiliates. The initiative hopes to present their findings to the United Nations at a Bonn, Germany, climate meeting in November. Under the Paris deal, former President Barack Obama's administration had vowed to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 26 percent to 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025. But in abandoning the accord, Trump said the federal government would not honor those pledges, which were non-binding. Still, last month in an effort to fill a climate leadership void, Bloomberg, a U.N. envoy on cities and climate change, committed $200 million to support city initiatives including projects to combat global warming through a grant program called the American Cities Initiative. Bloomberg Philanthropies has also committed to separately fund America's Pledge, Antha Williams, a spokeswoman for the group told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in a phone interview. The United Nations' chief, António Guterres, said in a statement he  welcome[d]  the plan to assess how U.S. cities, states and others are contributing to slashing global greenhouse gas emissions.  This is demonstrably not an issue that can be addressed by national governments alone,  he said.

The law, which drew cross-party support, removes words including as  husband ,  wife ,  mother  and  father  from the Marriage Act and replaces them with the gender-neutral  spouse ,  parent who gave birth  and  parent who did not give birth . Muscat said such wording was needed to avoid categorising any member of society. He rejected accusations that this could spell the end to  Mother's Day  or  Father's Day , saying such suggestions were  laughable . Muscat won a second term in office on June 3 and had vowed to reinforce his call for equality in society. Once a staunchly conservative nation, Malta has been steadily adopting more progressive legislation in recent years. In 2011, the country voted in a referendum to allow divorce, and in 2014 it approved civil partnerships. Malta was the 24th country in the world to legalise same-sex marriage with Tuesday's vote coming just two weeks after German lawmakers approved a similar measure in June. The opposition Nationalist Party backed the introduction of same-sex marriage, despite fierce criticism from some conservatives, who said it marked a damaging departure from the party's Christian-Democratic principles.  You have pushed the party into a lose-lose situation and it seems many of you cannot even see it,  said former finance minister Tonio Fenech, who is no longer a member of parliament. In the end, only one opposition lawmaker voted against the bill, while 66 parliamentarians supported it. There were no abstentions. Opposition leader Simon Busuttil said his party backed the law because society was changing and because it did not alter anything from the civil partnerships law which gave civil partners the same rights as married couples. The Malta Gay Rights Movement celebrated the new law with a party attended by hundreds in a square outside the prime minister's office in the capital, Valletta.

Blumenthal told reporters on Capitol Hill that he requested the meeting with Makan Delrahim in the wake of a New York Times report that White House advisers battling television news station CNN mulled using a government review of AT&T;'s merger plans as leverage. Delrahim was nominated to be the assistant attorney general for antitrust at the Justice Department and is awaiting Senate confirmation.

(Reuters) - An attorney for Elliott Management on Wednesday complained to a bankruptcy court judge that the owner of Texas's largest power distribution business did not provide the investment fund with information needed to line up financing for its offer of more than $18 billion to buy the company. Instead, Energy Future Holdings Corp, the bankrupt majority owner of Oncor Electric Delivery Co, struck a deal this month to sell its ownership of the business to Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) for $9 billion in cash, valuing the company at $18.1 billion.  A lawyer for Elliott Management, which spent years battling Argentina over its defaulted debt, told the court that the fund has enough debt in Oncor's parent, Energy Future, to block the Berkshire deal.  The fund has argued that its own $18.5 billion Oncor deal would be better for creditors. Gregg Galardi, Elliott's lawyer, said potential sources of financing for a rival bid had contacted Elliott, a $32 billion fund led by billionaire Paul Singer, but Energy Future had ignored requests for information to help structure a deal.  We need actual cooperation,  he said. Galardi also noted that Energy Future had not run an auction. Chad Husnick, who represents Energy Future, countered that Elliott had not signed a non-disclosure agreement with Oncor and said Energy Future would not shop its Oncor stake when Elliott had no committed financing.  My response is, show me the money and we’ll consider it,  he said. Husnick also told the hearing in Wilmington, Delaware, that the Berkshire plan could be confirmed. Two previous deals for Oncor, with Hunt Consolidated Inc and another with NextEra Energy (NEE.N), were rejected by Texas's Public Utility Commission after the plans were confirmed by the bankruptcy court. Husnick said the Berkshire proposal has already been discussed with PUC staff. He said Energy Future anticipates quick regulatory approval and then confirmation of the plan by the bankruptcy court, an approach that Judge Christopher Sontchi said he supported. Elliott has estimated creditors will be repaid around 24 cents on the dollar under the Berkshire proposal, compared to 80 cents under the deal NextEra Energy that was blocked by Texas regulators. A hearing on the schedule for reviewing the Berkshire plan was set for July 26. Energy Future has been in bankruptcy since 2014, filing after a consortium of private equity firms bought it for about $44 billion.

Fed policymakers last month agreed on a basic plan for reducing the balance sheet, built up over years of bond purchases in an effort to reduce long-term borrowing costs and spur investment after the 2007-2009 financial crisis. They remain split on exactly when to start those reductions. Some like are George pushing for doing so soon in order to limit the possibility of an asset bubble or other distortion that could ultimately spark another crisis or recession.  Holding long-term rates below the level that they might otherwise move to naturally, amidst improving economic fundamentals, risks creating financial imbalances,  George said in remarks prepared for delivery at a Kansas City Fed economic forum in Denver, Colo.  While the Fed has raised short-term interest rates two times this year and expects to do so again before the end of the year, longer-term rates have not risen much in response. A narrow gap between short-term and long-term borrowing costs can distort investment decisions, George said; shrinking the balance sheet could allow long-term rates to rise gradually.   Current asset valuations and low implied volatility in stock and bond markets may be signaling investor complacency, she said.   The failure of longer-term rates to move up with short-term rates during this normalization cycle illustrates the risk for a disruptive repricing of assets as markets adjust to a more normal policy stance,  George warned, adding that such potential for disruption underscores the need to make sure that the largest U.S. banks are well-capitalized and able to withstand a financial shock.

By Andrew Osborn and Olga Sichkar MOSCOW (Reuters) - A Moscow court convicted one of Russia's most flamboyant tycoons, Sergei Polonsky, of fraud on Wednesday, and yet the property developer who symbolized the excess of the oil-fueled boom times walked away a free man. The presiding judge, who had just sentenced Polonsky to five years in prison in one breath, ordered his release in the next, saying too much time had elapsed since his crime for the sentence to have legal force. Polonsky, 44, staged antics during his career ranging from a hunger strike to eating part of his tie on live TV. However, they failed to endear him with Russians left behind by the boom during President Vladimir Putin's first two terms in office and who are now struggling following a sharp economic slowdown. Vedomosti, a business daily, quoted him as saying in 2008 that anyone who did not have a billion dollars could  fuck off . Polonsky - a former occupant of the Forbes rich list with a fortune of $1.2 billion - disputes the accuracy of the quote. Nevertheless, it went viral as the global financial crisis was about to hit Russia and many ordinary people remember it with bitterness to this day. The conviction, despite his unexpected release, appears to mark the end of an era in Russian business when displays of fabulous riches were common and tycoons were self-made through wheeling and dealing. That has been replaced by a more sober atmosphere where the Kremlin frowns on the flaunting of wealth and only Kremlin-connected tycoons make the biggest fortunes. Polonsky has spent the last five years fighting the fraud allegations and more than two years in pre-trial detention in Moscow. He says his fate is a cautionary tale about the risks of doing business in Russia today. Making money is closely tied up with fickle and often corrupt political connections and business partners routinely betray one another, stealing and cheating their way to huge wealth, he alleged in court.                   It's civil war,  he told the judge in his final address.  How can we do business if we are destroying one another? The situation is close to catastrophic with the Russian economy.   Polonsky's legal problems began in 2012 when state prosecutors accused his firm of stealing more than 5.7 billion roubles (now $94 million) of prepayments for flats in an unfinished Moscow complex it was building. Polonsky indicated in court that state prosecutors had later revised that sum downwards to under 3 billion roubles.   The fallen tycoon, who at 1.93 meters (6 feet 4 inches) towers over most people, denied wrongdoing. He said the funds were taken in good faith, that many of the apartments had been delivered, but that the global crisis had made it impossible to hand over others on time. He alleged that business partners, keen to steal his firm, had helped to organize charges against him. They had encouraged scores of buyers who did not get their homes on time to cooperate with investigators, even though he was working with them to try to find a solution, Polonsky said. Russian real estate tycoon Sergei Polonsky (C), who was found guilty of fraud and then released, addresses journalists outside a court building in Moscow, Russia July 12, 2017.Maxim ShemetovThe judge sided with state prosecutors, however, and only the statute of limitations saved Polonsky from more prison time.    Forbes List to Jail  Polonsky, originally from St Petersburg, found success as a  young man, thriving in the anarchic 1990s that followed the fall of the Soviet Union. He and a friend started small, buying up unfinished apartments, doing them up, and selling them for a higher price. They soon graduated to entire buildings and built one of the city's early business centers.  Polonsky opened an office in Moscow in 2000 but he and his friend later split the business. Polonsky took sole control of the Moscow firm, which he called Mirax Group, and his friend the St Petersburg operation. Slideshow (6 Images)Mirax flourished, embarking on projects in the United States, Britain, Turkey and Ukraine among others. Back at home, it started building the Federation Tower, billed as the Russian capital's first skyscraper and the tallest building in Europe. In 2008, when Polonsky was 35 years old, Forbes magazine  estimated his wealth at $1.2 billion. Mirax was hit hard by the crisis of that same year, when demand for the swish apartments and town houses it specialized in building slumped, leaving the firm overstretched and mired in debt. It struggled to raise fresh capital. In October that year, Polonsky pledged to eat his tie if prices for elite apartments did not rise by a quarter in a year and a half. They didn't and Polonsky stuck to his promise. Mirax staggered on even as creditors called in its debts,  securing a loan of almost $400 million from a state lender. Polonsky liquidated the brand and renamed the firm. The crisis affected a residential complex Polonsky had taken on at the request of the Moscow authorities after the company he was working with on the project terminated the contract, citing Mirax's funding problems. Polonsky, in protest, declared the hunger strike and took up round-the-clock residence in a tent on the construction site.  In June 2013, the Interior Ministry charged him with embezzlement, saying he had taken 5.78 billion roubles in downpayments from people wanting to buy flats at the site that they never received. The funds had been illegally diverted to other Mirax entities, investigators said.  Polonsky, who at the time was in Cambodia where he also had real estate interests, denied wrongdoing. He spent time in a Cambodian prison after being accused of briefly kidnapping six Cambodian sailors in a New Year's Eve celebration gone wrong. In May 2015, he was deported to Moscow. Sporting long hair and a beard outside the court on Wednesday, Polonsky told reporters he had  something to say  about the verdict but would be devoting his first seven days of freedom to his wife.  When asked what his wider plans were, he replied:  To turn the world upside down.      Editing by David Stamp","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-court-polonsky-idUSKBN19X1MZ"},

A defense ministry spokesman told Reuters that development of new  aviation cyber expertise  would cover everything from raising consciousness about cyber threats to technical research projects and equipping aircraft with protective systems. State Secretary Katrin Suder had backed the idea, which Major General Ansgar Rieks, head of the German Military Aviation Authority, proposed in a letter in June, the spokesman said. Rieks said last week that he was unnerved by a demonstration by the government-funded German Aerospace Center (DLR) in Bavaria showing hackers could take control of an aircraft with inexpensive equipment.  That frightens me. I wrote to the state secretary about it and said doing nothing would amount to gross negligence,  he said at a talk at a conference in Bueckeburg, Germany. He said the issue was also a vital concern for civil aviation.   He said military officials needed to focus not just on potential problems with computer software, but should also work to  ensure that airplanes cannot be taken over from the ground, or possibly by a passenger in the air . A spokesman for the DLR, which has studied aviation cyber security extensively, had no immediate comment on the issue. Germany's military this year launched a new cyber command that groups cyber units from across the military, which will also involved in the new aviation cyber initiative. Cyber resilience - making sure that systems can survive a cyber attack and keep functioning - was a major topic during a conference at Bundeswehr University Munich last month, the DLR spokesman said. Germany's military is also working on the aviation cyber issue within the European Union and NATO, he said. Concerns about cyber attacks on aircraft and in the broader aviation sector have grown sharply in recent years with a growing barrage of attacks and breaches against other sectors. Many experts fear that the aviation industry has not kept pace with the threat hackers pose to increasingly computer-connected airplanes.  Rapid adoption of communication protocols similar to those used on the internet to connect cockpits, cabins and ground controls, have left air traffic open to vulnerabilities bedevilling other sectors such as finance and oil and gas.

The move makes Guitar Center the latest example of a brick-and-mortar retailer facing financial distress, as its stores are relegated to showrooms by consumers looking for bargains on the internet and in big box retailers such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N). In addition to Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), musicians can now buy their instruments online from Sweetwater Sound Inc, as well as directly from guitar makers themselves, such as Fender Musical Instruments. Guitar Center, majority-owned by private equity firm Ares Management LP (ARES.N), has been having conversations with investment banks and law firms about hiring advisers to help address its capital structure, with $615 million in secured debt coming due in 2019, the people said this week.  The sources asked not to be identified because the company's plans to cut its debt have not been made public. Ares declined to comment.  The musical instrument industry grew 9 percent to $7.1 billion in retail sales over the past five years, but remains well below its 2005 peak of $7.7 billion, according to data from The Music Trades magazine. The industry's challenges have been compounded as the newest generation of teens has shifted its focus from guitars to consoles, smartphones and sports. The electric guitar has been virtually absent from the Top 20 music charts in the past five years. Based in Westlake Village, California, Guitar Center has more than 280 stores across the United States. Its sister brand Music & Arts runs 150 stores focused on band and orchestral equipment for schools and educators.  It has sought to draw shoppers into its stores by offering music lessons, instrument rentals and free workshops. Guitar Center began in 1959 as a store selling home organs in Hollywood. In the 1980s, the company started its Rockwalk on Sunset Boulevard, a hall of fame that pays homage to musicians including Alanis Morissette, Aerosmith and Van Halen.  After a period of explosive growth, it went public in the 1990s.     Guitar Center's debt is trading at a significant discount to its face value. Its $325 million in unsecured bonds due in 2020 are trading at about 59 cents on the dollar, according to Thomson Reuters data. The company's $615 million in secured bonds due in 2019 are trading at about 87 cents on the dollar.  Credit ratings agency Moody's Investors Service Inc said in April that it did not expect that Guitar Center will generate enough free cash flow in the next 12 to 18 months to materially reduce its debt and improve leverage. This would not be the first time Guitar Center would undergo a debt restructuring. In 2014, Ares, which was the company's creditor at the time, swapped its debt in the retailer for a controlling equity stake, cutting the retailer's debt by about $500 million.

Nigeria, Africa's biggest economy, is in the second year of a recession caused by low crude oil prices and attacks by militants on facilities in its Niger Delta energy hub. Oil sales account for 70 percent of government revenues. Several states around the country raised money on the domestic bond market and from banks to fund infrastructure projects at the peak of oil prices. But as crude prices plunged many have found themselves unable to pay bills or salaries. A total of 2.7 trillion naira is outstanding, Finance Minister Kemi Adeosun told reporters in the capital, Abuja, after a cabinet meeting. Money is owed to state governments, contractors and oil marketers, she said, as well as power generation and distribution companies. Some 740 billion naira of pension and salary arrears and 1.93 trillion naira of other obligations are also outstanding, including to federal government contractors and suppliers. Adeosun said the programme required final approval from parliament.

We are going to have a bilateral meeting with the Austrian economy ministry. I think this meeting will take place this month,  he told reporters. Austria's ministry of economics said it had received no official request from Turkey, and had learned about Zeybekci's plan only via the media.   But, of course, we are generally interested in bilateral talks,  a ministry spokesman said on Wednesday.  The Alpine republic said on Monday Zeybekci could not visit Vienna to attend a gathering of Turks in Austria to mark the crushing of the coup attempt. Austria has been one of the most vocal critics in the European Union of Turkey's security crackdown since the failed coup last July, and has said it will not allow the Turkish government to exert political influence on its territory.      Since the coup, in which more than 240 people were killed, Turkey has jailed more than 50,000 people pending trial and suspended or dismissed some 150,000 over alleged links with the exiled Muslim cleric Ankara blames for the coup. Turkey says the crackdown is necessary due to the security threats it faces. It said the block on its economy minister entering the country for the anniversary showed Vienna was not sincere in protecting democratic values.   If there is a new request we will evaluate it again,  a spokesman for Austria's foreign ministry said on Wednesday of  Zeybekci's comments. He added that while bilateral meetings were always possible, Vienna would not support major events  that bring foreign conflicts to Austria . Zeybekci said Austria was an  important economic partner for Turkey .  The two countries should always be involved in a dialogue,  the minister added. The Turkish ambassador returned to Austria only days ago, after being recalled to Ankara nearly a year ago. His return had been seen as a sign of easing in the relations between the two countries.

Trump Jr. released a series of emails on Tuesday that revealed he had eagerly agreed to meet a woman he was told was a Russian government lawyer who might have damaging information about Democratic rival Hillary Clinton as part of Moscow's official support for his father. Trump Jr., in a Fox News television interview Tuesday, said:  In retrospect, I probably would have done things a little differently.   The president, after initially releasing a statement calling his son  high-quality,  on Wednesday praised the TV appearance and again condemned news coverage and investigations into his campaign's alleged links to Russia.  He was open, transparent and innocent. This is the greatest Witch Hunt in political history. Sad!  Trump wrote on Twitter. Christopher Wray, Trump's nominee to lead the Federal Bureau of Investigation, told a U.S. Senate confirmation hearing on Wednesday he did not consider special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian meddling to be a  witch hunt.  The emails offered the most concrete evidence to date that Trump campaign officials embraced an offer of Russian help to win the election, a subject that has cast a cloud over Trump's presidency and spurred multiple investigations. Related CoverageU.S. Senate Judiciary chairman to call ex-Trump aide Manafort to testifyRussia's Lavrov: show me at least one fact Moscow meddled in U.S. electionKremlin 'has nothing to do' with Russian lawyer who contacted Trump's teamThe emails do not appear to provide evidence of illegal activity, but legal experts say Trump Jr. could run into trouble if investigators find he aided a criminal action, such as hacking into Democratic computer networks, or violated campaign-finance laws by accepting gifts from foreign entities.   U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded Moscow sought to help Trump win the election, in part by releasing private emails from Democratic Party officials.            The Justice Department and Congress are both investigating alleged Russian interference in the election and possible collusion with Trump's campaign.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Wednesday it was preposterous that Trump's eldest son was under attack for meeting the Russian lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya.  I learned with surprise that a Russian lawyer, a woman, is being blamed and Trump's son is being blamed for meeting. For me, this is wild,  Lavrov told a news conference in Brussels.          Slideshow (3 Images)'Functioning Perfectly' The allegations that Russia tried to help Trump win the election has cast a cloud over his presidency. White House aides say the president keenly watches cable TV news, which he often mentions in his tweets. Trump denied that on Wednesday, saying the White House was focused on getting healthcare and tax reforms through Congress.  The W.H. is functioning perfectly, focused on HealthCare, Tax Cuts/Reform & many other things. I have very little time for watching T.V.,  Trump wrote on Twitter.  One of the president's personal attorneys, Jay Sekulow, in a series of TV interviews on Wednesday said Trump Jr.'s meeting with Veselnitskaya was not a violation of the law and that the president was unaware of the meeting and the emails until recently.   There's no illegality,  he told NBC's  Today  program.      Trump Jr. said that Paul Manafort, Trump's campaign manager at the time, and son-in-law Jared Kushner, now a top White House adviser, also attended the meeting with Veselnitskaya, who has denied having Kremlin ties.

The future of Gibraltar, a rocky enclave on the southern tip of Spain captured by Britain in 1704, and its 30,000 inhabitants is set to be a major point of contention in Brexit negotiations. Addressing members of both houses of parliament during the first Spanish state visit to Britain in 31 years, Felipe said both countries had overcome  estrangements, rivalries and disputes  in the past.   I am certain this resolve to overcome our differences will be even greater in the case of Gibraltar, and I am confident that through the necessary dialogue and effort, our two governments will be able to work toward arrangements that are acceptable to all involved,  he said. The EU annoyed Britain and Gibraltar in April by suggesting Spain has a right of veto over the territory's post-Brexit relationship with the bloc. Spain's King Felipe is greeted by Britain's Queen Elizabeth during a ceremonial welcome on Horse Guards Parade, in central London, Britain July 12, 2017.Matt Dunham/PoolGibraltar voted strongly in favor of remaining in the EU at last year's Brexit referendum but remains committed to staying part of Britain and has said it is preparing to lose its preferential access to the EU markets. The subject is likely to come up when Felipe, who used a speech to the United Nations last year to invite Britain  to end the colonial anachronism of Gibraltar , holds a bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Theresa May on Thursday. Slideshow (10 Images)The pair, who will meet at May's Downing Street residence on the second day of the three-day, pomp-laden state visit, are also likely to discuss the issue of EU citizen's rights post-Brexit.  The EU and Britain have yet to agree on guarantees for EU citizens living in Britain and British expats living in other EU countries. More than 300,000 Britons live in Spain, while more than 130,000 Spaniards live in Britain. Felipe told members of parliament on these citizens had  a legitimate expectation of decent and stable living conditions .

The Lebanese army escorted around 250 people out of the border town of Arsal. The refugees headed for the Syrian town of Asal al-Ward across the border, northeast of Damascus. A military media unit run by Damascus ally Hezbollah said the buses carried 60 families. An estimated 60,000 refugees are in Arsal. It was the second batch of people to leave  for their hometown across the border Arsal under the agreement, which Hezbollah arranged in indirect talks with the Syrian rebel group Saraya Ahl al-Sham, said an official in the alliance fighting in support of the Damascus government. Hezbollah also coordinated with the Lebanese military and with the Syrian government separately, securing crossings for refugees who want to leave, the official said.  Several refugees told a Reuters photographer before a checkpoint manned by Hezbollah fighters they were eager to go back to their hometown after several years in squalid, makeshift camps in the border town of Arsal.  It's been three years and we haven't seen our families and relatives, said Abeer Mahmoud al Haj, in a van with her family members around her.  May God return everyone to his country, there is no better than Syria,    Since early in the Syrian conflict, Hezbollah has backed Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government, along with Iran and Russia, sending thousands of men to fight the mostly Sunni Syrian rebels. The U.N. refugee body said it was not involved in the deal. A spokeswoman said it was not encouraging large-scale return of refugees to a country where conflict is still raging.  The UNHCR is not at a stage where it's promoting return because the conditions are not conducive,  Dana Sleiman said. Hezbollah member seen at Lebanon's border region of Arsal, Lebanon July 12, 2017.Hassan AbdallahTwo refugees in Arsal who refused to give their names said many in the camps were unwilling to return because of fears their young men would be drafted into the army. Many had also lost their livelihoods and their villages had been ransacked.    Reconciliation Deals  More than 1 million registered Syrian refugees have fled to Lebanon, now making up a quarter of its population, the United Nations refugee agency says. The number is widely put at closer to 1.5 million. They are scattered across Lebanon, mostly in makeshift camps and often in severe poverty, and face the risk of arrest because of restrictions on legal residence and work. Slideshow (5 Images)The group of refugees returned on Wednesday as part of a local deal, not a broader agreement. Politicians are deeply divided over whether Lebanon should work directly with the Syrian government over the return of refugees, which Hezbollah and its allies advocate.  Others, including Lebanese Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri, are strongly opposed, questioning the safety of the refugees once they return. Hariri has called for secure areas to be set up on the Syrian side of the border to which refugees could voluntarily return under United Nations supervision.  In a televised speech on Tuesday, Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah warned that time was running out for Syrian militants along the border near Arsal to reach deals with Syrian authorities.  It's high time to end the threat of militant groups in Arsal and little time is left to reach certain reconciliation deals,  Nasrallah said.  There are terrorists and planners of attacks in Arsal and this needs a solution.  Nasrallah praised the security campaign the Lebanese army has been waging in recent weeks against suspected militants.  The Lebanese army says it regularly stages operations in the hills near the northeastern border against Islamic State and militants formerly linked to al Qaeda.  In late June, authorities arrested several hundred people in raids on Syrian refugee camps in Arsal. A Lebanese military prosecutor has ordered forensic examinations on the bodies of four of them who died in army custody, after rights groups called for an investigation.

Referring to so-called sanctuary cities, Sessions said one problem is the refusal of 300 U.S. jurisdictions to hand over illegal immigrants who commit crimes to federal immigration authorities.  These jurisdictions are protecting criminals rather than their law-abiding residents,  he said. Sessions noted the U.S. murder rate had risen 10 percent nationwide in just one year, marking the largest increase since 1968. The increase was from 2014 to 2015, the latest figures available. Murder and crime rates generally in the United States have fallen over the last several decades.

(Reuters) - An attorney for Elliott Management on Wednesday complained to a bankruptcy court judge that the owner of Texas's largest power distribution business did not provide the investment fund with information needed to line up financing for its offer of more than $18 billion to buy the company. Instead, Energy Future Holdings Corp, the bankrupt majority owner of Oncor Electric Delivery Co, struck a deal this month to sell its ownership of the business to Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) for $9 billion in cash, valuing the company at $18.1 billion.  A lawyer for Elliott Management, which spent years battling Argentina over its defaulted debt, told the court that the fund has enough debt in Oncor's parent, Energy Future, to block the Berkshire deal.  The fund has argued that its own $18.5 billion Oncor deal would be better for creditors. Gregg Galardi, Elliott's lawyer, said potential sources of financing for a rival bid had contacted Elliott, a $32 billion fund led by billionaire Paul Singer, but Energy Future had ignored requests for information to help structure a deal.  We need actual cooperation,  he said. Galardi also noted that Energy Future had not run an auction. Chad Husnick, who represents Energy Future, countered that Elliott had not signed a non-disclosure agreement with Oncor and said Energy Future would not shop its Oncor stake when Elliott had no committed financing.  My response is, show me the money and we’ll consider it,  he said. Husnick also told the hearing in Wilmington, Delaware, that the Berkshire plan could be confirmed. Two previous deals for Oncor, with Hunt Consolidated Inc and another with NextEra Energy (NEE.N), were rejected by Texas's Public Utility Commission after the plans were confirmed by the bankruptcy court. Husnick said the Berkshire proposal has already been discussed with PUC staff. He said Energy Future anticipates quick regulatory approval and then confirmation of the plan by the bankruptcy court, an approach that Judge Christopher Sontchi said he supported. Elliott has estimated creditors will be repaid around 24 cents on the dollar under the Berkshire proposal, compared to 80 cents under the deal NextEra Energy that was blocked by Texas regulators. A hearing on the schedule for reviewing the Berkshire plan was set for July 26. Energy Future has been in bankruptcy since 2014, filing after a consortium of private equity firms bought it for about $44 billion.

Levey,HSBC,MONEYLAUNDERING/ (UPDATE 3),Americas,United States","sector":"Homepage","content":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Wednesday blocked the release of a report discussing HSBC Holdings Plc's progress in improving its controls against money laundering, reversing a judge's order that the report be made public. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan said U.S. District Judge John Gleeson abused his discretion in his January 2016 ruling that the public had a constitutional right of access to the report under the First Amendment. HSBC had agreed to a monitor in December 2012, when it accepted a $1.92 billion fine and five-year deferred prosecution agreement to resolve a U.S. Department of Justice criminal probe. The department said HSBC had become a preferred bank for Mexican drug cartels and other money launderers, and conducted transactions for customers in several countries barred by U.S. sanctions. Wednesday's decision was a victory for HSBC and the Justice Department, which have said releasing the report could compromise efforts to fight money laundering, including for terrorism, and discourage cooperation with law enforcement. It was a defeat for Hubert Dean Moore, a Pennsylvania man who was an HSBC mortgage customer before filing for bankruptcy, and sought the report's release to identify whether problems persisted in HSBC's business practices. The report was kept under seal during the appeal.  We are pleased with the outcome,  HSBC chief legal officer Stuart Levey said in a statement.  This decision allows HSBC's agreement with the Justice Department to operate as intended.  HSBC admitted to violations in accepting the agreement, but could see the criminal case dropped by complying with its terms. Moore and his lawyer did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Unfortunately, the court has put private interests above the public interest.  In his ruling, Gleeson had said the report by the monitor Michael Cherkasky, a former New York prosecutor and now executive chairman of compliance company Exiger, implicated  matters of great public concern.  But the appeals court said the Justice Department oversees implementation of deferred prosecution agreements, which judges lack  freestanding supervisory power  to do even if they suspect problems.

The Briton leads Italian Fabio Aru by 18 seconds and France's Romain Bardet by 51 seconds and he will be watching them closely during a punishing 214.5-km trek in the Pyrenees ending with a short, brutal climb to Peyragudes. Twice champion Alberto Contador and, to a lesser extent, Colombian Nairo Quintana, had bad days in the ninth stage in the Jura last Sunday, but Froome will not give them space.  We don't want guys who have lost time to get back into the game,  the defending champion told reporters on the eve of the 50th anniversary of the death of Briton Tom Simpson on the slopes of Mont Ventoux. The last 50 kilometers of Thursday's stage are extremely brutal. The riders will tackle the climb up to the Port de Bales (11.7km at an average gradient of 7.7 percent), a descent to the foot of the Col de Peyresourde (9.7km at 7.8 pc), a very short downhill and the final ascent to Peyragudes (2.4km at 8.4 pc) with gradients sometimes reaching 20 percent.  It's quite savage. I think if someone blows in those few hundreds of meters (at 20 per cent), there could be some really significant time gaps,  said Froome.      It's one of the key stages of this year's race.  Froome is likely to race conservatively.  The number one priority is not to allow some guys to come back into the GC game and of course for me personally to keep a close eye on Aru,  the three-times champion said.  I will stick to him like glue.  Thursday's stage is made even trickier by the fact that the following one is a punchy 101km trek in the Pyrenees - the kind of short stage that is hard to control.  It's hard to hold anything back on a stage like tomorrow but the following day will be on the back of our minds,  said Froome. In 2013, in a similar stage, Team Sky were blown apart after repeated attacks early on and Froome was quickly isolated by his rivals.  It's going to be flat out racing, we know what to expect,  he said. Reporting by Julien Pretot; Editing by Ed Osmond","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-cycling-france-froome-idUSKBN19X2FX"},

Yellen, in a prepared testimony delivered to Congress, said the Fed would wind down its massive massive bond portfolio while keeping a close watch on the low inflation. The testimony depicted an economy that, while growing slowly, continued to add jobs, benefited from steady household consumption and a recent jump in business investment. Investors and some Fed officials, concerned with the recent dip in inflation, have been wanting to see a surer progress toward the central bank's goal of 2 percent inflation. Yellen said some temporary factors appear to be at work in holding down inflation but the Fed was focused on achieving the target.  It was a little bit more dovish than most had thought,  said Richard Scalone, co-head of foreign exchange at TJM Brokerage in Chicago.  She said rates won't have to rise much further to get to neutral, I thought that was key. She said inflation response to economy is a key uncertainty, alluding to the inflation again, part of the dovishness.  The U.S. central bank will also issue its Beige Book at 2 p.m. ET, a compendium of anecdotes on the health of the economy. The Fed's next policy meeting is on July 25-26. At 12:47 p.m. ET (1647 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 111.34 points, or 0.52 percent, at 21,520.41, slightly easing from its record high of 2158.79. The S&P; 500 was up 16.2 points, or 0.667895 percent, at 2,441.73 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 56.47 points, or 0.91 percent, at 6,249.78. Microsoft, Facebook and Amazon gave the biggest boost to the S&P; and the Nasdaq. Amazon shares edged up 1 percent after the online retailer said its Prime Day sale was the biggest shopping event by sales in its history. Ten of the 11 major S&P; 500 sectors were higher, with the real estate index's 1.26 percent rise leading the advancers. The financial index, which is sensitive to rate hikes, was the only laggard and was trading little changed. Chances of an interest rate hike at the Fed's December meeting fell to 53 percent from 60 percent after the release of Yellen's testimony, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool. Investors will be keeping an eye on second-quarter earnings reports on Friday from big U.S. banks including JPMorgan Chase , Wells Fargo and Citigroup.

The European Union's sanctions, painfully negotiated by all 28 EU governments in 2014 and so far renewed every six months, are the bloc's toughest response to Russia's annexation of Crimea and its support for separatists in eastern Ukraine. But it is up to each EU government to enforce them and they do not apply to companies' Russian subsidiaries, making any possible wrongdoing very hard to prove. Reuters reported on July 5 that two electricity turbines made by Siemens were shipped to the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea, which is subject to EU sanctions that ban EU firms from supplying energy technology there. Siemens said the turbines were transferred to Crimea without its knowledge and against its will.  Implementation and enforcement of EU restrictive measures rests with the member states,  a spokesman for the European Commission said in response to the Siemens case.  The Commission is in touch with the German competent authorities on this particular case,  the spokesman said, referring to Siemens. Still, economic sanctions on Russia, including those on Crimea, have deterred many EU firms from doing business there. EU exports to Russia fell by 40 percent between 2013 and 2016 to 72 billion euros ($82.09 billion), according to the EU's statistics office Eurostat. Direct investment by the European Union's 28 countries into Russia fell 18 percent to 162 billion euros between 2013 and 2015, the latest data available.  The reputational damage of a potential sanctions breach can be enormous,  said Maya Lester, a London-based barrister and author of a European sanctions website.  One practical effect of imposing sanctions can be about sending a message, as well as the restrictions themselves, and compliance is a big issue too.  Overall, the European Union has imposed sanctions banning most EU business with Crimea, has frozen the assets and prohibited travel for Russians linked to the Ukraine crisis and has limited EU investment in Russia's defence and energy sectors. Financing to Russian banks is severely restricted. Unlike the United States, which has robust economic and trade sanctions enforcement through its Office of Foreign Assets Control at the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the European Union has no single such agency. While the EU's institutions in Brussels are instrumental in drawing up the legal language for the punitive regime and drumming up diplomatic support for them, the few dozen experts who help design them do not have the resources to enforce them.  Theatrical rhetoric is not matched by enforcement,  said Tom Keatinge, director of financial crime studies at RUSI think-tank in London.  They have become symbolic,  he said, saying not enough was done to update sanctions to avoid both EU and Russian companies circumventing them. A Sept. 2016 investigation by Reuters showed that at least two European retailers, Auchan and Metro, were active on the Crimean market through Russian subsidiaries, shipping there from Russia via a ferry and port that are subject to EU sanctions. Furthermore, France last year granted Russian Agriculture Minister Alexander Tkachev a visa even though he has been banned from entering the EU since 2014 because of Crimea. No Database In April, Britain moved to a U.S.-style enforcement policy to allow civil fines of at least 1 million pounds ($1.28 million) on breaches of financial sanctions. However, Britain has not so far prosecuted any company for any potential breach of sanctions, Lester said. It was not immediately clear if other EU countries have brought criminal proceedings because no public database exists of sanctions breaches. Many EU countries rely on different agencies, from the central bank to the export licensing authority, to enforce measures. Refusal of licenses can be challenged in court, while customs offices and the public prosecutor are responsible for violations of export controls. EU officials have designed sanctions to be as specific as possible to avoid hurting the wider population, making loopholes easier to find. EU companies are expected to adhere to what EU officials call  the spirit  of the sanctions regime but it does not apply directly to their subsidiaries incorporated in Russia.  If the sanctions are too wide ranging, they may be too disruptive to the EU, or contribute to a financial crisis,  said Erica Moret, chair of the Geneva International Sanctions Network at the Graduate Institute Geneva.  The human costs of blanket sanctions have been too great in the past.  EU governments also want the measures to be able to be lifted quickly in case of a rapprochement with Russia. Defence, energy and financial sanctions could be removed if all sides implement the Minsk peace deal involving the withdrawal of troops and weaponry from eastern Ukraine. Russian denies any direct involvement in the conflict that has killed more than 10,000 people since April 2014.

The former Goldman Sachs president and current White House adviser has been tipped as top contender to replace Janet Yellen, Politico reported. Though not a trained economist, Cohn's years in finance put him ahead of other Donald Trump cabinet picks notably lacking relevant résumés. But a Wall Street trader's temperament makes a bad match for the staid central-bank job. The registered New York Democrat didn’t have a government background when he became director of the National Economic Council. Still, he had honed his finance skills during more than 25 years at Goldman and he quickly hired White House staff with complementary experience. His operation contrasted with those of cabinet members like Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, who struggled to answer basic questions about school curriculums in her confirmation hearing. Choosing Cohn as head of the central bank would be an unconventional pick. Over the last 40 years, Fed chairs have been economists and have also served at least two four-year terms. Yellen will have only served one if Trump does not renominate her. The last one-term, non-economist Fed chair was William Miller, who had been CEO of Textron before President Jimmy Carter tapped him. Amid high inflation, his policies tanked the U.S. dollar and he lasted just over a year. Cohn spent much of his time at Goldman as a trader. He joined its J. Aron commodities unit and became head of the divisions for fixed income, equities and global securities before becoming president. Goldman is known as the most alpha of the investment banks and the hard-charging job fit Cohn’s personality. Running the central bank is a more sedate affair. The staff consists of number crunchers with doctorate degrees in economics who pore over various models to analyze growth and employment. Press conferences after meetings by the interest-rate-setting committee are carefully scripted. Yellen, like her forebears, chooses her words carefully knowing any hint of surprise can rattle markets. Her predecessor, Ben Bernanke, learned that in 2013 when he said the central bank would no longer be purchasing bonds, causing U.S. Treasury yields to surge in what became known as the “taper tantrum.” Blunt talker Cohn may find such restrictions suffocating. Markets will prefer a more boring choice.BreakingviewsReuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

Since the end of April, the World Health Organisation said there have been more than 320,000 suspected cases of cholera - a   disease that causes uncontrollable diarrhea - and 1,742 deaths across more than 90 percent of the Arabian Peninsula country.  U.N. aid chief Stephen O'Brien told the Security Council on Wednesday the toll was likely much higher as aid workers could not reach remote areas of the impoverished, war-torn country.   This cholera scandal is entirely man-made by the conflicting parties and those beyond Yemen's borders who are leading, supplying, fighting and perpetuating the fear and the fighting,  O'Brien said. He called on the 15-member Council to  lean much more heavily and effectively on the parties and those outside Yemen  to end the conflict and humanitarian crisis. A Saudi Arabia-led coalition intervened in Yemen's civil war in 2015, backing government forces fighting Iran-allied Houthi rebels. The country, which relies heavily on imports for food, has become one of the U.N.'s top humanitarian crises.  Seven million people, including 2.3 million malnourished children - of whom 500,000 are severely malnourished under the age of five - are on the cusp of famine, vulnerable to disease and ultimately at risk of a slow and painful death,  he said. U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization Director-General Graziano da Silva said there had already been reports of people dying from hunger in some areas of Yemen and complained about a lack of funding and access.  We simply cannot act where we are most needed,  he told the council. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told the council the outbreak was  being driven by conflict, the collapse of the basic public services and malnutrition.  He said the WHO and the U.N. Children's Agency UNICEF were supporting more than 600 treatment centers and rehydration points in Yemen and planned to open another 500 centers but there was a shortage of doctors and nurses. Yemen's economy has collapsed and 30,000 health workers have not been paid for more than 10 months, so the United Nations has stepped in with  incentive  payments to get them to help with the fight against cholera. U.N. Yemen mediator Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed told the Security Council a Saudi donation of $67 million had helped slow the cholera spread and called on other donors to step up.

Morgan Stanley (MS.N) is evaluating options, including a sale, for Generali Leben which ceased underwriting new business in 2015 but still offers life insurance in Germany under different brands, the sources told Reuters.   A sale of certain portfolios within the German perimeter could be just one of several strategic options we said we would evaluate,  a Generali spokesman said on Wednesday, while Morgan Stanley declined to comment. Generali and fellow insurers are struggling to pay guaranteed returns to clients because of record-low interest rates. Combined with more stringent European capital rules, these have prompted some to offload life insurance operations. The Generali Leben portfolio would mark the largest closed book sale ever. Dutch insurer Aegon sold a 9 billion pound book of closed UK life business last year and Britain's Standard Life has said it is open to the sale of its 16 billion pound closed annuity portfolio. Given the complexity of Generali Leben, and the necessary approval from financial watchdog Bafin for any transaction, no deal is expected to emerge quickly, the sources said.  Generali may also opt to keep it if its price expectations are not met, they added. Ratings agency Fitch said on Wednesday that the outlook for German life insurance was negative, reflecting the pressures from low investment yields. Financial services groups specializing in the run-off of life insurance by acquiring policies until their expiry and aim to turn a profit by measures such as cutting administrative costs, are vying for the Generali Leben portfolio.  Among the three big life business units of the group (AachenMuenchner, Cosmosdirekt and Generali Leben) Generali Leben is more exposed to the low interest rates risk,  the Generali spokesman said.  One of the sources said that the insurer is hoping for a purchase price of 900 million euros for the portfolio, but that bidders value the business at closer to 400-600 million euros. Only a handful of smaller portfolios of the roughly 90 German life insurers have changed hands, including those of Arag Leben, Delta Lloyd, Basler Leben, Heidelberger Leben and Skandia. German firms such as Viridium - owned by Cinven and Hannover Re (HNRGn.DE) - and Fosun-backed Frankfurter Leben have shown interest in the Generali closed book, as has Bermuda-based Athene (ATH.N), the sources said.      These companies declined to comment. After fending off a possible takeover from Italy's biggest retail bank Intesa Sanpaolo earlier this year, Generali announced plans to leave markets where it lacks scale. The group aims to raise about 1 billion euros by selling businesses in 13 to 15 countries across the world, Chief Executive Philippe Donnet has said.  The insurer's roadmap includes selling operations in a handful of European countries such as the Netherlands and Belgium, where it is working with BNP and Deutsche Bank, respectively, sources told Reuters. Generali is also looking for new owners for subsidiaries in Portugal, Colombia, Ecuador and Panama, these sources said.

The new regulations will allow the German government to block takeovers if there is a risk of critical technology being lost abroad. They will take effect shortly with no need for parliamentary approval in a bid to protect critical infrastructure, including power grids and hospitals.  We remain one of the most open economies in the world, but we also need to take fair competitive conditions into consideration,  Economy Minister Brigitte Zypries said in a statement on Wednesday.  We owe that to our companies. They often compete with countries whose economies are not as open as ours,  she added. The move reflects pressure across Europe to limit takeovers by Chinese state-backed groups of prized European assets. The purchase last year of German robotics maker Kuka (KU2G.DE) by Chinese company Midea (000333.SZ) raised concerns that China was gaining too much access to key technologies while shielding its own companies from foreign takeovers. State-owned ChemChina's $43 billion purchase of Swiss pesticides and seeds group Syngenta, Beijing's biggest overseas acquisition to date, has increased pressure in Europe to curb foreign takeovers in strategically important sectors. At his first EU summit in June, French President Emmanuel Macron teamed up with Italy and Germany to call for a European mechanism preventing unwanted takeovers.  To introduce more scrutiny in deal-making, the 28 EU leaders called on the Commission to analyze foreign investments in sectors such as energy, banking and technology, where China seeks Europe's technological know-how.  A spokeswoman at the Commission said President Jean-Claude Juncker had set up a dedicated Commissioners' Group on Trade and Harnessing Globalisation to elaborate on possible actions for the President's State of the Union speech in September.   We take note of the newly published German decree,  she said, adding the Commission was aware of the concerns related to foreign investment in strategic sectors.    Equal Terms Reciprocal access has emerged as a key issue alarming European executives and politicians, who have complained about a lack of similar openings in China.   State-owned Chinese firms will continue to look for M&A; opportunities across the globe. But one thing that needs to change is reciprocity,  said Hernan Cristerna, co-head of global M&A; at JPMorgan.   Western boards are wondering if China will allow more foreign investment in Chinese companies. I think China understands the notion of reciprocity.  But China has so far been using its antitrust regime to discourage Western buyers from taking over Chinese firms, and lack of transparency and complex ownership structures have also proved a major hurdle. The EU has long allowed countries to bar takeovers on national security grounds. Earlier this year, the German economics ministry withdrew approval for China's Fujian Grand Chip Investment Fund to buy chip equipment maker Aixtron (AIXGn.DE), citing security concerns. Under the new German rules, operators of infrastructure companies should be better protected from investors from outside the EU. In addition, the government will be able to take twice as long - four months - in reviewing such deals. German industry association BDI and some politicians close to Chancellor Angela Merkel criticized the reforms.  The BDI rejects a law on foreign trade that increasingly blocks investments,  said BDI board member Stefan Mair.  We demand that Germany presents itself clearly as a country that is open to foreign investors.  Bankers also said the rules could backfire.  The new regulation adds a layer of complexity to cross-border transactions into Germany,  said Goldman Sachs partner Alexander Mayer.   The risk is that valuations of certain assets could be impacted in a negative way if investors fear that the government wants to protect German companies from takeovers,  he added. Balancing Act Other European countries including Britain and the Netherlands are planning to give governments power to intervene in takeovers of key infrastructure and pausing bids for a period of time to protect national security.     British Prime Minister Theresa May's legislative agenda included tightening laws on company takeovers and ensuring any foreign group buying important infrastructure did not undermine security or essential services. Yet May and other EU leaders need to strike a fine balance between protectionism and the growing need for foreign investments to sustain their economies. Italy is among EU countries that has seen some of its national champions, such as tire maker Pirelli, sold to Chinese firms. While seeking to protect its companies by trying to force corporate raiders to disclose what their ultimate intentions are, it can't afford to close the door on Chinese trade.     Any Europe-wide mechanism against foreign takeovers could give the EU similar powers to the U.S. where the Committee on Foreign Investment (CFIUS) considers the national interest and security ramifications of investment by overseas companies in American ones. Last year, CFIUS blocked the $2.8 billion sale of Philips' components lighting division Lumileds to an investor consortium led by GO Scale Capital of China.  China's voracious appetite for overseas acquisitions propelled Asia to the forefront of global deal-making for the first time last year, with Chinese direct investment in the European Union jumping by 77 percent to more than 35 billion euros ($39.9 billion), according to the Rhodium Group. But the pace of foreign investments is now slowing as Beijing has introduced a new capital control regime and doing deals in the U.S. has become increasingly difficult following the election of President Donald Trump.

And while the rate of deaths after PCI is higher for these nonagenarians than it is for younger patients, the benefits can outweigh the risks for some, Dr. Abhishek Sawant of the State University of New York at Buffalo and colleagues found. “We did show that patients who had lower risk and underwent this procedure actually did very well,” Sawant told Reuters Health in a telephone interview. PCI has been used for decades to restore blood flow in patients having a heart attack, and in patients with severe chest pain that doesn’t respond to other treatment. To better understand the risks and benefits associated with PCI in older patients, Sawant and his colleagues looked at medical data from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs on more than 67,000 veterans who underwent PCI between 2005 and 2014.  Overall, nonagenarians represented 0.4 percent of the group, but that proportion increased from 0.25 percent in 2008 to 0.58 percent in 2014. Thirty days after the procedure, 10.6 percent of the nonagenarians had died, compared to 1.4 percent of the younger patients. Mortality one year after the procedure was 16.3 percent versus 4.2 percent, according to the results in JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions. After the researchers took factors such as patients’ other health problems into account, they found that the nonagenarians were still about twice as likely to die within 30 days of PCI, and their one-year mortality was also roughly doubled compared to younger patients. Sawant’s team also found they could predict mortality among the nonagenarians based on the patient’s National Cardiovascular Data Registry (NCDR) CathPCI score, which is a risk-assessment tool widely used on people undergoing PCI but had not previously been shown effective among people 90 and older. Rather than rejecting a candidate for PCI out of hand based on age, Sawant said, physicians can use the NCDR CathPCI score to assess an individual’s risks, and then discuss these risks and potential benefits with the patient and his or her family.  In these very old patients, he noted, PCI may not substantially extend life, but by easing chest pain, it can make important differences in their quality of life. One caution about the study findings, the researcher noted, is that almost all the study participants were male - and the great majority of nonagenarians are female. Another limitation of the study is that the  excellent  results of PCI in this over-90 population were not compared to similar patients who didn't get PCI, writes Dr. David Holmes of the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, in an editorial accompanying the study. Still, the study provides valuable information for doctors looking to  optimize  longer-term treatment for these patients, he writes. “What’s been shown in multiple studies over the years is that chronological age alone should not be an exclusion to performing percutaneous coronary intervention in appropriately selected patients,” said Dr. Adam Skolnick of NYU Langone Medical Center in New York who specializes in geriatric cardiology.  “The study confirms that in appropriately selected patients the procedure can be performed safely with a low risk of complications,” he told Reuters Health in a telephone interview. About half of the nonagenarians in the study had PCI on an emergency basis to treat a heart attack, he noted. “If someone is in the throes of a myocardial infarction, time is of the essence,” Skolnick said. “Usually unless there’s a really strong contraindication we would proceed with PCI.” But for non-emergency situations, for example to treat chest pain, “I think these are individual decisions that should not be based on simple risk scores. They have to include a discussion between the patient and/or caregiver and the treating doctors,” Skolnick said. The patient’s goals should be central to any decisions made about whether to undergo PCI, he added, and if that goal is to live longer, it’s not clear that non-emergency PCI will extend life in this age group.

In June, Syria gave the United Nations permission to send humanitarian aid by road from Aleppo to the northeastern city of Qamishli to help thousands of people forced from their homes by the war with Islamic State. The U.N. World Food Programme (WFP) said it has now reached the town of Mansoura, west of Raqqa, and nearby rural areas which had been cut off from road deliveries since 2014.  Both locations are hosting people who recently fled Raqqa where U.S.-backed Syrian Kurdish and Arab forces have recently seized territory on three sides of the city after a long offensive.     Availability of food, water, medicine, electricity and other essentials has been dwindling, with the situation rapidly deteriorating,  said Andrej Mahecic, a spokesman from the U.N. refugee agency. WFP's Syria country director Jakob Kern said the agency had delivered canned food, juices, bread and other goods to families living in camps, exposed to scorching summer temperatures.  More than 190,000 people have been displaced from and within the Raqqa region since April, while up to 50,000 remain trapped in the city, according to U.N. officials.  Before the road to Qamishli was re-opened, the U.N. relied on costly airlifts from Damascus and road deliveries would save WFP some $19 million a year - enough to provide a year's food to 100,000 people - the agency said.  With these cost savings and improved access, we are now reaching more families and people returning to their homes who need our help,  Kern said in a statement. But the agency needed more funds to support them, he added.   We are desperately needing US$100 million to get us to the end of the year,  he said by phone, adding WFP provided food every day to 4 million people across Syria - the equivalent of half of Switzerland.

State-owned ChemChina's $43 billion purchase of Swiss pesticides and seeds group Syngenta, Beijing's biggest overseas acquisition to date, has increased pressure in Europe to curb foreign takeovers in strategically important sectors. At his first EU summit in June, French President Emmanuel Macron teamed up with Italy and Germany to call for a European mechanism preventing unwanted takeovers.  To introduce more scrutiny in deal-making, the 28 EU leaders called on the Commission to analyze foreign investments in sectors such as energy, banking and technology, where China seeks Europe's technological know-how.  A spokeswoman at the Commission said President Jean-Claude Juncker had set up a dedicated Commissioners' Group on Trade and Harnessing Globalisation to elaborate on possible actions for the President's State of the Union speech in September.   We take note of the newly published German decree,  she said, adding the Commission was aware of the concerns related to foreign investment in strategic sectors.    Equal Terms Reciprocal access has emerged as a key issue alarming European executives and politicians, who have complained about a lack of similar openings in China.   State-owned Chinese firms will continue to look for M&A; opportunities across the globe. But one thing that needs to change is reciprocity,  said Hernan Cristerna, co-head of global M&A; at JPMorgan.   Western boards are wondering if China will allow more foreign investment in Chinese companies. I think China understands the notion of reciprocity.  But China has so far been using its antitrust regime to discourage Western buyers from taking over Chinese firms, and lack of transparency and complex ownership structures have also proved a major hurdle. The EU has long allowed countries to bar takeovers on national security grounds. Earlier this year, the German economics ministry withdrew approval for China's Fujian Grand Chip Investment Fund to buy chip equipment maker Aixtron (AIXGn.DE), citing security concerns. Under the new German rules, operators of infrastructure companies should be better protected from investors from outside the EU. In addition, the government will be able to take twice as long - four months - in reviewing such deals. German industry association BDI and some politicians close to Chancellor Angela Merkel criticized the reforms.  The BDI rejects a law on foreign trade that increasingly blocks investments,  said BDI board member Stefan Mair.  We demand that Germany presents itself clearly as a country that is open to foreign investors.  Bankers also said the rules could backfire.  The new regulation adds a layer of complexity to cross-border transactions into Germany,  said Goldman Sachs partner Alexander Mayer.   The risk is that valuations of certain assets could be impacted in a negative way if investors fear that the government wants to protect German companies from takeovers,  he added. Balancing Act Other European countries including Britain and the Netherlands are planning to give governments power to intervene in takeovers of key infrastructure and pausing bids for a period of time to protect national security.     British Prime Minister Theresa May's legislative agenda included tightening laws on company takeovers and ensuring any foreign group buying important infrastructure did not undermine security or essential services. Yet May and other EU leaders need to strike a fine balance between protectionism and the growing need for foreign investments to sustain their economies. Italy is among EU countries that has seen some of its national champions, such as tire maker Pirelli, sold to Chinese firms. While seeking to protect its companies by trying to force corporate raiders to disclose what their ultimate intentions are, it can't afford to close the door on Chinese trade.     Any Europe-wide mechanism against foreign takeovers could give the EU similar powers to the U.S. where the Committee on Foreign Investment (CFIUS) considers the national interest and security ramifications of investment by overseas companies in American ones. Last year, CFIUS blocked the $2.8 billion sale of Philips' components lighting division Lumileds to an investor consortium led by GO Scale Capital of China.  China's voracious appetite for overseas acquisitions propelled Asia to the forefront of global deal-making for the first time last year, with Chinese direct investment in the European Union jumping by 77 percent to more than 35 billion euros ($39.9 billion), according to the Rhodium Group. But the pace of foreign investments is now slowing as Beijing has introduced a new capital control regime and doing deals in the U.S. has become increasingly difficult following the election of President Donald Trump.

In June, Syria gave the United Nations permission to send humanitarian aid by road from Aleppo to the northeastern city of Qamishli to help thousands of people forced from their homes by the war with Islamic State. The U.N. World Food Programme (WFP) said it has now reached the town of Mansoura, west of Raqqa, and nearby rural areas which had been cut off from road deliveries since 2014.  Both locations are hosting people who recently fled Raqqa where U.S.-backed Syrian Kurdish and Arab forces have recently seized territory on three sides of the city after a long offensive.     Availability of food, water, medicine, electricity and other essentials has been dwindling, with the situation rapidly deteriorating,  said Andrej Mahecic, a spokesman from the U.N. refugee agency. WFP's Syria country director Jakob Kern said the agency had delivered canned food, juices, bread and other goods to families living in camps, exposed to scorching summer temperatures.  More than 190,000 people have been displaced from and within the Raqqa region since April, while up to 50,000 remain trapped in the city, according to U.N. officials.  Before the road to Qamishli was re-opened, the U.N. relied on costly airlifts from Damascus and road deliveries would save WFP some $19 million a year - enough to provide a year's food to 100,000 people - the agency said.  With these cost savings and improved access, we are now reaching more families and people returning to their homes who need our help,  Kern said in a statement. But the agency needed more funds to support them, he added.   We are desperately needing US$100 million to get us to the end of the year,  he said by phone, adding WFP provided food every day to 4 million people across Syria - the equivalent of half of Switzerland.

Richard Boomgaardt, who lives in Britain and was head of State Street's transition management desk for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, pleaded guilty in federal court in Boston to conspiring to commit wire fraud and securities fraud. Boomgaardt, a citizen of Canada and the Netherlands, entered his plea two weeks after Edward Pennings, a former senior managing director in State Street's London office, pleaded guilty to a conspiracy charge in connection with the same scheme. The two men are among three former State Street executives to face U.S. charges in connection with the probe. The Boston-based bank in January agreed to pay $64.6 million to resolve related U.S. criminal and civil investigations. Boomgaardt, 44, in court acknowledged having engaged in conduct outlined in a five-page statement of facts. He faces up to five years in prison when he is sentenced. U.S. District Judge Denise Casper scheduled his sentencing for Dec. 13. The case followed a 2014 settlement between State Street and the UK Financial Conduct Authority in which the bank paid a fine of 22.9 million pounds, or $38 million at the time, for charging the six clients markups on certain transactions. From 2010 to 2011, Boomgaardt, Pennings and Ross McLellan - a former executive vice president at the bank - conspired to add the secret commissions to fixed-income and equity trades executed for certain clients, prosecutors said. The clients were using a State Street unit that helps institutional customers move investments between asset managers or liquidate large investment portfolios, prosecutors said. McLellan has pleaded not guilty to securities fraud and wire fraud charges. His trial, originally scheduled for Oct. 23, was delayed by a federal judge on Friday to June 4 to allow McLellan's lawyer to gather evidence overseas. The cases in U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts, are U.S. v. McLellan, et al, No. 16-cr-10094, and U.S. v.

Morgan Stanley (MS.N) is evaluating options, including a sale, for Generali Leben which ceased underwriting new business in 2015 but still offers life insurance in Germany under different brands, the sources told Reuters.   A sale of certain portfolios within the German perimeter could be just one of several strategic options we said we would evaluate,  a Generali spokesman said on Wednesday, while Morgan Stanley declined to comment. Generali and fellow insurers are struggling to pay guaranteed returns to clients because of record-low interest rates. Combined with more stringent European capital rules, these have prompted some to offload life insurance operations. The Generali Leben portfolio would mark the largest closed book sale ever. Dutch insurer Aegon sold a 9 billion pound book of closed UK life business last year and Britain's Standard Life has said it is open to the sale of its 16 billion pound closed annuity portfolio. Given the complexity of Generali Leben, and the necessary approval from financial watchdog Bafin for any transaction, no deal is expected to emerge quickly, the sources said.  Generali may also opt to keep it if its price expectations are not met, they added. Ratings agency Fitch said on Wednesday that the outlook for German life insurance was negative, reflecting the pressures from low investment yields. Financial services groups specializing in the run-off of life insurance by acquiring policies until their expiry and aim to turn a profit by measures such as cutting administrative costs, are vying for the Generali Leben portfolio.  Among the three big life business units of the group (AachenMuenchner, Cosmosdirekt and Generali Leben) Generali Leben is more exposed to the low interest rates risk,  the Generali spokesman said.  One of the sources said that the insurer is hoping for a purchase price of 900 million euros for the portfolio, but that bidders value the business at closer to 400-600 million euros. Only a handful of smaller portfolios of the roughly 90 German life insurers have changed hands, including those of Arag Leben, Delta Lloyd, Basler Leben, Heidelberger Leben and Skandia. German firms such as Viridium - owned by Cinven and Hannover Re (HNRGn.DE) - and Fosun-backed Frankfurter Leben have shown interest in the Generali closed book, as has Bermuda-based Athene (ATH.N), the sources said.      These companies declined to comment. After fending off a possible takeover from Italy's biggest retail bank Intesa Sanpaolo earlier this year, Generali announced plans to leave markets where it lacks scale. The group aims to raise about 1 billion euros by selling businesses in 13 to 15 countries across the world, Chief Executive Philippe Donnet has said.  The insurer's roadmap includes selling operations in a handful of European countries such as the Netherlands and Belgium, where it is working with BNP and Deutsche Bank, respectively, sources told Reuters. Generali is also looking for new owners for subsidiaries in Portugal, Colombia, Ecuador and Panama, these sources said.

The Mexican currency MXN=D2 gained about 0.7 percent to 17.781 per dollar, a level not seen since May 2016. It has more than recovered from a plunge after Trump was elected and threatened to impose punitive tariffs on Mexican goods to protect U.S. industry. Expectations that Trump will not shred the North American Free Trade Agreement have fed demand for the peso and helped make it the top-performing emerging-markets currency this year, with a 17 percent gain. On Wednesday it was 3 percent stronger than just before Trump unexpectedly won the election.  None of the fears associated with Trump relative to Mexico have come anywhere near to fruition,  said Richard Scalone, co-head of foreign exchange at TJM Brokerage in Chicago.  Assuming you don't see a spike in U.S. yields or an absolute implosion in the price of oil, I'd say the probability is that the peso continues to strengthen.  Scalone said the peso could reach 16 per dollar, a level where he would consider selling. Strategists in a Reuters poll on average forecast last week that the peso would end 2017 at 18.5 per dollar. Wednesday's peso gain stemmed partly from Premier Oil Plc's (PMO.L) discovery of potentially more than 1 billion barrels of oil off the coast of Mexico, a major victory for Latin America's No. 2 economy. Emerging markets currencies also benefited after Yellen said U.S. interest rates would not have to rise much further to reach what the Fed considers a neutral rate. An increase in the spread between U.S. and Mexican interest rates could lure more traders to borrow dollars to buy Mexican peso debt. At last week's G20 summit in Hamburg, Trump hailed progress on trade after meeting Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto for the first time, while Mexico's government said it expected a general agreement on modernizing NAFTA by the end of 2017.

The visit to North Dakota, which pumps about 1.1 million barrels of oil per day - more than some OPEC members - is part of Zuckerberg's plan to tour all 50 states this year and learn about their local economies and communities. While Zuckerberg, 33, is a vocal supporter of renewable energy development, he said the visit gave him an opportunity to meet with those who rely on oil and natural gas production for their livelihood and oppose tighter regulation of the energy industry.  Many people I talked to here acknowledged (climate change), but also feel a sense of pride that their work contributes to serving real needs we all have every day - keeping our homes warm, getting to work, feeding us and more,  Zuckerberg said in a Facebook post early Wednesday morning. The Facebook co-founder flew his private jet into Williston, the de facto capital of the state's oil industry, and toured a nearby drilling rig operated by Nabors Industries Ltd (NBR.N) and an oil well owned by Statoil ASA (STL.OL). Zuckerberg spent more than two hours with roughnecks on the drilling rig, asking about technology developments that have helped the U.S. shale industry in the past two years cut in half the time needed to drill a new oil well. Representatives for Nabors and Statoil were not immediately available to comment. In a picture accompanying the Facebook post, Zuckerberg can be seen wearing the oilfield uniform of fire-resistant coveralls and a hard hat. He is not wearing safety glasses or gloves but holds them in his left hand, a violation of rig safety rules.      Zuckerberg was extremely intrigued by all the technological developments in the oilfields,  said Ron Ness, head of the North Dakota Petroleum Council, the industry trade group that arranged the tour with Facebook. Zuckerberg later held a community meeting to discuss education and housing. Politicians were not allowed to attend. The months-long delay of the Dakota Access Pipeline, which transports the state's Bakken crude oil, was also a main topic.      A number of people told me they had felt their livelihood was blocked by the government, but when (President Donald) Trump approved the pipeline, they felt a sense of hope again,  Zuckerberg said.

Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt cut diplomatic ties and severed transport links with Qatar in June, accusing Doha of supporting terrorism. Qatar denies this. The feud threatens to undermine the region's efforts to position itself as an international business hub. It also raises concerns that some firms may have to pick sides. In a circular seen by Reuters on Wednesday, Qatargas requested key suppliers and service providers  establish full-fledged facilities in Qatar so that the response time to provide any materials or services are reduced.  The circular, dated July 11, said suppliers without such facilities should provide plans for setting them up by the end of July. Qatargas, which has capacity to produce 42 million tonnes of LNG a year, is largely owned by state-run Qatar Petroleum. Global energy firms including Total, Mitsui & Co and ConocoPhillips has small stakes. Many major suppliers of Qatargas have offices in Doha but store supplies in warehouses in Dubai's Jebel Ali Free Zone. An official working at a gas firm in the Gulf said Doha's move was a measure to protect operations of Qatar's LNG plants against possible further sanctions.  Qatar clearly thinks the threat of further sanctions such as 'them or us' business arrangements are worth noting and protecting against,  said the official, who asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the subject.  Qatar is asserting this change is for the long term so we shouldn't expect a return to the status quo at any point, with Qatar choosing to operate independently of the other GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) countries,  the official added. When Saudi Arabia broke ties with Qatar on June 5 it promised to  begin legal procedures for immediate understandings with brotherly and friendly countries and international companies to apply the same procedures as soon as possible . Last month, Saudi media reported Riyadh planned to demand that firms doing business in the kingdom would have to sever ties with Qatar. Experts said Riyadh might not be able to convince more countries to cut links with Doha, but they said it could force foreign firms to pick between doing business with Qatar or working in the much bigger Saudi market.

An average of more than one country a week has had its rating cut by the big rating agencies - S&P;, Moody's and Fitch - since the start of 2014. A new report from S&P; showed it had 30 sovereigns on downgrade warnings, or  negative outlooks  in rating firm parlance, at the start of the month, compared with just six on positive outlooks.  This outlook distribution suggests that negative rating actions are likely to continue to outnumber positive actions over the coming 12 months,  S&P; said in a mid-year review of its rating moves.   More downgrades are likely this year  that section of the report was titled. Some of the big economies with negative outlooks on their ratings include Brexit-bound Britain, which last year became the first AAA country to be cut by two rating notches at once, and still triple-A Australia. South Africa, which is being hit by political uncertainty and weak growth, is also on the list alongside other emerging market heavyweights such as Mexico, Turkey and Brazil. Over the past six months, S&P;'s ratings balance has been relatively unchanged in the regions around the world. There has been a marginal deterioration in Asia-Pacific and Europe, it said, somewhat countered by an improvement in Latin America and no change in the Middle East, the Commonwealth of Independent States, and Africa.  The outlook balance in the latter remains very high, but has somewhat improved from its trough at the end of 2015. This contrasts with Asia-Pacific and Latin America, where the outlook balance has deteriorated sharply over that period. Just over half of all rated sovereigns are investment grade ('BBB-' or above).  This ratio is the lowest it has ever been,  S&P; said.

Shares in the group, known for its trench coats lined in its camel, red and black check, topped the FTSE 100 index on Wednesday, as analysts said a 4 percent rise in like-for-like sales was double the expected rate. The stock was up 2.8 percent at 1,624 pence at 0841 GMT. Chief Financial Officer Julie Brown said Chinese consumer confidence had rebounded, resulting in stronger growth in mainland China and Hong Kong.  In Europe, Britain led the way, although growth has slowed as the group lapped the fallout from Britain's vote to leave the European Union last year, she said.  We continued to see strength in UK domestics and it even rose as we went through the quarter,  Brown said, contrasting with the somber mood of many mass-market retailers as consumer spending is squeezed by higher prices and subdued wages growth.

I am totally committed to this measure,  Rabello said after an event at the presidential palace, adding that he would not suggest changes to the plan.  The only one who should have a proposal is President Michel Temer and his team.

Two senior BNDES vice presidents quit after his remarks and Planning Minister Dyogo Oliveira told Reuters that the government was not discussing any changes to the new rate. The decision to replace the TJLP benchmark was a key step by Temer's administration to reverse decades of subsidized loans that have cost taxpayers trillions of reais without a significant effect on long-term growth. BNDES, the main provider of long-term corporate loans in Brazil, has offered subsidized loans for decades to boost economic growth and create jobs. However, rising public debt and increased scrutiny of the bank's lending policies after recent corruption scandals have led policymakers to propose changes, such as the new market-based benchmark, to boost transparency.

His government banned the company from bidding on new public works projects for a year in a measure published in the official gazette last Friday, but Macri said on Wednesday the company would be welcome to get back to work if Congress passed a law that would enable his government to negotiate a leniency deal.   In Brazil they continue to operate and they could keep working here in the future but first we need to know what happened in the past and we are stuck due to lack of a legal instrument,  Macri told reporters. His government proposed a bill that would allow companies to be punished for corruption and also enable them to sign leniency agreements in exchange for collaborating with prosecutors that was passed by the lower house on July 5. But Macri said a key clause allowing leniency agreements had been removed.  For some reason (lawmakers) prefer that Odebrecht does not talk,  Macri said. The proposal could be further amended before it is voted on in the Senate. In December, Odebrecht and petrochemical subsidiary Braskem SA settled with Brazilian, U.S. and Swiss authorities for a record fine of $3.5 billion. In that settlement, Odebrecht admitted to bribing officials in 12 countries, including $35 million in Argentina between 2007 and 2014. It is now trying to settle with the other countries it admitted to paying  bribes in, and prosecutors across Latin America initially vowed quick action. In Peru, a lack of convictions so far related to the $29 million in bribes that Odebrecht acknowledged paying in the Andean country has also stirred concerns that local investigations have stalled. However, Peruvian prosecutors who signed a collaboration agreement with Odebrecht have cited testimony from the company's former executives in criminal cases involving two former presidents.

Shares of ABM rose as much as 5.4 percent to $42.90, their biggest intraday percentage gain in more than four months. GCA Services is owned by Goldman Sachs Group Inc and private equity firm Thomas H Lee Partners LP. It  provides janitorial and custodial services to more than 3,200 public schools and over 80 colleges and universities across United States. Cleveland-based GCA Services also serves corporate office buildings, hotels, biopharma and defense companies, and utilities and warehouses. The company gets about 36 percent of its annual revenue from this business. Thomas H Lee affiliates and the merchant banking division of Goldman Sachs will own about 14 percent of ABM's outstanding shares, after the deal closes by September, the company said. This would make them its biggest shareholder, according to Thomson Reuters data. A year after the deal closes, New York-based ABM's annual revenue in its education services business is expected to jump to about $850 million from $250 million. Overall, GCA will add about $1.1 billion to ABM's annual topline, ABM said. ABM, which expects to incur about $70 million in one-time costs related to the deal, provides cleaning, parking and other general maintenance and repair services to office buildings, data centers and educational institutions among others. GCA has a  stellar reputation  in the education industry, ABM's chief executive Scott Salmirs said on a conference call on Wednesday. ABM's offer for GCA Services includes $851 million in cash and $399 million in ABM common stock. ABM said it expected to save $20 million to $30 million annually within two years of the deal closing.     J.P. Morgan Securities LLC advised ABM, while Goldman Sachs was financial adviser to GCA Services. ABM said it does not expect to do share repurchases in the near future, in light of the pending deal.

His government banned the company from bidding on new public works projects for a year in a measure published in the official gazette last Friday, but Macri said on Wednesday the company would be welcome to get back to work if Congress passed a law that would enable his government to negotiate a leniency deal.   In Brazil they continue to operate and they could keep working here in the future but first we need to know what happened in the past and we are stuck due to lack of a legal instrument,  Macri told reporters. His government proposed a bill that would allow companies to be punished for corruption and also enable them to sign leniency agreements in exchange for collaborating with prosecutors that was passed by the lower house on July 5. But Macri said a key clause allowing leniency agreements had been removed.  For some reason (lawmakers) prefer that Odebrecht does not talk,  Macri said. The proposal could be further amended before it is voted on in the Senate. In December, Odebrecht and petrochemical subsidiary Braskem SA settled with Brazilian, U.S. and Swiss authorities for a record fine of $3.5 billion. In that settlement, Odebrecht admitted to bribing officials in 12 countries, including $35 million in Argentina between 2007 and 2014. It is now trying to settle with the other countries it admitted to paying  bribes in, and prosecutors across Latin America initially vowed quick action. In Peru, a lack of convictions so far related to the $29 million in bribes that Odebrecht acknowledged paying in the Andean country has also stirred concerns that local investigations have stalled. However, Peruvian prosecutors who signed a collaboration agreement with Odebrecht have cited testimony from the company's former executives in criminal cases involving two former presidents.

BANK OF CANADA'S POLOZ: ANY ACTION WE TAKE TODAY WILL ONLY HAVE FULL EFFECT ON INFLATION OVER NEXT 18-24 MONTHS  We need to be targeting inflation in the future, so it is about where we expect inflation to be. Because any action we take today is only going to have its full effect on inflation over the next 18 to 24 months.  BANK OF CANADA'S POLOZ: MANAGING THIS PROCESS IN THE WAY WE ARE RAISES THE ODDS OF A SUSTAINED EXPANSION WITHOUT NEEDING TO STEP ON THE BRAKES  Managing this process in the way we are here, raises the odds of a sustained expansion, one that does not require actually stepping on the brakes.  Poloz on Communicating Policy:  We have come into the habit of giving a speech in between meetings ... in that we transparently described how we're seeing the latest data and so I think people picked up on that and said, 'it looks like the Bank's view is evolving'.   For us the ideal setting is where everybody is looking at the same data, and everybody is coming to a similar understanding of what's going on and wouldn't be hanging on to the Bank's every word.  POLOZ ON WHETHER RATE HIKE IS REMOVAL OF INSURANCE OR START OF TIGHTENING CYCLE:  There's no simple answer to that ... If that was the only thing that occurred over the whole time frame, then mechanically we need to remove that insurance, but so many other things have changed in the meantime.   I'm hesitating to classify it as either one.  Poloz on How Economy Will Handle Move and Interest Rates:  The most important thing is the economy clearly no longer need as much as stimulus as we've been giving it. But at the same time, we're letting you know that the world has changed enough...So we're monitoring carefully how the economy continues to adjust.  The economy can handle very well this kind of move today. Of course we'd preface that with the acknowledgement that of course interest rates are still very low.  In the full course of time, I don't doubt that interest rates will move higher, but there's no predetermined path.  BOC'S WILKINS: RECENT EXPORT DATA HAVE BEEN ENCOURAGING, MONTHLY GDP SHOW BROADENING DEMAND ACROSS SECTORS  We've seen, at the same time, some export data, more recently, that have been encouraging and some monthly GDP data that showed broadenings not only occurring across demand categories but also across sectors.  BOC'S WILKINS: IT'S THE DATA WE GOT SINCE MAY THAT HAS CONFIRMED OR MADE US MORE CONFIDENT IN OUR OUTLOOK  It's the data that we got since May that has either confirmed or made us even more confident in the outlook that we have.  BOC'S POLOZ: CAUTION ON DATA WAS AT ITS PEAK IN JANUARY BECAUSE OF UNCERTAINTIES U.S. ELECTION POSED  It's our job to be very skeptical of short-term movements in data. So that caution was probably at its peak in January, because of the uncertainties that the U.S. election posed for the economic outlook.  BOC'S POLOZ: IT'S OUR CONFIDENCE THAT HAS INCREASED THROUGH THOSE MONTHS COMPARED TO BEGINNING OF YEAR  There is an upward revision to our outlook of course because of the data that Caroline mentions but more importantly it's our confidence that has increased through those months compared to where we were at the beginning of the year. So it's that confidence in the outlook that makes us more confident today, to make the change we've made.  BOC'S POLOZ: FINANCIAL STABILITY IS ALWAYS ON THE TABLE AS WE DISCUSS POLICY  Financial stability is always present on table as we discuss these things.  Boc's Poloz: Uncertainty Around u.s. Trade Policy Remains  That (trade policy) uncertainty I think remains. Certainly, it is very prominent in our BOS (business outlook) survey. It is one of the first things that people say, that they still don't know what's going to happen. And it's not just trade, but also would there a fiscal shock of some magnitude in the U.S.  BOC'S POLOZ: INVESTMENT IN CANADA IS LESS TODAY THAN IT WOULD BE WITHOUT THAT UNCERTAINTY BUT COMPANIES SEEM TO BE SETTING IT ASIDE  Investment in Canada today is less today than it would be without that uncertainty. But people seem to be setting it aside and sort of getting on with things, so we are seeing a recovery, stronger investment, not as good as it would be without that but still there is one.  BOC'S WILKINS: OUR FORECASTS FOR EXPORTS AND INVESTMENT ARE VERY, VERY PRUDENT; TRIED TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT UNCERTAINTY THAT'S OUT THERE  Our forecasts for exports and investment are very, very prudent. You can see in the data, in our charts and we have tried to take into account the uncertainty that is out there. But we do highlight the downside risks.  BOC'S WILKINS: WERE VERY DISAPPOINTED IN Q1 EXPORT DATA BUT RECENT DATA MORE ENCOURAGING  We were really disappointed in Q1, that's for sure, with the unexpected fall, but the more recent data shows that exports are up across a wide range of categories, goods included. There are some special factors, sales of gold for example. But nonetheless, exports are off to a good start for the second quarter.  BOC'S POLOZ: WE THINK THERE'S STILL SOME ROOM TO GROW ONCE OUTPUT GAP CLOSES  Whenever there is a long cycle like the one we have been living though, I think you are more attentive to legacy affects ... so permanent scarring that may occur as a result of the prolonged nature of the down cycle, so that would take the form of skills that degrade perhaps, or there is enough structural change that people are no longer qualified to work, or actual exit from the workforce because of discouraged worker effects, and I have mentioned a number of times the youth retreat from the workforce and this sort of thing. So these are all reasons why we think that there is still some room to grow once the gap is closed.  BOC'S WILKINS ON THE EFFECT OF HIGHER INTEREST RATES ON PEOPLE WITH DEBTS:  We take into account the fact that households are indebted. One way to think of the possible effect is really to look at the higher interest rate. There are people who want to buy a house for the first time and they're affected immediately if mortgage rates increase at the same time. They have a choice of waiting a bit or buying somewhere less expensive or cutting their expenses.  As for households that already have a mortgage ... between 75 percent and 80 percent have a fixed rate and not everyone is going to have to renew their mortgage this year or next year ... but you have to look at the context (of the rate hike). The economy is growing, jobs will continue to grow, salaries will continue to rise, so it's in a context that is pretty good.  Boc's Poloz on Whether Rates Will Go Up Again This Year  I'm not going to make a forecast about the interest rate.  Poloz on Improving Economy:  The most important thing is that this is good news for Canada. That the accumulation of evidence, the growth in our confidence ... should be good news for everybody.  I know not everybody will think a higher interest rate is good news, but it's a symptom of an improving economy. Interest rates are still very low, so we're coming off a very low level.  Poloz on Infrastructure Program:  At the same time, the infrastructure program is in the background. I say in the background, because there's only certain bits of evidence where it's already showing up. But we know the money's been allocated, so that's something we can look forward to. That's in our model, that's an important part of this closing of the output gap, which is happening. It's not just interest rates that did this work, it's the fiscal part.  BOC'S POLOZ: STILL SOME ADJUSTMENT HAPPENING SINCE OIL PRICE SHOCK  At the onset of the oil price shock, there was considerable range of opinions on how the economy would respond. What we said then was it would take about two years for the worst of the adjustment to take place, that it was complex, that we'd monitor it along the way and we also said that the other 87 percent of the economy was likely to continue to benefit from the conditions that we found ourselves in.   Late last year, (the energy sector) did bottom out and it began to contribute to growth again, especially in the first quarter.   I don't want to give the impression that the adjustment is completely over, because there's certainly still plenty of adjusting going on. There are pain points, there are people still that lost their jobs and don't have another job, they haven't recovered fully.  BOC'S POLOZ: OIL IMPACT IS ENOUGH IN THE REAR VIEW MIRROR NOW, CONTRACTION IN SECTOR APPEARS TO BE COMPLETE  It's enough in the rear view mirror now and the big thing was the contraction of the sector - that appears to be complete. The companies can go on, obviously they'd prefer a higher oil price to a lower oil price, but in that .... $40 to $60 kind of zone that we've been in for a while now, that's going to become the norm and people have adjusted to that lower price by cutting costs and increasing efficiency.

Konta has kicked up a gear on the lush lawns of the All England Club and, after beating second seed Simona Halep in the quarters, is looking a great prospect to become the first home women's champion in 40 years.  Playing good tennis shots, that's not really how you win tennis matches,  former world number one Wilander told Reuters.  Confidence, that's how you win. Confidence, that's where you get the trophies.  Sixth seed Konta certainly seems long on confidence - a confidence that has seen her hit 166 clean winners so far, a women's draw best, and lead the women's ace count. It seems to be a case of joy rather than nerves for the 26-year-old.   I feel very, very happy and very excited for the battles that I've had so far in these Championships,  Konta told reporters after her quarter-final win.  I've been involved in some pretty great matches.  Those matches - her victory over Halep, a three-set win over Caroline Garcia the round before, and a three-set thriller over Donna Vekic - have had the British public enthralled. With Andy Murray now out of the men's tournament, the level of support and focus on Konta for her semi-final clash with Venus Williams will be intense to say the least. That will not bother the Briton, said Wilander, who is in London leading Eurosport's coverage of the tournament.  This has been one of those tournaments where you can never say who is the favorite. Players who haven't been so deep into the grand slam ... you don't know how players will respond. But Jo has proven she loves it.  Nothing seems to bother her.

David Wildstein, 55, a former executive at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and a high school classmate of Christie's, provided the key evidence that led to the conviction of two Christie allies.  Were it not for Mr. Wildstein's cooperation, it is unlikely that we are even here today,  Assistant U.S. Attorney Lee Cortes told U.S. District Judge Susan Wigenton in federal court in Newark, New Jersey. The judge sentenced Wildstein to three years of probation, noting that he was the only figure in the scandal to accept responsibility for his actions. Wildstein concocted a scheme to shut down access lanes at the George Washington Bridge in September 2013, causing massive traffic jams as punishment for a local Democratic mayor who declined to support Christie's gubernatorial re-election bid. The bridge between New Jersey and New York City is the world's busiest, according to the Port Authority, which oversees it. Christie, who was never charged, has denied any involvement, despite Wildstein's testimony that the governor was aware of the plot as it unfolded. The fallout damaged Christie's unsuccessful 2016 bid for the Republican presidential nomination, and he is now saddled with record-low approval ratings in his final year as governor. Wildstein's co-conspirators, former Christie aide Bridget Kelly and former Port Authority executive Bill Baroni, were found guilty after Wildstein's testimony implicated Kelly, Baroni, Christie and other key Christie administration figures. Kelly and Baroni were sentenced to 1-1/2 and two years in prison, respectively. They are free on bail while they appeal their convictions. Wildstein said that he, like Kelly and Baroni, had fallen victim to a toxic atmosphere fostered by Christie.  I admit to being a willing participant in a culture that was, upon reflection, disgusting,  he said.  Each of us put our faith and trust in a man that neither earned it or deserved it.  It was Wildstein's willingness to turn over incriminating messages to state legislators that ensured the scheme came to light, Cortes said. Those documents included an infamous email in which Kelly told Wildstein,  Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee,  setting the plot in motion. Kelly, Cortes said, had deleted that email along with others, leaving Wildstein as the only source of crucial information.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/new-jersey-bridgegate-idUSL1N1K30AU"},

The visit to North Dakota, which pumps about 1.1 million barrels of oil per day - more than some OPEC members - is part of Zuckerberg's plan to tour all 50 states this year and learn about their local economies and communities. While Zuckerberg, 33, is a vocal supporter of renewable energy development, he said the visit gave him an opportunity to meet with those who rely on oil and natural gas production for their livelihood and oppose tighter regulation of the energy industry.  Many people I talked to here acknowledged (climate change), but also feel a sense of pride that their work contributes to serving real needs we all have every day - keeping our homes warm, getting to work, feeding us and more,  Zuckerberg said in a Facebook post early Wednesday morning. The Facebook co-founder flew his private jet into Williston, the de facto capital of the state's oil industry, and toured a nearby drilling rig operated by Nabors Industries Ltd (NBR.N) and an oil well owned by Statoil ASA (STL.OL). Zuckerberg spent more than two hours with roughnecks on the drilling rig, asking about technology developments that have helped the U.S. shale industry in the past two years cut in half the time needed to drill a new oil well. Representatives for Nabors and Statoil were not immediately available to comment. In a picture accompanying the Facebook post, Zuckerberg can be seen wearing the oilfield uniform of fire-resistant coveralls and a hard hat. He is not wearing safety glasses or gloves but holds them in his left hand, a violation of rig safety rules.      Zuckerberg was extremely intrigued by all the technological developments in the oilfields,  said Ron Ness, head of the North Dakota Petroleum Council, the industry trade group that arranged the tour with Facebook. Zuckerberg later held a community meeting to discuss education and housing. Politicians were not allowed to attend. The months-long delay of the Dakota Access Pipeline, which transports the state's Bakken crude oil, was also a main topic.

The pan-European STOXX 600  index was up 1.5 percent, as were euro zone stocks .STOXXE and blue chips .STOXX50E, enjoying their best day's gains since April 24, when Macron's first round victory quashed market fears of a protectionist French president. European shares made early gains and were given a second wind in afternoon trading when Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen dampened expectations of more than one interest rate hike this year. All sectors were in positive territory, with miners, construction and healthcare sectors leading. A slower pace of interest rate raises is positive for equities, which benefit when their yield is relatively higher than other asset classes such as bonds. Norwegian lender DNB (DNB.OL) led the banking sector .SX7P higher, up 5.7 percent after its second-quarter earnings came in significantly above forecasts, helped by a rise in lending margins and lower losses on its portfolio. Luxury goods group Burberry (BRBY.L) was a strong gainer, rising 3.2 percent after reporting 3 percent underlying revenue growth in the first quarter, helped by robust demand in mainland China and continuing good performance in its British market. [nL8N1K30VY]  (This is) the strongest performance for at least three years in terms of ... same store sales, and also the signs of an underlying rebound in demand in mainland China are very, very promising,  Ken Odeluga, market analyst at City Index, said. Peers Kering (PRTP.PA) and LVMH (LVMH.PA) also rose 2.4 percent and 0.9 percent respectively. Online retailer Zalando (ZALG.DE) gained 4.2 percent after broker Societe Generale started its coverage of the stock with a  buy  rating, saying that it had the potential to play a much broader role in the future of fashion retailing. With the European second quarter results season just around the corner, earnings are expected to increase by over 9 percent from the same period in 2016, which would be a rise of over 6 percent excluding the energy sector, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S estimates.  Strength in oil and metals prices helped lift the heavyweight European energy sector .SXEP and basic resources .SXPP, which gained 1.5 and 1.9 percent respectively. The cyclical autos sector .SXAP was led by a 3.1 percent rise in Valeo (VLOF.PA) shares, which gained after the car parts maker said it was eyeing a sale of a unit to Raicam. Education publisher Pearson (PSON.L) continued its slide from the previous day when it announced plans to sell its stake in Penguin Random House, down around 4.7 percent as broker downgrades and cuts to estimates rolled in.     Investec, Panmure and Credit Suisse were among brokers revising down their targets for Pearson, with worries around its dividend persisting.  The guidance suggests a dividend of around 15p for 2017, rising to perhaps 18p at the most by 2019. This implies a dividend yield range of 2.3-2.7 percent and essentially takes away any yield support for the stock, in our view,  analysts at Panmure Gordon said. Shares in British oil and gas services company Amec Foster Wheeler (AMFW.L) slumped more than 8 percent after confirming that Britain's Serious Fraud Office (SFO) was investigating the firm and individuals associated with the business.

Shares of ABM rose as much as 5.4 percent to $42.90, their biggest intraday percentage gain in more than four months. GCA Services is owned by Goldman Sachs Group Inc and private equity firm Thomas H Lee Partners LP. It  provides janitorial and custodial services to more than 3,200 public schools and over 80 colleges and universities across United States. Cleveland-based GCA Services also serves corporate office buildings, hotels, biopharma and defense companies, and utilities and warehouses. The company gets about 36 percent of its annual revenue from this business. Thomas H Lee affiliates and the merchant banking division of Goldman Sachs will own about 14 percent of ABM's outstanding shares, after the deal closes by September, the company said. This would make them its biggest shareholder, according to Thomson Reuters data. A year after the deal closes, New York-based ABM's annual revenue in its education services business is expected to jump to about $850 million from $250 million. Overall, GCA will add about $1.1 billion to ABM's annual topline, ABM said. ABM, which expects to incur about $70 million in one-time costs related to the deal, provides cleaning, parking and other general maintenance and repair services to office buildings, data centers and educational institutions among others. GCA has a  stellar reputation  in the education industry, ABM's chief executive Scott Salmirs said on a conference call on Wednesday. ABM's offer for GCA Services includes $851 million in cash and $399 million in ABM common stock. ABM said it expected to save $20 million to $30 million annually within two years of the deal closing.     J.P. Morgan Securities LLC advised ABM, while Goldman Sachs was financial adviser to GCA Services. ABM said it does not expect to do share repurchases in the near future, in light of the pending deal.

The pan-European STOXX 600  index was up 1.5 percent, as were euro zone stocks .STOXXE and blue chips .STOXX50E, enjoying their best day's gains since April 24, when Macron's first round victory quashed market fears of a protectionist French president. European shares made early gains and were given a second wind in afternoon trading when Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen dampened expectations of more than one interest rate hike this year. All sectors were in positive territory, with miners, construction and healthcare sectors leading. A slower pace of interest rate raises is positive for equities, which benefit when their yield is relatively higher than other asset classes such as bonds. Norwegian lender DNB (DNB.OL) led the banking sector .SX7P higher, up 5.7 percent after its second-quarter earnings came in significantly above forecasts, helped by a rise in lending margins and lower losses on its portfolio. Luxury goods group Burberry (BRBY.L) was a strong gainer, rising 3.2 percent after reporting 3 percent underlying revenue growth in the first quarter, helped by robust demand in mainland China and continuing good performance in its British market. [nL8N1K30VY]  (This is) the strongest performance for at least three years in terms of ... same store sales, and also the signs of an underlying rebound in demand in mainland China are very, very promising,  Ken Odeluga, market analyst at City Index, said. Peers Kering (PRTP.PA) and LVMH (LVMH.PA) also rose 2.4 percent and 0.9 percent respectively. Online retailer Zalando (ZALG.DE) gained 4.2 percent after broker Societe Generale started its coverage of the stock with a  buy  rating, saying that it had the potential to play a much broader role in the future of fashion retailing. With the European second quarter results season just around the corner, earnings are expected to increase by over 9 percent from the same period in 2016, which would be a rise of over 6 percent excluding the energy sector, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S estimates.  Strength in oil and metals prices helped lift the heavyweight European energy sector .SXEP and basic resources .SXPP, which gained 1.5 and 1.9 percent respectively. The cyclical autos sector .SXAP was led by a 3.1 percent rise in Valeo (VLOF.PA) shares, which gained after the car parts maker said it was eyeing a sale of a unit to Raicam. Education publisher Pearson (PSON.L) continued its slide from the previous day when it announced plans to sell its stake in Penguin Random House, down around 4.7 percent as broker downgrades and cuts to estimates rolled in.     Investec, Panmure and Credit Suisse were among brokers revising down their targets for Pearson, with worries around its dividend persisting.  The guidance suggests a dividend of around 15p for 2017, rising to perhaps 18p at the most by 2019. This implies a dividend yield range of 2.3-2.7 percent and essentially takes away any yield support for the stock, in our view,  analysts at Panmure Gordon said. Shares in British oil and gas services company Amec Foster Wheeler (AMFW.L) slumped more than 8 percent after confirming that Britain's Serious Fraud Office (SFO) was investigating the firm and individuals associated with the business.

Mid-cap Carillion plunged to a record low. The blue-chip FTSE 100 index ended the day up 1.2 percent, with mining stocks leading the gains. Comments from Federal Reserve Chief Janet Yellen interpreted as dovish helped British stocks, sealing the FTSE's best day since April 24. Slower rate rises boost stocks, which benefit from a higher yield relative to bonds. Oil stocks supported the index as crude prices rose above $48 after a drop in U.S. fuel inventories raised hopes a supply glut was easing. Royal Dutch Shell and BP were up 1.8 percent each, among the top FTSE gainers. Spending by Chinese tourists making the most of a devalued pound boosted luxury trenchcoat maker Burberry, whose shares rose 2.5 percent after its like-for-like sales rose by double the rate expected by analysts.  This is an encouraging performance from Burberry, which looks to be at long last pulling out of the doldrums,  said Steve Clayton, manager of the Hargreaves Lansdown select UK growth fund. Micro Focus was among the stocks falling the most, dropping 7.4 percent. Disappointing full-year results cast doubts over its planned deal to acquire HP's software assets.  Micro Focus shares have been soggy since the May 9 news of poor trading at HPE Software, and now there are growing concerns about the expected U.S. flowback,  Stifel analysts said in a note. But shareholder Colin McLean, of SVM Asset Management, said,  We are still holding. We are not concerned on integration issues, there's bound to be hiccoughs.  Shares in education publisher Pearson slid again, hitting a three-month low on investor concern over a lower dividend guidance and Liberum's downgrad of the stock . Mediclinic shares jumped 4.7 percent. The South-Africa exposed private healthcare company was helped by a strengthening rand, and boosted by merger and acquisition speculation. Market rumour blog Wall Street Wires speculated that Mediclinic might bid for Spire Health, whose shares rose 4 percent. Reuters has not verified whether the companies are in talks. Outsourcer Carillion fell as much as 29 percent to a record low, taking its losses over the past three sessions to 70 percent as worries over a potential rights issue caused another broker downgrade. Marshall Wace led among hedge funds cashing out their short positions on Carillion. But holders of Carillion bonds were more downbeat, bracing for potential restructuring talks. Amec Foster Wheeler bucked the trend among oil and gas stocks, falling 5.5 percent after the oil services group said the Serious Fraud Office was investigating it over allegations of bribery and corruption. Wood Group, which agreed to buy Amec Foster Wheeler in a 2.2 billion-pound deal, fell 6.5 percent. Analysts said the merger would go ahead and should be completed in the fourth quarter. Small-cap Premier Oil shot up 36 percent after the company made an oil discovery off the shores of Mexico.

As long as investment performance and offered services meet client expectations, robo-advisors offer substantial scalability and cost efficiency, allow for better segmentation of existing client bases, and align with the increasing popularity of passive investing strategies among retail investors. Robo-advisors may also assist wealth managers in addressing new required fiduciary standards for U.S. retirement accounts. Robo-advisors will likely continue to see double-digit growth in assets under management (AUM) in coming years, albeit from a low base of less than $100 billion in 2016. A 2016 KPMG study, for example, estimated that robo-advisors' AUM will total over $2 trillion by end-2020, equating to a compound annual growth rate of 68% over the five years from 2016. We believe that the wealth management divisions of large banks will increasingly adopt the technology, following similar moves from traditional investment management firms such as Vanguard, retail brokers such as Charles Schwab, and internet-based companies such as Betterment. Morgan Stanley recently announced a robo-advisor platform to be rolled out this fall, becoming the latest bank to offer an automated advisory product. Firms launching robo-advisors will likely cannibalize some of their existing advisory services provided to clients. However, given the rapid growth and popularity of automated advisory products, firms could risk losing clients to other firms or hamper their ability to grow market share if they do not launch their own robo-advisors. As such, robo-advisors could be an increasingly relevant technology requirement for wealth managers to defend market positions. New automated products could come with operational and implementation risks. Challenges include maintenance of portfolios within stated risk tolerances, communication with clients, ensuring suitability of investments (ie. maintaining the fiduciary standard for retirement accounts), and maintaining strict cybersecurity. The performance of automated asset allocation and investment strategies under market downturns and severe volatility also remain untested. Robo-advising products differ between companies, but in general, offer digital portfolio management including automated asset allocation among a variety of passive investments, rebalancing, trade execution and tax management. Some also offer 24/7 access to human investment advisors by phone as a complement to the automated service. Including access to human advisors could increase the attractiveness of robo-advisors to wealthier individuals, who may require more hands-on interaction given greater financial needs and portfolio complexity. The rise of robo-advisors is being driven by a confluence of technological advancement and consumer adoption of financial technology, rapid growth in passive investment strategies, and regulatory change. Robo-advisors could better enable retail wealth managers to more efficiently service customers through tailored products that better meet the needs of differing client segments. Some firms will use robo-advisors to target self-directed investors with lower asset balances, relationships which may have previously been uneconomical to service via human investment advisors. Newly launched products from large wealth managers have had substantially lower minimum investment levels than existing products, reflecting the improved economics. Recently initiated regulatory changes could underscore the advantages of robo-advisors for wealth managers. Some firms have begun offering robo-advisors as part of their response to the introduction of the Department of Labor's 'Fiduciary Rule,' which requires investment advisors managing retirement accounts to maintain a fiduciary standard and operate in the client's best interests. Robo-advisors would not be exposed to conflicts of interest, provided their trading and investment management algorithms were properly designed and defined.

Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed. The information in this report is provided “as is” without any representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent).

In his first major address since becoming chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission earlier this year, Jay Clayton laid out his regulatory philosophy for how he plans to run the agency. The speech, which he was slated to deliver to the Economic Club of New York, was short on details about the specific rules or regulations that he would like to adopt or amend. However, his comments broadly called for efforts to scale back unnecessary corporate disclosures, reduce compliance burdens on small and mid-sized companies, ramp up the enforcement division's focus on protecting retail investors from run-of-the-mill frauds, and taking better care to retrospectively review SEC rules to ensure they are having the desired effect.  While there are many factors that drive the decision of whether to be a public company, increased disclosure and other burdens may render alternatives for raising capital, such as the private markets, increasingly attractive to companies that only a decade ago would have been all but certain candidates for the public markets,  he said in his prepared remarks. Clayton's comments Wednesday are likely to be welcome news to corporate trade groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which has long criticized an array of SEC disclosure rules for cluttering up corporate filings with unnecessary information. The Chamber has often sued the SEC over rules requiring disclosures that it said were not material, and has staunchly lobbied Congress to beat back other measures championed by pension funds, unions and progressive-leaning groups. Clayton appeared on Wednesday to echo some of their concerns generally, lamenting that lawmakers and regulators have  significantly expanded the scope of required disclosures beyond the core concept of materiality.  He also urged companies to apply to the SEC for requests to modify what they are required to include in their routine financial reporting, a process that is allowed under current SEC rules.  There are circumstances in which the commission’s reporting rules may require publicly traded companies to make disclosures that are burdensome to generate, but may not be material to the total mix of information available to investors,  he said. In addition to his comments on public company requirements, Clayton also said he plans to have the SEC launch a new fixed income market structure advisory committee to scrutinize the current rules and identify potential reforms. Clayton also said the SEC will consider a pilot program in coming months to study the impact of lower exchange fees. (Reporting by Sarah N.

The world's second-largest aluminum producer behind China's Hongqiao needs a further $700 million to complete the project, having invested about $800 million in Taishet before it was halted because of falling aluminum prices. Aluminum prices have jumped by 12 percent to $1,887 a tonne since the start of January and Rusal expects them to climb above $1,900 by the end of the year, said Deputy Chief Executive Oleg Mukhamedshin, citing the company's belief that the global deficit will reach 1.8 million tonnes in 2018, up 500,000 tonnes this year. The deficit expectations are largely down to top producer China's decision to order steel and aluminum producers in 28 cities to make heavy output cuts during the winter as Beijing intensifies its war on smog.  In this respect, we have a large competitive advantage related, above all, to the fact that we have resumed the Taishet aluminum smelter construction,  Mukhamedshin told reporters in Moscow. The first line of the smelter, with annual capacity of 430,000 tonnes, will be built by 2020 and Rusal is on track to agree financing with banks including state-run Vnesheconombank by the end of the year, he said. Mukhamedshin added that Rusal, controlled by Russian tycoon Oleg Deripaska, is also in talks to create a 50-50 joint venture for the project with state-controlled power company Rushydro. Rusal has said previously that it plans to expand annual capacity at its Boguchansk smelter in Siberia to 298,000 tonnes by 2018, up from 149,000 tonnes.     Mukhamedshin said that this plan was unchanged but further expansion of Boguchansk will depend on progress at Taishet and whether Rusal decides to proceed with an upgrade of its Khakas smelter in Siberia. Panda Bond Speaking to reporters about the company's future plans, Mukhamedshin said that Hong-Kong listed Rusal would consider placing a new tranche of its Chinese yuan-denominated Panda bond, depending on market conditions. Rusal placed a debut tranche in March. The current Panda bond program expires early next year and Rusal could start talks with China on a new program in the autumn, he added. Two sources close to Rusal told Reuters in June that the company was considering cancelling its Euronext listing in Paris and instead moving to a technical listing in London. Asked about this on Wednesday, Mukhamedshin said that no decision had been made and that Rusal was not considering placing any new shares.  We have a listing in Hong Kong, on the Moscow Exchange and on Euronext in Paris. The other question is that the main liquidity is being divided between Hong Kong and Moscow,  he said.  It is not a secret that there is no active (Rusal share) trade in Paris. But I cannot say anything new yet.

Benchmark zinc ended up 0.4 percent at $2,833 a tonne. Earlier, prices of the metal used to galvanise steel touched $2,874.50, the highest since March 30.  We've had a large drawdown in stocks. Investors have turned positive on industrial metals since China's June manufacturing PMI came out,  Capital Economics analyst Caroline Bain said.  We expect a 185,000 tonne deficit this year and a balanced market next year ... There are signs supply will improve.  INVENTORIES: Stocks of zinc in LME warehouses at 273,675 are down more 35 percent since the start of the year. A tight market is exacerbated by cancelled warrants - metal earmarked for delivery - at nearly 75 percent. MZNSTX-TOTAL SPREADS: Worries about supplies on the LME market are highlighted by the discount for cash over the 3-month forward, which has narrowed to near zero from around $20 a tonne in mid-June. MZN0-3 SHANGHAI STOCKS: Zinc inventories in warehouses monitored by the Shanghai Futures Exchange have plummeted more than 50 percent to below 67,000 tonnes since January. ZN-STX-SGH DEMAND: China accounts for nearly half of global demand estimated at around 15 million tonnes this year. DEFICIT: the International Lead and Zinc Study Group (ILZSG) said in April the zinc market was expected to see a deficit of 226,000 tonnes this year. FUTURE SUPPLY:  New large mines in Australia and South Africa will add 460,000 tonnes of supply by 2019,  Liberum analysts said in a note.  Slowing Chinese credit growth should bring implied steel demand back into negative territory. Zinc consumption should come under similar pressure given the high correlation.  CHINA: China's manufacturing engine cranked up in June, expanding at the fastest pace in three months, as new orders and production rose in a sign of a modest recovery. ALUMINIUM: Expectations of higher supplies to come to the LME market have seen the discount for cash over the three-month contract widen to above $16 a tonne, the highest since February, from near $4 a tonne at the end of June. MAL0-3 ALUMINIUM STOCKS: Latest LME data shows stocks rose 14,875 tonnes to above 1.39 million tonnes MALSTX-TOTAL. Three-month aluminium slid 0.6 percent lower at $1,889. ALCOA: Weighing on aluminium was news that Alcoa would partially restart its Warrick smelter in Indiana. CHINA DATA: Industrial metals were also boosted by Chinese banks extending more credit than expected in June. PRICES: Copper closed 0.5 percent higher at $5,905 a tonne, lead gained 0.9 percent to $2,327, tin rose 0.6 percent to $19,900 and nickel added 0.9 percent to $9,210 a tonne.

The Edinburgh-based lender on Wednesday said it agreed to settle the lawsuit with the U.S. Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) that accuses it of mis-selling $32 billion of mortgage-backed securities before the global financial crisis. Analysts had previously estimated RBS would have to pay between $3.5 to $5 billion to settle the case with the FHFA.  Today's announcement is an important step forward in resolving one of the most significant legacy matters,  RBS Chief Executive Ross McEwan said in a statement. McEwan has been trying to clean up RBS's balance sheet and end an array of legal cases so the government can sell its more than 70 percent stake in the bank after a 46 billion pound ($59.6 billion) bailout during the financial crisis. RBS said it will get a reimbursement of about $754 million  from other parties and the fine is largely covered by existing provisions. The bank said it will record a charge of 151 million pounds in next month's result related to the fine.  FILE PHOTO - People walk past a Royal Bank of Scotland office in London, Britain, February 6, 2013.Neil Hall/File PhotoIts shares traded almost 2 percent higher at 1255 GMT.  The case against RBS is the biggest and last of 18 lawsuits the FHFA filed in 2011 over about $200 billion in mortgage-backed securities that various banks sold to U.S. mortgage giants Fannie Mae (FNMA.PK) and Freddie Mac (FMCC.PK). The FHFA previously recovered $17.87 billion to resolve most of those lawsuits, including $5.83 billion from Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) and $4 billion from JPMorgan Chase & Co. The FHFA contended that in buying the mortgage-backed securities from RBS, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac relied on false and misleading statements contained in offering documents, leading them to suffer massive losses. In September 2008, the U.S. government appointed the FHFA as conservator for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac after seizing the mortgage financiers. Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc went bankrupt one week after that seizure. The British government has said it will not resume selling its stake until the bank settles its U.S. fines and resolves its state aid requirements. Taxpayers currently face a 29.2 billion pound loss on the value of the government's shares in RBS, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility, Britain's independent budget watchdog.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-rbs-probe-idUSKBN19X1NZ"},

Former U.S. President Barack Obama temporarily lifted the 20-year sanctions for six months in January, suspending a trade embargo, unfreezing assets and removing financial sanctions that have hampered the country's economy. But to earn permanent relief, Sudan was required to comply with five demands. They included resolving internal military conflicts in areas such as war-torn Darfur, cooperating on counter-terrorism and improving access to humanitarian aid.  We regret the issuing of this decision, which came after a long period of dialogue and interaction with the U.S.,  Foreign Minister Ibrahim Ghandour said on Wednesday after the decision on lifting sanctions was postponed.

It needs both to cope with an inflation rate of 35 percent and a shortage of foreign currency that has crippled its ability to purchase from abroad.

Rusal has said previously that it plans to expand annual capacity at its Boguchansk smelter in Siberia to 298,000 tonnes by 2018, up from 149,000 tonnes.     Mukhamedshin said that this plan was unchanged but further expansion of Boguchansk will depend on progress at Taishet and whether Rusal decides to proceed with an upgrade of its Khakas smelter in Siberia. Panda Bond Speaking to reporters about the company's future plans, Mukhamedshin said that Hong-Kong listed Rusal would consider placing a new tranche of its Chinese yuan-denominated Panda bond, depending on market conditions. Rusal placed a debut tranche in March. The current Panda bond program expires early next year and Rusal could start talks with China on a new program in the autumn, he added. Two sources close to Rusal told Reuters in June that the company was considering cancelling its Euronext listing in Paris and instead moving to a technical listing in London. Asked about this on Wednesday, Mukhamedshin said that no decision had been made and that Rusal was not considering placing any new shares.  We have a listing in Hong Kong, on the Moscow Exchange and on Euronext in Paris. The other question is that the main liquidity is being divided between Hong Kong and Moscow,  he said.  It is not a secret that there is no active (Rusal share) trade in Paris. But I cannot say anything new yet.

The move comes one day after the United States said it had postponed for three months a decision on whether to permanently lift sanctions imposed on Sudan, partly over concern about human rights issues [nL8N1K256J]. Former U.S. President Barack Obama temporarily lifted the 20-year sanctions for six months in January, suspending a trade embargo, unfreezing assets and removing financial sanctions that have hampered the country's economy. But to earn permanent relief, Sudan was required to comply with five demands. They included resolving internal military conflicts in areas such as war-torn Darfur, cooperating on counter-terrorism and improving access to humanitarian aid.  We regret the issuing of this decision, which came after a long period of dialogue and interaction with the U.S.,  Foreign Minister Ibrahim Ghandour said on Wednesday after the decision on lifting sanctions was postponed. The North African country wants to regain access to the global banking system, potentially unlocking badly needed trade and foreign investment. It needs both to cope with an inflation rate of 35 percent and a shortage of foreign currency that has crippled its ability to purchase from abroad.    European countries, regional and international institutions and some American institutions have recognized that Sudan has fulfilled the five-track plan in whole and this has been confirmed in technical meetings with the American side,  Ghandour said, referring to the list of U.S. demands.

In remarks to the House Committee on Financial Services, Yellen said the U.S. economy is strong enough to absorb further gradual rate increases and the slow wind down of the Fed's massive bond portfolio. The testimony depicted an economy that is growing, albeit slowly, and continues to add jobs as it benefits from steady household consumption and a recent jump in business investment. Given current estimates, the federal funds rate  would not have to rise all that much further  to reach a neutral level that neither encourages nor discourages economic activity, Yellen said in her prepared testimony. Equities markets rose on the view the Fed's monetary policy is not going to be as aggressive as some had anticipated, said Larry Hatheway, chief economist at asset management firm GAM.  The Fed isn't really going to upset the apple cart,  Hatheway said.  There's some softening here of what the Fed is going to do at least around rates. It doesn't  necessarily answer the question around its balance sheet.  MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.90 percent while the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading regional shares rose 1.64 percent and emerging market stocks rose 1.10 percent. . On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 130.65 points, or 0.61 percent, to 21,539.72, above a high set July 3. The S&P; 500 gained 16.44 points, or 0.68 percent, to 2,441.97 and the Nasdaq Composite added 57.55 points, or 0.93 percent, to 6,250.86. Bond yields, which move in reverse of price, fell sharply. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield fell to 2.302 percent , its lowest in two weeks, before paring some gains to trade at 2.3141. At the front-end of the curve, the two-year yield dropped as low as 1.331 percent from 1.379 percent on Tuesday and last traded at 1.3470 percent. Germany's 10-year government bond yield fell to 0.515 percent. The dollar, which fell against the euro soon after the release of Yellen's prepared remarks, reversed course and was trading near session highs against the common currency, as government bond yields in the euro area fell. The dollar index rose 0.11 percent, with the euro down 0.42 percent to $1.1417. The Japanese yen strengthened 0.64 percent to trade at 113.20 per dollar. Spot gold was up 0.23 percent at $1,220.11 an ounce. Oil futures pared gains despite a bigger-than-expected decline in U.S. crude stocks as the drawdown was not as big as reported by the American Petroleum Institute on Tuesday. U.S. crude inventories fell 7.6 million barrels last week, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said, much more than the 2.9 million-barrel crude draw forecast but slightly less than the 8.1 million-barrel decline reported by the API. U.S. crude rose 1.02 percent to $45.50 per barrel and Brent was last at $47.80, up 0.59 percent on the day.

The group's new blockchain asset management service is being offered in partnership with cryptocurrency broker Bitcoin Suisse.  We are proud to be the first-mover in the Swiss private banking area to provide blockchain asset management for our clients,  Arthur Vayloyan, Falcon's global head of products and services, said in a statement.  Falcon is convinced that the time is right to enter this nascent market and it is our firm belief that this new product will fulfill our clients' future needs,  he said. Bitcoin, the primary cryptocurrency, relies on  mining  computers that validate blocks of transactions by competing to solve mathematical puzzles every 10 minutes. The first to solve the puzzle and clear the transaction is rewarded with new bitcoins.

Fidelity Investments said in May that clients with bitcoins and other virtual currencies held on digital asset exchange Coinbase would be able to see their holdings on the Fidelity website, making it one of just a handful of large financial services firms to integrate digital currencies into its website. The virtual currency hit a record of almost $3,000 last month but has fallen over 20 percent since then to $2,375 on Wednesday. Its value has still more than tripled in the last year. Falcon, one of the Swiss banks ensnared in the Malaysian corruption scandal surrounding the troubled 1MDB fund, said the new offering was part of its strategic repositioning. The Zurich-based bank said its bitcoin asset management product had regulatory approval from Swiss financial watchdog FINMA, which declined to comment on individual providers or products.  It has been a pleasure assisting Falcon in realising this new product, which is nothing less than a historic milestone for the entire crypto space,  Bitcoin Suisse Chief Executive Niklas Nikolajsen said.

By a 3-0 vote, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan said U.S. District Judge John Gleeson abused his discretion in finding that the public had a constitutional right of access to the report under the First Amendment. HSBC agreed to a monitor in December 2012, when it accepted a $1.92 billion fine and five-year deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) to resolve a U.S. Department of Justice probe. The department said HSBC had become a preferred bank for Mexican drug cartels and other money launderers, and conducted transactions in several countries barred by U.S. sanctions. Wednesday's decision was a victory for HSBC and the Justice Department, which have said releasing the report could compromise efforts to fight money laundering, including for terrorism, and discourage cooperation with law enforcement. It was a defeat for Hubert Dean Moore, a Pennsylvania man who was an HSBC mortgage customer before filing for bankruptcy, and sought the report's release to identify whether there remained problems in HSBC's business practices. The report was kept under seal during the appeal. HSBC, the Justice Department, Moore and Moore's lawyer did not immediately respond to requests for comment. In a January 2016 ruling, Gleeson said the HSBC report by Michael Cherkasky, a former New York prosecutor and now executive chairman of compliance company Exiger, implicated  matters of great public concern  and justified its release. But in Wednesday's decision, Chief Judge Robert Katzmann said it is the Justice Department's responsibility to oversee how DPAs are implemented, while judges lack  freestanding supervisory power  to do so even if they suspect problems.  In resting its exercise of supervisory authority on hypothesized scenarios of egregious misconduct, the district court turned this presumption on its head,  Katzmann wrote. The court concluded that Cherkasky's report was not a  judicial document  deserving of public access. Gleeson, who sat in Brooklyn and is now a partner at law firm Debevoise & Plimpton, had no immediate comment. Twenty-five media outlets also urged the release of the HSBC report. They said the release of such documents, especially if fraud or executive branch conduct are at issue, helps the public hold the government accountable and understand how courts work. The case is U.S. et al v. Moore, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 16-308.

Banks fear losing their right to sell services across the EU and the potential shock to business if there is no transitional deal to cushion the impact of leaving the bloc. This was the first time Barclay, a 45-year-old former banker, has met privately with a group of senior City figures since he was appointed last month and comes amid a more conciliatory tone towards business after last month's election. Barclay spoke at a meeting of the advisory council of TheCityUK, the financial services lobby group, which meets three times a year, according to people who attended. He reiterated that Britain's finance ministry would prioritise four main points - transition, immigration, trade and regulatory co-operation - before taking questions from bankers.  Barclay was impressive as City Minister, with a good grasp of the issues, acknowledged the importance of the sector and its priorities, and was keen to hear practitioner views,  the chairman of Barclays Plc John McFarlane, who also chairs the CityUK, told Reuters. The Treasury declined to comment, while The CityUK declined to comment on the private gathering. Gets the Point Britain's financial sector employs 2.2 million people and its executives say the industry deserves to be a priority in the Brexit negotiations because it is the country's largest exporter and accounts for about 12 percent of its tax revenues. Britain's banking industry see the Treasury and finance minister Philip Hammond as their most powerful ally in government and bankers were worried when it appeared he might lose his job in the run-up to the election. But Hammond's reinforced influence and the appointment of key lieutenants like Barclay has been received positively. Barclay told the group that the debate within government about whether there should be a transitional deal has been won and the question now centres around how long it should last and what it should look like, according to a person who attended.  Barclay was clear that he got the transition point,  said another person who attended and asked not to be named. The performance was in contrast with that of his predecessor, Simon Kirby, who was criticised for having too little knowledge of finance after a similar meeting with senior finance executives in November at which he made jokes about a former City minister appearing on  Strictly Come Dancing .  That was a car crash. This was completely different,  said one person who was present at both meetings. However, any thawing in relations between two pillars of Britain's establishment may have arrived too late to prevent bank jobs moving from London overseas. Top executives at five of the largest banks in the capital told Reuters a staggered deal on leaving the EU is only likely to be agreed late on in talks with Brussels, meaning they have already begun relocating staff.

That’s a legitimate criticism of many of the protesters who tried to disrupt last week’s G20 meeting of world leaders in Hamburg, Germany. It is also a reasonable comment about the explanations which professional economists would typically offer the malcontents. That similarity was noted at a much smaller, if less raucous, meeting last week of a group of rebellious economic thinkers who gathered for a two-day seminar at Oxford University's Blackfriars Hall. The men and women at Blackfriars would agree with many of the G20 politicians and the street crowds that the recovery from the 2008 financial crisis remains incomplete. Few economists anticipated the crisis, but many of them are persuaded that they now know how to create jobs and push up growth rates. Unfortunately, they argue furiously with each other about what precisely to do. No one has a killer argument to silence the opposition.  It is the same story – missed trends, contradictory theories and unpersuasive recommendations – when it comes to explaining and dealing with many current economic issues: two decades of global disinflation, the right economic role of governments, the rise of inequality in some countries and the pace of technological innovation (experts cannot even decide if it slowing or accelerating). Any healthy intellectual discipline will always have some big unsolved mysteries, but economics has enough to suggest that its basic approach to reality is deeply flawed.  That is where the developing “Blackfriars School” comes in. Of course, this small band is neither the first nor the only group to complain about the standard approach to economics. There was a great wave of dismay as early as 1798, when English cleric Thomas Malthus first claimed that a rising population would always keep wages close to subsistence level. Critics said he was inhumane and unduly pessimistic. After two centuries of rising prosperity and almost a century of falling birth rates, it is clear the critics were right. However, Malthus has been almost as influential among economists as he has been wrong about reality.  The critics have also been right to complain that many other once standard economic beliefs were dangerously simplistic and incomplete. Marxists were wrong about total state control of the means of production; the old-style liberal trust in totally free markets was excessive, as is the new-style liberal trust in big governments. None of a series of monetary theories has been able to keep away or to defang financial crises. Perhaps the worst basic idea in economics is the nasty picture of human nature as purely self-interested and calculating. Many economists admit that these assumptions are both unrealistic and insulting, but they still feature in introductory textbooks, and are still widely used in game theory and so-called Welfare Economics. The justification is that the assumptions are supposed to be useful. But how useful can something so far from the truth really be? Not very, to judge by all the unsolved mysteries.  Complaining is easy. Finding a better way is much harder. The Blackfriars group, led by Senior Fellow Peter Rona, is one of many efforts by so-called heterodox thinkers to present a coherent new approach. This group’s first result is a book, published earlier this year,  Economics as a Moral Science .  Last week’s symposium is expected to lead to a second volume.  The book’s title holds the key, actually the two keys. First, there's science. As Rona pointed out in his Oxford presentation, the objects that economists currently study are essentially different from the objects of physics, chemistry and other mathematically modeled sciences. Economists’ demand curves, utility functions and inflation rates are mere mental constructions or statistical oversimplifications. Such unnatural and nebulous concepts tend to generate narrow, impractical and implausible theories.  The way forward is to recognise that economics is a social science. There is no point in studying market exchanges in isolation from social institutions and power structures, or from people’s varying and shifting beliefs, aspirations and fears.  The protesters in Hamburg want economic justice, and economists should be able to help. To do that, they need to integrate morality, the second key word, into their theories. Economists cannot really describe what people do without understanding what they are trying to do, and thinking about whether their goals are actually laudable.  Even if arguments about the economic good are never resolved, they can still be helpful. For example, morally aware economists could guide a debate on the relative value of, say, investing in countering climate change or in reducing absolute poverty. They would think more clearly than the average G20 protester.  Today’s economists, who exclude morality from their studies as unscientific, are not up to this challenge. Their standard professional techniques – think multivariate regression analysis and complex specifications of indifference curves – are not relevant. Still, they do know something about costs and benefits. Add some recognition of the value of aspirations and the indignity of misery, and the pace of intellectual innovation could definitely accelerate.  Right now, the leading university economics departments are about as likely to sponsor social and moral economic analysis as the G20 leaders are to invite protesters to run their meetings. But failure breeds frustration. Who knows, maybe the Blackfriars School is planting the seeds of a revolution.BreakingviewsReuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

In support of the  Internet-Wide Day of Action to Save Net Neutrality,  more than 80,000 websites are displaying alerts, ads and short videos to urge the public to oppose the overturn of the landmark 2015 net neutrality rules. Net neutrality is a broad principle that prohibits broadband providers from giving or selling access to speedy internet, essentially a  fast lane,  to certain internet services over others. The rule was implemented by the Obama administration in 2015. The changes are being proposed by the head of the U.S. Federal Communications Commision, Ajit Pai, appointed by President Donald Trump in January. The public will have until mid-August to send comments to the FCC before the final vote. Pai wants the commission repeal the rules that reclassified internet service providers as if they were utilities. He thinks the open internet rules adopted under former President Barack Obama, a Democrat, were unnecessary and harm jobs and investment. Twitter and Google, part of Alphabet Inc, expressed in blog posts their support for the existing net neutrality rules, encouraging users to participate in the online protest. Twitter was also promoting the hashtag #NetNeutrality throughout the day.  Net Neutrality is foundational to competitive, free enterprise, entrepreneurial market entry – and reaching global customers. You don’t have to be a big shot to compete. Anyone with a great idea, a unique perspective to share, and a compelling vision can get in the game,  Twitter said. Popular online forum Reddit displayed a slow-loading logo and a pop-up notice warning its users of the risks associated with repealing net neutrality rules. One of the top posts on the forum was  Your online gaming is once again at risk. Net Neutrality needs your help.  Others like Netflix and Amazon Inc displayed banners on top of their home pages or posted short videos explaining net neutrality, urging consumers to send comments to the FCC. Internet provider AT&T; Inc also joined the big protest even though the wireless giant in the past has disagreed with staunch net neutrality advocates over how to enforce it. The Internet Association, a group representing Facebook Google and others, has said the rules were working and that reversing them  will result in a worse internet for consumers and less innovation online.

The NFL's Cowboys, who last year unseated Spanish soccer club Real Madrid for top spot on the list, were valued at $4.2 billion, a 5 percent jump compared to last year, Forbes said in a statement. Major League Baseball's New York Yankees, who have both the highest sponsorship revenue and premium seating revenue in MLB, jumped two spots to second on the list as their value rose 9 percent to $3.7 billion. Soccer clubs Manchester United ($3.69 billion), Barcelona ($3.64 billion) and Real Madrid ($3.58 billion) rounded out the top five. The NFL's Los Angeles Rams were the biggest gainer, moving from outside the top 50 to 12th as their value doubled to $2.9 billion with their relocation from St. Louis last year.  Relocations and new stadiums are fueling big increases in the value of NFL teams, with the Cowboys the economic model every franchise hopes to match,  said Kurt Badenhausen, senior editor, Forbes Media.  Jerry Jones turned a money-losing franchise into the most profitable sports franchise in the world as AT&T; Stadium generates the highest sponsorship and premium seating revenue in the sport.  Teams from the NFL, whose lucrative broadcast contracts are not comparable to any other league, accounted for over half of the list, occupying 29 spots in the ranking, including the Super Bowl champion New England Patriots ($3.4 billion) at No. 6. The Cincinnati Bengals, Buffalo Bills and Detroit Lions were the only NFL teams that did not make the list.

The Indonesian government, seeking to fund infrastructure projects, launched a tax amnesty scheme last year to bring back billions of dollars stashed abroad. Most of the offshore assets declared by taxpayers during the amnesty programme were kept in Singapore, with total previously hidden assets valued at 741.6 trillion rupiah ($55.5 billion). About 11 percent of those assets were expected to be repatriated back to Indonesia. On Wednesday, Singapore's Ministry of Finance said in a statement the city-state  is ready to have an Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information (AEOI) relationship with Indonesia . Singapore signed a Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement (MCAA) on June 21 under which it listed Indonesia as one of its intended partners, the ministry added. The MCAA will facilitate the automatic exchange of financial account information and avoid the need for separate bilateral competent authority agreements to be concluded. Indonesia had previously pursued a bilateral agreement with Singapore, having already signed one with Hong Kong in June. On Wednesday, Indonesia's Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati and Singapore's Senior Minister of State for Law and Finance Indranee Rajah met on the sidelines of an International Monetary Fund tax conference in Jakarta.  By automatically exchanging informations with Singapore, we can detect our taxpayers that are doing cross country businesses and we can...know how much tax liabilities that they have to pay,  Indrawati told reporters after the meeting. Singapore and Indonesia are both signatories to the AEOI led by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Both countries can commence to exchange financial informations starting next year if they have introduced the necessary legislations to implement the AEOI and ensure data protection, Indrawati said.

The arrests came on Wednesday as part of an investigation involving 300 police officers. But officials said they believe the 100 kg (220lb) Canadian  Big Maple Leaf  coin, made with unusually pure gold, has been melted down. Armed police in balaclavas were outside a property in the Neukoelln area of Berlin, along with paramedics. The spectacular robbery from one of Berlin's most prestigious museums in the center of the capital, and from behind bullet-proof glass, stunned Germans. Police and prosecutors told reporters the four men, aged between 18 and 20 years-old, were linked to an Arab clan suspected of being involved in other crimes such as jewelry theft. Prosecutor Martina Lamb described how she believed the men had, with the help of someone who worked at the museum, used a ladder, wheelbarrow and rope to extract the coin and escape with it. Police have also said they believed the robbers had broken in through a window at the museum.

Mumbai-based Culture Machine said the new policy was a bid to fight social taboos around menstruation in India, where millions of women and girls face social discrimination, health problems and low self-esteem due to a lack of awareness. The firm, which has 75 female workers, announced the policy in a video on YouTube this month. It features female employees talking the first day of their periods and reacting to the news of the company's  First Day of Period (FOP) Leave  policy.  The first day is obviously not so comfortable for most,  said Devleena S. Majumdar, president of Human Resources at Culture Machine, in the video.  So we felt it was time we face reality. This is not an embarrassment, this is a part of life.    In India, menstruation is rarely discussed openly and this can leave girls and women ignorant about the issue and subject to social exclusion due to age-old social beliefs.  Menstruating women and girls are considered unclean and impure and are subjected to discrimination during their periods when, for example, they may not be allowed to go to the temple, or prepare and touch certain food.  In the video, which has had over 150,000 views since July 3, Culture Machine's female staff talk of their experiences at work on the first day of their periods and the taboos and lack of understanding around the issue of menstruation.   Sometimes with male bosses, you have to be a little discreet,  said one female employee.  The company has also launched a petition on change.org calling on India's Minister for Women Maneka Gandhi and the Minister for Human Resources Prakash Javadekar to adopt a similar policy for all women irrespective of where they work. The petition, which has attracted over 25,000 signatures in a week, asks why menstruation be kept hidden and why women have to show up for work despite the pain and use  silly excuses .  We, the women at Culture Machine's Blush, have the privilege, if we may call it that, to apply for a leave on the day when the discomfort is unmanageable, no questions asked,  said the petition.  Now, we want the rest of the women in India to have the same right.

The 37-year-old spent 45 minutes on the dusty Aorangi Park practise courts on Wednesday, hitting back serves delivered at high velocity by a male hitting partner. Williams sent many returns whistling back to the baseline, occasionally getting a thumbs up from her coaching team, while others sailed way beyond the margins of the court. Konta tops the ace leaderboard in the women's singles with 28, one more than Williams who is the oldest woman to reach the Wimbledon semi-finals for 23 years. Against Simona Halep on Tuesday, Konta offered up only two break points in a match lasting two hours and 38 minutes.  Johanna's serve is a massive weapon,  her coach Wim Fissette told Reuters this week.  Most woman players would like a first serve as good as Jo's.  Following her quarter-final victory over Jelena Ostapenko, Williams told a news conference that she would be expecting a close battle with her British opponent.  I think we play a very similar style,  she said.  Aggressive, serve well, return well, very solid off the ground. So really it's just about playing that game better and see where you find openings on that day.  Williams is bidding to win her sixth Wimbledon singles title and eighth grand slam -- nine years after last lifting the aptly-named Venus Rosewater Dish on Centre Court.

The Supreme Court ruled unanimously that John Walker's husband was entitled to a spouse pension and that the law was discriminatory, making Britain one of few countries to provide equal access to pension benefits for same-sex couples.  I am absolutely thrilled at today's ruling, which is a victory for basic fairness and decency,  Walker said in a statement following a five-year court battle.   Finally this absurd injustice has been consigned to the history books – and my husband and I can now get on with enjoying the rest of our lives together,  he added. Britain legalized same-sex marriage in 2014 but a legal loophole allowed an employer to refuse to pay pension benefits to a former employee's partner if they were in a civil partnership or same-sex marriage and had paid into their pension fund before December 2005. This meant if Walker was married to a woman, or married a woman in the future, his spouse would receive about 45,000 pounds ($58,000) a year after his death. Walker's same-sex partner, before the ruling, would have received 1,000 pounds. Walker, 65, and his husband have been together since 1993. The Supreme Court ruling stated the law was incompatible with European Union (EU) anti-discrimination laws and overturned it with immediate effect. The judgment stated that E.U. legislation had transformed the status of gay and lesbian employees in Britain, raising concerns that legal protections would weaken after Britain's exit from the bloc.  This ruling was made under EU law and is a direct consequence of the rights protection the EU gives us,  said Emma Norton, lawyer for rights group Liberty who represented Walker.  We now risk losing that protection. The government must promise that there will be no rollback on LGBT rights after Brexit – and commit to fully protecting them in UK law.

These credit strengths continue to be counterbalanced by Fitch's view of elevated operational risk (inclusive of cyber security risks) present in the business model as well as the sensitivity of earnings to multiple market factors. Fitch notes that idiosyncratic operational risk remains the main risk to the trust and processing bank business model, though this has generally been well controlled through significant technology investments and operational risk capital held against any potential losses. Over the course of the last year, the U.S. Trust and Processing banks have benefited from higher short-term interest rates, resulting in net interest margin (NIM) expansion and strong growth in net interest revenue. This has helped drive operating performance improvement for the group as measured by return on average equity. Additionally, these companies continue to be relatively well positioned to continue benefiting from the shift from active management to more passive management given their growing exchange traded fund (ETF) products and servicing capabilities. These revenue tailwinds combined with Fitch's view of the still significant but slowing growth of compliance and regulatory related expenses, inclusive of those related to resolution planning initiatives, may enable the trust and processing banks to make additional investments in technology initiatives or return more capital to shareholders. Additional technology investments could include efforts to digitize previously manual back and middle office operations, which Fitch believes will allow the firms to further manage expenses by reducing headcount. Further, with each firm focused on making its processing more automated, this effort should reduce the incidence of routine operational losses on a prospective basis. The trust and processing bank technology investments also consist of investments in more  disruptive  technology initiatives, which have the potential to dramatically change the way these companies operate by reducing the latency embedded in the operations and potentially making the business model more scalable. The most significant technology focus is on distributed ledger technology (DLT), more commonly referred to as  blockchain .  Northern and Bank of New York have publicly touted their nascent use of distributed ledger technology in specific applications within their operations.  This technology could impact the operations of these businesses over a longer-term horizon through lower operational risk and strong operating efficiencies.  At the same time, Fitch also acknowledges that DLT also poses the risk of unknown competitor(s) making inroads in transaction processing and eroding some of the barriers to entry in the trust and processing industry. The ultimate impact of DLT is currently unclear and likely remains outside of Fitch's Rating Outlook horizon. Importantly, the binding capital ratio for the largest trust banks, State Street and Bank of New York, is the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio (ESLR), given the significant deposit flows that can occur during market downturns. Each bank complies with its ESLR, at both the holding company and main-bank subsidiary level.

At the meeting of the NATO-Russia Council in Brussels, NATO ambassadors will press Moscow for Russian pilots to file flight plans, respond to air traffic control or identify themselves with cockpit transmitters, known as transponders.   There have been a series of unsafe intercepts,  a NATO official said of Russian pilots.  Risk reduction remains a concern.  The Kremlin says all Russian flights over the Baltic are conducted in strict accordance with international law. Wrangling in the Baltic Sea between Moscow and the Western alliance is intensifying. In June, Russia scrambled a jet to intercept a nuclear-capable U.S. B-52 bomber it said was flying over the Baltic, in an incident that had echoes of the Cold War. NATO said last month it tracked three Russian aircraft over the sea, including two jets which it said did not respond to air traffic control or requests to identify themselves. Russia says the incident involved a NATO F-16 fighter jet buzzing a plane carrying Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu as it flew over the Baltic and that the F-16 was seen off by a Russian Sukhoi-27 military jet.  The NATO-Russia Council, the forum bringing together NATO ambassadors and Russia's top diplomat to the U.S.-led alliance, is seen as a means to prevent tensions escalating, even when joint exercises and peacekeeping have been suspended. At the meeting, Russia's envoy to the alliance, Alexander Grushko, is expected to discuss the issue, as well as the conflict in eastern Ukraine that has killed more than 10,000 people since April 2014. NATO accuses Moscow of direct support for the separatists and for supplying weapons and troops. Russia denies any involvement and says the conflict is more akin to a civil war. The meeting of the Council is only the fifth since the crisis in Ukraine halted regular talks in 2014 and is also set to discuss planned military exercises in the coming months. Russia and Belarus aim to hold joint war games in September that some North Atlantic Treaty Organisation allies believe could number more than 100,000 troops and involve nuclear weapons training, the biggest such exercise since 2013.

Yellen, in a prepared testimony delivered to Congress, said the economy is healthy enough to absorb further gradual rate increases and the slow wind down of the Fed's massive bond portfolio. The testimony depicted an economy that, while growing slowly, continued to add jobs, benefited from steady household consumption and a recent jump in business investment. Investors and some Fed officials, concerned with the recent dip in inflation, have been wanting to see a surer progress toward the central bank's goal of 2 percent inflation. Yellen said some temporary factors appear to be at work in holding down inflation but the Fed was focused on achieving the target.  It was a little bit more dovish than most had thought,  said Richard Scalone, co-head of foreign exchange at TJM Brokerage in Chicago.  She said rates won't have to rise much further to get to neutral, I thought that was key. She said inflation response to economy is a key uncertainty, alluding to the inflation again, part of the dovishness.  The U.S. central bank will also issue its Beige Book at 2 p.m. ET, a compendium of anecdotes on the health of the economy. The Fed's next policy meeting is on July 25-26.

All 11 major S&P; 500 sectors were higher, with the defensive utilities index's 0.91 percent rise leading the advancers. The financial index, which is sensitive to rate hikes, pared early losses to trade little changed. Chances of an interest rate hike at the Fed's December meeting fell to 53 percent from 60 percent after the release of Yellen's testimony, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool. Investors will be keeping an eye on second-quarter earnings reports on Friday from big U.S. banks including JPMorgan Chase , Wells Fargo and Citigroup.

The Rating Outlook remains Stable. A full list of rating actions follows at the end of this rating action commentary. KEY RATING DRIVERS IDRs, VR AND SENIOR DEBT The affirmation of BK's ratings reflects its strong franchise in the asset servicing, asset management, clearing businesses, conservatively managed balance sheet and strong liquidity position. BK's ratings continue to be supported by its leading franchise in global trust and custody and a competitive position in the asset management and private wealth management businesses, along with its dominant position in securities clearing. This scale and breadth of product offerings, in businesses that have high barriers to entry, result in strong and sticky client relationships. Fitch views BK's low risk and highly liquid balance sheet as a key rating strength, with about 49% of its assets invested in cash and high quality securities. This is a product of BK's conservative risk appetite and its business model, which generates significant operational deposits. Fitch believes custody and clearing deposits are core in nature and notes that the trust and processing banks have historically been viewed as safe havens during periods of market stress that further enhances the liquidity and funding profile. Management continues to be focused on improving the company's processes in order to address several challenges facing BK, including highly competitive pricing for trust and processing business, industry-wide revenue headwinds in asset management, and elevated regulatory costs. In order to achieve positive operating leverage, management has continued to digitize and automate previously manual processes, consolidate and modernize technology platforms, and reduce structural expenses through location, vendor management, and other programs. BK has also built new technology solutions such as its collateral management and NEXEN platforms to drive new revenue. Fitch believes management has demonstrated good execution on these initiatives. BK's returns following the Great Recession generally lagged peers on a return on equity (ROE) basis and fell short of Fitch's estimated cost of equity (10% to 12%). Over the past five quarters, ROE has hovered around 10% and is now roughly in line with peers. Fitch notes this has occurred while BK has maintained its strong underwriting standards and conservative balance sheet positioning. Fitch expects that BK's earnings will show further improvement over the medium term as management's technology investments and expense initiatives will allow the company to better realize the economies of scale embedded in its business model. Additionally, Fitch believes BK's remain sensitive to higher short- term interest rates. Since the Federal Reserve began rising interest rates late in 2015, BK's net interest margin (NIM) has risen from 0.98% at the end of 2015 to 1.14% at the end of the first quarter of 2017 (1Q17). Fitch considers BK appropriately capitalized in the context of its low-risk balance sheet. As of 1Q17, BK's fully phased-in Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Ratio was 10.0%, essentially unchanged from a year ago. Its Fitch Core Capital Ratio of 8.1% at 1Q17 is also similar to prior periods. Similar to State Street, BK's more binding capital ratio is the Enhanced Supplementary Leverage Ratio (ESLR), which comes into effect on Jan. 1, 2018. U.S. rules will require BK to have at least a 5% ESLR at the holding company and 6% at the bank level. During 2016, BK came into full compliance with the final rules and further improved its ratios to 5.9% at the holding company and 6.6% at the main bank in 1Q17. This comes as management has continued to optimize the balance sheet for the new regime by pushing out some excess deposits. Fitch believes this has been achieved without damaging client relationships or the company's funding profile. DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTY RATINGS The Derivative Counterparty Ratings (DCRs) of BK and its subsidiaries are at the same level as the respective companies' Long-Term IDRs because they have no definitive preferential status over other senior obligations in a resolution scenario. SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR The Support Rating (SR) and Support Rating Floor (SRF) reflect Fitch's view that senior creditors cannot rely on receiving full extraordinary support from the sovereign in the event that BK becomes non-viable. SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES Subordinated debt and other hybrid securities are notched from BK's VR of 'aa-' in accordance with Fitch's criteria for such instruments. Subordinated debt is one notch below the VR for loss severity. Hybrid securities are rated five notches below the VR, reflecting three notches for non-performance and two notches for loss severity. Capital trust securities have been notched down four notches from the VR. HOLDING COMPANY The VR of BK is equalized with the VRs of its U.S. depositories, including its main bank subsidiary, The Bank of New York Mellon (BNYM). This reflects BK's role as a bank holding company, which is mandated in the U.S. to act as a source of strength for its bank subsidiary. Fitch notes that BK's holding company common equity double leverage is above 120% as of 1Q17. The holding company's VR remains equalized due to its significant liquidity resources, which offset the higher debt burden. SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANIES BNYM and the other U.S. depositories' Long-Term IDRs are one notch above the parent company's Long-Term IDR. This reflects the implementation of total loss absorbing capital (TLAC) requirements for U.S. Global Systemically Important Banks (G-SIBs). The VRs remain equalized between BK and its material operating subsidiaries, namely BNYM. The common VR of BK and its operating companies reflects the correlated performance, or failure rate, between BK and these subsidiaries. BK's material international subsidiaries, The Bank of New York Mellon S.A./N.V. and its branches and The Bank of New York Mellon (International) Ltd., have IDRs equalized with BK's because of their integration and core strategic role within the group. Fitch believes a default at one of these entities represents significant reputational risk for the parent. The support rating of '1' reflects Fitch's view of an extremely high probability of institutional support for these entities. LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS BK's domestic (uninsured) deposit ratings are one notch higher than its senior debt ratings reflecting uninsured depositors' superior recovery prospects in case of default given depositor preference in the U.S. These ratings are sensitive to any changes in BK's VR. RATING SENSITIVITIES IDRs, VR AND SENIOR DEBT BK's ratings are already near the top of Fitch's global rated bank universe. As a result, Fitch believes there is limited potential for upward rating momentum. Fitch believes that the main threat to BK's business model and ratings would result from a large idiosyncratic technological or operational loss resulting in reputational damage that causes clients to flee the firm. BK has been making significant investments in its technology systems over the past several years, which we believe helps to reduce potential idiosyncratic events that are prone to cause large losses. Fitch believes these operational risks have been well monitored and controlled, but also acknowledges that they are inherently difficult to predict and quantify. As such, a large occurrence that causes a revenue loss of 5% or greater would likely prompt Fitch to review the ratings to determine if a negative rating action was appropriate. Additionally, negative ratings pressure could emerge should BK materially alter its strategy, for example by entry into or divestiture of a key business line, which in Fitch's opinion alters the agency's view of BK's risk appetite. Currently, Fitch does not expect the affirmative BREXIT vote to overly impact BK's business; however, it may change the way that BK conducts business with some of its foreign clients. Finally, Fitch also notes that BK and its peer trust and processing banks are beginning to face the risk of technological disruption to their business, though this is likely to occur over a very long-term time horizon. Distributed ledger technology, or  blockchain , is an electronic means of settling, reconciling, and reporting on transactions, which is the core of BK and its peer banks' businesses. While Fitch believes it is highly probable that BK and its peer trust and processing banks will work to harness this technology to drive efficiencies across their respective platforms, it is also possible that over a long period of time a technology company could offer a distributed ledger solution that causes clients to go elsewhere for their core custody business. At present, Fitch views this risk as well outside of the Outlook horizon. DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTY RATINGS DCRs are primarily sensitive to changes in the respective issuers' Long-Term IDRs. In addition, they could be upgraded one notch above the IDR if a change in legislation (for example as recently proposed in the EU) creates legal preference for derivatives over certain other senior obligations and, in Fitch's view, the volume of all legally subordinated obligations provides a substantial enough buffer to protect derivative counterparties from default in a resolution scenario. SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR The Support Rating and Support Rating Floor are sensitive to any change in Fitch's view of the U.S.'s propensity to support its banks. While not impossible, Fitch views this as highly unlikely. SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES BK's subordinated debt ratings are broadly sensitive to the same considerations that might affect the company's VR. HOLDING COMPANY Fitch could notch the holding company's IDR further from the operating company's IDR if holding company liquidity were to deteriorate, raising concerns as to the parent's ability to meet its obligations. SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANIES Given that the VRs of BK and its U.S. depositories, including BNYM, remain equalized, the U.S. depositories' ratings are broadly sensitive to the same considerations that might affect BK's VR. LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS The ratings of long- and short-term deposits issued by BK and its subsidiaries are primarily sensitive to any change in the company's IDR. This means that should a long-term IDR be downgraded, deposit ratings would be similarly impacted. Fitch has affirmed the following ratings: Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (The) --Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'AA-'; Outlook Stable; --Long-term senior at 'AA-'; --Long-term subordinated at 'A+'; --Short-term IDR at 'F1+'; --Viability Rating at 'aa-'; --Preferred Stock at 'BBB'; --Derivative Counterparty Rating at 'AA-(dcr)'; --Support Rating at '5'; --Support Rating Floor at 'NF'.

The remarks, released in advance of testimony to Congress on Wednesday at 10:00 a.m. EDT (1400 GMT), however, said the Fed would not need to raise rates  all that much further  to reach current low estimates of the neutral fed funds rate.  Citing continued job and economic growth along with negative inflationary impacts that are believed to be transitory in nature, Yellen outlined in her congressional testimony the Fed's belief that the current monetary stance will be continued,  Sean Coakley, market strategist at Cambridge Global Payments in Vancouver, said in a note. The Fed raised rates last month to a range of 1 percent to 1.25 percent, and market expectations are roughly of a 50 percent probability that interest rates will rise again before the end of the year, according to the CME's Fed watch data. The dollar, which fell against the euro soon after the release of the remarks, reversed course and was trading near session highs against the common currency, as government bond yields in the euro area fell.  I think the market had initially misread Yellen’s comments. I don’t see them as being dovish,  said Marc Chandler, global head of currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against six major rivals, was up 0.09 percent to 95.753, after briefly falling to 95.511, its lowest since June 30.  This could be a potentially positive technical development, that we tested a low and not make a new one,  Chandler said. Meanwhile, the Canadian dollar rose against its U.S. counterpart after the Bank of Canada raised interest rates for the first time in nearly seven years, citing confidence in its outlook and a need to look through soft inflation. The loonie strengthened to $1.2812, its strongest against the U.S. dollar since August 2016. Slightly-better-than-expected wages and jobs data saved Britain's pound from another downward lurch on Wednesday, offsetting a series of political and economic warning signs as talks on leaving the European Union get going in earnest.

The Rating Outlook remains Stable. A full list of rating actions follows at the end of this rating action commentary. KEY RATING DRIVERS IDRs, VR AND SENIOR DEBT The affirmation of NTRS' ratings reflects the company's solid franchise in institutional asset management, private wealth management, asset custody, low risk appetite, continued sound operating performance and highly liquid balance sheet. The company's ratings are supported by its business model, which Fitch believes benefits from high barriers and economies of scale. The custody business also brings NTRS ample levels of deposit funding that Fitch considers core in nature. Fitch views NTRS' conservatively managed balance sheet as a key rating strength. The company has 66% of its assets invested in cash and high quality securities, 91% of which are rated 'AAA' or 'AA'. Additionally, NTRS' net charge-offs in its loan portfolio have remained below 10 basis points in each of the last three years, which demonstrates the company's strong underwriting standards and low risk appetite. Fitch believes NTRS' management team has been responsible for cultivating the company's conservative risk culture over many years, which is a key ratings differentiator relative to many other financial institutions. Despite headwinds from highly competitive pricing in the custody business, continued high regulatory costs, and revenue challenges affecting the asset management industry, NTRS has demonstrated solid growth in its core businesses, with fee growth at 6% year-over-year in the 1st quarter of 2017 (1Q17). Fitch believes management continues to successfully differentiate its businesses through technology investments and new products, such as its factor-based investment solutions. Management has made progress on several expense management measures to improve efficiency, along with reviewing custody relationship pricing to better align revenues and costs in the core business. Some current investment initiatives related to information technology (IT) and regulatory and compliance staffing have elevated non-interest expense. Fitch notes that some of the IT investments should improve efficiency in the long run by automating manual processes and taking structural costs out of the business. NTRS' earnings have remained solid from a credit perspective and are slightly ahead of its peer group on a return on average equity (ROAE) basis. NTRS earned an 11.6% ROAE in 1Q17, which is in line with Fitch estimated cost of equity (10% to 12%) for the company. Fitch believes management's various initiatives have positioned the company well for meaningful operating leverage in the future. NTRS' earnings remain sensitive to further increases in short-term interest rates. Since the Federal Reserve began increasing rates late in 2015, NTRS' net interest margin (NIM) has risen from a low of 1.07% at the end of 2015 to 1.35% and the end of 1Q17. Fitch believes NTRS' earnings have potential to show meaningful improvement if short-term interest rates continue to rise due to its short duration balance sheet and stable funding base. Fitch views NTRS' capitalization as solid for its rating level in the context of its low risk balance sheet. As of 1Q17, the company had a Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Ratio of 12.2% under the standardized approaching, up from 10.6% in the prior year due to conservative shareholder returns by management. While NTRS' capital plan approved by the Federal Reserve included a $750 million buyback, nearly three times higher than last year's request, Fitch believes NTRS will continue to manage its CET1 Ratio in its range from the past several years. SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR NTRS' Support Rating (SR) of '5' reflects Fitch's view that external support cannot be relied upon. The Support Rating Floor (SRF) of 'No Floor' reflects Fitch's view that there is no reasonable assumption that U.S. government support would be forthcoming to NTRS. SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID INSTRUMENTS NTRS' subordinated debt rating is notched one level below its VR of 'aa-' while NTRS' preferred stock rating is notched five levels below its VR. Capital trust securities have been notched down four notches from the VR. These ratings are in accordance with Fitch's criteria and assessment of the instruments' non-performance and loss severity risk profiles. These ratings have been affirmed due to the affirmation of the VR. LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSITS The uninsured deposit ratings for the Northern Trust Company are one notch higher than NTRS' IDR and senior unsecured debt reflecting the deposits' superior recovery prospects in case of default given depositor preference in the U.S. HOLDING COMPANY The IDR and VR of NTRS are equalized with those of the operating company, the Northern Trust Company, reflecting its role as a bank holding company, which is mandated in the U.S. to act as a source of strength for its bank subsidiary. RATING SENSITIVITIES IDRs, VR AND SENIOR DEBT Given NTRS' ratings are already near the top of Fitch's global rated bank universe, there is limited potential for upward ratings momentum. Fitch believes the most significant risk to NTRS is a large operational or technological event that causes significant reputational damage and causes clients to leave the firm. NTRS has a good track record of performance and minimal operational losses, and Fitch considers these risks to be well managed. However, negative rating action could be driven by an operational loss or similar event result in a fine, loss, or revenue reduction equivalent to 5% of annual revenue or more. Currently, Fitch does not expect the affirmative BREXIT vote to overly impact NTRS' business; however, it may change the way that the company conducts business with some of its foreign clients. Finally, Fitch also notes that NTRS and its peer trust and processing banks are beginning to be at risk of certain technology potentially being disruptive to its business, though this is likely over a very long-term time horizon. Distributed ledger technology, or  blockchain , is an electronic means of settling, reconciling, and reporting on transactions -- the core of NTRS and its peer banks' businesses. While Fitch believes that it is highly probable that NTRS and its peer trust and processing banks work to harness this technology to drive efficiencies across their respective platforms, it is also possible that over a long period of time a technology company offers a distributed ledger solution that causes clients to leave NTRS for their core custody business. At present, Fitch views this risk as well outside of the Rating Outlook horizon. SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR An upward revision to the SR and SRF would be contingent on a positive change in the U.S.'s propensity to support its banks. While not impossible, Fitch views this as highly unlikely. SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID INSTRUMENTS The ratings for NTRS and its operating company's subordinated debt and preferred stock are sensitive to any change in NTRS' VR. LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSITS The long- and short-term deposit ratings for the Northern Trust Company are sensitive to any change to NTRS' Long- and Short-Term IDR. HOLDING COMPANY Fitch could notch the holding company's ratings from the operating company's ratings if holding company liquidity were to deteriorate, and raise concerns relative to the parent's ability to meet its obligations. Fitch has affirmed the following ratings: Northern Trust Corporation --Long-Term IDR at 'AA-'; Outlook Stable; --Long-term Senior Unsecured Debt at 'AA-'; --Short-Term IDR at 'F1+'; --Short-Term Commercial Paper at 'F1+'; --Viability at 'aa-'; --Subordinated Debt at 'A+'; --Preferred Stock at 'BBB'; --Support at '5'; --Support Floor at 'NF'.

At the meeting of the NATO-Russia Council in Brussels, NATO ambassadors will press Moscow for Russian pilots to file flight plans, respond to air traffic control or identify themselves with cockpit transmitters, known as transponders.   There have been a series of unsafe intercepts,  a NATO official said of Russian pilots.  Risk reduction remains a concern.  The Kremlin says all Russian flights over the Baltic are conducted in strict accordance with international law. Wrangling in the Baltic Sea between Moscow and the Western alliance is intensifying. In June, Russia scrambled a jet to intercept a nuclear-capable U.S. B-52 bomber it said was flying over the Baltic, in an incident that had echoes of the Cold War. NATO said last month it tracked three Russian aircraft over the sea, including two jets which it said did not respond to air traffic control or requests to identify themselves. Russia says the incident involved a NATO F-16 fighter jet buzzing a plane carrying Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu as it flew over the Baltic and that the F-16 was seen off by a Russian Sukhoi-27 military jet.  The NATO-Russia Council, the forum bringing together NATO ambassadors and Russia's top diplomat to the U.S.-led alliance, is seen as a means to prevent tensions escalating, even when joint exercises and peacekeeping have been suspended. At the meeting, Russia's envoy to the alliance, Alexander Grushko, is expected to discuss the issue, as well as the conflict in eastern Ukraine that has killed more than 10,000 people since April 2014. NATO accuses Moscow of direct support for the separatists and for supplying weapons and troops. Russia denies any involvement and says the conflict is more akin to a civil war. The meeting of the Council is only the fifth since the crisis in Ukraine halted regular talks in 2014 and is also set to discuss planned military exercises in the coming months. Russia and Belarus aim to hold joint war games in September that some North Atlantic Treaty Organisation allies believe could number more than 100,000 troops and involve nuclear weapons training, the biggest such exercise since 2013.

Key Points: * Yellen: Interest rates are rising, and  would not have to rise all that much further  to reach what the Fed considers a neutral rate Comments: RICHARD SCALONE, CO-HEAD OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TJM BROKERAGE, CHICAGO  It was a little bit more dovish than most had thought. She said rates won't have to rise much further to get to neutral, I thought that was key. She said inflation response to economy is a key uncertainty, alluding to the inflation again, part of the dovishness. She said inflation running below goal, has declined recently, that's certainly not a hawkish statement. So I think if you put everything together on an overall basis it was somewhat dovish.   At the end of the day, the emphasis on inflation and the fact that it’s not moving in the desired direction is why I think people would look at this as more dovish than hawkish.   The 'additional gradual rate hikes needed,' which was theoretically hawkish, was exactly what everyone knows, based on the dots and the rhetoric that we've seen, so I don't think that was new news, I don't even think that was slightly new news, I think that that's why it was ignored.   It's hard for me to look at this as anything but dovish. I think the kneejerk reaction higher in the dollar was the additional gradual hikes needed, but again on second reading of the same statement, I don't think that's really anything new or surprising. She talked about employment gains early in the testimony, which led to a little bit of a kneejerk strong dollar reaction, but net net the dollar weakening post the release of the prepared comments I think is logical.   I would say if there were 10 headline comments, the fact that three or four of them were geared towards inflation, I think again emphasizes the point that they're not thrilled with the current level of inflation and the direction that it seems to be heading in.   The fact that U.S. interest rates are lower as a derivative of this speech, that's much better for EM and commonwealth currencies, so the peso, the South African rand, Turkish lira, Russian ruble, are probably the best performers on the day, and right behind them is the Aussie and the kiwi, so higher yielders globally are really doing well and enjoying the fact that the U.S. doesn't look like it's going to prick the bubble anytime soon.  JIM VOGEL, INTEREST RATE STRATEGIST, FTN FINANCIAL, MEMPHIS, TENNESSEE  The emphasis on inflation uncertainty has been in Fed discussions for a bit, that she put it into her prepared remarks elevates it for the market. The inflation theme that ruled June got totally overruled by European Central Bank thinking, but the inflation facts never really went away. If nothing else Yellen's comments remind people that inflation has yet to play out precisely as the Fed has forecasted. Given the expectation that almost every major central banker was leaning towards hawkish, the prepared remarks don't sound particularly hawkish. This raises the stakes for Friday's CPI number. It's surprised to the downside for three months, by a lot on a cumulative basis, so people are going to be very anxious to see if that was just a statistical glitch or something that was short lived, or if it's going to continue for a couple more months.  PAUL NOLTE, PORTFOLIO MANAGER AT KINGSVIEW ASSET MANAGEMENT IN CHICAGO      It's surprising to see the markets race like they did. I'm not very surprised by Yellen's comments. She's been pretty steadfast that we're raising rates. The market is liking the fact that she's seeing economic growth.   What the Fed's doing and she's doing is continuing the case for raising rates. The history of the Fed no matter who's been governor is that they'll raise rates until the economy breaks. Not one has raised rates and said OK we're done. It always leads to a recession. I think it's a fallacy that they have to raise rates so they can cut them in a recession.

Governor John Mangudya said the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe was in talks with an unnamed creditor for a loan to underpin the extra notes, which are needed to counter a shortage of U.S. dollars that is crippling the economy.  We are in the process of negotiating those facilities and then we'll come back to yourselves after we have made significant progress,  he told reporters after a lecture at the University of Zimbabwe. He declined to give more details. Zimbabwe abandoned its own currency in 2009 in favour of the U.S. dollar to end hyperinflation, which had hit 500 billion percent the year before. At the time, Zimbabweans were buying loaves of bread with wads of Z$100 trillion notes. However, faced with acute dollar shortages, it introduced the bond notes in November, in an attempt to boost the amount of cash in day-to-day circulation. The notes are scrip, supposedly backed by U.S. dollars loaned to the government, and can be used like cash. Officially, they are pegged to the dollar at a rate of 1:1, but on the street $1 fetches up to 1.20 in bond notes. The central bank denied the notes were a back-door reintroduction of the discredited Zimbabwe dollar, saying they were backed by a $200 million loan from the Cairo-based Afreximbank, a development bank. It also pledged not to exceed the $200 million limit. Afreximbank has not confirmed the existence of the loan and declined to comment on Mangudya's remarks. Without proper reserves to back them up, the bond notes have no intrinsic value and will be prone to sudden and violent devaluation. The IMF said last week the notes and a rise in bank deposits not backed by dollars were already fuelling inflation, now forecast to reach 9.6 percent next year.  What the Reserve Bank is doing amounts to money printing. Bond notes are not going to resolve the cash shortages because people lack confidence in the system and they will not keep money in the bank,  Harare-based economist John Robertson said. The central bank's website says it has issued more than $160 million in bond notes to date. But cash shortages continue, with banks limiting daily withdrawals to as little as $20. The opposition People's Democratic Party, led by former finance minister Tendai Biti, blamed  fiscal indiscipline  on the part of President Robert Mugabe's administration and said the situation could get worse.  Instead of extending the bond note facility the state must scrap it,  the party said in a statement.

Funds including Marshall Wace have waited months for Carillion's value to fall, finally hitting the jackpot when the support services and construction company's stock slid almost 63 percent between Friday's close and Wednesday. A profit warning from Carillion over customer payments owed that it could no longer expect it would be able to collect led to a 845 million pound ($1.1 billion) writedown, prompted its boss to quit and triggered worries about a rights issue. The stock, which was the most heavily shorted on the London market, ended the prior week at 192 pence. The  short  trade by Marshall Wace and others involves borrowing Carillion shares and selling them on into the market in the expectation the price will fall, at which point they can be bought back and returned at a profit. Of 17 outstanding shorts against Carillion as of Wednesday at 0900 GMT, Marshall Wace held the largest position at 3.7 percent of the company's outstanding stock, data from the Financial Conduct Authority showed. That means the hedge fund run by Paul Marshall and Ian Wace could have made 19.1 million pounds over the past three days across its TOPS computer-driven and Global Opportunities funds if they have held onto their stake. BlackRock Investment Management enjoyed the next-biggest return on paper over the same time period, more than 16 million pounds across several funds. Other funds belonging to the U.S. fund giant collectively hold 32 million shares betting on a price rise, Thomson Reuters data showed. Fellow London-based hedge funds set to reap the rewards of the fall include Thunderbird Partners - launched with $1.5 billion in spring 2015 - whose gains would be 14.5 million pounds, and Michael Sidhom's Immersion Capital, which could make 11.4 million pounds. Spokesmen for both declined to comment. Naya Capital, meanwhile, made 7.6 million pounds. A spokesman at London-based Naya declined to comment.

Michel Barnier, who holds a first full round of talks next week, betrayed impatience with London during a Brussels news conference. Britain had yet to respond to detailed proposals from him on many issues, he said, and had fallen short on what it has offered on citizens' rights, as well as on what it owes. Asked his view on Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson's remark on Tuesday that Brussels could  go whistle  if it thought Britain would pay what Johnson called  extortionate  demands, Barnier showed no desire to join in any cross-Channel banter:  I'm not hearing any whistling, just the clock ticking,  the Frenchman said, echoing his refrain of the past year that time is tight to conclude terms for an exit in March 2019 that can limit disruption for businesses and millions of people. Barnier said he wants detailed proposals from the British next week to match those made by the EU on issues they want settled in a withdrawal treaty. These include the rights of expats left on either side of a new EU-UK border, a methodology for calculating how much Britain will owe to cover commitments to the EU and how to manage the new border, notably on Ireland. Only if there is progress on all three of these would EU leaders agree to open negotiations on a future free trade deal. For now, however, 3 million Europeans in Britain would have fewer rights under London's proposal than Britons on the continent, notably in the matter of being able to bring in relatives, he said. And those rights in Britain would not be guaranteed by the treaty or ultimately by the EU's judges in Luxembourg. European Union's chief Brexit negotiator Michael Barnier addresses a news conference at the EU Commission headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, July 12, 2017.Francois LenoirNegotiating Positions Even some EU governments concede that the demand for much of the relations between Britain and the bloc to be under ultimate scrutiny by the European Court of Justice - anathema to many of those who voted for Brexit a year ago - is a  maximalist  position and may have to be moderated in negotiations. Slideshow (2 Images)An early indication of how far apart the two sides really are will come from Monday, when British officials are due in Brussels for the first of four, week-long, monthly rounds of negotiations which they hope can show enough progress to see EU leaders agree at a summit in mid-October to open trade talks. Barnier urged London to be clear on its willingness to pay a bill, which the EU executive have put at potentially 60 billion euros ($70 billion), if it wants to win the Union's trust. He dismissed suggestions from Brexit supporters that the EU was holding Britain to  ransom  and stressed that he was open to negotiating the amount  line by line  but first the British had clearly to take responsibility for their share of EU budgets.  I cannot imagine that a very great country like the United Kingdom is not a country that takes responsibility,  he said. In a sign of the domestic dramas that have delayed Britain's response, three leaders will separately see Barnier on Thursday: the first ministers of Wales, which backed Brexit, and Scotland, which did not, as well as opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn. With May hobbled by losses in a miscued snap election last month, Corbyn's Labour party and the devolved governments are pushing her to modify her Brexit plans - though Barnier stressed he would only be negotiating with British ministers.

However, a clearly stated dividend policy and leverage target improve transparency regarding the company's capital structure. Play's Long-Term IDR is currently 'BB-'/Stable. The company's National Long-Term Rating is 'BBB-(pol)'/Stable. The key changes to our forecasts include the planned PLN650 million 2018 dividend and we expect dividends to grow in line with a targeted payout of 65%-75% of free cash flow-to-equity post lease payments. While this results in a lowering of our post-dividend free cash-flow forecast, we believe underlying growth in the business is sufficiently robust to ensure that funds from operations (FFO) adjusted net leverage stays well below the downgrade threshold of 4.5x. We expect P4 to end 2017 with FFO-adjusted net leverage at around 3.7x and for this metric to trend gradually towards 3.5x by 2019. FFO-adjusted net leverage at/or below 3.5x, together with a strong operational performance, sustained profitability and good cash-flow generation, could result in positive rating action. A key benefit of a successful IPO is the clarity it will bring in terms of P4's capital structure and the future direction of leverage - the company is targeting a net debt / EBITDA leverage of 2.5x. Since 2014, Play has twice recapitalised via a holdco PIK note. The most recent example in March this year saw the group refinance an existing EUR415 million layer of PIK debt, regarded as outside the borrower group, into the senior debt capital structure. The existence of PIK debt therefore, even when outside the borrower group, typically raises expectations or risk of a leverage spike as and when the instrument is refinanced. Ownership questions at Play, particularly whether the existing owners might seek to sell on to another private equity investor, have also led to uncertainty over future leverage. These uncertainties have in the past acted as a constraint to the ratings of a business where underlying performance was otherwise stronger than the ratings assigned.

Carillion, which has worked on projects ranging from London's Tate Modern gallery to the Twickenham Rugby stadium, announced huge provisions on problem contacts on Monday, leading its chief executive to step down and its shares to plummet by more than two thirds in three days. The stock hit a new low of 57.25 pence on Wednesday on speculation the company, which employs around 48,500 people, may seek to raise money via a big share sale. If that proves too difficult, or insufficient, Carillion might have to consider a debt restructuring, bankers and analysts said. The company, which was demerged from the Tarmac group in 1999 and went on to buy construction firm Alfred McAlpine, has said it is considering all options to cut debt. Owners of Carillion's convertible bonds - debt instruments that can be swapped into shares under certain conditions - could demand a cash payment in exchange for forgiving some of the company's debt, said a banker who was among the arrangers of the original bond sale.  Investors are more shocked at the moment than anything. Eventually if the situation doesn't stabilise, they will look to sell, but who will buy it?  said the banker.  In the end, a write off of the debt in exchange for getting part of the nominal value in cash is the most likely outcome, assuming the situation with the company does not stabilise.  In an extreme case, they may even push to convert the bonds into shares in order to recoup at least some of their investment, he added.  They will have losses, but at least they can monetise shares, whereas the convertible bonds will be very difficult to get rid of,  he said. Carillion's average net borrowing in the first of the year was 695 million pounds ($896 million), substantially higher than its current market value. The company sold 170 million pounds of five-year convertible bonds in December 2014, paying out a coupon of 2.50 percent and making up more than half of its outstanding bonds, according to Reuters data. If converted, the bonds would represent about 11 percent of the company's outstanding shares. Sources close to the situation pointed to French oil services firm CGG as a recent example of a debt restructuring involving convertible bonds. In March, CGG started talks with the bondholders to try and agree a proposal that involves conversion of bonds into shares and a rights issue thereafter. <bit.ly/2vcoqds > $1 = 0.7760 pounds Editing by Mark Potter","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/carillion-bonds-idUSL8N1K3341"},

James-Todd, a professor at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston, was not involved with the new research. The study of 4,285 African-American and white women was the first to find a significant increase in breast cancer risk among black women who used dark shades of hair dye and white women who used chemical relaxers.  Black women who reported using dark hair dye had a 51 percent increased risk of breast cancer compared to black women who did not, while white women who reported using chemical relaxers had a 74 percent increased risk of breast cancer, the study found. The risk of breast cancer was even higher for white women who regularly dyed their hair dark shades and also used chemical relaxers, and it more than doubled for white dual users compared to white women who used neither dark dye nor chemical straighteners. The association between relaxers and breast cancer in white women surprised lead author Adana Llanos, an epidemiologist at the Rutgers School of Public Health in Piscataway, New Jersey, although she worried enough about the safety of hair relaxers in African-American women like herself to stop using them years ago. “A lot of people have asked me if I’m telling women not to dye their hair or not to use relaxers,” she said in a phone interview. “I’m not saying that. What I think is really important is we need to be more aware of the types of exposures in the products we use.” The study included adult women from New York and New Jersey, surveyed from 2002 through 2008, who had been diagnosed with breast cancer, plus women of similar age and race but without a history of cancer. Women were asked if they had ever used permanent hair dye at least twice a year for at least a year. They were also asked if they had ever chemically relaxed or straightened their hair for at least a year. While the vast majority - 88 percent - of blacks had used chemicals to relax their hair, only 5 percent of whites reported using relaxers. For dark hair dye, the numbers flipped, though the differences were not as dramatic. While 58 percent of whites said they regularly dyed their hair dark shades, only 30 percent of blacks did. The most striking results showed increased risk in the minority of black women who used dark hair dye and white women who used chemical relaxers.  Black women who used chemical straighteners and white women who used dark hair dyes were also at higher risk for breast cancer, but that might have been due to chance. James-Todd said that because so many of the black women used chemical relaxers and so many of the white women used dark hair dye, links would have been hard to detect. There’s no reason to believe that chemical relaxers and hair dyes would increase the risk for women of one race and not of another, she said. She believes the association stems not from genetics but from cultural norms. It could also boil down to products, and women from different cultures might use different straighteners and dyes. But the study did not ask women to specify the products they used.  The study included the largest population of African-American women thus far examined for breast cancer risk and dark hair dye, according to the research team. Previous studies have shown that long-term users of dark dyes have a four-fold increased risk of fatal non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and fatal multiple myeloma, the authors write. Prior research also has associated dark hair dye use with an increased risk of bladder cancer. A 2016 report from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that breast cancer rates are generally similar for black and white women, at around 122 new cases for every 100,000 women per year, although black women with the disease are more likely to die from it.

The European Union's sanctions, painfully negotiated by all 28 EU governments in 2014 and so far renewed every six months, are the bloc's toughest response to Russia's annexation of Crimea and its support for separatists in eastern Ukraine.  But it is up to each EU government to enforce them and they do not apply to companies' Russian subsidiaries, making any possible wrongdoing very hard to prove. Reuters reported on July 5 that two electricity turbines made by Siemens were shipped to the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea, which is subject to EU sanctions that ban EU firms from supplying energy technology there. Siemens said the turbines were transferred to Crimea without its knowledge and against its will.  Implementation and enforcement of EU restrictive measures rests with the member states,  a spokesman for the European Commission said in response to the Siemens case.  The Commission is in touch with the German competent authorities on this particular case,  the spokesman said, referring to Siemens. Still, economic sanctions on Russia, including those on Crimea, have deterred many EU firms from doing business there. EU exports to Russia fell by 40 percent between 2013 and 2016 to 72 billion euros ($82.09 billion), according to the EU's statistics office Eurostat. Direct investment by the European Union's 28 countries into Russia fell 18 percent to 162 billion euros between 2013 and 2015, the latest data available.  The reputational damage of a potential sanctions breach can be enormous,  said Maya Lester, a London-based barrister and author of a European sanctions website.  One practical effect of imposing sanctions can be about sending a message, as well as the restrictions themselves, and compliance is a big issue too.   Overall, the European Union has imposed sanctions banning most EU business with Crimea, has frozen the assets and prohibited travel for Russians linked to the Ukraine crisis and has limited EU investment in Russia's defense and energy sectors. Financing to Russian banks is severely restricted. Unlike the United States, which has robust economic and trade sanctions enforcement through its Office of Foreign Assets Control at the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the European Union has no single such agency. While the EU's institutions in Brussels are instrumental in drawing up the legal language for the punitive regime and drumming up diplomatic support for them, the few dozen experts who help design them do not have the resources to enforce them.  Theatrical rhetoric is not matched by enforcement,  said Tom Keatinge, director of financial crime studies at RUSI think-tank in London.  They have become symbolic,  he said, saying not enough was done to update sanctions to avoid both EU and Russian companies circumventing them. FILE PHOTO: A general view shows a power plant under construction in Sevastopol, Crimea, July 5, 2017.Anton Zverev /File PhotoA Sept. 2016 investigation by Reuters showed that at least two European retailers, Auchan and Metro, were active on the Crimean market through Russian subsidiaries, shipping there from Russia via a ferry and port that are subject to EU sanctions. Furthermore, France last year granted Russian Agriculture Minister Alexander Tkachev a visa even though he has been banned from entering the EU since 2014 because of Crimea. No Database In April, Britain moved to a U.S.-style enforcement policy to allow civil fines of at least 1 million pounds ($1.28 million) on breaches of financial sanctions. FILE PHOTO: Saftey helmets are piled up for media representatives at the Siemens AG gas turbine factory hall in Berlin, Germany, November 8, 2012.Tobias Schwarz/File PhotoHowever, Britain has not so far prosecuted any company for any potential breach of sanctions, Lester said. It was not immediately clear if other EU countries have brought criminal proceedings because no public database exists of sanctions breaches. Many EU countries rely on different agencies, from the central bank to the export licensing authority, to enforce measures. Refusal of licenses can be challenged in court, while customs offices and the public prosecutor are responsible for violations of export controls. EU officials have designed sanctions to be as specific as possible to avoid hurting the wider population, making loopholes easier to find. EU companies are expected to adhere to what EU officials call  the spirit  of the sanctions regime but it does not apply directly to their subsidiaries incorporated in Russia.   If the sanctions are too wide ranging, they may be too disruptive to the EU, or contribute to a financial crisis,  said Erica Moret, chair of the Geneva International Sanctions Network at the Graduate Institute Geneva.  The human costs of blanket sanctions have been too great in the past.  EU governments also want the measures to be able to be lifted quickly in case of a rapprochement with Russia. Defence, energy and financial sanctions could be removed if all sides implement the Minsk peace deal involving the withdrawal of troops and weaponry from eastern Ukraine. Russian denies any direct involvement in the conflict that has killed more than 10,000 people since April 2014.

Ratings agency Moody's said in a statement late on Tuesday that the United Kingdom's creditworthiness was under pressure following last year's vote to leave the EU and the ongoing uncertainty over the outcome of negotiations with Brussels. That comes at a time when the Conservative government is under pressure, following the shock loss of its majority last month. The likely next leader of the pro-EU Liberal Democrats, Vince Cable, said on Tuesday that Britain was heading towards a new economic crisis which could raise popular support for anti-Brexit parties. At the same time, economic indicators have suggested Britain is already struggling to gain momentum after a sluggish start to the year, while consumer and business sentiment has soured. Amid the resulting falls for the pound, several of the Bank of England's monetary policy panel stepped in to warn it may raise rates soon, temporarily lifting the currency before it slipped back.        I really have not liked sterling for a while,  said State Street's head of macro strategy for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, Tim Graf.  The consumer is not taking up the slack as... previously.    The only thing that has been supporting the pound is the idea that the BoE might hike rates. If we continue to see (weak data), I can't see how they can.   August Hike  Unrealistic ? BoE Deputy Governor Ben Broadbent said in a newspaper interview published on Wednesday he was  not ready  to raise rates yet, driving sterling to a two-week low against the dollar and 8-month low against the euro  in early trade before the labour market report improved the mood. [nL8N1K31PX] The data showed British workers saw their pay fall further behind inflation in the three months to May, though wages rose marginally more than had been expected.  For anyone who had any expectation of an August hike - that is clearly looking very unrealistic now,  said MUFG analyst Lee Hardman, while adding:  He does reinforce that they are moving towards a hike. That will help keep alive expectations for a move later this year.  By 1210 GMT, the pound was trading 0.2 percent stronger on the day at $1.2873, having earlier weakened to $1.2812. It also gained 0.4 percent to 88.91 pence per euro.  Sterling fell back to as low as $1.26 in the two weeks after Prime Minister Theresa May unexpectedly lost her parliamentary majority in last month's snap election, but it remains some 10 cents above lows hit in a flash crash last October.  Top executives at five of the largest banks in London told Reuters a staggered deal on leaving the European Union is only likely to be agreed late on in talks with Brussels, meaning they have already begun relocating staff. With those sorts of Brexit-related blows potentially in store for the months ahead, many economists say the British economy is far from ready to deal with higher interest rates and much recent data continues to weigh against the pound.  However, Nomura strategist Jordan Rochester, one of the market's most prominent sterling bulls, predicted the currency would reach $1.37 by the end of this year.  He said Broadbent's words still left room for officials to opt at the August meeting to remove the extra emergency stimulus given to the economy after the Brexit vote last year. That would prod interest rates back to 0.5 percent and offer some support to the pound.

Silver demand from photography slid from more than 7,000 tonnes a year in the late 1990s to just 45 tonnes last year. The use of platinum-heavy fuel cell technology in the electric car market is growing much too slowly to offset falling autocatalyst demand, Albrecht said.  The following are edited excerpts from the conversation:       Q: Morgan Stanley recently said their base case for electric vehicle uptake was for 47 percent of new cars to be battery electric by 2050. How do you expect the market for fuel cell cars to look by then?  A: This outlook may be pessimistic. I believe we will see a tipping point towards electrification by 2040 at the latest. As to fuel cell cars, I think the race in the light vehicle sector has been lost to battery electric. It's a  Betamax  moment.  Q: Is the biggest barrier to greater uptake the lack of infrastructure?  A: Yes. Either technology, hydrogen electric or battery electric, only makes sense if the energy used is produced in a sustainable, non-polluting way. Large solar farms are needed for both.  Q: Can fuel cells replace falling platinum demand from car producers for diesel catalysts in the upcoming years?  A: I'm afraid not. If you keep in mind that 40 percent of all platinum and 75 percent of all palladium and rhodium are currently used in emission control catalysts, hydrogen fuel cells will not be able to make up for this quantity.  Q: How much could be replaced approximately?  A: My guess would be 10-20 percent of car industry demand. Q: How much platinum demand do you expect fuel cells to account for in a decade's time?  A: There will be virtually no noticeable impact on platinum markets from this application. Rather than looking at the opportunity of hydrogen electric technology, what we should be concerned about is the replacement of platinum group metals by battery electric technologies. The impact on the precious metals industry will be massive.  Q: How much demand could be lost in this sector, in your view, and over what sort of timescale?  A: We could lose literally all of the quantities mentioned in world consumption - 40 percent of platinum, 75 percent of palladium and rhodium. It will shake the industry more than the collapse of silver photography. Time frame? Some say as early as 2023, others say 2040. The truth will be somewhere in the middle. Not long either way.

The Supreme Court ruled unanimously that John Walker's husband was entitled to a spouse pension and that the law was discriminatory, making Britain one of few countries to provide equal access to pension benefits for same-sex couples.  I am absolutely thrilled at today's ruling, which is a victory for basic fairness and decency,  Walker said in a statement following a five-year court battle.   Finally this absurd injustice has been consigned to the history books – and my husband and I can now get on with enjoying the rest of our lives together,  he added. Britain legalized same-sex marriage in 2014 but a legal loophole allowed an employer to refuse to pay pension benefits to a former employee's partner if they were in a civil partnership or same-sex marriage and had paid into their pension fund before December 2005. This meant if Walker was married to a woman, or married a woman in the future, his spouse would receive about 45,000 pounds ($58,000) a year after his death. Walker's same-sex partner, before the ruling, would have received 1,000 pounds. Walker, 65, and his husband have been together since 1993. The Supreme Court ruling stated the law was incompatible with European Union (EU) anti-discrimination laws and overturned it with immediate effect. The judgment stated that E.U. legislation had transformed the status of gay and lesbian employees in Britain, raising concerns that legal protections would weaken after Britain's exit from the bloc.  This ruling was made under EU law and is a direct consequence of the rights protection the EU gives us,  said Emma Norton, lawyer for rights group Liberty who represented Walker.  We now risk losing that protection. The government must promise that there will be no rollback on LGBT rights after Brexit – and commit to fully protecting them in UK law.

The labor bill was passed in a 50 to 26 vote following approval in the lower house of Congress and will be sent to Temer to be signed into law.     The changes, which were opposed by trade unions, give more leeway to collective bargaining and reduce the scope for legal action in labor disputes.     Investors see them as crucial to lift long-term growth in Latin America's largest economy, as part of a package of structural reforms that also includes measures to streamline Brazil's bloated pension system.     The Brazilian real strengthened 0.6 percent, while Brazil's benchmark Bovespa stock index advanced 0.4 percent. Wide lawmaker support for the labor bill eased investor fears that a mounting corruption scandal might have damaged the outlook for Temer's agenda.      Shares of state-controlled oil company Petróleo Brasileiro SA led gains in the index after its board approved an initial public offering of shares for its fuel distribution unit.     A ruling by regulator CVM to reverse an earlier decision ordering Petrobras, as the company is known, to restate financial statements in recent years also fueled demand for its stocks.     Other Latin American markets also traded higher after Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen indicated that the U.S. central bank may raise interest rates less than previously suggested.     In a prepared testimony to be delivered to Congress, Yellen said interest rates  would not have to rise all that much further  to reach what the Fed considers a neutral rate. A slower pace of rate hikes would increase the allure of high-yielding emerging market assets.

The Rating Outlook remains Stable. A full list of rating actions follows at the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS IDRs, VRs AND SENIOR DEBT The affirmation of State Street's ratings reflects its strong franchise in asset custody, growing position in asset management, stable operating performance, and relatively conservative overall balance sheet posture. The company's high ratings continue to be supported primarily by its business model which Fitch believes benefits from scale economies and possess high barriers to entry. Ratings are further bolstered by the company's good funding profile, consisting mainly of institutional custody deposits that Fitch considers to be core in nature. While business models with high barriers to entry such as State Street's typically result in some pricing power in its core business, the scale economies of the trust and processing business have resulted in oligopolistic price competition. Those firms with the best operating model and cost structure are better able to withstand pricing pressures in the core custody business. As such, State Street's management continues to work on streamlining the company's businesses and driving operational excellence through the use of technology and automation. This effort was initially dubbed the Ops and IT Transformation Program (Ops & IT) and has continued in a newer initiative named Project Beacon (Beacon). Beacon aims to achieve $550 million in annual operating cost savings by 2020. Management reports that the program has already realized $175 million in savings in 2016 and expects to achieve at least $140 million in additional pre-tax net expense savings in 2017. Fitch believes these savings will allow State Street to partially offset revenue associated lost with the $1 trillion in assets under custody that its large client BlackRock plans to transfer to JP Morgan (JPM) over the next five years. The savings will also help State Street generate more significant operating leverage should short-term interest rates continue to rise. State Street's earnings remain sensitive to higher short-term interest rates. Since the Federal Reserve began rising interest rates late in 2015, State Street's net interest margin (NIM) has risen from a low of 1.01% at the end of 2015 to 1.17% and the end of the first quarter of 2017 (1Q17). Further, State Street indicates that its net income will increase by an additional $514 million, or 24% of annual net income, should short-term interest rates rise by 100 basis points in a parallel shock. Over the last few years, State Street's stated return on average equity (ROAE) has hovered just below 10%. To the extent that short-term rates continue to rise and State Street's earnings rise by the amount indicated above, Fitch expects the company's ROAE could approach 11%, all else equal. This would be closer to its longer-term averages and above various estimates of the company's cost of equity. In this scenario State Street's overall operating margin would be solidly above its historical levels of 30%, and net interest income (NII) as a percentage of total revenue would be in the low-20% range, well above the 19% contribution to total revenue at 1Q17. At the same time, State Street has also worked to build out its asset management offerings with the closing of the purchase of General Electric's (GE) asset management business in July 2016. This added $100 billion of assets under management (AUM) at a cost of $485 million but also importantly adds fundamental asset management capabilities to State Street's asset management platform that has historically been more quantitatively oriented. Fitch believes the recurring nature of asset management revenue and the low balance sheet usage of this business enhances the franchise by adding more diversity and stability to the overall business model. Additionally, State State's asset management business continues to benefit from the shift to passively managed investment products from actively managed products. Further supporting State Street's rating is the company's strong funding position. Custody deposits, which Fitch considers core in nature, constitute 85% of State Street's liabilities as of 1Q17. Additionally given that these deposits continue to be invested predominantly in high credit quality and low duration securities suggests State Street's balance sheet is relatively low risk, further supporting the company's high ratings. As such, Fitch considers the company to be appropriately capitalized for the risk of the balance sheet. As of 1Q17, State Street's fully phased-in Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Ratio 10.9%, unchanged from the end of 2016. Similarly its Fitch Core Capital Ratio was 10.4% at 1Q17, also essentially unchanged from the end of 2016. Fitch believes, however, that State Street's more binding capital ratio is the Enhanced Supplementary Leverage Ratio (ESLR) which goes into effect on Jan. 1, 2018. State Street estimates that on a fully phased-in pro forma basis, its ESLR was 6% at the parent company and 6.5% at the main operating bank as of 1Q17, both already above regulatory minimums. Fitch expects State Street to continue to aggressively optimize its deposit base away from non-operational wholesale deposits in order to maintain ESLR compliance and potentially reduce the recently finalized Global Systemically Important Bank (GSIB) surcharge of 150 basis points. DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTY RATINGS (DCR) The DCRs are at the same level as the respective entities' Long-Term IDRs because they have no definitive preferential status over other senior obligations in a resolution scenario. SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANY SSBT's rating is one notch above the parent company's Long-Term IDR, reflecting the implementation of total loss absorbing capital (TLAC) requirements for U.S. Global Systemically Important Banks (GSIBs). The Viability Ratings (VRs) remain equalized between State Street and its material operating subsidiaries, namely SSBT. The common VR of State Street and its operating companies reflects the correlated performance or failure rate between State Street and these subsidiaries. SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR The Support Ratings (SR) of '5' and Support Rating Floors (SRF) of 'No Floor' reflect Fitch's view that senior creditors can no longer rely on receiving full extraordinary support from the sovereign in the event that State Street becomes non-viable. SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES Subordinated debt and other hybrid capital issued by State Street and by various issuing vehicles are all notched down from its VR or those of its bank subsidiaries in accordance with Fitch's assessment of each instrument's respective non-performance and relative loss severity risk profiles. Subordinated debt is notched one notch down from the VR, and preferred stock is notched down five notches from the VR. Capital trust securities have been notched down four notches from the VR. LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSITS SSBT's Deposit ratings are one notch higher than the entity's IDR and senior debt reflecting the deposits' superior recovery prospects in case of default given depositor preference in the U.S. RATING SENSITIVITIES IDRs, VRs AND SENIOR DEBT State Street's ratings are already near the top of Fitch's global rated bank universe. Thus, Fitch sees limited potential for upwards ratings momentum. Fitch believes that the main threat to State Street's business model and ratings would result from a large idiosyncratic technological or operational loss resulting in reputational damage that causes clients to leave the firm. State Street has been making significant investments in its technology and automation, which Fitch believes will help to reduce the incidence of potential idiosyncratic events that are prone to cause large losses. While Fitch believes these operational risks have been well monitored and controlled to date, the risks are inherently difficult to predict and quantify. As such, a large occurrence such that it causes a revenue loss of 5% or greater or causes significant reputational damage would likely prompt Fitch to review the ratings to determine if a negative rating action was appropriate. Fitch's analysis also indicates that State Street's earnings and business model may be more sensitive to equity markets than its peer trust and processing banks, which may impact ratings in a period of equity market stress. Should certain regulatory rules incentivize State Street's management to aggressively expand its currently small secured bank loan portfolio such that in Fitch's opinion it alters the agency's view of State Street's balance sheet risk or overall risk posture this could, over time, result in negative ratings pressure. Currently, Fitch does not expect the affirmative BREXIT vote to overly impact State Street's business, but it may change the way the company conducts business with some of its foreign clients. State Street and its peer trust and processing banks are beginning to face risk of potential technological disruption from distributed ledger technology. More commonly referred to as  blockchain , it is an electronic means of settling, reconciling, and reporting on client transactions, which is the core business of State Street and its peer banks. Fitch believes it is highly probable that State Street and its peer trust and processing banks will work to harness this technology to drive efficiencies across their respective platforms. However, it's also possible that over a long period of time a new entrant could offer an alternative distributed ledger solution that potentially disrupts the trust banks' business and erodes their barriers to entry, which would be viewed negatively from a rating perspective. At present, Fitch views this risk as well outside of the Rating Outlook horizon. DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTY RATINGS DCRs are primarily sensitive to changes in the respective issuers' Long-Term IDRs. In addition, they could be upgraded to one notch above the IDR if a change in legislation (for example as recently proposed in the EU) creates legal preference for derivatives over certain other senior obligations and if Fitch then believes the volume of all legally subordinated obligations provides a substantial enough buffer to protect derivative counterparties from default in a resolution scenario. SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR Any upward revision to the SR and SRF would be contingent on a positive change in the U.S.'s propensity to support its banks. While not impossible, Fitch views this as highly unlikely. SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES State Street's subordinated debt ratings are broadly sensitive to the same considerations that might affect the company's VR. SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANIES Given that SSBT's and State Street's VRs remain equalized, SSBT's ratings are broadly sensitive to the same considerations that would affect State Street's VR. LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSITS The ratings of SSBT's long- and short-term deposits of SSBT primarily sensitive to any change in State Street's IDR. Should State Street Corporation's IDR be downgraded, the deposit ratings could be similarly impacted Fitch has affirmed the following ratings: State Street Corporation --Long-Term IDR at 'AA-'; Outlook Stable; --Derivative Counterparty Rating at 'AA-(dcr)'; --Short-Term IDR at 'F1+'; --Support at '5'; --Support Rating Floor at 'NF'; --Viability rating at 'aa-'; --Junior subordinated debt at 'BBB+'; --Commercial paper at 'F1+'; --Preferred stock at 'BBB'; --Long-Term senior debt at 'AA-'; --Long-Term subordinated notes at 'A+'.

The world number four has yet to win a tournament in a year disrupted by injury, erratic form, new clubs, his own wedding and most recently a social media spat that led him to temporarily withdrawing from Twitter. But the 28-year-old four-times major winner said he remained in positive mood ahead of a busy few weeks which will see him contest the Scottish Open at Dundonald, which starts on Thursday, and then the British Open a week later. Describing his last few months as  transitional , McIlroy said:  It's hard to sit up here and stand in front of a camera every single time and say to you guys: 'It's close', because I sound a bit like a broken record after a few weeks. But really, it's not far away.  I felt like the 2016 season didn't really go the way I wanted (but) I'm positive about it. I'm excited about my game. I feel like I'm doing a lot of good things. It's just putting it all together, not just for one day but for four days; and not just for four days, to do it week in and week out,  he told Britain's Guardian newspaper.  Look, I've got a busy summer coming up. I'm potentially playing seven weeks out of eight or seven weeks out of nine. I might be putting a bit too much pressure on myself, but I know that it's coming around. But I need to see it happen sooner, rather than later.  There were no signs of improvement at last week's Irish Open, hosted by the Rory Foundation at Portstewart, where he was upstaged by Spain's Jon Rahm with the sort of barnstorming performance that the Irishman once trademarked.  I'm trying to stay patient but it's proving difficult,  he said.   It always has been for me. Because I feel like I am good enough to win these tournaments, and I've shown that before,  said McIlroy, who hit unremarkable rounds of 72 and 73 at the Irish Open.  On Wednesday, he spent 90 minutes working on his putting at the practice greens, admitting that he is looking to regain his rhythm after becoming bogged down by  technical thoughts . At the Scottish Open, McIlroy will look to emulate 2014 when his last tournament appearance prefaced his British Open win at Royal Liverpool, just up coast from this year's venue of Royal Birkdale.   There is still plenty of time to salvage the season,  he said.  But I’d rather see that happen sooner, rather than later.

Silver demand from photography slid from more than 7,000 tonnes a year in the late 1990s to just 45 tonnes last year. The use of platinum-heavy fuel cell technology in the electric car market is growing much too slowly to offset falling autocatalyst demand, Albrecht said.  The following are edited excerpts from the conversation:       Q: Morgan Stanley recently said their base case for electric vehicle uptake was for 47 percent of new cars to be battery electric by 2050. How do you expect the market for fuel cell cars to look by then?  A: This outlook may be pessimistic. I believe we will see a tipping point towards electrification by 2040 at the latest. As to fuel cell cars, I think the race in the light vehicle sector has been lost to battery electric. It's a  Betamax  moment.  Q: Is the biggest barrier to greater uptake the lack of infrastructure?  A: Yes. Either technology, hydrogen electric or battery electric, only makes sense if the energy used is produced in a sustainable, non-polluting way. Large solar farms are needed for both.  Q: Can fuel cells replace falling platinum demand from car producers for diesel catalysts in the upcoming years?  A: I'm afraid not. If you keep in mind that 40 percent of all platinum and 75 percent of all palladium and rhodium are currently used in emission control catalysts, hydrogen fuel cells will not be able to make up for this quantity.  Q: How much could be replaced approximately?  A: My guess would be 10-20 percent of car industry demand. Q: How much platinum demand do you expect fuel cells to account for in a decade's time?  A: There will be virtually no noticeable impact on platinum markets from this application. Rather than looking at the opportunity of hydrogen electric technology, what we should be concerned about is the replacement of platinum group metals by battery electric technologies. The impact on the precious metals industry will be massive.  Q: How much demand could be lost in this sector, in your view, and over what sort of timescale?  A: We could lose literally all of the quantities mentioned in world consumption - 40 percent of platinum, 75 percent of palladium and rhodium.

The study is the first to try to model how non-bank lenders would react in a stressed market environment, with the BoE particularly concerned about the effect on corporate funding rates and their impact on the real economy. The need to model the risk has arisen because capital markets have provided a bigger slice of corporate funding since the financial crisis and many of the often-illiquid bonds are held in mutual funds offering daily exits to investors. With dealers at banks making markets in bonds operating under tougher capital rules and therefore more sensitive to risk than before the crisis, the Bank of England is concerned that they may not be able to absorb panic-selling by investors. The study found that weekly mutual fund redemptions of 1 percent of assets under management -- a level seen during the 2008 crisis -- could increase corporate bond interest rates for companies with high credit ratings by about 40 basis points. But the ability of dealers to absorb those sales could be tested if redemptions are only a third higher, in what the study described as  an unlikely, but not impossible, event .  It is a first -- pilot -- step and so is an incomplete exercise, focusing on one type of stress scenario, one market and simple models of the behavior of important parts of the system,  the central bank said in the report.  Nevertheless, it has allowed a scenario to be explored in which large-scale redemptions from open-ended investment funds trigger sales by those funds, with resulting spillover effects to dealers and hedge funds.  The Bank said it would follow up by examining the role played by pension funds and insurance companies, and would feed into work carried out by peers globally. The results could inform future policy action, though none was recommended.

Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras welcomed the commission's recommendation and said the economy was  steadily returning to European normality,  according to a statement released by his office on Wednesday.   The government will continue focusing on exiting once and for all the bailout program in August 2018,  he said.  Ending the disciplinary procedure, which was widely expected, should help Greece in issuing new bonds in the coming weeks or months.

Often called “C. diff” for short, the bug has typically been considered a problem for very ill hospitalized patients, but it’s increasingly being found outside hospitals, Dr. Jose Blanco of the faculty of Veterinary Medicine at Universidad Complutense de Madrid and colleagues write in the journal Zoonoses and Public Health. Just as squeamish parents might expect, past studies have confirmed that public sandboxes can host disease-causing organisms, including parasites and bacteria. In the new study, Blanco’s team tested sand from 20 sandboxes for children and 20 for dogs in Madrid parks. Twenty-one of the sandboxes tested positive for C. diff. Of these, eight of the samples were toxin-forming strains, the type that causes disease in humans, while the remaining twelve were non-toxigenic.   The findings are not cause for alarm, Blanco told Reuters Health in an email interview. He noted that C. difficile does not sicken children younger than 2 years old. “We have to learn to live with these agents. If our children live in a highly clean environment, their immune system will not be developed in the correct way, and probably, problems like allergy will be present,” he added.  “It is important do not leave organic material in the sandboxes, that could serve as food to different kinds of animals in the night. And also clean the sandboxes of possible animal fecal material (mainly in the morning, before the use by children).” It’s not surprising to find C. difficile in sandboxes, Philip Tierno Jr., a professor of pathology and microbiology at NYU School of Medicine in New York City, told Reuters Health in a telephone interview. Even though the study was done in Spain, he added, “it’s really something that could have been done here because C. difficile is ubiquitous.” Many people, including children, carry the bug without being sick, Tierno said, and it can now even be found in the food supply. The best defense against C. difficile is careful handwashing, before eating and drinking and before touching one’s face, according to Tierno. While soap and water are effective against the germ, he said, alcohol-based sanitizing gels will not kill the bug. Private sandboxes are likely to be relatively clean, but they should be covered when not in use to avoid bacteria and parasites carried by animals like rats and raccoons, Tierno said.  He noted that when he takes his grandchildren to the park, he steers clear of sandboxes. “I don’t see the need,” he said. “I’d rather take my kid to the beach and play with the sand there.” SOURCE: bit.ly/2ueaqTj Zoonoses and Public Health, online July 7, 2017.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-sandboxes-toxic-bacteria-idUSKBN19X1ZH"},

Prevailing after a year-long struggle with hedge funds and private-equity companies it bought the company in 2007 for €1.5bn. It has now launched a refinancing, with Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Macquarie leading the deal, alongside Credit Agricole and UniCredit, the sources said. Macquarie and Techem were not immediately available to comment. A bank meeting is set to take place on July 13 in London to show the deal to investors and commitments are due two weeks afterwards, the sources said. The refinancing includes a €1.6bn term loan, guided to pay 325bp-350bp over Euribor, with a 0% floor at par and a €150m revolving credit facility, the sources said. In an unusual move, the loan will be offered with portability, something more commonly seen in the bond market. Portability allows for a loan to stay in place in event of a sale. Typically a change of ownership triggers a loan repayment. Portability has started to creep into the loan market recently in the case of Dutch gaming firm JVH, which private equity-owner Waterland put up for sale in June after securing a €330m loan financing that can stay in place for any new owners. Techem has been touted as launching a possible sale process later this year. Founded in 1952, Techem is a supplier of energy invoicing and energy management in buildings.

The vividly illustrated e-books in the local Khmer language tell the stories of eight different female characters who overcome challenges through courage and ingenuity under the tagline  Girls Can Do Anything . One story features a girl who invents a flying contraption that looks like a bike with bat-like wings to save her village while another girl fights aliens seeking to destroy her city.  The availability of original storybooks for children in Khmer is limited. Content related to the empowerment of women is even more scarce,  said Edward Anderson from The Asia Foundation, which is running the project.  The books ... can serve as role models for young girls, helping them to break away from traditional subservient expectations and empower them to become leaders,  added Anderson, the acting Cambodia chief for the U.S.-based charity. Cambodia was ranked 112 out of 144 countries in the World Economic Forum's Global Gender Gap 2016, after scoring poorly in political empowerment and education attainment for women. Campaigners say a gap in education persists in the impoverished Southeast Asian nation, with fewer girls attending and completing school, while sexual and labor exploitation remain a serious problem for women. The book series, under a wider initiative known as  Let's Read!  which aims to encourage reading among children, was created by Cambodian writers and illustrators during a  hackathon  event. Prum Kunthearo, one of the eight writers, said it was the first time she had used a female protagonist in a story since she began writing books in 2013.  She said her story  Green Star , about a girl who uses her knowledge of science to help a boy find his way home, was inspired by a lack of women in the science and technology sectors in the nation of 16 million people.  Children should understand the importance of gender equality from an early age,  she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone from Phnom Penh. Illustrator Pors Socheata hoped Cambodian girls would be empowered through the stories.  Most of the characters in our storybooks are males, especially when they are superheroes or have achieved something good,  she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Although the books are only available in digital format for now, The Asia Foundation said it is working with the Cambodian government and companies to promote them, while it explores the possibility of publishing the books in hard copies to distribute to remote parts of the country.

Analysts had previously estimated RBS would have to pay between $3.5 to $5 billion to settle the case with the FHFA.  Today's announcement is an important step forward in resolving one of the most significant legacy matters,  RBS Chief Executive Ross McEwan said in a statement. McEwan has been trying to clean up RBS's balance sheet and end an array of legal cases so the government can sell its more than 70 percent stake in the bank after a 46 billion pound ($59.6 billion) bailout during the financial crisis. RBS said it will get a reimbursement of about $754 million  from other parties and the fine is largely covered by existing provisions.

The prevalence of the malaria parasite in children under five has plunged to 0.2 percent from 4 percent in 2011, according to the National Malaria Control Programme (NMCP). The total number of new malaria cases across the West African nation has fallen by about 40 percent in that time - to 155,450 last year down from 262,000 in 2011, NMCP data shows.  Gambia is aiming to achieve the milestone of having no new malaria cases by 2020, but donor fatigue is a concern with a funding gap of over $25 million, said NMCP head Balla Kandeh.   This last mile is the most difficult - we need more support to sustain the gains we have made yet donors often turn their attention elsewhere as cases drop,  he said, adding that malaria rates in Gambia may rebound if more funding is not secured soon. Kandeh hopes that Gambia's new leadership under President Adama Barrow, who won a December election to bring an end to 22 years of autocratic rule under Yahya Jammeh, will attract back donors after many left during the previous regime.  There is a better working environment under Barrow, with less constraints and less political uncertainty,  he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  The fear of the unknown has gone.   Aside from the usual control measures, such as antimalarial drugs, insecticide-treated bed nets and indoor spraying, Gambia has successfully used technology to tackle malaria, according to Carla Fajardo of aid agency Catholic Relief Services (CRS). Tablets, online platforms and GPS have been used to track delivery of the above strategies, with real-time data enabling decisions to be made on the fly, while internet service providers have boosted bandwidth in remote areas, Fajardo said. The world has made huge strides against malaria since 2000, with death rates plunging by 60 percent and at least six million lives saved globally, the World Health Organization (WHO) says. But efforts to end one of the world's deadliest diseases - which kills about 430,000 people a year, mostly children in sub-Saharan Africa - are under threat as mosquitoes become increasingly resistant to measures such as bed nets and drugs.

The watchdog, known by its Dutch acronym ACM, said it had visited some of the dozens of companies active in fuel production, transportation, storage and trading in Rotterdam, Antwerp and Amsterdam after receiving information from the police. The ACM, which did not name any of the companies, said in a statement it had asked anyone with relevant information to come forward. The port of Rotterdam is Europe's largest bunkering port, as well as one of the top three bunkering ports worldwide. Listed Dutch tank storage company Vopak is among the companies active in the sector, but said in an email it didn't expect to be impacted by the investigation, since it's not involved in  the pricing and trading of bunker fuels . Industry group Nove, which represents independent fuel traders in Rotterdam and Amsterdam with a combined market share of 40 percent, said two of its members had been visited by the ACM and that other companies had received a questionnaire. Nove, which also declined to name the companies involved, said it was surprised by the investigation.  Prices for maritime fuels in Rotterdam are amongst the lowest in the world and are very transparent , the organization's head, Erik de Vries, said. Fines for participants in a cartel can amount to 40 percent of a company's worldwide annual revenue, or to 900,000 euros for people in charge of the deals. Fines can be lowered for companies that admit wrongdoing, the ACM said.     The possible shipping fuel cartel is not the first on the radar of the ACM in the port of Rotterdam, Europe's largest. In recent years, it opened inquiries into possible price-fixing schemes involving tugboat companies and a large container terminal. These investigations are still ongoing, a spokesman for the ACM said on Wednesday.

The country's national Olympic committee (NOC) remains banned almost two years after the government was accused of interference with a new sports law As a result, Kuwaiti athletes had to compete under the Olympic flag at the Rio de Janeiro Games last year. They also have no access to IOC funds.  We have had no sign (from the government) until a week ago,  Pere Miro, the IOC's deputy director general for relations with the Olympic Movement told Reuters on Wednesday.  They have now written a letter to us saying that they have a new sports law and ... that they would like us to discuss with them this law and see if we can solve the situation.  This is a U-turn for Kuwait which in 2016 had repeatedly sued the IOC unsuccessfully for 1 billion dollars as compensation for the ban. Kuwait said last year the ban was unjustifiable and unfair and said the IOC had not conducted  an appropriate investigation . Kuwait was suspended in 2010 over a similar dispute but reinstated before the 2012 London Olympics.  Kuwait has also seen more than 15 national sports bodies suspended, Miro said, including the country's football federation.  Kuwait at this moment is not able to take part in the majority of international competitions. Football is obviously the most popular but more than 15 federations have been banned,  he said.   We believe this letter is a sign of goodwill already. This letter opens the possibility of dialogue that they closed months ago.    Miro said the IOC would now study the new law to see if it was in line with its Olympic charter before meeting with the Kuwaitis. Athletics powerhouse Kenya, while not suspended yet, has also not received any IOC funding since March following internal squabbles, mismanagement of funds for Rio de Janeiro and disputes with the government. The IOC has long demanded a new election for Kenya's Olympic committee but Miro said Kenya was dragging its feet. A local court has blocked a new election pending a decision regarding the participation in the vote of one local federation in the latest delay after a deal between the government, the NOC and the IOC was carved out after Rio.  Kenya is one of the most important athletics countries in the world,  Miro said.  We are not happy at all. It's a shame that a country that is so powerful, so good, that has so high potential is in this situation.  He said the IOC would continue with the funding freeze until an election was held and new NOC leadership elected.   They (current NOC) do nothing in this moment. They perpetuate themselves. We hope this court will act fast and as diligently as possible. The decision was expected a few days ago but has again been postponed until the end of July,  he said.

The Edinburgh-based bank on said on Wednesday it agreed to settle the lawsuit with the U.S. Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) that accused it of mis-selling $32 billion of mortgage-backed securities before the global financial crisis. Analysts had previously estimated RBS would have to pay between $3.5 to $5 billion to settle the case.  It is never a great experience for a CEO to be writing such a large cheque...but unfortunately that is the price we are paying to get this organization into a much better shape,  RBS Chief Executive Ross McEwan told reporters. McEwan has been trying to clean up RBS's balance sheet and end an array of legal cases so the government can sell the more than 70 percent stake in the bank it obtained via a 46 billion pound ($59.6 billion) bailout during the financial crisis. RBS said it will get a reimbursement of about 581 million pounds from other parties and the fine is largely covered by existing provisions. The bank, whose shares were broadly flat at 1400 GMT, said it will record a charge of 151 million pounds in next month's result related to the fine. RBS has moved closer to resolving some of the major barriers to its recovery in recent months. This included paying 1 billion pounds to settle with shareholders who claim they were misled before its near collapse in 2008, while the government has backed a new plan to resolve its EU state-aid requirements. No Doj Update McEwan said there was no update on talks to settle what is expected to be the biggest fine in the bank's history with the U.S. Department of Justice over claims it mis-sold mortgage bonds. Edward Kirth, an analyst at KBW, said in a note to clients RBS will probably have to pay a further $10 billion to settle with the DOJ and other legal cases. RBS still has about $3.7 billion put aside to resolve lawsuits over mortgage-backed securities, packaged and sold before the U.S. housing meltdown and financial crisis in 2008. The case against RBS is the biggest and last of 18 lawsuits the FHFA filed in 2011 over about $200 billion in mortgage-backed securities that various banks sold to U.S. mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The FHFA previously recovered $17.87 billion to resolve most of those lawsuits, including $5.83 billion from Bank of America Corp and $4 billion from JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Five sovereigns are on Negative Outlook, showing that the balance of risks is towards more negative actions, although macroeconomic imbalances are starting to correct, providing some support to current ratings. In 1H17, Fitch downgraded Costa Rica by one notch and Suriname by two notches, while El Salvador entered into a default on local debt which was subsequently cured. Suriname's rating Outlook remains Negative, as do those of Brazil, Chile, Ecuador and Mexico. The global ratio of Negative to Positive sovereign Outlooks has more than halved this year, as described in Fitch's 2017 Mid-Year Sovereign Review and Outlook, but no Latin American sovereigns are on Positive Outlook. Our only positive action on a Latin American sovereign in 1H17 was the revision of Colombia's Outlook to Stable from Negative, following tax reform and sharp falls in the current account deficit and inflation. Sovereign credit pressures in the region generally stem from the challenging macroeconomic backdrop, the difficulty of fiscal consolidation, and sometimes volatile or polarised politics. All of these factors will see important developments in the second half of 2017 and 2018 as countries present their 2018 budgets and several elections take place. NAFTA renegotiation is also expected to start. Fitch projects regional GDP growth to recover moderately to 1.1% in 2017 and 2.5% in 2018 following two years of contraction. Risks to these forecasts include greater US protectionism and immigration controls, slower-than-expected Chinese growth, weaker commodity prices and tighter external financing conditions. Inflation is falling in most countries, giving greater flexibility to central banks to reduce or stabilise interest rates at lower levels. Most current account deficits have also fallen on the back of slower growth and exchange rate correction, and with the exception of Bolivia and Venezuela, we forecast broadly stable international reserves. Some countries are taking steps to improve public debt dynamics. Chile and Mexico are seeing benefits from earlier tax reforms, and Colombia and Uruguay have enacted tax increases in the past year. But further measures may be needed to ensure deficit reduction in the face of weak growth and reduced revenues. Fiscal buffers are small or non-existent outside Chile and Peru (although the latter is expected to use some of its buffers to meet flood reconstruction costs), and consolidation remains especially challenging in Argentina, Brazil, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador and Suriname. Nine important elections are scheduled in Latin America over the next 18 months. The run-up to and outcome of next year's elections in Brazil and Mexico could have implications for policy orientation. Argentina's congressional mid-term elections in October will indicate the level of popular backing for President Macri's policies. Political deadlock was a major factor in our negative rating actions on Costa Rica and El Salvador, which have elections scheduled in 1Q18.

The country's national Olympic committee (NOC) remains banned almost two years after the government was accused of interference with a new sports law As a result, Kuwaiti athletes had to compete under the Olympic flag at the Rio de Janeiro Games last year. They also have no access to IOC funds.  We have had no sign (from the government) until a week ago,  Pere Miro, the IOC's deputy director general for relations with the Olympic Movement told Reuters on Wednesday.  They have now written a letter to us saying that they have a new sports law and ... that they would like us to discuss with them this law and see if we can solve the situation.  This is a U-turn for Kuwait which in 2016 had repeatedly sued the IOC unsuccessfully for 1 billion dollars as compensation for the ban. Kuwait said last year the ban was unjustifiable and unfair and said the IOC had not conducted  an appropriate investigation . Kuwait was suspended in 2010 over a similar dispute but reinstated before the 2012 London Olympics.  Kuwait has also seen more than 15 national sports bodies suspended, Miro said, including the country's football federation.  Kuwait at this moment is not able to take part in the majority of international competitions. Football is obviously the most popular but more than 15 federations have been banned,  he said.   We believe this letter is a sign of goodwill already. This letter opens the possibility of dialogue that they closed months ago.    Miro said the IOC would now study the new law to see if it was in line with its Olympic charter before meeting with the Kuwaitis. Athletics powerhouse Kenya, while not suspended yet, has also not received any IOC funding since March following internal squabbles, mismanagement of funds for Rio de Janeiro and disputes with the government. The IOC has long demanded a new election for Kenya's Olympic committee but Miro said Kenya was dragging its feet. A local court has blocked a new election pending a decision regarding the participation in the vote of one local federation in the latest delay after a deal between the government, the NOC and the IOC was carved out after Rio.  Kenya is one of the most important athletics countries in the world,  Miro said.  We are not happy at all. It's a shame that a country that is so powerful, so good, that has so high potential is in this situation.  He said the IOC would continue with the funding freeze until an election was held and new NOC leadership elected.   They (current NOC) do nothing in this moment. They perpetuate themselves. We hope this court will act fast and as diligently as possible. The decision was expected a few days ago but has again been postponed until the end of July,  he said.

The vividly illustrated e-books in the local Khmer language tell the stories of eight different female characters who overcome challenges through courage and ingenuity under the tagline  Girls Can Do Anything . One story features a girl who invents a flying contraption that looks like a bike with bat-like wings to save her village while another girl fights aliens seeking to destroy her city.  The availability of original storybooks for children in Khmer is limited. Content related to the empowerment of women is even more scarce,  said Edward Anderson from The Asia Foundation, which is running the project.  The books ... can serve as role models for young girls, helping them to break away from traditional subservient expectations and empower them to become leaders,  added Anderson, the acting Cambodia chief for the U.S.-based charity. Cambodia was ranked 112 out of 144 countries in the World Economic Forum's Global Gender Gap 2016, after scoring poorly in political empowerment and education attainment for women. Campaigners say a gap in education persists in the impoverished Southeast Asian nation, with fewer girls attending and completing school, while sexual and labor exploitation remain a serious problem for women. The book series, under a wider initiative known as  Let's Read!  which aims to encourage reading among children, was created by Cambodian writers and illustrators during a  hackathon  event. Prum Kunthearo, one of the eight writers, said it was the first time she had used a female protagonist in a story since she began writing books in 2013.  She said her story  Green Star , about a girl who uses her knowledge of science to help a boy find his way home, was inspired by a lack of women in the science and technology sectors in the nation of 16 million people.  Children should understand the importance of gender equality from an early age,  she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone from Phnom Penh. Illustrator Pors Socheata hoped Cambodian girls would be empowered through the stories.  Most of the characters in our storybooks are males, especially when they are superheroes or have achieved something good,  she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Although the books are only available in digital format for now, The Asia Foundation said it is working with the Cambodian government and companies to promote them, while it explores the possibility of publishing the books in hard copies to distribute to remote parts of the country.

The watchdog, known by its Dutch acronym ACM, said it had visited some of the dozens of companies active in fuel production, transportation, storage and trading in Rotterdam, Antwerp and Amsterdam after receiving information from the police. The ACM, which did not name any of the companies, said in a statement it had asked anyone with relevant information to come forward. The port of Rotterdam is Europe's largest bunkering port, as well as one of the top three bunkering ports worldwide. Listed Dutch tank storage company Vopak is among the companies active in the sector, but said in an email it didn't expect to be impacted by the investigation, since it's not involved in  the pricing and trading of bunker fuels . Industry group Nove, which represents independent fuel traders in Rotterdam and Amsterdam with a combined market share of 40 percent, said two of its members had been visited by the ACM and that other companies had received a questionnaire. Nove, which also declined to name the companies involved, said it was surprised by the investigation.  Prices for maritime fuels in Rotterdam are amongst the lowest in the world and are very transparent , the organization's head, Erik de Vries, said. Fines for participants in a cartel can amount to 40 percent of a company's worldwide annual revenue, or to 900,000 euros for people in charge of the deals. Fines can be lowered for companies that admit wrongdoing, the ACM said.     The possible shipping fuel cartel is not the first on the radar of the ACM in the port of Rotterdam, Europe's largest. In recent years, it opened inquiries into possible price-fixing schemes involving tugboat companies and a large container terminal. These investigations are still ongoing, a spokesman for the ACM said on Wednesday.

Concerned by current tensions that are affecting these countries with whom we have close and friendly ties, we call for a rapid de-escalation that would be in everyone's interest,  the French foreign ministry's statement said. France, which has close ties with Egypt and the United Arab Emirates while also being a major arms supplier to Qatar and a key ally of Saudi Arabia, has to date been relatively discreet on the crisis, largely sticking to calls for calm.

The prevalence of the malaria parasite in children under five has plunged to 0.2 percent from 4 percent in 2011, according to the National Malaria Control Programme (NMCP). The total number of new malaria cases across the West African nation has fallen by about 40 percent in that time - to 155,450 last year down from 262,000 in 2011, NMCP data shows.  Gambia is aiming to achieve the milestone of having no new malaria cases by 2020, but donor fatigue is a concern with a funding gap of over $25 million, said NMCP head Balla Kandeh.   This last mile is the most difficult - we need more support to sustain the gains we have made yet donors often turn their attention elsewhere as cases drop,  he said, adding that malaria rates in Gambia may rebound if more funding is not secured soon. Kandeh hopes that Gambia's new leadership under President Adama Barrow, who won a December election to bring an end to 22 years of autocratic rule under Yahya Jammeh, will attract back donors after many left during the previous regime.  There is a better working environment under Barrow, with less constraints and less political uncertainty,  he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  The fear of the unknown has gone.   Aside from the usual control measures, such as antimalarial drugs, insecticide-treated bed nets and indoor spraying, Gambia has successfully used technology to tackle malaria, according to Carla Fajardo of aid agency Catholic Relief Services (CRS). Tablets, online platforms and GPS have been used to track delivery of the above strategies, with real-time data enabling decisions to be made on the fly, while internet service providers have boosted bandwidth in remote areas, Fajardo said. The world has made huge strides against malaria since 2000, with death rates plunging by 60 percent and at least six million lives saved globally, the World Health Organization (WHO) says. But efforts to end one of the world's deadliest diseases - which kills about 430,000 people a year, mostly children in sub-Saharan Africa - are under threat as mosquitoes become increasingly resistant to measures such as bed nets and drugs.

Led by Europe- and San Francisco-based venture capital fund Index Ventures, the fund-raising round was one of the biggest ever Series B rounds in Europe. It should provide some comfort to the British capitol as it jostles to hold onto its reputation as Europe's leading hub for the nascent fintech sector.  The investment dwarfs the 19.5 million pounds ($25 million) raised by London-based rival Monzo in its Series B round earlier this year.   Revolut, which has around 700,000 customers, over 400,000 of them based in Britain, provides payment cards that can be used abroad to pay for goods and services at the exchange rate used by banks anywhere that Mastercard (MA.N) is accepted.  Other start-ups, such as Monzo and Germany's N26, offer similar products, but Revolut says it is distinctive in offering interbank exchange rates, zero-fee international money transfers, and in allowing customers to hold and exchange up to 16 different currencies in their app-based accounts. Revolut was set up in July 2015 by Russian-born Nikolay Storonsky, who first moved to London in 2007 to work for Lehman Bros as a derivatives trader and later also worked for Credit Suisse.   If he were starting the company now, as Britain heads out of the European Union, Storonsky would still choose London as its base, he said.   I don’t see any problems with Brexit,  he told Reuters.  London is much more international than anywhere else in Europe, (and) in terms of regulation, it’s a great place to be.  Some fintech firms are worried about losing  passporting  rights, which give companies licenced in one EU country the right to trade freely in any other. But Storonsky, whose firm has a UK e-money license, said if that happens it would only take a few months to get such a license for the rest of the EU.   Storonsky, 34, said he wanted to set up a business that acted like a bank but had less bureaucracy.   I just don't like banks,  he said.  They're so bureaucratic, with so many managers not really doing anything ... If you fired 80 percent of bankers, nothing would change.   Bitcoin Bet  Revolut also announced that it is adding digital currency bitcoin BTC=BTSP to its app in response to high demand from customers. Users will now be able to hold, exchange, spend and transfer bitcoin the same way they use other currencies. Rival cryptocurrencies Ether and Litecoin will soon be added. Revolut, whose license does not allow it to invest clients' money, gets revenue from commissions paid by merchants, from users who change more than 5000 euros ($5,736) per month and from add-ons such as insurance, which is provided by third parties through the app. It is not yet profitable, but that does not worry its founder.       It’s normal at this point for a start-up – this is how billion-dollar companies are being made now,  Storonsky said.  The firm had intended on breaking even by November, but it now says that will take longer, because it is using the extra funding to expand the company into the United States and Asia.  Revolut also secured more money from London-based Balderton Capital and Californian Ribbit Capital. The latest cash injection takes its total investment so far to $83 million. It will run a further $5 million crowdfunding campaign this month.

But as the U.S. administration decides on a military strategy, the last 16 years have shown that Washington cannot rely solely on its troops to secure the Afghan state or stop groups like the Taliban from using the country as a base for attacks against the West. The U.S. must pursue political solutions as well.   For Washington, that task includes looking beyond buttressing the Kabul regime to engaging with major regional powers, namely Pakistan, China, and India. A fresh approach to Islamabad is particularly important. Trump must increase the pressure Washington is putting on Pakistan to contain the expansion of the sanctuary it provides for extremists like the Haqqanis - today one of the most influential Islamist militant organizations in South Asia.   Haqqani, a Taliban-allied militant group established in the 1970s during the Afghan war against the Soviets, maintains close ties with al Qaeda. The network rose to power in large part through the backing of Pakistan, a nuclear state, which supports Islamist militants in Afghanistan in order to create a power vacuum that Pakistan itself could fill by proxy.  Haqqani’s increasing military and political operations in cities across southeastern, northern, and western Afghanistan, especially in the capital Kabul, have enabled its Taliban affiliates to control or contest territory that is home to about a third of the Afghan population, nearly 10 million people. According to national security expert Peter Bergen, this figure is greater than the population controlled by Islamic State in Syria and Iraq at the group’s peak in 2014. For al Qaeda and its affiliates in Afghanistan, it represents a base from which militants can recruit, train, and plot attacks against the West, including, principally, the United States.  More from Reuters Commentary  Dan DePetris: Steve Bannon is right on Afghanistan Mohamad Bazzi: Islamic State adapts to a 'leaderless jihad' Pakistan’s interference in Afghanistan is hardly new. For decades it has tried to ensure that whatever regime rises to power in Kabul aligns with Islamabad's interests. Since the U.S.-led engagement in Afghanistan after the 9/11 attacks, Pakistan has quietly reestablished militant proxies to both hasten the departure of Western forces and influence post-NATO Afghanistan. The Trump administration’s announcement that it is considering expanding U.S. military involvement in the region, however, changes Pakistan's calculus.    The current Afghan unity government was formed in Kabul in 2014 after a disputed election required Washington to mediate a power-sharing agreement between political rivals. Today, President Ashraf Ghani continues to face unresolved ethnic tensions, causing deep unease in the country’s diverse communities, who see themselves being increasingly marginalized. This political crisis threatens the fledgling Afghan army and police forces, where many believe the Ghani administration has put ethnic interests ahead of national ones. In such cases, disaffected Afghan security leaders are increasingly co-opted by the Taliban. If this infiltration is not stanched, the U.S. and Afghan security forces may face increased risk of insider attacks: Afghan soldiers who defect to the Taliban and turn on U.S. and Afghan troops.   From a strategic perspective, the co-option of the Afghan military and national police by Haqqani and the Taliban weakens the ability of Afghan forces to take over security from NATO and undermines Afghan opposition to al Qaeda and its allies. Such co-option becomes even more problematic when considering the remarkably high death rate of Afghan soldiers, which already hinders their ability to combat well-financed militant forces. In a report released in February, the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction found that nearly 7,000 Afghan soldiers and police had been killed in the first 10 months of 2016. Before NATO troops depart the region, the U.S.-led coalition must ensure that Afghanistan has a sufficiently trained and cohesive force to defeat the Islamist militants and their backers.  Although it has suffered a recent spate of deadly attacks, the Afghan capital has largely avoided the years of bloody upheaval that has affected the rest of the country. But the security of the Afghan state is far from assured - especially if Pakistan’s military and intelligence leaders continue to support proxies like Haqqani.  Another complicating factor in the current political crisis is the wider proxy war. Over the past few years, Russia and Iran have expanded their presence in Afghanistan in order to counter the Islamic State, while simultaneously increasing challenges to U.S. power and the Western-backed government in Afghanistan.   One potential worst-case scenario is the collapse of the central Afghan government. If that happens, U.S. and NATO troops could find themselves fighting a Taliban-dominated territory stretching across Afghanistan to the border of Iran.  To create a more effective U.S. policy, Washington must deal with the Ghani administration’s political crisis. Unwilling to unite ethnic factions, the Afghan state remains paralyzed to the point that most observers believe it would collapse without indefinite U.S. backing. The Trump administration must therefore appoint an envoy to enforce the existing legitimate power-sharing arrangements between the Kabul regime and diverse ethnicities, which would help secure and stabilize the country and the region at large.  At the same time, the U.S. must work with the next-generation leaders of the Afghan army and national police to address infiltration of the Afghan security forces by Taliban-Haqqani factions. The anticipated additional U.S. troops will strengthen NATO’s combat support role to train and mentor the Afghan forces and help them aggressively counter the militants’ hold on territory in Afghanistan. But countering their infiltration will entail a restructuring of regional strategy, as the U.S. will have to work closely with the Ghani administration to execute political and security reform while confronting Pakistan’s support for Islamist extremists.  To that end, Washington should expose Pakistan's duplicity publicly where it supports U.S.-designated terror organizations like Haqqani, and begin sanctioning Pakistani military and intelligence leaders who support proxies. Although such measures would be drastic against an ostensible ally (and would require judicious application to protect sources and methods), previous approaches to address Pakistan's sanctuary for militants have failed.  Equally important, the White House must adopt a different approach to the larger proxy war and hold major powers accountable for their support of violent extremists that threaten regional stability. Washington should strengthen its alignment with India, and co-operate with China on regional concerns of mutual interest, in particular growing terrorism and economic security. Bolstered relationships with the major world powers, in particular with Saudi Arabia, which has good relations with Pakistan, could help contain its expanding sanctuary for extremists and more effectively forge a diplomatic solution between Kabul, Islamabad, and its Taliban-Haqqani proxies. That political solution, in turn, could de-escalate the Afghan conflict and help stabilize the South Asia region.

At the same time, Fitch has assigned a final senior unsecured rating of 'BBB' to Annington Funding Plc and to its GBP4 billion EMTN Programme. Fitch has assigned final ratings to the following bonds issued through the programme: - GBP625,000,000 2.646% Sterling Fixed Rate Bonds due 12 July 2025 - GBP600,000,000 3.184% Sterling Fixed Rate Bonds due 12 July 2029 - GBP625,000,000 3.685% Sterling Fixed Rate Bonds due 12 July 2034 - GBP625,000,000 3.935% Sterling Fixed Rate Bonds due 12 July 2047 - EUR600,000,000 1.650% Euro Fixed Rate Bonds due 12 July 2024 The final ratings reflect the repayment of issuer loans under Annington's existing CMBS transaction, which also result in the AF4 and AF5 tranches being paid in full or fully defeased, and all security relating to the Annington Limited corporate group being released. Annington's approximately GBP3 billion bond issuance is larger than Fitch's assumption of GBP1.75 billion, and removes the need for bank loan bridge financing, removing three-year liquidity risk. KEY RATING DRIVERS Portfolio Leased to MoD: The ratings of Annington are supported by a portfolio of 38,979 residential properties (the retained estate leased to Ministry of Defence (MoD), a department of the United Kingdom (AA/Negative). This generates stable, long-term, contracted rent. The MoD is obliged to pay rent on all leased units, regardless of occupancy, and is responsible for maintenance and repair. The MoD can release units back to Annington, but must ensure the properties are in good condition or pay dilapidation costs. Annington typically sells released units on the open market, generating substantial reversionary returns. Annington was created in November 1996 when it acquired a 999-year head lease over 57,434 homes across 765 sites from the MoD for GBP1.66 billion. Annington then provided 200-year underleases over the sites to the MoD to house married service personnel and their families. Stable, Long-Term Contracted Revenue: The retained estate generates high-quality revenue that anchors the business profile of Annington. MoD rent is set at a 58% discount to open market rent until the 2021-2024 site review. Rent levels are reviewed on a five-year rolling basis, based on designated units on each site. Rent is then adjusted to reflect market movements. This exposes Annington to an element of price risk, but rent on nearly all sites has increased over the past 19 years and total rent has never decreased. Under the terms of the leases, the MoD must pay rent, regardless of occupancy, and is responsible for maintenance and repair, generating high gross to net rental margins. Large Residential Properties Portfolio: As of 31 December 2016, the retained estate was independently valued at GBP7.2 billion based on discounted cash flow under the contract, or GBP8.4 billion using vacant possession values. Units within the retained estate range from flats to large detached houses, although most are two- to three-bedroom semi-detached or terraced houses, largely in south-east and south-west England where housing demand has been strong. Annual rent under the five-year reviews has grown by a CAGR of 3.8% from 1996-2016, despite the retained estate having fewer units owing to sales, higher than the UK CPI of 1.9%. Site Review: Apart from the rent review cycle, each site assessed over a four-year period starting in 2021. The 42% currently payable will be reviewed site by site with a view to moving more towards open market rental levels. As a number of elements that make up the current discount will be reduced or eliminated, the discount is expected to fall to 25%-35%, substantially boosting rental income. Annington and the MoD have maintained positive working relations for 20 years, but any disputes during the site review will be resolved through an official arbitration process. Reversionary Gains: The MoD can release surplus property back to Annington with a six-month notice period, after which the company may use the property as it sees fit. To date, Annington has disposed of 18,539 units for more than GBP1.8 billion, achieving 98% of the open market value. The portfolio's current vacant possession value exceeds the discounted cash flow value, which factors in the MoD leases, by almost 15%, indicating strong reversionary potential. Annington also rents released properties, often back to the MoD. The company intends to increase its rental portfolio, which currently comprises around 1,388 owned and 78 managed homes. The MoD is likely to increase releases in the medium to long term to offset potentially higher rents and to reduce vacant properties, which are currently around 20%. UK Market Fundamentals Support Growth: There is a persistent shortage of UK housing and build rates are not closing the gap. This lack of supply continues to push house price inflation well ahead of earnings growth. Affordable rental housing, Annington's primary market, is particularly under pressure, owing to insufficient social housing. Accordingly, the company's ability to generate good returns is unlikely to diminish, despite the portfolio being largely secondary or even tertiary. Brexit: The overall effect of Brexit on Annington is likely to be muted, as Fitch expects the MoD's current housing needs to be maintained, and the number of public-sector and former military personnel is unlikely to decline. MoD housing demand is underpinned by the Joint Force 2025 commitments by the UK government. High Cash-Flow Leverage: Annington has a relatively weak financial profile for the 'BBB' category. This reflects the discounted rental stream, which affects cash flow leverage. We expect Annington's cash-flow leverage to remain high post refinancing, with a forecast LTV of around 47%, an EBITDA NIC of 1.7x and high net debt/EBITDA of 19x at the end of the financial year to March 2018 (FYE18). Further releases by the MoD may contribute to deleveraging, but the effect is likely to be marginal. This financial weakness is mitigated by the quality of the MoD lease. In addition, the site review may significantly improve Annington's position, although the outcome remains uncertain. DERIVATION SUMMARY Annington has a number of unique characteristics that distinguish it from most publicly rated real-estate peers. These include the leases to the MoD, under which there is no void risk and maintenance and repair, as well as dilapidations are passed to the MoD, which is reflected in the rental discount. In addition, military housing needs, rather than residential market needs, drive demand. Fitch views Annington's business profile as stronger than most peers'. Annington, for example, has a similar financial profile to Grainger Plc (BB/Stable), but a significantly stronger business profile. Other European residential peers operate largely in regulated markets, such as Sweden and Germany, where income is below market and there is good reversionary potential. These companies can achieve reversionary gains when tenants vacate properties or when apartments are upgraded, whereas Annington depends on the MoD to releases properties. Like Annington, residential real-estate companies tend to support relatively high net debt/EBITDA and LTVs, given the high number of properties, low voids and stable income. No parent or subsidiary linkage was used in this rating and there is no Country Ceiling in effect. We have not uplifted the issue rating given most properties are leased to the MoD in the retained estate and not easily used in a recovery. KEY ASSUMPTIONS - Low single-digit rental growth - Small scale releases by the MoD - Stable housing prices - Long-term funding issued under its medium-term note programme. RATING SENSITIVITIES Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action - The results of the site review substantially increasing rental income - Net debt/EBITDA falling below 15x Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action - Substantial weakening of the housing market - Very high levels of releases from the MoD, particularly if concentrated in a single geographic area - Significant fall in house prices leading or releveraging leading to LTV rising above 50% LIQUIDITY Healthy Liquidity: Following the refinancing, Annington's liquidity is strong, given there is no short-term debt and the company has cash available on the balance sheet and access to the committed, undrawnGBP300 million revolver. Annington's long-dated bond issuance has significantly extended the debt maturity profile to an average of 14 years, (including bank debt) with the first bond repayment due in July 2024.

Data from brokerage Colliers International show a 17 percent surge so far this year in landlord allowances for tenants to furnish and build out an office, indicating a more competitive market as employment booms in Manhattan. Rising concessions typically herald a downturn. Yet the allowance increase, on top of an 8 percent jump through June in the number of free months rent landlords offer, point to the city's robust real estate market for office space. (For graphic, click: tmsnrt.rs/2tEG6Re)  When you think landlords are competing for tenants, it sounds like they're desperate, that there are so few tenants,  Craig Caggiano, an executive director in Collier's New York office, said in an interview.   To me it talks to the overall strength of the market.  A construction boom and the use of open floor plans, where the space workers occupy has shrunk, have effectively increased the office supply in Manhattan where demand remains strong. Leasing activity through June ran 22 percent above Manhattan's 10-year average, Colliers said. The traditional financial services and insurance industries outpaced technology, advertising, media and information, a sector that has led job growth and leasing since the downturn. Record low unemployment in Manhattan and population growth throughout New York City, which has reversed a decades-old decline, are driving the real estate market. The demand for nicer pantries and other workplace amenities, such as lounge areas, have led landlords to increase the allowance they provide in leases for  tenant improvements.  TI, in industry parlance, jumped to $80.55 a square foot in the first half, up from $68.91 last year and $34.87 in 2008, Colliers said. Free rent climbed to 10.7 months in the first half, up from 9.9 months in 2016 and 6.0 months in 2008. Rising expectations for exceptional workplaces have pushed up construction costs, while demand for more flexible leases and workplaces have pressured landlords, explained Jamie Hodari, co-founder and chief executive of Industrious, a chain of 26 U.S. coworking sites.  The dominant trend right now in commercial real estate is this increasing push for flexibility among tenants,  he said.  You just can't compete for talent anymore if people walk into your office and it looks unpleasant and unhappy and outdated.

Azerbaijan, an energy-rich ex-Soviet republic, has seen its economy shrinking and its currency weakening as oil prices have fallen. The country's biggest lender, state-run International Bank of Azerbaijan, has recently launched a restructuring of more than $3 billion of its debt. Another state company, Azerbaijan Railways, or ADY, has said it wants to explore options for the possible refinancing of some of its liabilities.  Despite a fall in oil prices, we managed to boost our currency reserves by $3 billion to $40.6 billion, which is a result of a correct economic policy,  Aliyev was quoted by the state news agency Azertag. He said that the non-oil sector grew by 1.7 percent year-on-year in the six months of 2017, while non-oil industry grew by 4.4 percent and the amount of investment totalled $5 billion.  The biggest part of investment came from foreign investors and we are confident that foreign investors' interest will be growing,  Aliyev said. The president said exports rose by 36 percent and import reduced by 15 percent in the first half of this year, resulting in trade surplus of $1.9 billion.

Concerned by current tensions that are affecting these countries with whom we have close and friendly ties, we call for a rapid de-escalation that would be in everyone's interest,  the French foreign ministry's statement said. France, which has close ties with Egypt and the United Arab Emirates while also being a major arms supplier to Qatar and a key ally of Saudi Arabia, has to date been relatively discreet on the crisis, largely sticking to calls for calm.

U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is visiting the region this week. Le Drian is set to insist on the importance for France to strengthen the fight against terrorism and against its financing, as well as urge Gulf countries to act together to tackle this.

Attempting to explain why inflation has remained well below its 2 percent target, the bank said temporary factors like electricity rebates and competition among food vendors as well as global structural changes relating to technology were part of the puzzle.  Over the projection horizon, these structural factors could exert disinflationary pressure in Canada and abroad that is not fully captured in the base-case projection,  the bank said in its quarterly Monetary Policy Report. The bank, whose official mandate is to control inflation, raised interest rates on Wednesday for the first time in nearly seven years, even though inflation shows no sign of becoming a problem for the Canadian economy. In explaining the contradiction of raising rates in the absence of inflation, the bank said it believed inflation would reach close to 2 percent in the middle of 2018 as temporary factors disappear. It also warned that advanced economies may not be properly measuring global potential growth, which means there could be more excess capacity in the economy than policymakers realize.  If lower inflation reflects increased global potential and heightened competition, it suggests higher living standards rather than signaling economic weakness,  the bank said. It said a rebound in food prices and the end of electricity rebates in the province of Ontario will together add about 0.6 percentage point to inflation by the middle of 2018. The closing of the output gap, now expected around the end of 2017, will also eventually boost inflation. The effect of excess supply would subtract 0.2 percentage point from inflation in the third quarter of 2017, it said.  As excess supply is absorbed inflation is expected to return sustainably close to the 2 percent target,  it said. But because the slowdown in inflation is being seen across advanced economies, common factors may be playing a role.  One possible explanation is that inflation expectations may have drifted downward resulting from a long period of below-target inflation in many advanced economies,  the bank said. It said structural advances may have boosted productivity in ways that are not readily measured, adding to global potential growth and  thus implying that there is more excess capacity than is captured by standard estimates.

The data also showed the unemployment rate in the period between March and May fell to its lowest since 1975 at 4.5 percent, below the average forecast of 4.6 for Wednesday's figure in a Reuters poll of economists. But the figures on wage growth showed the challenge facing Prime Minister Theresa May and her new government, with growing signs that households are feeling the strain of rising prices since last year's Brexit vote.  Despite the strong jobs picture ... there has been another real-terms fall in total earnings, with the growth in weekly wages low and inflation still rising,  said Matt Hughes, senior statistician at the Office for National Statistics. Inflation hit an almost four-year high of 2.9 percent in May, official data showed last month, a bigger increase than economists had expected. The ONS said pay including bonuses, adjusted for inflation, fell 0.7 percent in the three months to May - the sharpest drop since mid-2014. In nominal terms, total earnings rose by an annual 1.8 percent, the weakest increase since the three months to November 2014 and compared with 2.1 percent in the period to April. This was in line with the Reuters poll consensus. FILE PHOTO: Workers clean windows over looking Docklands Light Railway in Canary Wharf, London, Britain July 5, 2017.Dylan Martinez/File PhotoExcluding bonuses, earnings in nominal terms rose by 2.0 percent year-on-year against expectations for a 1.9 percent rise. The Bank of England is watching wage growth closely as it gauges whether the increase in inflation is creating longer-lasting pressure on prices. It expects wages to rise by 2 percent this year before picking up in 2018 and 2019. Bank of England Deputy Governor Ben Broadbent said he was not yet ready to vote for higher interest rates, substantially lessening the chances there will be a rise in borrowing costs next month, according to an interview published on Wednesday. Slideshow (2 Images)The number of people in work rose by 175,000 in the three months to May, taking the employment rate to a record high of 74.9 percent, the ONS said. So far the central bank believes there is little pressure on most employers to raise pay sharply which could feed a more permanent inflation problem. The ONS said the number of unemployment benefit claimants rose by 5,900 to 814,500 in June. Economists taking part in the Reuters poll had expected the number of benefit claimants - which is considered to be a potential early warning sign of an economic downturn - to rise by 10,000.

(Adds details, comment, byline, update prices) By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss NEW YORK, July 12 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury yields tumbled across the board on Wednesday after prepared remarks from Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen dampened growing expectations of more than one interest rate hike for the rest of the year. Yields, which move inversely to prices, dropped to three-week lows for the two-year note, while those on three-to-10-year maturities slid to two-week troughs. In testimony to be delivered to Congress later on Wednesday morning, Yellen said the Fed would not need to raise rates  all that much further  to reach current low estimates of the neutral fed funds rate. She did say, though, that the U.S. economy was healthy enough to absorb further gradual rate increases and the slow reduction of the Fed's massive bond portfolio. In early trading, the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield fell to 2.302 percent, its lowest in two weeks, from 2.362 percent late on Tuesday. It was last at 2.319 percent. At the front-end of the curve, the two-year yield dropped as low as 1.331 percent from 1.379 percent and last traded at 1.351 percent.  The market was focused on the fact that the Fed may not be able to raise rates a lot more in this cycle because we're close to the neutral rate,  said Subadra Rajappa, head of U.S. rates strategy at Societe Generale in New York. She added that the comments followed  two to three months of weak prints on inflation.  Rate futures indicated a 53 percent chance that the Fed would raise key overnight borrowing costs at its Dec. 12-13 policy meeting, down from 60 percent shortly before the release of Yellen's speech, according to CME Group's FedWatch program.  A lot is going to depend on how the market reacts to the Fed's announcement of the change in its reinvestment policy,  Rajappa said.  If there is no sort of tantrum after the announcement, then it makes sense to hike rates in December.

Data from brokerage Colliers International show a 17 percent surge so far this year in landlord allowances for tenants to furnish and build out an office, indicating a more competitive market as employment booms in Manhattan. Rising concessions typically herald a downturn. Yet the allowance increase, on top of an 8 percent jump through June in the number of free months rent landlords offer, point to the city's robust real estate market for office space. (For graphic, click: tmsnrt.rs/2tEG6Re)  When you think landlords are competing for tenants, it sounds like they're desperate, that there are so few tenants,  Craig Caggiano, an executive director in Collier's New York office, said in an interview.   To me it talks to the overall strength of the market.  A construction boom and the use of open floor plans, where the space workers occupy has shrunk, have effectively increased the office supply in Manhattan where demand remains strong. Leasing activity through June ran 22 percent above Manhattan's 10-year average, Colliers said. The traditional financial services and insurance industries outpaced technology, advertising, media and information, a sector that has led job growth and leasing since the downturn. Record low unemployment in Manhattan and population growth throughout New York City, which has reversed a decades-old decline, are driving the real estate market. The demand for nicer pantries and other workplace amenities, such as lounge areas, have led landlords to increase the allowance they provide in leases for  tenant improvements.  TI, in industry parlance, jumped to $80.55 a square foot in the first half, up from $68.91 last year and $34.87 in 2008, Colliers said. Free rent climbed to 10.7 months in the first half, up from 9.9 months in 2016 and 6.0 months in 2008. Rising expectations for exceptional workplaces have pushed up construction costs, while demand for more flexible leases and workplaces have pressured landlords, explained Jamie Hodari, co-founder and chief executive of Industrious, a chain of 26 U.S. coworking sites.  The dominant trend right now in commercial real estate is this increasing push for flexibility among tenants,  he said.  You just can't compete for talent anymore if people walk into your office and it looks unpleasant and unhappy and outdated.

By Andrew Osborn and Olga Sichkar MOSCOW (Reuters) - A Moscow court convicted one of Russia's most flamboyant tycoons, Sergei Polonsky, of fraud on Wednesday, and yet the property developer who symbolized the excess of the oil-fueled boom times walked away a free man. The presiding judge, who had just sentenced Polonsky to five years in prison in one breath, ordered his release in the next, saying too much time had elapsed since his crime for the sentence to have legal force. Polonsky, 44, staged antics during his career ranging from a hunger strike to eating part of his tie on live TV. However, they failed to endear him with Russians left behind by the boom during President Vladimir Putin's first two terms in office and who are now struggling following a sharp economic slowdown. Vedomosti, a business daily, quoted him as saying in 2008 that anyone who did not have a billion dollars could  fuck off . Polonsky - a former occupant of the Forbes rich list with a fortune of $1.2 billion - disputes the accuracy of the quote. Nevertheless, it went viral as the global financial crisis was about to hit Russia and many ordinary people remember it with bitterness to this day. The conviction, despite his unexpected release, appears to mark the end of an era in Russian business when displays of fabulous riches were common and tycoons were self-made through wheeling and dealing. That has been replaced by a more sober atmosphere where the Kremlin frowns on the flaunting of wealth and only Kremlin-connected tycoons make the biggest fortunes. Polonsky has spent the last five years fighting the fraud allegations and more than two years in pre-trial detention in Moscow. He says his fate is a cautionary tale about the risks of doing business in Russia today. Making money is closely tied up with fickle and often corrupt political connections and business partners routinely betray one another, stealing and cheating their way to huge wealth, he alleged in court.                   It's civil war,  he told the judge in his final address.  How can we do business if we are destroying one another? The situation is close to catastrophic with the Russian economy.   Polonsky's legal problems began in 2012 when state prosecutors accused his firm of stealing more than 5.7 billion roubles (now $94 million) of prepayments for flats in an unfinished Moscow complex it was building. Polonsky indicated in court that state prosecutors had later revised that sum downwards to under 3 billion roubles.   The fallen tycoon, who at 1.93 meters (6 feet 4 inches) towers over most people, denied wrongdoing. He said the funds were taken in good faith, that many of the apartments had been delivered, but that the global crisis had made it impossible to hand over others on time. He alleged that business partners, keen to steal his firm, had helped to organize charges against him. They had encouraged scores of buyers who did not get their homes on time to cooperate with investigators, even though he was working with them to try to find a solution, Polonsky said. Russian real estate tycoon Sergei Polonsky (C), who was found guilty of fraud and then released, addresses journalists outside a court building in Moscow, Russia July 12, 2017.Maxim ShemetovThe judge sided with state prosecutors, however, and only the statute of limitations saved Polonsky from more prison time.    Forbes List to Jail  Polonsky, originally from St Petersburg, found success as a  young man, thriving in the anarchic 1990s that followed the fall of the Soviet Union. He and a friend started small, buying up unfinished apartments, doing them up, and selling them for a higher price. They soon graduated to entire buildings and built one of the city's early business centers.  Polonsky opened an office in Moscow in 2000 but he and his friend later split the business. Polonsky took sole control of the Moscow firm, which he called Mirax Group, and his friend the St Petersburg operation. Slideshow (6 Images)Mirax flourished, embarking on projects in the United States, Britain, Turkey and Ukraine among others. Back at home, it started building the Federation Tower, billed as the Russian capital's first skyscraper and the tallest building in Europe. In 2008, when Polonsky was 35 years old, Forbes magazine  estimated his wealth at $1.2 billion. Mirax was hit hard by the crisis of that same year, when demand for the swish apartments and town houses it specialized in building slumped, leaving the firm overstretched and mired in debt. It struggled to raise fresh capital. In October that year, Polonsky pledged to eat his tie if prices for elite apartments did not rise by a quarter in a year and a half. They didn't and Polonsky stuck to his promise. Mirax staggered on even as creditors called in its debts,  securing a loan of almost $400 million from a state lender. Polonsky liquidated the brand and renamed the firm. The crisis affected a residential complex Polonsky had taken on at the request of the Moscow authorities after the company he was working with on the project terminated the contract, citing Mirax's funding problems. Polonsky, in protest, declared the hunger strike and took up round-the-clock residence in a tent on the construction site.  In June 2013, the Interior Ministry charged him with embezzlement, saying he had taken 5.78 billion roubles in downpayments from people wanting to buy flats at the site that they never received. The funds had been illegally diverted to other Mirax entities, investigators said.  Polonsky, who at the time was in Cambodia where he also had real estate interests, denied wrongdoing. He spent time in a Cambodian prison after being accused of briefly kidnapping six Cambodian sailors in a New Year's Eve celebration gone wrong. In May 2015, he was deported to Moscow. Sporting long hair and a beard outside the court on Wednesday, Polonsky told reporters he had  something to say  about the verdict but would be devoting his first seven days of freedom to his wife.  When asked what his wider plans were, he replied:  To turn the world upside down.      Editing by David Stamp","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/russia-court-polonsky-idUSL8N1K3430"},

Premier, which holds a 25 percent interest in the block alongside Talos Energy and Sierra Oil and Gas, said estimates for the Zama-1 well were in excess of 1 billion barrels, which could extend into a neighboring block. The news of the discovery, in the first shallow-water offshore exploration well drilled by the private sector in Mexico since the country's 2014 energy sector opening, sent Premier's shares rocketing as much as 38 percent on the London Stock Exchange and helped the peso strengthen 0.70 percent to 17.785 per dollar. In afternoon trading in London, Premier Oil shares were up 34 percent at 61.83 pounds. The find also hands the government of President Enrique Pena Nieto, which ended state-oil firm Pemex's decades-long monopoly, a key victory as Mexico prepares to embark on fraught trade, security and immigration talks with U.S. President Donald Trump's administration.          Premier Oil's Chief Executive Tony Durrant said the discovery  adds materially  to Premier's portfolio of assets.  (The) Zama-1 discovery announcement appears about as material as we could possibly imagine at this early stage,  Jefferies analysts wrote in a note. The project is jointly owned with Talos Energy, which acts as operator and has a 35 percent stake, and Sierra Oil and Gas which holds the remaining 40 percent.  The Zama discovery by Talos is the most important achievement so far of the Mexico's Energy Reform. According to our data, Zama is one of the 20 largest shallow-water fields discovered globally in the past 20 years,  said Pablo Medina, an analyst at industry consultancy Wood Mackenzie.     Talos Energy is currently setting a liner to protect the discovered reservoirs, before drilling deeper to a total vertical depth of about 4,200 meters, Premier said. Pena Nieto championed the energy reform as a way to reverse an oil output slump dating back to 2004 and to kick-start long-lagging economic growth.  Later on Wednesday, Mexico will tender the latest batch of productive areas in the sixth auction open to private and foreign producers since the energy reform. Separately, Italian oil firm Eni said on Wednesday it was raising its oil estimate at its Amoca field off Mexico that it won as a production-sharing contract in a 2015 tender, to 1 billion barrels of oil equivalent.

Yellen, in a prepared testimony to be delivered to Congress at 10 a.m. ET (1400 GMT), said the economy is healthy enough to absorb further gradual rate increases and the slow wind down of the Federal Reserve's massive bond portfolio. The testimony depicted an economy that, while growing slowly, continued to add jobs, benefited from steady household consumption and a recent jump in business investment. Investors and some Fed officials, concerned with the recent dip in inflation, have been wanting to see a surer progress toward the central bank's goal of 2 percent inflation. Yellen ascribed the inflation drop to  a few unusual reductions in certain categories of prices  and said it would eventually drop out of the calculation.  I'm not very surprised by Yellen's comments. She's been pretty steadfast that we're raising rates... The market is liking the fact that she's seeing economic growth,  said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago.  What the Fed's doing and she's doing is continuing the case for raising rates.

In afternoon trading in London, Premier Oil shares were up 34 percent at 61.83 pounds. The find also hands the government of President Enrique Pena Nieto, which ended state-oil firm Pemex's decades-long monopoly, a key victory as Mexico prepares to embark on fraught trade, security and immigration talks with U.S. President Donald Trump's administration.          Premier Oil's Chief Executive Tony Durrant said the discovery  adds materially  to Premier's portfolio of assets.  (The) Zama-1 discovery announcement appears about as material as we could possibly imagine at this early stage,  Jefferies analysts wrote in a note. The project is jointly owned with Talos Energy, which acts as operator and has a 35 percent stake, and Sierra Oil and Gas which holds the remaining 40 percent.  The Zama discovery by Talos is the most important achievement so far of the Mexico's Energy Reform. According to our data, Zama is one of the 20 largest shallow-water fields discovered globally in the past 20 years,  said Pablo Medina, an analyst at industry consultancy Wood Mackenzie.     Talos Energy is currently setting a liner to protect the discovered reservoirs, before drilling deeper to a total vertical depth of about 4,200 meters, Premier said. Pena Nieto championed the energy reform as a way to reverse an oil output slump dating back to 2004 and to kick-start long-lagging economic growth.  Later on Wednesday, Mexico will tender the latest batch of productive areas in the sixth auction open to private and foreign producers since the energy reform. Separately, Italian oil firm Eni said on Wednesday it was raising its oil estimate at its Amoca field off Mexico that it won as a production-sharing contract in a 2015 tender, to 1 billion barrels of oil equivalent.

Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt imposed sanctions on Qatar last month, accusing it of financing extremist groups and allying with the Gulf Arab states' arch-foe Iran, allegations Doha denies. Tillerson said the agreement signed with his Qatari counterpart, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani, had been under discussion for weeks.  The agreement which we both have signed on behalf of our governments represents weeks of intensive discussions between experts and reinvigorates the spirit of the Riyadh summit,  Tillerson said at a joint news conference with Sheikh Mohammed.  U.S. President Donald Trump met representatives of Arab states during a visit to Saudi Arabia in May.  The memorandum lays out a series of steps that each country will take in coming months and years to interrupt and disable terror financing flows and intensify counter terrorism activities globally,  Tillerson added. The four Arab states boycotting Qatar said later on Tuesday that sanctions would remain in place until it met their demands and that they would keep a close eye on the tiny Gulf monarchy's efforts to fight terrorism funding. In a joint statement released in their state media, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain said they appreciated U.S. efforts in fighting terrorism but that they would closely monitor Qatar's behavior.  Related CoverageEgypt says Qatar should be kicked out of anti Islamic State coalitionQatar says more Turkish troops have arrived at military baseKuwait's Emir says feels bitter over Gulf rift, to push ahead with mediationSheikh Mohammed said the agreement was not linked to the crisis with the four Arab countries, which the United States fears could impact its military and counter-terrorism operations and increase Iran's influence in the region.  Tehran has sent food supplies to Qatar and allows the country's carrier to fly through its airspace. Qatar denies it supports militant organizations and says the boycott is part of a campaign to rein in its independent foreign policy.  Today, the state of Qatar was the first to sign the executive program with the United States to fight terrorism financing,  Sheikh Mohammed told the news conference. Tillerson said the agreement includes milestones to ensure both countries are accountable through their commitments.

Egypt later said at a meeting of the U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State in Washington that the coalition should not include member states that supported terrorism, like Qatar. A U.S. official who had knowledge of the deliberations at the meeting later said  the other working group countries dismissed the Egyptian demand .  Terrorism is a global problem that requires a global response - and we all have work to do,” the U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said.  Slideshow (8 Images)Diplomacy Accompanied by Kuwaiti mediators, Tillerson flew to Doha on Tuesday for talks with the Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, over the crisis. He said he was due to travel to Saudi Arabia for talks with officials from the four Arab countries. On Monday, he and British National Security Advisor Mark Sedwill met with officials from Kuwait in order to patch up the row among the Western-allied countries.  Following those discussions, the United States, Britain and Kuwait urged all parties to resolve their dispute quickly through dialogue, Kuwait state news agency KUNA reported. Kuwait's ruler, Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah, expressed  bitterness  on Tuesday over what he described as an unprecedented rift in the Gulf, but said he intended to push ahead with mediation efforts. Foreign ministers from the four Arab states leading the boycott of Qatar will meet with Tillerson in the Saudi Arabian city of Jeddah on Wednesday.  Coming from some of the most influential powers in the dispute, the plea for a negotiated solution may be aimed at an earlier refusal by Qatar's adversaries to discuss renewing ties with Doha until it first acquiesced to a list of demands. They include closing the Al Jazeera TV channel, shutting a Turkish military base in Qatar and downgrading ties with Iran. Qatar hosts Udeid Air Base, the largest U.S. military facility in the Middle East, from which U.S.-led coalition aircraft stage sorties against Islamic State in Syria and Iraq.

Most Gulf currencies are pegged to the dollar and any monetary policy change in the United States is usually mimicked by Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar. In Saudi Arabia all 12 of the listed lenders advanced, half of them rising by 1 percent or more, helping to push the index 0.8 percent higher. Consumer-related shares also firmed on expectations of improving performance from the sector in the second quarter. Analysts at NCB Capital expect the government's decision to reinstate civil servants' allowances to lift average monthly household expenditure back to 11,523 riyals ($3,072.80), with discretionary spending growing by a quarter to 3,578 riyals. On June 20 the government said it will reinstate the public sector workers' allowance that had been cut in October 2016 because of pressure on state finances. Analysts said the food sector is likely to account for the biggest chunk of total spending but that they expect accelerating demand for home appliances. Shares in supermarket company Al Othaim -- NCB Capital's top pick in the consumer sector -- jumped 3.1 percent on Wednesday. United Electronics, meanwhile, gave up earlier gains, with its shares falling 1.8 percent on profit-taking. They remain 17 percent up since Monday, when it announced a surge in net profit, the board's recommendation to distribute its first cash dividend since 2015 and future product and online expansion plans. In Qatar, foreign traders made up a nearly a third of the total market turnover and they were net buyers by a modest margin, helping to boost the price of some of their favoured stocks. Lender Masraf Al Rayan climbed 4.4 percent. Forty other companies advanced and only one declined as the index jumped by 2.8 percent. The benchmark has now risen by 2.7 percent since the start of July but is down 6.5 percent since June 5, when Saudi Arabia and three other Arab states severed diplomatic and trade links with Doha. In the United Arab Emirates, Dubai's index gained 1.6 percent on the back of a 10.7 percent surge in shares of developer DAMAC Properties. Abu Dhabi's index was flat. Cairo's largest listed lender, Commercial International Bank , added 0.8 percent. The index finished flat, holding at a record closing high.

By all appearances, Kaspersky Lab happened to be dragged into a geopolitical fight where each side is trying to use the company as a pawn in its game,  RIA news agency quoted the company's press service as saying.

Earlier on Wednesday Turkish authorities detained 14 army officers and issued warrants for the detention of 51 people, including 34 former employees of state broadcaster TRT, for suspected links to the coup, local media reported.  There can be no question of lifting emergency rule with all this happening,  Erdogan said in a speech to investors in Ankara.  We will lift the emergency rule only when we no longer need to fight against terrorism.  He said the end of emergency rule could be possible  in the not-too-distant future , but gave no specific time frame. Ankara imposed the state of emergency soon after the coup attempt last July, when a group of rogue soldiers commandeered tanks, helicopters and warplanes and attacked parliament in a bid to overthrow the government, killing more than 240 people. Related CoverageErdogan appeals German court ruling that banned parts of satirical poemSince then, some 150,000 people have been sacked or suspended from the army, civil service and private sector and more than 50,000 detained for alleged links to the coup. Emergency rule allows the president and cabinet to bypass parliament in passing new laws and to limit or suspend rights and freedoms as they deem necessary. Critics say Erdogan is using the measures to quash dissent, while the government says they are necessary because of the gravity of the security threats Turkey faces. Military Purges Near End Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said on Wednesday that the purges in the military were probably coming to an end. Some 7,655 military personnel - including 150 generals and admirals and 4,287 officers - have been dismissed since the coup.   The military purge has been largely completed by the dismissal of soldiers across all ranks. This struggle will continue until the last FETO member has paid the price for their treason,  Yildirim told the same conference in Ankara. FETO is the term the government uses for the network of the U.S.-based Islamic cleric Fethullah Gulen it blames for the coup. Gulen, who has lived in self-imposed exile in the United States since 1999, has denied playing any role in the coup. Police killed five Islamic State militants in a dawn raid on a house in the central city of Konya on Wednesday, the local governor's office said, adding that four police officers were slightly wounded. There were suspicions that those killed may have been planning to target events being held this week to commemorate the first anniversary of the coup, according to the private Dogan news agency. A statement by the police said 233 suspected Islamic State members were detained in operations in 29 provinces across the country. Twenty-five of them were foreign nationals. Turkish security forces are also battling militants of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has waged a three-decade insurgency against the state that has resulted in more than 40,000 deaths.

Inga 3 is part of a $50 billion-$80 billion project to expand hydroelectric dams along the Congo River, but the project has repeatedly been delayed by red tape and disagreements between Congo and its partners on the project. A consortium led by China Three Gorges Corporation and another consortium that includes Spain's ACS (Actividades de Construccion y Servicios SA) have been vying to develop the project. They will now submit a joint bid on the expanded project in September, the project's director said on Wednesday. Bruno Kapandji, director of the Agency for the Development and Promotion of the Grand Inga Project, said the plant would be built to produce between 10,000 and 12,000 megawatts of power, more than double the originally planned capacity of 4,800 MW. Increased capacity would help meet rising power demand and bring down costs, he said, although he did not say how much the expanded project would cost.  The Chinese consortium, the Spanish-led ProInga consortium and civil society groups all seemed to agree that the 4.8 GW plan wouldn't be economically feasible. So the ProInga team came up with a radically different design,  said Elisabeth Caesens, an Open Society Fellow researching hydro power in Congo. The original $14 billion project struggled to attract financing and the World Bank last year suspended funding after the president's office took control of the project, raising transparency concerns at the Bank. The plant is projected to provide power for South Africa as well as mines and other consumers in Congo. However, campaign group International Rivers said last month that Inga 3 would incur massive debts and that the plant would deliver little to no electricity to consumers inside Congo because of transmission losses and because production would not meet its target.

The Outlook is Positive. The upgrade principally reflects GFH's improved financial position following the settlement of a number of pieces of litigation in connection with previous investment transactions and dealings, strengthening the institution's capital position and reducing associated legacy uncertainties. GFH is an Islamic investment bank, established in Bahrain in 1999 to focus in particular on investments in the GCC and MENA region, many of them in real estate. However, in the wake of the global economic crisis GFH has adjusted its strategy towards the creation of a more diversified financial services group, in which subsidiary Khaleeji Commercial Bank (KHCB) plays an important role. KEY RATING DRIVERS IDRS GFH's Long-Term IDR is based on Fitch's assessment of the group's intrinsic creditworthiness. As a wholesale-oriented bank we do not believe that sovereign support can be relied upon. The litigation settlement in 4Q16, reflected in exceptional income of USD464.6 million, allowed GFH in 2016 to report a much increased consolidated profit of USD233 million (2015: USD12 million), while also recognising impairment allowances of USD221.1 million (2015: USD17 million). GFH should now be left with a cleaner balance sheet as a result, but the charge illustrates the valuation volatility within the asset classes in which GFH has historically invested. The 2016 profit raised equity attributable to shareholders by 30% to USD908 million, and consolidated debt-to-tangible equity is low for a finance business at 1.9x (2015: 1.8x). This is appropriate, however, in view of the ongoing limited liquidity of a number of the group's assets, which include real estate projects whose completion and profitable exit could still pose challenges for GFH for some years. In 2015 and 2016 GFH paid down a substantial part of the secured debt previously held at parent level, significantly increasing its financial flexibility, although asset encumbrance remains. The Positive Outlook reflects Fitch's view of the measures GFH's current management has taken to reshape the group's business model towards a greater focus on income-generating investments, with consequent expectations of more consistent profitability. These include an increasing and generally more stable revenue contribution from commercial banking activities (including KHCB). Fitch also views positively Abu Dhabi Financial Group's presence as a significant shareholder, via its subsidiary, Integrated Capital PJSC. RATING SENSITIVITIES IDRS The ratings could be upgraded if GFH demonstrates a track record of stable profitability and cash flows from a business model less dependent on capital gains. Successful development of legacy real estate projects, and subsequent exit from these illiquid assets, could also be positive for the ratings. Resumed losses via impairment of the group's ongoing real estate exposure, or inability to liquidate other assets received as part of the litigation settlement at the values at which they have been recognised in the balance sheet, could result in the Outlook being revised to Stable, or, if severe, lead to a downgrade. Criteria Variation Fitch rates GFH principally under its Global Non-Bank Financial Institutions Rating Criteria, reflecting its non-bank investment activities. However, as GFH and its bank subsidiary KHCB are regulated by the Central Bank of Bahrain, Fitch has varied its criteria to assess regulation under its 'Global Bank Rating Criteria'. Fitch's assessment of regulation forms part of the overall assessment of operating environment. This variation has not resulted in any change to the rating.

Djibouti's position on the northwestern edge of the Indian Ocean has fuelled worry in India that it would become another of China's  string of pearls  of military alliances and assets ringing India, including Bangladesh, Myanmar and Sri Lanka. China began construction of a logistics base in Djibouti last year. It will be used to resupply navy ships taking part in peacekeeping and humanitarian missions off the coasts of Yemen and Somalia, in particular. It will be China's first overseas naval base, though Beijing officially describes it as a logistics facility. State news agency Xinhua said late on Tuesday the ships had departed from Zhanjiang in southern China  to set up a support base in Djibouti . Navy commander Shen Jinlong  read an order on constructing the base in Djibouti , but the news agency did not say when the base would begin operations. Xinhua said the establishment of the base was a decision made by the two countries after  friendly negotiations, and accords with the common interest of the people from both sides .  The base will ensure China's performance of missions, such as escorting, peace-keeping and humanitarian aid in Africa and west Asia,  it said.  The base will also be conducive to overseas tasks including military cooperation, joint exercises, evacuating and protecting overseas Chinese and emergency rescue, as well as jointly maintaining security of international strategic seaways,  Xinhua said. Foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told a daily news briefing the base would enable China to make  new and greater contributions  to peace in Africa and the world and would benefit Djibouti's economic development.

The tiny, barren nation sandwiched between Ethiopia, Eritrea and Somalia also hosts U.S., Japanese and French bases. 'Not Military Expansionism' The People's Liberation Army Daily said in a front-page commentary the facility was a landmark that would increase China's ability to ensure global peace, especially because it had so many U.N. peacekeepers in Africa and was so involved in anti-piracy patrols. Soldiers of China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) salute from a ship sailing off from a military port in Zhanjiang, Guangdong province, July 11, 2017.StringerChina would not seek military expansionism or get into arms races no matter what happened, the newspaper said.  These promises will not change because of the construction of the overseas logistics base,  it said. The state-run Global Times said in an editorial there could be no mistake that this was in fact a military base.  Certainly this is the People's Liberation Army's first overseas base and we will base troops there. It's not a commercial resupply point. It makes sense there is attention on this from foreign public opinion,  said the paper, which is published by the official People's Daily. China's military development was about protecting its own security, it said.   It's not about seeking to control the world.  There has been persistent speculation in diplomatic circles that China would build other such bases, in Pakistan for example, but the government has dismissed this.

The unsecured notes are unconditionally guaranteed by the majority-owned Cencosud Retail S.A. Proceeds from the 10-year offering will be used to repay existing bank and bond debt (including the tender offer of the 2021 and 2023 notes), extending the company's debt maturity profile KEY RATING DRIVERS Diversified Business Model: Cencosud's ratings reflect its strong business profile as a geographically diversified, multi-format retailer in South America. It enjoys critical size in the food segment and benefits from a significant presence in the non-food retail segment. The company's stable EBITDA margin and high level of unencumbered assets related to its real estate segment also are viewed positively. Constraining factors include its high exposure to Argentina (26% of adjusted EBITDA) and the poor performance by its operations in Brazil and low margin in Colombia. Expected Deleveraging: Cencosud's adjusted gross leverage, as measured by total adjusted debt/EBITDAR (excluding banking) was 4.6x as of Dec. 31, 2016. Fitch expects the company to reduce its consolidated adjusted gross leverage (excluding banking) towards 4x in 2018 due to increased EBITDA and asset divestments. The company's adjusted debt ratios for the retail and shopping malls business remained broadly stable at about 4x and 5.1x respectively. Fitch anticipates non-core asset disposals that would accelerate deleveraging in 2017. Neutral FCF: Fitch expects Cencosud to generate neutral to slightly negative free cash flow (FCF) due to improved EBITDA (efficiencies) and lower dividends at FYE17. In FYE16, the group generated negative FCF due to lower cash flow from operations and higher dividends. The company paid an extraordinary dividends of about USD220 million in 2016. Fitch assumes capex of about USD500 million in 2017 compared to USD317 million in 2016, as the company is growing organically and investing in IT and omnichannel. Cencosud is contemplating capex of USD2.5 billion between 2017 and 2020. Margin Trend Is Key: Cencosud's main operational challenges are to grow its businesses and improve margins, despite the weak consumer environment in the region. This is a direct result of slow economic growth in Latin America and high inflation in markets such as Argentina. Fitch expects the company to resume single-digit revenue growth due to the gradual improvement of the economic environment in the regions in which the company operates, notably Argentina and Brazil. KEY ASSUMPTIONS --High-single-digit revenue growth in 2017; --EBITDA of 7.3%; --Gross adjusted gross leverage - including retail, shopping malls and banking operations - toward 4x in FYE18; --Fitch does not factor in the potential spin-off of shopping malls; --Capex of USD500 million in 2017. RATING SENSITIVITIES Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a negative rating action include: --Sustained negative FCF; --Group EBITDA margin consistently below 7%; --Lease-adjusted gross leverage - excluding banking operation (Banco Peru) sustained above 4.5x; --Leased-adjusted gross retail leverage (including shopping malls) above 4x. Conversely, Fitch may take a positive rating action if a combination of the following factors takes place: --Consistently positive FCF generation, reflected in FCF margin around 3%-5%; --EBITDA margin consistently above 8%; --Lease adjusted gross leverage - excluding banking (Banco Peru) below 3.5x; --Lease-adjusted gross retail leverage (including shopping malls) below 3x; --Decreased exposure to Argentina's sovereign risk. LIQUIDITY Liquidity is adequate due to the company cash position, its good access to capital markets and manageable debt maturities. Cencosud had cash and cash equivalents, respectively, of about USD522 million and USD553 million in short-term debt. As of March 31, 2017, roughly 67% of consolidated financial debt was denominated in U.S. dollars; 77.4% of total financial debt was covered using cross currency swaps or other exchange rate hedges. Considering the effect of the cross currency swaps, as of March 31, 2017, the company's exposure to the U.S. dollar was 15.3% of the total debt. Fitch currently rates Cencosud S.A. as follows: --Long-Term Foreign Currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'BBB-'; --Long-Term Local Currency IDR 'BBB-'; --USD750 million unsecured notes due in 2021 'BBB-'; --USD1.2 billion unsecured notes due in 2023 'BBB-; --USD650 million unsecured notes due in 2025 'BBB-; --USD350 million unsecured notes due in 2045 'BBB-'.

Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi's victory announcement signaled the biggest defeat for the hardline Sunni group since its lightning sweep through northern Iraq three years ago. But pockets of Mosul remain insecure and the city has been heavily damaged by nearly nine months of grueling urban combat. About 900,000 people fled the fighting, with more than a third sheltered in camps outside Iraq's second largest city and the rest living with family and friends in other neighborhoods.  Civilian activity has quickly returned to much of Mosul and work is underway to repair damaged homes and infrastructure, something the United Nations estimates will initially cost more than $1 billion. Newly trained local police are deployed in Mosul alongside the military, but authorities have not prepared a post-battle plan for governance and security in the city, officials say. Iraqi forces exchanged gunfire with the militants in their final Mosul redoubt just before midnight and through the day on Wednesday, three residents living just across the Tigris River from the area told Reuters. Army helicopters strafed the Old City and columns of smoke rose into the air, though it was unclear if these came from controlled explosions or bombs set off by Islamic State, the residents said by phone.  We still live in an atmosphere of war despite the victory announcement two days ago,  said Fahd Ghanim, 45. Another resident said the blasts shook the ground around half a kilometer away. An Iraqi military official attributed the activity to  clearing operations .  Daesh is hiding in different places,  he said, using an acronym for Islamic State.  They disappear here and pop up there, then we target them.   Media access to the area has been heavily restricted since Abadi claimed victory on Monday, hailing  the collapse of the terrorist state . Footage released by Islamic State news agency Amaq entitled  Fighting till the last gasp  and allegedly filmed in Mosul's Maydan district showed militants mixed in with civilians and unidentified corpses lying amid the rubble of an urban battlefield. Reuters could not authenticate the video. Asymmetric Attacks Smoke rises from clashes in the Old City of Mosul, Iraq July 10, 2017.Thaier Al-SudaniThousands of civilians have been killed during the Mosul offensive. Many were targeted by Islamic State but rights groups have also accused Iraqi forces and the U.S.-led coalition backing them of killings that violated international humanitarian law. On Tuesday, Amnesty International cited a reliance on weapons it said had only crude targeting capabilities. The coalition strongly rejected the charges, and Abadi, without mentioning Amnesty, said in a statement on Wednesday that rights groups should check their sources. The Iraqi official declined to estimate the number of militants or civilians remaining in the Old City, but the top U.S. general in Iraq said on Tuesday that as many as a couple of hundred IS insurgents could still be in Mosul.  There are bypassed holdouts. We haven't cleared every building in this city the size of Philadelphia. That's going to have to be done, and there are also hidden IEDs (improvised explosive devices),  Lieutenant General Stephen Townsend told reporters.  There are still going to be losses from the Iraqi security forces as they continue to secure Mosul.  The coalition said it had conducted three air strikes on IS in the Mosul area on Tuesday, targeting militants, machine-gun emplacements and rocket-propelled grenade systems. South of the city, Iraqi security forces repelled an IS attack launched from western desert areas on the village of al-Jaran, a tribal fighter said. Reinforcements also arrived to help government forces oust  militants armed with machine guns and mortars from the village of Imam Gharbi, further to the south. A policeman was killed and two others wounded in clashes on Wednesday, a security official said. IS has taken more than 75 percent of the village since storming it last week. These are the kind of asymmetric, guerrilla-style strikes Islamic State is expected to concentrate on now as U.S.-backed Iraqi forces regain control over cities the group captured during its shock 2014 offensive. Another attack on a border guard convoy in western Anbar province, near the Syrian border, killed two soldiers and wounded four on Tuesday, military sources said. Separately, 28 Sunni Muslim civilians were kidnapped in the Iskandariya district south of Baghdad this week and 20 of them were found dead later, a police officer told Reuters. Suspects detained by the authorities said they belonged to the Shi'ite Muslim Asaib Ahl al-Haq militia. A Baghdad-based spokesman for the group, whose fighters are taking part in the Shi'ite-led government's campaign against Islamic State, said he had no knowledge of the incident. The government's victory in Mosul may rekindle revenge attacks and fresh violence between Sunnis and Shi'ites, a  sectarian divide that tipped Iraq into civil war after the U.S.-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein in 2003.

Eighteen Myanmar nationals and foreigners representing international media, including Reuters, arrived in the state capital of Sittwe on Wednesday ahead of a government-escorted visit to the northern areas of Buthidaung and Maungdaw, where most residents are stateless Rohingyas.  There are no restrictions regarding the areas that you can report from,  said Thet Swe, a director at the Ministry of Information's News and Periodicals Enterprise.   We didn't arrange any 'for show' places for news reporting,  he said. Last year, Myanmar's army unleashed a crackdown in the area after Rohingya militants attacked posts near the Bangladesh border, killing nine police officers.  Some 75,000 people fled across the nearby border to Bangladesh, according to the United Nations, which has documented allegations of gang rape, torture, arson and killings by security forces. Myanmar's government, led by Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, has denied most of the allegations, and has denied entry to a U.N. fact-finding mission tasked with looking into the allegations.  The government has blocked independent journalists and human rights monitors from going to the area in the far north of the state for the past nine months. Suu Kyi has said a U.N. fact-finding mission would only heighten tension in the region. Many in Buddhist-majority Myanmar, see the Rohingya as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh.  Myanmar officials say a domestic investigation, led by Vice President Myint Swe - a former lieutenant general in the army - and a commission headed for former U.N. chief Kofi Annan - which is not mandated to investigate human rights abuses - are the appropriate ways to address problems in Rakhine State. Security Concerns Annan recommended in March that authorities  provide full and regular access for domestic and international media to all areas affected by recent violence . Reporters on the visit to the northern areas would be provided security by Myanmar's paramilitary Border Guard Police force, Thet Swe said. Although access would not be restricted, he said, reporters should stay close to officials during visits to villages for their own security. A detailed itinerary for the five-day trip was provided to reporters on Wednesday. The itinerary does not include visits to the villages at the center of a two-week offensive in mid-November, in which Reuters has documented numerous allegations of abuses by troops following a clash with Rohingya militants. However, Thet Swe said, the plan was  not fixed  and would be subject to changes due to the weather and security concerns. He invited reporters to suggest additional places they want to visit. Reporters would be taken to the village of Tin May, where security forces killed two suspected militants and arrested one after they detonated a bomb on Sunday, according to an announcement from Suu Kyi's office. While Myanmar has denied entry to a U.N. fact-finding mission, a U.N. special rapporteur on human rights, Yanghee Lee, is visiting Rakhine State this week. Although she is not expected to visit the northern areas near the border with Bangladesh, she is due to meet some of the people displaced in violence since 2012. About 120,000 Rohingya have lived in  internally displaced persons  camps in Rakhine State, dependent of international aid, since communal widespread violence that year.

Fitch has also affirmed PDT's Short-Term Foreign Currency IDR at 'F2'. Its unsecured bond issues have been affirmed at 'BBB+' while those guaranteed by the Province of Trento (PAT, A-/Stable) have been affirmed at 'A-'. The affirmation reflects the unchanged strategic importance that PDT holds for its sole shareholder, PAT, in the implementation of the latter's real estate strategy for the province. The ratings also reflect the strong credit links between PDT and PAT through the province's funding support for PDT's debt servicing, while exercising extensive control and oversight over the company, which is underlined in Fitch's top down rating approach. The notching difference between PDT and PAT reflects that the guarantee from the province currently covers only part of PDT's financial liabilities and that PDT's debt is not consolidated into PAT's accounts. The Stable Outlook reflects Fitch's expectations that the framework in which PDT operates will remain unchanged and that the company will continue to play a major role in PAT's strategy. KEY RATING DRIVERS Strategic Important Link with Sponsor: PDT is the real estate arm of a network of public service entities (PSEs) controlled by PAT and also a vehicle used to deploy PAT's public investment strategy in multiple sectors such as transportation, real estate, finance, technology and investments. PDT's real estate portfolio focuses on prime and secondary properties, as well as asset rationalisation as mandated by the province. Debt servicing is regularly subsidised by the province, underlining strong financial support from PAT. Strong Provincial Oversight: As with all other PSEs, PDT's investment strategy is strongly driven by the sponsor. The province has recently outlined a plan to streamline the number of PSEs to increase efficiencies and reduce costs, which will result in the merger of PDT with Trento Fiere - another small PSE that is active in fairs and manages EUR8 million of assets - expected in 2017. In Fitch's view, PDT remains instrumental to the province's real estate strategy given the growing number of quality projects for social housing and the large portfolio of assets managed on behalf of the province. Despite a tepid recovery of the real estate market in the province, PDT maintains a sound quality portfolio with minimal impairments of assets centred on fairs, sport facilities, hospitals and libraries, which are less exposed to price volatility. Over a three-year horizon, Fitch expects PDT to be supported by a recurring stream of revenue from rents of EUR8 million-EUR9 million, albeit mostly below market rates, and modest opportunistic asset disposals (about EUR10 million), which remain challenged by a sluggish real estate market in the province. The company's real estate portfolio under management will expand to over EUR600 million by 2019, following projected EUR130 million new investments approved by the province over 2017-2019. Funding will be provided by a combination of transfers from the province and new debt in the form of bonds or loans, which will reach EUR220 million over the next three years. Moderate Integration with Sponsor: PDT's financial profile is conservative with healthy cash generation and liquidity relying on cash balances (EUR17 million at end-2016) that are sufficient to pay a regular EUR1 million dividend to the sponsor. Debt servicing is subsidised by PAT with about 75% of PDT's debt being guaranteed by the province.  PDT's debt, however, is not consolidated into PAT's financials, which leads Fitch to assess PDT's integration attribute as mid-range. Mid-Range Legal Status: PDT is a limited-liability company fully owned and controlled by PAT and acts as a department of the latter. The company can be liquidated in which case its assets will be repossessed by the province. Furthermore, PDT is subject to Italian bankruptcy law and company by-laws restrict ownership by PAT to a minimum of two-thirds of PDT's equity, and the remainder to public entities only (i.e., the province, Trento's municipalities and provincial companies). Fitch therefore judges the entity's legal link with the sponsor as moderately supportive of PDT's credit quality. RATING SENSITIVITIES As PDT's IDR is credit-linked to PAT it is sensitive to a rating action on the province. More formalised support from the province, such as an explicit guarantee on all financial liabilities, could trigger a positive action on PDT's ratings, leading to a rating equalisation with PAT. Conversely a dilution of provincial support as evidenced by material unsubsidised borrowing or income losses not compensated by support from PAT may lead to a downgrade, thereby widening PDT's rating differential from the sponsor to two notches.

In an effort to speed up the unloading of bad debt by banks, EU finance ministers on Tuesday approved a blueprint to create national  asset management companies  that could help develop the market for bad loans.  We believe such a measure would potentially be useful,  Visco said in a speech to the Italian banking association.  For it to be truly successful, the assets should be transferred at a price not too far from their real economic value; banks should take up the scheme voluntarily; the features of restructuring plans by banks participating should be agreed in advance,  he added. A harsh recession which ended in 2014 saddled Italian banks with 349 billion euros ($400 billion) in impaired debts, one third of Europe's total. Banks have been slow to sell bad loans as a gap between their book value and prices investors are ready to pay means they can only be sold at a loss. At the same time, a clogged judicial system means recovery procedures take years. Visco warned that slow repossessions would become an even bigger issue for Italian banks if the EU decided to apply rules, currently under discussion, forcing lenders to meet mininum provision levels on loans turning sour.  Data Italian banks must improve the quality of bad loan data as key information on collateral is sometimes still missing, despite the Bank of Italy's efforts to force lenders to tidy up their loan records, Visco said.  The quality of information, initially low, has got better ... (but) there are further margins for improvement,  he said. He said data could help banks more actively manage doubtful loans before borrowers become insolvent so that they could either help them get back on their feet or, if necessary, raise provisions. Provisions on average cover 62 percent of the value of loans to insolvent borrowers while the coverage of so-called 'unlikely-to-pay' loans - the stage before default - is just 33 percent.  The Bank of Italy favors a scenario in which banks work out their non-performing loans internally, without selling them, and the various moves being suggested should improve banks' ability to do just that,  said Andrea Resti, who advises the European parliament on banking supervision.

Giving its first 2018 forecasts in a monthly report, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries said the world will need 32.20 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude from its members next year, down 60,000 bpd from this year. OPEC said its oil output in June rose above the demand forecast, led by gains in Libya and Nigeria, two members exempt from the cut aimed at eliminating excess supply. OPEC officials nonetheless remain upbeat on the outlook.  We remain very optimistic ... (about) helping the market to rebalance itself,  OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo said at an industry conference in Istanbul. Oil LCOc1 rose above $48 a barrel on Wednesday as a U.S. report of falling inventories in the United States raised hopes that the glut is easing. OPEC referred to an  ongoing rebalancing  of the market. Under the supply deal, OPEC is curbing output by about 1.2 million bpd, while Russia and other non-OPEC producers are cutting half as much, until March 2018. OPEC production has increased in recent weeks, in part due to the recovery in Libya and Nigeria, which were exempted from the supply cut as domestic conflict had curbed their output. OPEC said its output rose by 393,000 bpd in June to 32.611 million bpd, according to figures from secondary sources the organization uses to monitor supply. The gain was led by Nigeria and Libya, with extra barrels also from Saudi Arabia and Iraq.    The figures mean OPEC has complied 96 percent with the cutback pledge, according to a Reuters calculation, down from more than 100 percent in May but still high by OPEC standards.  We are fully satisfied that member countries are maintaining a very high level of conformity,  Barkindo said. Saudi, Others Pump More The report also said Saudi Arabia, which earlier this year voluntarily cut production to below its OPEC goal, boosted output to 10.07 million bpd in June, slightly above target.  Supply is rising outside the group as well. OPEC estimated supply from all non-OPEC producers next year will rise by 1.14 million bpd, a sizeable increase from growth of 800,000 bpd this year led by the United States. Next year's growth in non-OPEC supply is almost as much as the 1.26 million bpd rise that OPEC expects in global demand, and is even more if OPEC output of natural gas liquids - a type of supply not restricted by OPEC quotas - is included.  The United States is expected to contribute the largest non-OPEC supply gain next year, OPEC said, even though cost inflation and a decline in well productivity will curb shale oil activity. Canada and Brazil are also expected to boost output. Should OPEC keep pumping at similar levels to June, the market could remain in surplus next year, the report indicates. The Nigerian and Libyan recovery has prompted talk among producers about asking them to join the supply deal. Barkindo downplayed expectations this would be addressed soon, saying a meeting on July 24 in Russia of some OPEC and non-OPEC ministers would discuss Nigerian and Libyan output only at a technical level. OPEC production figures in the report are for the now 14-member group. Equatorial Guinea joined in late May.

In an effort to speed up the unloading of bad debt by banks, EU finance ministers on Tuesday approved a blueprint to create national  asset management companies  that could help develop the market for bad loans.  We believe such a measure would potentially be useful,  Visco said in a speech to the Italian banking association.  For it to be truly successful, the assets should be transferred at a price not too far from their real economic value; banks should take up the scheme voluntarily; the features of restructuring plans by banks participating should be agreed in advance,  he added. A harsh recession which ended in 2014 saddled Italian banks with 349 billion euros ($400 billion) in impaired debts, one third of Europe's total. Banks have been slow to sell bad loans as a gap between their book value and prices investors are ready to pay means they can only be sold at a loss. At the same time, a clogged judicial system means recovery procedures take years. Visco warned that slow repossessions would become an even bigger issue for Italian banks if the EU decided to apply rules, currently under discussion, forcing lenders to meet mininum provision levels on loans turning sour.  Data Italian banks must improve the quality of bad loan data as key information on collateral is sometimes still missing, despite the Bank of Italy's efforts to force lenders to tidy up their loan records, Visco said.  The quality of information, initially low, has got better ... (but) there are further margins for improvement,  he said. He said data could help banks more actively manage doubtful loans before borrowers become insolvent so that they could either help them get back on their feet or, if necessary, raise provisions. Provisions on average cover 62 percent of the value of loans to insolvent borrowers while the coverage of so-called 'unlikely-to-pay' loans - the stage before default - is just 33 percent.  The Bank of Italy favors a scenario in which banks work out their non-performing loans internally, without selling them, and the various moves being suggested should improve banks' ability to do just that,  said Andrea Resti, who advises the European parliament on banking supervision. Visco urged hundreds of small cooperative banks that are set to merge into two large groups to book any loan losses this year, ahead of a check-up the European Central Bank will conduct on their assets in the first half of 2018.

At least 80 people are missing or presumed dead from  Britain's deadliest fire in decades which swept through the 24-storey housing block on June 14. London Police have confirmed that 255 residents survived the fire. Police Sergeant Alistair Hutchins, one of two specialists leading the disaster victim identification (DVI) team which includes six archaeologists, said the task was psychologically arduous.  We've never had an incident to this scale,  he said in a videoed interview released by London Metropolitan Police on Wednesday.  The pressures it puts on you emotionally are huge. The DVI team are all volunteers and to ask them to enter a building like this and deal with the stuff they're finding is a big task for them.  Detective Superintendent Fiona McCormack, the officer in charge of the police investigation, told Reuters last month that officers were  many months from being able to provide a number that we believe accurately represents the total loss of life . Hutchins said the team were sifting through the debris to find the smallest human fragments from the fire which he said was the worst incident he had faced in his 18-year career in DIV.  Those sieves are going down to a six mm size so that we guarantee that we can pick up small fragments of bone, teeth, any identifiable part of the human body we will pick up at that stage,  he said. Hutchins also acknowledged the anger expressed by friends and relatives of the victims and those missing about the pace of the effort to locate and identify those who died in the fire.  I understand how frustrating it is for people outside of this environment to sit there and wait and say, 'well, why can't I have my family back? Surely it's easy.' And it's not.

Ratings agency Moody's said in a statement late on Tuesday that the United Kingdom's creditworthiness was under pressure following last year's vote to leave the EU and the ongoing uncertainty over the outcome of negotiations with Brussels. That comes at a time when the Conservative government is under pressure, following the shock loss of its majority last month. The likely next leader of the pro-EU Liberal Democrats, Vince Cable, said on Tuesday that Britain was heading towards a new economic crisis which could raise popular support for anti-Brexit parties. At the same time, economic indicators have suggested Britain is already struggling to gain momentum after a sluggish start to the year, while consumer and business sentiment has soured. Amid the resulting falls for the pound, several of the Bank of England's monetary policy panel stepped in to warn it may raise rates soon, temporarily lifting the currency before it slipped back.        I really have not liked sterling for a while,  said State Street's head of macro strategy for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, Tim Graf.  The consumer is not taking up the slack as... previously.    The only thing that has been supporting the pound is the idea that the BoE might hike rates. If we continue to see (weak data), I can't see how they can.   August Hike  Unrealistic ? BoE Deputy Governor Ben Broadbent said in a newspaper interview published on Wednesday he was  not ready  to raise rates yet, driving sterling to a two-week low against the dollar and 8-month low against the euro  in early trade before the labour market report improved the mood. [nL8N1K31PX] The data showed British workers saw their pay fall further behind inflation in the three months to May, though wages rose marginally more than had been expected.  For anyone who had any expectation of an August hike - that is clearly looking very unrealistic now,  said MUFG analyst Lee Hardman, while adding:  He does reinforce that they are moving towards a hike. That will help keep alive expectations for a move later this year.  By 1210 GMT, the pound was trading 0.2 percent stronger on the day at $1.2873, having earlier weakened to $1.2812. It also gained 0.4 percent to 88.91 pence per euro.  Sterling fell back to as low as $1.26 in the two weeks after Prime Minister Theresa May unexpectedly lost her parliamentary majority in last month's snap election, but it remains some 10 cents above lows hit in a flash crash last October.  Top executives at five of the largest banks in London told Reuters a staggered deal on leaving the European Union is only likely to be agreed late on in talks with Brussels, meaning they have already begun relocating staff. With those sorts of Brexit-related blows potentially in store for the months ahead, many economists say the British economy is far from ready to deal with higher interest rates and much recent data continues to weigh against the pound.  However, Nomura strategist Jordan Rochester, one of the market's most prominent sterling bulls, predicted the currency would reach $1.37 by the end of this year.  He said Broadbent's words still left room for officials to opt at the August meeting to remove the extra emergency stimulus given to the economy after the Brexit vote last year. That would prod interest rates back to 0.5 percent and offer some support to the pound.

The Bank of Canada is widely expected to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly seven years, following the U.S. Federal Reserve in trying to inch them back to normal after the global financial crisis a decade ago.                  But the rapid climb in Canadian yields since the Bank of Canada turned hawkish last month may have gone far enough for the central bank, which is also concerned about risks to financial stability. Higher yields are already pushing up borrowing costs for highly indebted Canadians.                       At 8:55 a.m. ET (1255 GMT), the Canadian dollar          was trading unchanged at C$1.2915 to the greenback, or 77.43 U.S. cents.     The currency traded in a range of C$1.2894 to C$1.2941.     Prices of oil, one of Canada's major exports, climbed after data showed a fall in U.S. fuel inventories and the U.S. government lowered its forecast for crude output.                  U.S. crude        was up 2.0 percent at $45.94 a barrel.     The U.S. dollar        lost ground after the release of Fed Chair Janet Yellen's prepared testimony to be delivered to Congress Wednesday morning.

Canadian government bond prices were higher across the yield curve in sympathy with U.S. Treasuries. The two-year            price rose 9 Canadian cents to yield 1.11 percent, and the 10-year             climbed 38 Canadian cents to yield 1.85 percent.     On Tuesday, the 10-year yield touched its highest since June 2015 at 1.903 percent.

Fitch has also affirmed TT's Short-Term Foreign Currency IDR at 'F2'. The ratings of TT are credit linked to, and notched off once from, those of the Autonomous Province of Trento (PAT; A-/Stable). The ratings primarily reflect the strategic importance TT represents for its 73% shareholder, PAT and the extensive control by and financial support from its sponsor. TT is rated using a top-down approach under Fitch's criteria for rating public-sector entities outside the U.S. The one-notch differential between TT and PAT mainly reflects the lack of consolidation of TT's debt within PAT's financials. KEY RATING DRIVERS Strong Strategic Importance: TT is a pivotal vehicle for implementing PAT's transportation services, is one of the public sector entities (PSEs) that are tightly managed by PAT and receives funding from the province for investments. As mandated by provincial law, TT leases out rolling stock, bus fleets and cable cars for public service to Trentino Trasporti Esercizio (TTE), a fully owned company of the province, based on a service agreement that expires in 2017. Under the public service scheme adopted by PAT, TT's revenue is driven by rental income, which combined with PAT's subsidies, accounted for nearly 80% of TT's total revenue in 2016. As part of a restructuring of the province's PSEs, PAT plans to merge TT and TTE and the local small airport to achieve synergies, cost savings and improve governance. The merger will be effective from 1 January 2018. As TTE is debt-free the merger should not result in a material impact on the combined entity's financial profile provided that PAT's financial support scheme remains unchanged. Strong Control, Mid-range Integration: TT acts under tight supervision from PAT. Board members of TT and TTE are mostly appointed by the province to ensure ease of strategy implementation for the public service sector. Under the provincial financial scheme PSEs such as TT fund their investments with their own debt that are subsidised or guaranteed by the province. The track record of funding from PAT to support TT's capex and its guarantees to back TT's loans underpin Fitch's view that extraordinary support from the province is highly likely in case of need, hence limiting the rating differential to one notch. PAT is a full guarantor of TT's EUR70 million loans with the European Investment Bank (EIB) although TT's debt is not consolidated within PAT's accounts. Legal Status Mid-range: Fitch views TT's legal links with the sponsor as mid-range and therefore moderately supportive of the company's credit quality. TT's by-law, whose modification would require PAT's approval, stipulates that the province's stake - alone or together with other public entities - cannot fall below 51% of TT's equity from the current 73% shareholding. TT plans to invest nearly EUR120 million over 2017-2019, mainly to upgrade its railway network, trains and the bus depot system and to purchase trains and buses. Funding will come from a combination of sponsor-provided capital transfers, drawings under existing facilities with EIB and market debt backed by a full and an unconditional guarantee from the province. As a result, Fitch expects TT's debt to exceed EUR115 million by 2019, putting pressure on the company's liquidity over the medium term. However, these funding requirements will not add material pressure to PAT as total risk from its PSE network represents less than 10% of the province's revenue. RATING SENSITIVITIES As TT's IDR is credit-linked to the province's rating, it is sensitive to changes to the province's ratings. A dilution of provincial support as evidenced by material unsubsidised borrowing or income losses not compensated by support from PAT may lead to a downgrade, thereby widening the rating differential between TT and PAT to two notches. Consolidation of TT's debt into PAT's budget and full guarantee from the province on all of TT's financial liabilities may lead to an upgrade.

When the ANC picks Zuma's successor in December, unionist-turned-business tycoon Ramaphosa is expected to face off against veteran politician Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, former African Union chairwoman and Zuma's ex-wife. Ramaphosa is viewed as more investor friendly and has pledged to fight the corruption that has plagued Zuma's tenure. Dlamini-Zuma appeals to ANC grassroots and has the support of Zuma's well-established patronage network. Zuma's business friends, the Guptas, have been accused by ANC politicians and the opposition of using their close relationship with Zuma and his allies to influence the awarding of government contracts worth hundreds of millions of dollars. The Guptas, Indian-born South Africans, and Zuma deny wrongdoing. Local media last month, citing leaked emails from Gupta-controlled companies, said millions of dollars of state-funds were diverted in 2013 to pay for a four-day Gupta family wedding at the luxury Sun City resort outside Johannesburg. Zuma has said that a flurry of media reports in the last six weeks based on a massive leak of emails from Gupta companies are speculation. In his strongest statement to date against the Guptas, Ramaphosa disagreed with his boss.  We know that we as tax payers of this country paid for a lavish wedding that took place in Sun City,  Ramaphosa told members of the South African Communist Party, which has called for Zuma to step down over a string of corruption scandals.  I Will Not Remain Quiet   We also know that these are resources that rightly belong to the people of South Africa. Should we remain quiet when all this happens? I am one of those who will not remain quiet.  Ramaphosa called for a judicial inquiry into what is known locally as  state-capture  because of allegations that many parts of the government are involved. A Gupta family spokesman and a Zuma's spokesman did not respond to request for comment. London-based public relations firm Bell Pottinger apologized last week and said it had suspended a partner after it was accused of stirring racial tensions in a PR campaign it ran while working for the Guptas.   Bell Pottinger ended their relationship with Gupta-owned Oakbay in April.   In its advice to Zuma's son Duduzane, director of a Gupta company, Bell Pottinger stressed the need to highlight the  existence of economic apartheid . This preceded Zuma and Dlamini-Zuma's supporters publicly saying that  state capture  investigations should focus on white-owned businesses and attacked their opponents in the ANC as being agents of  white monopoly capital . Ramaphosa hit back on Wednesday.  It is a matter of grave concern that a public relations company from outside of our country was able to so effectively poison the political discourse in our country,  he said.

The fund will try to connect startup companies with its corporate investors, which include big automotive suppliers BorgWarner Inc and Autoliv Inc, and two unidentified automakers, Autotech founders Quin Garcia and Alexei Andreev told Reuters ahead of Wednesday's announcement of the fund. The fund already has investments in ride service company Lyft; Outdoorsy, which enables users to share recreational vehicles; and Work Truck Solutions, which designs software to help owners of commercial truck fleets track their vehicles.  Older transportation companies are looking for ideas on how to make money from vehicles after the initial sale, such as through sharing services. They also are interested in startups that could help them use data acquired from vehicles to sell insurance or locate and pay for parking, Garcia and Andreev said. The new Autotech Ventures fund comes as vehicle manufacturers and suppliers are scouring the technology sector for talent and ideas but are wary of overpaying.  General Motors Co's estimated $1 billion acquisition of self-driving vehicle company Cruise Automation and Uber Technologies Inc's [UBER.UL] purchase of self-driving truck startup Otto have accelerated this trend. In the self-driving vehicle arena, the Autotech Ventures fund will focus on companies developing specific technology, “rather than a jack of all trades,” Garcia said.   Autotech Ventures has invested in Deepscale, a startup developing technology that processes the information a car gets from sensors about the surrounding environment but is not trying to build an entire operating system for an autonomous vehicle.

That commitment is now being put to the test in one of the company's most important international projects: building a low-cost car for India. Mueller said in March he was giving the job to the group's Czech brand Skoda, which is now leading partnership talks with India's Tata Motors (TAMO.NS). Skoda has been authorized to take  incremental  decisions, while keeping Wolfsburg informed, a source at the brand said.  The move, the first major international project led by Skoda since Volkswagen (VW) took full control of it in 2000, is a sign of how the different divisions and regions within the 12-brand VW (VOWG_p.DE) empire are gaining influence, the source added.  Mueller's nine-member management team has also started to hold regular meetings outside of its northern German home, with the first one abroad held in Shanghai in April.  Sharing out power is important because many people both inside and outside VW believe the company's traditional authoritarian management structure created the environment that led to engineers installing illegal software to cheat diesel emissions tests in millions of cars worldwide.  With staff focused on meeting targets set by remote bosses and too fearful to highlight problems, VW was plunged into the biggest business crisis in its 80-year history when the cheating was exposed in September 2015 - a crisis that has so far cost it more than $25 billion in fines, compensation and vehicle refits.  Some VW investors say there were other causes of the crisis - in particular that the company was not open enough to outside scrutiny. They want it to appoint more independent directors to oversee executives, and hire more managers from outside the group, rather than filling top jobs with company veterans.   So far Mueller, who has been at VW for 40 years and became CEO a week after the emissions scandal erupted, has rejected calls to overhaul its supervisory and management boards. VW has also not, as originally promised, published the report it commissioned from a U.S. law firm into the emissions scandal, saying there are no written findings and it is unable to do so under the terms of a settlement with U.S. authorities.   But Mueller's decentralization drive may help to win over some investors - particularly if it boosts financial results.  The Rewards of Change Analysts say Wolfsburg's grip over the world's biggest carmaker has been responsible for some of its failings in key markets. These include the United States, where VW has struggled to adapt to local tastes, and also building a budget car for emerging markets, where Wolfsburg engineers steeped in technical excellence missed cost targets, VW sources have said. VW's low-cost Lupo model was dropped from production after less than a decade due to weak demand worldwide, while a small car partnership with Suzuki Motor Corp. (7269.T) collapsed.  Skoda, which built cheap runabouts during the Czech Republic's Communist era, is studying whether it can adapt a low-cost production platform developed by Tata Motors, the Skoda source said. The firms are also looking at potential joint development of components, he added. A Tata Motors spokesperson said the companies were  evaluating the potential cooperation,  without elaborating.      If it can succeed, a budget car for India would tap into a lucrative part of one of the world's fastest growing auto markets, and would be a big boost in VW's battle for global industry leadership with Japan's Toyota (7203.T). But it's early days, and the project won't be easy. Rival General Motors (GM) (GM.N) has decided to stop selling cars altogether in India due to cut-throat competition. There are also question marks over whether VW has entirely cast off its old centralizing habits.  For example, when the company's factory in Tennessee had problems ramping up production of its new U.S. SUV, the Atlas, Wolfsburg vetoed a contract extension for the head of the plant, according to one VW source. VW last month said only that he was returning to Germany after completing his assignment. The biggest brake on Mueller's decentralization drive may come from VW's home state of Lower Saxony and powerful labor unions, which together dominate the supervisory board that decides on plant closures, asset sales and executive posts.  Home to six VW plants with over 100,000 workers, Lower Saxony has the most to lose from a dispersal of power to VW's regions. Its leadership supports Mueller's reforms, but with reservations, saying employees should be involved and changes should not be implemented in a top-down way.   A culture change can only succeed together with all participants,  Lower Saxony prime minister Stephan Weil told Reuters.  An assortment of Volkswagen Passat vehicles sit for sale at a Volkswagen dealership in San Diego, California, September 21, 2015.Mike BlakeTaking Responsibility Many of Mueller's reforms are aimed at engaging and empowering staff, while breaking down barriers with executives.  Some changes have been symbolic, such as selling VW's corporate Airbus jet or opening up the executive dining room at Wolfsburg to factory workers; others, more fundamental, such as empowering senior engineers to control budgets and deadlines, according to company sources. Mueller is also reducing the number of the group's corporate committees by a third, and staff have noticed a difference.  Before the crisis, top management was aloof,  said an employee who has worked in administration at Wolfsburg for 15 years.  Now there is a refreshing sense of normality.   To encourage innovation and risk-taking, VW is considering raising the pay of its 20,000 managers worldwide, said group human resources boss Karlheinz Blessing. Blessing himself is trying to lead the change in culture by shunning the executive car park and riding a bicycle on factory grounds.  We encourage people to take responsibility,  he said in an interview.  But that will take time. First there needs to be confidence that you won't be raked over the coals if you make a wrong decision.   Slideshow (4 Images)There are hopes this more hands-off management style will also improve company performance. Elmar-Marius Licharz, one of four new model-line chiefs at the VW brand, said designers and engineers working on the VW Golf 2019 model were about two months ahead of target, suggesting the pace of product development had picked up with fewer top managers intervening in the process.   Involving the CEO in development of each model creates a lot of time limitations,  he said.   It's all about collaboration and self-reliance now.  Herculean Task For all Mueller's reforms within VW, however, corporate governance experts say there has not been enough progress in opening up the company to outside scrutiny. The executive hired for a newly created management board position for integrity and legal affairs quit in January after only a year in the job, with VW citing unspecified differences with management. A new appointment has been made.  That compares with GM which, after its own scandal over safety defects, appointed a vice president for vehicle safety and publicly stated that if there were any obstacles to solving a safety issue the executive  has the authority to clear them.  A labor union source said VW's compliance efforts were in their infancy, with only about 65 compliance officers and 25 or so integrity experts at a new unit responsible for the group's 620,000 workers. VW declined to comment.   That compares with the several hundred of compliance officers and experts that German industrial group Siemens has employed since a 2006 corruption scandal. For Christian Strenger, a supervisory board member at Deutsche Bank's (DBKGn.DE) retail asset management arm DWS, VW's reforms will fall short until it improves the oversight of top executives and brings in new leaders to replace the likes of Mueller and Chairman Hans-Dieter Poetsch, another VW veteran.  He has filed a lawsuit against VW's entire management and supervisory boards to try to reverse the 2016 appointments of Poetsch and three other supervisory board members. He wants them replaced with independent directors.   Without substantial changes, neither customers, investors, the public nor the media will be convinced by this cultural change,  Strenger, a former corporate governance adviser to the German government, told Reuters. There is no sign that VW's leadership, backed by the group's Porsche-Piech founding families which own a controlling stake in the business, is ready to comply.   We consider this lawsuit to be completely unfounded,  a VW spokesman in Wolfsburg said. So the battle over reform at VW looks set to rage on.   The cultural overhaul is a Herculean task and will take 10-15 years to materialise,  predicted Stefan Bratzel, head of the Center of Automotive Management think-tank near Cologne.

Fitch has also affirmed CdT's bonds and notes at long-term 'A-'. Fitch rates CdT, using a top-down rating approach under its 'Rating of Public-Sector Entities - Outside the United States' criteria, to reflect the credit links between CdT and its sponsor, the Autonomous Province of Trento (PAT; A-/Stable), such as those underlined by the presence of a statutory guarantee issued by the sponsor on CdT's financial liabilities. KEY RATING DRIVERS The ratings of CdT reflect PAT's continued solid financial support, its strong integration with and extensive control by the sponsor, and its key role in the province's financial strategy. CdT's ratings are equalised with those of PAT by virtue of the guarantee it provides for CdT's debt under provincial law 13/1973 art. 8bis. The Stable Outlook reflects Fitch's expectation of no major rating changes in the foreseeable future. Legal Status (Mid-Range): CdT is 100%-owned by PAT for which it is the financial arm, with the statutory mission and mandate to manage and provide financial resources for public investments within the regional territory on behalf of PAT, while providing support to the local economy, financial policies and provincial development. Despite its joint-stock company status, the not-for-profit mission of CdT increases its dependence on the province. Integration (Stronger): CdT is tightly integrated within the provincial wider public sector and PAT retains a close grip on its strategies and operations. Although CDT's finances are not directly consolidated in the sponsor's budget, CDT must comply with provincial indebtedness limits. In addition, CdT is fully dependent on PAT for its funding needs, which means the latter also has extensive and explicit control over its finances. If necessary, CdT can access credit lines from PAT's treasury bank or receive advanced subsidies. Control (Stronger): PAT directly and solely appointed CdT's Board of Directors, approves the company's financial statements and retains control over the company's major strategic decisions. The statutory provincial guarantee (unconditional, irrevocable and on first demand) on 100% of CdT's outstanding debt is the key determinant of PAT's tight control. According to PAT, CdT may eventually issue additional liabilities to accommodate a potential enlargement of its responsibilities, albeit under the close scrutiny of the province. Strategic Importance (Stronger): CdT disburses funds, including capital subsidies, on behalf of the province, to finance municipalities' and public sector entities' (PSEs) investments, as well as performing treasury service. In Fitch's view, the unique role of CdT as the province's financial arm supports its strategic importance for PAT. The guarantee also extends to CdT's future issuance, provided it is within the limits stated by law for public sector borrowing to which PAT must comply. Ninety-five per cent of CdT's liabilities, or EUR2.2 billion, comes from loans and bonds that CdT issues on behalf of the province and whose repayment is backed by provincial transfers, matching debt amortisation and assisted by provincial guarantees. Supported by solid profitability (return on equity of 6.5% in 2016), CdT distributes reserves to PAT (EUR6 million in 2016; on average EUR4 million per year in 2012-2015), offsetting the higher-than-market average spread on interest paid by the province. CdT has negligible market and concentration risks, excellent asset quality with no impaired loans, and maintains strong access to capital markets. Fitch believes CdT would most likely receive extraordinary support from its sponsor in case of need. Its EUR1.4 billion total outstanding debt as of end-2016 - of which one third are bullet bonds backed by cash provisions - represents only one-third of the provincial budget. Fitch expects CdT's net interest margin to remain below 1% of assets over the medium term (0.6% in 2016), with assets declining to around EUR2 billion and interest margin at around EUR14 million (on average EUR15 million in 2014-2016). We forecast net income will be around EUR5 million in 2017-2019 due to CdT's not-for-profit mission (on average EUR6.5 million in 2013-2016). CdT's solvency is underpinned by a stable revenue structure based on PAT's support. CdT traditionally maintains adequate liquidity with cash averaging at about one third of the its financial debt. CdT's access to credit lines from the province's treasury bank and to future subsidies from PAT provide an additional safety net. RATING SENSITIVITIES As CdT's ratings mirror PAT's IDRs a change in the sponsor's ratings would therefore be reflected on those of CdT. A dilution of support from or weaker integration with PAT, resulting from an increase in non-guaranteed financial debt towards one-third of total debt or a change in statute or the legislative framework weakening CdT's links with the province, may lead to a negative rating action.

When the ANC picks Zuma's successor in December, unionist-turned-business tycoon Ramaphosa is expected to face off against veteran politician Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, former African Union chairwoman and Zuma's ex-wife. Ramaphosa is viewed as more investor friendly and has pledged to fight the corruption that has plagued Zuma's tenure. Dlamini-Zuma appeals to ANC grassroots and has the support of Zuma's well-established patronage network. Zuma's business friends, the Guptas, have been accused by ANC politicians and the opposition of using their close relationship with Zuma and his allies to influence the awarding of government contracts worth hundreds of millions of dollars. The Guptas, Indian-born South Africans, and Zuma deny wrongdoing. Local media last month, citing leaked emails from Gupta-controlled companies, said millions of dollars of state-funds were diverted in 2013 to pay for a four-day Gupta family wedding at the luxury Sun City resort outside Johannesburg. Zuma has said that a flurry of media reports in the last six weeks based on a massive leak of emails from Gupta companies are speculation. In his strongest statement to date against the Guptas, Ramaphosa disagreed with his boss.  We know that we as tax payers of this country paid for a lavish wedding that took place in Sun City,  Ramaphosa told members of the South African Communist Party, which has called for Zuma to step down over a string of corruption scandals.  I Will Not Remain Quiet   We also know that these are resources that rightly belong to the people of South Africa. Should we remain quiet when all this happens? I am one of those who will not remain quiet.  Ramaphosa called for a judicial inquiry into what is known locally as  state-capture  because of allegations that many parts of the government are involved. A Gupta family spokesman and a Zuma's spokesman did not respond to request for comment. London-based public relations firm Bell Pottinger apologized last week and said it had suspended a partner after it was accused of stirring racial tensions in a PR campaign it ran while working for the Guptas.   Bell Pottinger ended their relationship with Gupta-owned Oakbay in April.   In its advice to Zuma's son Duduzane, director of a Gupta company, Bell Pottinger stressed the need to highlight the  existence of economic apartheid . This preceded Zuma and Dlamini-Zuma's supporters publicly saying that  state capture  investigations should focus on white-owned businesses and attacked their opponents in the ANC as being agents of  white monopoly capital . Ramaphosa hit back on Wednesday.  It is a matter of grave concern that a public relations company from outside of our country was able to so effectively poison the political discourse in our country,  he said.

Wells, which was the No. 2 U.S. provider of auto loans less than a year ago, has already cut quarterly originations by nearly 30 percent over the nine months leading into March 31, according to a May 11 company presentation. It has also begun consolidating the collections operation in a move that people familiar with the business say could eliminate hundreds of jobs, after a new head of auto finance took the reins in April. Wells Fargo joins other lenders in reducing exposure to the rapidly cooling U.S. auto market. Bankers, auto industry executives, analysts and regulators have been warning since 2014 that the auto loan market could overheat after being fueled for years by low interest rates and easy financing terms. Chasing growth, some lenders, including Wells Fargo, began to embrace borrowers with shaky credit. In late 2015, however, auto default rates began creeping above other types of consumer debt, according to data compiled by Cox Automotive, prompting some lenders to tighten standards and edge away from the market. Wells Fargo began curtailing its auto exposure beginning last year. It cut the share of subprime loans in the auto portfolio to 8 over percent in the first quarter from over 11 percent a year earlier, according to a company presentation.  Analysts expect to see higher delinquency and default rates when Wells Fargo reports results on Friday.  The general view, which they've been pretty clear about, is that loan growth will be negative for next two to three quarters,  said Brian Foran, an analyst at Autonomous Research. He expects the auto pullback to shave roughly one percentage point off Wells Fargo's net interest income growth over time. The bank's executives have acknowledged that tightening of standards comes at a price.  Wells Fargo is willing to give up volume and share in order to protect its balance sheet from credit risk,  Franklin Codel, the bank's head of consumer lending, told the bank's investor day in May. At the same event, Chief Executive Officer Tim Sloan singled out auto loans as the business with the biggest potential for a  negative credit event.  A Wells Fargo spokeswoman declined to comment for this story beyond what executives have already said about auto lending. As Wells Fargo's auto loan originations have dropped, it has slipped to No. 7 from No. 2 among top U.S. auto lenders, according to Experian Automotive. The bank also began a revamp of its auto business early this year as part of a broad overhaul following a sales scandal that has roiled the third-largest U.S. bank by assets. In April, Laura Schupbach took over management of the auto business, months after her predecessor, Dawn Martin Harp, announced plans to leave. Schupbach is a 22-year Wells Fargo veteran who most recently ran its insurance business after various roles in finance and expenses, according to her corporate biography. Weeks later, the bank began the process of moving collections staff from 57 locations across the country to three central hubs in Raleigh, North Carolina, Irving, Texas and Chandler, Arizona, according to an internal memo viewed by Reuters. People with knowledge of the business say hundreds of positions will likely be eliminated. A bank spokeswoman declined to say how many jobs might be lost, and would not authorize an interview with Schupbach. Martin Harp could not be reached. Less Independence The auto lending shake-up, some details of which were first reported by Auto Finance News, is the latest indication that Wells Fargo's top management is seeking greater control over businesses that traditionally operated with much independence. In interviews, three people who have worked inside the auto lending operation raised questions about what impact the abandoning of the  run it like you own it  philosophy will have in the long term. In recent years auto lending delivered nearly twice as much in revenue per dollar of expenses as the overall bank, according to people familiar with the numbers. They attributed the performance to tight cost controls and the operational independence that was once a source of pride for  Wells Fargo. But that business model has come under scrutiny after revelations that thousands of branch employees created as many as 2.1 million accounts to hit aggressive sales targets. Following an internal investigation, Wells Fargo's directors released a report in April recommending tighter and more centralized risk management. Since then, Wells has begun moving 5,200 risk employees from business units to one  corporate risk  division. Although the changes could make businesses less nimble, tighter controls were inevitable, said Marty Mosby, analyst at Vining Sparks.  It was hard for them to give up that last piece of who they really were,  he said.  That's what made them more profitable than the other bank.

The European Union's sanctions, painfully negotiated by all 28 EU governments in 2014 and so far renewed every six months, are the bloc's toughest response to Russia's annexation of Crimea and its support for separatists in eastern Ukraine.  But it is up to each EU government to enforce them and they do not apply to companies' Russian subsidiaries, making any possible wrongdoing very hard to prove. Reuters reported on July 5 that two electricity turbines made by Siemens were shipped to the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea, which is subject to EU sanctions that ban EU firms from supplying energy technology there. Siemens said the turbines were transferred to Crimea without its knowledge and against its will.  Implementation and enforcement of EU restrictive measures rests with the member states,  a spokesman for the European Commission said in response to the Siemens case.  The Commission is in touch with the German competent authorities on this particular case,  the spokesman said, referring to Siemens. Still, economic sanctions on Russia, including those on Crimea, have deterred many EU firms from doing business there. EU exports to Russia fell by 40 percent between 2013 and 2016 to 72 billion euros ($82.09 billion), according to the EU's statistics office Eurostat. Direct investment by the European Union's 28 countries into Russia fell 18 percent to 162 billion euros between 2013 and 2015, the latest data available.  The reputational damage of a potential sanctions breach can be enormous,  said Maya Lester, a London-based barrister and author of a European sanctions website.  One practical effect of imposing sanctions can be about sending a message, as well as the restrictions themselves, and compliance is a big issue too.   Overall, the European Union has imposed sanctions banning most EU business with Crimea, has frozen the assets and prohibited travel for Russians linked to the Ukraine crisis and has limited EU investment in Russia's defense and energy sectors. Financing to Russian banks is severely restricted. Unlike the United States, which has robust economic and trade sanctions enforcement through its Office of Foreign Assets Control at the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the European Union has no single such agency. While the EU's institutions in Brussels are instrumental in drawing up the legal language for the punitive regime and drumming up diplomatic support for them, the few dozen experts who help design them do not have the resources to enforce them.  Theatrical rhetoric is not matched by enforcement,  said Tom Keatinge, director of financial crime studies at RUSI think-tank in London.  They have become symbolic,  he said, saying not enough was done to update sanctions to avoid both EU and Russian companies circumventing them. FILE PHOTO: A general view shows a power plant under construction in Sevastopol, Crimea, July 5, 2017.Anton Zverev /File PhotoA Sept. 2016 investigation by Reuters showed that at least two European retailers, Auchan and Metro, were active on the Crimean market through Russian subsidiaries, shipping there from Russia via a ferry and port that are subject to EU sanctions. Furthermore, France last year granted Russian Agriculture Minister Alexander Tkachev a visa even though he has been banned from entering the EU since 2014 because of Crimea. No Database In April, Britain moved to a U.S.-style enforcement policy to allow civil fines of at least 1 million pounds ($1.28 million) on breaches of financial sanctions. FILE PHOTO: Saftey helmets are piled up for media representatives at the Siemens AG gas turbine factory hall in Berlin, Germany, November 8, 2012.Tobias Schwarz/File PhotoHowever, Britain has not so far prosecuted any company for any potential breach of sanctions, Lester said. It was not immediately clear if other EU countries have brought criminal proceedings because no public database exists of sanctions breaches. Many EU countries rely on different agencies, from the central bank to the export licensing authority, to enforce measures. Refusal of licenses can be challenged in court, while customs offices and the public prosecutor are responsible for violations of export controls. EU officials have designed sanctions to be as specific as possible to avoid hurting the wider population, making loopholes easier to find. EU companies are expected to adhere to what EU officials call  the spirit  of the sanctions regime but it does not apply directly to their subsidiaries incorporated in Russia.   If the sanctions are too wide ranging, they may be too disruptive to the EU, or contribute to a financial crisis,  said Erica Moret, chair of the Geneva International Sanctions Network at the Graduate Institute Geneva.  The human costs of blanket sanctions have been too great in the past.  EU governments also want the measures to be able to be lifted quickly in case of a rapprochement with Russia. Defence, energy and financial sanctions could be removed if all sides implement the Minsk peace deal involving the withdrawal of troops and weaponry from eastern Ukraine. Russian denies any direct involvement in the conflict that has killed more than 10,000 people since April 2014.

The court move means Metro can proceed with plans to list shares in its wholesale and hypermarkets food business on Thursday, while shares in the consumer electronics business - renamed Ceconomy - will trade independently for the first time. Metro, a sprawling conglomerate, has spent several years restructuring and selling non-core businesses such as its Kaufhof department stores, to focus on its cash-and-carry business and Media-Saturn electronics chain. Fierce competition from Amazon (AMZN.O) is seen as likely to trigger more mergers in the consumer electronics sector after French retailer Fnac (FNAC.PA) bought Darty last year.  Ceconomy will drive the transformation and consolidation of consumer electronics in Europe in a dynamic way,  Chief Executive Pieter Haas told reporters on a conference call. Haas said he expected the pace of consolidation to increase in the coming years due to the need for  massive  investment in areas such as digital price tags, loyalty schemes and big data processing as ecommerce shakes up retailing. In May Ceconomy reported a loss due to heavy investment. FILE PHOTO: A worker arranges vegetables inside a newly opened wholesale store of Metro Cash & Carry India, at Sarkhej on the outskirts of Ahmedabad, India June 13, 2017.Amit Dave/File PhotoCeconomy is Europe's biggest consumer electronics group, ahead of Britain's Dixons Carphone (DC.L), running more than 1,000 stores in 15 European countries, with sales of 22 billion euros ($25 billion) in the 2015/16 financial year. Metro's cash-and carry business that serves independent traders, hotels and restaurants is already an active acquirer, buying Pro a Pro from Belgian retail and wholesale group Colruyt last year and Singapore-based Classic Fine Foods in 2015. Metro's wholesale business has 751 stores in 25 countries. Along with Real hypermarkets in Germany, Metro's food unit had 2015-16 sales of 37 billion euros. Metro hopes the split will trigger a revaluation of the stock as Metro has traded at a discount to other pure wholesale retailers such as Sysco (SYY.N) and Britain's Booker (BOK.L). Shares in Metro, which have sagged on uncertainty about the court proceedings, were up 1.5 percent to 29.64 euros by 1142 GMT.  Most of Metro's shareholders already approved the plan to split in February, but some, including Erich Kellerhals, the founder of Media-Saturn, launched a legal challenge.  Kellerhals has been at odds with Metro over its management of Media-Saturn for years. Kellerhals' Convergenta investment firm said it would actively defend its rights in the new structure but Ceconomy's Haas said the split should limit his influence in the future. Bernstein analyst Bruno Monteyne expects the current share price of around 29 euros to be split into about 18.50 euros for the wholesale and food group and 10.50 for Ceconomy at the opening auction on Thursday.

The motor, pet and commercial insurance firm, which has a valuation of around 450 million pounds ($578.66 million), hired Swiss bank Mirabaud a few months ago to advise it on boosting its capital position, Gary Humphreys told Reuters by phone.  We think that with Brexit and Solvency II, there are some opportunities for acquisition going forward.  Humphreys said the firm would make a decision in the next few weeks about its strategy, which could include raising capital of at least 100 million pounds. Markerstudy recently received an offer for the company from a private equity firm but was not pursuing that deal, Humphreys said. He declined to name the bidder.  It's a bit like the old football analogy that no player is for sale unless someone offers more than expected,  he said.  We are not looking to exit the business at all but you can never say never, if someone makes a fantastic offer.  Humphreys, who together with chief executive Kevin Spencer owns the company, said new European Union solvency capital rules, known as Solvency II, were making it expensive for some smaller general insurers, likely leading to consolidation in the sector. The firm, which has registered operations in Britain and Gibraltar and whose customers are in Britain, last week said it was considering moving its Malta-domiciled insurer, St Julians, to Gibraltar as a result of Brexit. Markerstudy has pulled out of European markets in Ireland and Norway, Humphreys said, which previously accounted for around 5 percent of its business. $1 = 0.7777 pounds Reporting by Carolyn Cohn.

The fund will try to connect startup companies with its corporate investors, which include big automotive suppliers BorgWarner Inc and Autoliv Inc, and two unidentified automakers, Autotech founders Quin Garcia and Alexei Andreev told Reuters ahead of Wednesday's announcement of the fund. The fund already has investments in ride service company Lyft; Outdoorsy, which enables users to share recreational vehicles; and Work Truck Solutions, which designs software to help owners of commercial truck fleets track their vehicles.  Older transportation companies are looking for ideas on how to make money from vehicles after the initial sale, such as through sharing services. They also are interested in startups that could help them use data acquired from vehicles to sell insurance or locate and pay for parking, Garcia and Andreev said. The new Autotech Ventures fund comes as vehicle manufacturers and suppliers are scouring the technology sector for talent and ideas but are wary of overpaying.  General Motors Co's estimated $1 billion acquisition of self-driving vehicle company Cruise Automation and Uber Technologies Inc's [UBER.UL] purchase of self-driving truck startup Otto have accelerated this trend. In the self-driving vehicle arena, the Autotech Ventures fund will focus on companies developing specific technology, “rather than a jack of all trades,” Garcia said.   Autotech Ventures has invested in Deepscale, a startup developing technology that processes the information a car gets from sensors about the surrounding environment but is not trying to build an entire operating system for an autonomous vehicle.

A judicial source said first indications suggested that Jean-Michel Lambert, 65, who was found dead at his home near Le Mans by emergency services late on Tuesday, had committed suicide.  There was no trace of violence...(and) no trace of a break-in,  said the Le Mans prosecutor in a statement. Lambert had been the first magistrate in charge of the investigation into the 1984 killing of four-year-old Gregory Villemin, whose body was discovered, bound hand and foot, in a river. The murder, which remains unsolved, was followed by a revenge killing, and other highly-publicized twists and turns where relatives were one after the other accused of being guilty amid a series of anonymous letters. The case was opened and closed again several times over the decades. Then, in June this year, it was back in the headlines as a couple in their 70s and a 48-year old woman, all relatives of the child, were placed under investigation.  Judge Lambert, who was 32 at the time, was often criticized for the way he handled the case between 1984 and 1987.         On Tuesday, a French news channel published what it said were notes from another judge who investigated the case and had severely criticized Lambert's work.     A month after Gregory's death, Bernard Laroche, a cousin of the child's father, was charged based on evidence provided by his sister-in-law, Muriel Bolle - the youngest of the trio put under investigation last month. Laroche was freed after evidence against him was thrown out by prosecutors. But convinced that he was the murderer, Gregory's father Jean-Marie Villemin shot and killed him in 1985, and served four years in jail for the act. Gregory's mother, Christine Villemin, also fell under suspicion because witnesses said they had seen her at the post office on the day that one of the mysterious letters was sent. She was later cleared.

Talks with a Japanese government-backed group chosen by Toshiba as a preferred bidder for its chip business have stalled due to what sources say are proposals by SK Hynix that its financing be done via convertible bonds. In the first public acknowledgement that it wants a stake in the world's No. 2 NAND producer, SK Hynix chief executive Park Sung-wook told reporters that it is continuing to negotiate the purchase and will not drop its equity plan. The preferred bidder group also includes the state-backed fund Innovation Network Corp of Japan, the Development Bank of Japan and U.S. private equity firm Bain Capital. But the stand-off resulted on Tuesday in Toshiba saying it was again talking with suitors Western Digital Corp (WDC.O) and Foxconn (2317.TW) due to the lack of progress. The embattled conglomerate does not want its South Korean rival to have an equity or management influence in the chip unit - a stance it has taken to satisfy a government that wants the technology to remain under domestic control. Some Japanese officials had hoped SK Hynix may back down from its demand for a stake, sources have said.  Hit by massive cost overruns at its now bankrupt U.S. nuclear unit Westinghouse, Toshiba needs billions of dollars in fresh loans to tide it over before it can complete the $18 billion sale of the memory chip unit. It sold its medical equipment business to Canon Inc for $6 billion last year and its Landis+Gyr smart meters unit aims to raise up to $2.5 billion, but that will not be enough to plug the hole in its balance sheet. And although Japanese banking sources said on Tuesday that Toshiba has regained access to a $6 billion credit line, lenders have also imposed tough conditions.  Toshiba has told creditors it will need 1 trillion yen in fresh loans during the current financial year through March, banking sources have said previously. Sources said Toshiba's banks, which include Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp (8316.T) and Mizuho Bank (8411.T), allowed it to withdraw 100 billion yen ($880 million) in loans late last month but must seek permission every week to extend the loan, despite a previously-agreed commitment line of 680 billion yen. Another obstacle in the chip unit auction has been Toshiba's strained ties with Western Digital, which bought SanDisk, Toshiba's memory chip business partner, in May last year.  Last month, Western Digital sought a U.S. court injunction to prevent Toshiba selling the chip unit without its consent. A hearing on that request is scheduled for Friday. The banking sources said they were worried the conflict could end up scuppering the sale as well as the chip business' long-term prospects. One said he hoped that Toshiba and Western Digital would work to resolve their conflict.

(NYSE: DLR). The notes will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Digital Realty Trust, Inc. and Digital Realty Trust, L.P. The Rating Outlook is Stable. A full list of rating actions follows at the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS On June 9, 2017, Digital Realty Trust announced an agreement to merge with DuPont Fabros Technology, Inc. and form an entity with a combined enterprise value of approximately $34 billion. The merger will be effected on a stock-for-stock basis. DLR's ratings and Outlook reflect the strengthening of the tenant profile post-merger and increased product offering and scale of the company's portfolio upon completion of the transaction. Fitch expects the company's credit metrics to remain relatively unchanged post-transaction. As the second largest data center REIT, Digital Realty exhibits credit strengths including a global platform, granular tenant base, good access to multiple sources of capital, adequate liquidity, and a deep management bench. The rating takes into account the niche asset class in which the company operates, resulting in a less liquid investment market and leveragability than other commercial property asset classes. Complementary Transaction: The DuPont merger strengthens DLR's existing portfolio in key markets such as Northern Virginia, Chicago and Silicon Valley. In addition, the company will obtain increased exposure to cloud service providers, potentially enabling DLR to further enhance top-line growth via its global presence and broad product offerings. Key Metrics Remain Appropriate for Rating: Fitch estimates pro forma leverage at 4.9x for the TTM ended March 31, 2017. Fitch expects that leverage (when excluding preferred stock) will remain between 5.0x and 5.5x over the next 12 to 24 months, consistent with the company's leverage historically. Fitch expects that leverage including 50% of preferred stock will be between 5.5x to 6.0x over our projection period. Fitch expects DLR's fixed-charge coverage will be in the high 3.0x's area over the next 12 to 24 months, driven by same-store NOI growth, cash flow from the lease-up of developments, and increased cash flow from joint ventures, offset by a reduction of EBITDA from the sale of non-core assets. Pro forma fixed-charge coverage is strong for the rating at 3.9x, compared with 3.5x and 3.2x for the years 2016 and 2015, respectively. Global Platform and Good Tenant Diversity: Pro forma for the merger, Digital Realty's product offering will consist of turn-key flex, powered base building, cloud-based computing, colocation and interconnection across its 157 operating properties spanning over 30 markets, 12 countries, and four continents. The company also benefits from a granular tenant roster which, pro forma for the merger, includes IBM (IDR 'A+'/Negative Outlook) at 6.2% of annual base rent, an undisclosed Fortune 50 software company at 6.0%, Facebook at 5.9%, CenturyLink, Inc. (IDR 'BB+' /Rating Watch Negative) at 4.6%, Rackspace (IDR 'BB-'/Positive Outlook) at 2.7% and Equinix, Inc. (IDR 'BB'/Stable Outlook) at 2.7%. Good Access to Most Capital Sources: Since 2006, the company has issued $4.8 billion of common equity, $1.9 billion of preferred equity, $3.5 billion of dollar-denominated unsecured bonds, GBP700 million of sterling-denominated unsecured bonds and EUR725 million of euro-denominated bonds. The company's sterling and euro-denominated bonds function as a natural hedge given the company's exposure to the United Kingdom and other European countries. Less Contingent Liquidity for Data Centers: Digital Realty's financial metrics are intrinsically strong for the 'BBB' rating category; however, the ratings are constrained by data center properties being a less-than-mature asset class and the less liquid market for trading and financing these assets. The company has shown consistent access to most capital sources, but the availability of mortgage capital for data centers is not as deep compared with other commercial real estate property types, limiting the sources of contingent liquidity. Despite the significant barriers to entry and favorable medium-term IT trends, data centers are specialized properties and technological obsolescence over the long term is possible. Compared with other real estate assets, data centers have a less liquid investment market with fewer potential buyers, making these assets potentially more difficult to divest or borrow against in a depressed market. These market characteristics can reduce the ability of data centers to serve as a reliable and consistent source of contingent liquidity. Digital Realty is committed to an unsecured funding profile. Pro forma for the merger, unencumbered assets (unencumbered NOI divided by a stressed capitalization rate of 10%) covered net unsecured debt by 2.2x as of March 31, 2017, which is adequate for the 'BBB' rating. Deep Management Bench; Conservative Mind-Set: The company's management team has strong real estate expertise and technical acumen as well as strong knowledge of the sector, including cloud services solutions. The company consistently funds large-scale acquisitions on a leverage-neutral basis, pre-funding the equity portion at transaction announcement to minimize capital markets execution risk. Preferred Stock Notching: The two-notch differential between DLR's IDR and preferred stock rating is consistent with Fitch's criteria for corporate entities with an IDR of 'BBB'. Based on Fitch research  Treatment and Notching of Hybrids in Nonfinancial Corporate and REIT Credit Analysis , available at 'www.fitchratings.com', these preferred securities are deeply subordinated and have loss absorption elements that would likely result in poor recoveries in the event of a corporate default. Stable Outlook: The Stable Outlook reflects Fitch's expectation that metrics will remain appropriate for the rating through the forecast period. DERIVATION SUMMARY Digital Realty Trust is the second largest data center REIT by enterprise value. The company has strong market position, providing services to some of the largest global cloud and information technology customers, from which the company generates consistent cash flow via long-term leases and relatively minimal tenant turnover. Fitch expects the company will maintain leverage (excluding preferred stock) at an absolute level that is low for the rating, at approximately 5.0x. This low leverage is offset by less availability of mortgage financing for its asset class relative to other REITs with similar leverage and cash flow profiles that have higher ratings. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: --Low single-digit same-store NOI growth through the forecast period; --DuPont Fabros transaction closes in the second half of 2017 on terms substantially similar to those announced by the company; --The company funds additional growth and development on a leverage-neutral basis, resulting in leverage (excluding preferred stock) ranging between 5.0x to 5.5x, and 5.5x to 6.0x when including 50% of preferred stock as debt. RATING SENSITIVITIES Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action --Increased mortgage lending activity in the data center sector, demonstrating contingent liquidity for the asset class; --Leverage, excluding preferred stock, sustaining below 4.5x (TTM ended March 31, 2017 leverage was 5.1x; 4.9x pro forma for the DuPont merger); --Fixed charge coverage sustaining above 3x (Quarter ended March 31, 2017 coverage was 3.8x, TTM coverage pro forma for the DuPont merger was 3.9x). Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action --Leverage, excluding preferred stock, sustaining above 6x; --Fixed charge coverage sustaining below 2.5x; --Base case liquidity coverage sustaining below 1x (pro forma liquidity coverage was 1.9x); --Sustained declines in rental rates and same-property NOI.. LIQUIDITY Liquidity coverage (defined as pro forma liquidity sources divided by uses) is adequate at 1.9x for the period from April 1, 2017 to Dec. 31, 2018. Sources of liquidity include unrestricted cash less working capital requirements, availability under DLR's global unsecured revolving credit facility, and projected retained cash flows from operating activities after dividends and distributions. Pro forma uses of liquidity include debt maturities as well as projected recurring capital expenditures and cost-to-complete active development. DLR's standalone adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) payout ratio fell from the mid 80% range to the high 60% range beginning in 2016, enabling the company to retain more than $270 million during the year and putting it on pace to retain more than $280 million in 2017. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch currently rates Digital as follows: Digital Realty Trust, Inc. --Long-Term IDR 'BBB'; --Preferred stock 'BB+'.

The manner of Fitch’s factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors.

Spain has hundreds of mass graves from the war and from ensuing decades of dictatorship under General Francisco Franco. Very few have been dug up due to a lack of funding and Spain's  pact of forgetting  on its return to democracy in the 1970s. The brains from some of the bodies in the La Pedraja grave were preserved by very specific environmental conditions after heavy rains seeped into bullet holes in their skulls. This  saponification  process turned them into a soap-like substance.  A preserved heart has also been unearthed, an unprecedented finding, says forensic scientist Fernando Serrulla who worked on the dig and has published a study with details of the discovery.  Fernando Serrulla, a forensic anthropologist of the Aranzadi Science Society, shows one of the 45 brains saponified of those killed by forces of the dictator Francisco Franco which were found in 2010 in a mass grave around the area known as La Pedraja, at a laboratory in Verin, Spain, June 9, 2017. Picture taken June 9, 2017.Juan Medina Naturally preserved brains are very rare,  Serrulla said.  There are only around 100 documented cases in the world.  The brains are being kept in a laboratory in Galicia, northwestern Spain, where Serrulla works. Shrivelled, brown and with the ridges still showing, they form the largest collection of naturally preserved human brains in the world, he says. Slideshow (14 Images)None of the preserved organs and only 16 of the 104 bodies dug up from the grave have been identified. Rafael Martinez, the president of a socialist association killed by Franco's supporters in 1936, was recently identified as one of the bodies in La Pedraja.  If only those brains could tell of what happened there,  his grandson, Miguel Angel Martinez, said.

Inga 3 is part of a $50 billion-$80 billion project to expand hydroelectric dams along the Congo River, but the project has repeatedly been delayed by red tape and disagreements between Congo and its partners on the project. A consortium led by China Three Gorges Corporation and another consortium that includes Spain's ACS (Actividades de Construccion y Servicios SA) have been vying to develop the project. They will now submit a joint bid on the expanded project in September, the project's director said on Wednesday. Bruno Kapandji, director of the Agency for the Development and Promotion of the Grand Inga Project, said the plant would be built to produce between 10,000 and 12,000 megawatts of power, more than double the originally planned capacity of 4,800 MW. Increased capacity would help meet rising power demand and bring down costs, he said, although he did not say how much the expanded project would cost. The original $14 billion project struggled to attract financing and the World Bank last year suspended funding after the president's office took control of the project, raising transparency concerns at the bank. The plant is projected to provide power for South Africa as well as mines and other consumers in Congo. However, campaign group International Rivers said last month that Inga 3 would incur massive debts and that the plant would deliver little to no electricity to consumers inside Congo because of transmission losses and because production would not meet its target.

Mighty Corp, which has been charged with avoiding 37.88 billion pesos in tax payments, has offered to pay the Philippines government 25 billion pesos.  It will fund the tax settlement with a 45 billion peso sale of its assets to JT International Philippines, a local subsidiary of Japan Tobacco, the Philippines' Department of Finance said in a statement, quoting a letter from Mighty President Oscar Barrientos. A Japan Tobacco spokeswoman in Tokyo confirmed the company was in talks with Mighty to buy its manufacturing and distribution assets, but declined further comment.  Officials at Mighty, the second-largest tobacco company in the Philippines, were not immediately available for comment. Japan Tobacco, the world's third-biggest tobacco company, said in May it was looking for mergers and acquisitions in emerging markets such as southeast Asia, Africa and Latin America, as it diversifies away from its home market. It is also widely seen as a potential suitor for Britain's Imperial Brands (IMB.L), and Jefferies analysts said on Wednesday the purchase of Mighty did nothing to change that, given the small size of Mighty.   This further highlights their appetite for a deal and perhaps the urgency with which JT knows it needs to act to address structural pressures and close the gap on peers,  Jefferies said.   The potential acquisition by Japan Tobacco, which sells the Winston, Mild Seven and Camel brands in the Philippines, would help it to challenge the dominance of PMFTC Inc, a joint venture of the Philippines unit of Philip Morris International (PM.N) and unlisted Fortune Tobacco Corp, in the southeast Asian country's cigarette market.

The deal includes an initial consideration of $947 million and additional payments of up to $285 million between 2018-2025, subject to gas price and production, Shell said on Wednesday. The Anglo-Dutch company is on track to sell assets of about $30 billion by 2018 to cut debt following its $54 billion acquisition of BG Group. Shell has also been working to mitigate climate change risks that have upset some investors. The development of the Corrib gas field, discovered in 1996, has faced protests since 2005 by residents concerned that the laying of a high-pressure pipeline to bring gas onshore could pollute their water supply. CPPIB, Canada's biggest public pension fund, and Vermilion Energy Inc will become the new operator of the gas field off the north-west coast of Ireland. For CPPIB, the deal is another step in its pursuit to diversify beyond domestic markets. The fund's most recent deal in the energy sector was to invest up to $1 billion to acquire U.S. oil and gas assets.     The transaction will result in an impairment charge of around $350 million in Q2 2017, Shell said. The transaction, which is subject to partner and regulatory approval, is expected to complete in the second quarter of 2018, the company said. Norway's Statoil, which owns a 36.5 per cent stake in the Corrib gas field venture, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Mighty Corp, which has been charged with avoiding 37.88 billion pesos in tax payments, has offered to pay the Philippines government 25 billion pesos.  It will fund the tax settlement with a 45 billion peso sale of its assets to JT International Philippines, a local subsidiary of Japan Tobacco, the Philippines' Department of Finance said in a statement, quoting a letter from Mighty President Oscar Barrientos. A Japan Tobacco spokeswoman in Tokyo confirmed the company was in talks with Mighty to buy its manufacturing and distribution assets, but declined further comment.  Officials at Mighty, the second-largest tobacco company in the Philippines, were not immediately available for comment. Japan Tobacco, the world's third-biggest tobacco company, said in May it was looking for mergers and acquisitions in emerging markets such as southeast Asia, Africa and Latin America, as it diversifies away from its home market. It is also widely seen as a potential suitor for Britain's Imperial Brands (IMB.L), and Jefferies analysts said on Wednesday the purchase of Mighty did nothing to change that, given the small size of Mighty.   This further highlights their appetite for a deal and perhaps the urgency with which JT knows it needs to act to address structural pressures and close the gap on peers,  Jefferies said.   The potential acquisition by Japan Tobacco, which sells the Winston, Mild Seven and Camel brands in the Philippines, would help it to challenge the dominance of PMFTC Inc, a joint venture of the Philippines unit of Philip Morris International (PM.N) and unlisted Fortune Tobacco Corp, in the southeast Asian country's cigarette market.

The deal includes an initial consideration of $947 million and additional payments of up to $285 million between 2018-2025, subject to gas price and production, Shell said on Wednesday. The Anglo-Dutch company is on track to sell assets of about $30 billion by 2018 to cut debt following its $54 billion acquisition of BG Group. Shell has also been working to mitigate climate change risks that have upset some investors. The development of the Corrib gas field, discovered in 1996, has faced protests since 2005 by residents concerned that the laying of a high-pressure pipeline to bring gas onshore could pollute their water supply. CPPIB, Canada's biggest public pension fund, and Vermilion Energy Inc will become the new operator of the gas field off the north-west coast of Ireland. For CPPIB, the deal is another step in its pursuit to diversify beyond domestic markets. The fund's most recent deal in the energy sector was to invest up to $1 billion to acquire U.S. oil and gas assets.     The transaction will result in an impairment charge of around $350 million in Q2 2017, Shell said. The transaction, which is subject to partner and regulatory approval, is expected to complete in the second quarter of 2018, the company said. Norway's Statoil, which owns a 36.5 per cent stake in the Corrib gas field venture, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Spain has hundreds of mass graves from the war and from ensuing decades of dictatorship under General Francisco Franco. Very few have been dug up due to a lack of funding and Spain's  pact of forgetting  on its return to democracy in the 1970s. The brains from some of the bodies in the La Pedraja grave were preserved by very specific environmental conditions after heavy rains seeped into bullet holes in their skulls. This  saponification  process turned them into a soap-like substance.  A preserved heart has also been unearthed, an unprecedented finding, says forensic scientist Fernando Serrulla who worked on the dig and has published a study with details of the discovery.  Fernando Serrulla, a forensic anthropologist of the Aranzadi Science Society, shows one of the 45 brains saponified of those killed by forces of the dictator Francisco Franco which were found in 2010 in a mass grave around the area known as La Pedraja, at a laboratory in Verin, Spain, June 9, 2017.

The court move means Metro can proceed with plans to list shares in its wholesale and hypermarkets food business on Thursday, while shares in the consumer electronics business - renamed Ceconomy - will trade independently for the first time. Metro, a sprawling conglomerate, has spent several years restructuring and selling non-core businesses such as its Kaufhof department stores, to focus on its cash-and-carry business and Media-Saturn electronics chain. Fierce competition from Amazon (AMZN.O) is seen as likely to trigger more mergers in the consumer electronics sector after French retailer Fnac (FNAC.PA) bought Darty last year.  Ceconomy will drive the transformation and consolidation of consumer electronics in Europe in a dynamic way,  Chief Executive Pieter Haas told reporters on a conference call. Haas said he expected the pace of consolidation to increase in the coming years due to the need for  massive  investment in areas such as digital price tags, loyalty schemes and big data processing as ecommerce shakes up retailing. In May Ceconomy reported a loss due to heavy investment. FILE PHOTO: A worker arranges vegetables inside a newly opened wholesale store of Metro Cash & Carry India, at Sarkhej on the outskirts of Ahmedabad, India June 13, 2017.Amit Dave/File PhotoCeconomy is Europe's biggest consumer electronics group, ahead of Britain's Dixons Carphone (DC.L), running more than 1,000 stores in 15 European countries, with sales of 22 billion euros ($25 billion) in the 2015/16 financial year. Metro's cash-and carry business that serves independent traders, hotels and restaurants is already an active acquirer, buying Pro a Pro from Belgian retail and wholesale group Colruyt last year and Singapore-based Classic Fine Foods in 2015. Metro's wholesale business has 751 stores in 25 countries. Along with Real hypermarkets in Germany, Metro's food unit had 2015-16 sales of 37 billion euros. Metro hopes the split will trigger a revaluation of the stock as Metro has traded at a discount to other pure wholesale retailers such as Sysco (SYY.N) and Britain's Booker (BOK.L). Shares in Metro, which have sagged on uncertainty about the court proceedings, were up 1.5 percent to 29.64 euros by 1142 GMT.  Most of Metro's shareholders already approved the plan to split in February, but some, including Erich Kellerhals, the founder of Media-Saturn, launched a legal challenge.  Kellerhals has been at odds with Metro over its management of Media-Saturn for years. Kellerhals' Convergenta investment firm said it would actively defend its rights in the new structure but Ceconomy's Haas said the split should limit his influence in the future. Bernstein analyst Bruno Monteyne expects the current share price of around 29 euros to be split into about 18.50 euros for the wholesale and food group and 10.50 for Ceconomy at the opening auction on Thursday.

ANZ has been pursuing a sale of its 24 percent stake in its Malaysian affiliate AMMB Holdings (AmBank) (AMMB.KL) since early last year as part of a strategy to divest minority stakes in Asia and as AmBank was dragged into a wide-ranging corruption scandal at state fund 1MDB. In June, RHB Bank (RHBC.KL) and AmBank said they were starting merger talks, in Malaysia's biggest ever banking deal. As part of the all-share deal, valued at about $9 billion, RHB is looking to acquire AmBank and the two banks are in exclusive talks until the end of August. ANZ's stake is expected to be roughly 10 percent in the merged entity. Sources said ANZ is in talks to sell that stake to Malaysian retirement fund KWAP, which already owns small stakes in both RHB and AmBank. Both firms have  agreed in principle  to the deal at a price equivalent to one time book value of AmBank, said one of the sources.  KWAP has always had an aspiration to hold a significant investment in a financial institution. KWAP had considered purchasing part of ANZ's stake two years ago but was not agreeable to the pricing,  said the source. Last week, Malaysia's Star newspaper quoted KWAP CEO Wan Kamaruzaman Wan Ahmad as saying the fund was keen on buying ANZ's stake after the proposed RHB and AmBank merger. KWAP and AmBank declined to comment.  We will decline to comment on market speculation,  an ANZ spokesman said.  ANZ's stake is also drawing interest from another Malaysian institutional investor, said the source. The sources declined to be identified as the discussions were private. RHB has indicated to analysts that it would pay AmBank shareholders a one-time multiple of the latter's book value.  1mdb Shadow ANZ wanted to exit the stake partly after AmBank was dragged into a political scandal linked to state fund 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB) and Prime Minister Najib Razak, sources have previously said. In 2015, AmBank was slapped with a 53.7 million ringgit fine by Malaysian regulators for breaching financial regulations. Najib has been buffeted by allegations of graft, in particular by revelations of the transfer of hundreds of millions of dollars into his AmBank account in 2013. The Prime Minister has denied any wrongdoing. If the RHB-AmBank merger wins the approval of shareholders, the stakes of other key shareholders will also decline in the merged entity. Abu Dhabi's Aabar Investments, with a 17.8 percent stake in RHB, would hold 10.3 percent, according to a note by Maybank Research. The Abu Dhabi firm, which has been linked to the 1MDB scandal, merged into Mubadala last year. A separate source close to Mubadala said the firm wants to eventually sell Aabar's stake in RHB, but will wait until it gets a  fair  price. Mubadala declined to comment.

The presiding judge, who had just sentenced Polonsky to five years in prison in one breath, ordered his release in the next, saying too much time had elapsed since his crime for the sentence to have legal force. Polonsky, 44, staged antics during his career ranging from a hunger strike to eating part of his tie on live TV. However, they failed to endear him with Russians left behind by the boom during President Vladimir Putin's first two terms in office and who are now struggling following a sharp economic slowdown. Vedomosti, a business daily, quoted him as saying in 2008 that anyone who did not have a billion dollars could  fuck off . Polonsky - a former occupant of the Forbes rich list with a fortune of $1.2 billion - disputes the accuracy of the quote. Nevertheless, it went viral as the global financial crisis was about hit Russia and many ordinary people remember it with bitterness to this day. The conviction, despite his unexpected release, appears to mark the end of an era in Russian business when displays of fabulous riches were common and tycoons were self-made through wheeling and dealing. That has been replaced by a more sober atmosphere where the Kremlin frowns on the flaunting of wealth and only Kremlin-connected tycoons make the biggest fortunes. Polonsky has spent the last five years fighting the fraud allegations and more than two years in pre-trial detention in Moscow. He says his fate is a cautionary tale about the risks of doing business in Russia today. Making money is closely tied up with fickle and often corrupt political connections and business partners routinely betray one another, stealing and cheating their way to huge wealth, he alleged in court.  It's civil war,  he told the judge in his final address.  How can we do business if we are destroying one another? The situation is close to catastrophic with the Russian economy.  Polonsky's legal problems began in 2012 when state prosecutors accused his firm of stealing more than 5.7 billion roubles (now $94 million) of prepayments for flats in an unfinished Moscow complex it was building. Polonsky, who at 1.93 metres (6 feet 4 inches) towers over most people, denied wrongdoing. He said the funds were taken in good faith, that many of the apartments had been delivered, but that the global crisis had made it impossible to hand over others on time. He alleged that business partners, keen to steal his firm, had helped to organise charges against him. They had encouraged scores of buyers who did not get their homes on time to cooperate with investigators, even though he was working with them to try to find a solution, Polonsky said. The judge sided with state prosecutors, however, and only the statute of limitations saved Polonsky from more prison time. Forbes List to Jail Polonsky, originally from St Petersburg, found success as a young man, thriving in the anarchic 1990s that followed the fall of the Soviet Union. He and a friend started small, buying up unfinished apartments, doing them up, and selling them for a higher price. They soon graduated to entire buildings and built one of the city's early business centres. Polonsky opened an office in Moscow in 2000 but he and his friend later split the business. Polonsky took sole control of the Moscow firm, which he called Mirax Group, and his friend the St Petersburg operation. Mirax flourished, embarking on projects in the United States, Britain, Turkey and Ukraine among others. Back at home, it started building the Federation Tower, billed as the Russian capital's first skyscraper and the tallest building in Europe. In 2008 when Polonsky was 35 years old, Forbes magazine estimated his wealth at $1.2 billion. Mirax was hit hard by the crisis of that same year, when demand for the swish apartments and town houses it specialised in building slumped, leaving the firm overstretched and mired in debt. It struggled to raise fresh capital. In October that year, Polonsky pledged to eat his tie if prices for elite apartments did not rise by a quarter in a year and a half. They didn't and Polonsky stuck to his promise. Mirax staggered on even as creditors called in its debts, securing a loan of almost $400 million from a state lender. Polonsky liquidated the brand and renamed the firm. The crisis affected a residential complex Polonsky had taken on at the request of the Moscow authorities after the company he was working with on the project terminated the contract, citing Mirax's funding problems. Polonsky, in protest, declared the hunger strike and took up round-the-clock residence in a tent on the construction site. In June 2013, the Interior Ministry charged him with embezzlement, saying he had taken 5.78 billion roubles in downpayments from people wanting to buy flats at the site that they never received. The funds had been illegally diverted to other Mirax entities, investigators said. Polonsky, who at the time was in Cambodia where he also had real estate interests, denied wrongdoing. He spent time in a Cambodian prison after being accused of briefly kidnapping six Cambodian sailors in a New Year's Eve celebration gone wrong. In May 2015, he was deported to Moscow. Sporting long hair and a beard outside the court on Wednesday, Polonsky told reporters he had  something to say  about the verdict but would be devoting his first seven days of freedom to his wife. When asked what his wider plans were, he replied:  To turn the world upside down.

In what may be one of her last appearances on Capitol Hill, Yellen depicted an economy that, while growing slowly, continued to add jobs, benefited from steady household consumption and a recent jump in business investment, and was now being supported as well by stronger economic conditions abroad. The Fed  continues to expect that the evolution of the economy will warrant gradual increases in the federal funds rate over time,  Yellen said, while reductions in the Fed's more than $4 trillion in securities are likely to begin  this year.  Yellen will present her latest economic summary to the House Committee on Financial Services at 10 a.m. (1400 GMT), after which committee members will question her. Her appearances before the House panel have sometimes involved sharp exchanges with lawmakers who think the Fed's influence over the economy has grown too large, and who want policymakers to be guided more closely by a mathematical rule for setting interest rates. In a report released last week the Fed compared its current policy to that prescribed by a variety of such rules - pointing out that the choice of a rule itself involved judgments that would lead to vastly different outcomes. Yellen referred House lawmakers specifically to that section of the report in her testimony. Yellen's appearance comes as the Trump administration mulls whether to replace her when her term ends in February. By her testimony today, the economy is currently on an even keel, near or beyond full employment. Interest rates are rising, and  would not have to rise all that much further  to reach what the Fed considers a neutral rate that neither encourages nor discourages spending and investment, Yellen said. The reduction in the balance sheet, which will begin slowly as the Fed reinvests only a portion of the holdings that mature each month, will mark the final exit from crisis-related policies. Though a recent dip in inflation has been of concern among Fed officials who want to see surer progress toward the central bank's 2 percent inflation goal, Yellen ascribed it to  a few unusual reductions in certain categories of prices  that would eventually drop out of the calculation. Otherwise, she said, the economy appeared to be in a virtuous loop of hiring, spending and investment that  should increase resource utilization somewhat further, thereby fostering a stronger pace of wage and price increases.

The Teranet-National Bank Composite House Price Index, which measures changes for repeat sales of single-family homes, showed prices rose 2.6 percent from May. It was the largest increase for the month of June in the 19-year history of the index, and took it to a record for the seventeenth month in a row. Prices rose in 10 out of the 11 markets covered by the index, with Toronto up 3.7 percent and nearby Hamilton rising 4.1 percent. Hamilton has seen prices surge as homebuyers have been priced out of Toronto, Canada's largest city. The housing data comes ahead of a Bank of Canada interest rate decision in which the central bank is expected to raise rates for the first time in nearly seven years. Some have blamed years of cheap borrowing costs for fueling Canada's long housing boom. In April, the Ontario government put a number of measures in place to cool the housing market in Toronto and the surrounding region, including a foreign buyers tax. While other data has shown sales have tumbled since then, the Teranet report pointed to ongoing price acceleration. Toronto prices were up 29.3 percent from a year ago, while Hamilton was up 25.6 percent. In the once-hot market of Vancouver, where provincial authorities imposed their own foreign buyers tax last year, prices rose 2.5 percent on the month to hit a record after cooling through late 2016.

ANZ has been pursuing a sale of its 24 percent stake in its Malaysian affiliate AMMB Holdings (AmBank) (AMMB.KL) since early last year as part of a strategy to divest minority stakes in Asia and as AmBank was dragged into a wide-ranging corruption scandal at state fund 1MDB. In June, RHB Bank (RHBC.KL) and AmBank said they were starting merger talks, in Malaysia's biggest ever banking deal. As part of the all-share deal, valued at about $9 billion, RHB is looking to acquire AmBank and the two banks are in exclusive talks until the end of August. ANZ's stake is expected to be roughly 10 percent in the merged entity. Sources said ANZ is in talks to sell that stake to Malaysian retirement fund KWAP, which already owns small stakes in both RHB and AmBank. Both firms have  agreed in principle  to the deal at a price equivalent to one time book value of AmBank, said one of the sources.  KWAP has always had an aspiration to hold a significant investment in a financial institution. KWAP had considered purchasing part of ANZ's stake two years ago but was not agreeable to the pricing,  said the source. Last week, Malaysia's Star newspaper quoted KWAP CEO Wan Kamaruzaman Wan Ahmad as saying the fund was keen on buying ANZ's stake after the proposed RHB and AmBank merger. KWAP and AmBank declined to comment.  We will decline to comment on market speculation,  an ANZ spokesman said.  ANZ's stake is also drawing interest from another Malaysian institutional investor, said the source. The sources declined to be identified as the discussions were private. RHB has indicated to analysts that it would pay AmBank shareholders a one-time multiple of the latter's book value.  1mdb Shadow ANZ wanted to exit the stake partly after AmBank was dragged into a political scandal linked to state fund 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB) and Prime Minister Najib Razak, sources have previously said. In 2015, AmBank was slapped with a 53.7 million ringgit fine by Malaysian regulators for breaching financial regulations. Najib has been buffeted by allegations of graft, in particular by revelations of the transfer of hundreds of millions of dollars into his AmBank account in 2013. The Prime Minister has denied any wrongdoing. If the RHB-AmBank merger wins the approval of shareholders, the stakes of other key shareholders will also decline in the merged entity. Abu Dhabi's Aabar Investments, with a 17.8 percent stake in RHB, would hold 10.3 percent, according to a note by Maybank Research. The Abu Dhabi firm, which has been linked to the 1MDB scandal, merged into Mubadala last year. A separate source close to Mubadala said the firm wants to eventually sell Aabar's stake in RHB, but will wait until it gets a  fair  price. Mubadala declined to comment.

The Fed Chair is expected to tell the House Financial Services Committee at 1000 ET that the central bank remains on a hawkish course of steadily rising rates.

This will likely provide further evidence on the strength of the economy and give the Fed impetus to raise interest rates. The Fed's next policy meeting is on July 25-26.

One of the biggest icebergs on record has broken away from Antarctica, scientists said, creating an extra hazard for ships around the continent as it breaks up. Big icebergs break off Antarctica naturally, meaning scientists are not linking the rift to manmade climate change. The ice, however, is a part of the Antarctic peninsula that has warmed fast in recent decades.

Super Sports Media Inc, a Cayman Islands-based company, is the current holder of broadcasting rights to England's top soccer league in China, which it owns up until the end of the 2018/2019 season. DDMC said in a filing to the Shanghai stock exchange that it would be making the acquisition via its Hong Kong unit. Trading in DDMC's shares, which has been halted since mid-February, will remain suspended. The latest deal signals a consolidation of power over soccer rights in the world's second largest economy as Chinese companies spend heavily to capture sports viewers. Super Sports has been streaming the English game in China for the past seven years and has been ambitiously pushing for a pay-per-view model. However, last year, it was outbid by PPTV, a unit of retail giant Suning Commerce Group Co, in a $700 million deal for three-year EPL content rights from 2019 onwards. DDMC, which has business in marketing and agent services and other sports investments, set up a joint venture last month with Suning to manage foreign soccer rights in China. The consolidation means Suning, the owner of Italian club Inter Milan, and DDMC will have most European soccer rights under their control, including Spain's La Liga, German Bundesliga and the Premier League.  The deal means we will have an integrated platform for content managing and operation, and strengthen our bargaining power against foreign content providers,  said a source close to the deal. Prices for high-quality sports content have shot up in China with increasing competition between local rivals including Suning, Super Sports, LeSports, Sina Sports and others.

The spot rupee ended at 153.65/75 per dollar, compared with Tuesday's close of 153.70/75.  There was exporter dollar sales and we saw some inflows. If not for the central bank dollar buying, the rupee would have appreciated further,  said a currency dealer, asking not to be named. The central bank's Deputy Governor Nandalal Weerasinghe said the bank had completely stopped defending the currency unlike in the past.  Since February, we have been only buying dollars. We are not selling at all. We do not see any pressure on the rupee. It is market-driven demand and supply,  he told Reuters in an interview.  If we do not intervene and buy, probably it will appreciate. We are buying and preventing certain appreciation.  Dealers said the market has priced in further depreciation due to the central bank's no-intervention policy. The spot rupee resumed trading on June 19 for the first time since May 5, when the central bank fixed its reference rate at 152.50. Dealers said they expected seasonal demand for dollars to pick up from August. The rupee has been under pressure since early this year after the central bank stopped providing support for the currency at a time when the island nation faces a balance of payments crunch. The rupee has fallen around 2.6 percent so far this year.

Yemi Osinbajo's brief and unannounced trip has revived speculation about Buhari's health and whether he will be able to stand for re-election in 2019. The details of his illness have not been made public.  He is in very high spirits, he is recuperating very quickly and we had a very long conversation. We spoke for well over an hour. His humour is all there. He is doing well,  said Osinbajo, who is acting president.  We discussed wide-ranging issues. I can't go into specifics,  he said in his first public comments after returning to Abuja on Wednesday morning. Osinbajo then chaired a weekly cabinet meeting. When Buhari, 74, left Abuja for London on May 7, his second trip abroad for health reasons, he handed over power to Osinbajo, who according to the constitution would assume the presidency should Buhari be unable to continue. Osinbajo is already being talked about in the capital as a potential nominee for the 2019 presidential election in Nigeria, sub-Saharan Africa's largest economy and energy producer. Questioning the Narrative A thin-looking Buhari was last seen in Nigeria on state television in early May, just hours before he flew to Britain, welcoming a group of 82 girls released by the Islamist militant group Boko Haram. Buhari's first trip to London for health reasons was in January and lasted nearly two months. The Nigerian public's view of Buhari's situation has turned sceptical. As the trickle of information about the president's health, which used to include photographs of meetings in London, dries up, some are questioning the official narrative.  I don't know, unless they show it to us on television or through anything, that both of them (Buhari and Osinbajo) are meeting,  said Adeleke Ogunlana, a businessman in Lagos.  I don't believe they met at all.  With the economy now in its second year of recession, the first in a quarter of a century, others asked whether a sickly person should be at the helm.  We want a healthy, vibrant president who is sound mentally and physically to be able to handle the problems facing the country,  said Emeka Iloabuchi, a Lagos-based marketer.  The president as far as I am concerned should leave the office, should resign honorably so that the people of Nigeria can have a man that is healthy.  Avoiding Political Infighting  Nigerian officials have sought to avoid a scenario seen in 2010 when political infighting broke out during the lengthy illness of then-President Umaru Yar'Adua. Osinbajo has been given full powers to act during Buhari's absences, in contrast to predecessor Goodluck Jonathan who only took over after Yar'Adua's death in 2010 ended the power vacuum. Investors have welcomed Osinbajo, a Christian lawyer from the commercial capital Lagos in southwest Nigeria who is seen as more business-friendly than Buhari.  But the long-term risk is that the Muslim north, where Buhari hails from, might not accept Osinbajo as a permanent solution if the president became incapacitated at some point. Traditionally in Nigeria, the leadership rotates between north and south to ensure a balance in a country evenly split between Muslims and Christians. Jonathan, a Christian from the south, upset many northerners by refusing to give way to a northern candidate in 2010. Many northerners had felt there should have been another northern presidential term after Yar'Adua's premature death.

The Colombo stock index ended 0.03 percent weaker at 6,748.15, slipping from its highest close since Jan. 7, 2016, in the previous session.  There was some trade by institutional investors. Other than that, the day was quiet,  said Prashan Fernando, CEO at Acuity Stockbrokers. However, Fernando said the market could see a rising trend if yields in fixed-asset income falls, as the central bank expected on Wednesday. The monetary authority expects a further fall in T-bill yields due to less pressure from government borrowing and a proposed new auction system, the bank's deputy governor, Nandalal Weerasinghe, said. The bourse saw net foreign outflows for the first time in 13 sessions, with net selling of 27.9 million rupees ($181,700) worth of shares. But foreign investors have been net buyers of 22.8 billion rupees worth of equities this year. The day's turnover was 557.9 million rupees, off this year's daily average of 909.9 million rupees. Analysts said new foreign investors have been buying Sri Lankan shares since the Pakistani bourse was upgraded to emerging market status from frontier market. In May, index provider MSCI announced changes to its indexes as a result of its semi-annual market reclassification, including reclassifying Pakistan, and the addition of 57 securities and removal of 28 securities from its All-Country World Index. Brokers said domestic investors had been waiting for some clarity on proposed inland revenue legislation, which some companies expect would result in higher costs of production. The IMF, which has long urged Sri Lanka to boost tax revenue through modernisation and simplification of its fiscal system, has urged the government to submit to parliament a new Inland Revenue Act. Shares of conglomerate John Keells Holdings Plc closed 0.6 percent lower, gains were led by Bukit Darah Plc which rose 4.3 percent.

Tesco, Britain's biggest retailer, and Booker announced the cash and shares deal in January and the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) formally started a phase 1 review in May. Last month, Tesco and Booker asked the CMA to move swiftly to a more in-depth phase 2 examination. The CMA said on Wednesday it believed that in over 350 local areas where there was currently an overlap between Tesco shops and Booker-supplied independent grocery retailers, or so-called  symbol  stores, shoppers could face worse terms when buying products. It said there were concerns that if the deal was cleared there was potential for Booker to reduce the wholesale services or terms it offers the stores it currently supplies, in order to drive customers to their local Tesco. The figure of 350 areas under scrutiny was lower than initially speculated by analysts and media when the deal was announced. Analysts at HSBC noted that previous reviews by the CMA, such as of Booker's purchase of Irish retail and wholesaler Musgraves in 2015, suggested that barriers to switching by symbol groups to alternative wholesalers were low.     This offers some hope that once an in-depth review is carried out, remedies (required by the CMA) may be even lower than the initial 350,  they said. HSBC has a  buy  stance on Tesco. Booker supplies services to over 5,000 symbol stores, operating under the Premier, Londis, Budgens and Family Shopper brands. It also supplies restaurants such as Wagamama and Carluccio's and operates the Makro cash and carry business. FILE PHOTO: A branded sign is displayed outside of a Booker Wholesale store in London, Britain January 27, 2017.Neil Hall/File PhotoTesco runs more than 3,000 stores across Britain. The CMA said other concerns were raised and considered in the initial probe, but it had not found it necessary to conclude on all of these given the referral. The regulator will now assess whether the deal could reduce competition by conducting further research and analysis as well as seeking views and evidence from all those potentially affected by the deal. The CMA's in-depth phase 2 investigation lasts 24 weeks. Its final report will be published before Christmas, following an earlier provisional findings report. The transaction will be cleared if the phase 2 inquiry does not find it will reduce competition. If competition is seen to be affected, the CMA can either seek remedies or block the deal. Tesco sees the deal as a new source of growth given Booker's role as a major distributor to the catering industry. Some Tesco shareholders have criticized the transaction, saying it was overpaying and a distraction from its turnaround plan. Tesco and Booker said they were pleased the CMA had accepted their fast track request.  This merger has always been about growth, and we remain convinced that it will bring benefits for consumers, independent retailers, caterers, small businesses, suppliers and colleagues,  a Tesco spokesman said.  We look forward to continuing our constructive engagement with the CMA,  added a Booker spokeswoman. Shares in Tesco were down 0.2 percent at 171 pence at 1137 GMT, while Booker shares were down 0.5 percent at 189 pence.

Trump Jr. released a series of emails on Tuesday that revealed he had eagerly agreed to meet a woman he was told was a Russian government lawyer who might have damaging information about Democratic rival Hillary Clinton as part of Moscow's official support for his father. Trump Jr., in a Fox News television interview Tuesday, said:  In retrospect, I probably would have done things a little differently.   The president, after initially releasing a statement calling his son  high-quality,  on Wednesday praised the TV appearance and again condemned news coverage and investigations into his campaign's alleged links to Russia.  He was open, transparent and innocent. This is the greatest Witch Hunt in political history. Sad!  Trump wrote on Twitter. Christopher Wray, Trump's nominee to lead the Federal Bureau of Investigation, told a U.S. Senate confirmation hearing on Wednesday he did not consider special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian meddling to be a  witch hunt.  The emails offered the most concrete evidence to date that Trump campaign officials embraced an offer of Russian help to win the election, a subject that has cast a cloud over Trump's presidency and spurred multiple investigations. Related CoverageU.S. Senate Judiciary chairman to call ex-Trump aide Manafort to testifyRussia's Lavrov: show me at least one fact Moscow meddled in U.S. electionKremlin 'has nothing to do' with Russian lawyer who contacted Trump's teamThe emails do not appear to provide evidence of illegal activity, but legal experts say Trump Jr. could run into trouble if investigators find he aided a criminal action, such as hacking into Democratic computer networks, or violated campaign-finance laws by accepting gifts from foreign entities.   U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded Moscow sought to help Trump win the election, in part by releasing private emails from Democratic Party officials.            The Justice Department and Congress are both investigating alleged Russian interference in the election and possible collusion with Trump's campaign.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Wednesday it was preposterous that Trump's eldest son was under attack for meeting the Russian lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya.  I learned with surprise that a Russian lawyer, a woman, is being blamed and Trump's son is being blamed for meeting. For me, this is wild,  Lavrov told a news conference in Brussels.          Slideshow (3 Images)'Functioning Perfectly' The allegations that Russia tried to help Trump win the election has cast a cloud over his presidency. White House aides say the president keenly watches cable TV news, which he often mentions in his tweets. Trump denied that on Wednesday, saying the White House was focused on getting healthcare and tax reforms through Congress.  The W.H. is functioning perfectly, focused on HealthCare, Tax Cuts/Reform & many other things. I have very little time for watching T.V.,  Trump wrote on Twitter.  One of the president's personal attorneys, Jay Sekulow, in a series of TV interviews on Wednesday said Trump Jr.'s meeting with Veselnitskaya was not a violation of the law and that the president was unaware of the meeting and the emails until recently.   There's no illegality,  he told NBC's  Today  program.      Trump Jr. said that Paul Manafort, Trump's campaign manager at the time, and son-in-law Jared Kushner, now a top White House adviser, also attended the meeting with Veselnitskaya, who has denied having Kremlin ties.

Britain's biggest telecoms group was rocked in January when it cut profit forecasts due to an Italian accounting scandal and a slowdown in key government work, wiping 8 billion pounds ($10.3 billion) off its value in just one day. The disclosure weakened BT as it fought a bitter standoff with the British regulator over its management of the country's core broadband network, giving the impression that it was fighting battles on multiple fronts and not properly in control of its sprawling business. Investors used the company's annual meeting on Wednesday to demand answers as to why the company had not seen the crisis coming. At 289 pence, BT shares remain below the 303 pence level to which they fell on the day of the January profit warning.  (I am) deeply disappointed in regard to the share price,  Chairman Mike Rake told shareholders.  Unfortunately we have had a perfect storm as regards the share price,  he said, citing issues such as the impact from last year's Brexit vote, the accounting scandal and the company's pension deficit. Since January BT has struck a deal with regulator Ofcom to legally separate its national network from the rest of the business - avoiding the threat of a full breakup - and has announced plans to tackle the source of the Italian scandal by cutting 4,000 jobs and replacing its Global Services boss. Rake, who will be replaced later this year by Jan du Plessis, chairman of the world's second-biggest miner Rio Tinto , said he had sought to avoid inflicting further harm when asked why more people had not taken responsibility for the scandal.  You cannot take steps that would further damage the company in a crisis,  said Rake, who will step down after 10 years in the role. The twin shocks to the business, which brought an abrupt halt to BT's gradual recovery since the 2008 downturn, have also forced it to rein in its dividend growth forecasts and cut management pay. Chief Executive Gavin Patterson did not get a bonus after a difficult year, meaning his total pay package fell in 2016/17 to 1.3 million pounds, down by 4 million pounds on the year before. $1 = 0.7762 pounds Reporting by Paul Sandle; writing by Kate Holton; editing by","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bt-agm-idUSL8N1K3388"},

Acquisitions and joint ventures are becoming more difficult for Chinese firms, Hu Zhijian, president of the Chinese Academy of Science and Technology for Development (CASTED), told reporters in Beijing on Wednesday.  It is not wise for the U.S. to close its doors in industries that are declining in profit ... the United States should step forward and develop new technology areas,  said Hu.   U.S. regulators have called for heightened scrutiny of Chinese chip acquisitions leading to a chill in overseas M&A; activity by Chinese chip firms, with a number of high-level deals failing to gain approval. In December the Obama administration blocked China's Fujian Grand Chip Investment Fund (FGC) from completing the acquisition of German semiconductor firm Aixtron (AIXGn.DE) over national security concerns related to Aixtron's U.S. assets. In March China-backed buyout fund Canyon Bridge Capital Partners LLC resubmitted a $1.3 billion bid for U.S. chip firm Lattice Semiconductor Corp (LSCC.O) to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) after the initial review period expired. More than 20 U.S. Congress members signed a letter to the U.S. Treasury in December calling for a block on the Lattice deal, saying it could disrupt the U.S. military supply chain and increase reliance on foreign chipmakers.  The United States should not be afraid of other countries catching up,  Hu said, adding that China is seeking technologies the United States has already developed in the past two decades and Chinese investment could boot profitability in the sector. Washington recently sought to strengthen the role of CFIUS, the inter-agency committee that reviews foreign acquisitions of U.S. companies on national security grounds. U.S. politicians and lawmakers have called for the committee to increase deal scrutiny in areas where China is seeking to build world-leading technology, including artificial intelligence.  China will release a national artificial intelligence plan in the coming months, following a similar roadmap released by the United States, Hu said.

The Czech National Bank (CNB) is the only one in the region to have shifted to a hawkish policy stance, starting in April when it ended its policy of capping the crown at 27 versus the euro to let the currency strengthen.     It has also factored into its economic forecasts interest rate hikes in the third quarter of the year.     Economic growth has picked up to around 3-4 percent in Central European states, but a rise in inflation which began last year lost steam in recent months.     Data released on Wednesday showed a drop in Czech annual inflation to 2.3 percent in June from 2.4 percent in May, the the result of lower fuel inflation.     But a continuing rise in core inflation to 2.6 percent provides the CNB with sufficient argument to lift rates as early as its next meeting on Aug. 3, Capital Economics analyst Liam Carson said in a note.     The crown firmed, approaching its strongest levels since the exit from the cap, attained last week at 26.048. But it was unable to break below the 26.1 line, and at 1113 GMT it traded at 26.114, up 0.1 percent.     Analysts remained split over the rate outlook.     KBC analysts said in a note that the CNB faced a dilemma as headline inflation was above its 2 percent target but below its projection, and may decrease further in the next months.      The case (of) a rate hike in the third quarter, which had been advocated by some Board members and still assumes the central bank projection, is not as clear as it looks,  they said.     The CNB said the inflation figures represented  a slight anti-inflationary risk  to its forecasts.     Gains in most Central European currencies were small as investors awaited more clues about global interest rate trends from Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen's testimony to the U.S. Congress starting on Wednesday.      The dinar, however, extended its recent gains and hit 21-month highs against the euro on the firmer side of the psychological 120 line.     The Serbian central bank, which kept the region's highest benchmark rate on hold at 4 percent on Monday, continued to intervene in the market against the currency despite an uptick  in annual inflation to 3.6 percent.     Selling the dinar, it pushed it back to 120.01.

Bradley,US,LME,NFEX,CLEARING,Hong Kong,Company News,Base Metals,Corporate Events,Economic Events,Financial and Commodity Market Operators (TRBC),Mining,Asia / Pacific,Metals Markets,Market Events,Singapore,Regulatory Corporate News Announcements,Government Borrowing Requirement,Metals and Mining (TRBC),Europe,Mineral Resources (TRBC),United Kingdom,United States","sector":"Homepage","content":"LONDON (Reuters) - The London Metal Exchange is the favorite to clear trades for the new base metals platform NFEx as it would be the most efficient option for those wanting to use both venues, sources familiar with the matter said. The new exchange, which will offer trading in base metals such as copper and aluminum, is aiming to go live by the end of the first quarter of 2018 with contracts that mimic the LME's.  NFEx is talking to the LME, Intercontinental Exchange, SGX and CME Group, sources said.  We are in commercial negotiations with several leading commodity clearing Houses, some of these discussions are further progressed than others,  NFEx's chief operating officer Mark Bradley said. ICE, SGX and CME declined to comment. The LME said:  We welcome new initiatives that encourage more volume to the market. As with any potential business opportunity we would always be willing to discuss possible areas where we believe mutual growth could be achieved.  Before launch, Britain's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) needs to authorize NFEx as a multilateral trading facility (MTF). FCA approval is conditional on NFEx having a capital base of 730,000 euros, which sources say it has, and enough cash to operate for at least two years. It is expected to apply for FCA approval by early August.  Clearing arrangements can be agreed at a later date, but will be key to gaining traction.  Netting margin requirements -- typically a deposit required for a futures or forward contract for individual metals -- for commodity futures is possible to some extent on all exchanges. But metals brokers prefer LME Clear, which could help clear the way for NFEx to use LME settlement prices. It would also mean those seeking to trade on the LME and NFEx would not have to pay into two default funds, which protect clearing members in the event one firm cannot honor its trades. Different Contracts  The market wants (NFEx's) clearing to be done by the LME. The margining and administration would make it easier for brokers that want to use both,  a head of a metals brokerage said.  NFEx wants to capture the business that went OTC (over-the-counter), that the LME lost.  An economic slowdown in China, the world's largest consumer of industrial metals, and a massive 31 percent fee hike at the start of January 2015 saw volumes at the LME drop 4.3 percent in 2015 and 7.7 percent in 2016. The resulting drop in revenues could be partly offset by clearing for NFEx, an idea the LME is open to so long as the new exchange does not try to invade its territory, meaning the contracts would have to be different in some way, sources said. One difference is that NFEx is planning cash-settled contracts, while the LME's are physically deliverable.  Another distinguishing feature could be NFEx using  request-for-quote  as an execution venue, a process which offers all participants the opportunity to quote for a specific trading strategy or contract, a source familiar with the matter said.  If the LME wants to launch its own OTC platform, it won't want to clear someone else's OTC trades,  a trader at a copper  producer said.  But they could go with NFEx, save their money and absorb it at a later date if it works.  One idea in the LME's discussion paper launched in April was an OTC or  permissioned dealer-to-client platform separate  to LMESelect, the exchange's electronic trading system.  ICE is the other name that keeps coming up,  a source at a futures exchange said.  ICE could clear for NFEx and in the agreement include an option to take a stake.  ICE lost a bidding war for LME in 2012. It was beaten to the finish by Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing, which paid $2.2 billion for the world's largest and oldest metals market.

Tesco, Britain's biggest retailer, and Booker announced the cash and shares deal in January and the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) formally started a phase 1 review in May. Last month, Tesco and Booker asked the CMA to move swiftly to a more in-depth phase 2 examination. The CMA said on Wednesday it believed that in over 350 local areas where there was currently an overlap between Tesco shops and Booker-supplied independent grocery retailers, or so-called  symbol  stores, shoppers could face worse terms when buying products. It said there were concerns that if the deal was cleared there was potential for Booker to reduce the wholesale services or terms it offers the stores it currently supplies, in order to drive customers to their local Tesco. The figure of 350 areas under scrutiny was lower than initially speculated by analysts and media when the deal was announced. Analysts at HSBC noted that previous reviews by the CMA, such as of Booker's purchase of Irish retail and wholesaler Musgraves in 2015, suggested that barriers to switching by symbol groups to alternative wholesalers were low.     This offers some hope that once an in-depth review is carried out, remedies (required by the CMA) may be even lower than the initial 350,  they said. HSBC has a  buy  stance on Tesco. Booker supplies services to over 5,000 symbol stores, operating under the Premier, Londis, Budgens and Family Shopper brands. It also supplies restaurants such as Wagamama and Carluccio's and operates the Makro cash and carry business. FILE PHOTO: A branded sign is displayed outside of a Booker Wholesale store in London, Britain January 27, 2017.Neil Hall/File PhotoTesco runs more than 3,000 stores across Britain. The CMA said other concerns were raised and considered in the initial probe, but it had not found it necessary to conclude on all of these given the referral. The regulator will now assess whether the deal could reduce competition by conducting further research and analysis as well as seeking views and evidence from all those potentially affected by the deal. The CMA's in-depth phase 2 investigation lasts 24 weeks. Its final report will be published before Christmas, following an earlier provisional findings report. The transaction will be cleared if the phase 2 inquiry does not find it will reduce competition. If competition is seen to be affected, the CMA can either seek remedies or block the deal. Tesco sees the deal as a new source of growth given Booker's role as a major distributor to the catering industry. Some Tesco shareholders have criticized the transaction, saying it was overpaying and a distraction from its turnaround plan. Tesco and Booker said they were pleased the CMA had accepted their fast track request.  This merger has always been about growth, and we remain convinced that it will bring benefits for consumers, independent retailers, caterers, small businesses, suppliers and colleagues,  a Tesco spokesman said.  We look forward to continuing our constructive engagement with the CMA,  added a Booker spokeswoman. Shares in Tesco were down 0.2 percent at 171 pence at 1137 GMT, while Booker shares were down 0.5 percent at 189 pence.

The cost of natural disasters to some of the world's poorest countries has averaged a total of $29.1 billion a year in the past 15 years, catastrophe modeling firm RMS said. While aid has covered 8 percent of this, insurance has only paid for 3 percent of the average costs of earthquakes, drought or floods in 77 low and low-middle income countries, or $900 million, but could cover up to $6.8 billion if more insurance structures were used, RMS said in the report prepared for Britain's Department for International Development. Britain said at last weekend's G20 meeting it would set up the London Centre for Global Disaster Protection to help developing countries use insurance to cut disaster costs.  FILE PHOTO: Rohingya refugee children smiles while holding an umbrella during heavy rain at the Kutupalang Makeshift Refugee Camp in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh, July 8, 2017.Mohammad Ponir Hossain/File Photo There is clear potential for insurance to both reduce the shortfall in funding for natural disaster losses in low and low-middle income countries, and to relieve pressure on humanitarian aid budgets,  RMS said. This includes using so-called  parametric  structures, where insurance payments are triggered by a predetermined factor, such as an increase in water height, at a specified location. Such models are used in existing insurance facilities such as African Risk Capacity and make payments more effective. On a disaster loss of $30 billion, every dollar paid out through parametric insurance has the same impact as $3.50 of slower-moving aid payments, RMS said.

The two men would appear to have little in common. Trump, 71, is an anti-globalist elected on a pledge to  make America great again  who is unpredictable on foreign policy. Macron, 39, is an ardent European integrationist more than three decades younger who sees himself as an honest broker of international relations. Trump's visit to Paris this week, to celebrate 100 years since U.S. troops entered World War One on the side of France and Britain, follows bruising talks on trade and climate policy that pitted him against leaders from the world's major economies at a G20 summit last weekend. In Paris, Trump will seek common ground on diplomatic and military endeavors. Both he and Macron have a political interest in building rapport, and both have a corporate background that may help underpin their relationship. Trump could use a friend overseas. His preference for a more unilateral, transactional diplomacy has unsettled traditional allies in Europe and left the U.S. president appearing isolated among world leaders.   Sometimes Trump makes decisions we don't like, such as on climate, but we can deal with it in two ways: we can say, 'We are not going to talk to you,' or we can offer you our hand to bring you back into the circle,  government spokesman Christophe Castaner told French news channel LCI.  Macron is symbolically offering Trump his hand.  Political Outsiders Trump and Macron are political outsiders, the American a real estate mogul, his French counterpart a former investment banker. Both love a good deal, demand tangible results rather than lofty ambitions, and have a penchant for showmanship. Like Macron, Trump will be looking for common ground. Speaking to reporters on Air Force One returning from the G20 meeting in the German city of Hamburg, Gary Cohn, director of the White House National Economic Council, said Trump and Macron enjoyed a  great  relationship.  You know, Macron and the president have somewhat different views on how to achieve the end goal, but I think the end goal is the same,  Cohn said. Trump announced in June that the United States would pull out of a landmark international accord reached in Paris in 2015 to fight climate change. In hard-fought negotiations in Germany, Macron tried to soften U.S. language on climate policy.  Cohn played down talk of tensions with Macron over climate policy. He said he expected meetings in Paris on military and security matters as well as  a long bilateral meeting between the two men . U.S. President Donald Trump looks at French President Emmanuel Macron before a family photo.Carlos BarriaHaving reshaped their countries' political landscapes, both now have certain shared objectives, making crushing Islamic State and countering global terrorism a leading priority. It is unclear whether the leaders will address thornier issues such as policy toward Iran, possible American tariffs on steel and Russia sanctions legislation in the U.S. Congress that might derail a 9.5 billion euro ($10.9 billion) gas pipe project in which France's Engie SA (ENGIE.PA) has a stake. The United States and France hold differing views on Iran. On a visit to Saudi Arabia in May, Trump singled out Iran as a key source of funding and support for militant groups. During the U.S. presidential race, he threatened to tear up an international agreement on Iran's nuclear program, branding it  the worst deal ever negotiated . So far Trump has stopped short of killing an accord that has allowed French companies including planemaker Airbus SE(AIR.PA), oil major Total SA (TOTF.PA) and automobile manufacturers Peugeot SA(PEUP.PA) and Renault SA(RENA.PA) to sign initial deals. Slideshow (2 Images)'A Win-Win for Both' Just as Macron flattered Russian President Vladimir Putin with a meeting at the gilded Versailles palace of France's former monarchy, Trump will bask in a Bastille Day ceremony on Thursday laden with pageantry and military pomp, with U.S. soldiers parading down the Champs Elysees. For Macron, France's youngest leader since Napoleon two centuries ago, it is an opportunity to use soft diplomacy to win Trump's confidence and set about influencing U.S. foreign policy at a time European diplomats say Washington lacks direction.  The visit is a win-win for both,  said one French diplomat.  Trump remains unchallenged and gets the grandeur that he enjoys. Macron remains unchallenged and gets a no-fuss picture with the leader of the 'free world' . Macron is concerned about Trump feeling backed into a corner, French diplomats said. Moreover, he senses an opportunity to sway U.S. thinking and elevate the role of France, a nuclear power and permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, in global affairs, in particular on Syria and the Middle East, they added. France is the second-biggest contributor to the U.S.-led coalition in Syria, and French officials have expressed fears that the United States has no clear vision beyond taking the military fight to Islamic State. It is one reason, the diplomats say, that in his first two months as president, Macron has sought warmer ties with the Kremlin, just as Trump is left hamstrung in his relations with Moscow by allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election to help Trump win and possible collusion with Russia by people close to him.  The Russians are pleased to have a grown-up to talk to in Europe,  a second French diplomat said. Daniel Fried, an expert on U.S.-European relations who served under presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama, said Trump had nothing to gain politically at home or abroad by isolating himself.  By reaching out to the French I suspect he hopes to show he can be a viable actor on the world stage.

Gnodde,Valdis Dombrovskis,BRITAIN,EUROPE/COST (PIX,GRAPHIC),Americas,United States","sector":"Homepage","content":"LONDON/BERGAMO, Italy, July 12 (Reuters) - Like many multinational companies, Italian engineering business Brembo relies on London to run its finances. The company, based close to the Alps, makes brakes for Formula One cars and motorbikes and sells them in 70 countries. Hundreds of millions of euros pass through its bank accounts each year – and London is the hub for those flows. As Britain prepares to leave the European Union, the company says it may now have to shift the centre of its banking operations to Frankfurt. If Brexit happens with little provision for London's financial services, banks, funds and insurers in London will lose their ability to sell many of their services to European companies. Such upheavals will hurt not just London, say bankers and businessmen, but Europe as well. Financial firms say such shifts will mean the cost of banking for European companies will have to rise, though it is not clear yet who will pick up the bill – the banks or their clients.  At the end of the day it will not be a problem for Brembo, but for our bank,  said Matteo Tiraboschi, executive vice president of Brembo, in an interview at the company's headquarters in Bergamo.  We expect to have the same service for the same price.  Brembo's main bank, Citigroup, declined to comment. Interviews with scores of senior executives from big British and international banks, lawyers, academics, rating agencies and lobbyists outline some of the dangers for companies and consumers from potentially losing access to London's markets. The EU needs London's money, says Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England. He calls Britain  Europe's investment banker  and says half of all the debt and equity issued by the EU involves financial institutions in Britain. Rewiring businesses will be expensive, though estimates vary widely. Investment banks that set up new European outposts to retain access to the EU's single market may see their EU costs rise by between 8 and 22 percent, according to one study by Boston Consulting Group. A separate study by JP Morgan estimates that eight big U.S. and European banks face a combined bill of $7.5 billion over the next five years if they have to move capital markets operations out of London as a result of Brexit. Such costs would equate to an average 2 percent of the banks' global annual expenses, JP Morgan said. Banks say most of those extra costs will end up being paid by customers.  If the cost of production goes up, ultimately a lot of our costs will get passed on to the client base,  said Richard Gnodde, chief executive of the European arm of Goldman Sachs.  As soon as you start to fragment pools of liquidity or fragment capital bases, it becomes less efficient, the costs can go up.  UK-based financial firms are trying to shift some of their operations to Europe to ensure they can still work for EU clients, but warn such a rearrangement of the region's financial architecture could threaten economic stability not only in Britain but also in Europe because so much European money flows through London. European countries, particularly France and Germany, don't share these concerns, viewing Brexit as an opportunity to steal large swathes of business away from Britain and build up their own financial centres. Britain alone accounts for 5.4 percent of global stock markets by value, according to Reuters data. Valdis Dombrovskis, the EU financial services chief, said the EU will still account for 15 percent of global stock markets by value without Britain, and that measures were being taken to strengthen its capital markets. But he added:  Fragmentation is preventing our financial services sector from realising its full potential.  Industry figures have similar concerns. Jean-Louis Laurens, a former senior Rothschild banker and now ambassador for the French asset management lobby, told Reuters:  If London is broken into pieces then it is not going to be as efficient. Both Europe and Britain are going to lose from this.  Money Machine London is currently home to the world's largest number of banks and hosts the largest commercial insurance market. About six trillion euros ($6.8 trillion), or 37 percent, of Europe's financial assets are managed in the UK capital, almost twice the amount of its nearest rival, Paris. And London dominates Europe's 5.2 trillion euro investment banking industry. London's markets insure French nuclear reactors and Greek ships. German carmakers borrow money for expansion. Dutch pensioners invest their savings. Britain has the largest foreign exchange market and the second largest derivatives market in the world, accounting for just under 40 percent of the world's dealings in those markets, while Paris, London's nearest EU rival, handles under 5 percent, according to the Bank for International Settlements. Each year, euro, yen and dollar trades worth about a combined $869 trillion happen in London - more than in all the euro zone countries combined - according to the City of London Corporation. Barclays Chairman John McFarlane told Reuters that a bad trade deal between Britain and the EU risks harming the international economy, and that some banks may decide to abandon some lines of business altogether because they will be too expensive.  Brexit will put a spotlight on the economic attractiveness of activities you are moving,  he said.  Everybody will say, 'If you move, is it worth it financially?'  Bankers say a number of areas are likely to be affected when Britain leaves the EU. The first is Europe's ability to sell sovereign debt. At present, when a country, say Portugal or Greece, needs to sell debt to keep its hospitals or schools running, it will tap the bond markets, arranged by banks primarily in London. London-based firms are currently responsible for trading about 70 percent of sovereign debt in Europe, according to bankers. But some banks are already withdrawing from arranging the bond sales because it is unprofitable. In the first quarter of the year five banks stopped being primary dealers in various European country bonds, Reuters reported in January. The chief executive of one of Britain's largest banks and one of the largest underwriters of European sovereign debt told Reuters the European Central Bank called him asking him not to abandon selling European debt because of Brexit.  They (EU countries) cannot be shut out from London's capital markets,  he said.  It's suicide.  The ECB declined to comment. A second area that may suffer is the selling of derivatives for companies to buy protection against swings in the U.S. dollar or spikes in the price of oil. Bankers say rivals to London will offer a smaller array of products and at a higher cost because there will be fewer banks offering these services. A third area likely to be affected is the clearing of derivatives denominated in euros, an activity that London dominates. EU policymakers want such clearing, which ensures the safe completion of a trade, to be shifted to the euro zone after Brexit. Financiers say that would bump up trading costs for continental customers that deal in a variety of currencies because they will have to route trades through multiple clearing houses, requiring them to post more collateral to back those trades. The Futures Industry Association, a global derivatives industry body, says forcing a shift in euro clearing would increase the amount of cash needed to back trades by about $80 billion. German clearing house Eurex, which stands to gain from a shift, said the increase would be a far more modest $3 billion to $9 billion. The global head of foreign exchange markets at one of the world's largest banks said if the amount of cash required to back trades went up as much as $80 billion – nearly a doubling of the current amount - then  it's going to stop the market.  While bankers say it is hard to estimate how much extra it will cost a European company to borrow without direct access to London's markets, the Association for Financial Markets in Europe said in a report early this month that European customers are being overly optimistic if they think lenders will pick up the bill. The report said for companies similar in size to Brembo  any increase in the cost of debt funding and derivatives would therefore have a material impact on the business, making it less competitive.  Brembo's Tiraboschi disagreed.  As far as Brembo is concerned, we do not have indications for a growth in financing costs linked to Brexit,  he said. Reality Check Last autumn, the British government set about persuading Europe of the risks the EU faces if London's position as a financial centre is damaged. A research paper by Ernst & Young surveying major corporates, including Volkswagen and Airbus, found that companies across Europe were worried about the cost of funding rising. The paper, which was commissioned by the City of London Corporation, a municipal body that runs the financial district, was sent to policymakers across the EU. The British government predicted that European companies would tell their respective governments they face higher costs and potential disruption, putting pressure on politicians to take this into account during Brexit negotiations. In a speech in late June, British finance minister Philip Hammond said Europe will only hurt its own economy if it undermines London's status as a global finance hub.  Fragmentation of financial services would result in poorer quality, higher priced products for everyone concerned,  he said. But Jeremy Browne, the City of London Corporation's special envoy for Europe, who has visited 26 EU countries over the past year, said many companies and politicians are willing to accept higher prices in return for sticking to EU principles and not giving London any special exemptions.  They are not getting down on one knee begging their governments to be nice to Britain,  Browne said. The UK Treasury declined to comment. With formal divorce talks now triggered, the EU is wasting no time in regrouping to try to replicate Britain's financial services on euro zone soil, egged on by the powerful European Central Bank (ECB). In 2015, the EU launched a  capital markets union  project to improve the way companies can raise funds from stocks, bonds and other securities. That project is now being given more priority, the European Commission said in early June. The ECB says that a  new equilibrium  may be beneficial in the long term to euro zone banks looking to take advantage of business opportunities created by Brexit – while an increase in financing costs is likely to be only  modest  in the near term. Christian Noyer, a former central bank governor of France, is now wooing financial firms to relocate to France. He told Reuters that if European banks had time to adapt  they will do exactly the same job  as London does now.  I don't believe for a minute it will be detrimental,  he said. At least eight European cities are vying for financial firms to set up entities in Europe, hoping to attract their highly-paid employees. The French government has been the most aggressive, dangling the promise of tax breaks and flexible labour laws to complement the French capital's cultural charms. The chief financial officer at one of Europe's biggest banks said he sat through a recent presentation by French officials highlighting the restaurants and nightlife in Paris.  It was all very Moulin Rouge,  he said. A senior German lobbying official, who recently held meetings with the German government, said there is a feeling that Britain is failing to understand that the European project comes first.  British politicians think they are in a position whereby the EU 27 will say, 'OK, there are lots of problems for the EU so we will agree on a trade deal as otherwise the EU will be faced with turmoil as well.' They just don't get it,  he said. Infighting Bankers are sceptical about Europe's efforts to replicate London. They say continental Europe is too leery of Anglo-Saxon free-market capitalism - which many politicians and economists blamed for the 2008 to 2009 global financial crisis. London's dominance as a financial centre has been built up over decades and would be very hard to replicate, especially with any speed, given the global talent pool, the widespread use of the UK legal system and the vast amount of money that is managed through London, say executives. The head of European operations at a large U.S. investment bank said that if Europe ever managed to reform its labour laws, develop its capital markets and attract a global workforce, then it would mark the decline of London as a financial centre. But Europe may miss this opportunity, he said, because of infighting between EU countries and no clear plan for where jobs and assets will end up. Discord between the euro zone's three largest countries – Germany, France and Italy - initially stalled the ECB's efforts to come up with a way to force euro clearing out of London and put it under its watch, three sources told Reuters in May. Europe  will end up with a hodgepodge of financial centres,  the U.S. executive said. This is  a humongous risk,  he said.  If Europe becomes so unattractive, we just won't be as big in Europe as we are today. Europe won't win.  Instead, some bankers predict the big gainer could be New York, 3,500 miles away. They say it is the only place that can replicate London's depth of markets and expertise.

São Paulo-based VMH aims to price the secondary, cross-border listing between September and December, said the people. Proceeds will go entirely to parent company Votorantim SA, which needs cash to invest in other business areas, the people said. After considering both New York and Toronto, VMH picked the Toronto Stock Exchange because of its experience in mining-related IPOs, the people said. If successful, the VHM IPO would be one of the biggest-ever mining stock debuts in Canada. According to one of the people, VHM has completed a three-stage IPO preparation plan that lasted roughly three years. Both parent Votorantim and VMH hired four international investment banking firms to underwrite the IPO, the people said, declining to name them. The people spoke under condition of anonymity because the plan remains private. Reuters first reported the plan on April 10.[nL1N1HI0V6] Both VHM and Votorantim, which is controlled by Brazil's billionaire Ermirio de Moraes family, declined to comment on  market speculation.  In a statement, they said  the evaluation of strategic options aims to bring about the best outcome for the group and for shareholders.   An IPO would give VMH access to a wide base of investors betting on a long-term recovery in zinc, copper, lead and silver prices. More than half of all global mining financings last year were raised on Toronto's TSX and TSX Venture exchanges.

VMH also has sales offices in Houston and Luxembourg. Last year, investments in zinc and byproducts represented 11 percent of Votorantim's capital spending of about $3 billion. Those investments included efforts to extend the working life of the Vazante mine in Brazil for another 10 years. Proceeds may also come in handy for Votorantim, Brazil's largest diversified industrial group, to grow in energy and other core sectors while cutting debt, which stands now at about 15 billion reais ($4.6 billion). People told Reuters in April that Morgan Stanley & Co, JPMorgan Chase & Co and Bank of America Corp were vying for underwriting spots for VMH's IPO.

Official figures on Wednesday will have complicated the debate among Bank of England officials over the need for higher interest rates. Sterling bounced higher against the dollar, after data showed that the unemployment rate in the period between March and May fell to its lowest since 1975 at 4.5 percent, below the average forecast of 4.6 percent in a Reuters poll of economists. But lacklustre wage growth also showed the challenge facing Prime Minister Theresa May and her minority government, with growing signs that households are feeling the strain of rising prices since last year's Brexit vote. The Office for National Statistics said pay including bonuses, adjusted for inflation, fell by 0.7 percent in the three months to May compared with a year earlier -- the sharpest drop since mid-2014. Excluding bonuses, it fell 0.5 percent. In nominal terms, total earnings rose by an annual 1.8 percent, the weakest increase since the three months to November 2014 and compared with 2.1 percent in the period to April. This was in line with the Reuters poll consensus. Inflation hit an almost four-year high of 2.9 percent in May, official data showed last month, a bigger increase than economists had expected. BoE Deputy Governor Ben Broadbent signalled his reluctance to raise interest rates in an interview published on Wednesday, and the latest figures broadly confirmed policymakers' existing views of the labour market.  All of this suggests that a 2017 rate hike from the Bank of England still looks unlikely, particularly in light of the dovish comments from Broadbent this morning,  said James Smith, an economist at Dutch bank ING. Broadbent said his caution stemmed in part from uncertainty in businesses about the outlook for Brexit - something that is putting the British government's creditworthiness under strain, ratings agency Moody's said on Tuesday. But some economists said the very low unemployment rate was likely to raise concerns among other BoE policymakers -- some of whom have voted for a rate hike -- that the economy is running at full capacity and that wage growth could soon take off, pushing inflation higher. Inflation The central bank is watching wage growth closely as it gauges whether the increase in inflation is creating longer-lasting pressure on prices. It expects wages to rise by 2 percent this year before picking up in 2018 and 2019. The health of the labour market is also a big political issue in Britain. On Tuesday Prime Minister Theresa May pledged more help for  gig economy  workers. This part of the workforce has been growing, which partly explains why average wage growth has been so poor despite record employment.

The decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in New Orleans comes more than two years after the judges halted the execution of convicted murderer Scott Panetti to consider his appeal over being denied an appointed counsel and funding for a mental health expert and investigator. Panetti, in his late 50s, was convicted of fatally shooting his wife's parents in the central Texas town of Fredericksburg in 1992. Tuesday's decision reverses a 2014 order by U.S. District Judge Sam Sparks in Austin, Texas. It sends Panetti's case back to the U.S. District Court, telling the judge to appoint a lawyer for Panetti, authorize federal funds for a mental health expert and investigator to aid him in his defense, and  conduct any further proceedings to determine afresh Panetti's competency to be executed.   Delivery of the process due protects the prisoner and in doing so protects us all,  Judge Patrick Higginbotham wrote in a 19-page opinion and order. Texas prosecutors said Panetti shaved his head and armed himself with a sawed-off shotgun and broke into the home of Joe and Amanda Alvarado, killing the two with his wife and daughter witnessing him shoot dead his mother-in-law. Panetti represented himself at his 1995 trial, often speaking incoherently and seeking to call Jesus Christ and President John F. Kennedy as defense witnesses. He was sentenced to death in 1995. The Eighth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution requires a criminal defendant to have a rational understanding of why he is being put to death and the effect of the death penalty. A representative for Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Paxton's office has said a number of courts have ruled Panetti competent to stand trial and to be executed. Greg Wiercioch and Kathryn Kase, attorneys for Panetti, said in an e-mailed statement they were grateful the court found Panetti's decades of documented schizophrenia sufficient to obtain experts and resources to pursue the claim that he is currently incompetent for execution.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/texas-execution-idUSL1N1K30AF"},

Acquisitions and joint ventures are becoming more difficult for Chinese firms, Hu Zhijian, president of the Chinese Academy of Science and Technology for Development (CASTED), told reporters in Beijing on Wednesday.  It is not wise for the U.S. to close its doors in industries that are declining in profit ... the United States should step forward and develop new technology areas,  said Hu.   U.S. regulators have called for heightened scrutiny of Chinese chip acquisitions leading to a chill in overseas M&A; activity by Chinese chip firms, with a number of high-level deals failing to gain approval. In December the Obama administration blocked China's Fujian Grand Chip Investment Fund (FGC) from completing the acquisition of German semiconductor firm Aixtron (AIXGn.DE) over national security concerns related to Aixtron's U.S. assets. In March China-backed buyout fund Canyon Bridge Capital Partners LLC resubmitted a $1.3 billion bid for U.S. chip firm Lattice Semiconductor Corp (LSCC.O) to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) after the initial review period expired. More than 20 U.S. Congress members signed a letter to the U.S. Treasury in December calling for a block on the Lattice deal, saying it could disrupt the U.S. military supply chain and increase reliance on foreign chipmakers.  The United States should not be afraid of other countries catching up,  Hu said, adding that China is seeking technologies the United States has already developed in the past two decades and Chinese investment could boot profitability in the sector. Washington recently sought to strengthen the role of CFIUS, the inter-agency committee that reviews foreign acquisitions of U.S. companies on national security grounds. U.S. politicians and lawmakers have called for the committee to increase deal scrutiny in areas where China is seeking to build world-leading technology, including artificial intelligence.  China will release a national artificial intelligence plan in the coming months, following a similar roadmap released by the United States, Hu said.

The complaint is the telecom company's first official acknowledgement of a systems breach. Jio has so far denied media reports and user accounts of a leak. The officer involved in the investigation said Jio filed the complaint on Monday in Navi Mumbai, where it is headquartered. Jio, part of conglomerate Reliance Industries Ltd (RELI.NS), did not respond to a Reuters request for comment on Wednesday. Several local news sites reported late on Sunday that names, telephone numbers and email addresses of Jio users were visible on a site called 'Magicapk,' which was subsequently taken down. Jio, headed by India's richest man Mukesh Ambani, rubbished the website's claims and said its subscriber data was safe and maintained with the highest security. It said that data on the 'Magicapk' website appeared to be  unauthentic.  Many local news outlets such as Indian Express and MediaNama however, contradicted these claims. They reported being able to cross reference and confirm the veracity of the data on numerous Jio customers known to them.   Experts say India has inadequate data protection laws that do not mandate companies or agencies to notify clients if their personal data has been breached. Advocates for stronger data protection laws say this results in data leaks often going unreported.  There is a clear stigma attached to being hacked, or data being stolen,  said Akash Mahajan, a web security consultant in Bengaluru, adding this is why companies in India often do not admit to data breaches.  Aadhaar Appears Safe On Tuesday, Reuters reported that police in the western state of Rajasthan detained a man on suspicion of involvement in the breach, which cyber security analysts say could be the first large-scale leak from an Indian telecoms firm. The officer involved in the matter declined to give further detail on the investigation, but said preliminary evidence indicated the widely-used  Aadhaar  numbers of Jio customers were not compromised in the leak.  Jio, which launched last September, already boasts over 100 million subscribers after drawing in users with months of free service and now cut-price deals. It is not clear whether data on all 100 million plus customers was compromised. Many users registered for Jio using their 12-digit Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) number, commonly known as the Aadhaar number.  The government is pushing for Aadhaar numbers to be used in everything from opening a bank account to filing tax returns. The number, which works in a similar way to U.S. Social Security numbers, is unique to each Indian citizen and stores users' biometric data in a centralized database. The case was registered under Section 66 of the Information Technology Act, which deals with any unauthorized access to a computer network, and Section 379 of the Indian Penal Code, which deals with theft.

The data suggest that the insurers we rate are better capitalised than the market as a whole and does not lead us to materially change our view of their capitalisation based on our Prism factor-based capital model. Excluding transitional benefits, rated life groups all had ratios above 135% but more than one-third of life insurers in the market had ratios below 100%, meaning they were relying on transitional measures to meet end-2016 regulatory solvency requirements. Transitional measures are designed to smooth the impact of S2, which came into effect in 2016. European insurers had to publish new, more detailed S2 disclosures by 1 July, including own funds and solvency capital requirements without the benefit of transitional measures on technical provisions (TMTPs). We have stripped out the impact of TMTPs to analyse underlying S2 ratios for rated insurers in the German life sector, where large asset-liability duration gaps on business with long-term investment guarantees generate significant exposure to low yields. Until now, this exposure was largely hidden by local accounting and widespread use of TMTPs, which mitigate the increase in provisions for interest-sensitive business triggered by S2. We believe S2 ratios excluding TMTPs should be reasonably comparable between German life insurers, giving a meaningful indication of their relative capital strength taking account of their exposure to interest-rate risk. We have analysed these ratios for life insurance groups rather than solo entities, consistent with our view of capital management and fungibility between entities in these groups. Among rated groups with mainly life business, the S2 ratios excluding TMTPs give a similar picture to our existing view of capital based on Prism, with LV 1871 and Alte Leipziger clearly the strongest according to both S2 and Prism. <iframe allowfullscreen src= //e.infogram.com/german_life_s2_ratios?src=embed  title= German Life S2 Ratios  width= 750  height= 327  scrolling= no  frameborder= 0 > Volkswohl Bund, Nuernberger and Stuttgarter appear weaker and we have previously indicated that their Prism scores may come under pressure as a consequence of persistent low investment yields. However, they all have headroom over the 100% regulatory minimum even without TMTPs (and very strong regulatory positions given that the regulator allows credit for TMTPs). Comparison of the newly disclosed S2 ratios with existing Prism scores does not lead us to materially change our view of capital for these insurers. We will update our analysis of each insurer's capital as part of our rating review cycle, continuing our focus on Prism scores and analysis of asset-liability profiles, supplemented with further analysis of S2 ratios and other information from solvency financial condition reports. Most of Germany's 84 life insurers use transitional measures and 29 companies (none rated by Fitch) would be below minimum regulatory requirements without them, according to the German regulator, BaFin. A proposed reduction in the ultimate forward rate used for valuing long-duration liabilities would increase this dependency by weakening underlying S2 ratios. Although BaFin allows insurers to use transitional measures, reliance on these to meet minimum requirements indicates underlying capital weakness on an economic basis, common in Germany given the prevalence of interest-sensitive business. Insurers in this predicament typically face the dual challenge of managing the run-off of the business that generates this weakness and adjusting their business model in response to low yields and S2 capital requirements. Insurers with liabilities that outlast the 16-year transitional measures may be particularly exposed to these pressures. The weakest companies may become acquisition targets for stronger insurers. Our sector outlook for German life insurance, an indicator of fundamental trends, is negative, reflecting the pressures from low investment yields.

Ethnic Malay Muslims make up more than 60 percent of Malaysia's 32 million people and attempts to implement stricter forms of sharia law in recent years have raised concerns among members of the ethnic Chinese, Indian and other minorities. The new law was approved in the state assembly of Kelantan, which is governed by a conservative Islamist party, PAS, and where nightclubs and cinemas are banned. The northeastern state has been pushing for the adoption of a strict Islamic penal code, called 'hudud', that would provide for punishments such as stoning for adultery and amputations for theft. The amendment allowing public caning was passed as part of an effort to streamline sentencing under Islamic criminal law, Kelantan deputy chief minister Mohd Amar Nik Abdullah was quoted as saying by the Bernama state news agency.  Caning can now be carried out inside or outside of prison, depending on the court's decision,  Mohd Amar said, according to Bernama.  This is in line with the religion, which requires that sentencing must be done in public.  He did not say exactly what crimes would be punished by caning but the list would likely include adultery. Islamic law is implemented in all Malaysian states but is restricted to family issues such as divorce and inheritance, as well as sharia crimes involving Muslims, such as consuming alcohol and adultery. Criminal cases are handled by federal law. Ti Lian Ker, a member of the Malaysian Chinese Association, part of the ruling coalition, said public canings were unconstitutional under federal criminal law.  This is a rewriting of our legal system and spells a bleak future for the nation,  he said in a statement. Last year, the PAS introduced a bill that would expand the powers of sharia courts and incorporate parts of hudud into the existing legal system. The bill is expected to be debated in parliament when it reconvenes later this month. Critics of the bill say the implementation of hudud could infringe on the rights of religious minorities and disrupt the fabric of Malaysia's multi-ethnic and multi-religious society.

The cost of natural disasters to some of the world's poorest countries has averaged a total of $29.1 billion a year in the past 15 years, catastrophe modeling firm RMS said. While aid has covered 8 percent of this, insurance has only paid for 3 percent of the average costs of earthquakes, drought or floods in 77 low and low-middle income countries, or $900 million, but could cover up to $6.8 billion if more insurance structures were used, RMS said in the report prepared for Britain's Department for International Development. Britain said at last weekend's G20 meeting it would set up the London Centre for Global Disaster Protection to help developing countries use insurance to cut disaster costs.  FILE PHOTO: Rohingya refugee children smiles while holding an umbrella during heavy rain at the Kutupalang Makeshift Refugee Camp in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh, July 8, 2017.Mohammad Ponir Hossain/File Photo There is clear potential for insurance to both reduce the shortfall in funding for natural disaster losses in low and low-middle income countries, and to relieve pressure on humanitarian aid budgets,  RMS said. This includes using so-called  parametric  structures, where insurance payments are triggered by a predetermined factor, such as an increase in water height, at a specified location. Such models are used in existing insurance facilities such as African Risk Capacity and make payments more effective. On a disaster loss of $30 billion, every dollar paid out through parametric insurance has the same impact as $3.50 of slower-moving aid payments, RMS said.  It's not just about speed, it's about certainty,  said Daniel Stander, global head of the firm's public sector group, adding that parametric insurance enables countries to know in advance how much money they will receive in a disaster.

The complaint is the telecom company's first official acknowledgement of a systems breach. Jio has so far denied media reports and user accounts of a leak. The officer involved in the investigation said Jio filed the complaint on Monday in Navi Mumbai, where it is headquartered. Jio, part of conglomerate Reliance Industries Ltd (RELI.NS), did not respond to a Reuters request for comment on Wednesday. Several local news sites reported late on Sunday that names, telephone numbers and email addresses of Jio users were visible on a site called 'Magicapk,' which was subsequently taken down. Jio, headed by India's richest man Mukesh Ambani, rubbished the website's claims and said its subscriber data was safe and maintained with the highest security. It said that data on the 'Magicapk' website appeared to be  unauthentic.  Many local news outlets such as Indian Express and MediaNama however, contradicted these claims. They reported being able to cross reference and confirm the veracity of the data on numerous Jio customers known to them.   Experts say India has inadequate data protection laws that do not mandate companies or agencies to notify clients if their personal data has been breached. Advocates for stronger data protection laws say this results in data leaks often going unreported.  There is a clear stigma attached to being hacked, or data being stolen,  said Akash Mahajan, a web security consultant in Bengaluru, adding this is why companies in India often do not admit to data breaches.  Aadhaar Appears Safe On Tuesday, Reuters reported that police in the western state of Rajasthan detained a man on suspicion of involvement in the breach, which cyber security analysts say could be the first large-scale leak from an Indian telecoms firm. The officer involved in the matter declined to give further detail on the investigation, but said preliminary evidence indicated the widely-used  Aadhaar  numbers of Jio customers were not compromised in the leak.  Jio, which launched last September, already boasts over 100 million subscribers after drawing in users with months of free service and now cut-price deals. It is not clear whether data on all 100 million plus customers was compromised. Many users registered for Jio using their 12-digit Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) number, commonly known as the Aadhaar number.  The government is pushing for Aadhaar numbers to be used in everything from opening a bank account to filing tax returns. The number, which works in a similar way to U.S. Social Security numbers, is unique to each Indian citizen and stores users' biometric data in a centralized database. The case was registered under Section 66 of the Information Technology Act, which deals with any unauthorized access to a computer network, and Section 379 of the Indian Penal Code, which deals with theft.

The deal sees ING transfer risk from complex equity derivative products and associated hedges to BNPP through a series of trades. The deal will also see BNPP service around 250 structured notes on behalf of ING, according to people familiar with the agreement. The first transfer has already taken place and the deal is scheduled to complete by year-end. A spokesperson at ING confirmed that BNPP was selected in May for a deal that includes a risk transfer of products and hedges and a joint exercise to novate over-the-counter trades in the portfolio. The bank declined to confirm the size of the portfolio or other details relating to the trade. A BNPP spokesperson also confirmed the deal but did not confirm additional details surrounding the size of the trade. The arrangement is the latest sign of consolidation in the ultra-competitive structured products market. Post-crisis reforms including stringent capital rules have heaped additional costs on structured products businesses, which have also been hit by low rates and a flight from complexity. While smaller players have retreated, larger firms that have been able to reduce costs with fully automated platforms have seized the opportunity to expand activities through the acquisition of competitor portfolios. BNPP has been at the forefront of that trend, buoyed by its  Smart Derivatives  platform that offers structured equities to more than 3,000 users. In 2013, the bank fought off tough competition to acquire RBS's structured retail investor products business and flow equity derivatives activities. That deal covered assets with a notional value around US$200bn and included risk transfer on a 1,000-product portfolio of retail structured products. While the latest ING deal is smaller and less complex, given that it does not include retail assets that are quoted on exchange, the exercise covers around 900 client trades and will see OTC swaps with around 100 counterparties novated to the French bank, according to people familiar with the agreement. The deal comes alongside signs of a turnaround for the structured products business, which suffered in 2016 against a backdrop of sluggish equity markets that meant autocallable notes did not knock out. Issuance is running around 20% up so far this year, driven by demand from Japan and Europe. The EuroStoxx 50, a key underlying for structured notes, is up more than 5% so far in 2017. Hurdles for profitability remain, however, particularly stemming from sweeping MiFID II reforms, which require note issuers to provide best execution disclosures on each trade. The French bank has a track record in portfolio integration following its 2009 acquisition of a 75% stake in Fortis. In 2012, the bank acquired 1,600 structured products from Macquarie and followed up a year later with the purchase of a €12.5bn equity derivatives book from Credit Agricole, which saw the bank provide full front to back-office services. That activity was believed to have been a key factor in the agreement with RBS in late 2013.

The Philippines suspended exploration at the Reed Bank, which it calls Recto Bank, in late 2014, as it pursued international arbitration over territorial disputes. The bank is in waters claimed by China. Ismael Ocampo, director at the Department of Energy's Resource Development Bureau, told reporters the agency expected the suspension to be lifted in December. He said a directive from the Department of Foreign Affairs directing the Department of Energy to resume oil and gas exploration in the South China Sea was already in the works. China claims almost the entire South China Sea, where about $5 trillion worth of sea-borne goods pass every year. Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Vietnam and Taiwan also have claims. Exactly a year ago, the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague invalidated China's claim to sovereignty over most of the South China Sea. The ruling, which China refused to recognize, clarified Philippine sovereign rights in its 200-mile Exclusive Economic Zone to access offshore oil and gas fields, including the Reed Bank, 85 nautical miles off its coast.  We will try to conduct seismic activities,  in the disputed waters, Ocampo said, hopeful that China would not complain and harass crews of survey ships to be deployed.  In 2011, Chinese patrol vessels almost rammed a survey ship at the Reed Bank contracted by a PXP Energy Corp (PXP.PS) unit. President Rodrigo Duterte, who took power shortly before the Hague ruled in favor of Manila, has said he would raise the landmark ruling with China eventually, but he first needed to strengthen relations between the two countries. Duterte, who has been cool toward old ally the United States, hopes closer ties with China will yield billions of dollars in loans and investment in infrastructure, the backbone of his economic agenda. PXP Energy Chairman Manuel Pangilinan said in March he was optimistic his company's exploration project at Reed Bank would soon resume, citing the warming ties with China. The Philippines, which relies overwhelmingly on imports to fuel its fast-growing economy, is under pressure to develop indigenous energy resources. Its main source of natural gas, the Malampaya field near the disputed waters, is due to run out in less a decade. PXP's Reed Bank prospect has indicated natural gas yield potential. More than two dozen oil, gas and coal blocks, including additional areas in disputed waters, may be offered during the December bidding, Ocampo said.

The Basel III agreement, written by the global Basel Committee, aims to tightens capital requirements after the 2007-09 financial crisis. The bulk of the rules are being implemented, but final elements are gridlocked by disagreement.  I sincerely hope that we can reach a balanced agreement among Basel Committee members by next autumn,  Villeroy, who is also governor of the Bank of France, told a financial services conference in Paris on Wednesday. Efforts to wrap up the talks have so far floundered over a proposed  floor  which would mean capital cannot fall below 75 percent of the  standard  approach set out by regulators and used by most lenders, while big banks use models to add up risks instead.  Should the output floor be set at too high a level, the consequences in terms of the reduction of risk sensitivity and the increase in capital requirements would be unacceptable: for example, a 75 percent output floor would affect half of international banks,  Villeroy said. He added that bank solvency had become less of a pressing issue for financial stability than liquidity of non-banks, various investment vehicles and funds hat have seen the levels of assets they hold surge since the financial crisis. Villeroy said authorities should conduct  system-wide  liquidity stress tests to get a grip on potential risks of a  fund-run  when markets get tough.

Our production has turned out to be better than predicted,  the country's Director General of Oil and Gas, Wiratmaja Puja, told reporters on Wednesday.  So there's a high possibility we won't need to import in 2019.  Puja was referring to higher-than-expected output from the Jangkrik gas field operated by Eni. The field was designed to produce 450 million cubic feet per day of gas but output could be up to 600 million cubic feet per day, he said. Currently the world's fifth-biggest exporter of LNG, Indonesia has lost market share to new production from Australia and Qatar and as output is reserved for domestic needs. However, the domestic gas market has not developed as anticipated even after the government promoted the fuel to replace coal for power plants and as an industrial fuel. Power plant developers in Indonesia are still relying on cheaper coal, however, which has curtailed the development of gas infrastructure. [reut.rs/2tM1Ade]  Puja also called into question imports after 2020 when he mentioned BP's Tangguh Train 3 project will supply more gas to Indonesia from 2020 onwards.  At the end of 2020 we won't need to import,  he added. The comments come even as Australia's Woodside Petroleum inked a contract in April to supply Indonesia's state-owned energy company Pertamina with LNG from 2019 to 2034. Pertamina also has a LNG import deal with U.S.-based Cheniere Energy Inc from 2018 and Exxon Mobil Corp from 2025. Puja suggested those supplies could be redirected to other LNG buyers in Asia, particularly Bangladesh.  We are pushing Pertamina to go global,  he said. When contacted by Reuters, Pertamina's Vice President for LNG, Didik Sasongko, supported that idea.   We can use it for trading or to optimise Pertamina's LNG portfolio,  Sasongko said, referring to the Cheniere deal.  There's flexibility on delivery,  he said when asked about the Woodside imports. Meanwhile, Puja said that Indonesia is looking for buyers for 16 to 18 uncommitted LNG cargoes for this year. He expects an average of 50 to 60 uncommitted cargoes per year until 2035.

The talks were for unspecified volumes of diesel for loading from its Ruwais refinery over July 2017 to June 2018 but they have been stalled because ADNOC may be setting aside the fuel as back up for power generation needs, especially as temperatures soar above 40 degrees Celsius, said three sources familiar with the matter.  (ADNOC) is still calculating its demand for local requirements,  one of the sources familiar with the matter said, speaking on condition of anonymity as he was not authorized to speak with the media.  However, an ADNOC spokesman said that the term talks for diesel are ongoing.  The United Arab Emirates generates all of its electricity using natural gas. However, the country is considering back-up plans after a diplomatic dispute with Qatar, said a second source. Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the UAE and Egypt imposed sanctions on Qatar last month, accusing it of financing extremist groups and allying with the Gulf Arab states' arch-foe Iran, allegations that Doha denies.  Qatar exports 1.7 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas to the Abu Dhabi Water and Electric Co and the Dubai Supply Authority through the Dolphin Energy undersea pipeline, according to Dolphin's website. There are concerns that Qatar may shut off the pipeline, requiring the use of diesel to run back-up power generation, though Qatar Petroleum's chief executive has said Qatar will not cut off gas to the UAE. Additionally there are concerns about domestic diesel supply in the UAE.  Ruwais, which can process 800,000 barrels-per-day of crude, suffered a fire at a secondary unit in January that curtailed diesel output. The unit is not expected to be back up until at least late 2018 or early 2019. This was also a factor in stalled diesel talks, the first source said. ADNOC is expected to return to the table to discuss the contract in one to two weeks though this is still uncertain, the source added. The diesel contract is for a one year period with an option for buyers to review prices towards the year-end, as oil price agency S&P; Global Platts will be making changes to its benchmark diesel grade.

Decent demand at a sale of German 10-year bonds, the first auction of the long-dated debt since a sharp selloff began two weeks ago, helped boost sentiment. But it was the U.S. that held the spotlight. Investors were awaiting Congressional testimony by U.S. Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen, as well as the fallout over a chain of emails that showed President Donald Trump's eldest son welcoming help from a Russian lawyer during his father's 2016 election campaign against Hillary Clinton.  There's a little bit of nervousness in the market after the news overnight from the U.S. and ahead of the Yellen speech,  said DZ Bank strategist Christian Lenk.  Also it helps that yields are now at high levels, that might be driving some of the flows.  Yellen will testify to Congress on the state of the U.S. economy and markets will be watching the speech closely for any clues on rate hikes and the plan for reducing the Fed's balance sheet. While the latest U.S. employment figures beat expectations, economic data from the world's biggest economy has been patchy this year and has generally been outperformed by the euro zone. On Tuesday, two of Yellen's colleagues cited low wage growth and muted inflation as reasons for caution on further interest rate increases. BBVA strategist Jaime Costero Denche said the tone Yellen adopts on inflation will be key; an upbeat assessment would imply that the Fed is primed to go ahead with unwinding post-crisis monetary stimulus. Higher-rated euro zone government bonds, which are considered amongst the safest financial assets in the world, were lower 3-4 basis points across the curve. Germany's 10-year government bond yield fell 3 bps to 0.53 percent, extending its decline after a sale of around 4 billion euros of new 10-year Bunds.  Our expectation going into the auction was that the 60 basis point yield would be a good level for outright investors to enter the market, so I'm not surprised it went well,  said Mizuho rates strategist Antoine Bouvet. Bund yields are now more than double their 0.25 percent level of two weeks ago, when European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi triggered a selloff in euro zone government bond markets by suggesting the bank was open to policy tweaks. Portugal also held a debt auction, selling a 28-year bond - the longest-dated maturity it has placed in a regular auction since before the 2010 debt crisis.

Grain traders have struggled with rising competition in Russia, one of the world's largest wheat exporters, in recent years, while their trading margins have also been squeezed.     Bunge's move highlights rising competition in deep-water ports in Russia's part of the Black Sea, from which traders supply grain by large ships to customers such as Egypt, the world's largest wheat importer.  The shallow-water ports of the Azov Sea usually supply grain by smaller ships to customers like Turkey.  Concentrating operations on a company-owned shallow water port terminal could give the advantage of low costs for niche business,  one trader said. Bunge is the  B  of the so-called ABCDs of global grain trading, which also include rivals Archer Daniels Midland Co, Cargill Inc and Louis Dreyfus Co.  Bunge is re-focusing and consolidating its Russian grain origination activities in Rostov-on-Don, where we have an export terminal, helping us achieve greater efficiencies,  Bunge spokeswoman Susan Burns said. Bunge has already closed offices in Russia's Black Sea port of Novorossiisk and in Yeisk. It will also close the office in Stavropol this autumn, while its office in Voronezh will remain open for seeds origination, but not for grain purchases.  Russia will remain an important origin for Bunge, and we remain committed to having an asset footprint,  Burns said. Bunge, which also has a sunflower oil plant in Russia and a grain terminal in Ukraine, was Russia's 14th largest grain exporter in the 2016/17 marketing year, which ended on June 30, with a 2 percent share, or 723,000 tonnes, the state Grain Quality Service said. The bulk of Bunge's supplies go through shallow-water ports.   To make money in the increasingly competitive Russian export sector you need a critical mass of high volume business. It is thought that Bunge's deep-sea exports have been too small a volume in recent years,  a German trader said.  It looks like overhead costs are being reduced and more niche business will be developed,  the trader added.

Yet the Cuban designer must rummage through trash bins and scour the sidewalks of Havana for scraps of wood and obsolete electrical devices to manufacture them. In Communist-run Cuba, designers of clothes and household goods say the absence of wholesale stores as well as the expense and scarcity of raw materials have forced them to get creative. Many turn to repurposing and recycling the materials at hand. These pioneers of the island's fledgling private sector say they are turning a competitive disadvantage into an asset, while yielding unique, ecologically-friendly designs.  It's not easy to get the materials so we have to adapt and improvise a lot,  said Alejo, 37, whose lamps contain salt crystals.  Some 50-60 percent is recycled material.  Alejo said he asks carpenters for their leftover scraps and uses the frames of discarded windows and doors in order to make the wooden bases for his lamps. He also salvages the switches, plugs and cables from old electrical devices.  They are extremely expensive, and there isn't a regular supply in stores,  he said, adding his company Luzvi still must import some inputs - like lightbulbs with a softer glow than Cuba's starkly white, energy-saving ones. The new lamps sell for between $25 and $50, a relatively hefty sum in a country where the average monthly state salary is around $30. Lower input costs would enable Alejo to cut prices, he said. The government has allowed more Cubans to set up their own businesses in recent years as part of its plan to update its ailing, Soviet-style economy and cut the bloated state payroll. A child tries a school uniform at a recycling store in Havana, Cuba, July 5, 2017.Alexandre MeneghiniThe number of Cuba's self-employed more than tripled in six years to above 500,000 by the end of 2016, official data shows. Some entrepreneurs complain, however, that the government has not followed through on certain reforms. For example, the country's small, private businesses still do not have access to the wholesale market. Raw materials are often in short supply and expensive, although Havana puts that down to the half-century-old U.S. trade blockade. Slideshow (7 Images)Caridad Limonta, whose family firm Procle sells women's apparel and home goods, said new textiles were costly so she mostly bought clothes or hotel curtains and sheets at state-run, second-hand stores and recycled them.  I transform trousers for example into bags,  said the 60-year-old entrepreneur.  The backs of shirts don't damage as much so I cut them, stick them together and make patchwork quilts.  Limonta said Cubans are not in the habit of throwing things away, and find new uses for them instead. At Procle, shoulder pads become sponges for the kitchen, while old curtains are reinvented as tablecloths. While Limonta said she wished it were easier to buy textiles, she also does not want Cuba to adopt the same kind of  fast fashion  prevalent in consumerist economies where clothes are cheap but often disposable, generating trash. In the business district of Vedado, just around the corner from Procle, is the Vintage Bazar, a shop that refurbishes old lamps as well as designs quirky new ones with anything from plumbing pipes to water bottles.  In other countries you would throw away the lamp and buy a new one,  said designer Gretel Serrano, 32, who is currently refurbishing a large batch of lamps for a hotel.

The man behind the confiscation of General Motors Co’s $100 million assembly plant in April is a much more obscure figure: Kaled Kansao, the owner of two long-defunct GM dealerships. Kansao convinced a court to seize the plant as the remedy for a relatively small-time business dispute - over GM's termination of his franchises - that mushroomed into a 17-year court battle. The legal fight that pushed GM out of Venezuela offers a unique case study in the struggles of foreign corporations to keep operations afloat - much less turn a profit - amid the OPEC nation's economic and political chaos. The seizure stands out because it stems from a dispute with private citizens rather than the government, highlighting yet another risk of doing business in Venezuela – the specter of debilitating legal judgments, said Francisco Martinez, president of Venezuela's main business organization, Fedecamaras.  It would be impossible to say that the legal proceedings against General Motors had any legal logic,  Martinez said.  Venezuela does not provide even the most minimal guarantees with respect to investment or private property.  The Venezuelan government's Information Ministry did not respond to a request for comment. Venezuela ranked 187 out of 190 countries in the World Bank's 2017 Ease of Doing Business report, which evaluates countries' regulatory systems. Only Eritrea, Libya and Somalia scored worse. Under Chavez, the socialist firebrand who died in 2013, some asset seizures featured gun-wielding soldiers and live television broadcasts. The GM case had its own less publicized drama, including dueling allegations of courthouse misdeeds; recusals by judges citing security concerns; a dispute over 158 vehicles that GM says  vanished ; and mysterious damage calculations awarding the dealers thousands of cars. GM stopped producing vehicles here in 2015 amid a lack of access to supplies. But the judgment appears to have doused any remaining hopes that it will produce cars again in Venezuela anytime soon. The company terminated the plant's 2,700 workers after the decision. In its initial announcement in April, GM did not connect the plant seizure to the dealers' lawsuit, saying only that the facility was  unexpectedly  seized by  public authorities.  In response to inquiries from Reuters, the company provided a detailed history of its frustrations with the proceedings, which it called  absurd  and rife with  irregularities.  In the end, a civil court in the western state of Zulia granted the dealers' request to attach GM assets worth up to about $115 million. Venezuelan law requires the court to auction off the factory to satisfy the judgment. In the meantime, it ordered GM to pay the dealers to pay an  occupation fee  that at the time equated to about $36,000 a month - in effect, rent on its own plant.  The illegal and outrageous seizure was the final act of a series of unfortunate events beyond GMV's control,  GM told Reuters, referring to its Venezuela subsidiary. GM did not respond to questions about whether it had any intention of paying the court judgments or trying to regain control of the factory. In a May press statement, Kansao and his business partner, Elena Rodriguez, accused GM of perjury, influence trafficking, and violation of the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, without offering evidence. GM has ignored court rulings because it believes  might is right as a law,  Kansao told Reuters. Idled Workers Collect Salaries Back in 2000, Kansao and Rodriguez operated two GM dealerships that had originally been founded by Kansao's father. In an interview, Kansao said GM arbitrarily stripped him of his franchise, which he said brought  tragedy and calamity  on his family. GM said it terminated the agreement for a range of reasons, including the dealers' failure to meet a minimum monthly sales average of 25 vehicles. Nearly two decades later, the dealers' hopes of collecting on the judgment now hinge on whether a court-ordered auction attracts a buyer - an unlikely prospect in a nation where the auto industry has all but collapsed. Chronic shortages of hard currency have left automakers unable to import parts, while triple digit inflation has left would-be customers struggling to buy basics like food and medicine. In 2016, output at Venezuela's seven biggest auto plants had dropped below 3,000 cars, down from a peak of 172,000 vehicles in 2007 – 79,000 of those from GM, according to auto industry group Cavenez. Labor laws dictate that the dealers would also have to wait behind GM workers - who contend they are owed severance payments - to collect any proceeds from a factory auction. GM did not respond to questions about workers' severance. The automaker had agreed with union leaders to continue paying workers after the plant stopped making cars, said Adan Tortolero, one of several union leaders at the defunct plant. GM tried to shed that obligation last year by offering buyouts of about $3,500 per worker, Tortolero said, but workers spurned the offer because it seemed small in comparison to the pay and benefits the workers had previously enjoyed. One lucrative perk was the right to buy two factory cars every year at government-regulated prices that were well below their actual market value. The regulated prices were theoretically available to anyone, but because demand for cars far outstripped supply, most buyers had to get waiting lists – which usually required large under-the-table payments. GM employees had been among the first in line to buy the cars at regulated prices, which allowed them to sell the vehicles at a steep premium. 9,725 Cars In 2007, the Zulia court ordered the automaker to compensate the plaintiffs with 9,725 vehicles, according to the decision, which offered no explanation for that number of cars. It did require the plaintiffs to pay GM for the vehicles, but only after they were sold. Asked to provide evidence that the proceedings had been corrupted, GM pointed out that six judges and two court employees had recused themselves, with most citing  threats and personal security concerns.  It also said that the court failed to enforce an order preventing the dealers from selling 158 cars that they seized during the dispute. GM said those vehicles later  vanished,  and the dealers never paid for them. Kansao and Rodriguez did not respond to questions about the 158 cars. The case bounced through different courts for the next decade until April 4 of this year, when the Zulia court authorized the plaintiffs to encumber GM assets worth up to 477 billion bolivars - at the time worht about $115 million - as leverage to collect a cash judgment of half that amount. The court based the compensation on the full value of the 9,725 cars - rather than the much smaller profit the dealers would have made selling them, GM said. But the legal victory may have little payoff in reality, just as GM's losses may be largely symbolic - given that it hasn't produced or sold cars in Venezuela since 2015. Asked what sort of buyer the factory might attract in a government auction, Kansao responded:  Only God knows that.

The United States has plenty of idle equipment laying around after its own unconventional drilling boom cooled. But moving that machinery from the plains of Texas to the windswept Patagonian desert is proving complex and costly for global oil majors who say Argentina's protectionist past is slowing efforts to spark its own shale revolution. A move by Argentina's government to cut import taxes on used oil-field equipment has sparked fierce opposition from local manufacturers, who are lobbying the government to include protections for them in a measure they fear will destroy their livelihoods. Among them is Adrian Ramos, president of QM Equipment, a manufacturer of drilling and fracking equipment located in the Argentine coastal city of Mar del Plata.  We got in touch with [the Production Ministry] and let them know it was totally impossible for us to survive this,  Ramos told Reuters in a telephone interview. Negotiations with Ramos and others have slowed the rollout of tariff reductions. President Mauricio Macri in April had promised oil executives the changes would be coming within  weeks.  The previously unreported talks with local manufacturers underscore the challenges faced by Macri, who came to power in 2015 on a wave of popular discontent that ended 12 years of leftist rule. The market-friendly former businessman has pledged to revive Argentina's moribund, inflation-racked economy by reducing trade barriers and wooing foreign investment. But he has gotten blowback from industries and unions that have benefited from protectionist policies. With mid-term elections approaching in October, popular opposition to rising imports and factory layoffs has become a vulnerability for Macri's  Let's Change  coalition. Big oil firms, meanwhile, are fuming too. Vaca Muerta, a Belgium-sized shale formation located in the western Patagonian province of Neuquen, is seen as the most promising unconventional oil and gas field outside of North America, the birthplace of the shale revolution. Already burdened with pricey labor and transport costs in Argentina, companies have grown frustrated with delays in the equipment import reform. Speaking at an industry event in Buenos Aires in late June, Richard Spies, chief executive of Pan America Energy, an Argentine subsidiary of BP PLC, called on government officials to hit the accelerator.  Get these things done,  Spies said.  We need that equipment that's idle in the United States moved down here to facilitate the developments that are coming in Vaca Muerta.  In an emailed response to questions from Reuters, a Production Ministry spokesman said the import proposal was advancing and a decree would be passed by the executive branch in the coming weeks. It would not need congressional approval, the spokesman said. Bringing The  Dead Cow  to Life Argentina is one of many resource-rich Latin American countries that have struggled to develop abundant oil and mineral reserves. Rules aimed at protecting domestic players and guaranteeing large revenues for government have chased away some foreign investors. New right-leaning governments in the region have introduced business-friendly policies to lure them back. Brazil's Congress in 2016 opened the nation's deepwater pre-salt fields to foreign operators. This year Peru lowered air-quality standards to attract mining investment. Spurring development of Vaca Muerta - Spanish for 'Dead Cow' - is one of Macri's major priorities as he tries to unwind regulations put in place by his predecessor Cristina Fernandez. Argentina holds the world's second-largest shale gas reserves, but it imports a quarter of its energy needs, one reason for the country's $7-billion current account deficit. Macri has promised rail and pipeline projects to connect remote Vaca Muerta to markets and ports. Most crucially, he struck a deal with unions in January to reduce notoriously high labor costs. Still, production costs remain well above those of global competitors. Prices at the Loma Campana field, jointly operated by state-run oil company YPF SA and Chevron Corp exceed $43 per barrel, compared with $32 in the Niobrara in Colorado and Wyoming. (For a look at Argentine shale activity, see tmsnrt.rs/2uPm98U) Used oil equipment can currently be imported at tariffs ranging from 7 percent to 28 percent, with imports of some types of machinery banned, the Energy Ministry said in an emailed statement to Reuters. The proposed change would eliminate the bans, lower tariffs to between 0 percent and 7 percent and provide a form of compensation for companies that buy locally produced equipment, the Ministry said. It added that it has been meeting with drillers, oil services companies and local manufacturers about the rule.  Evidently this dialogue process has taken time,  a ministry spokesman wrote.  We expect the decree to be signed soon.  Compete or 'Disappear' Local companies fear the changes could be devastating. Everaldo Santa Cruz is head of the oil and gas business at HTI SA, a maker of drilling and hydraulic fracturing equipment in Canuelas, Buenos Aires province. He said HTI has invested heavily in building frac pumps to supply drillers in Vaca Muerta, and that the $1.2 million price tag is comparable with that of U.S. manufacturers. But Santa Cruz said he worries he will never get to fully develop that part of his business if the decree is passed. HTI doesn't stand a chance if his customers are allowed to import equipment they already own from the United States, paying only transport costs and the lowered tariffs, he said.  We understand that it can speed up production to an extent,  Santa Cruz said.  But there's a risk that companies like ours that try to develop local solutions to support the industry simply disappear.

Wells, which was the No. 2 U.S. provider of auto loans less than a year ago, has already cut quarterly originations by nearly 30 percent over the nine months leading into March 31, according to a May 11 company presentation. It has also begun consolidating the collections operation in a move that people familiar with the business say could eliminate hundreds of jobs, after a new head of auto finance took the reins in April. Wells Fargo joins other lenders in reducing exposure to the rapidly cooling U.S. auto market. Bankers, auto industry executives, analysts and regulators have been warning since 2014 that the auto loan market could overheat after being fueled for years by low interest rates and easy financing terms. Chasing growth, some lenders, including Wells Fargo, began to embrace borrowers with shaky credit. In late 2015, however, auto default rates began creeping above other types of consumer debt, according to data compiled by Cox Automotive, prompting some lenders to tighten standards and edge away from the market. Wells Fargo began curtailing its auto exposure beginning last year. It cut the share of subprime loans in the auto portfolio to 8 over percent in the first quarter from over 11 percent a year earlier, according to a company presentation.  Analysts expect to see higher delinquency and default rates when Wells Fargo reports results on Friday.  The general view, which they've been pretty clear about, is that loan growth will be negative for next two to three quarters,  said Brian Foran, an analyst at Autonomous Research. He expects the auto pullback to shave roughly one percentage point off Wells Fargo's net interest income growth over time. The bank's executives have acknowledged that tightening of standards comes at a price.  Wells Fargo is willing to give up volume and share in order to protect its balance sheet from credit risk,  Franklin Codel, the bank's head of consumer lending, told the bank's investor day in May. At the same event, Chief Executive Officer Tim Sloan singled out auto loans as the business with the biggest potential for a  negative credit event.  A Wells Fargo spokeswoman declined to comment for this story beyond what executives have already said about auto lending. As Wells Fargo's auto loan originations have dropped, it has slipped to No. 7 from No. 2 among top U.S. auto lenders, according to Experian Automotive. The bank also began a revamp of its auto business early this year as part of a broad overhaul following a sales scandal that has roiled the third-largest U.S. bank by assets. In April, Laura Schupbach took over management of the auto business, months after her predecessor, Dawn Martin Harp, announced plans to leave. Schupbach is a 22-year Wells Fargo veteran who most recently ran its insurance business after various roles in finance and expenses, according to her corporate biography. Weeks later, the bank began the process of moving collections staff from 57 locations across the country to three central hubs in Raleigh, North Carolina, Irving, Texas and Chandler, Arizona, according to an internal memo viewed by Reuters. People with knowledge of the business say hundreds of positions will likely be eliminated. A bank spokeswoman declined to say how many jobs might be lost, and would not authorize an interview with Schupbach. Martin Harp could not be reached. Less Independence The auto lending shake-up, some details of which were first reported by Auto Finance News, is the latest indication that Wells Fargo's top management is seeking greater control over businesses that traditionally operated with much independence. In interviews, three people who have worked inside the auto lending operation raised questions about what impact the abandoning of the  run it like you own it  philosophy will have in the long term. In recent years auto lending delivered nearly twice as much in revenue per dollar of expenses as the overall bank, according to people familiar with the numbers. They attributed the performance to tight cost controls and the operational independence that was once a source of pride for  Wells Fargo. But that business model has come under scrutiny after revelations that thousands of branch employees created as many as 2.1 million accounts to hit aggressive sales targets. Following an internal investigation, Wells Fargo's directors released a report in April recommending tighter and more centralized risk management. Since then, Wells has begun moving 5,200 risk employees from business units to one  corporate risk  division. Although the changes could make businesses less nimble, tighter controls were inevitable, said Marty Mosby, analyst at Vining Sparks.  It was hard for them to give up that last piece of who they really were,  he said.  That's what made them more profitable than the other bank.

The bulk of the rules are being implemented, but final elements are gridlocked by disagreement.

DNB is benefiting from Norway's healthy economy, with lower unemployment in all regions, even areas where the crisis-hit energy sector is predominant. Net profit rose 15 percent to 5.24 billion crowns ($633.39 million), while analysts polled by Reuters had expected flat earnings.  There is profitable growth in all customer segments, and our customers make sure that we have lots to do across the board,  Chief Executive Rune Bjerke said in a statement.  Combined with low impairment losses during the quarter, this makes us satisfied,  he said. DNB's lending losses amounted to 597 million crowns, well below the 1.31 billion forecast by 16 analysts polled.  Those who were laid off in the oil and gas sector have been absorbed in other sectors. It has happened effectively and it has been happening fast,  Bjerke told Reuters. Its crown currency has weakened by some 30 percent against the euro in the past five years, strengthening the competitiveness of Norway's exports including aluminium and fertilisers. Rising public sector spending, underpinned by Norway's $855-billion sovereign wealth fund, has also supported demand and consumption.  I am quite positive,  said Bjerke.  We speak to our customers a lot and a majority of them are positive and see better results, and they are positive about the employment situation in their own companies.  The bank announced a share buy-back plan and said it would maintain its plan to pay more than half of its 2017 earnings in dividend. It also reiterated its 2016-2018 outlook for loan losses of up to 18 billion crowns by 2018. Those losses have reached 8.6 billion crowns.

Support for Abe has plummeted to its lowest since he surged back to power in 2012 with a conservative agenda of reviving traditional values and loosening constraints on the military that centers on revising the U.S.-drafted post-war constitution. In May, Abe made a surprise proposal to revise the charter's war-renouncing Article 9 by 2020 to clarify the ambiguous status of its military, known as the Self-Defense Forces, by 2020.  Meeting that deadline would mean adopting an amendment in parliament next year, since pro-revision forces in the lower house are likely to lose their super-majority in an election that must be held by late 2018. Amendments need the approval of two-thirds of both chambers and a majority in a referendum.  There is no change in the goal toward which we are working  but greater efforts are needed now to achieve that goal,  Hajime Funada, deputy head of a ruling Liberal Democratic Party task force on constitutional reform, told Reuters in an interview.   Rather than a matter of 'yes' or 'no' toward revising Article 9 itself, trust and expectations toward Prime Minister Abe, who is advocating it, have fallen sharply,  Funada said, adding that the LDP's junior coalition partner, the Komeito party, had also grown more cautious about amending the charter. Amending Article 9, which renounces the right to wage war as a way to settle international disputes, is a divisive issue in Japan. Supporters of the article see it as the foundation of post-war democracy but many conservatives see it as a humiliation,  imposed after defeat in World War Two.  Amending the article would also raise concern in China and South Korea, where bitter memories of the conflict run deep. 'In a Bind' Abe's proposal would be to retain the two clauses of Article 9 that renounce the right to wage war and ban maintenance of air, land and sea forces, while adding a clause legitimizing the SDF.  The impact of that change is hotly debated. Proponents say it would merely inscribe existing policies in the constitution, while critics worry it would open the door to a bigger role for the military overseas. Abe's popularity has been battered by suspicions of scandal over favoritism for a friend's business and by the perception among many voters that he and his aides have grown arrogant. The prime minister is set to reshuffle his cabinet next month to try to revive his sagging support, but Funada said the impact of personnel changes would probably be limited.  Unless he changes his attitude and his mindset, things will not improve,  Funada said. The appearance that Abe is hurrying to amend the constitution while he himself is in office was making the party task force's job harder, Funada said.  Abe is keen to achieve his goal in part because it eluded his grandfather, a conservative who had to resign as prime minister in 1960 due to a public furor over a U.S.-Japan security pact. Until recently, Abe was favored to win a third three-year term as LDP leader, and hence premier, when his current term expires in September 2018, but that has become less certain.  His feeling of wanting to try to revise the constitution while premier and if possible, succeed, is taking precedence and that has begun to be obvious,  Funada said.   We're in a bind.

The 2011 Fukushima disaster in Japan prompted Germany to pull out of nuclear power faster than planned, aiming to reduce to zero its 21,500 MW reactor capacity by 2022 deadline. Capacity has so far been reduced to 11,357 MW.  We intend to at least halve the number of positions until 2026,  a PreussenElektra spokesman said, confirming an earlier newspaper report and citing the phasing out of plants and the dismantling of already idled installations. The move is not related to previously announced E.ON plans to reduce group headcount by 1,300 by 2018 as stagnant demand and expanded renewables capacity erode the profitability of traditional thermal power stations. PreussenElektra operates three nuclear power stations in Germany -- Brokdorf, Isar 2 and Grohnde, which stayed with E.ON while other conventional energy plants were spun off into Uniper. Based in Hanover, PreussenElektra has already shut down five nuclear reactors, in line with Germany's nuclear exit plan. How the job cuts will be achieved remains subject to negotiations that have been stalled without dates for further talks being set, the spokesman said. E.ON offshoot Uniper, meanwhile, is to resume talks with employee representatives on Aug. 16 over plans to reduce personnel costs by 100 million euros ($114.5 million) this year and next, a Uniper spokeswoman said.

Our production has turned out to be better than predicted,  the country's Director General of Oil and Gas, Wiratmaja Puja, told reporters on Wednesday.  So there's a high possibility we won't need to import in 2019.  Puja was referring to higher-than-expected output from the Jangkrik gas field operated by Eni. The field was designed to produce 450 million cubic feet per day of gas but output could be up to 600 million cubic feet per day, he said. Currently the world's fifth-biggest exporter of LNG, Indonesia has lost market share to new production from Australia and Qatar and as output is reserved for domestic needs. However, the domestic gas market has not developed as anticipated even after the government promoted the fuel to replace coal for power plants and as an industrial fuel. Power plant developers in Indonesia are still relying on cheaper coal, however, which has curtailed the development of gas infrastructure. [reut.rs/2tM1Ade]  Puja also called into question imports after 2020 when he mentioned BP's Tangguh Train 3 project will supply more gas to Indonesia from 2020 onwards.  At the end of 2020 we won't need to import,  he added. The comments come even as Australia's Woodside Petroleum inked a contract in April to supply Indonesia's state-owned energy company Pertamina with LNG from 2019 to 2034. Pertamina also has a LNG import deal with U.S.-based Cheniere Energy Inc from 2018 and Exxon Mobil Corp from 2025. Puja suggested those supplies could be redirected to other LNG buyers in Asia, particularly Bangladesh.  We are pushing Pertamina to go global,  he said. When contacted by Reuters, Pertamina's Vice President for LNG, Didik Sasongko, supported that idea.   We can use it for trading or to optimise Pertamina's LNG portfolio,  Sasongko said, referring to the Cheniere deal.  There's flexibility on delivery,  he said when asked about the Woodside imports. Meanwhile, Puja said that Indonesia is looking for buyers for 16 to 18 uncommitted LNG cargoes for this year. He expects an average of 50 to 60 uncommitted cargoes per year until 2035.

Beijing has tightened the screws on financial risks due to an explosive growth in debt but has injected substantial liquidity at times to avoid a crunch and maintain stability. The stronger-than-expected loans suggest authorities are keeping up support for the real economy, even as they tighten regulations to force banks to deleverage, said Nie Wen, an economist at Hwabao Trust in Shanghai.  The shadow banking sector is shrinking but credit for the real economy remains strong,  he said.  Chinese banks extended 1.54 trillion yuan ($226.9 billion) in net new yuan loans in June, well above analysts' expectations of 1.2 trillion yuan, up from 1.11 trillion in May. Household loans, mostly mortgages, rose to 738.4 billion yuan in June from 610.6 billion yuan in May, according to Reuters calculations based on the central bank's data. Household loans accounted for 48 percent of total new loans last month, down from 55 percent in May. Broad M2 money supply, which includes demand deposits and monies held in easily accessible accounts, grew 9.4 percent in June from a year earlier, slowing from 9.6 percent in May, data showed. Economists expected 9.5 percent growth. The slower M2 growth, the central bank said last month, could be a  new normal  after May's reading fell to the slowest since records began in 1996, with analysts saying Beijing is having some success with financial deleveraging. Deleveraging Drive Growth in outstanding yuan loans was flat at 12.9 percent by month-end, although faster than forecasts of 12.7 percent. Total social financing, a broad measure of credit and liquidity in the economy, rose to 1.78 trillion yuan in June from 1.06 trillion yuan in May, the data showed. The effects of the government's multi-pronged crackdown are showing up in weakened off-balance sheet financing, or shadow banking activity. Combined trust loans, entrusted loans and undiscounted banker's acceptances, which are common forms of shadow banking activity, dipped to 428.8 billion yuan in the second quarter from 2.05 trillion yuan in the first quarter, according to Reuters calculations. Some analysts said the pick-up in new loans may be masking a slowdown in overall credit growth.  While we think the PBOC is now done pushing up interest rates, we expect the monetary tightening that has already taken place to continue weighing on credit growth from some time,  Julian Evans-Pritchard, China Economist, Capital Economics said in a report. Policy insiders say China's central bank will hold off on further monetary policy tightening and could even slightly loosen its grip in coming months as a deleveraging drive threatens economic growth and job creation ahead of a leadership reshuffle The PBOC has reiterated that it would continue to implement a prudent and neutral monetary policy, and keep liquidity in the country's financial system basically stable in its quarterly monetary policy committee meeting. China's banks extended a record 12.65 trillion yuan in loans in 2016 as the government encouraged credit-fueled stimulus to meet its economic growth target. The credit explosion has stoked worries about financial risks from a rapid build-up in debt, which authorities have pledged to contain this year.

In a securities filing late on Tuesday, Petrobras said the watchdog's board scrapped an earlier internal ruling asking for the restatement of results from the second and third quarters of 2013, and to the years of 2014, 2015 and 2016 to account for impairments related to certain hedging transactions. Petrobras announced changes in the accounting of so-called currency hedging in July 2013 to limit the impact of a weakening Brazilian real on debt. Petrobras is the world's most indebted major oil firm because of government-mandated investments that over-streched the company's balance sheet. The CVM's technical analysis department had recommended a revamping of such accounting practices and the restatement of results on March 8. That same day, Petrobras Chief Financial Officer Ivan Monteiro vowed to appeal the decision and keep hedge accounting practices unaltered.  The regulator's board decision confirms our understanding that the practice of hedge accounting can therefore be applied,  the filing said. The hedge mechanism forces Petrobras to set aside about 20 percent of export proceeds in a special account for seven years. Rather than accounting for them as revenue, the values in the account accrue to shareholders' equity. The system helps protect more than half Petrobras's net debt from foreign exchange-rate variations. The real's 35 percent decline against the dollar over the past four years led to a sharp rise in the company's foreign liabilities and debt payments, when denominated in local currency terms. Normally a decline in the currency against the dollar would require a company with dollar-denominated debts to record a non-cash, non-operational impairment on results, reducing net profit or increasing a net loss.

While the Federal Reserve chair is expected to say that the Fed still intends to steadily raise rates, any signals on how the bank is viewing a retreat in inflation and muted wage growth will be closely watched. Comments overnight from two of her colleagues calling for caution on further interest rate rises have pushed back the probability of a hike again before the end of the year to 50 percent, according to the CME's Fed watch data.  The Yellen testimony remains the key event risk in today's session but we remain optimistic about the dollar's outlook, and putting on a long position against the sterling is the best way to execute that view,  said Adam Cole, head of FX strategy at RBC Capital Markets in London. Sterling hit a two-week low against the dollar and deepened a fall to its lowest in eight months against the euro on Wednesday after Bank of England Deputy Governor Ben Broadbent said he was not yet ready to raise interest rates. The fall in sterling once again lifted the exporter heavy UK bluechip index which rose 1 percent, outperforming regional peers. European shares rose 0.8 percent with all major sectors in the green. Stock futures on Wall Street were up 0.1 percent. U.S. stocks took a brief tumble during Tuesday trading on Wall Street after emails disclosed President Donald Trump's eldest son welcomed help from a Russian lawyer for his father's 2016 election campaign against Hillary Clinton. But by the closing bell, Wall Street shares had clawed back their losses. The dollar, however, failed to recover after the damage suffered from the new twist in the Trump campaign's alleged links with Russia. The greenback was trading flat against a basket of major currencies and was hovering near its lowest since last May against the euro. Investors were also bracing for a move on interests at the Bank of Canada. A Reuters poll forecast the bank to raise interest rates later in the day, which would be the first hike in seven years. Goldman Sachs economists expect the bank to stand pat, citing in-line economic data and weak inflation. In commodity markets, oil prices got a reprieve from worries about oversupply after the U.S. government cut its crude production outlook for next year and as fuel inventories plunged.

The groups have argued the UNESCO designation would allow Chinese authorities to remove residents from the area, known as Hoh Xil, in Qinghai province, and threaten its environment and nomadic culture. The ministry, in a statement sent to Reuters, said the awarding of world heritage status by the U.N. cultural organization last week represented the international community's  full approval  of the government's success at protecting Hoh Xil's environment. The government's application documents for the status for the site showed its resolve to fully respect the wishes, traditional culture, religious beliefs and lifestyles of the nomadic people who live there, the ministry said.  The Chinese government has not, is not and will not in the future do any forced evictions in the Hoh Xil nominated area,  it said. Qinghai government regulations and plans also include no requirements for forced relations, the ministry said. The area has an elevation of more than 4,500 meters (14,764 feet) and is home to several endemic animal species as well as the entire migratory route of the endangered Tibetan antelope. Tibetan rights groups argue the UNESCO designation could accelerate Chinese efforts to move nomads into settled villages. China routinely rejects criticism from rights groups and exiles who accuse it of trampling on the religious and cultural rights of the Tibetan people, saying its rule has brought prosperity to a once-backward region. Aside from what China calls the Tibet Autonomous Region, there are also large Tibetan communities in neighboring provinces of Qinghai, Gansu, Sichuan and Yunnan.

Grain traders have struggled with rising competition in Russia, one of the world's largest wheat exporters, in recent years, while their trading margins have also been squeezed.     Bunge's move highlights rising competition in deep-water ports in Russia's part of the Black Sea, from which traders supply grain by large ships to customers such as Egypt, the world's largest wheat importer.  The shallow-water ports of the Azov Sea usually supply grain by smaller ships to customers like Turkey.  Concentrating operations on a company-owned shallow water port terminal could give the advantage of low costs for niche business,  one trader said. Bunge is the  B  of the so-called ABCDs of global grain trading, which also include rivals Archer Daniels Midland Co, Cargill Inc and Louis Dreyfus Co.  Bunge is re-focusing and consolidating its Russian grain origination activities in Rostov-on-Don, where we have an export terminal, helping us achieve greater efficiencies,  Bunge spokeswoman Susan Burns said. Bunge has already closed offices in Russia's Black Sea port of Novorossiisk and in Yeisk. It will also close the office in Stavropol this autumn, while its office in Voronezh will remain open for seeds origination, but not for grain purchases.  Russia will remain an important origin for Bunge, and we remain committed to having an asset footprint,  Burns said. Bunge, which also has a sunflower oil plant in Russia and a grain terminal in Ukraine, was Russia's 14th largest grain exporter in the 2016/17 marketing year, which ended on June 30, with a 2 percent share, or 723,000 tonnes, the state Grain Quality Service said. The bulk of Bunge's supplies go through shallow-water ports.   To make money in the increasingly competitive Russian export sector you need a critical mass of high volume business. It is thought that Bunge's deep-sea exports have been too small a volume in recent years,  a German trader said.  It looks like overhead costs are being reduced and more niche business will be developed,  the trader added.

As investors sought to take profits after a recent dollar rally on the back of a broadly mixed session for risky assets, the greenback's rise was also halted thanks to a softening of U.S. Treasury yields this week. The dollar edged 0.4 percent lower against the yen to 113.43 in early trades after rising more than 5 percent over the last month. It was trading at 1.14565 against the euro, its lowest level since early May.  The Yellen testimony remains the key event risk in today's session but we remain optimistic about the dollar's outlook and putting on a long position against sterling is the best way to execute that view,  said Adam Cole, head of FX strategy at RBC Capital Markets in London. Yellen will give her semi-annual monetary policy testimony before Congress later on Wednesday and on Thursday, and investors will be parsing it for clues on when the Fed will start reducing its massive balance sheet. Strategists at Brown Brothers Harriman don't expect Yellen to break new ground in her testimony. The Fed raised rates last month to a range of 1 percent to 1.25 percent and market expectations are roughly of a 50 percent probability that interest rates will rise again before the end of the year, according to the CME's Fed watch data. Uk Prospects While there is a 50 percent probability for the Bank of England to raise interest rates too before the end of the year, markets are expecting the central bank to strike a dovish stance after recent soft data and comments from policymakers. In an interview for a Scottish newspaper, the Press and Journal, published on Wednesday, Bank of England Deputy Governor Ben Broadbent said that while there was reason to see the bank moving towards higher rates, there were  a lot of imponderables . His comments pushed sterling to a two-week low against the dollar and to its lowest in eight months against the euro in early trading on Wednesday. While subsequent wages data pulled sterling from the day's lows, the outlook remained wary. In other currencies, the Canadian dollar was slightly higher against its U.S. counterpart as investors awaited a Bank of Canada interest rate decision later on Wednesday.

The 2011 Fukushima disaster in Japan prompted Germany to pull out of nuclear power faster than planned, aiming to reduce to zero its 21,500 MW reactor capacity by 2022 deadline. Capacity has so far been reduced to 11,357 MW.  We intend to at least halve the number of positions until 2026,  a PreussenElektra spokesman said, confirming an earlier newspaper report and citing the phasing out of plants and the dismantling of already idled installations. The move is not related to previously announced E.ON plans to reduce group headcount by 1,300 by 2018 as stagnant demand and expanded renewables capacity erode the profitability of traditional thermal power stations. PreussenElektra operates three nuclear power stations in Germany -- Brokdorf, Isar 2 and Grohnde, which stayed with E.ON while other conventional energy plants were spun off into Uniper. Based in Hanover, PreussenElektra has already shut down five nuclear reactors, in line with Germany's nuclear exit plan. How the job cuts will be achieved remains subject to negotiations that have been stalled without dates for further talks being set, the spokesman said.

The rating reflects Evex's leading market position in the Georgian healthcare market and its defensive revenues, which primarily come from state-funded healthcare programmes. This payor structure leads to long-term risks being correlated with the sovereign risk and with economic development in Georgia (BB-/Stable). The rating, however, is constrained by execution risks related to the company's ambitious investment strategy and its adherence to a conservative balance-sheet policy. The Positive Outlook reflects our expectation that the company's credit metrics will improve over 2017-2018 following finalisation of its sizeable capex programme and ramp-up of two newly renovated hospitals. This together with reduced execution risks and stronger free cash flow (FCF) generation could lead to a credit profile more consistent with a 'BB-' rating over the next 18 months. KEY RATING DRIVERS Largest Healthcare Provider in Georgia: The rating reflects Evex's strong market position as the largest healthcare provider in Georgia operating a network of hospitals and ambulatory clinics. Its business profile benefits from an established position with a 25% market share by number of beds as of April 2017, greater scale than its local competitors, the well-invested healthcare facilities in the country, and a good value proposition. This balances the company's small scale (2016 EBITDAR: USD35 million) compared with its international peers. Government Reimbursements Key Revenue Source: More than 70% of Evex's revenues stem from government reimbursements under state healthcare programmes and we expect no changes in payor mix over the medium term. High dependence on government reimbursement links Evex's revenues to state healthcare spending and ultimately to the country's GDP. Taking into account the positive outlook for government healthcare spending in Georgia, the ability of healthcare providers to set their own prices and the smooth reimbursement mechanism, we view reliance on government-funded healthcare programmes as positive for Evex's credit profile. Favourable Market Fundamentals: Fitch believes Evex's strong market position places the company well to benefit not only from market growth but also from its consolidation, as the market remains highly fragmented. Private healthcare is a relatively young industry in Georgia and operates under an evolving regulatory environment. We expect the sector to grow in the low teens over the medium term due to increasing demand and government healthcare spending. High Capex to Fall: Evex's financial profile has been impacted by continuing high capex as the company is renovating and upgrading its recently acquired hospitals, developing the network of ambulatory clinics and widening its service offer. We expect capex to be at around 30% of revenue in 2017, then falling to below 10% in 2018-2020 as the investment cycle completes. The rating assumes that these investments will be fully funded by operating cash flows and a portion of proceeds from a planned placement of a new five-year GEL90 million bond. Deleveraging Subject to Business Expansion: We expect Evex to improve its FFO fixed charge cover to around 5x (2016: 3.6x) and reduce FFO adjusted leverage to below 2x by 2020 (2016: 3.3x), which is the lowest among Fitch-rated industry peers. However, the rating incorporates execution risks as projected deleveraging is conditional upon more than 50% growth in Evex's 2016 EBITDA by 2020 (2016: GEL80 million), driven by ramping up volume and quality of services, something we feel is achievable under our forecasts in line with positive sector trends in Georgia. Strong EBITDA Margin: Evex has the highest EBITDA margin (2016: 33%) among Fitch-rated healthcare providers. There is a potential for further profitability improvement due to increasing capacity utilisation, centralisation of support functions as well as from growing contribution from ambulatory clinics segment that enjoys higher margins. However, we conservatively assume flat EBITDA margin at around 30% over 2017-2020, which is aligned with the management guidance. Reduced FX Risks: Evex has converted its US dollar loans from development banks (43% of debt at end-June 2017) into Georgian lari in 2017. As a result, its exposure to FX risks has fallen substantially as now more than 70% of Evex's debt is denominated in Georgian lari, matching the currency of its operating cash flows. Ring-Fenced Entity from GHG: The rating and the positive outlook assume that Evex remains ring-fenced from its parent Georgia Healthcare Group PLC (GHG) and sister companies as established in the agreements on long-dated loans from development banks. Any material loosening of the current arrangements, including any larger-than-expected upstreaming of dividends and/ or cash deployed for other GHG activities might be considered a negative rating event. DERIVATION SUMMARY Evex is smaller than its international peers, such as Fresenius Medical Care AG & Co. KGaA (BBB-/Stable), Universal Health Services, Inc. (BB+/Stable) and LifePoint Health, Inc. (BB/Stable), as it operates only in Georgia, which has a small economy. Nevertheless, the company's business profile is supported by Evex's leading market position, wide market share gap with its closest competitor, lack of visible threat from international players entering the market, and good growth opportunities. Evex's financial profile benefits from higher profit margins and a more conservative capital structure than industry peers. Evex's high dependence on government reimbursements links its revenues to state healthcare spending and ultimately to the sovereign risks of Georgia (BB-/ Stable). The rating, however, is constrained by execution risks related to the company's ambitious investment strategy. No Country Ceiling constraint or operating environment influence was in effect for these ratings. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: -no reduction in government healthcare spending or adverse change in industry regulation; -double-digit revenue growth over 2017-2019 supported by ramp-up of renovated hospitals and increasing utilisation of other hospitals and low single-digit price increases; -EBITDA margin around 30%; -stable working-capital turnover; -no dividends until 2019, 40% payout thereafter; -no material debt-funded M&A; or cash support to GHG or sister companies. RATING SENSITIVITIES Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action - Ramp-up of renovated hospitals and growth of existing business in line with business plan - EBITDA margin around 28%-30% - Evidence of FFO adjusted leverage decreasing towards 2x on a sustained basis - Free cash flow turning and remaining positive Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Rating Downgrade - Reduction in government healthcare spending or regulatory action leading towards increasing revenue volatility or a reduction of profitability and cash-flow generation - FFO adjusted leverage increasing up to 3.5x on a sustained basis due to, for instance, weak operating performance or a more aggressive financial policy - FFO fixed charge coverage sustainably below 2.0x - Material debt-funded M&A; by Evex or its parent GHG if funded by Evex Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Revision of the Outlook to Stable - FFO adjusted leverage sustainably at 2.5x-3.0x due to slower-than-expected EBITDA growth or more aggressive financial policy - Adverse changes in regulatory environment LIQUIDITY New Bond to Strengthen Liquidity: At end-June 2017 available cash of GEL12.6 million was insufficient to cover GEL25.5 million in short-term debt and expected negative FCF. The company did not have any undrawn committed credit lines at end-June 2017. However, liquidity should be strengthened by issuance of local five-year GEL90 million bond. Proceeds will be applied to refinance certain loans from local banks and fund capex, which is partly scalable and is the major driver behind negative FCF.

Beijing has tightened the screws on financial risks due to an explosive growth in debt but has injected substantial liquidity at times to avoid a crunch and maintain stability. The stronger-than-expected loans suggest authorities are keeping up support for the real economy, even as they tighten regulations to force banks to deleverage, said Nie Wen, an economist at Hwabao Trust in Shanghai.  The shadow banking sector is shrinking but credit for the real economy remains strong,  he said.  Chinese banks extended 1.54 trillion yuan ($226.9 billion) in net new yuan loans in June, well above analysts' expectations of 1.2 trillion yuan, up from 1.11 trillion in May. Household loans, mostly mortgages, rose to 738.4 billion yuan in June from 610.6 billion yuan in May, according to Reuters calculations based on the central bank's data. Household loans accounted for 48 percent of total new loans last month, down from 55 percent in May. Broad M2 money supply, which includes demand deposits and monies held in easily accessible accounts, grew 9.4 percent in June from a year earlier, slowing from 9.6 percent in May, data showed. Economists expected 9.5 percent growth. The slower M2 growth, the central bank said last month, could be a  new normal  after May's reading fell to the slowest since records began in 1996, with analysts saying Beijing is having some success with financial deleveraging. Deleveraging Drive Growth in outstanding yuan loans was flat at 12.9 percent by month-end, although faster than forecasts of 12.7 percent. Total social financing, a broad measure of credit and liquidity in the economy, rose to 1.78 trillion yuan in June from 1.06 trillion yuan in May, the data showed. The effects of the government's multi-pronged crackdown are showing up in weakened off-balance sheet financing, or shadow banking activity. Combined trust loans, entrusted loans and undiscounted banker's acceptances, which are common forms of shadow banking activity, dipped to 428.8 billion yuan in the second quarter from 2.05 trillion yuan in the first quarter, according to Reuters calculations. Some analysts said the pick-up in new loans may be masking a slowdown in overall credit growth.  While we think the PBOC is now done pushing up interest rates, we expect the monetary tightening that has already taken place to continue weighing on credit growth from some time,  Julian Evans-Pritchard, China Economist, Capital Economics said in a report. Policy insiders say China's central bank will hold off on further monetary policy tightening and could even slightly loosen its grip in coming months as a deleveraging drive threatens economic growth and job creation ahead of a leadership reshuffle The PBOC has reiterated that it would continue to implement a prudent and neutral monetary policy, and keep liquidity in the country's financial system basically stable in its quarterly monetary policy committee meeting. China's banks extended a record 12.65 trillion yuan in loans in 2016 as the government encouraged credit-fueled stimulus to meet its economic growth target. The credit explosion has stoked worries about financial risks from a rapid build-up in debt, which authorities have pledged to contain this year.

Support for Abe has plunged to its lowest since the prime minister returned to office in December 2012 with a promise to revive Japan's stale economy and bolster its defenses, opinion polls showed this week. In a bid to turn the tide, Abe is considering a wholesale shakeup of his cabinet on Aug 3, replacing more than half of his 19 ministers, while retaining key ally Chief Cabinet Minister Yoshihide Suga and Finance Minister Taro Aso, Kyodo news agency said, quoting unidentified sources close to the matter. It was not certain that the 59-year-old Kishida would refuse to stay on if Abe pressed him to do so, Kyodo added, however, quoting his aides. Reuters could not immediately reach Kishida's political aides for comment.  Kishida's exit from the cabinet would signal his desire to replace Abe and reinforce perceptions that Abe is on the ropes,  said Jeffrey Kingston, director of Asian studies at Temple University's Japan campus.  Abe's slump in popularity followed a historic defeat for his Liberal Democratic Party in a July 2 election for the Tokyo Metropolitan assembly at the hands of a novice party led by the capital's popular governor, Yuriko Koike. Japan’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Fumio Kishida speaks during a Security Council meeting on the situation in North Korea at the United Nations (UN) in New York, U.S., April 28, 2017.Lucas JacksonAbe's ratings fell 13 points to 36 percent in a survey by the conservative Yomiuri newspaper and 5 points to 33 percent in a poll by the liberal Asahi newspaper. Defence Minister Tomomi Inada and Justice Minister Katsutoshi Kaneda are expected to be replaced in the reshuffle after a series of missteps widely seen as contributing to the fall in support and the election defeat. The election loss was a stinging rebuke to Abe's administration, battered by suspicions of scandal over favoritism for a friend's business and by the perception among many voters that he and his close aides have grown arrogant. Abe has benefited until now from a weak opposition, super-majorities in both houses of parliament, and a shortage of challengers inside his party. Just a few months ago, he had been considered likely to win a third three-year term as LDP president in a September 2018 party poll, setting him on course to become Japan's longest-serving leader. But falling ratings have spurred potential rivals such as Kishida, considered less hawkish than Abe, to gear up for possible challenges, political insiders and experts say.

The Philippines suspended exploration at the Reed Bank, which it calls Recto Bank, in late 2014, as it pursued international arbitration over territorial disputes. The bank is in waters claimed by China. Ismael Ocampo, director at the Department of Energy's Resource Development Bureau, told reporters the agency expected the suspension to be lifted in December. He said a directive from the Department of Foreign Affairs directing the Department of Energy to resume oil and gas exploration in the South China Sea was already in the works. China claims almost the entire South China Sea, where about $5 trillion worth of sea-borne goods pass every year. Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Vietnam and Taiwan also have claims. Exactly a year ago, the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague invalidated China's claim to sovereignty over most of the South China Sea. The ruling, which China refused to recognize, clarified Philippine sovereign rights in its 200-mile Exclusive Economic Zone to access offshore oil and gas fields, including the Reed Bank, 85 nautical miles off its coast.  We will try to conduct seismic activities,  in the disputed waters, Ocampo said, hopeful that China would not complain and harass crews of survey ships to be deployed.  In 2011, Chinese patrol vessels almost rammed a survey ship at the Reed Bank contracted by a PXP Energy Corp (PXP.PS) unit. President Rodrigo Duterte, who took power shortly before the Hague ruled in favor of Manila, has said he would raise the landmark ruling with China eventually, but he first needed to strengthen relations between the two countries. Duterte, who has been cool toward old ally the United States, hopes closer ties with China will yield billions of dollars in loans and investment in infrastructure, the backbone of his economic agenda. PXP Energy Chairman Manuel Pangilinan said in March he was optimistic his company's exploration project at Reed Bank would soon resume, citing the warming ties with China. The Philippines, which relies overwhelmingly on imports to fuel its fast-growing economy, is under pressure to develop indigenous energy resources. Its main source of natural gas, the Malampaya field near the disputed waters, is due to run out in less a decade. PXP's Reed Bank prospect has indicated natural gas yield potential. More than two dozen oil, gas and coal blocks, including additional areas in disputed waters, may be offered during the December bidding, Ocampo said.

That commitment is now being put to the test in one of the company's most important international projects: building a low-cost car for India. Mueller said in March he was giving the job to the group's Czech brand Skoda, which is now leading partnership talks with India's Tata Motors (TAMO.NS). Skoda has been authorized to take  incremental  decisions, while keeping Wolfsburg informed, a source at the brand said.  The move, the first major international project led by Skoda since Volkswagen (VW) took full control of it in 2000, is a sign of how the different divisions and regions within the 12-brand VW (VOWG_p.DE) empire are gaining influence, the source added.  Mueller's nine-member management team has also started to hold regular meetings outside of its northern German home, with the first one abroad held in Shanghai in April.  Sharing out power is important because many people both inside and outside VW believe the company's traditional authoritarian management structure created the environment that led to engineers installing illegal software to cheat diesel emissions tests in millions of cars worldwide.  With staff focused on meeting targets set by remote bosses and too fearful to highlight problems, VW was plunged into the biggest business crisis in its 80-year history when the cheating was exposed in September 2015 - a crisis that has so far cost it more than $25 billion in fines, compensation and vehicle refits.  Some VW investors say there were other causes of the crisis - in particular that the company was not open enough to outside scrutiny. They want it to appoint more independent directors to oversee executives, and hire more managers from outside the group, rather than filling top jobs with company veterans.   So far Mueller, who has been at VW for 40 years and became CEO a week after the emissions scandal erupted, has rejected calls to overhaul its supervisory and management boards. VW has also not, as originally promised, published the report it commissioned from a U.S. law firm into the emissions scandal, saying there are no written findings and it is unable to do so under the terms of a settlement with U.S. authorities.   But Mueller's decentralization drive may help to win over some investors - particularly if it boosts financial results.  The Rewards of Change Analysts say Wolfsburg's grip over the world's biggest carmaker has been responsible for some of its failings in key markets. These include the United States, where VW has struggled to adapt to local tastes, and also building a budget car for emerging markets, where Wolfsburg engineers steeped in technical excellence missed cost targets, VW sources have said. VW's low-cost Lupo model was dropped from production after less than a decade due to weak demand worldwide, while a small car partnership with Suzuki Motor Corp. (7269.T) collapsed.  Skoda, which built cheap runabouts during the Czech Republic's Communist era, is studying whether it can adapt a low-cost production platform developed by Tata Motors, the Skoda source said. The firms are also looking at potential joint development of components, he added. A Tata Motors spokesperson said the companies were  evaluating the potential cooperation,  without elaborating.      If it can succeed, a budget car for India would tap into a lucrative part of one of the world's fastest growing auto markets, and would be a big boost in VW's battle for global industry leadership with Japan's Toyota (7203.T). But it's early days, and the project won't be easy. Rival General Motors (GM) (GM.N) has decided to stop selling cars altogether in India due to cut-throat competition. There are also question marks over whether VW has entirely cast off its old centralizing habits.  For example, when the company's factory in Tennessee had problems ramping up production of its new U.S. SUV, the Atlas, Wolfsburg vetoed a contract extension for the head of the plant, according to one VW source. VW last month said only that he was returning to Germany after completing his assignment. The biggest brake on Mueller's decentralization drive may come from VW's home state of Lower Saxony and powerful labor unions, which together dominate the supervisory board that decides on plant closures, asset sales and executive posts.  Home to six VW plants with over 100,000 workers, Lower Saxony has the most to lose from a dispersal of power to VW's regions. Its leadership supports Mueller's reforms, but with reservations, saying employees should be involved and changes should not be implemented in a top-down way.   A culture change can only succeed together with all participants,  Lower Saxony prime minister Stephan Weil told Reuters.  An assortment of Volkswagen Passat vehicles sit for sale at a Volkswagen dealership in San Diego, California, September 21, 2015.Mike BlakeTaking Responsibility Many of Mueller's reforms are aimed at engaging and empowering staff, while breaking down barriers with executives.  Some changes have been symbolic, such as selling VW's corporate Airbus jet or opening up the executive dining room at Wolfsburg to factory workers; others, more fundamental, such as empowering senior engineers to control budgets and deadlines, according to company sources. Mueller is also reducing the number of the group's corporate committees by a third, and staff have noticed a difference.  Before the crisis, top management was aloof,  said an employee who has worked in administration at Wolfsburg for 15 years.  Now there is a refreshing sense of normality.   To encourage innovation and risk-taking, VW is considering raising the pay of its 20,000 managers worldwide, said group human resources boss Karlheinz Blessing. Blessing himself is trying to lead the change in culture by shunning the executive car park and riding a bicycle on factory grounds.  We encourage people to take responsibility,  he said in an interview.  But that will take time. First there needs to be confidence that you won't be raked over the coals if you make a wrong decision.   Slideshow (4 Images)There are hopes this more hands-off management style will also improve company performance. Elmar-Marius Licharz, one of four new model-line chiefs at the VW brand, said designers and engineers working on the VW Golf 2019 model were about two months ahead of target, suggesting the pace of product development had picked up with fewer top managers intervening in the process.   Involving the CEO in development of each model creates a lot of time limitations,  he said.   It's all about collaboration and self-reliance now.  Herculean Task For all Mueller's reforms within VW, however, corporate governance experts say there has not been enough progress in opening up the company to outside scrutiny. The executive hired for a newly created management board position for integrity and legal affairs quit in January after only a year in the job, with VW citing unspecified differences with management. A new appointment has been made.  That compares with GM which, after its own scandal over safety defects, appointed a vice president for vehicle safety and publicly stated that if there were any obstacles to solving a safety issue the executive  has the authority to clear them.  A labor union source said VW's compliance efforts were in their infancy, with only about 65 compliance officers and 25 or so integrity experts at a new unit responsible for the group's 620,000 workers. VW declined to comment.   That compares with the several hundred of compliance officers and experts that German industrial group Siemens has employed since a 2006 corruption scandal. For Christian Strenger, a supervisory board member at Deutsche Bank's (DBKGn.DE) retail asset management arm DWS, VW's reforms will fall short until it improves the oversight of top executives and brings in new leaders to replace the likes of Mueller and Chairman Hans-Dieter Poetsch, another VW veteran.  He has filed a lawsuit against VW's entire management and supervisory boards to try to reverse the 2016 appointments of Poetsch and three other supervisory board members. He wants them replaced with independent directors.   Without substantial changes, neither customers, investors, the public nor the media will be convinced by this cultural change,  Strenger, a former corporate governance adviser to the German government, told Reuters. There is no sign that VW's leadership, backed by the group's Porsche-Piech founding families which own a controlling stake in the business, is ready to comply.   We consider this lawsuit to be completely unfounded,  a VW spokesman in Wolfsburg said. So the battle over reform at VW looks set to rage on.   The cultural overhaul is a Herculean task and will take 10-15 years to materialise,  predicted Stefan Bratzel, head of the Center of Automotive Management think-tank near Cologne.

The one trillion tonne iceberg, measuring 5,800 square km, calved away from the Larsen C Ice Shelf in Antarctica sometime between July 10 and 12, said scientists at the University of Swansea and the British Antarctic Survey. The iceberg has been close to breaking off for a few months. Throughout the Antarctic winter, scientists monitored the progress of the rift in the ice shelf using the European Space Agency satellites.  The iceberg is one of the largest recorded and its future progress is difficult to predict,  said Adrian Luckman, professor at Swansea University and lead investigator of Project MIDAS, which has been monitoring the ice shelf for years.  It may remain in one piece but is more likely to break into fragments. Some of the ice may remain in the area for decades, while parts of the iceberg may drift north into warmer waters,  he added. The ice will add to risks for ships now it has broken off. The peninsula is outside major trade routes but the main destination for cruise ships visiting from South America. In 2009, more than 150 passengers and crew were evacuated after the MTV Explorer sank after striking an iceberg off the Antarctic peninsula. The iceberg, which is likely to be named A68, was already floating before it broke away so there is no immediate impact on sea levels, but the calving has left the Larsen C ice shelf reduced in area by more than 12 percent. The Larsen A and B ice shelves, which were situated further north on the Antarctic Peninsula, collapsed in 1995 and 2002, respectively.  This resulted in the dramatic acceleration of the glaciers behind them, with larger volumes of ice entering the ocean and contributing to sea-level rise,  said David Vaughan, glaciologist and director of science at British Antarctic Survey.  If Larsen C now starts to retreat significantly and eventually collapses, then we will see another contribution to sea level rise,  he added. Big icebergs break off Antarctica naturally, meaning scientists are not linking the rift to manmade climate change. The ice, however, is a part of the Antarctic peninsula that has warmed fast in recent decades.  In the ensuing months and years, the ice shelf could either gradually regrow, or may suffer further calving events which may eventually lead to collapse – opinions in the scientific community are divided,  Luckman said.  Our models say it will be less stable, but any future collapse remains years or decades away.  (Editing by Toby Chopra)","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/antarctica-iceberg-idUSL8N1K32DK"},

Paleeva, who finished 16th in the two-woman bobsleigh at the 2014 Sochi Olympics, had not provided sufficient information about her whereabouts to be reached by anti-doping control officers, according to the president of Russia's bobsleigh federation, two-time Olympic gold medalist Alexander Zubkov.   She did not cooperate with anti-doping organizations and did not provide the necessary information about herself in the ADAMS system,  TASS news agency quoted Zubkov as saying on Wednesday, referring to a database system used to monitor the testing of athletes.  Zubkov added that Paleeva had received several warnings ahead of the ban.

Russia last year was stripped of hosting the 2017 bobsleigh and skeleton world championships amid calls for a boycott in protest at doping in Russian sport.WADA last month allowed RUSADA to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts but has stressed that much remains to be done for the agency to retrieve its accreditation.

Narrowing the fiscal deficit supports Egypt's sovereign credit profile, but significantly reducing the public debt ratio is a multi-year task. Egypt's parliament last week passed the state budget for the 2017-18 fiscal year (FY18, starting 1 July). The government had earlier cut fuel subsidies in a move that will save around EGP35 billion (USD2 billion) compared with FY17, when subsidy spending increased owing to sharp currency depreciation. Fuel subsidy reform is a key element of Egypt's USD12 billion IMF programme. The government has also followed through on its plan for a fourth round of electricity subsidy reform, lowering the electricity subsidy bill to EGP30 billion, although it has extended the deadline for phasing out electricity subsidies to 2021 from 2019. Cutting energy subsidies at the beginning of the fiscal year gives us greater confidence in the authorities' willingness to control expenditure and hence in the credibility of fiscal targets. The FY18 budget aims to reduce the budget sector fiscal deficit to 9.1% of GDP (with a primary surplus of 0.3% of GDP), from an estimated 10.9% of GDP in FY17. Fitch's forecast of 9.3% (and a primary deficit of 0.3%) implies modest slippage against the target while maintaining deficit reduction. We think there is scope for stronger-than-budgeted revenues given high inflation and following the introduction of VAT last October. VAT should be a significant source of FY18 revenue due to an increase in the rate to 14%, the full-year effect, and improved administration of VAT on services. Our slightly wider forecast reflects the prospect of higher-than-budgeted spending. The government is increasing social spending, for example on food subsidies and pensions and a partial cost of living adjustment for government employees. Nevertheless, the wage bill is still only budgeted to increase by around 8% in FY18, which even with attrition from retirements would be significantly below the rate of inflation. We think there is some scope to offset higher spending by reducing capex, depending on how revenue performs. Public finances are a key weakness in Egypt's sovereign credit profile. We estimate that the general government debt/GDP ratio exceeded 100% at end-FY17 following the flotation of the Egyptian pound. We forecast a decline to 87.9% in FY19, but this is highly dependent on securing a small primary surplus and increasing economic growth. The FY18 budget projects GDP growth of 4.6%, broadly in line with Fitch's forecast. We think politics presents the key risk to consolidation, which stalled in FY16 around parliamentary elections. There may be a similar risk ahead of the presidential elections due by May 2018. Measures already legislated for (including civil service reform and the introduction of VAT), together with the IMF programme, provide a stronger policy anchor. But political sensitivity to the social impact of spending cuts and high inflation still presents implementation risk. Headline inflation was 29.8% yoy in June and is set to rise back above 30% following the energy price hikes. The central bank raised interest rates by 200bp for the second consecutive policy meeting on 6 July, with the aim of controlling inflation expectations. We affirmed Egypt's 'B'/Stable sovereign rating on 22 June. Egypt's sovereign credit profile was among the topics discussed at our Fitch on the Middle East and North Africa event in London on 6 July.

The bank has tasked Rothschild with advising it on options for its restructuring, which could include the sale of Deutsche Hypo as early as later this year, the people said, adding that no decisions have been taken so far. NordLB will only sell profitable Deutsche Hypo if the effect on the bank's capitalisation is large enough, they added.  All of the bank's units have been put under scrutiny,  a NordLB spokesman said, declining to elaborate further. Rothschild declined to comment. Property lenders such as Aareal and Deutsche Pfandbriefbank (PBB) are seen as potential bidders for Deutsche Hypo, as are public-sector banks including BerlinHyp and other banks and private equity investors. NordLB said in April it would not need to turn to its owners for extra capital to shoulder a record 2016 loss of 1.96 billion euros ($2.25 billion), caused by 2.94 billion euros in provisions for bad shipping loans. Germany was one of the world's main centres of global ship financing before the 2008 financial crisis, and the five German banks with the closest links to the shipping industry still have around 80 billion euros on loan to the sector. NordLB, as well as peers such as HSH, Commerzbank, DVB and KfW, have taken large writedowns and boosted capital buffers against the risk of shipping loans turning sour. Deutsche Hypo had a book value of 1.4 billion euros as of December 2016, according to a company presentation. Listed peers Aareal and PBB trade at 0.8 and 0.6 times their book value.

While Yellen is expected to say that the Fed remains on a hawkish course of steadily raising rates, any signals on how the bank is viewing a retreat in inflation and muted wage growth will be closely watched.     Philippine shares outperformed other markets in Southeast Asia, rising 1 percent to post their highest close in more than three weeks.     About 238,000 shares changed hands, the highest in nearly a month.     Real estate stocks led the gains with Ayala Land gaining 2.9 percent and SM Prime Holdings closing up 1.8 percent.      I think there's general optimism in the property market,  said Jeffrey Lucero, an equity research analyst with RCBC Securities.     The market may be pricing in a good results season since some companies such as Ayala Land met investors' expectations last quarter, he added.      Indonesian shares ended 0.8 percent higher, lifted by consumer and financial stocks, while an index of the country's 45 most liquid stocks gained 1 percent.     Vietnam shares rose 0.6 percent with oil and gas refiner Petrovietnam Gas Joint Stock Corp logging its biggest gain in more than three months.     Crude oil prices rose more than 1 percent, extending gains from the previous day as the U.S. government cut its crude production outlook for next year and as fuel inventories plunged.     Malaysian shares hit their lowest in more than two-and-a-half months before recovering to end marginally higher, while Thai stocks closed up 0.4 percent.      Meanwhile, Singapore shares closed down 0.3 percent after shedding as much as 0.7 percent to hit a six-week low earlier in the session.       The market has performed quite well in the first half, so people are taking profits,  said Joanne Goh, an equity strategist with DBS Bank Ltd.     Heavyweights DBS Group and Hongkong Land Holdings  declined about 0.8 percent each.         Companies are due to report their quarterly results, and there are expectations that some stocks, including banks, may disappoint, she added.       Banks are still uncertain as to whether there will be more provisions,  said Goh.  So far, the net interest margins haven't picked up despite interest rates going up.

Rothschild is in a strong position for an advisory role to the deal that could raise $1.5 to $2 billion for ADNOC, sources told Reuters.     Beyond the Gulf region, oil companies are looking to raise capital and boost valuations in an era of cheap oil from listings or sales of retail units. Plans to list some of ADNOC's services also come as other Gulf states, such as Saudi Arabia and Oman, have embarked on privatising energy assets. The listing of Abu Dhabi National Oil Co's (ADNOC) Distribution business, which manages petrol stations as well as convenience stores across the United Arab Emirates (UAE), is planned before the end of the year, one of the sources told Reuters. The company has a total number of 460 petrol stations after the opening up of several new ones since the start of the year, it said in a statement on Wednesday. ADNOC's listing could stir the UAE's lackluster IPO scene from its recent slumber. There have been only two initial public offerings (IPOs) so far in 2017 in the UAE, raising $348.5 million, and none at all last year, Thomson Reuters data shows. Other oil companies looking to raise money from listings of retail units include China Petroleum and Chemical Corp, which is planning to list its retail unit in Hong Kong and Thailand's biggest energy company PTT which is examining a proposal to list its retail business. The pitching process for the ADNOC deal is under way after the unlisted group announced this week that it is looking to float some of its services businesses and enter tie-ups with global investors to help it create new revenue streams and secure more market access. Ten banks have been invited to pitch for a role in the IPO, one of the sources said. ADNOC declined to confirm details of the pitching process, but a spokesman told Reuters  central to ADNOC's new approach is the more active management of its portfolio of assets and businesses.   ADNOC is therefore considering the IPO of minority stakes of some of its services businesses and we will update the market on its plans in due course,  the spokesman said. Spokespeople for JPMorgan, HSBC, Goldman Sachs and Rothschild declined to comment. First Abu Dhabi Bank did not respond to a request for comment. ADNOC has no plans to list the holding company. State-owned ADNOC produces around 3 million barrels of oil per day and manages 95 percent of UAE's proven oil reserves and 92 percent of the country's gas reserves.

While the size of the issue has yet to be determined, the notes have a call option after five years and each interest payment date thereafter. The notes will be issued under IBK's USD8 billion global medium-term note programme, which was last updated on 30 June 2017. IBK will use the proceeds for its general corporate purposes. We expect the notes to qualify as Basel III Additional Tier-1 (AT1) securities for regulatory capital purposes. The final rating is contingent upon the receipt of final documents conforming to the information already received. KEY RATING DRIVERS Fitch rates the Basel III AT1 notes four notches below IBK's Viability Rating (VR) of 'a-' by applying two notches for loss severity relative to the recovery prospects of senior unsecured debt and another two notches for the high incremental non-performance risk relative to the anchor rating. The anchor rating of the notes is the VR, which is consistent with Fitch's criteria and captures the notes' going-concern loss-absorption feature - the coupon omission risk. The two notches for the incremental non-performance risk are lower than the typical three notches Fitch would apply to a Korean commercial bank's AT1 notes with similar terms and conditions to IBK's. Management is given full discretion on coupon payments or omissions. However, Fitch views that in practice this decision would be in effect dictated by South Korea's government (AA-/Stable), the policy bank's controlling shareholder and ultimate support provider. We expect the government to be reluctant to allow a coupon omission due to wider implications for the banking system, for example on funding costs. The repercussions of omitting a coupon would potentially not be limited to IBK as the Korean financial system benefits from the stability provided by its policy banks, which in aggregate account for about a quarter of the system's total assets and loans. The two notches for loss severity reflect the notes' poor recovery prospects because the AT1 notes will be fully and permanently written-off if and when IBK is designated by the local regulator as an insolvent financial institution according to Article 2 of the Act on the Structural Improvement of the Financial Industry, the key resolution legislation in Korea. This means that investors would not recover any of their investment. The coupon payments may be partially or fully restricted if IBK's regulatory capital ratios fall into the capital buffer zone (for more details on the capital buffer zone, see <a href= https://www.fitchratings.com/site/pr/1001124 >Fitch: AT1 Coupon Risk in Focus on New Korean Bank Capital Rules, dated 17 March 2016). At end-1Q17, IBK would have surpluses of 2.6 percentage points (pp), 2.5 pp and 2.8 pp to the fully phased-in additional buffer requirements of Common Equity Tier-1, Tier-1 and total capital-adequacy ratios in 2019, respectively, assuming the current 0% countercyclical capital buffer holds. Moreover, a forceful coupon cancellation may be triggered if the local regulator imposes against IBK prompt-corrective measures, pursuant to Article 97 of the Regulation on Supervision of Banking Business. It can also be triggered if the regulator imposes on IBK an emergency measure (eg restrictions on acceptance of deposits and a prohibition on repayment of debts) pursuant to Article 38 of the same regulation. The government has been a responsible shareholder of its policy banks as it has helped them meet all their regulatory capital requirements, mostly by injecting capital into the banks in a proactive manner, and effectively preventing the policy banks' capital ratios from falling into the capital buffer zone. Fitch believes that there is an extremely high probability of the government providing continued ongoing support, if needed, to IBK, and currently does not have concerns over IBK's ability to avoid falling into the capital buffer zone. RATING SENSITIVITIES The rating of IBK's Basel III AT1 notes is sensitive to a change in IBK's Viability Rating, which in turn is sensitive to IBK's operating environment and risk appetite. (For details, see <a href= https://www.fitchratings.com/site/pr/1026041 >Fitch Affirms 3 Korean Policy Banks' IDRs; IBK's VR Rated 'a-', dated 4 July 2017). The rating of the notes is also sensitive to a change in Fitch's assumptions about the notching for incremental non-performance risk. For example, it could be widened if Fitch develops concerns over IBK's ability and flexibility to service full coupon payments on time, which potentially depends on the government's propensity to provide support to IBK.

Britain's biggest current account provider from November will replace several levels of fees plus interest with a daily charge of 1 pence for every 7 pounds ($9.00) customers go into their overdrafts.  This new approach is simple and clear, giving customers more control of their overdraft borrowing and how they manage their finances,  said Vim Maru, group director of customer products at Lloyds. The Competition and Markets Authority said last year that the amount banks can charge for unarranged overdraft fees should be capped after finding lenders were making about 1.2 billion pounds a year from the service. The consumer group Which? has calculated that overdraft fees can be almost eight times more than the cost of payday loans. Mark Somers, the chief operating officer at the consultancy 4most, said the move is likely to put pressure on rival banks to follow suit. But he said banks are still charging customers an effective annual interest rate of about 68 percent.  The interest charges on unauthorised overdrafts are still high,  Somers said. He said the way the changes are being presented  is misleading, as it implies to customers that this is 'cheap money'.

An expert in using minimal equipment to treat patients in basic facilities, Nott returned three years after his previous visit during the 2014 Gaza war between Israel and Palestinian militants. This time, hospitals in Gaza are again struggling to cope with a crisis: power cuts and medicine shortages stemming from tensions between the enclave's ruling Hamas Islamist group and the rival West Bank-based Palestinian Authority. In a hall at a beachfront restaurant this week, Nott  instructed 36 Palestinian surgeons in special techniques to deal with injuries in a war zone.  I was very impressed with the Gaza surgeons last time ... but of course those experiences get less and less as time goes on and you have to then retrain the new surgeons how to deal with those injuries,  he told Reuters.   That is the reason why I am here ... to try and give the surgeons who work in Gaza as much of my knowledge and experiences as I have gained over the last 25 years.  Suhair Zakkout, spokeswoman for the International Committee of the Red Cross in Gaza, which hosted Nott, said his visit would help strengthen emergency medical services in the area and improve health providers' efficiency.

The company, based close to the Alps, makes brakes for Formula One cars and motorbikes and sells them in 70 countries. Hundreds of millions of euros pass through its bank accounts each year – and London is the hub for those flows. As Britain prepares to leave the European Union, the company says it may now have to shift the center of its banking operations to Frankfurt. If Brexit happens with little provision for London's financial services, banks, funds and insurers in London will lose their ability to sell many of their services to European companies. Such upheavals will hurt not just London, say bankers and businessmen, but Europe as well. Financial firms say such shifts will mean the cost of banking for European companies will have to rise, though it is not clear yet who will pick up the bill – the banks or their clients.  At the end of the day it will not be a problem for Brembo, but for our bank,  said Matteo Tiraboschi, executive vice president of Brembo, in an interview at the company's headquarters in Bergamo.  We expect to have the same service for the same price.  Brembo's main bank, Citigroup, declined to comment. Interviews with scores of senior executives from big British and international banks, lawyers, academics, rating agencies and lobbyists outline some of the dangers for companies and consumers from potentially losing access to London's markets. The EU needs London's money, says Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England. He calls Britain  Europe's investment banker  and says half of all the debt and equity issued by the EU involves financial institutions in Britain. Rewiring businesses will be expensive, though estimates vary widely. Investment banks that set up new European outposts to retain access to the EU's single market may see their EU costs rise by between 8 and 22 percent, according to one study by Boston Consulting Group. A separate study by JP Morgan estimates that eight big U.S. and European banks face a combined bill of $7.5 billion over the next five years if they have to move capital markets operations out of London as a result of Brexit. Such costs would equate to an average 2 percent of the banks' global annual expenses, JP Morgan said. Banks say most of those extra costs will end up being paid by customers.  If the cost of production goes up, ultimately a lot of our costs will get passed on to the client base,  said Richard Gnodde, chief executive of the European arm of Goldman Sachs.  As soon as you start to fragment pools of liquidity or fragment capital bases, it becomes less efficient, the costs can go up.  UK-based financial firms are trying to shift some of their operations to Europe to ensure they can still work for EU clients, but warn such a rearrangement of the region's financial architecture could threaten economic stability not only in Britain but also in Europe because so much European money flows through London. European countries, particularly France and Germany, don't share these concerns, viewing Brexit as an opportunity to steal large swathes of business away from Britain and build up their own financial centers. Britain alone accounts for 5.4 percent of global stock markets by value, according to Reuters data. Valdis Dombrovskis, the EU financial services chief, said the EU will still account for 15 percent of global stock markets by value without Britain, and that measures were being taken to strengthen its capital markets. But he added:  Fragmentation is preventing our financial services sector from realizing its full potential.  Industry figures have similar concerns. Jean-Louis Laurens, a former senior Rothschild banker and now ambassador for the French asset management lobby, told Reuters:  If London is broken into pieces then it is not going to be as efficient. Both Europe and Britain are going to lose from this.  Money Machine London is currently home to the world's largest number of banks and hosts the largest commercial insurance market. About six trillion euros ($6.8 trillion), or 37 percent, of Europe's financial assets are managed in the UK capital, almost twice the amount of its nearest rival, Paris. And London dominates Europe's 5.2 trillion euro investment banking industry. London's markets insure French nuclear reactors and Greek ships. German carmakers borrow money for expansion. Dutch pensioners invest their savings. Britain has the largest foreign exchange market and the second largest derivatives market in the world, accounting for just under 40 percent of the world's dealings in those markets, while Paris, London's nearest EU rival, handles under 5 percent, according to the Bank for International Settlements. Each year, euro, yen and dollar trades worth about a combined $869 trillion happen in London - more than in all the euro zone countries combined - according to the City of London Corporation. Barclays Chairman John McFarlane told Reuters that a bad trade deal between Britain and the EU risks harming the international economy, and that some banks may decide to abandon some lines of business altogether because they will be too expensive.  Brexit will put a spotlight on the economic attractiveness of activities you are moving,  he said.  Everybody will say, 'If you move, is it worth it financially?'  Bankers say a number of areas are likely to be affected when Britain leaves the EU. The first is Europe's ability to sell sovereign debt. At present, when a country, say Portugal or Greece, needs to sell debt to keep its hospitals or schools running, it will tap the bond markets, arranged by banks primarily in London. London-based firms are currently responsible for trading about 70 percent of sovereign debt in Europe, according to bankers. But some banks are already withdrawing from arranging the bond sales because it is unprofitable. In the first quarter of the year five banks stopped being primary dealers in various European country bonds, Reuters reported in January. The chief executive of one of Britain's largest banks and one of the largest underwriters of European sovereign debt told Reuters the European Central Bank called him asking him not to abandon selling European debt because of Brexit.  They (EU countries) cannot be shut out from London's capital markets,  he said.  It's suicide.  The ECB declined to comment. A second area that may suffer is the selling of derivatives for companies to buy protection against swings in the U.S. dollar or spikes in the price of oil. Bankers say rivals to London will offer a smaller array of products and at a higher cost because there will be fewer banks offering these services. FILE PHOTO: A businessman walks at La Defense business and financial district in Courbevoie near Paris, France on April 21, 2016.Gonzalo Fuentes/File PhotoA third area likely to be affected is the clearing of derivatives denominated in euros, an activity that London dominates. EU policymakers want such clearing, which ensures the safe completion of a trade, to be shifted to the euro zone after Brexit. Financiers say that would bump up trading costs for continental customers that deal in a variety of currencies because they will have to route trades through multiple clearing houses, requiring them to post more collateral to back those trades. The Futures Industry Association, a global derivatives industry body, says forcing a shift in euro clearing would increase the amount of cash needed to back trades by about $80 billion. German clearing house Eurex, which stands to gain from a shift, said the increase would be a far more modest $3 billion to $9 billion. The global head of foreign exchange markets at one of the world's largest banks said if the amount of cash required to back trades went up as much as $80 billion – nearly a doubling of the current amount - then  it's going to stop the market.  While bankers say it is hard to estimate how much extra it will cost a European company to borrow without direct access to London's markets, the Association for Financial Markets in Europe said in a report early this month that European customers are being overly optimistic if they think lenders will pick up the bill. The report said for companies similar in size to Brembo  any increase in the cost of debt funding and derivatives would therefore have a material impact on the business, making it less competitive.  Brembo's Tiraboschi disagreed.  As far as Brembo is concerned, we do not have indications for a growth in financing costs linked to Brexit,  he said. Reality Check Last autumn, the British government set about persuading Europe of the risks the EU faces if London's position as a financial center is damaged. A research paper by Ernst & Young surveying major corporates, including Volkswagen and Airbus, found that companies across Europe were worried about the cost of funding rising. The paper, which was commissioned by the City of London Corporation, a municipal body that runs the financial district, was sent to policymakers across the EU. The British government predicted that European companies would tell their respective governments they face higher costs and potential disruption, putting pressure on politicians to take this into account during Brexit negotiations. Slideshow (11 Images)In a speech in late June, British finance minister Philip Hammond said Europe will only hurt its own economy if it undermines London's status as a global finance hub.  Fragmentation of financial services would result in poorer quality, higher priced products for everyone concerned,  he said. But Jeremy Browne, the City of London Corporation's special envoy for Europe, who has visited 26 EU countries over the past year, said many companies and politicians are willing to accept higher prices in return for sticking to EU principles and not giving London any special exemptions.  They are not getting down on one knee begging their governments to be nice to Britain,  Browne said. The UK Treasury declined to comment. With formal divorce talks now triggered, the EU is wasting no time in regrouping to try to replicate Britain's financial services on euro zone soil, egged on by the powerful European Central Bank (ECB). In 2015, the EU launched a  capital markets union  project to improve the way companies can raise funds from stocks, bonds and other securities. That project is now being given more priority, the European Commission said in early June. The ECB says that a  new equilibrium  may be beneficial in the long term to euro zone banks looking to take advantage of business opportunities created by Brexit – while an increase in financing costs is likely to be only  modest  in the near term. Christian Noyer, a former central bank governor of France, is now wooing financial firms to relocate to France. He told Reuters that if European banks had time to adapt  they will do exactly the same job  as London does now.  I don't believe for a minute it will be detrimental,  he said. At least eight European cities are vying for financial firms to set up entities in Europe, hoping to attract their highly-paid employees. The French government has been the most aggressive, dangling the promise of tax breaks and flexible labor laws to complement the French capital's cultural charms. The chief financial officer at one of Europe's biggest banks said he sat through a recent presentation by French officials highlighting the restaurants and nightlife in Paris.  It was all very Moulin Rouge,  he said. A senior German lobbying official, who recently held meetings with the German government, said there is a feeling that Britain is failing to understand that the European project comes first.  British politicians think they are in a position whereby the EU 27 will say, 'OK, there are lots of problems for the EU so we will agree on a trade deal as otherwise the EU will be faced with turmoil as well.' They just don't get it,  he said. Infighting Bankers are skeptical about Europe's efforts to replicate London. They say continental Europe is too leery of Anglo-Saxon free-market capitalism - which many politicians and economists blamed for the 2008 to 2009 global financial crisis. London's dominance as a financial center has been built up over decades and would be very hard to replicate, especially with any speed, given the global talent pool, the widespread use of the UK legal system and the vast amount of money that is managed through London, say executives. The head of European operations at a large U.S. investment bank said that if Europe ever managed to reform its labor laws, develop its capital markets and attract a global workforce, then it would mark the decline of London as a financial center. But Europe may miss this opportunity, he said, because of infighting between EU countries and no clear plan for where jobs and assets will end up. Discord between the euro zone's three largest countries – Germany, France and Italy - initially stalled the ECB's efforts to come up with a way to force euro clearing out of London and put it under its watch, three sources told Reuters in May. Europe  will end up with a hodgepodge of financial centers,  the U.S. executive said. This is  a humongous risk,  he said.  If Europe becomes so unattractive, we just won't be as big in Europe as we are today. Europe won't win.  Instead, some bankers predict the big gainer could be New York, 3,500 miles away. They say it is the only place that can replicate London's depth of markets and expertise.

The company has a total number of 460 petrol stations after the opening up of several new ones since the start of the year, it said in a statement on Wednesday. ADNOC's listing could stir the UAE's lackluster IPO scene from its recent slumber. There have been only two initial public offerings (IPOs) so far in 2017 in the UAE, raising $348.5 million, and none at all last year, Thomson Reuters data shows. Other oil companies looking to raise money from listings of retail units include China Petroleum and Chemical Corp, which is planning to list its retail unit in Hong Kong and Thailand's biggest energy company PTT which is examining a proposal to list its retail business. The pitching process for the ADNOC deal is under way after the unlisted group announced this week that it is looking to float some of its services businesses and enter tie-ups with global investors to help it create new revenue streams and secure more market access. Ten banks have been invited to pitch for a role in the IPO, one of the sources said. ADNOC declined to confirm details of the pitching process, but a spokesman told Reuters  central to ADNOC's new approach is the more active management of its portfolio of assets and businesses.   ADNOC is therefore considering the IPO of minority stakes of some of its services businesses and we will update the market on its plans in due course,  the spokesman said. Spokespeople for JPMorgan, HSBC, Goldman Sachs and Rothschild declined to comment. First Abu Dhabi Bank did not respond to a request for comment. ADNOC has no plans to list the holding company. State-owned ADNOC produces around 3 million barrels of oil per day and manages 95 percent of UAE's proven oil reserves and 92 percent of the country's gas reserves.

The ministry said most of Cambodia's sand had gone toward the expansion of the island city-state of Singapore, and it would now have to look for other sources. Environmental groups have been pressing the government to stop the trade, saying the digging and dredging of sand has had a serious impact on coastal ecosystems and surrounding land. Groups have complained that sand in recent months has been exported illegally following a temporary ban in November 2016. A ministry spokesman, Meng Saktheara, said the government was responding to the concerns of the campaigners and it also agreed that large-scale sand mining was indeed damaging.  Their worries are right that the risks are massive so the ministry decided to ban sand exports and large-scale sand dredging,  Meng Saktheara told Reuters. Meng Saktheara said Singapore was Cambodia's top market for sand until last year when the temporary ban came into force, and had it imported some 16 million tonnes of sand since 2007. U.N. trade data released last year showed that Singapore had imported more than 72 million tonnes of sand, worth more than $740 million, from Cambodia since 2007. It was not clear why there was such a big difference between the official government figure for exports to Singapore since 2007 and the U.N. figure.     Singapore's embassy in Phnom Penh did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Some environmental groups remained skeptical about the ban being properly enforced.

Recently valued at $13 billion, Sweden's Spotify is planning a direct listing on the New York Stock Exchange later this year or in early 2018, sources told Reuters in May. Sony  agreed to reduce royalties that Spotify must pay in return for the streaming service restricting new albums to paying subscribers for two weeks before offering access to free users, the Financial Times reported, citing a single source. Sony's top artists include Adele, Beyonce and Shakira. Spotify is also in talks with Warner Music Group , Billboard reported. Favorable royalty terms are crucial for Spotify to attain profitability and to make it a viable long-term holding for investors. The company reported a 349 million euro ($400 million) operating loss, a 47 percent increase on a year earlier, even as revenue grew 50 percent to 2.93 billion euros. In April, it signed a multi-year licensing deal with Vivendi's Universal Music Group, with a similar two-week release window for new albums and a break on the royalties Spotify pays Universal. It also signed up digital agency Merlin, on behalf of more than 20,000 independent labels. Last year, Universal held a 28.9 percent share of global music label revenue, Sony Music generated 22.4 percent and Warner 17.4 percent. Independent labels made up the remaining 31.3 percent, MIDiA Research data showed. Spotify has fended off competition from rival Apple Music, with nearly double the number of paying subscribers.  In March, Spotify said it had more than 50 million paying subscribers and 140 million active users, including free listeners. Apple reported 27 million music subscribers last month, up from 20 million in December. The company has faced boycotts from some top music artists who have complained its free services undercut the value of their work but the major label licensing deals have gone some way toward easing these tensions, according to analysts. Spotify declined to comment. Sony Music Entertainment and Warner Music Group did not respond to requests for immediate comment.

There are examples of banks that have been hiring significant numbers of people in London,  CEO Robert Walters told Reuters, adding that financial companies continued to hire for compliance, cybersecurity, risk, audit and technology.  I would say that anyone in our business, anyone in our game at the moment should be reasonably confident (that these firms) are in the UK for the future.  His comments echoed the view of larger rival PageGroup , which said on Tuesday that financial companies were currently talking about moving only very small teams to the continent. Many financial companies have committed to move some British jobs to continental Europe to keep serving clients in the single market. However, Walters said the fall in the pound's value had made British workers cheaper, prompting companies to rethink their plans. When asked whether financial firms had begun hiring aggressively on the continent, Walters said:  No, nothing's physically happening at the moment.  A lack of sufficient skilled labour for the finance sector and stringent labour laws in places such as France had also deterred many, causing some to overturn their publicly made Brexit relocation plans, he said. Chief Financial Officer Alan Bannatyne said that hiring for roles in London's financial services sector grew 10 percent in the three months to June, marking one of the strongest growth areas across the British hiring market. The strength of hiring in London and its other markets helped Robert Walters' net fee income rise 25 percent in April-June, it said, sending its shares up 6 percent on Wednesday as it said it expected full-year profit to beat market expectations. That contrasted with PageGroup which reported a fall in gross profit from the UK market on Tuesday, as quarterly hiring in financial services in Britain fell 15 percent. While PageGroup said concern about political stability following last month's election had compounded the uncertainty caused by the Brexit vote a year ago, Bannatyne said Robert Walters saw a  strong  end to June. The company made 28 percent of its overall net fee income from its domestic market, which grew 13 percent to 24.3 million pounds ($31 million) over the quarter. Robert Walters said its net fee income totalled 86.3 million pounds for the quarter after its international business also grew. It now expects annual pretax profit for 2017 to beat analysts' expectations of 30.1 million pounds. Hays, Britain's largest listed recruitment company, is due to report results on Thursday.

Twenty-one percent of streaming viewers ages 18 to 24 said they had accessed at least one digital video service such as Netflix Inc, HBO Now or Hulu by using log-in credentials from someone outside their household at some time. Overall, 12 percent of adults said they did the same thing. (tmsnrt.rs/2sUQIYJ) Subscription revenue is likely to come under scrutiny starting next week when TV industry players begin reporting quarterly earnings. Netflix, the dominant streaming service, releases its results on Monday. Up to now, Netflix and other streaming networks have accepted some password-sharing, but they may face pressure from investors to change course if new sign-ups slow substantially, Wall Street analysts said. Revenue growth at Netflix is projected to drop from 31 percent in this year's second quarter to 19 percent in the second quarter of next year, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  If Netflix goes from a 30 percent revenue growth story to a 10 percent story, there is absolutely going to be more focus on their leaving money on the table,  said Justin Patterson, an analyst with Raymond James. Netflix declined to comment. Respondents to the Reuters/Ipsos survey said they borrow passwords to save money on video subscriptions, which can be cheap on their own but add up with multiple services. Donielle Bradshaw, a live-in nanny in Smyrna, Georgia, said she uses her 28-year-old sister’s password for Hulu, and her 32-year-old brother’s password for Netflix.  I feel like since we are family, it’s OK,  said the 22-year-old Bradshaw, who estimates she watches four hours of shows on weeknights and 10 hours a day on weekends. If companies cracked down on password sharing, Bradshaw said she would be willing to pay for her own Netflix subscription but is not sure about Hulu, which is owned by several media companies.  I binge a lot of shows on Netflix. I don’t think I could do without it,  she said. Companies say they accept some sharing as a way to promote their programming to potential customers, but they also take steps to curtail blatant freeloading. Many networks limit the number of people who can watch programming at the same time. Netflix, for example, allows two to four simultaneous streams per subscription, depending on the plan, and charges more for the higher number of streams. HBO, a unit of Time Warner Inc, actually encourages younger viewers to use its HBO Now and HBO Go services for free by offering it to about 100 U.S. colleges and universities.  For us it’s more important that at that age where they are not financially independent quite yet, they are habituating to using the product to ultimately aspiring to becoming paid customers,  Bernadette Aulestia, executive vice president of global distribution, said in an interview. Netflix executives also have said they know some viewers share passwords.  We could crack down on it, but you wouldn't suddenly turn all those folks to paid users,  Netflix Chief Financial Officer David Wells said at a Goldman Sachs conference last September. Missing a Chance Industry analysts say companies are missing a chance to grow revenue. An analysis by Parks Associates estimated streaming providers will lose $550 million in 2019 from password sharing.  There has been this kind of cavalier attitude about it,  Parks Associates analyst Glenn Hower said.  It hasn't been a priority.  Companies could crack down if they want. Cisco Systems Inc , for example, sells products that can detect abnormal activity on an account such as an unusual time or place, said Conrad Clemson, Cisco's senior vice president and general manager of service provider platforms and applications. Cisco's customers, which include streaming services and pay TV distributors, decide whether to use the information simply for monitoring or take additional steps such as sending a warning to account holders or shutting down an account, he said.  A lot of service providers and content providers are very much in the experimental phase right now,  he said. Streaming providers say they do track account use but have provided few specifics. The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online in English throughout the United States from June 8 to June 26. It gathered responses from 4,453 adults, including 3,557 people who said they streamed video from their cable TV provider or from standalone services like Amazon Prime, Hulu or Netflix. The poll has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 2 percentage points.

More than half of people who take their pension savings early withdraw the full amount, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said in an update on its review of the retirement market. People have been allowed to get access to their pension savings following the introduction of new rules in 2015 that removed the need to use the money to buy an annuity, or a fixed income for life.  Since the introduction of the pension freedoms, the retirement income market has changed substantially,  Christopher Woolard, the FCA's executive director of strategy and competition, said.  We have identified areas where early intervention may be needed either now or further down the track to put the market on the best footing for the future.  One year into the FCA's review, the watchdog found that twice as many pension savings  pots  were moving into so-called  drawdown  funds based on investment returns, which give flexibility on how much money can be taken out each year, rather than put into annuities. Fifty three percent of pots accessed were fully withdrawn, although 90 percent of them were small, below 30,000 pounds ($38,000), and most of those doing so had other sources of income in addition to the state pension, the FCA said. People who withdrew their pots did so partly because they did not trust pensions, it said. While 52 percent of fully withdrawn pots were reinvested somewhere else, savers might be paying too much tax, missing out on investment growth and other benefits, the watchdog said. Of those who fully withdrew their savings, 14 percent spent the largest share paying off mortgage or other debt, 25 percent spent it on home repairs, a car or other purchases, 32 percent saved most of it and 20 percent invested it in property, a business or in bonds or stocks. Those who withdraw money early without taking advice typically followed the  path of least resistance  and stuck with their current pension provider for a drawdown product without shopping around, the FCA said. With some large pension providers pulling out of the annuity market, there was also a risk of reduced competition over time, and product innovation was currently limited. As a result, the FCA said it would look at whether extra protections were needed for consumers who buy drawdown products without advice, whether consumers were paying too-high charges and if they ended up with unsuitable investment strategies. It would also look to improve competition by asking the government to consider proposals to enable consumers to access their savings early without having to make a decision about the remainder of their pot. Consumers may also need better tools and services to help them better understand their options and improve trust in pensions, the regulator said. The FCA said it would consider whether it should intervene at this stage and how it could do this most effectively. Investment managers also warned that savers may not be making wise decisions. Jon Greer, head of retirement policy at Old Mutual Wealth, said:  Savers are giving up future tax-free investment growth in a pension in exchange for comparatively low-growth assets like cash, or illiquid property.  But insurers said the problem might not be as widespread as the FCA indicated. Huw Evans, director general of the Association of British Insurers, said  Our own data does not support the view that accessing pension savings early has become 'the new norm'.

Recently valued at $13 billion, Sweden's Spotify is planning a direct listing on the New York Stock Exchange later this year or in early 2018, sources told Reuters in May. Sony  agreed to reduce royalties that Spotify must pay in return for the streaming service restricting new albums to paying subscribers for two weeks before offering access to free users, the Financial Times reported, citing a single source. Sony's top artists include Adele, Beyonce and Shakira. Spotify is also in talks with Warner Music Group , Billboard reported. Favorable royalty terms are crucial for Spotify to attain profitability and to make it a viable long-term holding for investors. The company reported a 349 million euro ($400 million) operating loss, a 47 percent increase on a year earlier, even as revenue grew 50 percent to 2.93 billion euros. In April, it signed a multi-year licensing deal with Vivendi's Universal Music Group, with a similar two-week release window for new albums and a break on the royalties Spotify pays Universal. It also signed up digital agency Merlin, on behalf of more than 20,000 independent labels. Last year, Universal held a 28.9 percent share of global music label revenue, Sony Music generated 22.4 percent and Warner 17.4 percent. Independent labels made up the remaining 31.3 percent, MIDiA Research data showed. Spotify has fended off competition from rival Apple Music, with nearly double the number of paying subscribers.  In March, Spotify said it had more than 50 million paying subscribers and 140 million active users, including free listeners. Apple reported 27 million music subscribers last month, up from 20 million in December. The company has faced boycotts from some top music artists who have complained its free services undercut the value of their work but the major label licensing deals have gone some way toward easing these tensions, according to analysts. Spotify declined to comment. Sony Music Entertainment and Warner Music Group did not respond to requests for immediate comment.

OPEC agreements have been specified in terms of output rather than exports since the first allocations were agreed in March 1982 (“Annual Statistical Bulletin”, OPEC, 2017). Quotas, as the production allocations are informally known, apply to crude oil but not to condensates or other natural gas liquids. The system originally made sense but now appears increasingly outdated because of the rising production of natural gas liquids and the growing oil consumption within OPEC countries themselves. Between 1980 and 2016, OPEC’s crude production increased by 31 percent from 25.4 million barrels per day to 33.3 million bpd. But OPEC’s output of natural gas liquids sextupled from 1.0 million bpd to 5.8 million bpd over the same period. And OPEC’s internal oil consumption more than tripled from 2.6 million bpd in 1980 to 9.0 million bpd in 2016. In fact, OPEC’s own members have reported some of the fastest growth in oil consumption over the last four decades owing to population expansion and increasing prosperity. OPEC’s share of world oil demand has climbed from just 1.8 percent in 1973 and 4.1 percent in 1980 to peak at 9.9 percent in 2015 before edging down to 9.5 percent in 2016. OPEC’s internal demand has risen from 18 percent of its crude oil production in 1982 to as much as 28 percent in 2016. At the same time, some OPEC members have invested heavily in refineries and petrochemical plants to capture more value-added from their exports. OPEC’s refining capacity has grown from 5.3 million bpd in 1980 to 11.8 million bpd in 2016, according to the organization's data. The result of these changes is that crude production is less and less relevant to the volume and composition of the crude and refined products that OPEC exports to the rest of the world. Exports, net of any imports, rather than crude production, are what matters for the world supply-demand balance and global oil inventories. Confusion There are a range of other problems when it comes to analyzing OPEC production data. OPEC’s internal consumption has a strong seasonal element. Saudi Arabia and Iraq burn large volumes of crude and fuel oil in the summer to meet electricity and air-conditioning demand. So the same level of wellhead production can be associated with very different levels of exports and volumes of oil supplied to the market depending on the time of year. Conversely, the same level of exports can be associated with very different levels of output, depending on refinery intake and the amount of crude and fuel oil burned in domestic power plants. Saudi Arabia has been building gas-fired power plants to reduce combustion of crude and fuel oil for electricity generation.  While the policy is sensible, it has led to a significant shift in the relationship between production and exports and become an additional source of uncertainty. Adding to the confusion, wellhead production is known only to the countries concerned, cannot be independently verified and is reported with a long delay. A host of commercial tanker-tracking services have been launched in response, estimating export volumes in real time based on information broadcast by shipboard automatic identification systems (AIS). Like other commercial ships, oil tankers must be fitted with AIS equipment that continuously broadcasts critical safety data, including the vessel’s position, speed, heading, destination, cargo, dimensions and draught. Cross-checked with data from other sources, including port authorities and bills of lading, the AIS data can be modeled to estimate the volume of crude and other products being exported. Thomson Reuters has its own ship-tracking service but oil flows are also estimated by standalone cargo-tracking companies including Kpler. As with any model, the estimates are sensitive to the assumptions made to convert the AIS data into export volumes. But AIS data is available in real time, so many analysts rely on export estimates rather than wait for government production figures to track the volume of oil OPEC is supplying. The result has been confusion as analysts and traders struggle to reconcile government data on production and exports with commercial estimates of exports based on ship tracking. Ultimately, analysts and traders care about the volume and composition of crude and refined products being supplied to the market by OPEC members, rather than the amount produced at the wellhead. But OPEC’s current agreement focuses on wellhead output, which is neither verifiable nor particularly relevant, and leaves the market trying to figure out how it will translate into oil supply and inventories. In the future, OPEC members might want to consider an agreement that focuses on exports, and excludes internal consumption, as simpler and more transparent.

An increasing number of companies in the digital space have exploited loopholes in the domestic tax system to minimize their tax liabilities, Sri Mulyani Indrawati said in a speech at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) conference in Jakarta. The corporate tax avoidance has put Indonesia's local businesses that comply with regulations at a competitive disadvantage, said Indrawati, who was previously a managing director at the World Bank and an executive director at the IMF.  Aggressive tax planning is part of MNCs' core business,  Indrawati said.  This is not good, not only for tax revenue but (also) injuring and damaging the sense of justice. And I know, coming back to Indonesia (from the World Bank), this is maybe the most important feeling that needs to be addressed,  she added. Indonesia's government has been pushing multinational technology firms to incorporate locally, arguing that the practice of setting up small business entities to provide  auxiliary  services allows them to get away with minimal taxation, while booking most of their revenue from the country elsewhere. Last month, Indonesian officials said Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google Asia Pacific headquarters had agreed on future tax payments after a months-long dispute with the government, paving the way for a shake up in the way similar firms operate in the country. Indonesia's Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati (L) shakes hands with with Malaysia's Deputy Minister of Finance Johari Abdul Ghani, as IMF Deputy Managing Director Mitsuhiro Furusawa (C) stands during the International Tax Conference in Jakarta, Indonesia, July 12, 2017.BeawihartaSeparately, the country's investment chief said last month social networking giant Facebook Inc (FB.O) was in the process of setting up a domestic unit in Indonesia. 'Unwanted Side Effects' IMF's deputy managing director said the expansion of economic integration and cross-border investment has produced some  unwanted side effects , including the  aggressive tax planning by multinational and regional companies.  The fund is working with countries to find ways to counter the artificial shifting of profits and assets to low-tax locations and to resist  damaging tax competition , Mitsuhiro Furusawa said in a speech at the IMF conference in Jakarta. Furusawa also said that in much of Asia, the tax-to-GDP ratio  consistently  falls below the 15 percent ratio  associated with a significant acceleration of growth and development.  Indrawati said that Indonesia's current tax-to-GDP ratio of 10.3 percent was  hard to swallow  and she is committed to raising that ratio to 16 percent by 2019.  It is a very ambitious target and I know my colleagues from IMF and World Bank both say it is impossible, so it is a challenge,  she said.  But I'm sure I love the challenge. If not I'd rather stay at the World Bank and do my old job,  she said.

Of the region's central banks, the Czechs are the only ones who have shifted to a hawkish policy bias.     In April the bank ended its policy of capping the crown  at 27 versus the euro, letting the currency strengthen. Its forecasts have also factored in a hike in its record low interest rates for the third quarter of the year.      Economic growth has picked up to around 3-4 percent in Central European states, but a rise in inflation since last year has lost steam in recent months.     Data released on Wednesday showed a drop in annual inflation to 2.3 percent in June from 2.4 percent in May.     But the drop was the result of lower fuel inflation. A continuing rise in core inflation to 2.6 percent provides the CNB with sufficient argument to lift rates as early as its next meeting on Aug. 3, Capital Economics analyst Liam Carson said in a note.     The crown firmed after the figures, approaching last week's 3-1/2-year highs of 26.048. But it was unable to break below the 26.1 line, and at 0855 GMT it traded at 26.105.     Analysts remained split over the rate outlook.     KBC analysts said in a note that the CNB faced a dilemma after the data as the headline figure was above its 2 percent target but below its own projection and may decrease further in the next months.      Hence, the case (of) a rate hike in the third quarter, which had been advocated by some Board members and it still assumes the central bank projection, is not as clear as it looks,  they said.     Other Central European currencies were mixed as investors awaited more clues about global interest rate trends from Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen's testimony to the U.S. Congress starting on Wednesday.     The dinar, however, extended its recent gains and hit 21-month highs against the euro.      The Serbian central bank kept the region's highest benchmark rate on hold at 4 percent on Monday, citing uncertainties in global interest rate trends.     Just after the decision it had to keep intervening in the market to prevent the dinar firming. Dealers said there were no signs of continuing interventions early on Wednesday.

The blue-chip FTSE 100 index was up 0.7 percent by 0900 GMT, with oil and gas stocks the top boost. Crude prices rose above $48 after a drop in U.S. fuel inventories raised hopes a supply glut was easing. Royal Dutch Shell and BP were up 1.8 percent each, among top FTSE gainers, while Tullow Oil and Cairn Energy gained 2 to 3 percent on the mid-cap index. The FTSE shrugged off labour market data that showed unemployment fell to the lowest since 1975, but earnings remained weak.  Inflation is now above the Bank's target level and real earnings growth has slipped into negative territory,  said Ian Kernohan, economist at Royal London Asset Management.  This is having a negative impact on household spending.  Spending from Chinese tourists making the most of a devalued pound, however, boosted luxury trenchcoat maker Burberry , whose shares rose 2.5 percent after its like-for-like sales rose by double the rate expected by analysts. Burberry's CFO also said UK domestic demand remains very strong.  This is an encouraging performance from Burberry, which looks to be at long last pulling out of the doldrums,  said Steve Clayton, manager of the Hargreaves Lansdown select UK growth fund. Micro Focus was the top FTSE faller, down 6.6 percent after disappointing full-year results.  Micro Focus shares have been soggy since the May 9 news of poor trading at HPE Software, and now there are growing concerns about the expected U.S. flowback,  Stifel analysts said in a note. Shares in education publisher Pearson slid again, hitting a 3-month low as investors' concerns over a lower dividend guidance weighed. Outsourcer Carillion collapsed further, down 10.3 percent to a fresh record low, taking its losses over the past three sessions to 64 percent as worries over a potential rights issue caused another broker downgrade. Amec Foster Wheeler bucked the trend among oil and gas stocks, down 6.9 percent after the oil services group said the Serious Fraud Office was investigating it over allegations of bribery, corruption and related offences. Wood Group, which has agreed to buy Amec Foster Wheeler in a 2.2 billion pound deal, also fell 6.5 percent to a 17-month low.  Although the outcome of the investigation is uncertain, and not anticipated to be resolved quickly, we do not expect this to have an impact on completion of the acquisition by Wood Group, which is expected to be completed in Q4 2017,  said Victoria McCulloch, oil services analyst at RBC Capital Markets. Small-cap Premier Oil shot up 30 percent after the company made an oil discovery off the shores of Mexico.

The watchdog, known by its Dutch acronym ACM, said it had visited some of the dozens of companies active in fuel production, transportation, storage and trading in Rotterdam, Antwerp and Amsterdam after receiving information from the police. The ACM, which did not name any of the companies, said in a statement it had asked anyone with relevant information to come forward. The port of Rotterdam is Europe's largest bunkering port, as well as one of the top three bunkering ports worldwide. Listed Dutch tank storage company Vopak is among the companies active in the sector, but said in an email it didn't expect to be impacted by the investigation, since it's not involved in  the pricing and trading of bunker fuels . Fines for participants in a cartel can amount to 40 percent of a company's worldwide annual revenue, or to 900.000 euros for people in charge of the deals. Fines can be lowered for companies that admit wrongdoing, the ACM said. The possible shipping fuel cartel is not the first on the radar of the ACM in the port of Rotterdam, Europe's largest. In recent years, it opened inquiries into possible price-fixing schemes involving tugboat companies and a large container terminal. These investigations are still ongoing, a spokesman for the ACM said on Wednesday.

Faraday is part of a network of young electric vehicle (EV) firms in China and the United States backed by Jia, who has said his company LeEco - that grew from a Netflix-like video website to a business empire spanning consumer electronics to cars within 13 years - is facing a severe shortage of cash after expanding too fast and in too many directions. Struggling to support goals that included beating Elon Musk's Tesla Motors (TSLA.O) in premium EV making, Jia is now trying to ride out the cash crunch by taking measures such as halting work on the Las Vegas factory and selling a Silicon Valley property less than a year after buying it from Yahoo Inc YHOO.O. On the latest decision to shift production of Faraday's luxury electric SUV FF 91 to a new site, the startup said:  This will allow product production to be realized faster, as well as allow our future strategy to be implemented more effectively.  For LeEco, this marks a second major setback to its ambition to become a major EV manufacturer after it recently pulled out of a joint project with British sports carmaker Aston Martin to develop RapidE electric car. FILE PHOTO: The front of a Faraday Future FF 91 electric car is shown during an unveiling event at CES in Las Vegas, Nevada January 3, 2017.Steve Marcus/File PhotoFaraday had initially planned to open the Las Vegas factory late in 2017, with a product portfolio of seven models - an estimate that was later slashed to two, including the FF 91. Jia, who posted the Faraday statement on his social media account, did not name the new FF 91 production location. Faraday will continue to own the Nevada factory site. The FF 91 has been described by its designer as  weird-pretty  and Faraday executives say it will be the most technologically advanced vehicle of its kind on the market when it goes into production in early 2018. But cash shortages have raised questions about the company's prospects. According to estimates from mutual fund investors, LeEco could see the market value of its listed unit, Leshi Internet Information & Technology Corp Beijing (300104.SZ), fall around $2.5 billion should its shares resume trading. The company is set to hold an extraordinary shareholders' meeting on July 17 in the Chinese city of Shenzhen.

The ministry said most of Cambodia's sand had gone toward the expansion of the island city-state of Singapore, and it would now have to look for other sources. Environmental groups have been pressing the government to stop the trade, saying the digging and dredging of sand has had a serious impact on coastal ecosystems and surrounding land. Groups have complained that sand in recent months has been exported illegally following a temporary ban in November 2016. A ministry spokesman, Meng Saktheara, said the government was responding to the concerns of the campaigners and it also agreed that large-scale sand mining was indeed damaging.  Their worries are right that the risks are massive so the ministry decided to ban sand exports and large-scale sand dredging,  Meng Saktheara told Reuters. Meng Saktheara said Singapore was Cambodia's top market for sand until last year when the temporary ban came into force, and had it imported some 16 million tonnes of sand since 2007. U.N. trade data released last year showed that Singapore had imported more than 72 million tonnes of sand, worth more than $740 million, from Cambodia since 2007. It was not clear why there was such a big difference between the official government figure for exports to Singapore since 2007 and the U.N. figure.     Singapore's embassy in Phnom Penh did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Some environmental groups remained skeptical about the ban being properly enforced.  Sand is being dredged ... are we sure that sand is not being exported?  asked Lim Kimsor, an activist with the group Mother Nature.

It was a third-straight day of gains for MSCI's 24-country EM stocks index as markets from Hong Kong to Poland, as well as recently-hammered Qatar all powered higher. A jump in oil prices also helped Russian stocks and the rouble shrug off the latest twist in the Trump story as bond yields dipped too. E-mails showed his eldest son had eagerly agreed to meet with a woman he was told was a Russian government lawyer with damaging information about Hillary Clinton. South Korea's won, Taiwan's dollar and the Thai baht had all posted their biggest intraday gains in at least a month in Asia trading. EMEA followed their lead, showing none of the usual caution ahead of a semi-annual Congressional grilling of Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen later, likely to produce signals on U.S. interest rates and the Fed's plans to shrink its balance sheet. The rand, which has been battered by political uncertainty in recent weeks, saw its biggest jump in almost a month as it climbed to 13.4525 per dollar. It also shrugged off a delay to quasi-sovereign utility Eskom's annual results after external auditors found  irregularities . The lira which has also been hammered along with the rand and rouble was steady, while Poland's zloty and Hungary's forint which have been soaring consolidated the respective 2017 and two-year highs versus the dollar they had hit on Tuesday.  We had a big move in dollar versus CEE currencies yesterday,  said Rabobank emerging markets strategist Piotr Matys.  Key levels were broken including the zloty at 3.7 (per dollar) so unless Yellen says something particularly hawkish in her testimony later CEE crosses will remain front heavy.  Focus remained on China's credit growth too, as data showed banks extended 1.54 trillion yuan ($226.9 billion) in net new yuan loans in June, well above analysts' expectations. The prospect of a default by Venezuela also seems to mounting. Rating agency S&P; Global cut its rating on the strained South American country to CCC-, the last rung before default late on Tuesday.

Its banks, which include Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp and Mizuho Bank, had denied Toshiba access to an agreed commitment line of 680 billion yen earlier this year after its credit ratings were slashed due to writedowns for the nuclear unit, Westinghouse. Toshiba was allowed to withdraw 100 billion yen ($880 million) in loans late last month but must reseek permission every week from creditors to extend the loan, the sources said, declining to be identified as they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.  A Toshiba spokeswoman declined to comment. SMBC and Mizuho officials were not immediately available for comment.      Toshiba has told creditors it will need 1 trillion yen in fresh loans during the current financial year through March, banking sources have said previously. Western Digital Corp, Toshiba's joint venture partner for its flash memory chip business, is seeking a U.S. court injunction to stop any sale of the unit without its consent and is also opposed to the use of the unit's shares as collateral. After a long period of deliberation, Toshiba and its lenders concluded they can use the unit's shares as collateral even without Western Digital's consent, the sources said.

Liu, a prominent participant in the Tiananmen pro-democracy protests of 1989, was jailed for 11 years in 2009 for  inciting subversion of state power  after helping to write a petition known as  Charter 08  calling for sweeping political reforms. He was recently moved from jail to a hospital to be treated for late-stage liver cancer. Liu's kidney and liver functions are failing and he suffers from blood clots, among other ailments, the hospital in the city of Shenyang said on its website. However, Liu's family has declined the use of intubation machinery to help him breathe with the aid of a plastic tube in his windpipe, the hospital said.  The patient is in a critically ill condition, the hospital is doing all it can to save him, and his family members understand the situation and have given their signatures,  it added, without elaborating. The announcement suggested a significant deterioration in Liu's health since early on Wednesday, when the hospital said he was being treated for worsening liver function, septic shock and organ dysfunction. Rights groups and Western governments have urged China to allow Liu and his wife, Liu Xia, to leave the country to be treated abroad, as Liu has said he wants. But the government has warned against interference and has said Liu is being treated by renowned Chinese cancer experts. Liu's international counsel Jared Genser told Reuters that getting him out of China for treatment was a realistic possibility if approval was granted soon.  But time is of the essence,  he said.  Every moment that passes makes that possibility more difficult.  White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders repeated a call for Liu to be free to travel abroad for treatment.  We remain concerned that Mr. Liu and his family are unable to communicate with the outside world and that he is not free to seek the medical treatment of his choosing,  she told a regular news briefing. A White House official said U.S. President Donald Trump raised Liu's case in a July 2 telephone call with Chinese President Xi Jinping, while the U.S. national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, raised it with his Chinese counterpart at the G20 meeting last week. Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo is seen in this undated photo released by his families. Handout viaFile PhotoJohn Kamm, of the San Francisco-based Dui Hua Foundation, which promotes prisoners' rights in China, said that based on what he had heard from official and unofficial sources,  I do not think the chance that (Liu) will be allowed to leave China for medical treatment is big . China's state-backed Global Times tabloid said the  confrontational tone  of those in the West voicing their opinions on Liu failed to focus on his illness.   China has already taken the feelings of relevant Western forces into consideration, and has no obligation to meet their unreasonable demands,  it said. The government allowed two foreign doctors, from the United States and Germany, to visit Liu on Saturday and they later said they considered it was safe for him to be moved overseas. After the doctors' Sunday statement, China released short videos of their visit, apparently taken without their knowledge, in which the German doctor appeared to praise the care Liu had received. Slideshow (3 Images)'Keep Calling' Hu Jia, a dissident and friend of Liu's, said he was deeply saddened to hear the news of his worsening condition but vowed to do all he could to push for Liu's freedom.  So long as Liu is still breathing and conscious, we should keep calling for him to be released and go abroad with Liu Xia, even if it is the last thing he does,  Hu said. Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen said on Twitter that the self-ruled island, which China claims as its own, called on Beijing to free Liu and Taiwan was willing to provide medical assistance. Liu's friends voiced suspicion about the hospital's earlier statement, which suggested a worsening of his health soon after two foreign doctors said he was well enough to travel abroad.  We do not know how reliable these accounts are, or if they mean Liu Xiaobo cannot travel,  one family friend told Reuters, declining to be identified because of the sensitivity of the situation. No one answered the telephone at the hospital's publicity department on Wednesday. In Hong Kong, about 50 protesters sat outside the Beijing representative office surrounded by placards demanding Liu's release. Some protesters had been there for a third day.  I feel scared. If we lose Liu Xiaobo, nobody could replace him,  said 17-year-old student Anson Hui.  If there's no Liu Xiaobo we can't unite the whole world to speak out ...

Faraday is part of a network of young electric vehicle (EV) firms in China and the United States backed by Jia, who has said his company LeEco - that grew from a Netflix-like video website to a business empire spanning consumer electronics to cars within 13 years - is facing a severe shortage of cash after expanding too fast and in too many directions. Struggling to support goals that included beating Elon Musk's Tesla Motors (TSLA.O) in premium EV making, Jia is now trying to ride out the cash crunch by taking measures such as halting work on the Las Vegas factory and selling a Silicon Valley property less than a year after buying it from Yahoo Inc YHOO.O. On the latest decision to shift production of Faraday's luxury electric SUV FF 91 to a new site, the startup said:  This will allow product production to be realized faster, as well as allow our future strategy to be implemented more effectively.  For LeEco, this marks a second major setback to its ambition to become a major EV manufacturer after it recently pulled out of a joint project with British sports carmaker Aston Martin to develop RapidE electric car. FILE PHOTO: The front of a Faraday Future FF 91 electric car is shown during an unveiling event at CES in Las Vegas, Nevada January 3, 2017.Steve Marcus/File PhotoFaraday had initially planned to open the Las Vegas factory late in 2017, with a product portfolio of seven models - an estimate that was later slashed to two, including the FF 91. Jia, who posted the Faraday statement on his social media account, did not name the new FF 91 production location. Faraday will continue to own the Nevada factory site. The FF 91 has been described by its designer as  weird-pretty  and Faraday executives say it will be the most technologically advanced vehicle of its kind on the market when it goes into production in early 2018. But cash shortages have raised questions about the company's prospects. According to estimates from mutual fund investors, LeEco could see the market value of its listed unit, Leshi Internet Information & Technology Corp Beijing (300104.SZ), fall around $2.5 billion should its shares resume trading. The company is set to hold an extraordinary shareholders' meeting on July 17 in the Chinese city of Shenzhen.

Hit by massive cost overruns at its now bankrupt U.S. nuclear unit, Toshiba needs billions of dollars in fresh loans to tide it over before it can complete the $18 billion sale of the memory chip unit, which has currently stalled. Its banks, which include Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp and Mizuho Bank, had denied Toshiba access to an agreed commitment line of 680 billion yen earlier this year after its credit ratings were slashed due to writedowns for the nuclear unit, Westinghouse. Toshiba was allowed to withdraw 100 billion yen ($880 million) in loans late last month but must reseek permission every week from creditors to extend the loan, the sources said, declining to be identified as they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.  A Toshiba spokeswoman declined to comment. SMBC and Mizuho officials were not immediately available for comment.      Toshiba has told creditors it will need 1 trillion yen in fresh loans during the current financial year through March, banking sources have said previously. Western Digital Corp, Toshiba's joint venture partner for its flash memory chip business, is seeking a U.S. court injunction to stop any sale of the unit without its consent and is also opposed to the use of the unit's shares as collateral. After a long period of deliberation, Toshiba and its lenders concluded they can use the unit's shares as collateral even without Western Digital's consent, the sources said.

Low unemployment and generous, rising wages are a good start. There’s more to it, though. A government-backed study on Britain’s working practices published on Tuesday begins to ask the right questions about what the labour market should do – and how not to think about work. Britain’s workforce should be the envy of the modern world. Unemployment of 4.5 percent is about as low as it can possibly get in a rich country, and participation in the labour market is at a record high of almost 75 percent of the population. Wages in real terms are below where they were in 2008, but real disposable income has grown in all but three of the past 35 years. And the market is flexible: more than France and Germany, but less than the free-wheeling United States, where employees can be hired and fired at will. What raw statistics miss, though, is that not all jobs are the same. Wage data and employment numbers don’t say much about gruelling hours, intellectual pressure, lengthy travelling times or lack of status. RSA Chief Executive Matthew Taylor’s attempt to size up the state of British employment begins to address that, focusing on non-financial issues like security. While his review stops short of calling for a ban on “zero hours” contracts that guarantee no fixed amount of work, it does argue that sick pay and paternal leave should be offered to those who are effectively, if not technically, employees. Wages are just one of the six components of “good work” it identifies. That framework could go further. The truth is that some kinds of paid work come with conditions that make them little better than not having a job at all, while others appeal much more than pay levels would suggest. Developing countries have known this for decades: think of the challenge of rooting out sweatshops. Emerging markets also offer examples of the other extreme. In China last year, 1.5 million people sat the country’s civil service examination, competing for just 27,000 jobs. These roles are neither challenging nor lucrative, but they bring status, stability and mobility: a state job in Beijing gives an outsider coveted permission to live in the Chinese capital. If some jobs are as bad as none, aggregate data on how many people are in work becomes less useful. Again, China’s planners would say this is hardly news. Official unemployment in the People’s Republic has not risen above 4.3 percent in more than a decade. Yet the authorities worry constantly about disgruntled workers, and with good reason. India is in a similar situation. So, after the Brexit vote of last year, is Britain. The idea that governments should keep their hands off if wages and aggregate employment are rising is falling out of fashion. That’s because it is now clear that workers don’t always negotiate the best deal. In theory, a driver for car-hailing app Uber would calculate the minimum value of their time, add on a charge for the potential costs and risks they will incur, and refuse to work for less. If employers do not provide basic benefits, employees ought to demand more. That clearly doesn’t happen. Individuals tend to lack sufficient information to price risks properly, and would probably misjudge them even if they had better information. Any review of modern work needs to answer two questions: how to create more good jobs and how to measure them. This might need a nudge. Though Britain had its share of sweatshops and child labour, it also has a tradition of employers being surprisingly virtuous. The paternalistic capitalists of the Victorian era built towns and schools for their workers. More recently, Virgin founder Richard Branson said he would no longer keep track of how much time employees spent on holiday. Disruptive technology firms, and hard-edged American working cultures of the kind that saw maverick Uber chief Travis Kalanick fall on his sword, may require more coercion to do more than the legal minimum. Measuring whether new types of work are up to scratch poses an even bigger challenge for governments and economists. That calls for some new tools, such as better canvassing of workers’ feelings about what they do, or new definitions of pay that factor in a value for non-financial measures like holiday benefits or job security. The current practice of just counting employed people and what’s happening to their wages is no longer good enough.BreakingviewsReuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

Shares in the group, known for its trench coats lined in its camel, red and black check, topped the FTSE 100 index on Wednesday, as analysts said a 4 percent rise in like-for-like sales was double the expected rate. The stock was up 2.8 percent at 1,624 pence at 0841 GMT. Chief Financial Officer Julie Brown said Chinese consumer confidence had rebounded, resulting in stronger growth in mainland China and Hong Kong.  In Europe, Britain led the way, although growth has slowed as the group lapped the fallout from Britain's vote to leave the European Union last year, she said.  We continued to see strength in UK domestics and it even rose as we went through the quarter,  Brown said, contrasting with the somber mood of many mass-market retailers as consumer spending is squeezed by higher prices and subdued wages growth.   Customers responded positively to our new DK88 bag,  she said.  We continued to have great success with our new tropical gabardine trench coat, with models such as the Haughton selling out in some geographies.

Some investors have been unhappy about the pay of executives, including Brown and Bailey, who continues to be Burberry's creative driving force.

We are taking some time to assess options during the course of the next year or so,  she said. Burberry reported retail revenue of 478 million pounds  ($613 million) for the three months to the end of June. It said its guidance for full-year pretax profit was unchanged, although exchange rates were forecast to have a 25 million pound adverse impact, an improvement on its previous forecast of a 30 million pound hit.

A harsh recession which ended in 2014 saddled Italian banks with impaired debts that are still running at around 15 percent of total lending, three times the European average. Banks are under pressure by European banking regulators to cut their soured loans. In a speech to the Italian banking association, Bank of Italy Governor Ignazio Visco said bad loan data had improved thanks to regulatory demands but was still inadequate.  The quality of information (provided by banks), initially low, is improving ... (but) there are further margins for improvement,  he said. Poor data increase the risk for buyers of bad debts and widens a price gap that puts a brake on sales as banks can only sell at a loss. Visco said better quality data could help banks more actively manage doubtful loans before borrowers become insolvent so that they could either help them get back on their feet or, where necessary, raise provisions. Provisions on average cover 60 percent of the value of loans to insolvent borrowers while the coverage of so-called 'unlikely-to-pay' loans is lower.  Unlikely-to-pay loans account for half the value of impaired debts ... banks must intervene quickly with debt restructuring accords to return businesses to a sustainable track,  Visco said.

The biggest constraint on ratings is high and still-rising government debt levels, evident in both developed and emerging markets, leaving sovereigns exposed to a change in the global interest rate environment,  James McCormack, global head of Sovereign and Supranational Ratings at Fitch, said in a statement. bit.ly/2tM9i7e The ratings agency added that the rating outlook trend has turned positive in developing markets and expects the median emerging market current account deficit to improve slightly to 2.9 percent of GDP in 2017. The European political environment is also more settled than what it was at the start of the year. However, the beginning of the Brexit negotiations represents a material risk to the UK, Fitch said. Fitch also said that it expects primary fiscal balances of most countries to deteriorate, mainly due to the lower political support for additional fiscal tightening in developed markets. Fitch said earlier this week that cyclical pressures on banks in Asia-Pacific financial systems are beginning to ease due to global trade revival and a strong start to the year in China, while high debt remained a risk with the rise in U.S. interest rates expected to continue over the next few years. bit.ly/2sYXams Reporting by Kanishka Singh and Parikshit Mishra in Bengaluru; Editing by Amrutha Gayathri","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-fitch-sovereigncredit-idUSKBN19X120"},

My son is a high-quality person and I applaud his transparency,  Trump said in a brief statement read to reporters by White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders. Sanders told reporters that all other questions on the matter should be referred to either his son's lawyer or the president's outside counsel.

U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Moscow sought to hurt Clinton and help Trump in the 2016 presidential election. Sanders said Trump was  frustrated  by the focus on Russia.  The president is, I would say, frustrated with the process of the fact that this continues to be an issue, and he would love for us to be focused on things like ... the economy, on healthcare, on tax reform, on infrastructure,  Sanders said.

The emails, released by Donald Trump Jr., are the most concrete evidence yet that Trump campaign officials welcomed Russian help to win the election, a subject that has cast a cloud over Trump's presidency and spurred investigations by the Justice Department and Congress. The messages show that the younger Trump was open to the prospect of  very high level and sensitive information  from a Russian attorney that a go-between described as  part of Russia and its government's support for Mr. Trump  ahead of a meeting on June 9, 2016.   If it's what you say I love it,  Trump Jr. responded. He released the messages on Twitter after the New York Times said it planned to write about them and sought comment from him. (bit.ly/2uapeCK and bit.ly/2ua9hwg)     In an interview with Fox News, Trump Jr. said that Trump's campaign manager at the time, Paul Manafort, and son-in-law Jared Kushner, now a top White House adviser, also attended the meeting with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, who denies having Kremlin ties. He said Veselnitskaya did not provide any damaging information about Clinton at the meeting and instead sought to discuss Russian sanctions.  In retrospect, I probably would have done things a little differently,  he said.  For me, this was opposition research.  Nevertheless, the correspondence between him and Rob Goldstone, a publicist who arranged the meeting, could provide fodder for U.S. investigators probing whether Trump's campaign colluded with the Kremlin.  The crown prosecutor of Russia ... offered to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father,  Goldstone wrote Trump Jr. on June 3. Russia does not have a  crown prosecutor  - the equivalent title is prosecutor general.

The conversation will now turn to whether President Trump was personally involved or not. But the question of the campaign’s involvement appears settled now,  Cornell Law School professor Jens David Ohlin said in an interview.  The answer is yes.   Moscow has denied any interference, and Trump says his campaign did not collude with Russia. Trump Jr. said he did not tell his father about the meeting. He said he may have since had contact with other Russians. Part of an email conversation between Donald Trump Jr and publicist Rob Goldstone is seen in a Twitter message posted by Trump Jr. on July 11, 2017.  @DonaldJTrumpJR/Handout via REUTERS I've probably met with other people from Russia, but certainly not in the context of actual formalized meetings or anything,  he said on Fox News. Financial Markets Jolted The news jarred financial markets as investors worried it presented a fresh distraction from the administration’s economic agenda. Stocks and the dollar fell, while U.S. Treasury securities gained ground. Stocks later retraced most of their losses after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell pledged to keep lawmakers in Washington longer than scheduled to push through a bill to overhaul healthcare. Along with his younger brother Eric, Trump Jr. oversees the Trump Organization, his father's real-estate and business empire, and does not have a formal role in the White House. Slideshow (4 Images) My son is a high-quality person and I applaud his transparency,  Trump said in a statement. The White House referred questions to lawyers for Trump and his son. The emails do not appear to provide evidence of illegal activity, but legal experts say Trump Jr. could run into trouble if investigators find he aided a criminal action, such as hacking into Democratic computer networks, or violated campaign-finance laws by accepting gifts from foreign entities. He is likely to face scrutiny from both congressional committees investigating the matter.  The Senate Intelligence Committee plans to call on him to testify and to provide documents, according to a Senate source, while the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee wants to interview him and everybody else involved in the meeting, said the panel's top Democrat, Representative Adam Schiff.  The American people need to know that our president is acting on their behalf and not acting because he has a fear that the Russians could disclose things that would harm him or his family,  Schiff told reporters. On Fox News, Trump Jr. said he was  more than happy to cooperate with everyone.  Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley, a Republican, asked the Trump administration how Veselnitskaya was able to enter the United States even though her authorization had expired. CNN reported that Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is heading a criminal investigation at the Justice Department, also planned to look into the meeting. Vice President Mike Pence, who has said the campaign had no contacts with Russia, said through a spokesman he was not aware of the meeting, held before he became Trump's running mate later that summer. Senator Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican who is at times harshly critical of Trump, told reporters:  This is very problematic. We cannot allow foreign governments to reach out to anybody's campaign and say: 'We'd like to help you.'

An increasing number of companies in the digital space have exploited loopholes in the domestic tax system to minimize their tax liabilities, Sri Mulyani Indrawati said in a speech at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) conference in Jakarta. The corporate tax avoidance has put Indonesia's local businesses that comply with regulations at a competitive disadvantage, said Indrawati, who was previously a managing director at the World Bank and an executive director at the IMF.  Aggressive tax planning is part of MNCs' core business,  Indrawati said.  This is not good, not only for tax revenue but (also) injuring and damaging the sense of justice. And I know, coming back to Indonesia (from the World Bank), this is maybe the most important feeling that needs to be addressed,  she added. Indonesia's government has been pushing multinational technology firms to incorporate locally, arguing that the practice of setting up small business entities to provide  auxiliary  services allows them to get away with minimal taxation, while booking most of their revenue from the country elsewhere. Last month, Indonesian officials said Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google Asia Pacific headquarters had agreed on future tax payments after a months-long dispute with the government, paving the way for a shake up in the way similar firms operate in the country. Indonesia's Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati (L) shakes hands with with Malaysia's Deputy Minister of Finance Johari Abdul Ghani, as IMF Deputy Managing Director Mitsuhiro Furusawa (C) stands during the International Tax Conference in Jakarta, Indonesia, July 12, 2017.BeawihartaSeparately, the country's investment chief said last month social networking giant Facebook Inc (FB.O) was in the process of setting up a domestic unit in Indonesia. 'Unwanted Side Effects' IMF's deputy managing director said the expansion of economic integration and cross-border investment has produced some  unwanted side effects , including the  aggressive tax planning by multinational and regional companies.  The fund is working with countries to find ways to counter the artificial shifting of profits and assets to low-tax locations and to resist  damaging tax competition , Mitsuhiro Furusawa said in a speech at the IMF conference in Jakarta. Furusawa also said that in much of Asia, the tax-to-GDP ratio  consistently  falls below the 15 percent ratio  associated with a significant acceleration of growth and development.  Indrawati said that Indonesia's current tax-to-GDP ratio of 10.3 percent was  hard to swallow  and she is committed to raising that ratio to 16 percent by 2019.  It is a very ambitious target and I know my colleagues from IMF and World Bank both say it is impossible, so it is a challenge,  she said.  But I'm sure I love the challenge. If not I'd rather stay at the World Bank and do my old job,  she said.

The biggest constraint on ratings is high and still-rising government debt levels, evident in both developed and emerging markets, leaving sovereigns exposed to a change in the global interest rate environment,  James McCormack, global head of Sovereign and Supranational Ratings at Fitch, said in a statement. bit.ly/2tM9i7e The ratings agency added that the rating outlook trend has turned positive in developing markets and expects the median emerging market current account deficit to improve slightly to 2.9 percent of GDP in 2017. The European political environment is also more settled than what it was at the start of the year. However, the beginning of the Brexit negotiations represents a material risk to the UK, Fitch said. Fitch also said that it expects primary fiscal balances of most countries to deteriorate, mainly due to the lower political support for additional fiscal tightening in developed markets. Fitch said earlier this week that cyclical pressures on banks in Asia-Pacific financial systems are beginning to ease due to global trade revival and a strong start to the year in China, while high debt remained a risk with the rise in U.S. interest rates expected to continue over the next few years. bit.ly/2sYXams Reporting by Kanishka Singh and Parikshit Mishra in Bengaluru; Editing by Amrutha Gayathri","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/fitch-sovereigncredit-idUSL4N1K335W"},

Fitch has also put all the ratings on Watch Negative. Sunac's ratings have been downgraded to reflect the company's acquisitive business approach, which will make its financial profile more volatile. Current industry dynamics, where land bank expansion through project acquisition is prevalent, will likely drive Sunac to continue making acquisitions. As a result, leverage, as measured by net debt/adjusted inventory, is likely to be changeable, after it jumped to 60% by end-2016, from 26% and 19% at end-2015 and end-2014. Sunac's ratings are on Rating Watch Negative (RWN) because its plan to acquire Dalian Wanda Commercial Property Co. Ltd.'s (Wanda, BBB/Negative) assets will put pressure on Sunac's leverage over the next 12 months. The acquisition price, including debt to be acquired, according to our estimate using Wanda's publicly available 2016 financial reports, is almost as large as Sunac's net adjusted debt of CNY89 billion at end-2016. The acquisition, however, will enhance the business profile and profitability of Sunac's property development business, KEY RATING DRIVERS Acquisitive Business Approach: Sunac's financial profile has become less predictable as it continues to seek significant acquisitions to boost business scale and build its land bank. Sunac on 10 July 2017 agreed to acquire CNY63.17 billion of property assets from Wanda, after it purchased CNY14 billion of property assets from Legend Holdings in 2016. Prior to the planned Wanda acquisition Fitch expected Sunac in 2017 to bring down its high leverage. Moderation of Sunac's financial profile following acquisitions is now more uncertain in an environment where land bank expansion through project acquisition is widely practiced across the industry. Sunac's volatile financial profile, although in service of significant business scale growth, is no longer commensurate with a 'BB' rating. Mixed Impact from Wanda Deal: Fitch believes Sunac's homebuilding business will be strengthened by the Wanda deal and the pressure on Sunac's leverage will eventually ease over time. Under the agreement, Wanda will sell to Sunac a 91% stake in 13 Wanda City projects for CNY29.6 billion (including assumption of project debt) and 76 hotels for CNY33.6 billion. Both companies have agreed to finalise the terms of the transaction by 31 July 2017; and to complete the transactions, and asset and share transfers as early as practicable. This large acquisition by Sunac will have limited impact on its liquidity position, but will lead to a significant increase in its net debt position. This will, however, be mitigated by Sunac's slower land acquisition in 2017, the higher profit margin of the acquired Wanda City projects than Sunac's current portfolio, and possible faster pace of sales of the Wanda City projects. The transaction will cause a spike in Sunac's leverage in 2017 and possibly subsequent years, depending on the final terms of the transaction. No Benefit from Hotels Acquired: Sunac's acquisition of Wanda's hotel assets, however, will not bring immediate enhancement to Sunac's business profile nor financial profile, as the hotel business in China generally has a low return on investment because they are typically developed as part of larger mixed-use projects to get the approval of local governments. In addition, the EBITDA margin of these hotels is likely to be lower than that of Sunac's existing business. Diversification and Business Synergies: Sunac's property development business may benefit from this transaction with Wanda. The addition of the Wanda City land bank will increase by more than 80% Sunac's land bank of 50 million square metres (sqm) in attributable gross floor area (GFA) at end-2016, by our estimate. Sunac's geographical diversification will also improve as the majority of the Wanda City projects are in provincial capitals in new Tier 2 cities. Post-Acquisition Financial Profile: The resolution of the RWN will depend on whether this transaction is completed; and if it does, Sunac's financial profile in the 12 to 24 months following the completion of the transaction. The possible outcomes following the resolution of the RWN are discussed in the Rating Sensitivities. DERIVATION SUMMARY Sunac's homebuilding business scale, geographical diversification, project execution track record, and churn rates are comparable to Country Garden Holdings Co. Ltd. (BB+/Stable); and comparable or superior to Beijing Capital Development Holding (Group) Co., Ltd. (BBB-/Stable; standalone BB/Stable), and Guangzhou R&F; Properties Co. Ltd's (BB/Stable). However, Sunac has a more volatile financial profile than these companies. Its financial profile is more comparable with those of lower rated issuers like Greenland Holding Group Company Limited (BB/Negative, standalone BB-/Negative) and China Evergrande Group (B+/Stable); even though its 2016 leverage is lower than those of Greenland and Evergrande. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: - Sunac maintaining a land replenishment rate (GFA acquired/GFA sold) of around 1.5x-2.0x for long-term development - Margin pressure to increase from 2018 onwards, with EBITDA margin dropping to between 15% and 20% RATING SENSITIVITIES Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action; - If the transaction takes place and after reviewing transaction information, the ratings may be downgraded if net debt/adjusted inventory exceeds 50% on a sustained basis and attributable contracted sales/total adjusted debt falls below 0.8x on a sustained basis Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action; - If the transaction takes place and after reviewing transaction information, the ratings may be affirmed with a Negative Outlook if net debt/adjusted inventory exceeds 50% over the next 12 months but Fitch expects the ratio to be sustained below 50% thereafter - if transaction does not take place, the ratings may be affirmed with a Stable Outlook LIQUIDITY Liquidity Likely to Remain Adequate: Fitch believes Sunac has sufficient cash to pay for the Wanda deal following strong contracted sales in 1H17, when its attributable contracted sales rose by 107% to CNY75 billion. This will materially increase its end-2016 cash balance of CNY69 billion by end-June 2017.

The company, the East African country's biggest cement maker and controlled by Lafarge Holcim, began work on a new mill at its Athi River plant in January, with proper construction expected to start next month. The expansion will be carried out at a cost of 4 billion shillings ($38.52 million), Bamburi said in a statement. The firm posted a pretax profit of 8.27 billion shillings in 2016, up from 8.46 billion shillings a year earlier. Its second plant is located in the coastal city of Mombasa. With the announcement, Bamburi joins other Kenyan cement companies that are increasing their plant capacities. In February, ARM Cement said it planned to raise grinding capacity at its 1 million-tonne-a year plant by 50 percent in 12-14 months. Privately-owned Savannah Cement said in December that it would add a second grinding plant that would double its output capacity this year to 2.4 million tonnes annually. Latest data from the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics shows cement production rose 1.6 percent in the first quarter of this year to 1.6 million tonnes compared with the same period in 2016. Production rose to 6.71 million tonnes in 2016 from 6.35 million tonnes a year earlier, its data showed.

Djibouti's position on the northwestern edge of the Indian Ocean has fuelled worry in India that it would become another of China's  string of pearls  of military alliances and assets ringing India, including Bangladesh, Myanmar and Sri Lanka. China began construction of a logistics base in Djibouti last year. It will be used to resupply navy ships taking part in peacekeeping and humanitarian missions off the coasts of Yemen and Somalia, in particular. It will be China's first overseas naval base, though Beijing officially describes it as a logistics facility. State news agency Xinhua said late on Tuesday the ships had departed from Zhanjiang in southern China  to set up a support base in Djibouti . Navy commander Shen Jinlong  read an order on constructing the base in Djibouti , but the news agency did not say when the base would begin operations. Xinhua said the establishment of the base was a decision made by the two countries after  friendly negotiations, and accords with the common interest of the people from both sides .  The base will ensure China's performance of missions, such as escorting, peace-keeping and humanitarian aid in Africa and west Asia,  it said.  The base will also be conducive to overseas tasks including military cooperation, joint exercises, evacuating and protecting overseas Chinese and emergency rescue, as well as jointly maintaining security of international strategic seaways,  Xinhua said. Foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told a daily news briefing the base would enable China to make  new and greater contributions  to peace in Africa and the world and would benefit Djibouti's economic development.

The tiny, barren nation sandwiched between Ethiopia, Eritrea and Somalia also hosts U.S., Japanese and French bases. 'Not Military Expansionism' The People's Liberation Army Daily said in a front-page commentary the facility was a landmark that would increase China's ability to ensure global peace, especially because it had so many U.N. peacekeepers in Africa and was so involved in anti-piracy patrols. Soldiers of China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) salute from a ship sailing off from a military port in Zhanjiang, Guangdong province, July 11, 2017.StringerChina would not seek military expansionism or get into arms races no matter what happened, the newspaper said.  These promises will not change because of the construction of the overseas logistics base,  it said. The state-run Global Times said in an editorial there could be no mistake that this was in fact a military base.  Certainly this is the People's Liberation Army's first overseas base and we will base troops there. It's not a commercial resupply point. It makes sense there is attention on this from foreign public opinion,  said the paper, which is published by the official People's Daily. China's military development was about protecting its own security, it said.   It's not about seeking to control the world.  There has been persistent speculation in diplomatic circles that China would build other such bases, in Pakistan for example, but the government has dismissed this.

The pan-European STOXX 600 index was up 0.5 percent, as were the blue chips. Luxury goods group Burberry was a strong gainer, rising around 2.8 percent after reporting 3 percent underlying revenue growth in the first quarter, helped by robust demand in mainland China and continuing good performance in its British market.  (This is) the strongest performance for at least three years in terms of ... same store sales, and also the signs of an underlying rebound in demand in Mainland China are very, very promising,  Ken Odeluga, market analyst at City Index, said.

At the other end of the retail spectrum, discount store operator B&M; also rose 2.8 percent after issuing a trading update, in which it said that it was on track to achieve profit targets for the full year. Online retailer Zalando also saw strength in its shares after broker Societe Generale started its coverage of the stock with a  buy  rating, saying that it had the potential to play a much broader role in the future of fashion retailing. With the European second quarter results season just around the corner, expectations see earnings increasing by over 9 percent from the same period in 2016, which would be a rise of over 6 percent excluding the energy sector, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S estimates. Norwegian lender DNB led the banking sector higher, up more than 4 percent after its second-quarter earnings came in significantly above forecasts, helped by a rise in lending margins and lower losses on its portfolio. Strength in oil and metals prices helped lift the heavyweight European energy sector and basic resources , which both gained around 1 percent. The cyclical autos sector was led by a 2.2 percent rise in Valeo shares, which gained after the car parts maker said that it was eyeing a sale of a unit to Raicam. Education publisher Pearson continued its slide from the previous day when it announced plan to sell its stake in Penguin Random House, down around 4.7 percent as broker downgrades and cuts to estimates rolled in. Investec, Panmure and Credit Suisse were among brokers revising down their targets for Pearson, with worries around its dividend persisting.  We see some positives on the PRH exit, but are concerned by the new dividend guidance,  analysts at Investec said in a note.

However, this is partly mitigated by the region's high standard of living and robust manufacturing and agricultural sectors. In 2016, 20.1% of La Rioja's population was over 65 (19.5% in 2000), and the National Statistics Institute reported that the region's over 85 age group accounted for 3.7% of the total population, up from 2.2% in 2000. This trend is likely to continue and as a result, increase pressures on healthcare and social services. The Servicio Riojano de Salud healthcare autonomous body manages three public hospitals in the region, totalling around 867 beds. Its budget has expanded to EUR270 million in 2017 (EUR191 million in 2006) and represents 19% of La Rioja's budget. It employs 3.3% of workers in the region. Social spending has also increased to EUR152 million in 2017 (EUR74 million in 2006) and represents 10% of La Rioja's budget. The Department of Social Services finances 17 residences for the elderly with 1,306 beds, which does not sufficiently address the needs of the over 85 age group, which numbered 11,554 in 2016. For instance, the department finances a high 56% of the cost of a public residence managed directly by itself. La Rioja has a large number of small municipalities, which could add to spending pressure as La Rioja is responsible for providing financial and advisory support to municipalities on infrastructure maintenance and service provision. However, 62% of La Rioja's population lives in the Logrono metropolitan area, while 145 of its 174 municipalities have fewer than 1,000 inhabitants, resulting in efficient service provision. Since 1995, La Rioja's GDP per capita has been the sixth-highest among 17 Spanish regions and in 2016 was 7.2% above the national average. The structure of La Rioja's economy mirrors that of Spain, except for the stronger and broader industrial and agricultural sectors, accounting for 26% and 6% of regional GDP in 2016 respectively (16% and 2.3% for Spain). Under Fitch's base case, La Rioja's economy in real terms is likely to grow in line with Spain's 2.8% in 2017 and 2.3% in 2018, supported by private consumption and external factors. La Rioja's labour market shows stronger characteristics than the national average, while the historical gap with the latter has increased during the financial crisis years. Its employment rate was 51.2% in 2016 (47.6% in Spain), compared with 51.4% in 2010 (48.3% in Spain) and the regional's ongoing economic recovery should support job creation.

The manner of Fitch’s factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors.

The sisters won a number of doubles titles together before going their separate ways at the start of the year. The elder sibling, Yung-jan, teamed up with former women's singles champion and world number one Martina Hingis in February after the Swiss split from American Coco Vandeweghe after a short spell together.   The move reaped instant rewards as the pair won titles in Mallorca, Rome, Madrid and Indian Wells and played their first grand slam together at the French Open this year, reaching the semi-finals. They have continued their good form into Wimbledon where as third seeds they have beaten their three previous opponents without dropping a set and face Germany's Anna-Lena Groenefeld and Czech Kveta Peschke for a place in the last four.   It has not been so easy for Hao-ching and partner Monica Niculescu from Romania. The ninth seeds have had a tougher route to the quarters, having been taken to three sets in two of their encounters, and next face Catherine Bellis from the United States and Czech Marketa Vondrousova. Both sisters are hunting their first grand slam title, having previously gone close. The 27-year-old Yung-jan was twice runner-up at the Australian Open in the women's doubles, while Hao-ching, four years her junior, reached the mixed final at Wimbledon three years ago.

(Reuters) - Fethullah Gulen, the U.S.-based Muslim cleric accused by Turkey of instigating last year's failed coup, says he has no plans to flee the United States and would accept extradition if Washington agrees to a request by Ankara to hand him over. In an interview in his gated compound in Pennsylvania’s Pocono Mountains, Gulen, 79, denied a Turkish government allegation from February that he was preparing to leave for Canada to avoid extradition.  The rumors aren't true at all,  he told Reuters.  If the United States sees it appropriate to extradite me, I would leave (for Turkey),  he said, sitting in an ornate meeting room, its walls lined with Islamic scripture. President Tayyip Erdogan and the Turkish government accuse Gulen of orchestrating last July's attempted coup, in which rogue soldiers commandeered tanks and fighter jets, bombing parliament and trying to abduct or kill Erdogan. More than 240 people were killed in the violence. The Turkish Embassy in Washington declined to comment on Gulen's latest remarks. The White House did not respond immediately to requests for comment. Officials in Ankara could also not immediately be reached for comment. Erdogan said in May he would pursue  to the end  Turkey's demand for the extradition of Gulen, who denies any involvement in the coup attempt. But there has been little or no concrete progress on the Turkish request. U.S. officials have said privately that even though Erdogan has appealed directly to U.S. President Donald Trump on the matter, Turkey has yet to provide enough evidence for the Justice Department to act. The issue has been a major sticking point in the relationship between the two NATO allies. Gulen said he hoped that the Trump administration would not allow his extradition to move forward, especially after the resignation of former national security adviser Michael Flynn, a White House aide who quit just weeks after Trump's inauguration. Flynn, who resigned over his failure to disclose the extent of his contacts with Russia, had performed paid lobbying work that  could be construed to have principally benefited  the Turkish government, according to his lobbying registration filings, and was outspoken in favor of Gulen’s extradition. Gulen said he felt  pity  for Flynn but acknowledged that the former Trump aide's departure might have helped his case. The Justice Department declined to comment on the status of Turkey's extradition request. There was no immediate response from Flynn's lawyer to a request for comment.          U.S.-based Turkish cleric Fethullah Gulen at his home in Saylorsburg, Pennsylvania, U.S. July 10, 2017.Charles MostollerFrail Exile Gulen, a former Erdogan ally, has lived in self-imposed exile since 1999, presiding over what he says is a humanitarian religious movement. His followers operate a global network of schools and businesses that has been linked to the Gulenist movement. His network was declared a terrorist group by Turkey's national security council two months before the failed coup. Since then, Gulen himself has become an increasingly marginalized figure across the political spectrum. Following the putsch, a wide crackdown, which the government says is targeting Gulen's followers, has seen 50,000 people arrested and 150,000 state workers including teachers, judges and soldiers suspended under emergency rule.  Gulen denounced Erdogan's consolidation of power and the seizure of media outlets, comparing him to a  dictator.  He urged the Trump administration and European governments to do more to encourage the restoration of political freedoms in Turkey. Slideshow (5 Images) (If Erdogan hears) a strong voice from the United States or European Union, European Parliament, Brussels, saying: 'What you are doing is wrong ... your judicial system is not working,' then maybe he will change his mind,  the cleric said. European leaders have been critical of Erdogan's crackdown, but Washington has been more muted in its response. In a meeting in Washington in May, Trump made no mention of Erdogan's record on dissent and free speech. The Turkish government has repeatedly said its actions are justified by the gravity of the threat posed to the state by last year's coup, and rejected suggestions that it is clamping down on dissent.  The rule of law is upheld in Turkey, and it is not just about gaining more power or punishing the opposition,  Revza Kavakci Kan, deputy chair of Erdogan’s ruling AK Party, told a conference in Washington on Monday. Gulen praised the political opposition in Turkey and stressed that any fresh effort to remove Erdogan should be through peaceful protest and elections, not non-democratic means. His followers say his global movement - known as  Hizmet,  which means  service  in Turkish - seeks to spread a moderate brand of Islam, which promotes Western-style education, free markets and interfaith communication.  I have never supported a coup or an ouster,  he said. Today, Gulen is an isolated figure in Turkey, reviled by Erdogan's supporters but also shunned by much of the opposition, who see his network as having conspired over decades to undermine the secular foundations of the modern republic. Hundreds of thousands of opposition supporters took to the streets of Istanbul on Sunday to protest against Erdogan's crackdown, but there was no sign of sympathy for Gulen. Gulen appeared frail in the interview, walking with a shuffle, and keeping his longtime doctor close at hand.

Donald Keith, FTSE Russell's deputy chief executive, said last month's decision by rival index provider MSCI Inc to add a selection of mainland-listed China  A-shares  to its Emerging Markets Index has little impact on FTSE Russell's process.  A-share inclusion still divides international investors. The key thing for us is to go at the pace (they) want to go,  he told Reuters during a visit to Beijing last week. Key issues for foreign investors include restrictions on repatriation of funds, availability of derivative tools - such as futures - that would allow investors to hedge their risk, and widespread stock suspensions, Keith said. China's stock market crash of 2015, when more than 50 percent of mainland companies halted trading in their shares, shocked quite a lot of international investors, Keith said.  Inevitably there's a lag effect. It takes a while for that to wash through their collective memory.  Chinese companies, through offshore listings and foreign currency denominated  B  shares, already account for 24.7 percent of the FTSE Emerging All-Cap Index. Inclusion of  A  shares would initially raise that percentage to 28.4 percent. Keith estimates that about $30 billion has been deployed through various FTSE Russell China index products, which include a range of separate A-share indices, as well as an index tracking Chinese shares that can be traded through the Hong Kong-Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Connect schemes. Despite being cautious on adding A-shares to its Emerging Market Benchmark, FTSE Russell considers China to be of  key importance  and plans to build up its research and support staff in anticipation of continued market opening, Keith said.  He estimated the firm will increase related headcount over the next two years to as many as 25 people from about five currently.

As of end-June, there were 17 sovereigns on Negative Outlook and nine on Positive Outlook, a significant change from end-2016 - a record year for sovereign downgrades - when the Negative: Positive ratio was 26:5.  Factors that support the improvement in sovereign credit fundamentals include a synchronised pick-up in world GDP growth forecast for 2017 and 2018, a recovery in cross-border trade volumes, the stabilisation of commodity prices, albeit at a lower level, and a global macroeconomic policy backdrop that remains broadly accommodative,  said James McCormack, Global Head of Sovereign and Supranational Ratings at Fitch  The biggest constraint on ratings is high and still-rising government debt levels, evident in both developed and emerging markets, leaving sovereigns exposed to a change in the global interest rate environment,  McCormack added. The most notable improvement in emerging market sovereign credit profiles is in external finances. The median emerging market current account deficit is forecast to improve slightly to 2.9% of GDP this year versus 3.3% in 2016, and, on the back of strong capital inflows, foreign exchange reserves (excluding China) are projected to increase by about USD110 billion, the most since 2012. Unlike the 2013  taper tantrum , there has been no sign of disruption to emerging market capital flows associated with the Federal Reserve tightening, and Fitch does not expect any such disruption in the immediate term. A notable difference between 2013 and 2017 is the direction of change of 10-year US Treasury yields, which moved higher in 2013 and are currently on a slow downward trajectory. An eventual reversal in US yields, which is expected by Fitch as the relationship between real yields and real GDP growth normalises, would represent a risk to emerging markets' external funding conditions. In developed markets, the rating outlook trend has turned positive, based largely on country-specific developments rather than any common cross-regional improvement in sovereign creditworthiness. The European political environment is more settled than at the start of the year, and the short-term outlook is more benign, as existential questions surrounding the eurozone have become less urgent. Even so, higher-than-usual policy uncertainty remains in developed markets. It is still unclear whether Europe's political setting can deliver the much-needed structural reforms to support growth, Brexit negotiations have started and represent a material risk to the UK and - to a lesser degree - remaining EU member states, and changes to US tax and trade policies remain uncertain, as do the implications for US trade partners. Despite clear upward global growth momentum, most sovereigns are forecast to see deteriorations in their primary fiscal balances (balances excluding interest rates) in 2017 following four consecutive years of general improvements. This is attributed largely to waning political support for additional fiscal tightening in developed markets, and policymakers in a number of emerging market sovereigns still struggling to cope with the downward adjustment in commodity prices. The upshot is that more than one-in-five sovereigns will reach their highest level of government debt as a share of GDP this year (using the period 2000-2017 as the basis of comparison), and 40% will have done so since 2015.

Africa's second-largest copper producer, one of the continent's more stable democracies, has been unusually tense since the arrest in April of opposition leader Hakainde Hichilema on treason charges, ostensibly for impeding Lungu's motorcade. On Tuesday, parliament extended Lungu's emergency powers by three months in an attempt to quash a spate of arson attacks on market places and court-houses. Lungu spokesman Amos Chanda said police were making progress in their investigations and had observed no new incidents since emergency rule was imposed a week ago.  If these acts of sabotage do not continue this should be lifted within three months. It could be revoked even earlier than three months. The president at any point can revoke it,  Chanda said. Critics say the emergency powers will be used to harass political opponents after last year's bitter and violent election, which Hichilema's United Party for National Development (UPND) says was rigged.

Donald Keith, FTSE Russell's deputy chief executive, said last month's decision by rival index provider MSCI Inc to add a selection of mainland-listed China  A-shares  to its Emerging Markets Index has little impact on FTSE Russell's process.  A-share inclusion still divides international investors. The key thing for us is to go at the pace (they) want to go,  he told Reuters during a visit to Beijing last week. Key issues for foreign investors include restrictions on repatriation of funds, availability of derivative tools - such as futures - that would allow investors to hedge their risk, and widespread stock suspensions, Keith said. China's stock market crash of 2015, when more than 50 percent of mainland companies halted trading in their shares, shocked quite a lot of international investors, Keith said.  Inevitably there's a lag effect. It takes a while for that to wash through their collective memory.  Chinese companies, through offshore listings and foreign currency denominated  B  shares, already account for 24.7 percent of the FTSE Emerging All-Cap Index. Inclusion of  A  shares would initially raise that percentage to 28.4 percent. Keith estimates that about $30 billion has been deployed through various FTSE Russell China index products, which include a range of separate A-share indices, as well as an index tracking Chinese shares that can be traded through the Hong Kong-Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Connect schemes. Despite being cautious on adding A-shares to its Emerging Market Benchmark, FTSE Russell considers China to be of  key importance  and plans to build up its research and support staff in anticipation of continued market opening, Keith said.  He estimated the firm will increase related headcount over the next two years to as many as 25 people from about five currently.

Seven-times champion Federer faces last year's runner-up Milos Raonic in his quarter-final on Wednesday after defending champion Murray, who is chasing a third SW19 title, takes on big-serving American Sam Querrey for a place in the last four. Federer last won the title when he beat Murray in the 2012 final but the 35-year-old is favorite to claim a record 19th grand slam crown following his Australian Open triumph in January and subsequent decision to sit out the claycourt season. Home favorite Murray appears to be showing little sign of being slowed by a recent hip injury with the 30-year-old, who reached the semi-finals at the French Open in June, hitting form at just the right time on his favorite surface.  At the moment Federer's looking pretty good. I wouldn't rule Murray out though. I'd love to see that final,  Australia's Hewitt, who won the 2002 Wimbledon title, was quoted as saying by Sky Sports.  Murray and Federer are probably my two favorites at the moment.  Regarding the other six players still in the draw, Hewitt believes Croatia's Marin Cilic also has a chance to win the title and add to his U.S Open triumph of 2014.  He's won a grand slam. He will be nervous if he makes a semi-final against Andy but he has the kind of game... he's won (warmup event) Queen's before and plays well on this surface,  Hewitt added.

BMW said June sales of the 5 series were down 7.9 percent on the year at 27,595 cars, because of a lack of availability for a new long-wheelbase variant in China that is still in the launch phase and has not yet been rolled out to all showrooms.

Britain needs to build up to double the roughly 200,000 new properties arriving on the market each year just to meet pent up demand, which has pushed up prices and rents, stopping many younger people from getting onto the property ladder. Helped by the higher prices, Barratt posted a better than expected 12 percent rise in pretax profit for the year ended June 30 to 765 million pounds ($981 million). It built 17,395 homes during the period, up fractionally from the year before. But it said completions in London, where the housing shortage is particularly acute, dropped around 20 percent, after it slowed the pace of land buying in response to rising prices. Barratt has boosted output by more than 55 percent over the last six years to hit a nine-year high, but Chief Executive David Thomas said it also needed to focus on high standards.  We've got to ensure that the houses we're building are being built to the right quality and we're providing the right customer service,  he told Reuters. Rival Bovis is having to spend an additional 10.5 million pounds to deal with complaints after customers cited issues ranging from a lack of sealant in bathrooms to the heads of nails poking through walls. Like most of its peers, Barratt has booked record profits in recent years, benefiting from a surge in demand which has pushed the average selling price of its homes up 6 percent over the last year to around 275,000 pounds. The firm expects modest growth in volumes this financial year, but builders have consistently failed to plug a gap in volumes since the end of mass social housing programmes from the 1980s onwards. Over the last twelve months, Barratt said it bought land worth 957 million pounds, down 13 percent on the previous period, after it stopped purchasing land in the immediate aftermath of the EU referendum, but resumed shortly afterwards.  When you look at our sales trends, they have been very strong so we went back into the land market in September and we have very, very good momentum,  Thomas said. $1 = 0.7802 pounds Editing by Paul Sandle and Mark Potter","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/barratt-results-idUSL8N1K30V2"},

Blades has been trying to steer the company into calmer waters after it endured six profit warnings and four CEOs in the space of two years amid a decline in the company's primary energy markets. Late on Tuesday Bilfinger abandoned its target to improve its operating profitability this year after it made provisions of 55 million euros ($63 million) for projects taken on by its U.S. subsidiary Westcon in 2015 and 2016. They were approved just before Blades took over in July 2016. Blades said he believed Bilfinger was now through with reassessing the risks from old projects, although it could not be ruled out that fresh issues would arise. Bilfinger shares were down 2.34 percent at 33.58 euros by 0716 GMT, at the bottom of the German mid-cap index, having fallen to 33 euros in early trading.  Another setback!  a Frankfurt-based trader said in a note.  Restructuring will obviously take some time.  Blades, together with a new finance chief, has instituted new risk-management processes. He said the fresh provisions were for downstream petrochemicals projects that Westcon had embarked on in the southern United States after the oil price started falling. Bilfinger, once a storied name in German construction that was associated with the Munich Olympic stadium among other projects, lost out in a bet to focus on higher-margin services in the early years of this decade. Its main customers were energy utilities and petrochemical companies, which suffered badly and cut spending as the oil price went into decline.

The euro hit 14-month highs against the dollar as investors, already wary ahead of a speech by U.S. Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen, digested emails released by President Donald Trump's eldest son suggesting he welcomed Russia's help in last year's election campaign.  There's a little bit of nervousness in the market after the news overnight from the U.S. and ahead of the Yellen speech,  said DZ Bank strategist Christian Lenk.  Also it helps that yields are now at high levels, that might be driving some of the flows.  Yellen will be testifying to Congress on the state of the U.S. economy and markets will be watching the speech closely for any clues on rate hikes and the plan for reducing the Fed's balance sheet. While the most recent U.S. employment figures beat expectations, economic data from the world's biggest economy has been patchy this year and has generally been outperformed by the euro zone. On Tuesday, two of Yellen's colleagues cited low wage growth and muted inflation as reasons for caution on further interest rate increases. BBVA strategist Jaime Costero Denche said the tone Yellen adopts on inflation will be key; an upbeat assessment would imply that the world's most important central bank is primed to go ahead with unwinding post-crisis monetary stimulus. Higher-rated euro zone government bonds, which are considered amongst the safest financial assets in the world, were lower 1-2 basis points across the curve. The yield on Germany's 10-year government bond, the benchmark for the region, was 1.5 basis points lower at 0.545 percent. It is still over double the 0.25 percent level from two weeks ago, when European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi triggered a sharp sell-off in euro zone government bond markets by suggesting the bank was open to policy tweaks. Wednesday marks the first German auction of 10-year government bonds after this sell off, and as such markets will keep an eye on demand. A low bid-to-cover ratio could push yields higher.  This auction result is sure to find interest and interpretation in the market, and could move the bond prices,  said Lenk of DZ Bank.

Crude allocations to Asia for August will be reduced by about 200,000 bpd to 3.5 million bpd, while allocations to Europe will be down by around 70,000 bpd at 520,000 bpd. Oil majors were allocated some 200,000 bpd less in August at 780,000 bpd.  Exports to the United States will be below 800,000 bpd in August, the source said. Saudi Arabia told the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries its oil production in June rose to 10.07 million bpd, slightly above its OPEC target, mainly due to an increase in domestic crude burning for power during summer.  The source also cited late May port closures as pushing some cargoes into June, which may have resulted in higher June exports. The source said July oil output would be lower than June, without providing details.  Saudi Arabia is keen to see an improvement in the oil market and accelerate the balancing process, and expects other producers to do the same,  the Saudi source said, adding that there are signs of improvement in market fundamentals.  While supply is not increasing except from exempt countries such as Libya and Nigeria, demand is picking up and we are starting to see inventory draws in total petroleum stocks in recent weeks.  Saudi Arabia will continue to work closely with other producers to monitor and stabilize the market by making sure that production cuts are continuing,  the source said.  A joint ministerial committee from OPEC and non-OPEC countries including Saudi Arabia and Russia, the world's biggest oil producers, will meet on July 24 to discuss compliance with a supply-cut pact and review the rise in output from Nigeria and Libya. Both countries were exempted from the production cuts.  The Saudi source said ministers would discuss several ideas at the meeting and that the recent rise in output from Nigeria and Libya  is not big in a way that should disturb the market .  He declined to comment on further steps OPEC could take to rebalance the market.

The commission will include representatives from the judiciary, the head of parliament’s energy commission and of its planning and budget commission, speaker Ali Larijani said Wednesday, according to state media.  The South Pars project will cost up to $5 billion, including an initial stage of around $2 billion, and production is expected to start within 40 months, the oil ministry said this month. Total will be the project's operator with a 50.1 percent stake, Chinese state-owned oil and gas company CNPC will hold 30 percent, and National Iranian Oil Co subsidiary Petropars will have 19.9 percent. Production capacity is seen at 2 billion cubic feet per day, or 400,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day including condensate, Total said in a statement this month. The gas will supply the Iranian domestic market starting in 2021. The announcement of a commission followed a parliamentary session on Wednesday where oil minister Bijan Zanganeh spoke to MPs about the details of the project. Each year of delay in developing South Pars can cost Iran up to $5 billion, Zanganeh told parliament, according to oil ministry news agency SHANA.  He added that Iran has lost some $22 billion because of delays in developing South Pars.  Over the course of 20 years the field is expected to produce 335 billion cubic meters of natural gas as well as 290 million barrels of gas condensate, Zanganeh said, according to SHANA. The deal with Total increases Iran's energy security and is likely to encourage other foreign companies to invest in Iran, Zanganeh told parliament.

Kakuryu got off to a winning start in the 15-day meet at Aichi Prefectural Gymnasium but sustained a foot injury during his first loss of the tournament against second-ranked maegashira Hokutofuji on Tuesday.  Being prone to injury means he's losing power,  Izutsu was quoted as saying by Kyodo news agency.  If he can't win next time he steps on the dohyo, there will be no option to pull out midway. He would have to take the decision (to retire from the sport) as a man.  His right foot got worse Tuesday evening and he had difficulty walking this morning. I feel bad (for the fans) that he has had many withdrawals recently. Though it is not his fault, it happened because he's not strong enough,  Izutsu added. This was Kakuryu's third withdrawal from a tournament and he forfeited a bout in May with ankle pain. The wrestler, however, remained optimistic about his future.  I don't know what to say. I started on a good note so I don't know what went wrong,  he said.  I don't want to end with an injury this way, nor do I want to end as a loser.

The owner and operator of more than 900 pubs in Britain and Ireland said for the 11 weeks to July 9 2017 like-for-like sales increased by 5.3 percent. Chairman Tim Martin said:  Sales have been good in the last 11 weeks, probably helped by unusually good weather.  He also reiterated that the company expects that like-for-like sales of about 3 to 4 percent will be required to maintain profits at this year's levels in its next financial year. Like-for-like sales for the 50 weeks to July 9 edged up by 3.9 percent with total sales rising 1.9 percent. Wetherspoon's shares were up 1.7 percent at 1006 pence at 0712 GMT. Sales at the pub chain have held up despite signs from other British companies that rising inflation has forced consumers to cut spending. Investec, in a client note, said that despite the tough consumer backdrop, it believes JD Wetherspoon remains well positioned within the UK pub space, with its value proposition and well invested pub estate continuing to take market share.

The greenback edged 0.4 percent lower against the yen to 113.49 in early trades after rising more than 5 percent over the last month as traders played the diverging trends between a hawkish Fed and a dovish Bank of Japan.  The Yellen testimony remains the key event risk in today's session but we remain optimistic about the dollar's outlook and putting on a long position against sterling is the best way to execute that view,  said Adam Cole, head of FX strategy at RBC Capital Markets in London. Yellen will give her semi-annual monetary policy testimony before Congress later on Wednesday and on Thursday, and investors will be parsing it for clues on when the Fed will start reducing its massive balance sheet. The Fed raised rates last month to a range of 1 percent to 1.25 percent and market expectations are roughly of a 50 percent probability that interest rates will rise again before the end of the year, according to the CME's Fed watch data. While there is a 50 percent probability for the Bank of England to raise interest rates too before the end of the year, markets are expecting the central bank to strike a dovish stance after recent soft data and comments from policymakers. In an interview for a Scottish newspaper, the Press and Journal, published on Wednesday, Bank of England Deputy Governor Ben Broadbent said that while there was reason to see the bank moving towards higher rates, there were  a lot of imponderables . His comments pushed sterling to a two-week low against the dollar and to its lowest in eight months against the euro in early trading on Wednesday. Chris Turner, global head of strategy at ING, expects sterling to test support at 1.2750 if earnings disappoint. The Canadian dollar was slightly higher against its U.S. counterpart as investors awaited a Bank of Canada interest rate decision later on Wednesday.

Ophir also lowered its full-year production forecast, saying its Kerendan gas field in Indonesia ramped up at a slower-than-expected pace. Ophir cut full-year production forecast to 12,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd), and said production in the first half ended June 30 averaged at 11,300 boepd.

In the biggest shake-up of pensions regulation for decades, the so-called 'pension freedoms' allowed savers to access their pension pots early and removed the need to buy an annuity, or income for life. Interim findings by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) one year into its Retirement Outcomes Review said it had identified five issues, mostly around the issue of advice and competition. A final report is due in the first half of 2018. Accessing pension pots early has become the norm, it said, with most choosing to take their savings as a lump sum rather than a regular income, and with twice as many pots moving into so-called 'drawdown' funds, which allow a saver to take a regular income, than into annuities. Fifty three percent of pots accessed were fully withdrawn, although 90 percent of them were small, below 30,000 pounds ($38,000), and most of those doing so had other sources of income in addition to the state pension, the FCA said.  Since the introduction of the pension freedoms, the retirement income market has changed substantially,  said Christopher Woolard, the FCA's executive director of strategy and competition.  We have identified areas where early intervention may be needed either now or further down the track to put the market on the best footing for the future.  While 52 percent of fully withdrawn pots were reinvested somewhere else, savers may be paying too much tax, missing out on investment growth and other benefits, it said. Those who withdraw money early without taking advice typically followed the 'path of least resistance' and stuck with their current pension provider for a drawdown product without shopping around, it added. With some large pension providers pulling out of the annuity market, there was a risk of reduced competition over time, and product innovation was currently limited. As a result, the FCA said it would look at whether extra protections were needed for consumers who buy drawdown products without advice, whether consumers were paying too-high charges and if they ended up with unsuitable investment strategies. It would also look to improve competition in the non-advised drawdown market by asking the government to consider proposals to enable consumers to access their savings early without having to make a decision about the remainder of their pot. Consumers may also need better tools and services to help them better understand their options after the pension freedoms and improve trust in pensions, it said.

The dollar fell to a more than one-week low against a basket of major currencies, after U.S. President Donald Trump's eldest son released an email chain suggesting he welcomed Russia's help in last year's election campaign.     Workers also voted this week to approve a strike at a mine in Chile, following industrial disputes earlier in the year in Indonesia and at the world's biggest copper mine, also in Chile, that have whittled down copper supplies.      The short term fundamentals look supportive on the price where it is, but the more we move into the fall and the winter, we just don't think that the pace of the Chinese economy can sustain,  said analyst Dane Davis at Barclays in New York.        With the Chinese engaging in the policy of credit tightening and the real-estate sector starting to cool off, the evidence suggests you have a weakening in the market. Not a collapse, because the supply side is too tight, but a return to price around $2.50 (per pound, $5,500/tonne).       A weaker dollar typically draws interest for U.S. dollar-denominated commodities such as copper from investors outside the United States using other currencies.          FUNDAMENTALS     * LME COPPER: Three-month copper on the LME was up 0.3 percent at $5,895 a tonne by 0712 GMT, having earlier topped out at $5,920 a tonne, the highest since July 3. Copper prices have held below $6,000 a tonne since early March.     * SHFE COPPER: Shanghai Futures Exchange copper ended up 0.9 percent at 47,250 yuan ($6,959) a tonne.     * STEEL: SHFE zinc and nickel rallied more than 2 percent, tracking an uplift in steel amid higher profits at China's steel makers following closures of outdated capacity.      * STRIKE: Workers at the Zaldivar copper mine in Chile, owned by Antofagasta and Barrick Gold Corp, voted to approve a strike on Monday after talks with the company failed, a union leader told Reuters.     * FREEPORT: Indonesia says it will invite the head of mining giant Freeport McMoRan Inc to Jakarta this month to try to settle a long-running dispute over a new deal to operate the world's second-largest copper mine.      * CHINA CAR SALES: Vehicle sales rebounded in June, shaking off weakness in the previous two months.      * MARKETS NEWS: Asian shares gained on Wednesday after Wall Street managed to weather a fresh twist in the controversy over U.S. President Donald Trump's alleged connection with Russia, while investors looked ahead to Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen's comments.

The American stands two victories away a remarkable triumph and a win in Saturday's final would allow her to replace Serena, who is taking a break from tennis to give birth to her first child, as the oldest women's grand slam winner.  They're definitely here with me, for sure,  Williams told reporters on Tuesday.  Even if it's not physically. That is one thing I do know. They're fighting right alongside me.  In a professional career lasting more than two decades, Williams is closing in on a 50th WTA title and credits her longevity to a love of the game and a desire to constantly improve.  I love it,  Williams said.  I try really hard. There's no other explanation. You do your best while you can. That's what I'm doing.  I love the challenge. I love pressure. It's not always easy dealing with the pressure. There's constant pressure. It's only yourself who can have the answer for that.  I love the last day you play, you're still improving.

The Shenzhen-based insurer plans to use the acquired technology and know-how to grow its business in China, Jonathan Larsen, Ping An Group's chief innovation officer and chairman of the fund, told Reuters on Tuesday.  The primary rationale for the fund is strategic...to find capabilities, ideas, business models and technologies that can be valuable to Ping An,  he told Reuters on the sidelines of a conference in Hong Kong on Tuesday. Ping An launched the Hong Kong-based Global Voyager Fund in early May as the sole investor, but did not give details of which type of start-up companies it wanted to buy, or where it would look for assets.   The fund will allocate 30 percent of the capital to growth companies that are at least three years old and have been through the early-stage challenges, with a single investment size of $10 million to $30 million, Larsen said.  Another 30 percent will be deployed to bigger firms with a single investment size of between $30 million and $100 million, while a further eight to 10 percent will be invested in early-stage companies via partner funds.  The rest will be used for special investment opportunities such as buyouts, said Larsen, formerly the global head of retail banking and mortgages at Citigroup, who joined Ping An in May.  He added that although Ping An's customer franchise is overwhelmingly Chinese, the group may follow in the footsteps of the country's largest financial institutions.  We are at a point where we can very selectively contemplate international opportunities. And the fund could play a role in that mostly through partnerships,  he said.

The lenders were also chased for their valuations and solid fundamentals, Sun said, adding he expected them to continue to outperform. Small-caps steadied, but there were still 10 such firms slumping the 10 percent trading limit.

Very low global market volatility has also made buying options on the pound far cheaper than they were last year, when sharp price swings were the norm. GBP1MO=   The pound fell by as much as 20 percent in the aftermath of last year's shock vote to leave the European Union, trading as low as $1.15, but it has steadied in recent months and was trading at around $1.2906 on Tuesday.  However, there are still considerable nerves around the currency with surveys showing that major companies have curbed investment plans and consumers spent less on credit cards in anticipation of a rough economic period ahead. A threat by the Bank of England to raise interest rates is also broadly seen as reflecting concerns over the pound's value.  RBC strategists recommended a  short  sterling trade against the U.S. dollar this week, targeting $1.2635, while the latest Commodity Futures Trading Commission data for the week ending July 3 point to still sizeable short bets against the pound.

The Shenzhen-based insurer plans to use the acquired technology and know-how to grow its business in China, Jonathan Larsen, Ping An Group's chief innovation officer and chairman of the fund, told Reuters on Tuesday.  The primary rationale for the fund is strategic...to find capabilities, ideas, business models and technologies that can be valuable to Ping An,  he told Reuters on the sidelines of a conference in Hong Kong on Tuesday. Ping An launched the Hong Kong-based Global Voyager Fund in early May as the sole investor, but did not give details of which type of start-up companies it wanted to buy, or where it would look for assets.   The fund will allocate 30 percent of the capital to growth companies that are at least three years old and have been through the early-stage challenges, with a single investment size of $10 million to $30 million, Larsen said.  Another 30 percent will be deployed to bigger firms with a single investment size of between $30 million and $100 million, while a further eight to 10 percent will be invested in early-stage companies via partner funds.  The rest will be used for special investment opportunities such as buyouts, said Larsen, formerly the global head of retail banking and mortgages at Citigroup, who joined Ping An in May.  He added that although Ping An's customer franchise is overwhelmingly Chinese, the group may follow in the footsteps of the country's largest financial institutions.  We are at a point where we can very selectively contemplate international opportunities. And the fund could play a role in that mostly through partnerships,  he said.

The survey of 60 economists suggested government efforts to flush out property speculators, defuse asset bubbles and reduce high levels of debt across the economy will continue to chip away at growth from the first quarter's robust pace of 6.9 percent.   While policymakers are treading cautiously ahead of a key party meeting later this year, analysts say that weaning China off its dependence on years of cheap money may pose a threat to the economy if not handled well - especially as rising borrowing costs risk depressing investment and confidence.  Just the same, the broad consensus is that the economy is entering a period of a gradual deceleration rather than a sharp downturn. And, solid exports could help cushion the impact from the deleveraging drive, economists said.  The economy could slow due to combined effects of property controls and the develeraging push, but we don't expect a significant slowdown as exports improve,  said Tang Jianwei, senior economist at Bank of Communications in Shanghai. A surprisingly upbeat gross domestic product reading would likely lift stocks and global commodity prices, but a weak outcome could boost bearish bests on the yuan, which has gained about 2 percent against the dollar so far this year. Economists in the poll estimated GDP grew 1.7 percentquarter-on-quarter, versus 1.3 percent in the first quarter, though only 17 analysts gave sequential forecasts. The first-quarter growth of 6.9 percent was the fastest in six quarters, driven by strong government infrastructure spending and a gravity-defying property boom. Investment Risk In an environment of tightening financial conditions, economists say investment - a vital growth engine - may take a hit and put the brakes on growth.   Zhu Baoliang, chief economist at the State Information Centre, a government think-tank, told the official Financial  News this week that he expected China's growth to slow to 6.6 percent in the third quarter and 6.4 percent in the fourth. Still, Zhu tipped the economy to grow 6.7 percent this year, ahead of the government's target of around 6.5 percent. Moody's Investors Service downgraded its credit rating in May, saying it expects the country's financial strength will erode in coming years as growth slows and debt continues to rise. China will release second-quarter GDP on July 17, along with June industrial output, retail sales and fixed asset investment.  June trade figures will be issued on Thursday, with exports seen up 8.7 percent last month from a year earlier - matching that of May, according to a separate Reuters poll.     Tightening Conditions    The People's Bank of China (PBOC) shifted to a modest tightening bias at the start of this year, guiding market interest rates higher during the first quarter, including immediately after the U.S. Federal Reserve raised rates in March. But the PBOC injected substantial liquidity last month to help avoid an end-quarter cash crunch as Beijing tightened regulations to force banks to deleverage. Indeed, policy insiders expect the central bank to hold off on further tightening and could even slightly loosen its grip in the coming months to support growth.  We’ve penciled in cooling growth in Chinese demand over the second half of the year,  said Qu Hongbin, HSBC chief economist for China.  Much depends, however, on how hard China’s central bank will keep pressing the brakes: it seems unlikely it’ll want to derail growth entirely.” Additional reporting by Shaloo Shrivastava in Bengaluru; Editing by Shri Navaratnam","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-economy-gdp-idUSKBN19X0MY"},

As cities become more congested, the direct and indirect costs of parking are a headache for motorists and policy makers, who often have conflicting goals. Drivers want cheap, plentiful parking while governments in many large cities want to discourage vehicle traffic, reduce congestion and cut the air pollution generated as cars hunt for on- or off-street parking. Automakers and technology companies, meanwhile, hope to profit from guiding motorists more smoothly into parking spaces using smartphone apps or technology that automates parking maneuvers. Closely held INRIX of Kirkland, Washington provides traffic data to parking services and automakers and owns the parking reservation app ParkMe. The study of parking costs was based on information from the company's parking database and survey responses from 18,000 drivers in 30 cities in Britain, Germany and the United States, the company said. The study concluded that in the United States, the average driver overpays for parking by $97 a year by buying more time than needed while average parking ticket costs are $12 a year. INRIX estimates that searching for a parking space in major U.S. cities costs motorists an average of $345 a year in lost time and wasted fuel. In the UK, motorists pay for excess parking time by an average of 209 pounds ($269), although average parking ticket costs are 39 pounds a year, the study found. The search for parking consumes time and fuel valued at 733 pounds. In Germany, INRIX estimates motorists pay 98 euros ($112) more than needed for their parking, to avoid an average 8 euros in parking fines. Germans waste an average 896 euros a year hunting for places, the study found. INRIX found that fewer than 10 percent of respondents in the three countries used one of many smartphone apps designed to help motorists find, reserve and pay for a space in advance of using it. Asked what they would pay for  smart parking  technology, INRIX said 43 percent of respondents said nothing.

Poloz,CANADA,CENBANK/RATES (REPEAT),Americas,Inflation,Central Banks / Central Bank Events,Corporate Events,Interest Rates / Policy,Economic Events,Bank of Canada,Monetary / Fiscal Policy / Policy Makers,Canada","sector":"Markets","content":"(Repeats Tuesday story with no changes) By Andrea Hopkins OTTAWA, July 11 (Reuters) - The Bank of Canada is widely expected to raise interest rates on Wednesday for the first time in nearly seven years, following the Federal Reserve in a bid to inch rates back towards normal after the global financial crisis a decade ago. The move, considered unlikely as recently as six weeks ago, would make Canada the first major central bank to follow the U.S. central bank in removing the monetary stimulus poured into the global economy in the wake of the 2008 credit crisis. The bid by Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz to move rates from near-historic lows of 0.50 percent is hotly debated, with the nation facing stronger economic growth but also a cooling housing market, little inflation, and uncertainty about its trade with an increasingly protectionist United States.  Initiating a hiking cycle when core inflation is running at 1.3 percent ... would probably grant Governor Poloz the title of being the most hawkish Bank of Canada governor during the inflation targeting regime,  economists at TD Securities wrote in a research note. Market-watchers have scrambled in recent days to keep up with the increasingly hawkish tone from Poloz, who has signaled a desire to reverse two rate cuts made in 2015 to counter low oil prices. The likely hike comes as central banks are looking to lift rates to give themselves ammunition to fight the next downturn, said Brett Ryan, senior U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank, who expects the bank to wait until October to hike.  The bottom line is we're moving away from crisis-type levels of monetary policy because it's no longer warranted,  Ryan said.  It doesn't mean we're going to yank the punch bowl away, it's just it's time to start taking our foot off the accelerator.  The Fed has hiked rates three times in the last eight months and four times since 2015. While other central banks are not yet tightening, Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said in late June a rate hike was probably necessary and the bank would debate it in the coming months. Analysts said following the Fed provides a degree of safety.  Absolutely we are insulated, since the huge neighbor to the south has already done so,  said James Laird, president of CanWise Financial.  It doesn't change the spread tomorrow - they (the Fed) are still significantly higher and they still moved before we did.  A rate increase would be the first by Poloz, who took over at the helm of the bank in 2013 after his predecessor Carney went to the Bank of England. The Bank of Canada cut rates eight times under Carney during the financial crisis before hiking three times in 2010 in an aborted attempt to wean the economy off cheap money before the oil crisis forced a return to easing.

However, it said price controls need to evolve to meet the changing needs of an energy system where renewable energy, for example, now accounts for 24 percent of capacity, compared to 5 percent 10 years ago.  Ofgem is signalling today that companies need to prepare themselves for a tougher round of price controls from 2021,  the regulator said in a statement.  This is in line with other utility regulators, as there is clear evidence pointing towards the cost of investment required for networks (cost of capital) being significantly lower,  it added.

It said there were suspicions that those killed may have been planning to target events being held this week to commemorate the first anniversary of an attempted military coup in Turkey on July 15. The operation was launched as part of security measures to protect buildings along routes used by military vehicles and the raid on the house was launched in search of a wanted Islamic State militant, the Konya governor's office statement said. A gunfight broke out after those in the house resisted the police and five Kalashnikov rifles, a pistol and ammunition were seized during the raid, it added. Work was continuing to identify those killed. Police sealed off the area and approaching vehicles were searched after the clash, which occurred during raids conducted by the police on 10 different addresses in Konya, Dogan said. Islamic State militants have in the past carried out gun and bomb attacks in Turkey. Many foreign fighters have also passed through Turkey in recent years on their way to join the jihadist group in their self-proclaimed caliphate in Syria and Iraq. Ankara has detained more than 5,000 Islamic State suspects and deported some 3,290 foreign militants from 95 different countries in recent years, according to Turkish officials.

Horn stunned Pacquiao with an unanimous 12-round decision on July 2 that gave the former schoolteacher the WBO welterweight title. There had been talk the 38-year-old Pacquiao might retire, but the eight-division world champion said on Wednesday his passion for the sport was still strong.  I love this sport and until the passion is gone, I will continue to fight for God, my family, my fans and my country,  Pacquiao said on his Twitter feed. A rematch was written into the contract for the initial fight in the event Pacquiao lost and the pair are expected to face each other again later this year. Pacquiao's defeat sparked fury among his fans, who labeled the 117-111, 115-113 and 115-113 scoring as a  hometown decision , and the Philippines Games and Amusements Board sent a letter to the WBO asking for a  thorough review  of the fight. On Tuesday, the WBO said five independent judges had reviewed the bout and gave the decision to Horn by seven rounds to five.. Pacquiao said in a statement to CNN Philippines late on Tuesday in reaction to the WBO's review that, in his opinion, it was clear who won.  Let the people judge for themselves. People saw what happened,  he said.  We have seen worse judgments in the past where judges manipulated results.  Nothing surprises me now.

State investor Temasek sold more assets last year than it bought, its annual report published on Tuesday showed. It is the first time the equity-focused investor has made a net divestment since 2009. With stock market valuations high and stiff competition for assets, this trend looks set to continue.  Temasek’s portfolio is bigger than ever, the value of its assets stood at S$275 billion ($199 billion) at the end of March. The fund delivered an impressive 13.4 percent total return over the year. A global stock market rally helped, as did cashing in on some S$18 billion of investments.  But new investments during the year dropped to S$16 billion, around half the level of the previous year. Temasek does not break down the pure cash component of its portfolio. But a two percentage point increase to 33 percent in the portion of assets the fund partially defines as liquid suggests that dollars may be starting to accumulate. That means replicating this year's solid returns is going to be tough. For a start, valuations for listed companies are stretched. The MSCI All Country World Index is trading at 15.8 times forward earnings, a multiple close to the 11 year high which it hit in 2015, Thomson Reuters data shows. Another problem is that rival investors are awash with cash too. Private equity funds are already struggling to find a good home for their own investors' money; these players had a mammoth $842 billion available for investment as of March 2017, according to alternative assets research firm Preqin.  Graphic: Valuations for global stocks are rising: reut.rs/2tGQo3d Given the fund's cautious outlook for the year ahead, Temasek's garage sale may continue. High valuations might help to keep up returns but it will also ensure deploying capital is a difficult affair.

The currencies of South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand all posted their biggest intraday percentage gains in at least a month as investors pared their greenback positions, although the Philippine peso hovered just above a record low it hit on Tuesday on concerns about the country's trade deficit.        Emails from the U.S. president's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., showed he agreed to take Russian help to find damaging evidence against rival candidate Hillary Clinton during the presidential race last year.     This comes right before the Yellen's much-awaited address where she is expected to shed some light on the pace of tightening after Fed Governor Lael Brainard's comments on Tuesday disappointed some dollar bulls.      The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against six major rivals, was 0.09 percent lower at 95.580 at 0540 GMT.      Markets are mulling the fairly subdued FOMC tightening theme ahead of Yellen's speech and I think that this corresponds to softer yields also giving rise to some of the pulls that we see in these currencies,  said  Vishnu Varathan, head of economics and strategy at Mizuho Bank in Singapore.      The reallocation out of the dollar... has benefited some of the low yielding Asian currencies because they are deemed to be a hedge position.      Such currencies include the Taiwan dollar, the South Korean won and to an extent the Singapore dollar, he says, as they have much lower interest rates and correspondingly low yields.     The South Korean won was up as much as 0.6 percent, its biggest intraday percentage gain in more than 1 month.     The Taiwan dollar and the Thai baht followed, each rising 0.4 percent. The baht snapped six losing session and hit its biggest intraday percent gain in a month, while the Taiwan dollar gained its most in a day since late May 22.     The Singapore dollar was up 0.1 percent. Data showed that Singapore retail sales for May rose 0.9 percent from a year earlier.     The Malaysian ringgit was up 0.06 percent, little moved by domestic industrial production for May, which rose 4.6 percent from a year earlier.              PHILIPPINE PESO     The peso bucked the trend for the day, falling 0.14 percent from its previous close after hitting its lowest since 2006 in its previous session as data showed that Philippines posted its widest trade deficit in decades in May.      Joey Cuyegkeng, Senior Economist, Asia at ING said while the widening trade deficit can be viewed as positive from a domestic demand perspective, the currency may weaken further in the near-term owing to a further widening in the deficit.       From a currency stand point, until investors feel that imports work through the economy and push it to a higher growth path, then the market focus would be on the near term impact of a deterioration in balance of trade through a weaker exchange rate,  Cuyegkeng said.     Investors will now be looking at the next remittance report he says, for an indication on whether structural inflows can mitigate the deterioration in the trade balance.

However, Valeo said the European Commission had since expressed doubts on competition within that particular market, leading to its decision to seek the sales deal with Raicam.

The company, which provides electronic trading platforms for banks, asset managers, hedge funds and companies, posted a 10 percent increase in revenue for the three months to June, once currency fluctuations are stripped out. NEX, which was known as ICAP until the sale of its voice broking business to TP ICAP last year, said trading activity at its NEX Markets unit was held back by low volatility, with episodes of increased activity around the French election and a U.S. rate rise. The unit, which provides foreign exchange and fixed income electronic trading technology and services via its EBS and BrokerTec platforms, delivered 11 percent revenue growth on a constant currency basis, while reported revenue rose 20 percent in the quarter. Average daily volumes on EBS - a platform where banks and other major institutions trade the euro, yen and Swiss franc against the dollar - were down 3 percent to $80 billion since the start of the year. NEX said FX volatility had  waned  since the start of 2017, especially in G3 currency pairs - the U.S. dollar, euro, and Japanese yen- despite the Federal Reserve increasing rates. NEX said in May that trading activity since the start of the year had remained subdued, with financial market volatility falling to historic lows in recent months, despite global and political uncertainty. The company gave a cautious assessment of its 2017 prospects in February, with muted January trading volumes casting a shadow over better than expected third-quarter revenue. Trading platforms had benefited from increased market activity after unexpected political news last year such as Donald Trump's U.S. election victory and Britain's vote to leave the European Union, but the volatility caused by those events has been short lived.

The 10-year cash JGB yield                was flat on the day at 0.090 percent, while the September 10-year JGB futures contract          finished up 0.10 point at 149.88.          In the superlong zone, the 20-year JGB yield                fell one basis point to 0.625 percent, while the 30-year JGB yield                also fell one basis point at 0.895 percent.     The 5-year JGB yield               was flat on the day at minus 0.040 percent. The five-year yield on Monday rose to minus 0.035 percent, its highest rate in nearly 1-1/2-years.     The BOJ offered to buy 330 billion yen ($2.90 billion) of JGBs in the three- to five-year zone on Wednesday, up from 300 billion yen at its previous purchase operations.     While the central bank does not have an explicit target for the five-year yield, it aims to keep the benchmark 10-year yield  around zero percent  even as it has come under upward pressure from rising global yields.

The Nikkei shed 0.5 percent to 20,098.38, and the broader Topix dropped 0.5 percent to 1,619.34. Trading was subdued, with investors looking ahead to U.S. monetary policy clues from Yellen's testimony to Congress later in the day. The Topix's turnover was 1.98 trillion yen, the lowest since June 26.  Global investors have adjusted their positions before the event,  said Chihiro Ohta, general manager of investment research at SMBC Nikko Securities. Exporters, which gained over the past few days on hopes for better earnings thanks to a weaker yen, lost ground on profit-taking. Advantest Corp dropped 0.6 percent, TDK Corp declined 1.3 percent and Toyota Motor Corp lost 0.6 percent after the dollar slipped 0.4 percent to 113.48 yen, moving away from a four-month high of 114.495 yen on Tuesday. On Tuesday, Wall Street was roiled briefly after emails disclosed Trump's eldest son welcomed help from a Russian lawyer for his father's 2016 election campaign against Hillary Clinton. Japanese analysts said the impact from the political turmoil in Washington on the Japanese stock market was limited. Some Tokyo stocks were in the spotlight on individual news. Women's wear company Honeys Holdings soared 9.3 percent and was the seventh biggest gainer on the board after it forecast a 30.5 percent increase in operating profit for the year through March 2018. But Sapporo Holdings dropped 3.2 percent after the Nikkei business daily reported that the brewer's January-June operating profit likely was a little bit over 3 billion yen, falling short of about 4 billion yen that the market has expected.

The Australian benchmark index finished at its lowest level since June 21, down about 1 percent at 5,673.8. Markets will closely watch Yellen's comments before the House Financial Services Committee for clues on the pace of U.S. monetary policy tightening, though no major changes to the policy outlook are expected. Investors are also lying low ahead of major U.S. second quarter earnings reports later this week with big banks, including JP Morgan Chase, Wells Fargo, and Citigroup, due to report on Friday. Financial stocks were the biggest losers on the benchmark with the big banks shedding in a range of 1 percent to 1.5 percent. Healthcare stocks too were among the top decliners with CSL Ltd, a sector heavyweight, posting a 2.5 percent loss. The basic materials sector was the only one to gain with its miners supported by an uptick in commodity prices. Big miners BHP, Rio Tinto, and Fortescue added in a range of 0.1 percent to 0.8 percent, helped by a surge in iron ore and base metals prices. New Zealand's benchmark S&P;/NZX 50 index finished 0.6 percent lower at 7,586.02.

Faraday is part of a network of young electric vehicle (EV) firms in China and the United States backed by Jia, who has said his company LeEco - that grew from a Netflix-like video website to a business empire spanning consumer electronics to cars within 13 years - is facing a severe shortage of cash after expanding too fast and in too many directions. Struggling to support goals that included beating Elon Musk's Tesla Motors in premium EV making, Jia is now trying to ride out the cash crunch by taking measures such as halting work on the Las Vegas factory and selling a Silicon Valley property less than a year after buying it from Yahoo Inc . On the decision to shift the production site of Faraday's luxury electric SUV FF 91 to a new site, the startup said:  This will allow product production to be realized faster, as well as allow our future strategy to be implemented more effectively.  Jia, who posted this Faraday statement on his social media account, did not name the location of the new FF 91 factory. The FF 91 has been described by its designer as  weird-pretty  and Faraday executives say it will be the most technologically advanced vehicle of its kind on the market when it goes into production in early 2018. But cash shortages have raised questions about the company's prospects. According to estimates from mutual fund investors, LeEco could see the market value of its listed unit, Leshi Internet Information & Technology Corp Beijing, fall around $2.5 billion should its shares resume trading. The company is set to hold an extraordinary shareholders' meeting on July 17 in the Chinese city of Shenzhen.

The loan sale - representing about seven percent of the bank's $39 billion offshore assets - comes as Chinese regulators move to reduce leverage and control potential systemic risk, including problems posed by domestic companies acquiring overseas assets. Hong Kong based CITIC Bank International has put 51 Asia offshore loans up for sale, most of which were made to companies based in mainland China, Basis Point reported, citing people with direct knowledge of the matter and a sale document. The loans are largely denominated in U.S. and Hong Kong dollars, maturing between 2017 to 2021. The largest loan up for sale is a $600 million chunk of a $12.7 billion syndicated financing facility backing China National Chemical Corp’s (ChemChina) $44 billion acquisition of pesticides and seeds group Syngenta AG, according the document and the sources, Basis Point said. CITIC Bank International, together with its parent China CITIC Bank, was the global coordinator and largest lender of the facility. The bank is also selling a HK$4 billion ($512 million) portion of a loan used to finance Hong Kong-listed Goldin Properties Holdings Ltd's take-private, HK$2 billion of lending to debt-laden property developer China Evergrande Group and $30 million to acquisitive Chinese conglomerate Fosun, according to the document and sources.  Basis Point was not able to ascertain the reason for the sale but banks typically offload portfolios in the secondary market to reduce credit and liquidity risk. Bankers in receipt of the sale document said the $2.8 billion portfolio was unusually large for the Asian secondary loan market. A Hong Kong-based spokesman for CITIC Bank International declined to comment. Scaling Back The Chinese banking regulator is cracking down following years of aggressive lending by Chinese banks, particularly to finance overseas acquisitions. Chinese firms spent a record $221 billion on assets overseas in 2016, ranging from movie studios to football clubs.  Chinese banks' share of the Asia ex-Japan market in syndicated loans, usually used to fund acquisitions, was more than a third last year compared to about 14 percent in 2013, according to Thomson Reuters LPC data. Last month, China's banking regulator ordered a group of lenders to assess their exposure to offshore acquisitions by HNA Group, Dalian Wanda Group Co, Anbang Insurance Group, and Fosun, Reuters reported, without naming the banks. Several Chinese loan bankers said they were also looking to deleverage their portfolio and would be selective in lending in the second half of 2017.  We have been asked to tighten our lending in the second half after making so many loans in the past few years,  one Hong Kong-based senior loan banker told Basis Point.

The CMA said other concerns were raised and considered in the phase 1 probe, opened in May, but it had not found it necessary to conclude on all of these given the referral.

The Outlook is Stable. KEY RATING DRIVERS Strong Linkages with Parent: SIC is rated one notch down from 55.76% parent Sinochem Group, which is in turn rated two notches lower than China's sovereign ratings (A+/Stable) - in line with Fitch's parent and subsidiary rating criteria. SIC is the most important branch for the group's chemical segment - representing approximately 50% of revenue and a 90% net profit contribution to the group's chemical segment in 2016. Sinochem Group's chemical business is one of the five major operating segments of the group. SIC is also the only subsidiary within the group for crop protection sales and production, natural rubber, rubber chemical and chemical logistics, all of which have strong operational and strategic ties with the state. Global Leader in Natural Rubber: SIC's acquisition of Halcyon Agri Corp (Halcyon), a Singapore-based natural rubber supplier, and the restructuring of existing SIC rubber assets into Halcyon, would make the company the world's largest supplier of natural rubber. It would have 35 facilities across Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, China and Africa combined with a leading global distribution network and total annual processing capacity exceeding 1,400,000 tons. Fitch believes that Halcyon will not only diversify SIC's natural rubber production/processing capabilities but also secure additional plantations across different geographic regions. Strong Ties with Agro-Chemical: SIC has close operational and strategic ties with the state, reflected by its participation into government-assigned tasks and active engagement in the industry consolidation with a view to enhance the weak domestic sector. Furthermore, SIC is the largest entity for the group's agro-chemical business, being the only subsidiary owning the operations for agrochemical sales and production. This segment is an indispensable part of the group's strategy to become a vertically integrated agriculture corporation, with business coverage from seeds to fertilizer and agro-chemical. Its linkage is further enhanced by the group's intention to build SIC as the only agro-chemical platform by investing in more R&D; in the future. Dominant in Rubber Anti-Degradants: SIC has a global market share of over 40% for PPD, a major rubber anti-degradant in China, through its 61%-owned subsidiary Jiangsu Sinorgchem Technology Co., Ltd (Sinorgchem). Sinorgchem's leading market position is supported by high barriers to entry in terms of industry experience and intellectual property. Sinorgchem and Solutia Inc. are the only two companies on a global scale owning the entire intellectual property rights for producing 4-ADPA, a chemical intermediate to produce rubber anti-degradants. China's Largest Chemical Logistics Provider: SIC is the largest international standardised liquid chemical products logistics provider in China, controlling a fleet of 73 tankers with a capacity of over 1,230,900 tons. It is also the largest government-assigned logistics provider for dangerous liquid chemical products, and the only shipping company to deliver TDI/MDI and other high-end and dangerous liquid chemical products. Moreover, its strong operational ties with the state are reflected by its participation in the national standards drafting assigned by the Ministry of Transportation. DERIVATION SUMMARY SIC's ratings are comparable with that of fellow Sinochem Group subsidiary Sinofert Holdings Limited (BBB+/Stable), which is rated top down one notch from Sinochem Hong Kong Group) Company Limited (A-/Stable). Sinofert's fertilizer business and SIC's crop protection/agro-chemical business are the two main pillars of the group's agricultural segment, which share equal levels of strategic and operational importance.

In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch’s factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch’s ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed. The information in this report is provided “as is” without any representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to print subscribers.

The IPO of about 3.3 billion shares was priced at HK$2.45 per share, near the bottom of an indicative range of HK$2.42 to HK$2.53, IFR, a Thomson Reuters publication, said on Wednesday, citing people close to the deal. That would put the total deal at HK$8.09 billion ($1.04 billion). Zhongyuan Bank, the largest city commercial bank in central China's Henan province, didn't reply to a Reuters' emailed request for comment on the IPO pricing. It is among several smaller Chinese banks that have gone public in Hong Kong over the past several months to strengthen their balance sheets amid a boom in lending in the world's second largest economy. The deals have met tepid demand from retail and institutional investors in the city as concerns grow over a surge in non-performing loans and the effects of a slowdown in China on bad debts. The stock market performance of Chinese banks recently listed in Hong Kong has been less than stellar, with shares trading between a decline of 22 percent to a gain of 7.7 percent from their IPO levels, underperforming the broader market index. Bank of Tianjin, China Zeshang Bank, Jilin Jiutai Rural Commercial Bank and Guangzhou Rural Commercial Bank were among the lenders that listed over the past several months. Zhongyuan Bank is set to debut on the Hong Kong stock exchange on July 19. CCB International, CITIC CLSA, CMB International and JP Morgan acted as joint sponsors of the IPO, with BoCom International, Central China Securities, First Capital Securities, GF Securities, Haitong International and SPDB International also acting as joint bookrunners.

The loan sale - representing about seven percent of the bank's $39 billion offshore assets - comes as Chinese regulators move to reduce leverage and control potential systemic risk, including problems posed by domestic companies acquiring overseas assets. Hong Kong based CITIC Bank International has put 51 Asia offshore loans up for sale, most of which were made to companies based in mainland China, Basis Point reported, citing people with direct knowledge of the matter and a sale document. The loans are largely denominated in U.S. and Hong Kong dollars, maturing between 2017 to 2021. The largest loan up for sale is a $600 million chunk of a $12.7 billion syndicated financing facility backing China National Chemical Corp’s (ChemChina) $44 billion acquisition of pesticides and seeds group Syngenta AG, according the document and the sources, Basis Point said. CITIC Bank International, together with its parent China CITIC Bank, was the global coordinator and largest lender of the facility. The bank is also selling a HK$4 billion ($512 million) portion of a loan used to finance Hong Kong-listed Goldin Properties Holdings Ltd's take-private, HK$2 billion of lending to debt-laden property developer China Evergrande Group and $30 million to acquisitive Chinese conglomerate Fosun, according to the document and sources.  Basis Point was not able to ascertain the reason for the sale but banks typically offload portfolios in the secondary market to reduce credit and liquidity risk. Bankers in receipt of the sale document said the $2.8 billion portfolio was unusually large for the Asian secondary loan market. A Hong Kong-based spokesman for CITIC Bank International declined to comment. Scaling Back The Chinese banking regulator is cracking down following years of aggressive lending by Chinese banks, particularly to finance overseas acquisitions. Chinese firms spent a record $221 billion on assets overseas in 2016, ranging from movie studios to football clubs.  Chinese banks' share of the Asia ex-Japan market in syndicated loans, usually used to fund acquisitions, was more than a third last year compared to about 14 percent in 2013, according to Thomson Reuters LPC data. Last month, China's banking regulator ordered a group of lenders to assess their exposure to offshore acquisitions by HNA Group, Dalian Wanda Group Co, Anbang Insurance Group, and Fosun, Reuters reported, without naming the banks. Several Chinese loan bankers said they were also looking to deleverage their portfolio and would be selective in lending in the second half of 2017.  We have been asked to tighten our lending in the second half after making so many loans in the past few years,  one Hong Kong-based senior loan banker told Basis Point.

It was also the first time that the firm has publicly acknowledged it wants equity in the world's No. 2 NAND chip maker.

But people familiar with the matter told Reuters on Tuesday that Toshiba is negotiating with rival bidders Western Digital Corp and Taiwan's Foxconn as talks with the preferred bidder consortium have stalled. SK Hynix's insistence on putting up its money through convertible bonds, which could eventually give the firm equity interest, threatens to scuttle the deal for the preferred bidder group, they have said.

Deputy Governor Broadbent said the mood among businesses was central to his analysis and that it was  very difficult  for the bank's Monetary Policy Committee to judge whether there had been a significant improvement.  In my opinion, it is a bit tricky at the moment to make a decision (to raise rates). I am not ready to do it yet,  Broadbent told the Press and Journal newspaper during a trip to the Scottish city of Aberdeen.     Investors have keenly awaited Broadbent's thoughts on rates, because he has not commented publicly since the Monetary Policy Committee came unexpectedly close to raising interest rates for the first time in a decade last month. Several analysts have said the views of Broadbent - who is deputy governor for monetary policy - would be key to assessing the chances of a first BoE rate hike in a decade. Broadbent said economic growth had been  okay  during the last six to 12 months and pointed to rising employment and inflation.  There is reason to see the committee moving in that direction (higher interest rates) – but there are still a lot of imponderables,  he said. The Press and Journal quoted Broadbent as saying that many companies would remain nervous about their prospects while they were  one or two years down the road  of knowing what Brexit means. On Tuesday, Broadbent said in a speech that a reduction in trade between Britain and the European Union would harm both economies and causes prices to rise. New MPC member Silvana Tenreyro, who replaced rate-increase advocate Kristin Forbes this month, has yet to speak on policy.

MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan ticked up 0.3 percent. Japan's yen-sensitive Nikkei slid 0.4 percent on the yen's gains but MSCI's dollar-denominated Japan index gained 0.5 percent. European shares are expected to rise, with spread-betters looking to gains of 0.3 percent in Germany's DAX and Britain's FTSE, and a 0.2 percent rise in France's CAC at the opening. U.S. stocks took a brief tumble after emails disclosed Trump's eldest son welcomed help from a Russian lawyer for his father's 2016 election campaign against Hillary Clinton. But by the closing bell, Wall Street shares had clawed back their losses.  The e-mails look pretty bad but then again they don't look like decisive evidence (for illegal behaviour) either. I doubt this alone would lead to a risk-off market,  said Hiroko Iwaki, senior fixed income strategist at Mizuho Securities. U.S. shares were helped in part as the Senate announced a two-week delay to its August recess to allow more time to tackle a measure that would repeal key parts of Obamacare, as well as pursue other legislative priorities. Still, it remained unclear whether U.S. Senate Republicans have the votes to pass the measure or even what form it would finally take. On the other hand, the dollar failed to recover after the damage suffered from the new twist in the Trump campaign's alleged links with Russia. The euro vaulted to a 14-month high of $1.14895 in Asian trade. The dollar also lost steam against the yen, which had been under renewed pressure following Friday's bond-buying by the Bank of Japan which highlighted divergent monetary polices between the two countries. The U.S. currency dropped 0.4 percent to 113.46 yen, slipping from a four-month high of 114.495 yen touched on Tuesday. The Canadian dollar stood at C$1.2907 per dollar, near Friday's 10-month peak of C$1.2860 as investors brace for a likely rate hike by the Bank of Canada, its first tightening since 2010, later in the day. The move would make Canada the first to follow the U.S. Federal Reserve in removing the monetary stimulus poured into the global economy, with the European Central Bank and the Bank of England also seen moving in that direction in coming months. The dollar's index against a basket of six major currencies was hovering at 95.58, just above its nine-month low of 95.47 plumbed at the end of June. U.S. Treasuries yields stayed below their recent peaks, with the 10-year yield at 2.352 percent, compared with 2.398 percent marked on Friday, its loftiest level in almost two months. Ahead of Fed Chair Yellen's testimony to Congress on the state of the U.S. economy from 1400 GMT, two of her colleagues cited low wage growth and muted inflation as reasons for caution on further interest rate increases. Fed Governor Lael Brainard embraced the plan to reduce the balance sheet  soon,  but suggested her support for any future rate increases will depend in part on how inflation shapes up. Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank President Neel Kashkari said he finds it hard to believe that the U.S. economy is in danger of overheating when wage growth is so low. Traders trimmed expectations of a rate hike by the end of the year, with dollar interest rate futures pricing in about a 55 percent chance compared to about 60 percent earlier, while most investors expect the Fed to decide to start shrinking its balance sheet in September.  Yellen has indicated after the June policy meeting, in the clearest way as possible by her standards, that she plans to start balance sheet reduction and there will be one more rate hike this year. Since then, there's been no big changes in the economy,  said Tomoaki Shishido, senior market economist at Nomura Securities.  I would think the U.S. CPI data on Friday could be more important. If the Fed's assessment that the softness in CPI between February and May is transitory, the Fed will go ahead with its plan. If that's not the case, some Fed policymakers will want to revise that plan,  he added. Reaction was largely muted to a story by Politico that Trump is increasingly unlikely to nominate Yellen next year for a second term, and National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn is the leading candidate to succeed her. Oil prices extended gains from the previous day as the U.S. government cut its crude production outlook for next year and as fuel inventories plunged. U.S. crude futures rose 1.8 percent to $45.83 per barrel, extending their recovery from Monday's near two-week low of $43.65. Brent futures gained 1.5 percent to $48.25 per barrel. Both contracts have risen above their 50 percent retracement of their fall between mid-last week and Monday.

The United Nations University (UNU) said financial tools were a powerful means to disrupt the flow of money generated from human trafficking, with the illegal industry estimated to be worth about $150 billion a year. As many as 45.8 million people, most of them women and girls, are estimated to be enslaved globally, according to the 2016 Global Slavery Index by rights group Walk Free Foundation. They are typically forced to work in factories, mines and farms, sold for sex, trapped in debt bondage or born into servitude. Money generated by human trafficking comes from crime and handling those funds can be considered money laundering or, in some cases, financing terrorism, the UNU report said.  Human trafficking is both big business and a serious crime,  said James Cockayne, head of the UNU Office at the United Nations and author of the report, in an accompanying statement.  Disrupting the associated financial flows associated with these crimes will make a powerful contribution to improving these lives and preventing future crimes.  Financial institutions could help identify money couriers as well as so-called  straw men  used to conceal identities and cash-intensive businesses that typically play roles in human trafficking networks, the report said. Risk assessment maps, due diligence procedures, information sharing and protecting whistleblowers are among the tools available to banks, private investors, credit risk agencies, institutional investors and regulators, it said.  Relatively little attention has been paid to the role of the financial sector in efforts to tackle human trafficking and modern slavery, helping to make these crimes relatively low risk and high reward for perpetrators - and, arguably, for banks, other financial intermediaries and investors,  the report said. Also, most financial institutions have a limited understanding of the financial aspects of human trafficking and their risk of exposure, it said. That is beginning to change, as corruption, bribery and trafficking are increasingly seen as linked, said Archana Kotecha, head of the legal department at Liberty Asia, an anti-slavery charity, and a contributor to the report.  It is only very recently that the three have started to come together and people to understand that you have to not simply view slavery as a gross human rights violation but as an illicit business,  she said at a U.N. event held to release the report. Obstacles may include laws protecting privacy and confidentiality, technical issues or rules regarding defamation or libel, said the report, entitled  25 Keys to Unlock the Financial Chains of Human Trafficking & Modern Slavery.  In the United States, legislation was introduced in May in Congress that would boost financial regulations to help identify and report trafficking and help deny traffickers access to the financial system.

About a third of people in developing-world cities live in informal settlements, where they often lack access to basic services, said a report from the Washington-based World Resources Institute (WRI).  Globally, 1.6 billion people in urban areas are expected to need affordable homes by 2025, up from 1.2 billion today, as cities attract more migrants, it added. “We think it’s a crisis when one-in-three households - one-in-three citizens that live in cities - don’t have adequate, secure or affordable housing,” said Robin King of WRI’s Ross Center for Sustainable Cities. According to the report, 56 percent of Africa’s urban population live in slums – rising as high as 90 percent in some countries like Ghana - while in India, it is 24 percent.  Report co-author King told the Thomson Reuters Foundation that if action does not begin now in some cities in Africa and South Asia, “the problem will be much, much worse”.   Mid-sized cities in particular, which tend to have the fastest expansion rates, need to respond quickly before it’s too late, she added. Improved housing would help boost cities’ economic growth, reduce their environmental impact and lower social inequality, the report said. Moving families from slums to poorly serviced new communities on the fringes of sprawling cities has often left them isolated and with limited job options, forcing them to undertake costly commutes each day for work, it said. To cope with the housing shortage, slums should be made part of the solution by involving residents in programs to upgrade them and providing better safety, jobs, health and education, it added. Schemes are underway to improve favelas in Rio de Janeiro and slums in Indonesia, for example. “Poor people can improve their lives through incremental upgrading of their homes - and that can only be possible if they feel some sense of security,” said Sheela Patel, chair of Shack/Slum Dwellers International, a network of community-based groups for the urban poor. For that to happen, governments must provide amenities and ensure land tenure, she told a call for journalists.  'Backyard' Rentals Revamping and strengthening the home rental market while offering rent subsidies could help informal workers struggling to meet requirements for entry-level home loans, said WRI. Ways to open up more shelter in cities include regulations to better protect tenants and landlords, easier access to arbitration, and rule changes so that people can rent a single room or even “hot-bed” for a few hours, said the report. Moves by South Africa’s Gauteng province to legalize hundreds of thousands of “backyard rentals” - often shacks or rooms tacked onto the backs of houses - have helped ease Johannesburg’s housing problem, said WRI.  Rent-to-own deals and collective ownership schemes can also expand choices, it added. Other options to help poor people find affordable homes include incentives for developers to build low-cost housing as part of urban regeneration schemes and techniques to increase housing density like those used in São Paulo. “Land in cities is worth an awful lot, especially (in) fast-growing cities, even if incomes are low,” said Diana Mitlin, professor of urban development at Britain’s University of Manchester. “There is often a problem in ensuring well-located land is allocated to low-income groups.” Reporting by Sophie Hares; editing by Megan Rowling.

The deal includes seed processing plants and seed research centers, a copy of Dow AgroSciences' Brazilian corn germplasm bank, the Morgan seed brand and a license for the use of the Dow Sementes brand for a certain period of time, Dow said on Tuesday.  The assets, which generated revenue of about $287 million in 2016, are being sold by Dow to meet conditions set by Brazilian  antitrust regulators for its $130 billion merger with DuPont. The deal will boost China's share of the global seed business, which is being remade by a series of huge mergers. These include the $43 billion takeover of Swiss firm Syngenta by state-owned Chemchina in China's largest foreign takeover. Chemchina said recently it is looking to snap up seed assets that rival Bayer must sell to gain regulatory approval for its takeover of Monsanto. CITIC Agri Fund was founded in 2016 by CITIC Agriculture, a division of state-backed CITIC Ltd, along with Chinese seed firm Yuan Longping High-Tech Co Ltd (000998.SZ) and two other listed agricultural companies, according to CITIC Ltd's 2016 annual report. CITIC Ltd, China's largest conglomerate with interests in financial services to real estate and heavy industry, could not immediately be reached for comment. The company made its first foray into the seed business in 2014, buying a majority stake in Yuan Longping High-Tech, one of China's leading breeders of hybrid rice. Yuan Longping High-Tech said that year that it wanted to become one of the world's top five seed companies. Dow and DuPont (DD.N) announced the all-stock merger in December 2015. The two companies won U.S. antitrust approval last month to merge on condition that they sell certain crop protection products and other assets. The European Union also cleared their merger in March.  Dow reaffirmed that the merger deal was expected to close next month, with the intended spin-offs to occur within 18 months of closing. The companies have said that they would split into three separate companies specializing in material sciences, specialty products, and seeds and agrochemicals upon completion of the merger.

The deal includes seed processing plants and seed research centers, a copy of Dow AgroSciences' Brazilian corn germplasm bank, the Morgan seed brand and a license for the use of the Dow Sementes brand for a certain period of time, Dow said on Tuesday.  The assets, which generated revenue of about $287 million in 2016, are being sold by Dow to meet conditions set by Brazilian  antitrust regulators for its $130 billion merger with DuPont. The deal will boost China's share of the global seed business, which is being remade by a series of huge mergers. These include the $43 billion takeover of Swiss firm Syngenta by state-owned Chemchina in China's largest foreign takeover. Chemchina said recently it is looking to snap up seed assets that rival Bayer must sell to gain regulatory approval for its takeover of Monsanto. CITIC Agri Fund was founded in 2016 by CITIC Agriculture, a division of state-backed CITIC Ltd, along with Chinese seed firm Yuan Longping High-Tech Co Ltd (000998.SZ) and two other listed agricultural companies, according to CITIC Ltd's 2016 annual report. CITIC Ltd, China's largest conglomerate with interests in financial services to real estate and heavy industry, could not immediately be reached for comment. The company made its first foray into the seed business in 2014, buying a majority stake in Yuan Longping High-Tech, one of China's leading breeders of hybrid rice. Yuan Longping High-Tech said that year that it wanted to become one of the world's top five seed companies. Dow and DuPont (DD.N) announced the all-stock merger in December 2015. The two companies won U.S. antitrust approval last month to merge on condition that they sell certain crop protection products and other assets. The European Union also cleared their merger in March.  Dow reaffirmed that the merger deal was expected to close next month, with the intended spin-offs to occur within 18 months of closing. The companies have said that they would split into three separate companies specializing in material sciences, specialty products, and seeds and agrochemicals upon completion of the merger.

Torrential rain that began a week ago set off landslides and sent rivers surging over their banks on the southwestern island of Kyushu, at one point forcing more than 400,000 people from their homes. Twenty-five people were killed and 23 are still missing. Abe, whose support has plunged to its lowest since he took office in 2012, cut short a European tour by a day because of the disaster and went to visit the region less than 24 hours after returning.  I was able to talk with people in evacuation centers and hear their worries and troubles,  said Abe. A police officer stands next to debris swept away by heavy rain in Asakura, Fukuoka Prefecture, Japan July 9, 2017.Issei Kato The government will make every effort to rebuild so that people can resume their former lives without worries.  About 11,000 soldiers, police and firefighters are combing through mud and piles of logs in the largely rural area, searching for the missing.

Abe knelt down to talk to survivors sitting on the floor of the evacuation center and he also inspected the site of a destroyed railway bridge. One woman told media Abe had shaken her hand and commiserated with her about how tough things must be.  We want him to work hard for Japan,  she said.

Brent crude contracts rose 1.5 percent to $48.23 a barrel, extending gains from the previous day as the U.S. government cut its crude production outlook for next year and as fuel inventories plunged. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan ticked up 0.4 percent after Wall Street managed to weather a fresh twist in the controversy over U.S. President Donald Trump's alleged connection with Russia. Another factor that may influence market behaviour is financial results from major companies in the Gulf.  Second quarter results may not be a game changer, but investors will be looking out for companies that surprise them, so it's more cherry picking this season,  said a Kuwait-based portfolio manager. Consensus estimates for the total net profit in the three months to June 30 for roughly four-fifths of all listed Gulf companies is forecasted to be dip 2.5 percent compared to a year ago period, according to SICO Bahrain. Shares of Mobile Telecommunications Company (Zain Saudi) may find some buying interest after Bloomberg reported the company is nearing an agreement to sell about 7,500 mobile phone towers, which could fetch as much as $500 million, to Lebanon's TASC Towers, citing people familiar with the matter.

Prosecutor German Juarez, in the attorney general's office, said in a written request he had evidence that would prove in court that the couple took illegally obtained money from Brazilian construction company Odebrecht SA [ODBES.UL] and the late Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez that was used to bankroll Humala's campaigns and for personal gain. Humala denied any wrongdoing and called the request  surprising and abusive.    We're complying with all of the prosecutor's orders. We've been collaborating with the investigation because we have the biggest stake in this being cleared up,  Humala told reporters outside his home in Lima, where he spoke beside his wife and the co-founder of his political party, Nadine Heredia. A hearing is scheduled for Wednesday and, if Judge Richard Concepcion approves Juarez' request, Humala would become the second former Peruvian leader sought for arrest since Odebrecht acknowledged publicly last year that it bribed officials across Latin America over a decade-long period.    Judge Richard Concepcion attend the hearing for former President Ollanta Humala and his wife Nadine Heredia (not present) at a courtroom in Lima, Peru July 12, 2017.Guadalupe PardoConcepcion ordered former president Alejandro Toledo to be jailed for up to 18 months in February before a trial over allegations he took $20 million in bribes from Odebrecht. Toledo, believed to be in the United States, denies wrongdoing and has refused to turn himself in. In Peru, the Odebrecht scandal has so far mostly tarnished the reputations of left-leaning Humala and centrist Toledo - allowing their right-wing critics to portray them as hypocrites for railing against graft in the government of their predecessor, former autocratic president Alberto Fujimori. Slideshow (3 Images)Fujimori is serving a 25-year prison sentence for convictions that include human rights violations and corruption.  Juarez said two of Odebrecht's former executives have testified that they arranged to send $3 million for Humala's 2011 campaign on orders from the Workers Party of Brazil. The money was the product of corruption, Juarez said. Juarez also alleged that Humala's 2006 campaign was financed with money that Chavez stole from Venezuela's treasury. Humala ran an unsuccessful presidential bid in 2006 as an ally of Chavez before winning the 2011 election after recasting himself as a more moderate leftist in the style of Brazil's former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who founded the Workers Party.

Scarborough and Brzezinski, who are engaged, were embroiled in public argument with the Republican president two weeks ago. After Trump levied personal attacks against Brzezinski in a series of messages on social network Twitter, the pair responded with a searing opinion piece in the Washington Post that questioned his mental health. Trump beat Democrat Hillary Clinton last November in the most divisive presidential election in modern U.S. politics, in which a gulf between Republicans and Democrats has widened and  hardened over ideological positions on social and economic issues.

U.S. stocks took a brief tumble overnight after emails disclosed Trump's eldest son welcomed help from a Russian lawyer for his father's 2016 election campaign, but the stocks reversed their losses by close.      MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan  rose 0.4 percent on Wednesday.      Ahead of Yellen's testimony to Congress on the state of the U.S. economy from 1400 GMT, two of her colleagues cited low wage growth and muted inflation as reasons for caution on further interest rate increases.     Philippine shares led the gains in Southeast Asia, climbing as much as 1 percent to hit its highest in more than three weeks, driven by real estate and telecom stocks.

The Philippines recorded a trade deficit of $2.753 billion in May, the country's worst in decades, data showed on Tuesday.       It's (trade deficit) a welcome development, and we see some semblance of improvement on this side - it's the sign of a rising economy,  said Manny Cruz, an analyst with Manila-based Asiasec Equities Inc.     Indonesia inched up 0.5 percent, helped by strong gains in the financial sector. Bank Mandiri (Persero) Tbk PT  gained as much as 1.7 percent, while Bank Negara Indonesia rose 1.5 percent.      Thai shares were up as much as 0.3 percent, supported by industrials and financials, while Vietnam rose as much as 0.6 percent, its biggest intraday percentage gain in nearly two weeks.     Meanwhile, Singapore shares fell as much as 0.5 percent, with heavyweights DBS Group and Singapore Telecommunications declining about 0.8 percent each.     Malaysian shares were largely flat.

The government of Australia's most populous state said it had agreed to pay A$262 million ($200 million) to buy back 51.4 percent of Shenhua's exploration license on the Liverpool Plains 400 kms (250 miles) northwest of Sydney.  Under this government there will be no more exploration and no mining on the fertile black-soil plains of the Liverpool Plains,  NSW Minister for Resources Don Harwin told reporters in Sydney.  The ridges are areas where exploration can continue but the fertile black soil of the Liverpool Plains will be protected from mining as a result of us buying back the exploration license today.      Anti-mining activists vowed to continue campaigning for a complete ban on mining in the region, including a coal mine proposed by Korea Electric Power Corp (Kepco).  This buyback does little to address the impact of the large coal pit that will still be built (by Shenhua) to mine coal,  said Phil Laird, the national coordinator for environmental group Lock the Gate Alliance.   We will continue to campaign to have all mining there stopped.  The exploration license for Shenhua's A$1 billion Watermark mine, granted in 2008, sparked a public backlash and split Australia's conservative ruling coalition into pro-mining and pro-farming camps. Development has been delayed by assessments and modifications in response to concerns raised by farmers, and mining has not yet begun.     Shenhua said in an emailed statement it was disappointed by the government's move and would have mined the area responsibly, but added the buyback was an  acceptable financial outcome . Kepco is facing renewed resistance from farmers after the state's planning department endorsed its project, saying the impact on water supplies was outweighed by the economic benefits a mine would bring. Last year, New South Wales agreed to buy back BHP Billiton's license for the Caroona coal mine on the Liverpool Plains for A$220 million, ending a decade-long fight by farmers to shut down the project. Another open-cut coal project in NSW's Hunter Valley, south of the Liverpool Plains, was sold by Anglo American in May amid opposition from racehorse breeders in the area. The buyer, Malabar Coal, promised to proceed with an underground mine.

Mohsen Dehnavi, his wife and three children were put on a return flight at about 9 p.m. after being detained late on Monday at Logan International Airport, the Boston Globe said, citing Stephanie Malin, a spokeswoman for U.S. Customs and Border Patrol.  The detentions were apparently unrelated to President Donald Trump's executive order temporarily banning travelers from six majority-Muslim countries, according to Boston Children's Hospital and immigration law specialists, who said Dehnavi had a valid entry visa.  Based on what we know, it's not travel-ban related. It's probably something much more stupid than that,  said Susan Church, chair of the New England chapter of the American Immigration Lawyers Association.  The rules say if you have a valid visa you have to be let in,  she told Reuters. A spokesman for U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement did not immediately respond to telephone calls and emails to seek comment. Two weeks ago, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a revised version of Trump's ban on travelers from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen, though it excluded visitors with a  bona fide  family tie. The executive order itself did not apply to travelers with valid visas. During the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump had called for a  complete and total shutdown  of Muslims entering the United States, a move he called necessary to protect national security in the wake of attacks at home and abroad by Islamist extremists. Opponents of the idea called it a violation of the U.S. Constitution's protections for free expression of religion. Trump's initial January version of the order, which also applied to Iraq, caused a weekend of chaos at U.S. airports as travelers were turned away upon arrival and crowds of thousands turned out to protest against the move.

Two weeks ago, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a revised version of Trump's ban on travelers from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen, though it excluded visitors with a  bona fide  family tie. The executive order itself did not apply to travelers with valid visas. During the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump had called for a  complete and total shutdown  of Muslims entering the United States, a move he called necessary to protect national security in the wake of attacks at home and abroad by Islamist extremists. Opponents of the idea called it a violation of the U.S. Constitution's protections for free expression of religion. Trump's initial January version of the order, which also applied to Iraq, caused a weekend of chaos at U.S. airports as travelers were turned away upon arrival and crowds of thousands turned out to protest against the move.

The United States has plenty of idle equipment laying around after its own unconventional drilling boom cooled. But moving that machinery from the plains of Texas to the windswept Patagonian desert is proving complex and costly for global oil majors who say Argentina's protectionist past is slowing efforts to spark its own shale revolution. A move by Argentina's government to cut import taxes on used oil-field equipment has sparked fierce opposition from local manufacturers, who are lobbying the government to include protections for them in a measure they fear will destroy their livelihoods.  Among them is Adrian Ramos, president of QM Equipment, a manufacturer of drilling and fracking equipment located in the Argentine coastal city of Mar del Plata.   We got in touch with [the Production Ministry] and let them know it was totally impossible for us to survive this,  Ramos told Reuters in a telephone interview. Negotiations with Ramos and others have slowed the rollout of tariff reductions. President Mauricio Macri in April had promised oil executives the changes would be coming within  weeks.  The previously unreported talks with local manufacturers underscore the challenges faced by Macri, who came to power in 2015 on a wave of popular discontent that ended 12 years of leftist rule. The market-friendly former businessman has pledged to revive Argentina's moribund, inflation-racked economy by reducing trade barriers and wooing foreign investment.  But he has gotten blowback from industries and unions that have benefited from protectionist policies. With mid-term elections approaching in October, popular opposition to rising imports and factory layoffs has become a vulnerability for Macri's  Let's Change  coalition. Big oil firms, meanwhile, are fuming too. Vaca Muerta, a Belgium-sized shale formation located in the western Patagonian province of Neuquen, is seen as the most promising unconventional oil and gas field outside of North America, the birthplace of the shale revolution.  Already burdened with pricey labor and transport costs in Argentina, companies have grown frustrated with delays in the equipment import reform. Speaking at an industry event in Buenos Aires in late June, Richard Spies, chief executive of Pan America Energy, an Argentine subsidiary of BP PLC, called on government officials to hit the accelerator.  Get these things done,  Spies said.  We need that equipment that's idle in the United States moved down here to facilitate the developments that are coming in Vaca Muerta.  In an emailed response to questions from Reuters, a Production Ministry spokesman said the import proposal was advancing and a decree would be passed by the executive branch in the coming weeks. It would not need congressional approval, the spokesman said. Bringing The  Dead Cow  to Life A drilling rig is seen at the Loma Campana Vaca Muerta shale oil and gas drilling site, own by Argentina's state-controlled energy company YPF, in the Patagonian province of Neuquen, Argentina June 22, 2017.Juliana CastillaArgentina is one of many resource-rich Latin American countries that have struggled to develop abundant oil and mineral reserves. Rules aimed at protecting domestic players and guaranteeing large revenues for government have chased away some foreign investors.  New right-leaning governments in the region have introduced business-friendly policies to lure them back. Brazil's Congress in 2016 opened the nation's deepwater pre-salt fields to foreign operators. This year Peru lowered air-quality standards to attract mining investment. Spurring development of Vaca Muerta - Spanish for 'Dead Cow' - is one of Macri's major priorities as he tries to unwind regulations put in place by his predecessor Cristina Fernandez. Argentina holds the world's second-largest shale gas reserves, but it imports a quarter of its energy needs, one reason for the country's $7-billion current account deficit. Macri has promised rail and pipeline projects to connect remote Vaca Muerta to markets and ports. Most crucially, he struck a deal with unions in January to reduce notoriously high labor costs. Still, production costs remain well above those of global competitors. Prices at the Loma Campana field, jointly operated by state-run oil company YPF SA and Chevron Corp exceed $43 per barrel, compared with $32 in the Niobrara in Colorado and Wyoming. (For a look at Argentine shale activity, see tmsnrt.rs/2uPm98U)     Used oil equipment can currently be imported at tariffs ranging from 7 percent to 28 percent, with imports of some types of machinery banned, the Energy Ministry said in an emailed statement to Reuters.  The proposed change would eliminate the bans, lower tariffs to between 0 percent and 7 percent and provide a form of compensation for companies that buy locally produced equipment, the Ministry said. It added that it has been meeting with drillers, oil services companies and local manufacturers about the rule.   Evidently this dialogue process has taken time,  a ministry spokesman wrote.  We expect the decree to be signed soon.    Compete or 'Disappear' Local companies fear the changes could be devastating.  Everaldo Santa Cruz is head of the oil and gas business at HTI SA, a maker of drilling and hydraulic fracturing equipment in Canuelas, Buenos Aires province. He said HTI has invested heavily in building frac pumps to supply drillers in Vaca Muerta, and that the $1.2 million price tag is comparable with that of U.S. manufacturers. But Santa Cruz said he worries he will never get to fully develop that part of his business if the decree is passed. HTI doesn't stand a chance if his customers are allowed to import equipment they already own from the United States, paying only transport costs and the lowered tariffs, he said.   We understand that it can speed up production to an extent,  Santa Cruz said.  But there's a risk that companies like ours that try to develop local solutions to support the industry simply disappear.

The CSI300 index rose 0.1 percent, to 3,674.84 points at the end of the morning session, while the Shanghai Composite Index lost 0.2 percent, to 3,196.56 points. An index tracking the 50 most representative blue-chips in Shanghai, dubbed the  Nifty 50 , gained 1 percent to its highest since August 2015, with heavyweight banking shares far outperforming the broader market.  The bull run in bank stocks is mainly due to improved profitability in those lenders amid a weak recovery in the economy,  said Sun Lijin, an analyst with Pacific Securities. The lenders were also chased for their valuations and solid fundamentals, Sun said, adding he expected them to continue to outperform. Small-caps extended losses into a third session, with the tech-heavy start-up board ChiNext losing 0.8 percent to a one-month low. Analysts said the sluggishness was due in part to concerns about mid-year earnings and expectations of more equities coming onto Chinese markets. Sector performance was mixed. Banking and real estate shares led the gains while healthcare plays fell. China Merchants Bank, a leading retail bank, rose 3.6 percent to a more than nine-year high.

The man behind the confiscation of General Motors Co’s $100 million assembly plant in April is a much more obscure figure: Kaled Kansao, the owner of two long-defunct GM dealerships. Kansao convinced a court to seize the plant as the remedy for a relatively small-time business dispute - over GM's termination of his franchises - that mushroomed into a 17-year court battle. The legal fight that pushed GM out of Venezuela offers a unique case study in the struggles of foreign corporations to keep operations afloat - much less turn a profit - amid the OPEC nation's economic and political chaos. The seizure stands out because it stems from a dispute with private citizens rather than the government, highlighting yet another risk of doing business in Venezuela – the specter of debilitating legal judgments, said Francisco Martinez, president of Venezuela's main business organization, Fedecamaras.  It would be impossible to say that the legal proceedings against General Motors had any legal logic,  Martinez said.  Venezuela does not provide even the most minimal guarantees with respect to investment or private property.  The Venezuelan government's Information Ministry did not respond to a request for comment. Venezuela ranked 187 out of 190 countries in the World Bank's 2017 Ease of Doing Business report, which evaluates countries' regulatory systems. Only Eritrea, Libya and Somalia scored worse. Under Chavez, the socialist firebrand who died in 2013, some asset seizures featured gun-wielding soldiers and live television broadcasts. The GM case had its own less publicized drama, including dueling allegations of courthouse misdeeds; recusals by judges citing security concerns; a dispute over 158 vehicles that GM says  vanished ; and mysterious damage calculations awarding the dealers thousands of cars. GM stopped producing vehicles here in 2015 amid a lack of access to supplies. But the judgment appears to have doused any remaining hopes that it will produce cars again in Venezuela anytime soon. The company terminated the plant's 2,700 workers after the decision. In its initial announcement in April, GM did not connect the plant seizure to the dealers' lawsuit, saying only that the facility was  unexpectedly  seized by  public authorities.  In response to inquiries from Reuters, the company provided a detailed history of its frustrations with the proceedings, which it called  absurd  and rife with  irregularities.  In the end, a civil court in the western state of Zulia granted the dealers' request to attach GM assets worth up to about $115 million.  Venezuelan law requires the court to auction off the factory to satisfy the judgment. In the meantime, it ordered GM to pay the dealers to pay an  occupation fee  that at the time equated to about $36,000 a month - in effect, rent on its own plant.  The illegal and outrageous seizure was the final act of a series of unfortunate events beyond GMV's control,  GM told Reuters, referring to its Venezuela subsidiary. GM did not respond to questions about whether it had any intention of paying the court judgments or trying to regain control of the factory. In a May press statement, Kansao and his business partner, Elena Rodriguez, accused GM of perjury, influence trafficking, and violation of the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, without offering evidence. GM has ignored court rulings because it believes  might is right as a law,  Kansao told Reuters. Idled Workers Collect Salaries Back in 2000, Kansao and Rodriguez operated two GM dealerships that had originally been founded by Kansao's father. In an interview, Kansao said GM arbitrarily stripped him of his franchise, which he said brought  tragedy and calamity  on his family. FILE PHOTO: A water tank with the GM logo is seen at the General Motors Assembly Plant in Valencia, April 21, 2017.Marco Bello/File PhotoGM said it terminated the agreement for a range of reasons, including the dealers' failure to meet a minimum monthly sales average of 25 vehicles. Nearly two decades later, the dealers' hopes of collecting on the judgment now hinge on whether a court-ordered auction attracts a buyer - an unlikely prospect in a nation where the auto industry has all but collapsed. Chronic shortages of hard currency have left automakers unable to import parts, while triple digit inflation has left would-be customers struggling to buy basics like food and medicine. In 2016, output at Venezuela's seven biggest auto plants had dropped below 3,000 cars, down from a peak of 172,000 vehicles in 2007 – 79,000 of those from GM, according to auto industry group Cavenez. Labor laws dictate that the dealers would also have to wait behind GM workers - who contend they are owed severance payments - to collect any proceeds from a factory auction. GM did not respond to questions about workers' severance. The automaker had agreed with union leaders to continue paying workers after the plant stopped making cars, said Adan Tortolero, one of several union leaders at the defunct plant. FILE PHOTO: The GM logo is seen at the General Motors Assembly Plant in Valencia, April 21, 2017.Marco Bello/File PhotoGM tried to shed that obligation last year by offering buyouts of about $3,500 per worker, Tortolero said, but workers spurned the offer because it seemed small in comparison to the pay and benefits the workers had previously enjoyed. One lucrative perk was the right to buy two factory cars every year at government-regulated prices that were well below their actual market value. The regulated prices were theoretically available to anyone, but because demand for cars far outstripped supply, most buyers had to get waiting lists – which usually required large under-the-table payments. GM employees had been among the first in line to buy the cars at regulated prices, which allowed them to sell the vehicles at a steep premium. 9,725 Cars In 2007, the Zulia court ordered the automaker to compensate the plaintiffs with 9,725 vehicles, according to the decision, which offered no explanation for that number of cars. It did require the plaintiffs to pay GM for the vehicles, but only after they were sold. Asked to provide evidence that the proceedings had been corrupted, GM pointed out that six judges and two court employees had recused themselves, with most citing  threats and personal security concerns.  It also said that the court failed to enforce an order preventing the dealers from selling 158 cars that they seized during the dispute. GM said those vehicles later  vanished,  and the dealers never paid for them. Kansao and Rodriguez did not respond to questions about the 158 cars. The case bounced through different courts for the next decade until April 4 of this year, when the Zulia court authorized the plaintiffs to encumber GM assets worth up to 477 billion bolivars - at the time worth about $115 million - as leverage to collect a cash judgment of half that amount. The court based the compensation on the full value of the 9,725 cars - rather than the much smaller profit the dealers would have made selling them, GM said. But the legal victory may have little payoff in reality, just as GM's losses may be largely symbolic - given that it hasn't produced or sold cars in Venezuela since 2015. Asked what sort of buyer the factory might attract in a government auction, Kansao responded:  Only God knows that.

Wells, which was the No. 2 U.S. provider of auto loans less than a year ago, has already cut quarterly originations by nearly 30 percent over the nine months leading into March 31, according to a May 11 company presentation. It has also begun consolidating the collections operation in a move that people familiar with the business say could eliminate hundreds of jobs, after a new head of auto finance took the reins in April. Wells Fargo joins other lenders in reducing exposure to the rapidly cooling U.S. auto market. Bankers, auto industry executives, analysts and regulators have been warning since 2014 that the auto loan market could overheat after being fueled for years by low interest rates and easy financing terms. Chasing growth, some lenders, including Wells Fargo, began to embrace borrowers with shaky credit. In late 2015, however, auto default rates began creeping above other types of consumer debt, according to data compiled by Cox Automotive, prompting some lenders to tighten standards and edge away from the market. Wells Fargo began curtailing its auto exposure beginning last year. It cut the share of subprime loans in the auto portfolio to over 8 percent in the first quarter from over 11 percent a year earlier, according to a company presentation. Analysts expect to see higher delinquency and default rates when Wells Fargo reports results on Friday.  The general view, which they've been pretty clear about, is that loan growth will be negative for next two to three quarters,  said Brian Foran, an analyst at Autonomous Research. He expects the auto pullback to shave roughly one percentage point off Wells Fargo's net interest income growth over time. The bank's executives have acknowledged that tightening of standards comes at a price.  Wells Fargo is willing to give up volume and share in order to protect its balance sheet from credit risk,  Franklin Codel, the bank's head of consumer lending, told the bank's investor day in May. At the same event, Chief Executive Officer Tim Sloan singled out auto loans as the business with the biggest potential for a  negative credit event.  A Wells Fargo spokeswoman declined to comment for this story beyond what executives have already said about auto lending. As Wells Fargo's auto loan originations have dropped, it has slipped to No. 7 from No. 2 among top U.S. auto lenders, according to Experian Automotive. The bank also began a revamp of its auto business early this year as part of a broad overhaul following a sales scandal that has roiled the third-largest U.S. bank by assets. In April, Laura Schupbach took over management of the auto business, months after her predecessor, Dawn Martin Harp, announced plans to leave. Schupbach is a 22-year Wells Fargo veteran who most recently ran its insurance business after various roles in finance and expenses, according to her corporate biography. Weeks later, the bank began the process of moving collections staff from 57 locations across the country to three central hubs in Raleigh, North Carolina, Irving, Texas and Chandler, Arizona, according to an internal memo viewed by Reuters. People with knowledge of the business say hundreds of positions will likely be eliminated. A bank spokeswoman declined to say how many jobs might be lost, and would not authorize an interview with Schupbach. Martin Harp could not be reached. Less Independence The auto lending shake-up, some details of which were first reported by Auto Finance News, is the latest indication that Wells Fargo's top management is seeking greater control over businesses that traditionally operated with much independence. In interviews, three people who have worked inside the auto lending operation raised questions about what impact the abandoning of the  run it like you own it  philosophy will have in the long term. In recent years auto lending delivered nearly twice as much in revenue per dollar of expenses as the overall bank, according to people familiar with the numbers. They attributed the performance to tight cost controls and the operational independence that was once a source of pride for Wells Fargo. But that business model has come under scrutiny after revelations that thousands of branch employees created as many as 2.1 million accounts to hit aggressive sales targets. Following an internal investigation, Wells Fargo's directors released a report in April recommending tighter and more centralized risk management. Since then, Wells has begun moving 5,200 risk employees from business units to one  corporate risk  division. Although the changes could make businesses less nimble, tighter controls were inevitable, said Marty Mosby, analyst at Vining Sparks.  It was hard for them to give up that last piece of who they really were,  he said.  That's what made them more profitable than the other bank.

The United States has plenty of idle equipment laying around after its own unconventional drilling boom cooled. But moving that machinery from the plains of Texas to the windswept Patagonian desert is proving complex and costly for global oil majors who say Argentina's protectionist past is slowing efforts to spark its own shale revolution. A move by Argentina's government to cut import taxes on used oil-field equipment has sparked fierce opposition from local manufacturers, who are lobbying the government to include protections for them in a measure they fear will destroy their livelihoods.  Among them is Adrian Ramos, president of QM Equipment, a manufacturer of drilling and fracking equipment located in the Argentine coastal city of Mar del Plata.   We got in touch with [the Production Ministry] and let them know it was totally impossible for us to survive this,  Ramos told Reuters in a telephone interview. Negotiations with Ramos and others have slowed the rollout of tariff reductions. President Mauricio Macri in April had promised oil executives the changes would be coming within  weeks.  The previously unreported talks with local manufacturers underscore the challenges faced by Macri, who came to power in 2015 on a wave of popular discontent that ended 12 years of leftist rule. The market-friendly former businessman has pledged to revive Argentina's moribund, inflation-racked economy by reducing trade barriers and wooing foreign investment.  But he has gotten blowback from industries and unions that have benefited from protectionist policies. With mid-term elections approaching in October, popular opposition to rising imports and factory layoffs has become a vulnerability for Macri's  Let's Change  coalition. Big oil firms, meanwhile, are fuming too. Vaca Muerta, a Belgium-sized shale formation located in the western Patagonian province of Neuquen, is seen as the most promising unconventional oil and gas field outside of North America, the birthplace of the shale revolution.  Already burdened with pricey labor and transport costs in Argentina, companies have grown frustrated with delays in the equipment import reform. Speaking at an industry event in Buenos Aires in late June, Richard Spies, chief executive of Pan America Energy, an Argentine subsidiary of BP PLC, called on government officials to hit the accelerator.  Get these things done,  Spies said.  We need that equipment that's idle in the United States moved down here to facilitate the developments that are coming in Vaca Muerta.  In an emailed response to questions from Reuters, a Production Ministry spokesman said the import proposal was advancing and a decree would be passed by the executive branch in the coming weeks. It would not need congressional approval, the spokesman said. Bringing The  Dead Cow  to Life A drilling rig is seen at the Loma Campana Vaca Muerta shale oil and gas drilling site, own by Argentina's state-controlled energy company YPF, in the Patagonian province of Neuquen, Argentina June 22, 2017.Juliana CastillaArgentina is one of many resource-rich Latin American countries that have struggled to develop abundant oil and mineral reserves. Rules aimed at protecting domestic players and guaranteeing large revenues for government have chased away some foreign investors.  New right-leaning governments in the region have introduced business-friendly policies to lure them back. Brazil's Congress in 2016 opened the nation's deepwater pre-salt fields to foreign operators. This year Peru lowered air-quality standards to attract mining investment. Spurring development of Vaca Muerta - Spanish for 'Dead Cow' - is one of Macri's major priorities as he tries to unwind regulations put in place by his predecessor Cristina Fernandez. Argentina holds the world's second-largest shale gas reserves, but it imports a quarter of its energy needs, one reason for the country's $7-billion current account deficit. Macri has promised rail and pipeline projects to connect remote Vaca Muerta to markets and ports. Most crucially, he struck a deal with unions in January to reduce notoriously high labor costs. Still, production costs remain well above those of global competitors. Prices at the Loma Campana field, jointly operated by state-run oil company YPF SA and Chevron Corp exceed $43 per barrel, compared with $32 in the Niobrara in Colorado and Wyoming. (For a look at Argentine shale activity, see tmsnrt.rs/2uPm98U)     Used oil equipment can currently be imported at tariffs ranging from 7 percent to 28 percent, with imports of some types of machinery banned, the Energy Ministry said in an emailed statement to Reuters.  The proposed change would eliminate the bans, lower tariffs to between 0 percent and 7 percent and provide a form of compensation for companies that buy locally produced equipment, the Ministry said. It added that it has been meeting with drillers, oil services companies and local manufacturers about the rule.   Evidently this dialogue process has taken time,  a ministry spokesman wrote.  We expect the decree to be signed soon.    Compete or 'Disappear' Local companies fear the changes could be devastating.  Everaldo Santa Cruz is head of the oil and gas business at HTI SA, a maker of drilling and hydraulic fracturing equipment in Canuelas, Buenos Aires province. He said HTI has invested heavily in building frac pumps to supply drillers in Vaca Muerta, and that the $1.2 million price tag is comparable with that of U.S. manufacturers. But Santa Cruz said he worries he will never get to fully develop that part of his business if the decree is passed. HTI doesn't stand a chance if his customers are allowed to import equipment they already own from the United States, paying only transport costs and the lowered tariffs, he said.   We understand that it can speed up production to an extent,  Santa Cruz said.  But there's a risk that companies like ours that try to develop local solutions to support the industry simply disappear.

Yellen will give her semi-annual monetary policy testimony before Congress later on Wednesday and on Thursday, and investors will be parsing it for or clues on when the Fed will start reducing its massive balance sheet. Her remarks will follow words from Fed Governor Lael Brainard that disappointed some dollar bulls. The dollar index, which measures the U.S. currency against a basket of six major rivals, was down 0.1 percent on the day at 95.551. The euro added 0.2 percent to $1.14865, after rising as high as $1.14885, its loftiest peak since May 2016. Against its Japanese counterpart, the dollar skidded 0.5 percent to 113.40 yen, more than a whole yen below a four-month high of 114.495 yen marked on Tuesday. Emails released by Donald Trump Jr. on Tuesday showed he agreed last year to meet a woman he was told was a Russian government lawyer who might have damaging information about Democratic White House rival Hillary Clinton as part of Moscow's official support for his father. The meeting could lead investigators to probe whether he violated U.S. election law, experts said. Investors' mood turned more hopeful later in the session after U.S. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell announced a two-week delay in the Senate's August recess to provide more time to work on legislation and approve nominees, which could lead to progress on tax reform and fiscal stimulus. Even after the news of the longer session,  the U.S. dollar did not return to beginning-of-the-day levels,  said Bill Northey, chief investment officer at U.S. Bancorp Wealth Management in Helena, Montana. While the dollar was buffeted by the political headlines, it remains underpinned against the yen by divergent monetary policy expectations for the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan, he said.  Central banks around the globe seem to be either removing their accommodation or talking about removing their accommodation, except for the BOJ,  said Northey. Ahead of Yellen's remarks, Brainard said the central bank should soon begin reducing its balance sheet, as long as economic data on U.S. jobs and growth holds up. But she wasn't as hawkish as some investors hoped, saying that once balance sheet reduction is under way, she will assess inflation before deciding on further interest rate increases.  I didn't think Brainard's comments would continue to have an influence in the Tokyo session, but the market seems to have weaker expectations of the Fed's tightening, and U.S. Treasury yields are dropping,  undermining the dollar, said Masashi Murata, senior currency strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman in Tokyo. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield stood at 2.353 percent in Asian trading, below its close on Tuesday of 2.362 percent. Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker, a voter on the Federal Open Market Committee, said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday that if inflation did not move toward the Fed's 2 percent target, then this would be a reason to hold off raising rates. The Canadian dollar was slightly higher against its U.S. counterpart as investors awaited a Bank of Canada interest rate decision later on Wednesday. While forecasters remain divided on whether the central bank will raise rates, data from the overnight index swaps market showed that money markets have priced in a hike, as well as a second hike before the end of the year.

Liu, 61, is being treated for worsening liver function, septic shock and organ dysfunction, and remains on dialysis, the hospital in the northeastern city of Shenyang said in a short online statement, its latest update. Liu was jailed for 11 years in 2009 for  inciting subversion of state power  after helping to write a petition known as  Charter 08  calling for sweeping political reforms. He was recently moved from jail to a hospital to be treated for late-stage liver cancer. Rights groups and Western government have urged China to allow Liu and his wife, Liu Xia, to leave the country to be treated abroad, as Liu has said he wants to. Liu's friends have voiced suspicion over the hospital's statements, which suggest a worsening of his condition soon after two foreign doctors said he was well enough to travel abroad.  We do not know how reliable these accounts are, or if they mean Liu Xiaobo cannot travel,  a friend of Liu's family told Reuters, declining to be identified because of the sensitivity of the situation. No one answered the telephone at the hospital's publicity department on Wednesday. The  confrontational tone  of those in the West voicing their opinions on Liu failed to focus on his illness, the state-backed Global Times tabloid said on Wednesday.  China has already taken the feelings of relevant Western forces into consideration, and has no obligation to meet their unreasonable demands,  it said in an English-language editorial. Two doctors from the United States and Germany who visited Liu on Saturday later said they considered it safe for him to be moved overseas for treatment, but such a move must happen as quickly as possible. After the doctors' Sunday statement, China released short videos of their visit, apparently taken without their knowledge, in which the German doctor appeared to praise the care Liu had received from the Chinese doctors. On Monday, the German embassy in Beijing said in a statement the release of the videos went against Germany's wishes and suggested,  Security organs are steering the process, not medical experts.  Asked about Germany's statement, the foreign ministry on Tuesday said it did not know anything about the issues raised, reiterating its position that countries should not interfere in China's internal affairs.

For Trump, who has been swept up all year in crises of his own making, this time the target was his eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., whose meeting with a Russian lawyer last year led to accusations that the president's son entertained working with Russians to spread negative information about Democrat Hillary Clinton.  Among Trump's wide-ranging group of outside advisers and former campaign officials, Donald Jr.'s meeting with the lawyer on the expectation of gaining access to negative information on Clinton was seen as problematic, a demonstration of the son's political inexperience, but not illegal.  You can't shrug this off even though you know he's very likely going to be okay,  said an outside Trump adviser, who asked to remain unidentified.  This is the president's namesake and you have to circle the wagons in defense of the president's son.   There's no question in my mind that every person in the White House has some level of concern about this. Otherwise it's malpractice,  the adviser said. Inside the White House, the mood was one of heavy acceptance that another political problem had emerged but also of caution as to its significance for a wider probe into Russia's meddling in the election and whether there was collusion with the Trump campaign. Benumbed by previous crises from the firing of then-FBI Director James Comey to the appointment of a special prosecutor, White House officials showed no signs of panic and said they were trying to advance the president's agenda. The new incident erupted as Trump seemingly enjoyed a rare moment of calm. His trip to Warsaw and Hamburg last week went fairly smoothly, although critics accused him of not being tough enough in his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. On Wednesday, he is to depart to Paris for talks with French President Emmanuel Macron and to participate in flag-waving Bastille Day ceremonies. Trump himself was described by the White House as frustrated by yet another distraction involving the Russia investigation.  He knows that he didn't do anything and he really wants to focus on the good things that are happening and the things he was elected to do, and he doesn't like it when things get in the way,  a senior White House official said. The president offered a restrained reaction, not resorting to Twitter to launch a tirade against his critics, but issuing a brief statement praising his  high-quality person  who showed  transparency  by releasing the email chain with the lawyer on Tuesday.  There was a sense among former campaign advisers that Donald Trump Jr. had shown his political naivete by agreeing to the meeting. They noted that it took place at a time when Trump had a barebones staff and that his family members, initially reluctant to getting involved in his campaign, were searching to carve out space for themselves.  Besides proving that he was gullible and he got snookered, it's still not a smoking gun,  said one former campaign adviser. Among even Republicans, there was dismay at the turn of events. Conservative author Quin Hillyer wrote in a blog post that Trump should step down for cozying up to Russia. (The blog link is here)   The American people absolutely cannot trust Trump’s objectivity about Russian intentions and Russian actions,  Hillyer wrote.  This is an utterly untenable situation. For the good of the country, Trump must lance the boil, and resign.  The outside Trump adviser said the Trump Jr. case  unfortunately supports the narrative  advanced by Trump's Democratic opponents and propagated by what Trump world feels is a left-leaning news media.  Donald Jr. is the nicest of nice guys, genuinely authentic,  the adviser said.  A lot of us are disappointed that if it had to be somebody, why did it have to be Don Jr.?

Taiwan was monitoring the situation, had detected nothing unusual and people should not be alarmed, it added. The Soviet-built Liaoning, China's first aircraft carrier, had been in Hong Kong for events marking the 20th anniversary of the territory's return to Chinese rule from Britain. It was the fourth time that the Liaoning has sailed near self-ruled Taiwan, which China claims as its own, in recent months for what Beijing has said were routine drills. Earlier this month Taiwan scrambled jets to shadow the carrier as it made its way to Hong Kong.

The United Nations University (UNU) said financial tools were a powerful means to disrupt the flow of money generated from human trafficking, with the illegal industry estimated to be worth about $150 billion a year. As many as 45.8 million people, most of them women and girls, are estimated to be enslaved globally, according to the 2016 Global Slavery Index by rights group Walk Free Foundation. They are typically forced to work in factories, mines and farms, sold for sex, trapped in debt bondage or born into servitude. Money generated by human trafficking comes from crime and handling those funds can be considered money laundering or, in some cases, financing terrorism, the UNU report said.  Human trafficking is both big business and a serious crime,  said James Cockayne, head of the UNU Office at the United Nations and author of the report, in an accompanying statement.  Disrupting the associated financial flows associated with these crimes will make a powerful contribution to improving these lives and preventing future crimes.  Financial institutions could help identify money couriers as well as so-called  straw men  used to conceal identities and cash-intensive businesses that typically play roles in human trafficking networks, the report said. Risk assessment maps, due diligence procedures, information sharing and protecting whistleblowers are among the tools available to banks, private investors, credit risk agencies, institutional investors and regulators, it said.  Relatively little attention has been paid to the role of the financial sector in efforts to tackle human trafficking and modern slavery, helping to make these crimes relatively low risk and high reward for perpetrators - and, arguably, for banks, other financial intermediaries and investors,  the report said. Also, most financial institutions have a limited understanding of the financial aspects of human trafficking and their risk of exposure, it said. That is beginning to change, as corruption, bribery and trafficking are increasingly seen as linked, said Archana Kotecha, head of the legal department at Liberty Asia, an anti-slavery charity, and a contributor to the report.  It is only very recently that the three have started to come together and people to understand that you have to not simply view slavery as a gross human rights violation but as an illicit business,  she said at a U.N. event held to release the report. Obstacles may include laws protecting privacy and confidentiality, technical issues or rules regarding defamation or libel, said the report, entitled  25 Keys to Unlock the Financial Chains of Human Trafficking & Modern Slavery.  In the United States, legislation was introduced in May in Congress that would boost financial regulations to help identify and report trafficking and help deny traffickers access to the financial system.

Trump and Macron -- both political newcomers who scored upset victories in their presidential elections -- have taken very different positions in areas such as climate change and trade. U.S. and French officials have said Trump's visit to Paris will allow the leaders to focus on those places where their interests overlap, including resolving the conflict in Syria and combating global terrorism. Macron invited Trump to France to celebrate July 14 Bastille Day festivities and to commemorate the 100 years since U.S. troops entered into World War One.  It's for France a unique opportunity to show French military power ... and that's very important for Trump,  said Alexandra de Hoop Scheffer, director of the Paris office of think-tank the German Marshall Fund. Trump has repeatedly hammered away at European allies in NATO for not paying their fair share on military spending. Although France has not met NATO's target of spending 2 percent of GDP on the military, Trump is satisfied that the country is very close to meeting that goal, a White House official said on Tuesday.   Trump will arrive in Paris early Thursday morning. He will participate in a welcoming ceremony at Les Invalides, where he will tour a French war museum and visit the tomb of Napoleon. Then Trump and Macron will hold a bilateral meeting followed by a news conference, the White House said.  Macron and Trump, along with their wives, plan to dine at a restaurant in the Eiffel Tower Thursday night.  Trump's brief trip to France follows his attendance of the G20 meeting in Hamburg, Germany last week. The United States was left relatively isolated during the summit, when it reaffirmed Trump's decision to pull out of a landmark international accord reached in Paris in 2015 to fight climate change. In hard-fought negotiations in Germany, Macron tried to soften U.S. language on climate policy.   They have completely contrasting messages, where Trump has argued for 'America first,' Emmanuel Macron is arguing for a kind of cosmopolitan globalist vision of France and of Europe,  said Erik Jones, director of European and Eurasian Studies at Johns Hopkins University.   That is going to create very sharp contrast when the two meet in France,  Jones said.

U.S. consulting firm AlixPartners also said China is aiming to have nearly two-thirds of the world's manufacturing capacity for lithium-ion batteries by 2021, and is investing to support current sales of domestic-brand electric vehicles in the world's largest car market.  Already, Chinese automakers account for 96 percent of the electric vehicles sold in the country, AlixPartners said. Automakers sold about 350,000 electric vehicles in China in 2016 - still less than 2 percent of total vehicle sales.  By 2025, electric vehicle batteries should be close to even with internal combustion engines in terms of production costs, AlixPartners forecast. Lower battery costs could help boost consumer acceptance. John Hoffecker, the firm's global vice chairman, told reporters at the Automotive Press Association in Detroit on Tuesday that other factors, such as a significant reduction of the time it takes to recharge electric car batteries, will be critical to efforts to win over reluctant consumers. AlixPartners also cautioned that many of the roughly 50 companies it counts as contestants in the race to develop self-driving cars won't go the distance.  It's impossible to believe there will be 50 successful autonomous vehicle companies,  Hoffecker said.  In the United States, AlixPartners said automakers will have to contend with funding investments in new technology against deep-pocketed technology industry players such as Apple Inc and Alphabet Inc, even as sales of cars and light trucks slide into a cyclical trough. AlixPartners is forecasting that U.S. car and light truck sales will fall to 15.2 million vehicles in 2019, down 13 percent from the 2016 peak. Other U.S. analysts also predict a slowdown in vehicle sales during the next two to three years.

About a third of people in developing-world cities live in informal settlements, where they often lack access to basic services, said a report from the Washington-based World Resources Institute (WRI).  Globally, 1.6 billion people in urban areas are expected to need affordable homes by 2025, up from 1.2 billion today, as cities attract more migrants, it added. “We think it’s a crisis when one-in-three households - one-in-three citizens that live in cities - don’t have adequate, secure or affordable housing,” said Robin King of WRI’s Ross Center for Sustainable Cities. According to the report, 56 percent of Africa’s urban population live in slums – rising as high as 90 percent in some countries like Ghana - while in India, it is 24 percent.  Report co-author King told the Thomson Reuters Foundation that if action does not begin now in some cities in Africa and South Asia, “the problem will be much, much worse”.   Mid-sized cities in particular, which tend to have the fastest expansion rates, need to respond quickly before it’s too late, she added. Improved housing would help boost cities’ economic growth, reduce their environmental impact and lower social inequality, the report said. Moving families from slums to poorly serviced new communities on the fringes of sprawling cities has often left them isolated and with limited job options, forcing them to undertake costly commutes each day for work, it said. To cope with the housing shortage, slums should be made part of the solution by involving residents in programs to upgrade them and providing better safety, jobs, health and education, it added. Schemes are underway to improve favelas in Rio de Janeiro and slums in Indonesia, for example. “Poor people can improve their lives through incremental upgrading of their homes - and that can only be possible if they feel some sense of security,” said Sheela Patel, chair of Shack/Slum Dwellers International, a network of community-based groups for the urban poor. For that to happen, governments must provide amenities and ensure land tenure, she told a call for journalists.  'Backyard' Rentals Revamping and strengthening the home rental market while offering rent subsidies could help informal workers struggling to meet requirements for entry-level home loans, said WRI. Ways to open up more shelter in cities include regulations to better protect tenants and landlords, easier access to arbitration, and rule changes so that people can rent a single room or even “hot-bed” for a few hours, said the report. Moves by South Africa’s Gauteng province to legalize hundreds of thousands of “backyard rentals” - often shacks or rooms tacked onto the backs of houses - have helped ease Johannesburg’s housing problem, said WRI.  Rent-to-own deals and collective ownership schemes can also expand choices, it added. Other options to help poor people find affordable homes include incentives for developers to build low-cost housing as part of urban regeneration schemes and techniques to increase housing density like those used in São Paulo. “Land in cities is worth an awful lot, especially (in) fast-growing cities, even if incomes are low,” said Diana Mitlin, professor of urban development at Britain’s University of Manchester. “There is often a problem in ensuring well-located land is allocated to low-income groups.” Reporting by Sophie Hares; editing by Megan Rowling.

U.S. consulting firm AlixPartners also said China is aiming to have nearly two-thirds of the world's manufacturing capacity for lithium-ion batteries by 2021, and is investing to support current sales of domestic-brand electric vehicles in the world's largest car market.  Already, Chinese automakers account for 96 percent of the electric vehicles sold in the country, AlixPartners said. Automakers sold about 350,000 electric vehicles in China in 2016 - still less than 2 percent of total vehicle sales.  By 2025, electric vehicle batteries should be close to even with internal combustion engines in terms of production costs, AlixPartners forecast. Lower battery costs could help boost consumer acceptance. John Hoffecker, the firm's global vice chairman, told reporters at the Automotive Press Association in Detroit on Tuesday that other factors, such as a significant reduction of the time it takes to recharge electric car batteries, will be critical to efforts to win over reluctant consumers. AlixPartners also cautioned that many of the roughly 50 companies it counts as contestants in the race to develop self-driving cars won't go the distance.  It's impossible to believe there will be 50 successful autonomous vehicle companies,  Hoffecker said.  In the United States, AlixPartners said automakers will have to contend with funding investments in new technology against deep-pocketed technology industry players such as Apple Inc and Alphabet Inc, even as sales of cars and light trucks slide into a cyclical trough. AlixPartners is forecasting that U.S. car and light truck sales will fall to 15.2 million vehicles in 2019, down 13 percent from the 2016 peak. Other U.S. analysts also predict a slowdown in vehicle sales during the next two to three years.

Economists polled by Reuters had forecast May output growth to remain unchanged at 4.2 percent for the second month in a row.     The robust factory output was supported by strength in the manufacturing and electricity sectors, according to data from the Statistics Department.     Manufacturing output grew 7.3 percent from a year earlier, while electricity output rose 2.5 percent, the data showed. Mining output, however, declined.      Malaysia's exports surged again in May, rising 32.5 percent from a year earlier on rising demand from China and strong shipments of manufactured goods.
