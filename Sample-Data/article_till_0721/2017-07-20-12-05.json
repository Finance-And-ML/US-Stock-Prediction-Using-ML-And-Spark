Now Uncle Sam is going to get paid.Steven Cohen       is\u00a0one of many managers\u00a0preparing\u00a0to write\u00a0huge checks\u00a0in early 2018\u00a0due to\u00a0a crisis-era decision\u00a0to close\u00a0a tax loophole that long benefited\u00a0some of\u00a0Wall Street\u2019s wealthiest investors.The billionaire founder of SAC Capital Advisors LP\u00a0amassed deferred offshore income of more than $1 billion likely subject to\u00a0the\u00a0taxation, said people familiar with the matter.\u00a0Other hedge-fund managers facing personal tax bills of over $100 million include       David Einhorn       of Greenlight Capital Inc. and       Daniel Loeb       of\u00a0Third Point LLC, said people familiar.Total payments from all managers could amount to $25 billion, according to\u00a0a 2008\u00a0estimate from the Joint Committee on Taxation. Some tax specialists say the bill could be even higher: $100 billion or more.This will likely mean a surge of tax revenue for Connecticut, historically the center of the hedge-fund industry. The state isn\u2019t yet sure how much it will reap, said a spokesman for the governor\u2019s budget office.\u201cAny projection would be too speculative to be reliable,\u201d the spokesman said.Hedge-fund\u00a0managers\u00a0are considering a variety of steps to raise cash or soften the tax blow. Some\u00a0will trim stakes in their funds to raise cash, says Brett Barth of hedge-fund investor BBR Partners LLC.Hedge funds often invest\u00a0through\u00a0vehicles\u00a0based inside and outside the U.S. They make money from their cut of 20% or more of trading profits.For decades, the Internal Revenue Service allowed managers of offshore funds to defer receipt of this compensation and both avoid an immediate tax bill and grow the savings tax-free. The IRS generally permits businesses to allow executives to defer compensation because such deferrals lower the firms\u2019 compensation costs, forcing them to pay higher taxes on profits. That offsets income taxes not immediately paid by employees.But this practice cost the Treasury income in the case of offshore hedge funds that don\u2019t pay any offsetting U.S. taxes.Managers\u00a0in some cases let those deferred trading fees compound\u00a0tax-free\u00a0for 10 years or longer.\u00a0Some also deferred management fees, even as\u00a0they amassed large fortunes from gains earned by their U.S.-based funds.\u201cThey kept rolling and rolling the money,\u201d says Richard Zarin, a partner at Morgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP.The             New York Times                   in 2007 highlighted this loophole, and Congress overwhelmingly voted to close it the following year as a way of raising revenue and stabilizing the financial sector during the 2008 financial crisis. The change, part of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of October 2008, was made in section 457A of the IRS code.The legislation gave managers a decade to pay taxes on money accumulated before the law changed. That deadline is now nine months away.The deferred fees\u00a0will be taxed at ordinary tax rates that can be close to 50% depending on where the managers live and work,\u00a0according to tax experts.\u201cThese are smart, aggressive people who don\u2019t want to pay more than they have to and writing a huge check can be quite demoralizing,\" said\u00a0Jonathan Brenner, a tax partner\u00a0at Caplin & Drysdale. \u201cMost recognize they\u2019ve had a good run and now have to pay the piper, though not after first asking six different ways if there\u2019s some silver bullet\u201d to eliminate or reduce the taxes.Mr. Cohen, who ran SAC Capital before it pleaded guilty to criminal insider-trading charges in 2013, is nearing a launch of a new firm to manage as much as $20 billion, The Wall Street Journal earlier reported.He has set that target, which would exceed the $16 billion managed at peak by SAC, partly because he wants to generate income to help pay the large tax bill, a person close to him said.Other\u00a0fund managers\u00a0are shifting headquarters to Florida to mitigate the tax impact, said a local official. Florida doesn\u2019t have a state income tax\u00a0on personal income.\u201cEven four or five years ago they saw this coming, they knew they\u2019d bring money back in and needed to be in a state with lower taxes,\u201d said       Kelly Smallridge,        president of the Business Development Board of Palm Beach County.Those moves are no guarantee of a smaller tax\u00a0bite\u00a0because states\u00a0generally examine where and when deferred compensation was earned, experts say.\u201cPeople have been banging on our doors since the provision was enacted looking for a solution and we still have clients coming in, but one hasn\u2019t been found,\u201d\u00a0says Mr. Brenner. \u201cEvery tax lawyer who touches hedge funds has had these kinds of calls\u2026there\u2019s\u00a0frustration among some clients that a solution has not been found.\u201dSome charities\u00a0say\u00a0managers anticipating a tax bite\u00a0are discussing donations\u2014to receive an immediate tax deduction\u2014rather than handing money to\u00a0the government.Other\u00a0managers are turning to charitable lead annuity trusts, said       Henry Bregstein,        an attorney at Katten Muchin Rosenman LLP. These trusts give a donor an upfront deduction of 100% as well as the opportunity to transfer to heirs,\u00a0free of gift and estate tax,\u00a0the trust\u2019s remaining value at the term\u2019s end after making annual, fixed distributions to charities.Eileen Heisman, chief executive officer of National Philanthropic Trust says her organization is speaking to roughly 50 fund managers about establishing donor-advised funds by the end of year, three-times the usual pace. She attributes the increase to the looming tax bills.Such funds make grants to charities on behalf of donors after they contribute assets, enabling immediate tax deductions. Assets can be invested and grow tax-free even before the charities are chosen.Sometimes, these funds can be invested in the manager\u2019s own funds, with restrictions, Ms. Heisman says.\u201cThere\u2019s no way of knowing how much\u201d money will be paid in taxes or how much will be shifted to charitable organizations, says Ms. Heisman. \u201cBut we think it will be very large.\u201dWrite to Gregory Zuckerman at gregory.zuckerman@wsj.com and Rob Copeland at rob.copeland@wsj.com", "news_title": "Loophole Closed: Hedge-Fund Managers Prepare Huge Tax Checks", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/loophole-closed-hedge-fund-managers-prepare-huge-tax-checks-1500543002"}, {"news_time": "2017-07-20 07:00:00", "keywords": "Gary Lebbin,Lawrence Rybka,commodity,financial market news,insurance,life insurance,financial services", "content": "When       Gary Lebbin       turns 100 years old in September, hanging over any celebration will be one very costly fact: His life insurer aims to cancel two policies totaling $3.2 million in death benefits.The Lebbin family has run up against a provision that exists in many life-insurance policies. Policies have expiration dates, and the one in the Lebbin family\u2019s two contracts is age 100 for the policyholder.It is a standard feature of permanent life insurance, a product combining a tax-deferred savings component with a tax-free death-benefit. The provision calls for the termination of the death benefit and payout of all of the built-up savings when the policyholder reaches the specified age.The limits weren\u2019t an issue in the many decades when very few people lived beyond 100. But they increasingly are a problem for the U.S. life-insurance industry as more people become centenarians. There were an estimated 53,364 centenarians in the U.S. as of 2010, up from 37,306 in 1990 and 32,194 in 1980, according to a U.S. Census report published in December 2012.Since the mid- to late-2000s, the industry has used age 121 as the standard maturity date in new contracts. But an unknown number of older contracts with the 100-year-old limit remain in consumers\u2019 hands. Some insurers previously offered older policyholders the opportunity to extend the age in their older policies with varying financial terms.The Lebbin family\u2019s insurer, a unit of Transamerica Corp., didn\u2019t offer an extension.Lawrence Rybka,        president of insurance brokerage Valmark Financial Group in Akron, Ohio, worries many people may unexpectedly lose out. At least seven people have recently contacted his firm with questions about older policies with maturity dates of 95 to 100 years. \u201cContract language of this type was common practice,\u201d he said.Faced with the potential loss of coverage, Mr. Lebbin\u2019s family filed suit in federal court in Maryland earlier this month, accusing Transamerica of knowingly using a too-low age at the time of sale in the early 1990s. The suit also alleges the insurer improperly marketed the policies as \u201ccoverage for life.\u201dThe federal-court lawsuit says the Lebbins paid Transamerica more than $1.5 million in premiums over the years. It seeks revision of the contracts to allow coverage until Mr. Lebbin\u2019s death. It also seeks an award including punitive and other damages.In a statement, Transamerica, a unit of the Netherlands\u2019s             Aegon                   NV, says it acted properly.\u201cWe understand that Mr. Lebbin is disappointed that his life insurance coverage will shortly come to an end. However, his policies, according to their terms, pay benefits only if he were to pass away before the policies\u2019 anniversaries nearest age 100\u2026We take seriously our obligations to the millions of customers who rely on the solutions we provide and we abide fully by the terms and conditions of our policy contracts,\u201d according to the statement.In terminating the policy, Transamerica said it would pay Mr. Lebbin the built-up \u201cnet cash value,\u201d or savings. That is as per contractual terms.It is unclear how much cash value there is, said       James Bainbridge,        a lawyer for the family. Industrywide, many of these policies have performed poorly in recent years because interest buildup is tied to the insurers\u2019 bond investments, and low interest rates have had a punishing effect. Upon termination of the policies, the Lebbin family would collect less money and potentially pay taxes, while a future $3.2 million death benefit would be tax-free, Mr. Bainbridge said.\u201cTransamerica has a public-relations problem because it didn\u2019t think ahead and offer policyholders like these\u201d options at an earlier stage to deal with the looming age issue, said       Todd Erkis,        a former chief actuary at             Lincoln National Corp.       and a visiting professor at St. Joseph\u2019s University.Ironically, policy maturity dates were born as a way to help consumers get a reasonable value out of a policy after years of ownership but before a death, said       Paul Graham,        a senior actuary with the American Council of Life Insurers. To calculate monetary values and set annual premium levels, \u201cyou have to have an end point,\u201d he said.By the mid 2000s, a new mortality table was available that established 121 as the new maturity age to help prevent an abundance of policies maturing before death, according to Mr. Graham.\u201cThe agents didn\u2019t want the policies maturing before people were dying, the companies didn\u2019t want it happening, and policyholders didn\u2019t want it happening,\u201d he said.The policies taken out by the Lebbins are called universal life. They are a popular form of permanent life insurance. Permanent life stands in contrast to basic \u201cterm\u201d life, which is sold to provide a payout if a death occurs within a specified period of time, usually 10 to 30 years.The suit alleges Transamerica marketed the policies as coverage that would insure the Lebbins for life and would guarantee they would have tax-free income with which their heirs could pay estate taxes. The lawsuit maintains that Transamerica established the maturity date with a 1980 mortality table \u201cdespite the fact that it was outdated and not an accurate reflection of the actual life expectancies of its customers.\u201dThe Lebbins became aware last year of Transamerica\u2019s intention to terminate the policies and unsuccessfully sought an extension of the contracts until Mr. Lebbin\u2019s death, the lawsuit says.Mr. Lebbin was born on Sept. 6, 1917, in Berlin. He came to the U.S. in 1938 to escape Nazi persecution, according to his son-in-law       Phillip Spector.      \u00a0From arriving penniless, he founded a paint-manufacturing business in the 1940s and ultimately had more than 50 retail outlets in the Baltimore-Washington area.He married in 1944. Bernice Lebbin died in 2015.\u201cCentenarians are cherished and routinely honored by local communities and governments,\u201d said Mr. Bainbridge, the lawyer. \u201cCentenarians, however, are problematic for the life-insurance industry.\u201dWrite to Leslie Scism at leslie.scism@wsj.com", "news_title": "Happy 100th Birthday!
