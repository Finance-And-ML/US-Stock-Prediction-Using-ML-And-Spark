ROK is the abbreviation for South Korea\u2019s formal name, the Republic of Korea.Late Tuesday, the Trump administration denounced North Korea and demanded global action after concluding Pyongyang had launched an intercontinental ballistic missile.Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said the U.S. \u201cstrongly condemns\u201d North Korea for the launch. \u201cTesting an ICBM represents a new escalation of the threat to the United States, our allies and partners, the region, and the world,\u201d he said.The development presents President Donald Trump with his biggest foreign-policy challenge and raises the potential costs of military action against Pyongyang. It comes as Mr. Trump has expressed frustration with China\u2019s inability to curb North Korea\u2019s\u2019 advancing weapons program.U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley on Tuesday requested an urgent U.N. Security Council meeting on North Korea, a spokesman said. A U.N. spokesman said the session would be held at 3 p.m. Wednesday. The U.S. requested that the meeting be open.The missile test is likely to push North Korea up the agenda Friday and Saturday at a meeting of leaders of the Group of 20 advanced nations in Germany, where Mr. Trump is set to hold a separate meeting with the leaders of Japan and South Korea.The Trump administration has sought to increase pressure on China, North Korea\u2019s top trading partner and ally, to take greater action to cut off Pyongyang\u2019s economic lifeline. Mr. Trump is set to meet Chinese President       Xi Jinping       at the G-20 summit in Hamburg.The missile, which North Korean state media identified as the Hwasong-14, or the Mars-14, was launched at 9 a.m. local time Tuesday from an airfield in the country\u2019s northwest. Leader       Kim Jong Un       oversaw the test, North Korean state media said.The missile, like others that Pyongyang has tested this year, was fired at a steep trajectory, reaching an altitude of about 1,740 miles before splashing down 580 miles away between Japan and the Korean Peninsula, according to North Korean state media. The numbers were in line with U.S., South Korean and Japanese military analyses, though the Pentagon initially identified the missile as an intermediate-range ballistic missile.\u201cAs a full-fledged nuclear power that has been possessed of the most powerful intercontinental ballistic rocket capable of hitting any part of the world, along with nuclear weapons, the DPRK will fundamentally put an end to the U.S. nuclear war threat and blackmail,\u201d North Korea\u2019s state media said, using an acronym for the country\u2019s formal name, the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea.Mr. Trump addressed a crowd of military guests Tuesday at the White House for the annual fireworks display, but didn\u2019t address the North Korean launch.Tuesday afternoon, the European Union said foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini would speak to her counterparts in coming days to discuss possible further U.N. Security Council measures and will consider additional unilateral EU sanctions against North Korea.The U.S. has tried to use a combination of punitive economic sanctions, diplomatic isolation and military pressure to check Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear-weapons ambitions.Washington has begun using so-called secondary sanctions, which target companies that do business with North Korea, to economically isolate the country, sanctioning one Chinese bank last week. Another last-resort U.S. move would be to eliminate travel by Americans to North Korea.China has been the main diplomatic hope for the U.S. But after the death last month of American student Otto Warmbier following 17 months of captivity in North Korea, Mr. Trump said in a June 20 Twitter message that China\u2019s efforts had \u201cnot worked out.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s Twitter posts have underscored the fluctuations in U.S. policy, as he wrote in a post after the launch that China should \u201cput a heavy move on North Korea and end this nonsense once and for all.\u201dNorth Korea announced the launch on state television in the early hours of Independence Day in the U.S. The regime has test-fired missiles on or around July 4 before, including in 2006 and 2009.Mr. Kim, in a statement carried Wednesday on North Korean state media, called Tuesday\u2019s ICBM test a \u201cpackage of gifts\u201d\u200bon U.S. Independence Day. He said it showed that the North\u2019s \u201cshowdown with the U.S. imperialists has reached its final phase.\u201dHe appeared to rule out any discussions on giving up its weapons programs, saying the North wouldn\u2019t \u201cput its nukes and ballistic rockets on the table of negotiations in any case.\u201dIf fired at a flatter trajectory, the missile would have a range of more than 4,100 miles, said David Wright, a physicist with the Union of Concerned Scientists\u2014enough to reach Alaska and parts of the Hawaiian archipelago, and the U.S. naval base in Guam.Uzi Rubin, an Israeli missile-defense engineer and former head of the country\u2019s Missile Defense Organization, said that based on a preliminary analysis, he believed the Hwasong-14 was capable of flying nearly 6,200 miles\u2014putting San Francisco in range.\u201cThe question of when they will be ready is immaterial,\u201d Mr. Rubin said in an interview. \u201cThey are ready.\u201dSome analysts cautioned that North Korea faces many technical hurdles before it has a fully operational nuclear-armed ICBM. Among the challenges is ensuring the missile can carry and detonate a warhead at a predetermined target.North Korea has said it can mount a nuclear bomb on a long-range missile, but opinion on that is divided.Markus Schiller, a rocket analyst with German space and defense consultancy ST Analytics, said North Korea faces several years of engineering work. \u201cTheir work is just starting.\u201dNorth Korea said the ICBM test showed that it had mastered the ability of its warheads to survive the strain of atmospheric re-entry\u2014a frequently cited hurdle for its missile-development program.\u200b\u201dDespite the harsh atmospheric re-entry conditions of having to face the heat reaching thousands of degrees centigrade, extreme overload and vibration, the nuclear warhead detonation control device successfully worked,\u201d Wednesday\u2019s state media report said.\u200bWhile North Korea has been able to threaten Japan and South Korea for years with shorter-range missiles, Tokyo and Seoul could rely on Washington\u2019s nuclear deterrent. But with San Francisco potentially at risk, those allies could start to doubt the U.S.\u2019s commitment, said Adam Mount, senior fellow with the left-leaning Center for American Progress think tank in Washington.\u201cWe could see this day coming, but it was politically easier to continue to insist that the problem could be solved and that the problem would be solved than to prepare for this eventuality,\u201d he said.In a tweet in January, Mr. Trump said that North Korea\u2019s development of a nuclear weapon capable of reaching parts of the U.S. \u201cwon\u2019t happen!\u201dSince Mr. Kim, the North\u2019s third-generation leader, took power at the end of 2011, Pyongyang has accelerated its missile-development program, adding new capabilities that have given it the ability to fire missiles farther and with less preparation time.The U.S. has weighed military options against North Korea since at least the early 1990s, though it appears to have decided in each case that it was too risky.\u201cI just don\u2019t see how it makes sense,\u201d says Daniel Pinkston, a North Korea specialist and professor at Troy University in South Korea. \u201cYou would initiate some military operation that is almost certainly going to fail, and it would unleash so many of the things that you\u2019d want to avoid.\u201dAmong those things, he said, were the bombardment by North Korea of Seoul, the South Korean capital, or nuclear war.North Korea\u2019s ability to threaten the continental U.S. could increase its leverage in potential negotiations, said Narushige Michishita, director of the Security and International Studies Program at the National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies in Tokyo. One objective often stated by North Korea: the removal of around 28,500 American troops in South Korea.Following a meeting in the Kremlin Tuesday between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping, Russia and China issued a joint statement saying the two countries agreed to promote a plan for North Korea to call a halt to further nuclear and missile tests while the U.S. and South Korea freeze large-scale military exercises.The U.S. has said before that there is no equivalency between legitimate U.S.-South Korean military maneuvers and North Korea\u2019s missile and nuclear tests, which violate United Nations resolutions.\u2014Kersten Zhang in Beijing and Nathan Hodge in Moscow contributed to this article.Write to Jonathan Cheng at jonathan.cheng@wsj.com and Alastair Gale at alastair.gale@wsj.comAppeared in the July 5, 2017, print edition as 'North Korea Missile Tensions Rise.'", "news_time": "2017-07-04 22:53:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/north-korea-missile-launch-hands-trump-foreign-policy-crisis-1499182303", "news_title": "North Korea Missile Launch Threatens U.S. Strategy in Asia", "keywords": "china government,icbm,missile test,north korea nuclear,north korea weapons,U.N.

But the combination of high usage and smaller boats has overwhelmed the system at times. On the most popular routes such as the Rockaway line connecting lower Manhattan with some of the city\u2019s beaches, hundreds are left to wait between 30 minutes and an hour for a boat with room to board on the weekends.Anthony Hogrebe, a spokesman for the city\u2019s Economic Development Corp., which oversees the ferry program, said NYC Ferry was \u201cdoing everything we can to serve as many riders as possible.\u201d The city and ferry operator had more than doubled the number of boats to the Rockaways in Queens on weekends, and had ordered more boats, he said.\u201cThe lines were not as long today as they were in the last couple of days,\u201d Mr. Hogrebe said Tuesday. \u201cBy running three departures an hour, they believe no one should have had to wait more than an hour to get to Rockaway.\u201dOn other ferry routes\u00a0Monday, things seemed to be going more smoothly. A group of bicycle-toting ferry riders heading to Governors Island hopped on without a wait, and travelers on a Manhattan-bound ferry coming from Brooklyn Bridge Park found plenty of room to spread out.At Pier 11, where hundreds of beachgoers stood in the hot sun waiting for the next boat, some contemplated whether they should have a called car service, but most said they were taking the long wait times in stride.While others stood around him, Lucas Piazza, 26, sat in a foldable beach chair waiting for the next boat to arrive. \u201cI\u2019m in it to win it,\u201d he said.Many said they were trying to avoid the subway, where delays have steeply risen during the past year, leading Gov.

North Korea has twice successfully launched a satellite from a three-stage ballistic rocket that has sufficient power to reach the U.S. west coast and could form the basis of an intercontinental ballistic missile.It also has test-launched its so-called Musudan missile, which is estimated to have a range of 3,000 kilometers to 4,000 kilometers, but North Korea appears to have struggled with the technology, failing several times before claiming one success in June 2016.It is also working on other technologies such as solid-fuel missiles that can be launched from the back of a truck with virtually no advance warning.All told, the North Koreans now have roughly a dozen different types of missiles that have been displayed\u2014an impressive feat for an isolated country with a population roughly a third the size of Iran, said Uzi\u00a0Rubin, an Israeli missile-defense engineer and former head of the country\u2019s Missile Defense Organization.\u201cI thought the Iranians had the most advanced missile program in what used to be called the Third World,\u201d he said, calling the North\u2019s progress \u201camazing\u201d\u2014and in particular its successful launch on Tuesday of its Hwasong-14, which Mr. Rubin classified as an intercontinental ballistic missile.\u201cThese are not stage props\u2014these are missiles that are working,\u201d he said.While the missile launched on Tuesday flew just 580 miles, it was fired at a steep trajectory and reached an altitude of roughly 1,740 miles.The U.S. Pacific Command in Hawaii identified the Tuesday launch as an intermediate-range ballistic missile, generally meaning a range of 3,000 kilometers to 5,500 kilometers. But David Wright, a physicist at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said that if fired at a more-standard trajectory, it\u00a0could have flown for more than 4,160 miles, and Mr. Rubin said it could have flown nearly 6,200 miles. That is more than enough to qualify as an ICBM.The distinction between an intermediate-range and intercontinental ballistic missile is important: The U.S. has forbidden ICBM tests by North Korea, though it is unclear how it will respond to Pyongyang\u2019s claim that it has carried one out.Pyongyang\u2019s claim that it has a viable ICBM could pressure the U.S. to bolster missile defenses. In May, the U.S. said it shot down a mock ICBM that was meant to simulate one of the potential threats that the U.S. faces.The successful test, which officials called the first live-fire test on a dummy ICBM, was the 17th test of the U.S.\u2019s ground-based missile defense system.

That means that when Congress returns next week, a vote could happen soon after if negotiations on changes to the bill are successful. The timing will depend on when lawmakers get an updated nonpartisan analysis of the latest version of the bill.Here\u2019s what to expect as the debate moves forward:Q: How did the Congressional Budget Office\u2019s analysis of the bill change the legislative dynamics?The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office released a report in late June that estimated 22 million more people would be uninsured over a decade under the Senate GOP health bill than under current law. The analysis also showed the bill would lower the federal deficit by $321 billion over 10 years.A similar CBO estimate for the increase in uninsured under the House bill weighed heavily on members of that chamber and played a large part in its failure there. The House eventually passed a revised bill\u2014before a CBO score was released.       Susan Collins       of Maine, a moderate Republican, voiced her opposition to the Senate bill after the CBO score came out last Monday.Less than 24 hours after the CBO report was released, Mr. McConnell delayed a vote on health care until after Congress\u2019s July 4 recess. GOP leaders had wanted to hold a vote last week but struggled to placate the party\u2019s different wings. President       Donald Trump       has urged the Senate to repeal the ACA in a stand-alone measure if lawmakers can\u2019t come to an agreement on the current health bill.Q: Which GOP Senators aren\u2019t ready to vote \u2018yes\u2019?To get a bill passed, Mr. McConnell can only afford to lose two votes from his slim, 52-48 majority. With no Democrats expected to vote for the measure, losing two Republican votes would lead to a 50-50 tie, with Vice President       Mike Pence       having to stand by to break a tie. As of now, at least nine Republicans said they are opposed to the Senate bill:Sen.       Rand Paul,        KentuckySen. Ted Cruz, TexasSen. Mike Lee, UtahSen. Ron Johnson, WisconsinSen. Susan Collins, MaineSen. Dean Heller, NevadaSen.       Shelley Moore Capito,        West VirginiaSen. Rob Portman, OhioSen. Jerry Moran, KansasConservatives say the Senate GOP plan doesn\u2019t go far enough to lower health-care costs for consumers, and that the Republicans should offer a more robust Obamacare repeal bill. Some, such as Mr. Cruz, are pushing an amendment that would let insurers that sell ACA-compliant plans to also sell cheaper policies that cover fewer benefits.Some of the centrist Republicans in opposition say the bill doesn\u2019t do enough to protect the Obamacare Medicaid expansion, while others are concerned about restrictions on funding for women\u2019s health organization Planned Parenthood, among other reasons.Q: So is the bill dead?No. Some of the more conservative members\u2014Messrs. Johnson, Lee and Cruz\u2014are seen as potentially more likely than the centrist members are to come around with some negotiation with the White House and GOP leadership. Those members and Mr. Paul say they are willing to negotiate. Some GOP senators have said they are open to keeping a tax on investment income, which would give senators more money to focus on making insurance more affordable. Mr. Paul may withhold support for anything less than an outright repeal of Obamacare, and the Senate isn\u2019t eager to go that far\u2014the GOP plan does keep some aspects of the 2010 law. Mr. Heller may face a tough re-election challenge in 2018, and Mr. McConnell is known to work to shield those in his caucus from politically tough votes when possible.That may lead to some serious negotiating with Ms. Collins to get her to vote \u201cyes,\u201d but she has shown a willingness to stand against her party before. She was one of two GOP Senators to vote against the confirmation of       Betsy DeVos       as Education Secretary, forcing Mr. Pence to cast the first-ever tiebreaking vote to confirm a cabinet member.Q: What is the schedule?Mr. McConnell was expected to push for a vote last week, but the party ran into a procedural hurdle, as it appeared he lacked the Republican votes to proceed to debate the bill. Mr. McConnell delayed plans for a vote last week after Ms. Collins and others had signaled they would vote \u201cno\u201d on a \u201cmotion to proceed\u201d if the bill hit the Senate floor in its current form.Mr. McConnell had really wanted to wrap up this process before the July 4 break, but the real deadline seems to be before the August recess. Congress goes on recess for the month of August and during that time, many Republicans may face tough town hall meetings with constituents in their home states. The Republican effort to roll back Obamacare comes as the law, passed by Democrats in 2010, is seeing some of its best approval ratings from the public. GOP leaders fear political pressure over the recess\u2014as well as the fact that Republicans leaders will want to move on to other business such as a tax overhaul\u2014could doom the bill.Negotiations over the bill have been continuing during the July 4 recess, when lawmakers also are feeling pressure from constituents at events and town halls. Mr. McConnell will have to wait for the CBO to do another analysis of a revamped bill before a vote.\u00a0 That can take two weeks. So if a deal is reached soon enough, a vote is possible the week they return, or soon after.\u2014Kristina Peterson and Stephanie Armour contributed to this article.Write to Joshua Jamerson at joshua.jamerson@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-04 18:03:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/what-to-expect-as-health-law-debate-moves-forward-1499205815", "news_title": "What to Expect as Health-Law Debate Moves Forward", "keywords": "aca,health bill vote,obamacare,political,general news,society,community,health,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,lower house,upper house,welfare,social services,insurance,non-life insurance,medical insurance,financial services"}, {"content": "J.P. Morgan Chase        JPM 0.14%       & Co. made a preliminary approach to acquire U.K. payments business         Worldpay Group Inc.,       potentially marking one of the biggest deals for a U.S. bank since the financial crisis and reflecting banks\u2019 growing confidence in a shifting regulatory environment.The board of Worldpay on Tuesday said it had received separate preliminary approaches from J.P. Morgan and from             Vantiv Inc.,        VNTV 0.63%       a U.S.-based credit-card processor. The board said there is no certainty an offer will be made; the two parties have until Aug. 1\u2014a deadline set by U.K. takeover regulators\u2014to announce whether they intend to make an offer.The expression of interest by the biggest U.S. bank by assets comes just days after J.P. Morgan and peers were given a regulatory green light to return billions of dollars of capital to shareholders via increased dividends and share buybacks. That news bolstered U.S. bank stocks, which had risen sharply in the wake of       Donald Trump\u2019s       electoral victory last November.Like other big banks, J.P. Morgan has forgone sizable deals since the 2008 financial crisis when it agreed to buy Bear Stearns and             Washington Mutual                   in distressed sales. Bank executives and analysts said the postcrisis political and regulatory climate, which was hostile to banks believed to be \u201ctoo big to fail,\u201d made deal-making by the biggest firms virtually impossible.But the Trump administration said it would loosen the shackles on banks and is in the process of putting its nominees, some former bankers, into key oversight posts at the Federal Reserve and other regulatory agencies.\u201cWe\u2019ve seen with the recent stress-test results that the regulators have clearly indicated a more comfortable position with banks\u2019 returning and using excess capital right now,\u201d said Douglas Landy, a partner at law firm Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy LLP who focuses on financial-services regulation. \u201cAnd if you can just return it to your shareholders then why can\u2019t you use it for strategic acquisitions? In some ways that\u2019s a better way to use it: shore up your business model in a traditional space.\u201dMr. Landy said there also may be more regulatory leeway on this type of acquisition since it isn\u2019t a bank buying a bank or a consolidation of lending or other core banking functions. Instead, this is more targeted in a part of the industry that is undergoing a lot of change, especially through technology.J.P. Morgan\u2019s move shows the growing interest among big banks in harnessing technology\u2014whether by building it or buying it\u2014before it disrupts their businesses. In this, J.P. Morgan has been particularly active, creating Chase Pay, a person-to-person payments transfer system meant to rival that of             PayPal Holdings Inc.,       and launching a high-end rewards credit card that competes with the premier offering of             American Express Co.Worldpay processes millions of payments daily in stores, online and on cellphones, predominantly in the U.K. and the U.S. Its shares soared 28% Tuesday. As of Monday evening\u2014before the approaches were disclosed\u2014Worldpay had a market value of $8.2 billion.Formerly known as Fifth Third Processing Solutions, Symmes Township, Ohio-based Vantiv changed its name ahead of its 2012 initial public offering. Its technology helps merchants, banks and credit unions accept credit- and debit-card payments, as well as gift cards and online payments.The fall in the value of the pound versus the dollar following Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union last year made U.K.-based Worldpay a more attractive takeover target for U.S. buyers, bankers say. The company has been holding informal talks with potential suitors for months, according to people familiar with the matter.Payments businesses have recently been popular acquisition targets. Banks and payment companies are racing to retool their offerings as customers increasingly turn to mobile devices to pay for goods.Meanwhile, with processing fees being squeezed by regulators and the rising competition from technology startups, incumbents are trying to gain heft to generate economies of scale, analysts have said. Worldpay rival Nets AS of Denmark said last weekend that it had been approached by suitors. In April,             Mastercard Inc.got regulatory approval to acquire payment-technology firm VocaLink Holdings Ltd. for about $920 million.J.P. Morgan already runs Chase Paymentech Europe Ltd., a payments business based in Ireland which processes some 40 million credit and debit transactions a day.Like other banks, J.P. Morgan has been reshaping its business, predicting customers will move away from credit cards and simply pay with their phones. In 2015, J.P. Morgan announced an overhaul of its Chase Pay product to better compete with the likes of PayPal. The bank has joined with a number of U.S. merchants to push its payment app. While the bank has made a series of smaller financial technology acquisitions in recent years, it has so far held off from big-ticket deals.Worldpay was owned by Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC until 2010, when the bank was forced to sell the business following its taxpayer bailout. Worldpay was then bought by private-equity groups Advent International and Bain Capital, which listed it on the             London Stock Exchange                   in 2015.The business has been growing strongly, posting a 15% increase in revenue to \u00a34.54 billion ($5.88 billion) in 2016.Write to Max Colchester at max.colchester@wsj.com and Emily Glazer at emily.glazer@wsj.comAppeared in the July 5, 2017, print edition as 'Bank Bid Shows Shift in Oversight.'", "news_time": "2017-07-04 18:01:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/vantiv-j-p-morgan-make-takeover-approaches-for-u-k-s-worldpay-1499158209", "news_title": "J.P.

West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark, edged higher in abbreviated electronic trading, but there was no settlement price due to the holiday.Oil prices had gained about 11% in the previous eight sessions. That rally has been U.S. crude\u2019s longest run of gains since a 10-session streak that ended Jan. 6, 2010.Now investors are looking to this week\u2019s U.S. government report on oil output and stockpiles, which will be out Thursday instead of the usual Wednesday because of the holiday.Crude slid into bear market territory in June, falling more than 20% from this year\u2019s February highs amid worries that a rebound in U.S. output was offsetting supply cuts by OPEC and other exporters and would continue to weigh on the market. Three years after oil prices began their steep decline, many American shale drillers have adapted by focusing on their best acreage and making technological improvements that allow them to continue pumping even as the price stays relatively low.But U.S. producers may not have ramped up earlier this year as quickly as many in the industry thought, and they may now be slowing down. U.S. data late last week showed that production in April fell, contrary to the increase that preliminary weekly production figures had shown, and the number of rigs drilling for crude fell for the first time since January.Even though the decline was a small one\u2014the rig count ticked down by just two last week\u2014some see the drop as a sign that shale producers wouldn\u2019t be able to keep up the relentless pace of drilling at prices below $45 a barrel. On Monday, U.S. crude rose to $47.07.\u201cIf prices stay low, we\u2019re going to see capex cuts. We\u2019re going to start dropping rigs,\u201d said       Rob Thummel,        managing director for Tortoise Capital Advisors.The evidence that shale producers are slowing remains modest and preliminary. Much of the production decline in April came from the Gulf of Mexico, where maintenance work weighed on output.Also, investors have seen oil prices rise before on the belief that U.S. production was falling. Those higher prices then motivated the shale industry to step up production again, keeping crude within a range.After prices fell to decade lows early last year, U.S. drillers idled rigs and output hit a low of under 8.5 million barrels a day by the summer. That, coupled with the OPEC cuts later in the year, pushed the price back up. But as prices rose, American producers ramped up again, increasing their production to above 9 million barrels a day by February this year, and putting pressure on the market once more.Further complicating the efforts to drain the glut, oil may be flowing faster in other parts of the world. Analysts at consultancy JBC Energy estimate that OPEC\u2019s crude production rose by 210,000 barrels a day in June. More than half of the increase was due to the startup of several fields in Libya, which is an OPEC member but exempt from their output deal. Tepid demand growth is also undermining analysts\u2019 belief that the price rises will sustain through this year.And some say the recent rally has been more technically driven than less of a sign of a tectonic shift. Trading was light ahead of the holiday Tuesday in the U.S. Some analysts said the rally was likely driven more by investors closing out bets on falling prices than by new bets on rising prices.Going forward, \u201cthe market will be looking at the relationship between prices and rig counts and ultimately production,\u201d said       Tom Pugh,        a commodities analyst at Capital Economics. \u201cEverybody is watching what happens in the U.S.\u201dWrite to Alison Sider at alison.sider@wsj.com and Georgi Kantchev at georgi.kantchev@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-04 17:41:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/oil-edges-down-in-low-volume-holiday-trading-1499165040", "news_title": "Oil\u2019s Rally Pauses in Holiday Trading   ", "keywords": "brent,crude oil,nymex,oil prices,OPEC,commodity markets,energy markets,commodity,financial market news,energy,natural gas upstream operations,crude petroleum extraction,natural gas,oil extraction"}, {"content": "Prosecutors are expected to present opening arguments to jurors in the case against New York City Councilman       Ruben Wills       on Wednesday, three years after the Queens politician was indicted on charges of stealing tens of thousands of dollars in campaign and taxpayer money.Mr. Wills, a Democrat representing a district in southern Queens, is facing criminal charges that he and a relative who worked for him took about $30,000 in matching campaign funds and state grant money intended for a charity he controlled and used it for personal expenses, including a $750 Louis Vuitton handbag bought at             Macy\u2019s,       according to state Attorney General       Eric Schneiderman\u2019s       office.\u201cElected office doesn\u2019t give anyone license to break the law, or avoid the consequences,\u201d said       Amy Spitalnick,        a spokeswoman for Mr. Schneiderman.\u201cWith trust in government falling, it\u2019s all the more vital to send a clear message: Public corruption will not be tolerated in New York,\u201d she said.Bad record-keeping doesn\u2019t amount to criminal behavior, said Mr. Wills\u2019 lawyer       Kevin O\u2019Donnell.       None of the money the state accuses Mr. Wills of stealing was spent on personal items, Mr. O\u2019Donnell said.\u201cThe fact that an accountant or auditor can\u2019t link up receipts to specific designated money spent by Ruben doesn\u2019t make it criminal,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Donnell added.Prosecutors, however, allege Mr. Wills defrauded the New York City Campaign Finance Board and the New York State Office of Children and Family services.Mr. Wills funneled $11,500 from funds that included campaign matching money to pay a shell company called Micro Targeting for the translation and distribution of campaign literature in 2009, prosecutors contend. The company never provided those services, they said.Mr. Wills had a relative       Jelani Mills       redirect the money to NY 4 Life, a nonprofit organization Mr. Wills controlled, prosecutors said. Instead of making legitimate campaign expenditures, Mr. Wills allegedly withdrew money and spent it on himself, they said.Prosecutors also claim Mr. Wills misused about $19,000 in grant money from the state Office of Children and Family services intended for several NY 4 Life public-service projects.Mr. Wills used the money for political and personal expenses and issued checks to individuals who did little or no work related to the program, prosecutors said.Mr. Wills attorney maintains that the money was spent on the designated programs in an appropriate manner.If convicted, Mr. Wills would face up to 7 years in prison.Last year, Mr. Mills pleaded guilty to falsifying business records in the second degree and was sentenced to a year probation and 10 days of community service.Neither Mr. Mills nor his attorney could be reached for comment.", "news_time": "2017-07-04 17:12:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/opening-arguments-set-for-queens-councilmans-trial-1499202752", "news_title": "Opening Arguments Set for Queens Councilman\u2019s Trial", "keywords": "nyc crime,ny fraud,public corruption,Ruben Wills,political,general news,charities,philanthropy,society,community,crime,legal action,politics,international relations,domestic politics,burglary,theft"}, {"content": "Republican senators are confronting a political challenge that is increasingly hard to ignore as they engage with voters during the July Fourth recess: Under their health-care overhaul, average premiums for a midlevel insurance plan would jump by 20% next January.That means many people who don\u2019t get insurance through work would see their premiums increase just a few months before the midterm elections, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Premiums would fall in later years, in part because less-comprehensive plans would be offered by that time.This highlights what some Republicans privately concede is a Catch-22 as GOP Senate leaders work to assemble a bill they can bring to the floor when Congress returns to Washington: Both passing a bill and not passing one carry political peril.Yet Republicans\u2019 plight does resemble that of the Democrats seven years ago in many ways. Democrats were similarly caught between passing an unpopular bill not long before a new president\u2019s first midterm elections, or failing to honor a longtime promise after seizing control of Congress and the White House.\u201cDemocrats were a lot smarter because they didn\u2019t have anything take effect until after the election,\u201d said Rep. Mark Amodei (R., Nev.), referring to the provisions of the 2010 Affordable Care Act.\u201cTasked with honoring a promise seven years in the making, Republican leaders have instead put their caucus in a very big bind going into the midterm elections,\u201d said David Bozell, president of ForAmerica, a grassroots-oriented conservative group that opposes the Senate bill.Many Democrats view passage of the ACA as a historic achievement, but they also suffered a political cataclysm in the 2010 midterms from which they arguably still haven\u2019t recovered.The fate of Republican health-care efforts now may hinge on whether GOP leaders can persuade enough Republican senators that forging ahead is their best political bet. Like Democratic leaders in 2010, Republican leaders today are telling their members it is better to pass an imperfect, unpopular bill than to renege on such a big pledge.The near-term premium increase only raises the stakes of that bet. In Blanco, Texas, for example, a 40-year-old would see premiums go up by $494 in January under the Senate bill, according to an analysis of CBO data by the Century Foundation. In Nome, Alaska, premiums would rise by $2,376.Bigger impacts would hit in later years, when average premiums fall for plans that offer fewer benefits than required under the ACA, but spending cuts to Medicaid spending would accelerate, raising costs for many Americans, according to the CBO.The political Catch-22 has made it harder for Republicans to unify around a single bill. GOP senators have split, with centrists saying the legislation guts too much of the current health law and conservatives pushing to abandon the bill altogether because they say it doesn\u2019t do enough to repeal the ACA.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) is trying to salvage the plan, which in its broad outlines would dismantle much of the ACA and set up a new system that would provide smaller tax credits, deep cuts to Medicaid, and funding to stabilize markets.Mr. McConnell scrapped plans to hold a vote last week after Republican centrists such as Susan Collins of Maine said they couldn\u2019t support the measure because it would leave too many people uninsured. Conservatives are also balking at the bill, and President       Donald Trump       on Friday tweeted that senators should repeal the ACA first and replace it later on.Given these divisions, it is unclear whether Mr. McConnell can put together a revised bill and bring it to a vote after Congress returns next week. The reception senators are getting back home this week, and the success of private negotiations, will help determine the bill\u2019s fate.The CBO\u2019s findings haven\u2019t made Mr. McConnell\u2019s job easier. Among other things, the CBO found that roughly 15 million fewer people would be insured under the Senate bill than the ACA in 2018, though many of those would have dropped insurance because they would no longer be required to have it. By 2026, the difference in the number of uninsured compared with the ACA would rise to 22 million.The rise in premiums could give a boost to Democrats, who are otherwise playing defense on the 2018 Senate electoral battleground, with several vulnerable Democrats facing re-election in conservative states. Democrats need to retake three seats in the Senate and 24 in the House to seize control of those chambers.Republicans say the ACA, often called Obamacare, is in a state of collapse and continues to harm consumers. Voters will remember that it was pushed through in a partisan way, they say.\u201cIf Senate Democrats really wanted to fix our broken health-care system, they would drop their petty partisan games and offer actual solutions to the devastation that Obamacare has caused to our health-care system,\u201d Katie Martin, spokeswoman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said recently.Sen. Brian Schatz (D., Hawaii) said Republicans\u2019 efforts to blame Democrats won\u2019t stick \u201cbecause they\u2019re the ruling party right now, and they\u2019ve taken responsibility for health care.\u201d He added, \u201cThey have cobbled together such an ugly piece of legislation that they now have bad choices and worse choices.\u201dKey to the premium increases is the repeal of an ACA provision much reviled by the GOP\u2014the penalty on people who don\u2019t have health insurance. Ending that individual mandate would mean many healthier people would drop their insurance, leaving insurers with older and sicker people whose costs drive up premiums.But the negotiations have proven rocky. Some conservative Republicans say the Senate bill fails to lower premiums enough for those who retain insurance. To address that, Sen. Ted Cruz (R., Texas) is championing an amendment saying insurers who offer at least one plan that meets ACA requirements could also offer a cheaper plan covering fewer benefits.A number of conservative groups, including FreedomWorks, Tea Party Patriots and Club for Growth, say that wouldn\u2019t go far enough in scrapping the ACA.Republican centrists, on the other hand, are insisting that many of the ACA\u2019s requirements stay in place, concerned that to strike them would remove important patient protections.Write to Stephanie Armour at stephanie.armour@wsj.com and Kristina Peterson at kristina.peterson@wsj.comAppeared in the July 5, 2017, print edition as 'Higher Health Costs Challenge GOP.'", "news_time": "2017-07-04 16:33:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/senators-come-up-against-little-noticed-impact-of-gop-health-bill-1499166002", "news_title": "GOP Senators Weigh Higher Health Premiums\u2019 Possible Effect on Midterms ", "keywords": " affordable care act, donald trump,health bill, health care reform, higher premiums, republicans, senate health plan,Congressional Budget Office,David Bozell,Mark Amodei,Mitch McConnell,Susan Collins,Donald Trump,political,general news,health,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,legislative branch,lower house,elections,national,presidential elections,upper house,insurance,non-life insurance,medical insurance,financial services"}, {"content": "Illinois\u2019s Republican governor vetoed a budget plan that gained final approval from the Democratic General Assembly earlier Tuesday. But less than an hour later, the state Senate overrode his vetoes of the three bills in the package.The budget now heads back to the House for an override vote as early as Wednesday. If that chamber successfully overrides Gov. Bruce Rauner\u2019s veto, the legislature will have enacted the state\u2019s first budget in more than two years.No other U.S. state has gone without a budget for more than a year since the Great Depression.\u201cThe package of legislation fails to address Illinois\u2019s fiscal and economic crisis\u2014and in fact, makes it worse in the long run,\u201d Mr. Rauner said in his veto message to the legislature. \u201cBudgets in Illinois won\u2019t be balanced or stay balanced unless our economy grows faster than our government spending. We have been ignoring that truth for 35 years.\u201dThe state\u2019s impasse is the result of a political standoff between Mr. Rauner, elected in November 2014, and longtime House Speaker       Michael Madigan,        a Chicago Democrat.Mr. Rauner takes issue with the revenue side of the legislature\u2019s proposal, which levies a roughly $5 billion permanent income tax increase to fund the more than $36 billion spending bill. The state brings in roughly $32 billion a year.The governor has said he would prefer the income-tax increase be temporary, and is seeking other concessions from Democratic lawmakers, including a property tax freeze and a revamp of the state\u2019s worker compensation system.At the moment, it appears the House has the votes necessary to override the governor\u2019s vetoes.The tax increase, the most contentious part of the budget, earned 72 votes when it passed the House on Sunday, surpassing the three-fifths-majority threshold of 71 votes required to override a gubernatorial veto. Fifteen House Republicans voted for the tax increase. The Senate overrode the governor\u2019s veto of the revenue measure with the minimum number of required votes Tuesday.Democratic Rep. Greg Harris, Mr. Madigan\u2019s top lieutenant in budget negotiations, wrote the revenue and spending measures that cleared the House this weekend.The Senate passed both measures Tuesday, and gave final legislative approval to a budget implementation bill that would allow Illinois to borrow billions of dollars through the sale of state bonds. Those funds would go toward paying down the state\u2019s $14.6 billion in unpaid bills.The revenue bill increases the state\u2019s personal income-tax rate from 3.75% to 4.95% and the corporate income-tax rate from 5.25% to 7%. The spending bill includes a 5% cut to government agencies and reduces state higher education funding by 10%.\u201cWe are faced today with the fierce urgency of now. We don\u2019t have any more time. And too late is not good enough,\u201d said Democratic Sen. Toi Hutchinson, who presented the revenue measure to the Senate. \u201cIt is time to be the independent legislature that our framers demanded.\u201dBut Republican Senate Minority Leader Bill Brady said he couldn\u2019t vote for the tax increase without legislation to enact the governor\u2019s demands.\u201cIt\u2019s regrettable that I stand today not capable of supporting this package, not necessarily because what\u2019s in the package is bad, but because it\u2019s incomplete,\u201d Mr. Brady said. \u201cWe need a comprehensive solution for this state.\u201dMs. Hutchinson affirmed Democrats would remain at the negotiating table to keep working on property tax relief and workers\u2019 compensation overhauls, \u201cbut those things aren\u2019t at stake today. Our colleges and universities are at stake today. Our child care centers. Our mental health institutions,\u201d she said.Talks on nonbudget issues, including the governor\u2019s priorities, have deteriorated since the House revenue and spending votes Sunday. Mr. Brady and Republican House Minority Leader Jim Durkin failed to appear at legislative leaders\u2019 meetings Monday and Tuesday with Mr. Madigan and Democratic Senate President John Cullerton.Following the Senate\u2019s approval of the budget plan, Mr. Madigan confirmed he wouldn\u2019t call a vote in the House on Tuesday to override the governor\u2019s veto if Mr. Rauner rejected the budget later that day.Corrections & Amplifications   Illinois\u2019s Democratic General Assembly granted final passage Tuesday to state revenue and spending measures.

European leaders have signaled they are prepared to confront Mr. Trump over an \u201cAmerica first\u201d doctrine they see as harmful to both free trade and the environment.\u201cThis will be a very tough summit for him,\u201d said       Angela Stent,        a government professor at Georgetown University.Previewing the clashing agendas, German Chancellor       Angela Merkel       seemed to take a swipe at Mr. Trump last week over his withdrawal from the Paris climate accord, telling parliament, \u201cWe cannot and will not wait until every last person in the world has been successfully convinced of the scientific findings about climate change.\u201dThe French, meantime, are worried that Mr. Trump might take new steps that inhibit free-flowing trade and say Europe is preparing to consider retaliatory measures should he impose tariffs on U.S. steel imports, an issue the administration is now studying.An adviser to French President       Emmanuel Macron       said, \u201cIf the measures impact European exports, we would of course be led to react very quickly and we are preparing for that.\u201dAfter arriving in Germany, Mr. Trump will meet with no fewer than nine foreign counterparts, White House officials said.An issue that has taken on increasing urgency is North Korea\u2019s nuclear ambitions.On the eve of Independence Day in the U.S., North Korea test-fired what it claimed to be an intercontinental ballistic missile, stepping up its effort to develop a nuclear weapon system that could target the U.S.Mr. Trump tweeted after the launch: \u201cPerhaps China will put a heavy move on North Korea and end this nonsense once and for all!\u201dMr. Trump will hold meetings with a pair of allies threatened by Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear program: Prime Minister       Shinzo Abe       of Japan and South Korean President Moon Jae-in. He also will meet with Chinese President       Xi Jinping,        whom Mr. Trump is beseeching to take more forceful gestures to rein in North Korea\u2019s weapons program.As North Korea\u2019s largest trade partner, China has economic clout that it can use to pressure the North Korean regime, administration officials say.Speaking to reporters in advance of the trip,       H.R. McMaster,        Mr. Trump\u2019s national security adviser, said that China has \u201ctremendous coercive power in connection with the economic relationship and the trade relationships with North Korea. So, China acknowledged that there is a lot that they can do in connection with convincing the North Korean regime that it\u2019s in their interest to denuclearize.\u201dNone of Mr. Trump\u2019s meetings is likely to command as much attention as his sit-down with Mr. Putin.As a candidate, Mr. Trump heaped praise on Mr. Putin and vowed that the two would forge a better rapport than was the case under former President       Barack Obama.Since his election, though, the president and top officials have acknowledged that relations between the two countries remained sour.\u201cWe may be at an all-time low in terms of relationship with Russia,\u201d the president said at a news conference in April.Part of the reason for Mr. Trump\u2019s visit to Warsaw, meantime, is to show solidarity with Eastern Europe allies living in Russia\u2019s shadow, a senior administration official said. During the visit, Mr. Trump will give a speech at Krasinski Square, site of an uprising against Nazi occupying forces during World War II. The president will also hold a joint news conference with his Polish counterpart,       Andrzej Duda.\u201cIt\u2019s a bit of message to Russia that we\u2019re going to stand with countries on NATO\u2019s eastern flank that are most directly pressured by Russia,\u201d the official said.A backdrop to the Trump-Putin meeting is an intensifying U.S. investigation into Russia\u2019s role in the 2016 presidential race. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is probing whether Trump campaign aides colluded with Russia to help him defeat Democrat       Hillary Clinton.U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded Russia hacked computer systems and stole private emails to damage Mrs. Clinton\u2019s candidacy and elect Mr. Trump. Russia has denied the charge, while Mr. Trump has said he believes Russia was \u201cprobably\u201d behind the cyberattacks.Russian officials believe the investigations handcuff Mr. Trump when it comes to foreign policy.\u201cThere are very serious and influential circles who still cannot reconcile themselves to the victory of Donald Trump in the elections and use the question of relations with Moscow for domestic politics,\u201d said Russian Deputy Foreign Minister       Sergei Ryabkov       in an interview published Monday. \u201cThey are trying to limit the administration\u2019s abilities to maneuver.\u201dIt is unclear whether Mr. Trump will confront Mr. Putin about Russian meddling in the election. Intelligence officials have warned that Russia is prepared to mount more covert efforts to undermine American elections.Seldom one to stick to the script, Mr. Trump will come into the meeting with Mr. Putin with \u201cno specific agenda,\u201d Mr. McMaster told reporters. \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s really going to be whatever the president wants to talk about.\u201dBut members of Congress want to see the president raise the issue with Mr. Putin.\u201cThe only way that we defend our next election is by making them pay a price for their interference in our last election,\u201d said Sen.       Chris Coons       (D., Del.), a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.White House officials said they expect the two leaders will discuss the civil war in Syria and the conflict in Ukraine. They discouraged hopes of a major breakthrough.\u201cPart of this meeting will be just to see if we can talk more and argue less and ratchet down the tensions,\u201d the administration official said.A top Russian official said this week that Mr. Putin is expected to raise the issue of fighting terrorism, but tempered expectations of a rapid rapprochement, Russian news agencies reported.Kremlin aide       Yury Ushakov       said Monday it would be \u201clogical to discuss\u201d the crises in Syria and Ukraine, but added: \u201cWe believe that in general the problem of international terrorism needs to be discussed between the two leaders of the world powers as a top priority,\u201d Russian news agencies reported.The U.S. and Russia have consistently been at odds over Syria and Ukraine policy, and Russia has been under American and European sanctions after Moscow\u2019s annexation of the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014.Mr. Putin has cast himself as a bulwark against Islamic militancy with his intervention in Syria, where U.S. officials say he has focused efforts largely on propping up the regime of Syrian President       Bashar al-Assad.\u2014Anton Troianovski and William Horobin contributed to this article.Write to Peter Nicholas at peter.nicholas@wsj.com and Nathan Hodge at nathan.hodge@wsj.comAppeared in the July 5, 2017, print edition as 'Putin Meeting Tops Trump\u2019s Trip Agenda.'", "news_time": "2017-07-04 16:13:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-to-face-putin-discuss-north-korean-threat-during-europe-trip-1499199190", "news_title": "Trump to Face Putin, Discuss North Korean Threat During Europe Trip ", "keywords": "europe,foreign relations,g-20,group of 20,north korea,putin,russia,trump,Group of 20,Donald Trump,Vladimir Putin,political,general news,international relations,politics,domestic politics,elections,national,presidential elections"}, {"content": "Budget showdowns cast a pall over the holiday weekend in Connecticut, Illinois and New Jersey, and it couldn\u2019t happen to a nicer group of politicians. While all dysfunctional governments are dysfunctional in their own way, the three blue states are hitting the same progressive dead end.In Illinois, Democrats spent the long weekend coaxing Republican legislators to join their suicide pact to raise taxes to plug a $6 billion deficit and pay down a $15 billion backlog of bills. And don\u2019t forget the $130 billion unfunded pension liability\u2014none of which will be solved by the $5 billion tax hike. GOP Governor       Bruce Rauner       vetoed the bill on Tuesday but may be overridden.After credit-rating agencies threatened to downgrade the state debt to junk, Mr. Rauner proposed raising the state\u2019s income tax to 4.95% from 3.75% and the corporate income rate to 9.5% from 7.75% for four years. In return he asked for a property tax freeze and modest reforms to workers compensation. Yet Mr. Rauner already signed off on a huge property tax hike in Chicago\u2014homeowner bills have increased by a quarter in two years\u2014to pay for teacher pensions.The state legislature is controlled by public unions that refuse to compromise. But the budget crisis became more urgent after a federal judge on Friday ordered the state to make long overdue Medicaid payments, which had been subordinated to pensions and worker pay. While states can\u2019t go bankrupt, Illinois is showing they can default\u2014and that they will prioritize public workers over other creditors.Pensions will consume about a quarter of Illinois\u2019s general fund this year. Nearly 40% of state education dollars go toward teacher pensions, and the state paid nearly as much into the State Universities Retirement System last year as it spent on higher education.Anemic revenue and economic growth can\u2019t keep up with entitlement spending. The state\u2019s GDP has ticked up by a mere 0.8% annually over the last four years compared to 2% nationwide and 1.4% in the Great Lakes region. Since 2010 more than 520,000 Illinois residents on net have fled to other states. (See the nearby chart for some state comparisons.)Democrats held veto-proof super majorities in the legislature during Mr. Rauner\u2019s first two years. But House Speaker       Michael Madigan       wants to force the Governor to repudiate his campaign promise not to raise taxes and make Republicans share political responsibility for the state\u2019s economic failures. Amid deteriorating public services, Mr. Madigan persuaded 15 House Republicans to back Mr. Rauner\u2019s tax hike a la carte, which spared 11 Democrats in conservative districts from having to take a tough vote. The state Senate followed Monday.If Republicans override Mr. Rauner\u2019s veto without insisting on substantive reforms, they\u2019ll repeat the mistake of Connecticut\u2019s former Republican Governor       Jodi Rell       who in 2009 raised the state\u2019s top rate to 6.5% from 5% while doing little to rationalize spending or fix the state\u2019s bankrupt political culture. See how well that turned out.Democrats have since raised the Nutmeg State\u2019s top rate to 6.99%. Revenue and economic growth have slumped as high-earning residents have decamped for lower-tax climes. Hedge-fund managers are struggling to sell their palaces in Greenwich. The legislature\u2019s Office of Fiscal Analysis downgraded income-tax revenues this year by $1.1 billion, and sales and corporate taxes are projected to fall by $450 million.Meanwhile, pension contributions have doubled since 2010 and along with retiree health care\u2014most pay no deductible and a maximum $15 co-pay\u2014make up 20% of the budget. Democratic Gov.       Dannel Malloy       has ordered cuts to local aid while legislators debate how to close a $5.1 billion budget gap.Mr. Malloy       wants to shift some of the teacher pension costs to cities, but Democratic legislators howl that this will further drive up the state\u2019s astronomical property taxes. The tax bill on a $300,000 home in Hartford is $22,287. Many Democrats would prefer to raise sales taxes, which shows that liberals will eventually come after everyone else after they tap out the wealthy.For another example, see New Jersey where lame duck Republican Gov.       Chris Christie       has raided the not-for-profit health insurer Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield to finance rising state health-care costs. State residents were taken hostage this weekend when Mr. Christie ordered a shutdown of state beaches and parks until Democrats passed a budget that requires Horizon to spend some $300 million in \u201cexcess\u201d reserves on expanded opioid treatment, among other public health services.Democratic Assembly Speaker       Vincent Prieto       resisted this tax on Horizon policy holders if only because they include state workers but then compromised with Mr. Christie to return \u201csurplus\u201d funds to enrollees. But the shakedown is a warning to Garden State taxpayers. Pension payments have doubled over the past two years and will triple over the next five. To pay the state\u2019s bills, Democratic gubernatorial candidate       Phil Murphy       has promised to soak the rich\u2014then rinse and repeat. The state\u2019s top income-tax rate is already 8.97% and the Tax Foundation says its property taxes are the highest in the land.Amid these blue state meltdowns, Maine\u2019s GOP Gov.       Paul LePage       suspended non-emergency government functions to impel his legislature to drop a lodging tax hike and roll back a voter initiative backed by the teachers union that increased the state\u2019s income tax this year by three percentage points to 10.15%, the highest in the Northeast. Temporarily closing the DMV was a small price to pay for preventing the kind of fiscal collapses that are occurring in Illinois, Connecticut and New Jersey.To adapt       Margaret Thatcher,        the problem with progressive governance is you eventually run out of other people\u2019s money.Appeared in the July 5, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-07-04 15:57:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/blue-state-budget-breakdowns-1499198223", "news_title": "Blue State Budget Breakdowns", "keywords": "economic performance,indicators,budget account,government finance,government budget,taxation,direct taxation,sub-national,local budget,economic news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,editorials"}, {"content": "Of the many abolitionists who criticized Abraham Lincoln during the Civil War, few were more vociferous than the celebrated Boston orator       Wendell Phillips,        who called Lincoln \u201cthe Slave-Hound of Illinois.\u201d Lincoln, Phillips charged, had \u201cno desire, no purpose, no thought, to lift the freed negro to a higher status, social or political, than that of a mere labourer, superintended by others.\u201d The president deserved some credit for issuing the Emancipation Proclamation, Phillips conceded, but that document merely provided \u201ctechnical liberty\u201d for slaves in certain states. Phillips insisted that Lincoln should have championed civil and political rights for blacks. \u201cEquality is our claim,\u201d he declared.You will find a similar sentiment expressed, at book length, in Fred Kaplan\u2019s \u201cLincoln and the Abolitionists:       John Quincy Adams,        Slavery, and the Civil War.\u201d A professor emeritus of English at Queens College, Mr. Kaplan sides with Phillips, deeming Lincoln a squishy \u201canti-abolition moderate Whig\u201d who talked a good game but took no significant action unless compelled to do so by circumstances beyond his control. Time and again Mr. Kaplan, who thinks that 21st-century Americans are too \u201cstarry-eyed about Lincoln,\u201d deplores the president\u2019s failure to publicly support black citizenship rights until the last week of his life.By Fred Kaplan  Harper, 395 pages, $28.99In making his case, the author demonstrates an infirm grasp of history, garbling the Dred Scott decision (it did not state that \u201cslave owners were entitled to take their property anyplace in the country they pleased\u201d), garbling the Emancipation Proclamation (in the preliminary version, Lincoln did not threaten to \u201cencourage\u201d slave rebellion), garbling habeas corpus (in the early months of the war, Lincoln suspended the writ far beyond \u201cthe sensitive Baltimore-Washington area\u201d). Elementary mistakes abound: Tennessee actually did secede; Bull Run and Manassas were the same battle; the Compromise of 1850 did not abrogate the Missouri Compromise of 1820; Lincoln did not choose his own running mate in 1864 (or in 1860, for that matter).Reviewing Lincoln\u2019s prewar record on slavery, Mr. Kaplan often compares him unfavorably with John Quincy Adams, the subject of the author\u2019s previous book. Adams, born and raised in Massachusetts, championed the antislavery crusade most fervently during his long post-presidential career as a congressman. Adams did not face the same political realities that Lincoln faced as he spearheaded that cause in Illinois and that he faced as a president striving to save the union.In fact, far from being a reluctant emancipator, Lincoln hated and loathed and despised slavery from the time he was young. In 1864, he wrote: \u201cI am naturally anti-slavery. If slavery is not wrong, nothing is wrong. I can not remember when I did not so think, and feel.\u201d Six years earlier, he had said: \u201cI have always hated slavery, I think, as much as any abolitionist.\u201d He concluded that speech with a heartfelt appeal: \u201cLet us discard all this quibbling about this man and the other man: this race and that race and the other race being inferior, and therefore they must be placed in an inferior position. . . . Let us discard all these things, and unite as one people throughout this land, until we shall once more stand up declaring that all men are created equal.\u201d Abundant evidence supports these statements, none of which Mr. Kaplan cites.The author provides valuable information about John Quincy Adams as an antislavery paladin, but his treatment of Lincoln constitutes a superficial, misleading and often inaccurate caricature. Readers interested in the topic of Lincoln and the abolitionists should consult the work of       James Oakes,        especially \u201cThe Radical and the Republican:       Frederick Douglass,       Abraham Lincoln,        and the Triumph of Antislavery Politics\u201d (2007). And they should look to the opinions of the abolitionists themselves.Early in the war, several of his antislavery confr\u00e8res shared Phillips\u2019s view, but as time went by they changed their minds.       William Lloyd Garrison,        the chief spokesman for abolition, had been a fierce detractor of Lincoln. But he mellowed, insisting toward the war\u2019s end that the president should be judged on the basis of \u201chis possibilities, rather than by our wishes, or by the highest abstract moral standard.\u201d Garrison expressed his \u201cfirm conviction\u201d that \u201cno man has occupied the chair of the Chief Magistracy in America, who has more assiduously or more honestly endeavored to discharge all its duties with a single eye to the welfare of the country, than Mr. Lincoln.\u201dTo an Englishman who denounced Lincoln as a hopeless bigot who had supposedly \u201csworn to support slavery for the rebels,\u201d Garrison in 1864 acknowledged that the president might have gone further. But it was possible that Lincoln \u201ccould not have gone one hair\u2019s breadth beyond the point he has reached by a slow and painful process, without inciting civil war at the North, and overturning the government.\u201d Such speculation, Garrison noted, was \u201cidle.\u201d Instead, he cited what could definitely be known: Lincoln\u2019s \u201cEmancipation proclamation . . . liberated more than three-fourths of the entire slave population.\u201dAs the election of 1864 drew near, most abolitionists sided with Garrison rather than Phillips, who supported       John C. Fr\u00e9mont       for president. The following year, after Lincoln\u2019s assassination, Frederick Douglass hailed Lincoln as \u201cemphatically the black man\u2019s President: the first to show any respect for their rights as men. . . . He was the first American President who . . . rose above the prejudice of his times, and country.\u201d If during the early stages of the war the president had favored colonizing African-Americans abroad, Douglass asserted, \u201cLincoln soon outgrew his colonization ideas and schemes and came to look upon the Black man as an American citizen.\u201d You will not find either of these statements by Garrison and Douglass in Fred Kaplan\u2019s book.Mr. Burlingame is a professor of history at the University of Illinois, Springfield.", "news_time": "2017-07-04 15:52:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/lincolns-road-to-emancipation-1499197971", "news_title": "Lincoln\u2019s Road to Emancipation", "keywords": "book review,books,political,general news,society,community,arts,entertainment,human rights,civil liberties,politics,international relations,reviews"}, {"content": "One message of President       Trump\u2019s       is popular at home with his political base and embraced abroad by key Middle Eastern allies: The Islamic Republic of Iran is imperialist, repressive, and\u2014unless we adopt a new strategy\u2014on its way toward possessing nuclear weapons. To keep the threat at bay, Mr. Trump should take a page from the playbook       Ronald Reagan       used against the Soviet Union.In the early 1980s, President Reagan shifted away from his predecessors\u2019 containment strategy toward a new plan of rolling back Soviet expansionism. The cornerstone of his strategy was the recognition that the Soviet Union was an aggressive and revolutionary yet internally fragile regime that had to be defeated.Reagan\u2019s policy was outlined in 1983 in National Security Decision Directive 75, a comprehensive strategy that called for the use of all instruments of American overt and covert power. The plan included a massive defense buildup, economic warfare, support for anti-Soviet proxy forces and dissidents, and an all-out offensive against the regime\u2019s ideological legitimacy.Mr. Trump should call for a new version of NSDD-75 and go on offense against the Iranian regime. The administration would be wise to address every aspect of the Iranian menace, not merely the nuclear program. President       Obama\u2019s       myopic focus on disarmament paralyzed American policy.Under Mr. Obama\u2019s deeply flawed nuclear accord, Tehran does not need to cheat to reach threshold nuclear-weapons capabilities. Merely by waiting for key constraints to sunset, the regime can emerge over the next decade with an industrial-size enrichment program, a near-zero breakout time, an easier clandestine path to a nuclear warhead, long-range ballistic missiles, access to advanced conventional weaponry, greater regional dominance, and a more powerful economy, increasingly immunized against Western sanctions. You could call this scenario the lethal Iranian end-state.A new national security directive must systemically dismantle Iranian power country by country in the Middle East. The Europeans, traumatized by foreign fighters returning from Syria and massive refugee flows, may support a tougher Iran policy if it means Washington finally gets serious about Syria. The early signs of the return of American power are promising: 59 Tomahawk missiles launched in response to the Assad regime\u2019s most recent chemical attack, military strikes at Iran-backed militias in southern Syria, the downing of a Syrian fighter plane and Iranian-made drones, and 281 Syria-related sanctions in five months.Washington should demolish the Iranian regime\u2019s terrorist networks and influence operations, including their presence in Europe and the United States. That means working closely with allied Sunni governments against Iranian subversion of their societies. The American offensive has already begun: CIA Director       Mike Pompeo       is putting the agency on an aggressive footing against these global networks with the development of a more muscular covert action program.All of Washington\u2019s actions to push back against Tehran hinge on severely weakening the Iranian regime\u2019s finances. Robust measures should target the regime\u2019s praetorians, the Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps, a dominant force in Iran\u2019s economy. New sanctions legislation designating the IRGC for terrorism\u2014which the Senate recently passed with 98 votes\u2014and the more than 40 Iran-related sanctions imposed this year are a good start. But much more is still needed: The IRGC\u2019s transfer to Hezbollah of industrial-size missile production capability based on Lebanon soil could trigger the next Israel-Hezbollah war. Massive economic sanctions on Iran to stop these transfers may be the only way to head off this war.Last but not least, the American pressure campaign should seek to undermine Iran\u2019s rulers by strengthening the pro-democracy forces that erupted in Iran in 2009, nearly toppling the regime. Target the regime\u2019s soft underbelly: its massive corruption and human-rights abuses. Conventional wisdom assumes that Iran has a stable government with a public united behind President       Hassan Rouhani\u2019s       vision of incremental reform. In reality, the gap between the ruled and their Islamist rulers is expanding.The odds that a moderate government will emerge in Tehran before the nuclear deal\u2019s restrictions expire are poor. Washington needs to block the Islamic Republic\u2019s pathways to gaining nuclear-tipped missiles. While aggressively enforcing the nuclear agreement, the administration should present revised terms for a follow-on deal. These must address the current accord\u2019s fundamental flaws, including the sunset provisions that give Tehran a clear pathway to nuclear weapons and the missiles to deliver them, and the inadequate access to Iranian military sites that blocks effective verification.The administration should present Iran the choice between a new agreement and an unrelenting American pressure campaign while signaling that it is unilaterally prepared to cancel the existing deal if Tehran doesn\u2019t play ball.Only six years after Ronald Reagan adopted his pressure strategy, the Soviet bloc collapsed. Washington must intensify the pressure on the mullahs as Reagan did on the communists. Otherwise, a lethal nuclear Iran is less than a decade away.Mr. Dubowitz is chief executive of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.", "news_time": "2017-07-04 15:51:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/confront-iran-the-reagan-way-1499197879", "news_title": "Confront Iran the Reagan Way", "keywords": "fdd,iran deal,nuclear deal,nuclear weapons,tehran,Ronald Reagan,political,general news,national,public security,armed forces,nuclear weapons programs,politics,international relations,domestic politics,weapons programs,commentaries,opinions,aerospace,defense,industrial goods"}, {"content": "Brent Budowsky        writing at TheHill.com, June\u00a029:Watching the latest vulgar and sexist outburst of       Donald Trump,        who temporarily occupies the Oval Office and has now turned his foul mouth against       Mika Brzezinski,        let me suggest an idea that is offered very seriously.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.Joe Scarborough,        who is a serious and principled conservative even if he makes too many snide comments about liberals from the upper East Side and Georgetown, should enter the GOP primaries and run against Trump in the 2020 presidential campaigns.While the thought of former president Trump someday glued to the television watching CNN and MSNBC and then writing angry vulgar tweets about future president Joe Scarborough and his first lady Mika has its own appeal, the idea of a principled conservative replacing by succeeding an unprincipled vulgarian should have even greater appeal to Republicans who will vote in 2020 primaries.Scarborough is a serious man.

The Journal then uses Mr. Schwarzman\u2019s response as a platform to make a policy distinction, to recognize the inherent value of paid leave while opposing the government\u2019s role in administering it: \u201c[O]ur point wasn\u2019t to oppose family leave. The editorial opposed a government plan (\u201cThe Blackstone Entitlement,\u201d Review & Outlook, June 24).By now, many are familiar with the benefits of paid family leave: Healthier children and parents in more tightly bonded families, greater financial stability and stronger attachment to the labor force are among the most important. Unfortunately, those who need these benefits the most aren\u2019t getting them; the poorest, most vulnerable workers in our society get left behind. Currently, only 6% of workers in the bottom income quartile have access to paid family leave. Studies show that these individuals\u2014particularly women without a college degree\u2014are far more likely to lose or quit their jobs in the event of childbirth, resulting in a far greater cost to society over the long term.The policy outlined in the administration\u2019s recent budget proposal emphasizes the need for mothers and fathers to have access to paid leave to encourage both parents to share parenting responsibilities and to strive toward minimizing hiring biases. While this policy will benefit all working parents, it will have an especially positive effect for women, who are far more likely than men to leave the workforce to provide unpaid care for a child. A 2012 study found that women who took paid family leave were more likely to be working a year after their child\u2019s birth than those who didn\u2019t take leave, and that women who took leave and returned to work were 39% less likely to report receiving public assistance than those who didn\u2019t. Additionally, making it easier for new parents to return to work after the arrival of a new baby is a critical part of solving the persistent gender and minority pay gap that exists in part because of prolonged periods away from the workforce and challenges with re-entry.As the Journal also so aptly points out, \u201ca growing economy is the best antidote to inequality.\u201d I agree. Women\u2019s increased participation in the workforce in recent decades has been an important driver of middle-class incomes; in fact, research by the Council of Economic Advisers suggests that the vast majority of middle-income growth since 1970 is the result of increased female labor-force participation and education.Meanwhile, we agree wholeheartedly that government benefits should not be a substitute for private-sector investment. We see a national paid-leave benefit as the necessary floor from which private sector companies and state governments can build.A recent poll by the National Partnership for Women and Families found that 82% of voters think it is important for Congress to consider a paid-leave program. To this end, we are working with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle to design a paid-leave policy that provides a targeted benefit to help the people who need it the most and are least likely to receive it from their employer, without discouraging larger companies from developing more generous policies.The reality is that in 63% of American homes with children, all parents work. Providing a national guaranteed paid-leave program\u2014with a reasonable time limit and benefit cap\u2014isn\u2019t an entitlement, it\u2019s an investment in America\u2019s working families.Ivanka TrumpWashington", "news_time": "2017-07-04 15:14:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/paid-family-leave-is-a-good-national-policy-1499184292", "news_title": "Ivanka Trump Replies on Paid Family Leave", "keywords": "Trump,political,general news,general labor issues,politics,international relations,domestic politics,letters,routine general news"}, {"content": "Italy\u2019s banks can\u2019t seem to avoid controversy. This time it\u2019s the government\u2019s decision last month to wind down Veneto Banca and Banca Popolare di Vicenza rather than subject them to the eurozone\u2019s new bank bail-in rules. This looks like a classic eurozone fudge with Italian characteristics\u2014which it is. But look closer and you\u2019ll find it difficult to fault Rome for its actions.Eyebrows have been raised over the complexity of the process. The banks\u2019 loan books are to be divided into two categories. The performing loans and other good-quality assets, worth some \u20ac26 billion ($29.61 billion), will go to Italy\u2019s largest lender,             Intesa Sanpaolo,       for \u20ac1. The bad loans, with a net value of \u20ac10.3 billion, will go to Societ\u00e0 per la Gestione di Attivit\u00e0 (SGA), established in 1996 as a bad bank to help resolve the Banco di Napoli.This is very different from the bail-in provisions envisioned by the European Union\u2019s directive on bank resolutions. Under those rules, depositors and senior bondholders are supposed to take a haircut in the first instance, with taxpayers entering only as a last resort.Here, however, losses of roughly \u20ac3.7 billion will be concentrated on shareholders and subordinated bondholders. That includes a \u20ac2.5 billion loss for Atlante, the bank-recapitalization fund organized by the government and funded by Italy\u2019s largest banks and other investors, which recapitalized these banks only a year ago.Taxpayers will pay a far larger bill, mainly to Intesa. The Milan-based bank will receive a lump sum of \u20ac4.8 billion to compensate for costs associated with its role in winding down the two banks and to bolster its capital cushion in light of the new assets it\u2019s taking on.Rome also is offering \u20ac12 billion in taxpayer guarantees for any deterioration in the loan portfolio Intesa is buying. The total of \u20ac16.8 billion is around 82% of the funds allocated barely six months ago to shore up Italian banks; the remaining funds will hardly be enough to cover the \u20ac5.4 billion in state aid to Monte dei Paschi di Siena that was just unlocked Tuesday by the European Commission. And this doesn\u2019t factor in Rome\u2019s guarantees to SGA for the nonperforming loans it\u2019s absorbing.Critics are right that this solution runs counter to the spirit of the EU\u2019s bank-resolution rules. But Rome was given little choice. The EU-level banking regulator determined neither bank was systemically significant enough to demand resolution under the EU directive, leaving Rome to decide alone how to proceed. But when Rome determined that the two institutions were indeed significant enough in their regions that they couldn\u2019t be allowed to fail chaotically, other EU rules prohibited a more honest form of socialism that would have benefited taxpayers.Intesa\u2019s involvement was necessitated by EU rules prohibiting outright state aid to banks. Yet Brussels cared only about the form, not the substance, of the ensuing deal. The European Commission liked the fact that the bank assets were being sold in part to a private-sector bidder. It gave no regard to such details as the purely symbolic \u20ac1 price being paid, or the taxpayer benefits that Intesa would enjoy.It would have made much more sense and been less burdensome for Italian taxpayers if Rome had fully taken over the two banks. The SGA \u201cbad bank\u201d could have established an asset-management company to purchase all the assets of the two banks and to fund the operation by issuing asset-backed securities. The inclusion of performing loans in the collateral portfolio would have reduced the state\u2019s direct commitment. That commitment could have been further reduced by the creation of a mezzanine tranche, secured by public guarantees but of limited size and contingent upon the occurrence of enough losses as to fully absorb the junior slice.Yet it would have been a struggle to get such measures approved, especially in the short time in which Rome had to act. The government would have had to argue that the honest socialism of this alternate procedure would have less impact on public finances, and that despite its ties to the government the SGA is a public company. Brussels might have disagreed.In effect, Rome was in a bind. The EU imposes resolution and state-aid rules to create some semblance of restraint on taxpayer rescues for failing banks. But the EU has yet to roll out EU-wide deposit guarantees that might reduce the political pressure on governments to expend taxpayer resources.The result may be the worst of all possible worlds. One irony is for sure: State-aid rules intended to encourage market competition have instead in this case resulted in an enormous taxpayer gift to Intesa, already Italy\u2019s largest bank. The current system is fueling the growth of giant institutions in a way that\u2019s unlikely to be good for the financial market or consumers.Mr. Minenna is a doctoral lecturer at the London Graduate School of Mathematical Finance.", "news_time": "2017-07-04 15:10:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/an-italian-banking-bailout-made-in-brussels-1499195448", "news_title": "An Italian Banking Bailout Made in Brussels", "keywords": " banca popolare di vicenza, bank bailout, banking reform, european commission, european union, intesa sanpaolo,italy, veneto banca,Banca Popolare di Vicenza,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,commentaries,opinions,banking,commercial banking,credit,financial services"}, {"content": "Federal Reserve officials have indicated there is a strong chance they will announce in September a decision to start shrinking the central bank\u2019s portfolio of bonds and other assets, while putting off until December any further interest-rate increase.The moves would give officials time to assess how markets react to the balance-sheet reductions and to confirm their view that a recent slowdown in inflation will fade.Launching the balance-sheet plan in September also would afford Chairwoman       Janet Yellen       an opportunity to initiate it well ahead of any potential leadership transition. Her term as chair expires in February, and President       Donald Trump       hasn\u2019t indicated whether he would nominate her to a second term or replace her.While a final decision on the next Fed moves hasn\u2019t been made, officials will have several opportunities in coming weeks to clarify their thinking. The central bank releases minutes of the June meeting\u00a0on Wednesday, and Ms. Yellen testifies before Congress next week. Officials will also gather in Jackson Hole, Wyo., at the end of August for an annual monetary-policy conference that will provide ample opportunities for them to offer further guidance.Earlier this year, some officials indicated they were considering raising interest rates in March, June and September and then starting the portfolio reduction plan in December. They did raise rates in March and June, but are considering the new strategy for several reasons.First, they agreed at their June policy meeting on how they would reduce the $4.5 trillion portfolio, and made that plan public. Some officials now think they might as well get started soon, given the U.S. economic expansion appears steady and global growth is improving.Second, if Ms. Yellen isn\u2019t nominated to a second term as chair, they would prefer not to wait until December and launch the plan shortly before her successor takes charge.Third, inflation remains a puzzle for the Fed. The unemployment rate fell to 4.3% in May, a 16-year low, yet price pressures have diminished in recent months, moving year-over-year inflation gauges further below the central bank\u2019s 2% target.Some Fed officials in recent weeks have said they want to see more proof that such price softness is transitory before resuming rate increases, but haven\u2019t signaled similar qualms about initiating the balance-sheet runoff.\u201cTake the balance sheet, get that started, and position ourselves for a December rate increase,\u201d said Chicago Fed President       Charles Evans       in an interview last month. Mr. Evans is a voting member of the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee this year.Likewise, St. Louis Fed President       James Bullard,        who doesn\u2019t favor any more rate increases, said last month it was past time for the Fed to start winding down its balance sheet.\u00a0\u201cWe could start the ball rolling. It\u2019s going to roll very slowly anyway,\u201d said Mr. Bullard, who isn\u2019t a voting member, in an interview last month.Fed officials still have time to adjust their plans if the economy faces any surprises. They meet four more times this year, including next on\u00a0July 25-26, and Ms. Yellen holds news conferences following the meetings in September and December, making them the most likely dates to announce the plan.The Fed raised its benchmark federal-funds rate to a range between 1% and 1.25% in June, the third quarter-percentage-point increase in the last three quarters.Despite the Fed\u2019s interest rate increases, financial conditions have mostly eased, with stock markets running to new highs and the dollar falling. Yields on the 10-year Treasury are at 2.35%, up from recent lows but below the 2.64% annual high set in March.The Fed\u2019s portfolio has been shrinking as a share of gross domestic product since 2014, when it stopped adding to its holdings but continued to reinvest the proceeds of maturing assets to maintain the portfolio\u2019s size at $4.5 trillion.The Fed said last month that when it starts allowing the holdings to decline, it will do so gradually by allowing a small amount of bonds to mature every month without any reinvestment. It would start by allowing up to $6 billion in Treasury securities and $4 billion in mortgage bonds to roll off without reinvestment, and let those amounts rise each quarter, essentially setting a speed limit for the wind-down.The limits would ultimately rise to a maximum of $30 billion a month for Treasurys and $20 billion a month for mortgage-backed securities. Fed officials want the balance sheet wind-down to run quietly in the background, meaning they are unlikely to adjust it from one meeting to the next barring a shock to the economy.They have taken pains to avoid a repeat of the costly 2013 \u201ctaper tantrum,\u201d when\u00a0investor concerns over the Fed\u2019s decision to slow down asset purchases triggered market turmoil, including a sharp increase in Treasury yields.\u201cThe plan is one that is consciously intended to avoid creating market strains,\u201d Ms. Yellen said at a news conference last month.Allowing some of the holdings to mature without reinvestment could push up long-term rates, but markets haven\u2019t shown a significant reaction so far. Economists say that partly reflects the relatively slow pace of the initial wind-down as well as officials\u2019 indications the balance sheet will end up at a final size that is relatively large compared with its precrisis level.Officials opened the door to moving as soon as September on the portfolio when they said in their June policy statement the reduction plan could begin \u201cthis year.\u201d\u201cIf the economy evolves in line with our expectations\u2026we could put this into effect relatively soon,\u201d Ms. Yellen said at her June news conference.One potential complication for the Fed: if Congress hasn\u2019t acted to raise the U.S. government\u2019s borrowing limit by the Fed\u2019s September meeting, the central bank may face increased market volatility. Analysts expect the Treasury Department will deplete its cash reserves by early October.Fed officials could ready their portfolio runoff plan but set an effective start date that initiates it after any debt-limit standoff has been resolved. \u201cIf we found ourselves unsure about the Treasury discussions over the debt ceiling, it could be that we make an announcement and then it\u2019s got a little bit of a delay,\u201d said Mr. Evans.Write to Nick Timiraos at nick.timiraos@wsj.comAppeared in the July 5, 2017, print edition as 'Fed Likely to Act Soon on Portfolio Cuts.'", "news_time": "2017-07-04 15:10:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-eyes-september-announcement-on-balance-sheet-reduction-1499195429", "news_title": "Fed Eyes September Announcement on Balance-Sheet Reduction", "keywords": "asset wind-down,balance sheet,federal reserve chairman,interest rates,jackson hole,janet yellen,portfolio,Janet Yellen,Charles Evans,James Bullard,monetary policy,economic news"}, {"content": "KABUL\u2014U.S. senators visiting Kabul on Tuesday including Republican John McCain criticized Secretary of State       Rex Tillerson\u2019s       handling of policy in the country, saying his lack of a strategy could undermine an anticipated U.S. troop surge and that the foreign service there was woefully understaffed.Last month, President       Donald Trump       gave the Pentagon unilateral authority to send thousands more American troops to Afghanistan at its discretion, clearing the way for the U.S. military to intensify its fight against the Taliban and Islamic State extremists in the country.A State Department spokeswoman had no immediate comment.Sen. McCain said the U.S. public wouldn\u2019t tolerate continued American casualties in the country without a clear direction for policy in the region.\u201cWhen they\u2019re dying and wounded, that\u2019s when the American people want to know what the strategy is and when they\u2019re coming home,\u201d he said.Three U.S. soldiers were killed in Afghanistan last month. Some 2,400 U.S. troops have been killed in Afghanistan since a U.S.-led coalition ousted the Taliban from power in 2001. There now are fewer than 9,000 U.S. troops in the country, mentoring local forces and conducting counterterrorism missions.The Pentagon is weighing plans to send between 3,000 and 5,000 troops to bolster Afghanistan\u2019s more than 16-year war, as government control continues to slip in areas including the capital. A decision on the total number of soldiers who will deploy is expected later this month.The U.S. government says the surge in troops would help break a stalemate with the Taliban and induce them to engage in a dialogue for peace.But the Trump administration has yet to outline its political goals for the country, where the Taliban insurgency has made rapid gains since most foreign forces were withdrawn in 2014, creating instability that has led groups including Islamic State to flourish.\u201cYou\u2019re not going to win this war just through more bombing. You\u2019re going to win the war through a whole government approach,\u201d said Sen.       Lindsey Graham,        part of the bipartisan delegation that has been visiting the region. \u201cOn the State Department side, on our side, we are woefully understaffed... I see a lack of focus that is very unnerving.\u201dBefore leaving office earlier this year, former President       Barack Obama       declared an end to major military operations in Afghanistan and dramatically scaled back the U.S. military presence in the country.Last month, a massive truck bomb near central Kabul\u2019s heavily-fortified diplomatic enclave killed some 150 people and wounded hundreds more. It was followed by smaller suicide bombings and violent protests by Afghans who said President       Ashraf Ghani       wasn\u2019t doing enough to protect them.June was also among the deadliest months in years for U.S. troops in the country.Two separate insider attacks saw Afghan forces turn on their U.S. mentors, killing a total of three U.S. soldiers and wounding another seven during both a training exercise in northern Balkh province and an operation in eastern Nangarhar province, where Islamic State\u2019s Afghan affiliate is based.Write to Jessica Donati at Jessica.Donati@wsj.comAppeared in the July 5, 2017, print edition as 'Senators Criticize Tillerson On Policy.'", "news_time": "2017-07-04 15:09:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/senators-criticize-tillerson-over-afghanistan-policy-1499195339", "news_title": "Senators Criticize Tillerson Over Afghanistan Policy", "keywords": "Taliban,Rex Tillerson,political,general news,national,public security,crime,legal action,politics,international relations,domestic politics,risk news,terrorism,military action"}, {"content": "Monogram Residential Trust Inc.

It requires ambition, dedication and persistence. I see this every day as Ukraine introduces wide-ranging reforms to make our country a better place to live, visit and invest. But now that we are at the stage where persistence is essential to realizing our goals, I want to share our progress while showing our commitment to carrying out these changes.When I became prime minister in April 2016, the government\u2019s main challenge was to stabilize our country. We had to establish new rules and greater transparency to fight corruption and create a business-friendly climate. We\u2019ve been working hard, and over the past three years we\u2019ve canceled more than 3,000 regulatory acts\u2014more than during the entire previous 20 years.Now that we have the momentum, the numbers are stacking up, too. After a 17% drop in 2014-15, Ukraine\u2019s gross domestic product grew by 2.3% in 2016, accelerating to 4.7% in the final quarter. A report published by the European Commission last year concluded that we\u2019re making headway at an \u201cunprecedented\u201d level, and the International Monetary Fund has committed $17 billion in financial support for my government\u2019s reform efforts.It\u2019s never been easy, but we\u2019ve insisted on being open and transparent throughout. Under previous rules, subsidized energy prices cost the government around 10% of GDP each year and offered politically connected oligarchs the chance to siphon off billions into their own pockets. That\u2019s why my government deregulated gas prices and substituted energy-tariff subsidies with direct subsidies to households.We implemented these changes a year earlier than our IMF program stipulated. Indeed, we are trying to outpace the international standards for transparency. Last summer, for example, we made it obligatory for state bodies and civil servants to purchase goods and services through an award-winning e-procurement system called Prozorro, developed by Transparency International. This new system automatically publishes details of public spending on an open e-register so that businesses, citizens and investors can be confident that the government is working to support their needs and enable further development.We are proud of our achievements so far, and have identified five priorities in our 2020 Reform Plan: economic growth to create new jobs, higher wages and increased personal wealth; effective governance, aimed at high-quality public services and better control over state funds; combating corruption in order to secure equal rights for all; increasing our security and defense services to protect our citizens; and increasing the availability and quality of health care across the country.Driving these reforms will push us into an exciting new period in our nation\u2019s history, allowing us to open up for global business. We are a member of the World Trade Organization, have a free-trade and visa-free travel arrangement with the European Union, and have recently concluded a free-trade agreement with Canada.We\u2019ve also created the Ukraine Investment Promotion Office to attract even more foreign investment, as well as continually improving our infrastructure and legislation to match the high standards of our highly skilled workforce. A recent European Business Association Investment Attractiveness Index characterized Ukraine\u2019s investment environment as the best it\u2019s been in six years. Foreign direct investment last year totalled $4.41 billion, 17.1% more than in 2015.Ukraine has a bright future, and I\u2019m sure this future will be based on further cooperation with our international partners. I will do everything in my power to make this happen, and the Ukraine Reform Conference meeting in London Thursday will be the first of many opportunities to broaden the coalition around reforms in Ukraine.We have a vision for making sure progress turns into further reform. Our persistence will be the key to making sure Ukraine continues to give our people a brighter future, our allies a stronger partner and our investors more valuable opportunities.Mr. Groysman is the prime minister of Ukraine.", "news_time": "2017-07-04 15:05:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/positive-change-is-happening-in-ukraine-1499195144", "news_title": "Positive Change Is Happening in Ukraine", "keywords": " corruption, economic reforms, gdp growth, international monetary fund,transparency international,ukraine, ukraine reform conference,world trade organization,political,general news,crime,legal action,international relations,politics,domestic politics,commentaries,opinions"}, {"content": "The damaging consequences from       Theresa May\u2019s       election debacle continue to compound, as the Prime Minister\u2019s Tories now want to abandon their claim to fiscal discipline.

Some Tories seem willing to pay for it by reducing scheduled corporate tax-rate cuts or increasing individual taxes by reducing the threshold at which the second-highest 40% rate applies.What a fiasco\u2014political and economic. Britain\u2019s government workers aren\u2019t suffering from a pay crisis compared to their peers in the private (that is, productive) economy. For most of the period since 2000, average weekly nominal earnings for public employees have exceeded the private average, according to the Office for National Statistics. And that excludes government pensions that are far more generous than what most private employees enjoy.Government workers were also shielded from the worst of the post-2008 downturn. The 1% cap amounted to steady nominal wage growth while private wages fell sharply and then rose back modestly\u2014with inflation hurting even more. Government workers were also spared the worst of the job cuts private employers imposed. Central- and local-government employment has fallen by around one million, or 16%, since 2009, but this was accomplished mainly via attrition or modest privatization rather than elimination of departments or roles.The 1% nominal pay cap mainly has given private workers an opportunity to catch up to government pay. The case for scrapping the cap now is that the government might struggle to attract top talent for the many functions it still insists on doing if pay isn\u2019t competitive. That\u2019s possible, but it\u2019s an argument for reducing the number of jobs the government is expected to do rather than paying people more money to do them.The cost of this Labour-lite political redistribution exercise could be as much as \u00a36.3 billion ($8.18 billion) a year to be financed either by more borrowing or higher taxes. Either is a political loser for the Tories. Voters are frustrated by an economic recovery that has largely failed to deliver inflation-adjusted earnings growth. But the solution isn\u2019t to further stifle wage growth in the private economy by raising taxes to benefit public employees.The larger political danger is this signal of early retreat from Mrs. May\u2019s new coalition government. The spending interests will soon be back for more. If the Tories forget that they\u2019re the party of economic growth, not government growth, their defeats have only begun.", "news_time": "2017-07-04 15:05:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-tory-policy-retreat-1499191994", "news_title": "The Tory Policy Retreat", "keywords": "britain, david cameron, george osborne, parliamentary elections, public pay, theresa may, tories, wage cap,Theresa May,government finance,government budget,taxation,economic news,political,general news,general labor issues,politics,international relations,domestic politics,elections,national,presidential elections,editorials"}, {"content": "While working a summer job during college in the early 1990s, I met a law student named Darryl. We became fast friends, eating lunch together most days and sometimes grabbing a beer after work. Darryl came from a prominent local black family with a history of public service. We shared an interest in politics and criminal-justice reform and spent hours that summer discussing issues such as policing, drug policies and the death penalty.After graduating from law school, Darryl took a job as a local prosecutor but wound up hating the work. He told me that he seemed to spend all day, every day prosecuting young black men. I asked him what he expected when he took the position, and he said he didn\u2019t expect it to have the emotional effect it did. He didn\u2019t doubt the guilt of the defendants or believe that these young men found themselves in this situation by dint of some racist conspiracy, but the work just wasn\u2019t for him. He was deeply uncomfortable with his role in the state penal system. After only a couple of years, he left to become an assistant U.S. attorney.I thought about Darryl while reading the new book \u201cLocking Up Our Own: Crime and Punishment in Black America,\u201d by James Forman Jr., a professor at Yale Law School. Before joining the academy, the author spent six years working as a public defender in Washington, and he vividly describes the world that my friend had quit.While leaving court one day in the mid-\u201990s after defending a 15-year-old client named Brandon on gun and drug charges, a \u201cracial reality\u201d dawns on Mr. Forman. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t only Brandon and the other young men in the cellblock who were black,\u201d writes Mr. Forman. \u201cSo was everybody in the courtroom\u2014not just the judge, but the court reporter, the bailiff, and the juvenile prosecutor. So was the police officer who had arrested Brandon, not to mention the police chief and the mayor. Even the building we were in\u2014the H. Carl Moultrie I Courthouse, named after the city\u2019s first black chief judge\u2014was a reminder of the African American influence on D.C.\u2019s legal system.\u201dMr. Forman has written an honest and balanced book about the large role that blacks have played in the mass-incarceration phenomenon he and others on the political left today regularly denounce. \u201cLocking Up Our Own\u201d doesn\u2019t play down the history of racism in our criminal-justice system, but it does explain why racial bias doesn\u2019t tell the whole story. For decades, black officials have pushed for tougher laws against crime in an effort to keep law-abiding blacks safe. And they\u2019ve done so at the urging of their constituents. A 2014 poll asked Americans if courts deal \u201ctoo harshly or not harshly enough\u201d with criminals. Seventy-three percent of whites and 64% of blacks responded \u201cnot harshly enough.\u201dAs Michael Javen Fortner does in his insightful 2015 book about mass incarceration, \u201cBlack Silent Majority,\u201d Mr. Forman delves into a history of the war on drugs that many liberals distort or omit altogether. The federal government\u2019s role in the drug war is \u201conly part of the story,\u201d he explains. \u201cThe nation\u2019s urban centers exercised their own power\u2014especially when it came to policing. And African Americans, often underrepresented in federal and state government, featured prominently in many municipal governments.\u201dSome 130 cities\u2014including New York, Chicago, Houston, Philadelphia, Detroit and Baltimore\u2014had black police chiefs by 1990. More than 300 cities\u2014including Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Detroit, Baltimore and Atlanta\u2014had elected black mayors. \u201cThe words and deeds of these black law enforcement officials and politicians, so often overlooked in histories of the War on Drugs, are crucial to explaining why and how the war developed as it did in American cities,\u201d writes Mr. Forman.Though Mr. Forman worked as a public defender, his empathy for legal adversaries\u2014the Darryls\u2014he faced in court is clear. Of one veteran juvenile prosecutor, he writes: \u201cShe was part of a breed of race-conscious black prosecutors who prodded the system to value the lives of black victims. She was a reminder that for all my claims about punitive criminal justice being a civil rights issue, other black Americans believed just as passionately that rampant crime and violence remained the defining racial justice questions of the day.\u201dIf we are going to have national \u201cconversations\u201d about race in the U.S., a book like \u201cLocking Up Our Own\u201d ought to set the tone. If it did, these debates would be not only more honest but also more civil.", "news_time": "2017-07-04 15:01:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-other-side-of-mass-incarceration-1499194908", "news_title": "The Other Side of Mass Incarceration", "keywords": "political,general news,crime,legal action,commentaries,opinions"}, {"content": "Federal prosecutors in Brooklyn have asked a judge to prevent       Martin Shkreli       from making public commentary about his ongoing securities-fraud trial, saying the high-profile defendant had \u201cembarked on a campaign of disruption\u201d and was \u201cmaking a spectacle of himself and the trial.\u201dIn a motion for a gag order filed Monday night, prosecutors from the Brooklyn U.S. attorney\u2019s office cited the activity of a             Twitter                   account that appears to be run by Mr. Shkreli, as well as an unchaperoned visit Mr. Shkreli made Friday to an overflow viewing room in the courthouse, where he spoke with reporters about witnesses and evidence presented at the trial so far.Citing concerns that Mr. Shkreli\u2019s statements could \u201crender a fair trial impossible,\u201d prosecutors also proposed semi-sequestration of the jury. That could mean the 12 jurors and six alternates would be picked up and dropped off by U.S. Marshals every day and confined to the courthouse even during breaks, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney\u2019s office said.Mr. Shkreli\u2019s lawyer, Ben Brafman, responded in a court filing that his client wasn\u2019t deliberately trying to disrupt the trial but was in a \u201cclearly frail emotional state,\u201d defending himself from what \u201che perceives to be highly prejudicial, one-sided coverage\u201d of the trial.Mr. Brafman\u2019s response didn\u2019t address prosecutors\u2019 claim that Mr. Shkreli, who has been banned from Twitter, was using a new account, with the handle @BLMBro, to address his supporters and taunt reporters and witnesses.Reached Tuesday, Mr. Brafman declined to comment on the allegation concerning Mr. Shkreli\u2019s Twitter use.Mr. Shkreli, 34 years old, is on trial facing charges of conspiracy and securities and wire fraud, stemming from his management of two hedge funds and a publicly traded pharmaceutical company. He has pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing.While the counts aren\u2019t related to Mr. Shkreli\u2019s most notorious actions\u2014jacking up the price of a drug used to treat AIDS patients and spending $2 million on a Wu-Tang Clan album\u2014his public persona has informed nearly every aspect of the trial, from jury selection to the first witnesses.Prosecutors said in Monday\u2019s filing that Mr. Shkreli\u2019s \u201cactive and deeply divisive media presence\u201d was partly why it took nearly three days to select a jury for the trial. At least two dozen prospective jurors, from a pool of more than 300, said they couldn\u2019t be impartial about Mr. Shkreli.Last Tuesday, after one day of jury selection, Mr. Brafman asked for a mistrial, citing a New York Post cover that featured a photo of Mr. Shkreli and an unflattering headline. The mistrial motion was denied.Also that day, Mr. Shkreli claimed on his             Facebook                   page that, for $12 apiece, he had bought the domain names for a CNBC reporter and for the reporter who had written the Post article and was selling them to raise money for his debut rap album. The Twitter account @BLMBro tweeted a similar message.The @BLMBro account has also retweeted statements that prosecutors said aimed to undermine the credibility of witnesses and reporters covering the trial.During the trial\u2019s lunch break on Friday, an unaccompanied Mr. Shkreli entered a second courtroom that had been set up with a live feed of the trial for reporters and spectators. Speaking with several reporters, Mr. Shkreli commented on the government\u2019s evidence and witnesses, before Mr. Brafman came to retrieve him.Later, outside the courthouse, Mr. Brafman said: \u201cI would very much appreciate it if he did not talk to the press because sometimes he doesn\u2019t have a filter.\u201dThe trial is set to resume Wednesday morning.Appeared in the July 5, 2017, print edition as 'Gag Order Sought in Shkreli Trial.'", "news_time": "2017-07-04 15:01:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/prosecutors-in-martin-shkreli-trial-seek-gag-order-1499194898", "news_title": "Prosecutors in Martin Shkreli Trial Seek Gag Order ", "keywords": "@blmbro,ben brafman,drug prices,hedge funds,martin shkreli, pharmaceuticals, prosecutors, shkreli,social media, trial,turing pharmaceuticals,twitter,Martin Shkreli,Ben Brafman,corporate crime,legal action,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,crime,financial crime,fraud,securities fraud,pharmaceuticals,health care,life sciences"}, {"content": "WASHINGTON\u2014Thousands of State Department and U.S. Agency for International Development employees indicated in a survey they are worried about the future of their agencies, with some expressing particular concern about lack of support from the Trump administration and Secretary of State       Rex Tillerson.The findings are in a report for Mr. Tillerson compiled by a consulting firm as he embarks on an effort to reorganize the State Department amid steep budget cuts. The Wall Street Journal reviewed a copy of the report, which is to be released to employees on Wednesday.\u201cI want to reiterate that we began this process with no preconceived notions about the outcome,\u201d Mr. Tillerson will say in a video message accompanying the release of the report, according to a transcript. \u201cOur goal is, and always has been, to address challenges to the way our department operates. Your honesty and candid input is deeply valued as we devote our energy to building a better State Department.\u201dMany of the more than 35,000 State Department and USAID employees responding to the survey indicated longtime frustration with the way the agencies function, including poor technology and duplicative and redundant processes that make frequent workarounds necessary. They also cited pet projects created by ambassadors and Congress, according to the report reviewed by the Journal.USAID employees in the report said they are particularly concerned about the consequences of a move to fully absorb USAID into the State Department, which officials are considering.The 110-page report, which the State Department paid the consulting firm Insigniam about $1.1 million to compile, includes feedback from 35,386 employees of the two interrelated agencies, or about 43% of those who received the survey, and also includes 300 employee interviews conducted in-person or by phone.The report comes as the Trump administration has yet to fill scores of senior State Department positions, which current and former officials say has hampered decision making. The department, which coordinates U.S. diplomatic policy around the world, is contending with threats from North Korea and Russia as it seeks to end long-running wars in the Middle East.Aides said the critical nature of the results reflects Mr. Tillerson\u2019s willingness to incorporate frank feedback into plans for the State Department.\u201cThe first step in this is to give a platform to people to identify what needs to be fixed, the second stage is to give people a platform to fix it, and the third stage is to implement an improved design,\u201d said       R.C. Hammond,        a senior adviser to Mr. Tillerson.The report revealed a wariness among employees about the management at the State Department, including existing structures that are perceived as inefficient and the attitudes of the Trump administration.\u201cPeople do not speak optimistically about the future,\u201d the report says. \u201cThe absence of a clear vision of the future allows room for speculation and rumor about what the future could bring, such as further USAID integration into DOS [Department of State] or the militarization of foreign policy.\u201dState Department employees indicated to Insigniam that they are concerned both about the Trump administration and about Mr. Tillerson\u2019s leadership.\u201cPeople question if these two groups understand the role the Department of State plays in forwarding the interests of the United States in the world,\u201d the report says.One respondent quoted in the report said: \u201cI am concerned that the dramatic reduction in budget, paired with extended staffing gaps at the most senior level, will result in the loss of not only an exceptionally talented group of people from our ranks, but will hamper our impact to fulfill our mission for decades to come.\u201dOther than Deputy Secretary of State       John Sullivan,        there are no Senate-confirmed senior political leaders working at the State Department\u2019s headquarters in Washington.Other themes in the survey included frustration with mechanisms that are supposed to hold employees accountable and outdated technology and structures.\u201cWhether it be models and policies for family-member participation, or medical leave for pregnancies, or a footprint based on a 20th century Cold War world which has evolved into the 21st century\u2019s war on terror, much of what governs day-to-day work is not fit to purpose,\u201d the report says.Eliot Cohen, who served as State Department counselor during the       George W. Bush       administration\u200band is now at Johns Hopkins University, said complaints about the department\u2019s clearance process, bureaucracy and technology are longstanding.Still, he said, the department\u2019s bureaucracy ranks favorably in assessments of government bureaucracies each year: \u201cI would expect [employees] to be in an incredibly sour mood because of the Trump administration.\u200bIf you look at the way [Mr. Tillerson] has dealt with subordinates and the hammering he has taken from the administration...he has an ineffective team.\u201dMr. Tillerson is expected to announce Wednesday that Mr. Sullivan will lead a working group to further examine five areas that were highlighted in the report: overseas operations, foreign-assistance programs, technology, staffing and administration.Those groups will contribute to a report the State Department will submit to the Office of Management and Budget by Sept. 15 about how to reorganize.State Department and USAID employees were asked to address Mr. Tillerson directly, which they did with varying degrees of seriousness. Some were \u201chighly complimentary,\u201d while others were \u201ccoarse and vulgar,\u201d the report said.\u201cWe will be left with only the resources to coordinate among ourselves and write reports,\u201d said one employee, who wasn\u2019t identified in the report. \u201cIt will be a short political win over long-term strategy.\u201dBut another compared the State Department workforce to a Labrador retriever: \u201cWe want to jump in your lap and will be as loyal as the day is long.\u201dWrite to Felicia Schwartz at Felicia.Schwartz@wsj.comAppeared in the July 5, 2017, print edition as 'Employees Vent at State Department.'", "news_time": "2017-07-04 15:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/state-department-workers-vent-grievances-over-trump-tillerson-cite-longer-term-issues-1499194852", "news_title": "State Department Workers Vent Grievances Over Trump, Tillerson, Cite Longer-Term Issues ", "keywords": "diplomacy,foreign policy,russia,state department,tillerson,trump,white house,U.S. Agency for International Development,Department of State,U.S. State Department,Rex Tillerson,Donald Trump,political,general news,international relations,international sanctions,politics,domestic politics,government bodies,executive branch,surveys,polls"}, {"content": "LONDON\u2014Fans with Centre Court tickets on Tuesday came to Wimbledon expecting to see two tournament darlings, Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic, launch their bids for yet another title here. What they got from their buck\u2014or pound\u2014 was a pair of first-round matches that lasted just 82 minutes. Total.In quick succession, Federer and Djokovic both saw their first-round opponents retire due to injury, leaving them with a free pass to the second round and the roughly 15,000 fans packed into Centre Court feeling a little short-changed.\u201cWe had a little joke about it in the locker room, saying we should maybe play a practice set on the Centre Court, have the crowd stay,\u201d Djokovic said of Federer.Martin Klizan pulled out first against Djokovic with trouble in his left leg, while down a set and a break. Then Alexander Dolgopolov quit against Federer, citing a sore knee in exactly the same situation. Wimbledon organizers scrambled to relocate Caroline Wozniacki\u2019s first-round match to Centre Court to stave off the embarrassment of having an empty show court at 6 p.m.The abbreviated afternoon also raised a larger question about how much responsibility players have to declare an injury before they start a match. Even first-round losers earn around $45,200 in prize money at Wimbledon, which is pretty good incentive to make it on court and hobble around, even if it means pulling out one set later.\u201cThe question always is, should they have started the match at all,\u201d Federer said. \u201cThat only the player can answer really, in my opinion.\u201dAfter spotting an uptick in mid-match retirements, the ATP, which runs the men\u2019s tennis tour, tried to curb the practice with a 2017 rule change that allows injured players to retire on-site before the start of a match without forfeiting any prize money. Their spot is then allocated to a so-called \u201clucky loser\u201d from the previous round. (A player may only make use of this provision twice in a single season, according to the ATP rulebook.)But the measure has yet to come into effect at the four Grand Slams. By Tuesday evening, before the completion of Wimbledon\u2019s first round here, six men\u2019s matches had already ended in retirements with five of them lasting two complete sets or less. On the women\u2019s side, only one player failed to see out her match. The discrepancy suggested that men might be less inclined to grit their teeth through injury and hang in a best-of-five match at a Slam than women who play best-of-three.\u201cI\u2019m sure best-of-five sets has something to do with it,\u201d Federer said, adding later that \u201cbest-of-five doesn\u2019t help the case if you\u2019re not feeling great physically.\u201dOf course, Federer pointed out that there is also a case for showing up regardless of how you feel. The guy across the net might feel worse.\u201cMaybe the other guy retires, or maybe the other guy is carrying an injury,\u201d he said. \u201cAll these things play into the equation as well...

According to the auditor, France will not meet the European Union\u2019s target of a deficit under 3% of economic output this year, as the previous government had pledged.\u201cWe are dancing on a volcano that is rumbling louder and louder,\u201d Mr. Philippe said.Repairing France\u2019s public finances is a key plank of Mr. Macron\u2019s economic strategy both at home and on the Continent. The centrist leader is pushing Germany and Chancellor       Angela Merkel       to accept a greater sharing of the burden by eurozone states, pledging in return that France will revamp its labor laws to make the jobs market more flexible and will respect EU budget rules after years of missing targets.Mr. Philippe said his government will cut spending to meet the 3% deficit target this year, and make further cuts to reduce spending by 3 percentage points of economic output over the course of Mr. Macron\u2019s five-year term. The public sector payroll will be contained and no part of the budget will be spared from the search for savings, Mr. Philippe said, noting in particular France spends more than its peers on housing and job training programs.\u201cFrance has an addiction to public spending, which, like any addiction resolves none of the problems it claims to,\u201d Mr. Philippe said.Mr. Philippe, who comes from the center-right Les R\u00e9publicains party, said the government will still deliver Mr. Macron\u2019s election pledges on investment and tax cuts, including a \u20ac50 billion ($57 billion) investment program focused on health and renewable energy, and reductions in corporate and payroll taxes.VIEW InteractiveBut the prime minister said changes to wealth taxes and a tax credit system for employers would not come into effect until 2019. Over the whole five-year term, taxes will fall by 1 percentage point of economic output, he said.France\u2019s largest business lobby, Medef, said it regretted the delay of measures to cut the cost of employment.\u201cThe catastrophic state of our public finances should encourage speedy and determined action,\u201d said Medef chief       Pierre Gattaz.Mr. Philippe also drew criticism from leftists.       Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon,        the leader of the far-left group in the National Assembly, said the policies unveiled by the government amounted to following austerity instructions from Germany that would destroy France\u2019s public services.Referring to the German chancellor, Mr. M\u00e9lenchon said, \u201cWe didn\u2019t elect Ms. Merkel.\u201dWrite to William Horobin at William.Horobin@wsj.comAppeared in the July 5, 2017, print edition as 'French Prime Minister Vows Cuts to Ease Debt Burden.'", "news_time": "2017-07-04 14:45:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/french-prime-minister-warns-of-cuts-to-tame-its-volcano-of-debt-1499193908", "news_title": "French Prime Minister Warns of Cuts to Tame Its \u2018Volcano\u2019 of Debt ", "keywords": " french deficit,french deft,Edouard Philippe,Emmanuel Macron,government finance,government borrowing,economic news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,government bodies,executive branch,derivative securities,commodity,financial market news,sovereign debt derivatives"}, {"content": "The bulb-festooned sign adorning the Eldorado Bumper Cars & Arcade concession in Coney Island has faded to a murky pinkish-grey.

Five global banks were also fined a combined $5.6 billion after pleading guilty to collusion in foreign-exchange markets.Court cases continue for people connected to both scandals.Bank of England Gov. Mark Carney, who chairs the Basel-based standards setter, told leaders of the world\u2019s biggest economies last year that such misconduct had the potential to create a systemic risk for the banking sector because it undermined trust in financial institutions.Since then, the FSB has looked into trading practices in fixed-income, currency and commodity markets to develop a framework to contain misconduct. In a report prepared ahead of the Group of 20 meeting of world leaders later this week in Hamburg, Germany, the FSB said it would devise proposals over the next 12 months to set global guidelines for authorities to implement new rules.During the currency and interest-rate rigging investigations and trials, junior traders said they were only acting under management orders\u2014managers they say weren\u2019t brought to trial or accused of wrongdoing.

Under the U.K. framework, top managers could be found criminally guilty of reckless misconduct.The FSB is assessing similar options. It said it would consider any legal challenges that could limit the application of such solutions on an international basis. It also wants to encourage continuous monitoring of staff\u2014something that could be hindered because of data and privacy laws.Global regulators have linked pay to misconduct since the financial crisis, with politicians clamoring that senior bankers walked away with millions in bonus money and left taxpayers on the hook.Countries such as the Netherlands subsequently placed caps on cash bonuses.

The 27-year-old Sagan, a skilled all-around cyclist, has won eight Tour stages in his career and taken the green \u201cpoints jersey\u201d as the race\u2019s top sprinter every year since 2012.Bike racing\u2019s high-speed sprint finishes are almost always chaotic, full of contact as riders attempt to get position. Video of the Tuesday\u2019s finish appeared to show Sagan elbowing Cavendish toward the barriers as Cavendish attempted to move up alongside Sagan\u2019s right side. Cavendish struck a road barrier and tumbled violently to the pavement, striking a shoulder upon impact. His condition is unknown; he was reportedly sent for X-rays after the race.Officials from Cavendish\u2019s team, Dimension Data were outraged by the maneuver. A             Twitter                   account said to be from Dimension Data team director Rolf Aldag called Sagan\u2019s elbow \u201cnot a race accident.\u201d\u201cHard to DQ a world champion from #LeTour, but needs to be done,\u201d the tweet continued.Cavendish, who has won a staggering 30 stages in his career, is himself known for aggressiveness. In 2009 he was punished by the Tour jury for his tactics in fending off rival Thor Hushovd in a sprint. Cavendish wasn\u2019t disqualified from the race, but had his position \u201crelegated\u201d to the back of the pack for the stage.The decision to remove Sagan from the Tour sent immediate shockwaves through the 104th edition, which began July 1, and it overshadowed the sprint victory by France\u2019s Arnaud D\u00e9mare.\u201cThe disqualification of Peter Sagan is just utter bull----,\u201d tweeted Peter Flax, the former editor of Bicycling magazine.The retired Australian sprinter Robbie McEwen tweeted that he thought Sagan deserved a penalty, but \u201ckicked off the tour?

Just consult your favorite Wall Street telecom analyst.The reasons are twofold. As superfast 5G wireless comes off the drawing board, wireless will be able to compete with cable in delivering lightning-speed broadband and high-def television to the home.At the same time, cable operators own the extensive wired networks needed to provide the \u201cbackhaul\u201d connections that proliferating, \u201cdensified\u201d 5G networks will require.The players also know something else: The cable guys will be the buyers in this coming consolidation wave; the wireless industry, its finances weakened by the \u201cunlimited data\u201d wars, will be the sellers.Which brings us to             Comcast\u2019s       latest machinations. In May, it announced a partnership with the nation\u2019s No. 2 cable giant,             Charter Communications,       to cooperate on their respective forthcoming wireless offerings. They also placed a one-year moratorium on either making a solo bid for a wireless carrier such as T-Mobile or             Sprint.In other words: Let\u2019s not compete to drive up the acquisition price of a wireless carrier when the economics of the wireless marketplace are driving the value of such businesses down.Then came a Journal report last week that cable giants were specifically talking about a joint deal to buy wireless capacity from Sprint to resell it to their own customers.In other words: Let\u2019s work together to drive down the cost of buying and reselling wireless capacity from the struggling wireless industry.These proceedings might seem to test the principle that, for antitrust purposes, cable giants are free to cooperate because local franchise regulation means they really aren\u2019t competitors. Nor would it be the first time Comcast used its deal-making clout to slow a lurch toward industry consolidation. That\u2019s what Comcast chief       Brian Roberts       cleverly did by tying up the regulatory establishment in vetting his ultimately failed 2014 bid for             Time Warner                   Cable.Should you worry about these machinations as a consumer? Not a bit. Think about the 25-year history of the consumer internet. First it was a business of the Baby Bells, delivering dial-up. Then it became a business of the cable operators, who turned one-way TV distribution systems into two-way broadband networks. With the arrival of the iPhone, it became a business of the wireless carriers.Through all these corporate upheavals, the speeds delivered to consumers steadily increased. Last year speeds were up 74% as cable carriers anticipate a new competitive onslaught. Indeed, some might even accuse Comcast\u2019s Mr. Roberts of being a tempering force in an industry otherwise prone to bouts of irrational exuberance and capital wastage.Besides, there\u2019s always             AT&T.       It\u2019s the one wireless giant arguably with all the assets, once it completes its pending acquisition of HBO and other Time Warner entertainment properties, to compete in the new world order without knuckling under to a cable partner like Charter or Comcast. So pull up a chair. The broadband revolution is about to get interesting again.Naturally all this competitive ferment is ignored by those desperately trying to preserve one of the most shortsighted, retrograde twitches of the Obama administration, its effort, in the name of \u201cnet neutrality,\u201d to impose 1934-sytle utility regulation on the consumer broadband business.As sure as the sun rises, that creature of credentialism,       Susan Crawford,        first of the Obama White House, now of the Harvard faculty, supplies a             New York Times op-ed that pretends consumers inhabit a world in which broadband only comes from a local cable monopolist. Mobile doesn\u2019t exist. Consumers don\u2019t tap the internet at work, at the local coffee shop, at countless public Wi-Fi hot spots. They are but helpless patsies of any local cable operator\u2019s desire to slow, filter or bias their web access.But then the \u201cnet neutrality\u201d debate has always been remarkable for proceeding without reference to the real world. Only one question has really interested the professional net-neut activists: Do our efforts advance the rent-seeking, parasite economy that sustains all who inhabit the greater D.C. area?Ajit Pai,        the new Federal Communications Commission chief, has a lot on his hands to help bring the revolution forward. Like what? Like retiring the nation\u2019s traditional copper phone system without leaving its most laggard customers in the lurch. Like easing local overhead and regulatory obstacles to laying new fiber. Like opening up public and private premises for the installation of the small cells that will drive the coming era of ubiquitous high-speed wireless data access.Mr. Pai will have some interesting telecommunications mergers to vet too, and all the while will be fighting off net-neut activists shrieking their well-tried nonsense about a pending \u201cmedia monopoly\u201d and the \u201cdeath of the internet.\u201d But have faith: Technology, especially the technology of superfast wireless, will triumph in the end.Appeared in the July 5, 2017, print edition.", "news_time": "2017-07-04 13:22:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/comcast-vs-the-5g-frenzy-1499188939", "news_title": "Comcast vs. the 5G Frenzy", "keywords": "5g,broadband,comcast,net neutrality,Charter Communications,CHTR,Comcast,CMCSA,corporate,industrial news,commentaries,opinions,telecommunication services,wireless telecommunications services,mobile telecommunications,internet service providers (discontinued from 11th july 2017),broadcasting,cable broadcasting,internet,online,media,entertainment,technology"}, {"content": "Democratic analysts have begun a long-overdue review of their party\u2019s weakness among white working-class voters. Because postelection research has shown that immigration is important to these Americans, the review has brought to the surface a long-suppressed debate among Democrats about this contentious issue.More than politics is at stake. The basic architecture of today\u2019s immigration policy was enacted more than half a century ago. Immigrants\u2019 share of the U.S. population has since tripled while economic opportunities for low-skilled workers have diminished. It is not unreasonable to ask whether a 1965 law is suitable for today\u2019s economy and society.Among the Democrats weighing in is       Stanley Greenberg,        a veteran pollster who came to prominence in the mid-1980s for his study of \u201cReagan Democrats\u201d in Macomb County, Mich. A month into the       Trump       presidency, Mr. Greenberg returned to Macomb County and interviewed white working-class Trump supporters who had previously voted for       Barack Obama.       \u201cIt was clear,\u201d he reports, \u201chow central concerns about immigration, borders, foreignness, and Islam were to their receptivity to his call to take back America. Many thought [Hillary] Clinton, on the other hand, wanted \u2018open borders.\u2019\u00a0\u201d As they saw it, \u201cDemocrats have moved from seeking to manage and champion the nation\u2019s growing diversity to seeming to champion immigrant rights over American citizens\u2019.\u201dDuring a public event convened by the liberal magazine American Prospect, Mr. Greenberg was blunt about the political implications of his findings. \u201cYou can only succeed if people believe you want to manage immigration,\u201d he declared. Every center-left party in the West is struggling with this issue, he warned. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s fatal.\u201dA week later,       Peter Beinart       of the Atlantic entered the fray. As recently as a decade ago, he pointed out, progressives were willing to entertain tough questions about immigration. In 2006       Paul Krugman      wrote that \u201cimmigration reduces the wages of domestic workers who compete with immigrants\u201d and that \u201cthe fiscal burden of low-wage immigrants is also pretty clear.\u201d His conclusion: \u201cWe\u2019ll need to reduce the inflow of low-skill immigrants.\u201d As recently as 2014, Mr. Krugman said that \u201cif you don\u2019t feel conflicted about these issues, there\u2019s something wrong with you.\u201dAlso in 2006 a young senator declared: \u201cWhen I see Mexican flags waved at pro-immigration demonstrations, I sometimes feel a flush of patriotic resentment. When I\u2019m forced to use a translator to communicate with the guy fixing my car, I feel a certain frustration.\u201d That was Barack Obama.By 2015 these economic and cultural doubts were out of bounds for Democrats with political aspirations. Early in his campaign Sen.       Bernie Sanders       was pilloried for suggesting that low-skilled immigrants would depress wages for American workers. He quickly retreated, even though the facts were mainly on his side. If he had been feeling brave, he might have cited a National Academies of Sciences report that found today\u2019s immigrant-headed families with children are disproportionately likely to rely on food stamps and Medicaid\u2014and slower than their predecessors to learn English.The constriction of Democratic debate is part of a larger problem facing today\u2019s upscale liberals, who are fixated on cultural issues. In October 2016, progressive stalwart       Robert Kuttner      wrote in the American Prospect that it is hard to tell white working-class voters to check their privilege when they are so much worse off than their parents. \u201cThe charge of political correctness, used so deftly by Trump, resonates with white workaday voters in part because liberals seem to give priority to every other downtrodden group, from illegal aliens (sic) to transgender people to brown pelicans.\u201d The \u201csic\u201d was Mr. Kuttner\u2019s.In a recent issue of Foreign Affairs, two staunch liberal internationalists point to the politics of immigration as the principal obstacle to a sustainable balance between openness and national solidarity. \u201cIt is not bigotry,\u201d write       Jeff Colgan       and       Robert Keohane,        \u201cto calibrate immigration levels to the ability of immigrants to assimilate and to society\u2019s ability to adjust.\u201dA new immigration policy need not mean surrendering to nativism. A recent study by the Public Religion Research Institute found majorities of Republicans as well as Democrats who favor a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants, provided that they meet certain conditions. By contrast, support for identifying and deporting them is low in every sector of the population.Humane treatment for those already here is compatible with a fundamental shift from an immigration policy focused on family reunification to one that prizes education and skills and emphasizes the rapid attainment of English fluency.

The unemployment rate is at a 15-year low, but only 55% of Americans adults 18 to 64 have full-time jobs. Nearly 95 million people have removed themselves entirely from the job market.According to demographer       Nicholas Eberstadt,        the labor-force participation rate for men 25 to 54 is lower now than it was at the end of the Great Depression. The welfare state is largely to blame. More than a fifth of American men of prime working age are on Medicaid. According to the Census Bureau, nearly three-fifths of nonworking men receive federal disability benefits.The good news is that the 1996 welfare reform taught us how to reduce government dependency and get idle Americans back to work. Attaching work requirements to social benefits like Medicaid, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (food stamps), Social Security Disability Insurance and Supplemental Security Income would make what these pages have called \u201cAmerica\u2019s growing labor shortage\u201d a nonissue.According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, 41% of nondisabled adults on Medicaid do not have jobs. Thirteen million Americans 18 to 54 currently receive SSDI or SSI benefits. Conservatively, work requirements could add 25% of that population (3.3 million workers) back to the labor force. Work requirements for people on SNAP would increase the worker rolls by 1.9 million if only 10% who are not engaged in work rejoined.There\u2019s no question that insisting on work in exchange for social benefits would succeed in reducing dependency. We have the data: Within 10 years of the 1996 reform, the number of Americans in the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program fell 60%. But no reform is permanent. Under President       Obama,        federal poverty programs ballooned.A better long-term solution to the work shortage would be to eliminate all forms of public support except for those who are unable to work, and eliminate all poverty programs, since they have not reduced poverty since they were established in 1965. The money currently being spent on these programs should be redirected to job creation\u2014preferably for private-sector jobs, but public-sector jobs will do in a pinch. A trillion-dollar federal infrastructure program, such as the one President       Trump       has said he will propose, could absorb a large number of the unemployed and underemployed.There are other avenues to pursue. For young men who are not working, a mandatory two-year public-service requirement with an off-ramp for those who snag a job could motivate them to get off\u2014and stay off\u2014the couch.Too many Americans who could be available to help fuel robust economic growth are instead sitting on the sidelines.

Spokesman       Lu Kang       said that the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration was a \u201chistorical document that no longer has any realistic meaning.\u201dNo, that doesn\u2019t mean the Brits can take back Hong Kong, much as some of the city\u2019s residents might wish that were possible. Instead it\u2019s a sign that China intends to renege on its promise in the treaty, registered at the United Nations, to give the territory \u201ca high degree of autonomy.\u201d The local government foreshadowed this decision last year when it made a subtle change to its website. It altered the slogan \u201cHong Kong people ruling Hong Kong,\u201d coined by       Deng Xiaoping,        to \u201cHong Kong people administering Hong Kong.\u201dIn a 2014 white paper denying Hong Kong democracy, the Chinese State Council asserted that certain promises in the Joint Declaration were not binding as international law on grounds that Beijing wrote them. Since China was the author, Beijing is therefore free to change the terms or declare them to be no longer valid. By that logic, all treaties China signs are meaningless because China will be a party to their language. It\u2019s hard to see why any government would conclude a treaty with Beijing when it views such agreements as binding only as long as they are expedient.Chinese leaders have long memories and they bear a historical grudge against the treaties that Western nations imposed on a weak China in the late 19th century. But China\u2019s response more than a century later is to impose its own version of diplomatic blackmail on weaker nations, as it is attempting to do in the South China Sea. Only Japan\u2019s resistance is preventing something similar in the East China Sea.Britain is too afraid of China, or too concerned for its commercial interests, to protest violations of the Joint Declaration and stick up for the citizens of its former territory. But the self-governing citizens of Taiwan will surely notice how Beijing has disavowed the autonomy promised to Hong Kong and dishonored the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d formula that Deng once offered as a model for Taiwan\u2019s eventual return to the motherland.As their double game with the U.S. over North Korea shows (see nearby), China\u2019s current leaders put regional dominance above global order.

In late June, Candice Jackson, who in April became acting head of the department\u2019s Office for Civil Rights, made her first public remarks about the regulatory regime she inherited. Ms. Jackson said she is examining her predecessors\u2019 work but offered no specifics about when, or if, Obama-era mandates will be changed.Beginning in 2011, the Obama administration used Title IX\u2014the federal law banning sex discrimination at schools that receive federal funds\u2014to pressure colleges and universities into adopting new procedures for handling sexual-misconduct complaints. At most schools, accused students already faced secret tribunals that lacked basic due-process protections. But the Education Department mandated even more unfairness. It ordered schools to lower the standard of proof to \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d instead of the \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d standard that some schools had used. It required schools to permit accusers to appeal not-guilty findings and discouraged allowing students under investigation to cross-examine their accusers.As a result, scores of students have sued their colleges, alleging they were wrongfully accused. They have won more than 50 decisions in state and federal court since 2012, while nearly 40 complaints have been dismissed or decided in the colleges\u2019 favor.Ms. Jackson has already reversed another Obama-era policy that sought to tip the scales in favor of accusers. Earlier this year, BuzzFeed revealed that her predecessor,       Catherine Lhamon,        had ordered that whenever someone filed a Title IX complaint against a school with the Education Department, the civil-rights office would investigate every sexual-assault allegation there over several years. The shift sometimes led to reopening cases in which accused students already had been cleared. Ms. Jackson argued last week that this policy\u2014which Ms. Lhamon never announced publicly\u2014treated \u201cevery complaint as a fishing expedition through which our field investigators have been told to keep searching until you find a violation rather than go where the evidence takes them.\u201dThese first signs of renewed fairness have elicited strong protests. Last week 34 Democratic senators, led by Washington\u2019s Patty Murray, sent a letter to Education Secretary       Betsy DeVos       accusing her of endorsing \u201cdiminished\u201d enforcement of federal civil-rights laws. The senators did not even make a pretense of caring about due process for the accused. Congressional Republicans have mostly remained silent.Late last month a task force appointed by Gov.       Chris Christie       released a report on how New Jersey institutions should respond to sexual assault on campus. The panel, dominated by academic administrators and victim advocates, based most of its work on the assumption that university investigations are meant to validate accusations rather than test them.The report urged Garden State schools to ensure that \u201cequal representation is provided to survivors and the accused\u201d and to develop \u201can investigation and adjudication model that honors the survivor [and] the respondent.\u201d To describe an accuser as a \u201csurvivor\u201d before the complaint is adjudicated is to prejudge the case.       Patricia Teffenhart,        one of the task force\u2019s leaders, implicitly concedes the point: She told me the panel did intentionally \u201cinterchange (at times) the words \u2018survivor\u2019 and \u2018complainant,\u2019\u00a0\u201d so as to \u201cavoid seeming to be one-sided.\u201dMs. Teffenhart added that the task force paid \u201cspecific attention\u201d to the accused\u2019s ability to mount a defense, and the report does recommend that schools appoint an \u201cadviser\u201d for students charged with sexual assault. But it neuters that safeguard by urging colleges to ensure the adviser is \u201cwithout a voice\u201d in disciplinary hearings. That leaves students who have no legal training to fend for themselves, often against college lawyers or administrators who know and control the proceeding.A mid-June report on campus sexual assault from, of all organizations, the American Bar Association also played down the importance of lawyers to a fair disciplinary process. The ABA task force recommended that if a college does permit accused students to have a lawyer\u2014and many don\u2019t\u2014cross-examination by the defense should be forbidden. In the ABA\u2019s view, lawyers should submit questions to the disciplinary panelists, who can then decide whether, and in what form, to ask them.The Supreme Court has called cross-examination \u201cthe greatest legal engine ever invented for the discovery of truth.\u201d The ABA urges its abolition on campus to prevent \u201cthe potential trauma from having a victim be directly questioned by her assailant\u201d\u2014again, presuming the accused student guilty.The ABA at least expressed concern about the preponderance-of-evidence mandate. But numerous proposals from blue-state legislators have sought to codify this and other prejudicial procedures into state law. California already has done so. Meanwhile, six California schools have been on the losing end of lawsuits filed by accused students. And in the highest-profile university victory, an appellate judge compared the University of California, San Diego\u2019s procedure to a kangaroo court during oral arguments, only to uphold it when he and two colleagues decided the case.Ms. Jackson has one of the most thankless jobs in Washington\u2014seeking to vindicate procedural norms and basic fairness on an issue that triggers intense emotional responses.

The symbolism of launching on America\u2019s Independence Day was surely no accident, but the technical feat is more consequential. The speed of North Korea\u2019s progress toward threatening the U.S. with a fleet of nuclear-tipped ICBMs requires an urgent response.Tuesday\u2019s missile, dubbed the Hwasong-14, has an estimated range of 6,700 kilometers, which puts Alaska within range. America\u2019s lower 48 states may still be out of reach, but the test shows the North has overcome most of the obstacles to a long-range missile. The apparent success will provide more data on the remaining problems, such as a warhead capable of withstanding extremes of temperature and vibration.One crucial question is whether the new missile is based on the Hwasong-12, an intermediate-range missile successfully tested on May 14. As we wrote at the time, that rocket was apparently a single-stage design and thus a good candidate to become the first stage of an ICBM. The regime has heretofore used engines cobbled together from Russian and Chinese missiles for its ICBM program.The Hwasong-12 was designed from scratch, and its new engine is more sophisticated than anything the regime had produced. If the North has now attached a second stage, the U.S. will have to advance the estimates of when Los Angeles and Chicago could come under direct threat.The Trump Administration now has some hard decisions to make as it contemplates its Korea options. More sanctions put the Kim regime under pressure and thus are worth doing, but they can\u2019t be relied on to disarm the North in time. Like its allies South Korea and Japan, the U.S. will soon be vulnerable to attack by a regime that has an estimated 20 nuclear warheads as well as chemical and biological weapons. A pre-emptive U.S. military attack can\u2019t be ruled out but risks a nuclear counterstrike on South Korea if even one North Korean missile survives.China, the dovish new South Korean government and the U.S. left are pressing for more disarmament talks in return for a \u201cfreeze\u201d on Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear programs. But three U.S. administrations have tried diplomacy and failed. The freeze would be phony and the North would break out again when it feels its demands for more money and recognition aren\u2019t being met.The best option is a comprehensive strategy to change the Kim regime, as former Undersecretary of State       Robert Joseph       has argued. Washington must strengthen deterrence and build out missile defenses, revive the Bush Administration\u2019s antiproliferation dragnet, convince countries in the region to cut their ties with North Korea, consider shooting down future Korean test missiles, and spread news about the regime\u2019s crimes to people in the North.The U.S. will also have to recognize that Beijing is part of the problem. North Korea\u2019s trade with China grew by 37.4% in the first quarter, contributing to an economic miniboom. Chinese companies are cashing in on the North\u2019s mineral resources and cheap labor while supplying the dual-use materials and technology for its nuclear and missile programs.The U.S. has held out hope that China\u2019s leaders would see that a nuclear-armed North Korea isn\u2019t in its interests. But Beijing\u2019s behavior suggests that it hopes the North Korean threat will drive the U.S. out of Northeast Asia. Only a much tougher strategy aimed at toppling the Kim regime, with or without China\u2019s help, has a chance of eliminating a threat that puts millions of American lives at risk.", "news_time": "2017-07-04 13:09:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-north-korean-missile-crisis-1499188198", "news_title": "The North Korean Missile Crisis", "keywords": " hwasong-14, intercontinental ballistic missile, missile defense,north korea, nuclear weapons, sanctions,political,general news,national,public security,armed forces,weapons programs,editorials"}, {"content": "BRUSSELS\u2014The European Union\u2019s executive branch Tuesday promised Italy an extra \u20ac35 million in a bid to quell tensions in the bloc over how to respond to an increasing number of migrants crossing the Mediterranean from Libya.The Italian government, which estimates having to spend \u20ac4 billion on the migration crisis this year, in recent weeks stepped up calls on fellow EU governments to share the migrant burden. Rome\u2019s main request was for France and Spain to open their ports to ships rescuing migrants from Europe-bound dinghies. Over 2,000 people died this year on the perilous sea journey. Italy rescued and brought to its shore over 85,000 migrants this year, compared with 71,000 over the same period of time last year, according to the International Organization for Migration.But in meetings with French, German and EU officials over the weekend, it became clear that no major response was to be expected from the bloc, apart from more funding for housing of refugees and speedier deportations of those denied asylum. According to the UNHCR, the United Nations\u2019 refugee agency, just 30% of the people who arrive in Italy are eligible for asylum, the rest being so-called economic migrants who can be sent back home.\u201cWe will show full solidarity with Italy in this struggle...if it needs more money in certain areas, we will find the funds to make sure Italy can build up its capacities faster than before,\u201d European Commission Vice President       Frans Timmermans       said during a news conference in Strasbourg, France.The EU\u2019s 28 interior ministers will discuss the Italian situation on Thursday in Tallinn, the capital of Estonia, with the commission urging them to take more refugees from Italy under a 2015 relocation program.The rising influx and fears that Italy won\u2019t be able to keep all migrants in the country have reignited tensions with Italy\u2019s northern neighbor Austria. Austrian Defense Minister       Hans Peter Doskozil       told Austrian newspaper Krone that his country is preparing for tougher border controls and said that deploying some 750 soldiers at the border would be \u201cindispensable\u00a0if the influx to Italy doesn\u2019t get smaller.\u201d Italy and Austria are part of the border-free Schengen area but police checks in the border area have been reinstated since 2015, when the migration crisis peaked and some 1 million people arrived on the continent, mainly via Turkey and Greece.Italy\u2019s main opposition party, the 5 Star Movement, said that threats from neighboring countries to close their borders show that \u201ctoday Europe has definitely died. Italy must worry about its own destiny and immediately close its ports to foreign ships carrying migrants.\u201dGiven allegations in Italy that nongovernmental organizations are colluding with migrant smugglers to facilitate their journey to Europe, the commission has backed the initiative of Italian authorities to draft a so-called code of conduct for NGOs involved in rescue operations at sea.UNHCR special envoy for the Central Mediterranean Vincent Cochetel said that 41% of the people rescued at sea have been rescued by private ships operated by NGOs. \u201cOn these allegations of colluding with traffickers, either you have proof and bring those people to justice or you shut up,\u201d he said.As for assistance to Libya, the European Commission said \u20ac46 million will be directed at training the Libyan defense ministry\u2019s coast guard and security forces on the southern border, in a bid to stem the migration flow. However the government in Tripoli doesn\u2019t control most of the Libyan territory and rivaling militias having set up their own coast guards and detention centers for migrants, with aid workers unable to access most of those facilities, according to the UNHCR.\u201cAre we trying to make sure that these people stay in Libya, where there is no law and order and the security situation is very fragile? It would be very sad if we\u2019d turned into that kind of a European Union,\u201d said       Eugenio Ambrosi,        the head of IOM\u2019s Europe office.A representative of Amnesty International called the European Commission\u2019s action \u201ca woefully inadequate plan that does little to address the dire situation in the Central Mediterranean and the lack of EU solidarity.\u201d       Iverna McGowan,        Europe director with the group, added that \u201cOutsourcing more and more responsibility for search and rescue to the Libyan coast guard is irresponsible and ineffective and has led to more deaths at sea.\u201d\u2014Andrea Thomas in Berlin and Eric Sylvers in Milan contributed to this article.Write to Valentina Pop at valentina.pop@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-04 13:01:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/eu-promises-italy-more-aid-for-migrant-crisis-1499187718", "news_title": "EU Promises Italy More Aid for Migrant Crisis", "keywords": " 35 million euros, eu, european commission,european union,europe migrant crisis, italy, libya, mediterranean, migrants, sea rescue,unhcr,European Commission,European Union,International Organization for Migration,political,general news,crime,legal action,migration,politics,international relations,domestic politics,trafficking,smuggling"}, {"content": "U.S.-backed Syrian forces have breached the wall surrounding Raqqa\u2019s heavily fortified Old City, marking a significant advance in the battle to drive Islamic State out of a city it used to run its empire and plan attacks abroad, the American military said Tuesday.The Syrian Democratic Forces made the breakthrough on Monday after the U.S.-led coalition battling Islamic State conducted airstrikes on the wall, according to the U.S. Central Command. The Kurdish-led SDF fighters came under heavy fire as they entered, Central Command said.The advance is the SDF\u2019s deepest yet into Raqqa. If the city falls, it would be one of the biggest achievements in about four years of war against Islamic State led by the Pentagon and its coalition of Western and Arab allies.Although coalition forces have now entered Raqqa\u2019s Old City, Islamic State is still putting up very tough resistance, a coalition spokesman said, portending a drawn-out battle for the city.The spokesman declined to say when Raqqa city might be completely recaptured.But as coalition forces advance toward the city\u2019s more urbanized core, the fighting will likely become more protracted as it has when Islamic State has been uprooted in U.S.-backed military campaigns from Libya to Iraq.\u201cThere is still tough fighting to be done,\u201d the coalition spokesman said. \u201cISIS fighters are putting up stiff resistance,\u201d he added, saying the militants have booby trapped the city and surrounding areas with explosives, making it slow going.Islamic State has suffered a series of defeats in both Syria and Iraq that have eaten away at its territorial foothold in its core caliphate, or religious empire. The group is all but banished from Mosul, Iraq\u2014the largest city it had captured in the Middle East\u2014after more than eight months of battles.Some of the last remaining residents streamed out of Mosul\u2019s old city on Tuesday as Iraqi troops, backed by U.S. Special Forces, continued to inch forward.The SDF, a mixed Kurdish and Arab force, launched the long-awaited offensive to retake Raqqa in early June, more than three years after Islamic State took the city that became known as its de facto capital of its self-declared caliphate in Syria. The U.S. has said the militants used the area as a staging ground for terrorist attacks on Europe and that the loss of it would be a major blow to Islamic State.Across Syria and Iraq, hundreds of U.S. Special Forces are supporting local partners, advising them in battle and calling in airstrikes.Islamic State\u2019s key leadership has already moved on further eastto Deir Ezzour province, specifically to Mayadeen, a small city there. Oil-rich Deir Ezzour is still mostly in Islamic State hands and the group is expected to put up a tough fight there after the Raqqa and Mosul offensives are over.Damascus and its allies, namely Iran, Russia and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, are likely to take Islamic State\u2019s holdouts in Deir Ezzour, making the battle for Raqqa likely to be the last significant urban territory U.S.-allied forces will wrest away from Islamic State.The extremist militants also still hold several strategically important towns in Iraq and a stretch of the Iraq-Syria border.In Raqqa, Islamic State has used the Old City wall as a fighting position and planted mines and other explosives at several breaks in it, the U.S. military said. The military added that it was gauging airstrikes to try to preserve as much as possible of the historic 2,500-yard wall.The spokesman of the Manbij Military Council, which is fighting under the umbrella of the SDF in southern Raqqa, said this advance was \u201chuge and a victory.\u201d He said the forces that entered the Old City seized a strategic outpost from Islamic State, an ancient, fortified palace known as Qasr al-Banat.\u201cWe are certain of victory. It is inevitable, but we cannot give a specific time,\u201d Sharfan Darwish said. \u201cISIS is completely besieged.\u201dThe spokesman also claimed that some ISIS fighters have handed themselves over to the SDF.\u201cTheir morale is collapsing,\u201d he said.An estimated 200,000 people are trapped in Raqqa amid heavy bombardment, and civilian casualties will likely rise as street-to-street urban warfare intensifies.Residents interviewed last month said that many civilians have found it difficult to escape the city given incessant coalition airstrikes and the dangerous minefields Islamic State has planted. The militants have banned civilians from leaving.Write to Maria Abi-Habib at maria.habib@wsj.comAppeared in the July 5, 2017, print edition as 'Islamic State\u2019s \u2018Capital\u2019 Is Breached.'", "news_time": "2017-07-04 12:49:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/us-backed-forces-breach-wall-around-raqqas-old-city-1499159905", "news_title": "U.S.-Backed Forces Squeeze Islamic State by Breaching Raqqa Wall", "keywords": " euphrates river, is,isis, islamic state,mosul,raaqa, syrian democratic forces, syrian observatory for human rights,political,general news,national,public security,crime,legal action,armed forces,politics,international relations,domestic politics,risk news,terrorism,government bodies,defense department,executive branch,military action"}, {"content": "As Mongolian voters go to the polls Friday for a runoff election to choose their fifth president, their most pressing concern should be which of the two candidates is most likely to tackle the country\u2019s dependence on debt.The two contenders are Battulga Khaltmaa of the Democratic Party and Enkhbold Miyeegombyn of the Mongolian People\u2019s Party (MPP). Mr. Battulga, a flamboyant businessman turned politician who named his company Genco after the Corleone olive-oil business in the film \u201cThe Godfather,\u201d has strongly criticized the influence of China and the International Monetary Fund in Mongolia\u2019s economy.Mr. Enkhbold presents himself as a voice of stability and continuity. He is best known for his years as the mayor of Ulaanbaatar, where startlingly rapid expansion of building construction was so unpopular that his opponents badly outpolled him among city voters in the first round of this election before he eked out a second-place finish with support from the rural areas.Whoever wins will have to confront the fact that Mongolia today, from the national authorities down to the rural herders, is mired in high-interest debt, and is adding more to the burden every day.In March, Mongolia came perilously close to defaulting on a $580 million Eurobond. A $5.5 billion package of loan commitments, made possible through the IMF, helped avoid such an outcome.This package will lower the cost of financing the budget deficit, projected to be 10.4% of gross domestic product this year, and the cost of refinancing foreign-currency bonds that will mature in the coming years. But it doesn\u2019t resolve the underlying solvency problem.In addition to the IMF-led loan package, Mongolia continues to take on other new low-interest foreign-currency debt, such as a new $1 billion \u201csoft loan\u201d from India. It also continues to assume high-interest domestic debt: In the past two months, more than $250 million in bonds of maturities from 12 weeks to 3 years were issued with 13% weighted average interest rate.Even under the optimistic fiscal assumptions of the new IMF agreement, already-issued commercial-market bonds will have to be rolled over as they mature. This pattern is likely to continue unless the country\u2019s leaders identify the root of the problem.Just five years ago, the 17% economic growth of \u201cMinegolia\u201d was the envy of the world due to a large inflow of foreign direct investment, primarily into the mining sector, but also into support sectors such as services, property, tech and finance. Mongolia\u2019s abundant copper, coal, iron, gold, uranium, oil and other resources, and its location on the border of China\u2019s heartland, earned the country the nickname \u201cDubai of Asia.\u201dThen the resource curse struck. In Mongolia, it wasn\u2019t so much a currency overvaluation or a cyclical downturn in commodity prices but a decline in serious economic policy making. Nationalistic rhetoric and ham-handed attempts to renegotiate signed agreements drove FDI away, while debt-financed spending exploded despite slowing growth and budget revenues.Sustainable FDI-fueled growth turned overnight into unsustainable debt-fueled growth. From 2011 to 2016, FDI plunged to almost zero from $4.5 billion a year, and public external debt as a share of GDP rose to 90% from 24.1%.Now the debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to reach at least 118% of GDP by 2020.Private domestic debt also exploded in this period, at punishingly high interest rates. Domestic credit rose 350%, and loans to individuals rose 20-fold to nearly half the total. More than half of Mongolian households have bank loans outstanding, with annual interest averaging more than 20%. Inflation is 3%.A combination of international good will and faith in the country\u2019s economic potential due to its resource endowment has now created a dangerous sense of complacency among all parties, especially the Mongolian government. Time after time Mongolia has been rescued from economic crises by loans from abroad. But there are now clear signs that things aren\u2019t going to end well without a sharp change in direction.In early 2015, an IMF debt-sustainability analysis concluded that Mongolia was at considerable risk of debt distress. But the government ignored the IMF\u2019s advice to tighten macroeconomic policy. In 2015 and 2016, through a program of cash handouts, salary increases and other big-spending programs\u2014all financed by external and domestic borrowing\u2014Mongolia blew up the budget deficit to 20% of GDP.That borrowing culminated in a $500 million bond in May 2016, with an incredible 10.875% coupon. Even with this borrowing, and a large credit-swap line between Mongolian and Chinese central banks, official reserves plunged to their lowest level in six years.The new MPP government that took office last summer made some progress in reversing the growth of the budget deficit. But the relatively small tax increases and spending cuts that are in the IMF agreement won\u2019t change the dangerous underlying trend. Some of those cuts, aimed at essential social programs, could pose social and political risks to stability.The office of Mongolia\u2019s president has limited powers, but it can exert influence over policy. Whoever wins the election Friday should seize this opportunity to encourage the country to face up to its perilous debt situation and accept the need to live within its means and return to sustainable FDI-led growth. At the very least, the president-elect should abide by Hippocrates\u2019 words, \u201cFirst, do no harm\u201d and not advocate populist steps that will make the likelihood of a crisis even greater.Mr. Bikales is an economist who has advised many Mongolian governments since 1991.", "news_time": "2017-07-04 12:45:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/mongolias-economic-choice-1499186721", "news_title": "Mongolia\u2019s Economic Choice", "keywords": " economic policy, elections, foreign direct investment,mongolia, public debt,economic performance,indicators,economic growth,government finance,government borrowing,economic news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,elections,national,presidential elections,commentaries,opinions"}, {"content": "Global stocks retreated Tuesday as investors doubt whether technology companies can continue to lead markets higher.The Stoxx Europe 600 edged down 0.3% following steeper losses across Asia, while U.S. markets were closed for the Fourth of July holiday.Technology shares lagged behind wider exchanges in Europe and led declines in Japan, Hong Kong, and Australia as a setback in U.S. technology companies the previous day reverberated overseas.

In turn, Uber shouldn\u2019t be prosecuted on the basis of those laws, the company has argued.Under European Union law, countries are supposed to first notify any national legislation regulating an \u201cinformation society service,\u201d or web platforms, to the European Commission, the bloc\u2019s executive. But France didn\u2019t do that before pushing the 2014 law aimed at curtailing Uber through its legislature.One provision of the French law made it a crime punishable by prison and fines to link people in search of a ride with drivers who have no professional license\u2014as Uber\u2019s then-active low-cost service Uberpop did. Only after authorities arrested and charged the company\u2019s top two executives in France, and the country\u2019s interior minister dressed down other executives in his office, did the firm shut down Uberpop.Maciej Szpunar,        an advocate general at the ECJ, said notification of the French rules wasn\u2019t necessary because they weren\u2019t specifically designed to regulate IT services.\u201cMember states may prohibit and punish the illegal exercise of a transport activity such as Uberpop without having to notify the commission of the draft law in advance,\u201d Mr. Szpunar said Tuesday.Uber spokeswoman       Marloes van der       Laan said in response: \u201cWe have seen today\u2019s statement and await the final ruling later this year.\u201d The company has changed its ways since the French law was implemented and now only operates with professional licensed drivers in France, Ms. Van der Laan said.Uber is hoping that a decision in its favor could bolster its appeal of the conviction of the two executives who, along with Uber, were fined a total of about \u20ac964,000 ($1.1 million).That conviction also included other charges, such as privacy violations, which wouldn\u2019t be affected by the current ECJ case. A decision in the appeal to the French court conviction is expected at the end of the year.The case in Tuesday\u2019s opinion stems from Uber\u2019s pugilistic approach to its legal battles world-wide. In Europe, one of the firm\u2019s main strategies has been to try to use the EU\u2019s free-market treaties to beat back restrictive transport regulations at a national level in any way possible.The company has complained multiple times in the last two years about national laws in France, Germany and other countries directly to the commission, which is still considering those complaints. At the same time, the company has urged national courts whenever possible to ask the EU\u2019s top court whether national taxi rules can even apply under EU law to a technology platform like Uber.Tuesday\u2019s opinion was expected after the same court adviser, in a more advanced case also at the ECJ, in May said the U.S. ride-hailing company should be regulated as a transportation company, not an online platform as Uber had argued.If judges rule in line with Mr. Szpunar\u2019s recommendation that Uber be regulated as a transport service, it would effectively end Uber\u2019s long-fought legal attempt to lighten its heavy regulatory load across the continent. Regulators in Europe have sought to hold it to often strict rules and licensing requirements that apply to transportation companies, like taxi and traditional car-hire services.Pointing to that recommendation, Mr. Szpunar said Tuesday, if Uber doesn\u2019t constitute an IT service, it would therefore be unnecessary for any member state to notify the national rules to the commission.Judgments in both ECJ cases are expected later this year.Write to Natalia Drozdiak at natalia.drozdiak@wsj.com and Sam Schechner at sam.schechner@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-04 12:34:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/uber-suffers-setback-in-trying-to-quash-criminal-convictions-in-france-1499161999", "news_title": "Uber Suffers Setback in Trying to Quash Criminal Convictions in France", "keywords": " ecj, ecj recommendation in uber case, ecj uber case, french uber executives convicted, ridesharing, technology platform, uber, uber court case, uber court case in france, uber in europe, uber in france,uber lawsuit in europe,vc regulatory,Uber Technologies,European Court of Justice,corporate crime,legal action,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,transport,retail,wholesale,etailing,taxi,limousine service,e-commerce,internet,online,road,rail transport,technology,sharing economy services,transportation,logistics"}, {"content": "RIYADH\u2014Qatar Petroleum, the world\u2019s largest producer of liquefied natural gas, said Tuesday it plans to increase natural-gas output by 30% over the next seven years, as the small emirate faces a diplomatic crisis with its Persian Gulf neighbors.Qatar Petroleum will double the size of a major project in a massive subsea Persian Gulf gas field shared with Iran, Chief Executive       Saad al-Kaabi       said in a news conference in Doha on Tuesday. The expansion will bring Qatar\u2019s total LNG production to 100 million tons a year\u2014the equivalent of about 6 million barrels of oil\u2014from its current level of 77 million tons, he said.Qatar\u2019s decision was announced the same day that Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt said the tiny emirate had to respond to a list of demands. Those countries have cut diplomatic ties and imposed a transport ban against Qatar, accusing former allies in Doha of supporting extremist groups and meddling in their domestic affairs.Qatar denies the allegations.VIEW InteractiveQatar\u2019s economy has been resilient so far but could suffer deeply if the transport ban remains and other economic sanctions are imposed.

Qatar\u2019s move comes a day after Saudi Arabia\u2019s rival, Iran, said it was trying to increase its own output from the world\u2019s largest gas field, which it shares with Qatar.French energy giant             Total SA       said Monday it would invest $1 billion in a partnership to develop more gas from Iran\u2019s piece of the field, which Iran calls South Pars and Qatar calls the North Field.North Field output accounts for nearly all of Qatar\u2019s gas production and around 60% of its export revenue.Qatar declared a moratorium in 2005 on the development of the North Field, which it shares with Iran, to give Doha time to study the impact on the reservoir from a rapid rise in output.Qatar is also facing pressure from international competitors who are ramping up LNG output.Russia is developing its LNG capabilities, the U.S. has begun exporting the commodity, and big companies such as             Royal Dutch Shell                   PLC have made gas a strategic priority.If Qatar follows through with its plans to raise output, it would be sending more LNG into the global market at a time of oversupply, said Frank Harris, head of LNG consulting at energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie.\u201cWhichever way you look at it, it tends to suggest LNG prices going down, which isn\u2019t good for them,\u201d Mr. Harris said.\u201cToday\u2019s announcement looks like it\u2019s more about sending messages in the region rather than to the global LNG market,\u201d he added.\u2014Sarah McFarlane in London contributed to this articleWrite to Summer Said at summer.said@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-04 12:24:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/qatar-launches-plan-to-increase-lng-output-amid-arab-dispute-1499171146", "news_title": "Qatar Launches Plan to Increase LNG Output Amid Arab Dispute", "keywords": " gas, gas field, liquefied natural gas, lng, natural gas, persian gulf,qatar,Qatar Petroleum,plans,strategy,output,production,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,international relations,international sanctions,politics,domestic politics,regional politics,energy,crude oil,natural gas upstream operations,liquefied,compressed gas,natural gas,oil exploration"}, {"content": "Your editorial \u201cA Taxpayer Dike for Flood Insurance\u201d (June 24) serves to reinforce the misconception that the Federal Emergency Management Agency\u2019s flood insurance program protects mostly very wealthy homeowners who live by the shore in multimillion-dollar homes. The FEMA policies have a limit of $250,000 in value for the building and $100,000 for contents. An owner who wants more insurance for an expensive home must get it from a private insurance company.The vast majority of homes in St. Petersburg, Fla., in flood zones are owned not by millionaires but by retirees with limited income or middle-class working people with homes below the maximum of $250,000 for which FEMA would be responsible. The FEMA program likely needs some modifications, but not the drastic measures the government has undertaken. It would also be reassuring if the correct at-risk figures are used. Otherwise these premium hikes can be seen as a political effort to \u201cget the rich,\u201d not a policy supported by the facts on the ground.Robert SpiegelSt. Petersburg, Fla.During Katrina and Sandy, the dominant flood damage was in poor and working-class neighborhoods. When the Biggert-Waters 2012 flood-insurance bill was passed with an \u201cend the wealthy subsidy\u201d mentality, the results weren\u2019t what was expected. Many of the modest homes were hit with very high flood-insurance premiums\u2014as much as $40,000 a year. That led to the repeal in 2014 with Ms. Waters leading the charge. The flood-insurance program does need rational pricing and transparency. However, pricing should be based on future expected losses.

They will also be forced to publish data such as employment numbers, proving that they are not running shell companies.However, the European Parliament backed a compromise version of the proposal. It allowed authorities to grant exemptions in cases where providing the information would place the company at a disadvantage with its competitors.EU governments and the European Commission must still sign off on the proposals.The so-called country-by-country reporting was put forward by the EU\u2019s executive arm, the European Commission, in April 2016. It stipulates that companies with annual revenue of more than \u20ac750 million ($851 million) must publish a report on income and tax information accessible to the public.European countries have been trying to rein in corporate tax avoidance by multinational firms since the financial crisis, both by pushing to change international rules and by cracking down on companies that have struck alleged sweetheart deals in countries such as Luxembourg that allowed them to pay little tax in the EU.\u201cPublic country-by-country reporting will make it much harder for multinational corporations to shop around for the lowest possible tax rate, and help bring illegal activity to light,\u201d said German lawmaker       Sven Giegold       from the left-leaning Green party.Lawmakers agreed, however, to a \u201csafeguard clause\u201d that gives companies the option to apply for an annual exemption from reporting some of the detail on grounds of commercial sensitivity.

But these funds are increasingly looking for investments like private equity that can yield comparatively higher returns to satisfy the growing financial needs of their owners, notably in oil-exporting countries whose revenues have slumped with the drop in crude prices. Norway\u2019s wealth fund, the world\u2019s largest, said in April it was considering expanding its investment mandate to include private equity.ADIA receives its funding from the oil-rich Abu Dhabi government. In theory, the emirate can tap ADIA\u2019s financial resources to overcome any budgetary difficulties, but the fund said withdrawals have occurred rarely so far.The fund in recent years has expanded an internal unit focusing on private equity, staffed with regional and sector specialists. Despite the rising interest in emerging markets like India and China, recent transactions have taken place in more mature markets.ADIA was one of the largest investors in the acquisition of LeasePlan Corp in March 2016, and co-invested with MSD Partners to support Dell\u2019s $60 billion acquisition of EMC. The fund recently invested in U.S. pharmaceutical firm PPD.ADIA didn\u2019t disclose the value of its private-equity investments, though allocations to the asset class range from 2% to 8% of its long-term portfolio, in which developed equities account for about a third of total exposure, it said.The Abu Dhabi fund made 20-year annualized returns of 6.1% at the end of 2016 compared with 6.5% the previous year. Its 30-year annualized returns also declined to 6.9% at the end of last year compared with 7.5% at the end of 2015. ADIA said the numbers reflected the exclusion of high returns from the mid-1980s and 1990s from the rolling averages.\u201cWhen viewed as a whole, ADIA ended 2016 on a positive note, with performance underpinned by respectable gains in global markets despite considerable headwinds from political events throughout the year,\u201d       Hamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan,        the fund\u2019s managing director, said in the report.Referring to some of the political surprises last year such as the U.K.\u2019s vote to leave the European Union and the election of       Donald Trump       as U.S. president, Mr. Al Nahyan said that traditional political, policy and economic factors are set to look significantly different in the next 10 years.\u201cOne of the strongest sentiments coming out of 2016 is that the world is changing,\u201d he said. Even the most important political changes weren\u2019t entirely unexpected, he said. \u201cThey were the result of pressures that had been building for some time, and that are likely to persist.\u201dADIA reiterated that future economic growth will be generated by the emerging economies, especially China and India. ADIA in 2016 opened an office in Hong Kong, underlining the fund\u2019s growing interest in China and the rest of Asia.\u201cA key challenge for ADIA and other global investors is how to access this growth, and we welcome efforts in many of these countries to improve the openness and functioning of capital markets,\u201d he said.Despite its increasing focus on these emerging markets, ADIA\u2019s long-term portfolio is still concentrated on North America, Europe and equities in more developed markets. ADIA\u2019s investment strategies are closely watched around the globe as even a small shift by a fund of this size could move asset prices. It kept target asset-allocations unchanged last year, the fund said.ADIA was founded in 1976 but has released annual reports only since 2009 as part of a broader move by sovereign funds to improve disclosure. The fund had around 1,750 employees from more than 60 countries at the end of 2016, according to the review, up from 1,700 the previous year.Write to Nicolas Parasie at nicolas.parasie@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-04 11:13:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/abu-dhabi-wealth-funds-appetite-for-private-equity-grows-as-returns-slip-1499181230", "news_title": "Abu Dhabi Wealth Fund\u2019s Appetite for Private Equity Grows as Returns Slip", "keywords": " abu dhabi, hunt for yield, investment strategy, oil prices, private equity, private-equity returns,sovereign wealth fund, sovereign wealth funds, swfs,u.a.e.,Abu Dhabi Investment Authority,corporate,industrial news,asset allocation,political,general news,personal finance,trusts,funds,financial vehicles,private equity,financial investments,portfolio,fund,asset management,alternative investments,financial services,investing,securities"}, {"content": "Two New York investors have teamed up to overturn the \u201cmerger of equals\u201d planned between chemical companies Huntsman and             Clariant        CLZNY -1.56%      \u2014but they face a protracted battle for shareholder votes and minds with Clariant\u2019s strong-willed chief executive, Hariolf Kottmann.40 North, the investment arm of privately held Standard Industries, and activist investor Corvex, run by       Carl Icahn       prot\u00e9g\u00e9       Keith Meister,        have built a $550 million joint stake in Clariant.

What happened next proved sobering for other cities in the same pickle. Hundreds of police officers quit. Response times for serious calls rose.Faced with labor-union litigation, San Jose this year restored previous retirement ages and cost-of-living increases for existing police officers, and last month it gave them a raise.Police pensions are among the worst-funded in the nation. Retirement systems for police and firefighters have just a median 71 cents for every dollar needed to cover future liabilities, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of data provided by Merritt Research Services for cities of 30,000 or more.The combined shortfall in the plans, which are the responsibility of municipal governments, is more than $80 billion, nearly equal to New York City\u2019s annual budget.Broader municipal pension plans have a median 78 cents of every dollar needed to cover future liabilities, according to data from Merritt. The 100 largest U.S. corporate pension plans have 85% of assets needed on hand, according to Milliman Inc. data as of March 31.And yet any attempt to bring police pensions into line with today\u2019s municipal budgets and stock-market performance runs into the reality that many officers won\u2019t stand for it\u2014and they often have the public behind them.\u201cThey have extra clout because people love police,\u201d said Dallas Mayor       Mike Rawlings.       \u201cI love police. You love police. An electrician\u2014you don\u2019t have that emotional tie.\u201dHis city, like San Jose, found itself facing widespread police-officer resignations when it moved to cut their pensions. In Dallas, the situation became so difficult the state legislature stepped in this spring to work out a solution.Police pensions were the first nonmilitary retirement systems to be created in the U.S., in second half of the 19th century. In later years, when municipal budgets were tight, augmenting pension promises in lieu of raises became a way governments could make peace with politically powerful police unions without incurring immediate new spending.In the 1980s and 1990s, robust investment returns made governments\u2019 pension promises look affordable. By 2001, major police and firefighter plans followed by the Public Plans Database, which tracks 150 major state and local pension plans, had a median 101% of what they needed to pay for future obligations.The 2008 financial crisis wiped out pension-plan earnings at the same time that it put stress on municipal budgets, leading some cities to contribute less to the plans each year than what actuaries calculated was needed.Also, many cities continued to assume robust 1990s-era investment returns when they calculated annual pension contributions. Their pension debt grew as those returns failed to materialize and cities didn\u2019t adjust their contributions to the plans.Memphis, Tenn., gambled it could cut police pensions without any impact on public safety. The city council voted in 2014 to end pensions for municipal workers, including the police, with 7.5 years of service or less, and replace the pensions with a hybrid plan combining pension and 401(k)-style benefits.In the following two years, about 100 officers affected by the changes left the force, out of a total of about 2,000. Homicides rose to a record 228 last year from 167 in 2014. Billboards erected by the police union around town read, \u201cWelcome to Memphis: 228 homicides in 2016, down over 500 police officers.\u201d Memphis currently has 1,928 officers, down from 2,416 in 2012.The city\u2019s mayor,       Jim Strickland,        has since pledged to increase police staffing. A spokeswoman for the city said enrollment in the police academy is increasing despite the reduced benefits package. Even so, city officials recently announced a $6.1 million grant for retention bonuses. Meanwhile, the police union is trying to get certain benefits restored in court.One of the first cities that tried to bring police pension costs down was San Jose, where former Mayor       Chuck Reed       asked voters to approve pension cuts as part of a 2012 ballot measure.Among the hundreds of police officers who quit after voters said yes to the change was       Tim Watermulder,        who left to join the Oakland police department in 2013. It had been announced that the police-academy class in which he graduated would be the first to operate under a new system providing lower cost-of-living increases and a retirement age of 60 instead of 50.\u201cYou start to see what police work is really like every day,\u201d said Mr. Watermulder, 35 years old, who fought in Iraq with the U.S. military before becoming a police officer. \u201cI really started thinking about \u2018Can I do this job till I\u2019m 60?\u2019\u201dAbout 180 of 1,109 sworn officer positions in San Jose are currently vacant. San Jose has the lowest number of officers per capita among the nation\u2019s 35 largest cities, according to a Journal analysis of Federal Bureau of Investigation data from 2015, the most recent available.Response times for the most serious calls rose to an average of 7.3 minutes last year from 6.1 minutes in fiscal 2011, according to the police department.Response times vs. targetsNumber of officers20 minutes1,500 officersPriority 2\u2020Pension changeapproved", "news_time": "2017-07-04 10:59:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/ill-funded-police-pensions-put-cities-in-a-bind-1499180342", "news_title": "Ill-Funded Police Pensions Put Cities in a Bind", "keywords": "city budgets,dallas,memphis,muncipal budgets,pensions,police,police pensions,san jose,texas pension law,Merritt Research Services,Public Plans Database,S&P Global Ratings,Milliman,University of Missouri-St. Louis,political,general news,national,public security,crime,legal action,law enforcement,personal finance,politics,international relations,domestic politics,regional politics,retirement planning"}, {"content": "New Jersey state parks and other services reopened on the Fourth of July after the governor and legislature reached a last-minute budget deal.State-run beaches were jammed, officials said, but some activities were moved and a 5k race planned for Liberty Island was called off.\u201cIt was a little reminiscent of the parks reopening after superstorm Sandy, where people rediscovered our state parks. They\u2019re just happy to be back,\u201d said Bob Considine, New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection spokesman.Jersey City relocated its July Fourth festival and fireworks from Liberty State Park to Exchange Place because of the shutdown. Even though the parks reopened, the city kept the festivities at Exchange Place because it was too late to switch again.Special Olympics New Jersey called off the Statue of Liberty 5k because of uncertainty over the shutdown, according to the organization\u2019s website. Participants were to check in and take the ferry from Liberty State Park in Jersey City to Liberty Island.Meanwhile, in Trenton, Democrats emerged from the weekend\u2019s bitter budget battle with Gov. Chris Christie with a rare win: More than $300 million in additional spending from a Republican governor known to use his veto pen.Mr. Christie had threatened to use his line-item veto power to cut the extra funding from the final budget unless lawmakers approved legislation that gave the state more oversight over New Jersey\u2019s largest insurer. Unwilling to part with the additional funding, Democratic legislators refused to send the governor the budget, which prompted a three-day government shutdown.The impasse ended late Monday night when Democrats and Mr. Christie agreed to a watered-down version of the legislation originally sought by the governor, who then signed the $34.7 billion budget with the additional spending intact.\u201cI\u2019m sorry for the inconvenience that everyone went through, but at the end of the day we had one hell of a budget that we can be proud of,\u201d said Senate President Steve Sweeney, a Democrat. \u201cIt\u2019s the best budget we\u2019ve seen in 10 years.\u201dThe final budget agreement includes $100 million in new spending for underfunded schools, $25 million to expand state-funded preschool, $13 million in family-planning and other women\u2019s services programs, as well as money for other social-service programs.In previous budgets, Mr. Christie slashed proposed spending from Democrats that would have increased the state\u2019s pension payments, expanded the earned-income tax credit and funded family-planning programs.\u201cAt the end of the day this budget has a lot of really great things in it, a lot of Democratic priorities,\u201d Assembly Speaker Vincent Prieto said Monday.Lawmakers missed Friday\u2019s deadline to approve a balanced budget, prompting the shutdown that closed state parks and beaches and furloughed more than 30,000 state workers on Monday.The Republican governor, who faced an onslaught of criticism after he was photographed on a state beach that was closed to the public during the shutdown, received less than he initially sought with regard to the insurer, Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey. But he hailed Monday\u2019s agreement as \u201coverdue, significant reform\u201d of the not-for-profit, which covers 3.8 million people.The governor first targeted the insurer in his February budget address, when he called on it to provide funding for a new state addiction-treatment fund. When Horizon resisted, he proposed legislation that would give the state wide-ranging control over its finances, while expanding transparency on executive and lobbyist pay and adding four new state-appointed members to its board.Horizon had strongly opposed Mr. Christie\u2019s original proposals, which executives said would make the insurer less competitive and possibly force them to raise premiums.The bill agreed to on Monday caps the insurer\u2019s reserves at 725% of risk-based capital with the understanding that excess funds would be used to benefit policyholders.The legislation also requires Horizon to publicly post detailed financial statements, including executive pay, and provides for the appointment of two new public board members.Horizon Chief Executive Robert Marino, who met privately with lawmakers in Trenton on Monday, said in a statement that he supported the final deal.\u201cHorizon could only agree to legislation that is reasonable, avoids higher costs for our members, and that does not impose unfair or excessive obligations,\u201d he said.Mr. Christie, who is prevented by term limits from running for a third term, is scheduled to leave office in January.Write to Kate King at Kate.King@wsj.com and Keiko Morris at Keiko.Morris@wsj.comAppeared in the July 5, 2017, print edition as 'Services Revived As Budget Deal Reached in N.J..'", "news_time": "2017-07-04 10:48:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-jersey-budget-deal-poised-to-end-standoff-between-legislature-and-gov-chris-christie-1499144634", "news_title": "New Jersey Services Restored After Budget Deal Sealed   ", "keywords": "chris christie,chris christie budget,horizon blue cross blue shield of new jersey,new jersey budget,new jersey politics,Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey,Chris Christie,capacity,facilities,corporate,industrial news,facility closures,government finance,government budget,taxation,sub-national,local budget,economic news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,insurance,non-life insurance,health,medical insurance,financial services,health maintenance organizations,private health insurance"}, {"content": "REHOBOTH BEACH, Del.\u2014Capt. Kent Buckson\u2019s radio crackled with word of a situation on the beach. A lifeguard had spotted a large canopy amid the sea of umbrellas. That meant one thing. Time for a takedown.\u201cWe\u2019ve got to get to that one,\u201d said Mr. Buckson, the soft-spoken beach patrol boss. He and his deputy,       Aaron Tartal,        jumped into an all-terrain vehicle and headed over. Mr. Tartal, shirtless and in red swim trunks, strode over to the canopy owner.\u201cGood morning, sir. I\u2019ve got bad news,\u201d Mr. Tartal told the man. Then he laid out the new law on the two-mile beach. No tents or canopies allowed, except baby tents up to 3 feet high, wide or deep.\u201cFreakin\u2019 ridiculous,\u201d groused the man, who declined to give his name, as he dismantled the black 8-by-10-foot canopy he had just erected.\u201cNew city ordinance, it\u2019s a little bit of a learning curve,\u201d Mr. Tartal gamely replied, pointing out the nearby shacks that rent umbrellas for $12 a day.Rehoboth Beach is part of a wave of seaside communities that have embraced umbrella-only policies. Myrtle Beach, S.C., enacted such a law four years ago. This summer, Sunset Beach, N.C., and Seaside Heights, N.J., both rolled out regulations restricting sun shields in some places.Myrtle Beach\u2019s advice to Rehoboth Beach: Hang in there. \u201cThe first year was fairly rocky,\u201d spokesman Mark Kruea said. \u201cPeople are accustomed to having that tent.\u201d While the South Carolina resort sometimes cites people for wearing overly skimpy swimsuits, he couldn\u2019t recall anyone being ticketed for violating the canopy law.Since May 27, the Rehoboth beach patrol says, lifeguards have blown the whistle on canopies and tents about 840 times\u2014\u201ctakedowns,\u201d Mr. Buckson calls them. Lifeguards can call police if a violator doesn\u2019t comply, though police have issued just three $25 tickets, according to Rehoboth Beach Police Chief Keith Banks.For the 65 lifeguards, many of them college age, it has been a different kind of educational experience. Their diplomacy skills are tested as front-line enforcers of a law that can pull unsuspecting beachgoers into an undertow of anger and disbelief.\u201cWe keep it short and simple,\u201d said 21-year-old lifeguard       Ryan Crowley.       \u201cCaptain B. doesn\u2019t want us getting into altercations.\u201d Some people already were giving them lip for enforcing bans on smoking, drinking and kite-flying, he said.Fans view the law as a fair way to improve the beach experience. Critics throw shade, calling it a pointless hassle and questioning why a cluster of umbrellas is OK if open-sided canopies aren\u2019t. Some wonder if the aim is to boost umbrella rentals. (It isn\u2019t, officials say.)\u201cIt\u2019s definitely a hot potato,\u201d said Mr. Buckson, 50 years old, who has led the beach patrol for 18 years and also is a special-education teacher. His voice rose at one point during an interview, prompting him to say, \u201cIt\u2019s stressful, as you can maybe tell from my voice.\u201dRehoboth Beach officials say public safety and aesthetics drove the change. Large, \u201cnontraditional shading devices\u201d had mushroomed in recent years, making it harder for lifeguards to see the beach and water while impeding access to the ocean, they say. Some people used the fabric walls to hide smoking or alcohol consumption.Officials say single-pole umbrellas pose less of a navigational challenge for lifeguards and first-responders than canopies or tents with multiple poles and in some cases tethers.Another concern: High wind could turn poorly anchored tents and canopies into airborne projectiles, though Mr. Banks acknowledged umbrellas present a similar risk.Dozens of visitors and residents had complained about tents and canopies to the local Chamber of Commerce, said its chief executive,       Carol Everhart,        who notified the town. She said public support for the law seems strong.\u201cLove, love, love it,\u201d said regular visitor       Lynn Degenhart       as she sat on the beach with her husband, Karl. The beach is now much less cluttered, she said. She used a baby tent to shade their cooler.At a gathering one morning, Mr. Buckson doled out reminders to his lifeguards. Drink lots of water. Don\u2019t let anyone dig deep holes. Enforce the canopy law.\u201cJust remember, if you see the pop-up tents or canopies, approach the people politely\u201d and \u201cask them please take them down within the next 15 minutes,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to be too happy about it.\u201dThe first takedown fell to 19-year-old Christian Cosden. The offenders were Justin and       Sara Slomkowski       of Philadelphia, whose umbrella had a swatch of fabric extending down to the sand to shade their 16-month-old, Nora.Mr. Cosden, shirtless and barefoot, explained that umbrellas with sides aren\u2019t allowed. \u201cSo if you can take the sides off, that\u2019d be awesome,\u201d he said.\u201cSure,\u201d said Mr. Slomkowski.\u201cCool. Thank you, guys.\u201dAsked about it, Mr. Slomkowski said it was \u201ckind of silly\u201d they had to yank the side off. His wife bought the umbrella after reading about the law online and thought it complied. They weren\u2019t going to make waves. \u201cWe\u2019re just here on vacation for a couple days,\u201d he said.Mr. Cosden said most interactions are similarly smooth, but some scofflaws tell him to go pound sand. \u201cThey just won\u2019t take it down, they just won\u2019t even talk to you or look at you, or they\u2019ll walk away,\u201d he said. Those he lets the police handle.That morning, the beach patrol\u2019s Mr. Tartal broke it to       John Haas       of Silver Spring, Md., that his blue tent\u2014at that moment shading his wife, their toddler twins and his niece\u2014exceeded the 3-foot limit. Mr. Haas took the news well and even laughed about being busted. An assistant principal at a high school, he knows about rule-following.Moments later, the 25-year-old Mr. Tartal, who is a lifeguard in addition to Capt. Buckson\u2019s beach patrol deputy, told       Marjorie Danko,        a receptionist from Hershey, Pa., that the $40 three-sided tent she bought for her grandchildren didn\u2019t pass muster, either.\u201cI don\u2019t understand this,\u201d she said. \u201cI think umbrellas are much more dangerous. What kind of ordinance is that? I mean, really dumb.\u201dMr. Tartal apologized but didn\u2019t debate her. \u201cWe don\u2019t write the ordinances,\u201d he said, \u201cwe just enforce them.\u201dClutching some cash, Ms. Danko marched off to go rent an umbrella.Appeared in the July 5, 2017, print edition as 'Beach Patrol Draws a Line In the Sand: No More Tents.'", "news_time": "2017-07-04 10:40:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/beach-patrol-confronts-a-new-menace-oversize-tents-1499179201", "news_title": "Beach Patrol Confronts a New Menace:  Oversize Tents\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t", "keywords": "beaches,beach tents,beach umbrellas,lifeguards,myrtle beach,rehoboth beach,sunbathing,aquatics,water sports,political,general news,living,lifestyle,sports,recreation,swimming,routine general news"}, {"content": "A flood of incorrect stock-market data briefly hit traders\u2019 screens around the globe early Tuesday morning in Asia, showing apparent huge moves in the             Nasdaq        NDAQ 0.15%      -listed share prices of some of the world\u2019s biggest companies, including tech giants             Apple Inc.,        AAPL 0.63%Microsoft Corp.        MSFT 0.76%       and             Amazon.com Inc.        AMZN 0.24%The faulty data on stock prices appeared on several platforms including Yahoo Finance, Google Finance and on Bloomberg terminals between 6 a.m. and 7 a.m. Hong Kong time, after U.S. markets Monday had closed early ahead of the Independence Day holiday.As a result of the glitch, several stocks briefly showed their price to be $123.47\u2014equivalent to a 14% drop in Apple\u2019s shares, an 87% plunge for Amazon and a 79% surge for Microsoft.Joe Christinat,        a Nasdaq spokesman, said no actual trades were affected by the glitch. Both normal trading and so-called after-markets trading, when investors can continue to trade via the exchange for a further four hours, had ended for the day on Nasdaq by the time the wrong data appeared.If the stock price moves had actually occurred, it would have knocked $104 billion off the market value of Apple, the world\u2019s most valuable stock. Amazon\u2019s market cap would have dropped $396 billion, while Microsoft\u2019s would have risen $415 billion.The appearance of the incorrect data sparked disagreement over who was to blame. A spokesman for Nasdaq said the problem was caused by test data being improperly disseminated by third-party vendors including Bloomberg.However, a person familiar with one of the vendors said Nasdaq had changed its testing protocols but had not informed vendors ahead of time. Nasdaq said it had sent out a standard alert to the market on June 26 with the schedule for its data feeds for the early close on July 3.A story that appeared early on Bloomberg\u2019s website Tuesday initially said a Nasdaq error had caused the faulty data. The story was later corrected to remove the reference to the Nasdaq error.\u201cThis is a vendor issue, not a Nasdaq issue,\u201d said Nasdaq\u2019s Mr. Christinat, saying that others such as FactSet and even Nasdaq.com showed correct pricing data. That difference suggested that the faulty data issue was more the responsibility of some data providers.In an emailed statement, a Google representative said, \u201cWe can confirm that our third-party finance data partner was providing some inaccurate information, which they received from Nasdaq.\u201d\u201cThis is currently being fixed and we hope to update our stock price data shortly,\u201d Google said. According to the company\u2019s website, the closing prices on Google Finance are provided by SIX Financial Information and its intraday pricing data are provided by Interactive Data Real-Time Services. However, Google declined to confirm that those companies provide data to Google Finance.A representative for SIX said its data feed wasn\u2019t the problem.\u201cWe checked our data and it was correct,\u201d the representative said. \u201cNo incorrect prices came from us.\u201dApple, Amazon and Microsoft didn\u2019t respond immediately to requests for comment.Stock markets in the U.S. were open for only a half-day session Monday and will be closed Tuesday in observance of Independence Day. Aftermarket hours on Nasdaq, during which shares trade following the close of the regular session, usually last for four hours. The market typically closes at 4 p.m. ET.\u2018This is a vendor issue, not a Nasdaq issue.\u2019Nasdaq\u2019s Mr. Christinat said Monday\u2019s early close at 1 p.m. ET might have played a role in the confusion that prompted the improper use and dissemination of test data, which he said is sent out after every trading day.\u201cI\u2019ve seen quite a few \u2018fat-finger\u2019 incidents when you get a funny price briefly,\u201d said Eric Moffett, a portfolio manager for the T. Rowe Price Asia Opportunities Equity Fund in Hong Kong. \u201cWhen I saw the series of alerts, I figured something was up.\u201dMr. Moffett said he takes a long-term view on the stocks his fund invests in, so any sharp moves in the market\u2014whether from a fat finger or not\u2014likely won\u2019t prompt any significant trading activity. Even so, he said the flurry of alerts related to the pricing issues caught his attention.\u201cI immediately wondered with something like this if there was some sort of cyberattack,\u201d Mr. Moffett said.Mr. Christinat at Nasdaq said he didn\u2019t see any evidence of a hack or a cyberattack affecting the erroneous pricing.Several high-profile trading glitches have roiled markets in recent years. In August 2013, a technical glitch knocked out trading in all Nasdaq Stock Market securities for three hours due to a problem with the data feed that supplied trade information. In July 2015, a glitch forced the New York Stock Exchange to halt trading for nearly four hours.Meanwhile, in May 2010, the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged nearly 1000 points in a matter of minutes before rebounding quickly in what widely became known as the \u201cflash crash.\u201dThe difference this time is that no trades appear to have been affected by the latest fiasco. A trader notice from Nasdaq said \u201ccertain third parties improperly propagated test data that was distributed as part of the normal evening test procedures.\u201d The notice added: \u201cAll production data was completed by 5:16 p.m. ET as expected per the early close of the markets. Any data messages received post 5:16 p.m. should be deemed as test data and purged from direct data recipient\u2019s databases.\u201dA system status message posted on Nasdaq\u2019s website said \u201csystems are operating normally.\u201d However, not all stock quotes appeared to be accurate. Shares in Nasdaq-listed biotech giant             Amgen Inc.       were still being incorrectly shown down 28% at $123.45 on Google Finance by late evening Asia time.

And the problems go well beyond ESPN.The sports network\u2019s struggle to adapt to a rapidly changing media landscape has garnered much of the attention from investors and analysts. Meanwhile, Nielsen data show ratings have fallen significantly at Disney\u2019s biggest brands reaching children, teens and young adults, led by Disney Channel and Freeform.Each of those two channels has lost about four million subscribers over the past three years, bringing them to about 90 million apiece, according to SNL Kagan, an industry consulting firm.The troubles are twofold: a lack of hits and the broader move by audiences away from traditional television to digital alternatives. The shift to streaming services such as Netflix Inc. and web-based platforms like Google\u2019s YouTube is particularly pronounced among younger viewers targeted by these Disney networks.Other cable-programming giants are facing similar challenges. But the rising cost of sports content combined with younger viewers watching less traditional TV is particularly worrisome for Disney\u2019s cable holdings. According to Nielsen, among people ages 2 through 34, prime-time viewing has dropped by 34% in the past five years.Disney Channel executives said they are trying to improve programming and determine how aggressively to make the leap to mobile and online formats.\u201cWe see the migration,\u201d said Disney Channel President       Gary Marsh.       \u201cOne of the challenges is trying to serve the viewership where they\u2019re going as opposed to trying to drive them where we want them to go.\u201dDisney Channel programming is focused on children, while Freeform, which changed its name from ABC Family in January 2016, is aimed at teenagers and young adults.Cable TV has long been Disney\u2019s biggest business, accounting for 30% of its revenue and 43% of profits last fiscal year, according to the company. About 26% of cable revenue and profits come from entertainment networks like Disney Channel and Freeform, Morgan Stanley estimates, while the rest is generated by ESPN. Disney doesn\u2019t disclose the breakdown.Even though Disney Channel is considered a relatively costly channel for cable companies, it doesn\u2019t command the large subscription fees that ESPN does.Also at stake for Disney is the exposure its TV channels offer for toys, clothes and other products that the company relies on for hundreds of millions of dollars annually in revenue.As consumers \u201ccut the cord,\u201d Disney\u2019s once fast-growing cable business has slowed down. According to the company, cable revenue was flat and operating income was down 6% in the first half of the current fiscal year. That has alarmed Wall Street.Disney Chief Executive       Robert Iger       has said that strengthening online accessibility for television programs is a priority and that the company is preparing to offer its channels, in part or whole, directly to consumers online rather than just through costly cable television packages.Profits for Disney Channel and Freeform are driven in part by long-term contracts with cable companies, but the erosion in ratings is likely to ultimately hit the bottom line unless the networks can generate substantial new digital revenue.Both channels are considering when, not whether, to launch direct-to-consumer apps, similar to Time Warner Inc.\u2019s HBO Now.\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt in my mind that the company will pursue that,\u201d said Mr. Marsh, adding that such an option could be unveiled in the near future.For the first six months of this year, the commercial-free Disney Channel\u2019s ratings among its core 2-11 year old and 6-14 year old demographics fell 23% in prime time and 13% and 18%, respectively, during the full day, compared with the same period a year earlier, according to Nielsen. Ratings are also down at the smaller Disney Jr. and Disney XD networks, which fall under Mr. Marsh\u2019s Disney Channel umbrella.Making the transition to online and mobile platforms is a delicate dance. Distributors like             Comcast Corp.       and             AT&T Inc.\u2019s       DirecTV pay high subscription fees that currently account for a large chunk of the Disney networks\u2019 profits. Distributors have said they are wary of too much content being available outside of the pay-TV ecosystem.Online video currently carries fewer ads and generates significantly less revenue than network programming, particularly if it is available to people who don\u2019t subscribe to cable.Freeform President Tom Ascheim said digital viewing for the channel has doubled in the past two years as his network has put its shows online, including full seasons of popular programs like \u201cFamous in Love.\u201dSuch a strategy could mean a short-term hit to ratings and revenue. Still, Mr. Ascheim said, \u201cWhen we look out a bunch of years from now, digital gets bigger than linear. That feels real clear.\u201dOn the Disney Channel, some new shows, such as \u201cI Didn\u2019t Do It\u201d and \u201cBest Friends Whenever,\u201d didn\u2019t click with children, which contributed to the ratings decline.\u201cWe haven\u2019t had the breakout hits in the last year or so,\u201d Mr. Marsh said.Disney Channel is betting on \u201cRaven\u2019s Home,\u201d a spinoff of its hit \u201cThat\u2019s So Raven.\u201d It also has a sequel to its smash original movie \u201cDescendants.\u201dCanceled shows on Freeform include the dramas \u201cGuilt\u201d and \u201cDead of Summer,\u201d which both were darker than the network\u2019s \u201cPretty Little Liars\u201d and \u201cFamous in Love.\u201dFreeform\u2019s prime-time viewership among people ages 12-17 was down 25% from January through June, according to Nielsen. For the 18-34 year old demographic, the drop was 20% over the same period.Both Freeform and Disney Channel are confident that their new slate of shows will lift ratings. Freeform is now targeting young men along with women. Next season, it plans to debut \u201cCloak and Dagger,\u201d its first show from sister unit Marvel.

It is the relatively obscure business of payments technology and infrastructure that may have       Jamie Dimon\u2019s       animal spirits flowing.The U.S. banking giant has made an early approach for U.K.-based             Worldpay,        WPG -0.95%       the target company said on Tuesday. And J.P. Morgan isn\u2019t alone: one of the U.S.\u2019s leading payments companies,             Vantiv,        VNTV 0.63%       has also made a separate early approach, Worldpay added.There were no details about what value either approach might put on Worldpay, or whether offers might be made in cash or stock, but under U.K. takeover rules both potential bidders now face a deadline of Aug. 1 by when they must either announce a firm intention to make an offer or walk away for six months. Worldpay\u2019s shares rose by more than a quarter on the news, sending its market capitalization to over $10 billion, indicating a chunky deal for the banking world, where activity has been scarce since the financial crisis.Just this weekend, Danish payments group Nets, also said it had received an early takeover approach. It provided no details, though analysts thought             Visa                   or             Mastercard                   could be interested.The payments sector has been a hive of activity in recent years and is seen as ripe for consolidation. Companies like Worldpay are investing heavily in new technology to help retailers take money from customers online and in the real world via cards, mobile phones or other devices. Most conspicuously, these includes the card terminals consumers see at checkout counters.But while e-commerce and the use of debit and credit cards in stores continues to grow, Worldpay\u2019s revenue growth disappointed in some areas last year, particularly in the U.S. where technical problems slowed the deployment of new physical terminals for retailers.One problem is that for all the excitement around new systems for retailers, the industry faces a major threat, especially in Europe. The payments market is about to be opened up to new competitors, known as Payment Initiation Service Providers, which will be able to entirely bypass the current pipework which links together banks, card networks, such as Visa and Mastercard, and payment acquirers such as Worldpay.This is the route through which all payments currently run, including those made via mobile phones or other apparently new forms of payment. The new payments competitors will be able to enact a direct\u2014typically free\u2014transfer from one bank account to another.The existing pipework currently collects revenues as a tiny percentage of the value of each card payment, which is split between a bank, the card network and the acquirer. In the U.K. that is 0.68% of every debit card transaction, according to consultants at             Accenture.       A competitor that bypasses this setup could charge much less.J.P. Morgan is part of that pipework and acquiring another section of the pipe could defend it against competition. When all these payment players face challenged revenues, it is no wonder that they are eyeing each other up.Mr. Dimon hasn\u2019t done a major deal since the financial crisis, when the bank acquired             Washington Mutual                   and Bear Stearns, both aided by government bailouts. With little deal making since then, it has announced stock buybacks worth close to $60 billion. Now it may finally be finding a better use for its cash.Write to Paul J.

Instead, the leadership may settle on less-drastic measures such as giving the central bank a bigger say in coordinating with other regulators, according to the people.\u201cIt\u2019s stability first and foremost,\u201d one of the people said. \u201cThe goal is to improve regulatory coordination.\u201dPresident Xi Jinping ordered a plan for creating more coherent financial oversight in late 2015, following regulatory missteps that exacerbated market turmoil and put in question Beijing\u2019s ability to manage the economy. That resulted in hopes within China\u2019s financial circles for a more empowered central bank, a step other countries have taken in times of heightened risks.But a consolidation of regulatory power into the PBOC would require some powerful groups to cede turf, officials involved in the process say. As a result, the final plan is expected to be less radical while still seeking to elevate the central bank\u2019s role. One option being discussed is the creation of a separate group within the PBOC to oversee coordination with the banking, securities and insurance regulators, the people said.A lack of consensus on the regulatory overhaul had caused the leadership to put off the key policy meeting, originally expected late last year or early this year. The first financial work conference, held in November 1997, at the time of the Asian financial crisis, resulted in the birth of four major state-owned asset-management companies in charge of handling bad assets from the nation\u2019s big banks. The most recent one, in January 2012, paved the way for a faster pace of financial liberalization in the following years.The conference will take place as Beijing tries to keep the economy on an even keel ahead of a major power reshuffle later this year. In recent months, Mr. Xi has replaced most of his economic team, including the finance minister and the top banking regulator; questions remain on who will succeed Zhou Xiaochuan, the central-bank governor, who is expected to retire this year.Of particular concern to the leadership is new risk that has sprung up precisely because of an onslaught of regulatory measures to curb runaway debt levels. Moves such as raising the cost of short-term funds have left companies scrambling for cash.Most recently, China\u2019s banking regulator has ordered sweeping checks on the borrowings of some of the country\u2019s top overseas deal makers, including Anbang Insurance Group Co., HNA Group Co. and Dalian Wanda Group. Those moves have rippled through the country\u2019s stock and bond markets.The market turbulence, some officials and economists say, highlights the importance of better coordination of regulation and of preventing regulators from competing among each other.Write to Lingling Wei at lingling.wei@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-04 09:03:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-to-hold-high-level-meeting-aimed-at-streamlining-financial-regulation-1499173423", "news_title": "China to Hold High-Level Meeting Aimed at Streamlining Financial Regulation ", "keywords": "fianncial regulation,finreg,pboc,people's bank of china,Anbang Insurance Group,People's Bank of China,HNA Holding Group,HK:0521,Dalian Wanda Group, Xi Jinping, Zhou Xiaochuan,regulation,government policy,conferences,exhibitions,corporate,industrial news,economic news,banking,central banking,insurance,credit,financial services"}, {"content": "BEIJING\u2014The world\u2019s biggest online gaming company,             Tencent Holdings Ltd.        TCEHY 3.69%      , is running into problems at home in China as debate rages over how long children play its popular games, the latest imbroglio facing the nation\u2019s internet giants amid greater official scrutiny.Tencent on Tuesday unveiled a new system that limits the time children play its top-grossing mobile game, Honor of Kings, saying on social media that it was taking the lead to roll out policies to prevent gaming addiction. The issue of youngsters playing games has drawn the attention of media and officials after being linked to a spate of suicides and crimes.Yet state media continued to criticize the company\u2019s hit game, which had 50 million daily active users at the end of last year, according to gaming consultancy Niko Partners, and the effect it was having on society. The controversy sent a chill through investors, with the company\u2019s stock tumbling 4.1% on Tuesday, dragging down Hong Kong\u2019s stock index on which it is the largest constituent.Analysts warned the limitations on play time will have a negative impact on Tencent, one of Asia\u2019s biggest public companies, which pulls in about 30% of its revenues from mobile gaming.A big chunk of this revenue comes from players under the age of 18, said China Merchants Securities analyst Richard Ko. Players can play up to certain levels for free, but then must pay to continue to more advanced levels. Mr. Ko estimates the limitations will lower Honor of Kings revenues by 5% for the year, impacting Tencent\u2019s overall mobile gaming top line by 1.6%.Tencent didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment.The incident is the latest in a slew affecting China\u2019s biggest tech companies, as Beijing increasingly steps up monitoring and policing of their platforms to ensure they don\u2019t violate official social policies.For Tencent, which also operates China\u2019s largest social media platform WeChat, and owns other game makers including Supercell Oy of Finland and Riot Games Inc. in its portfolio, the stakes are high as the company is used on a regular basis by the majority of Chinese internet users.\u201cIt\u2019s important for Tencent to show their social responsibility,\u201d said Kitty Fok, managing director at research firm IDC, who hailed the decision. \u201cThey\u2019re big enough.\u201dUnder the new system, children age 12 and under are limited to one hour a day of play before 9 p.m. and children aged 12 to 18 to two hours a day.The new system builds on platform Tencent unveiled this spring that connects children\u2019s gaming accounts with their parents\u2019 accounts, so they can monitor their children\u2019s play. The parental oversight platform has nearly 700,000 accounts linked, and a recent upgrade now allows parents to stop all accounts from being played on specific devices.Despite Tencent\u2019s initiatives, China\u2019s state-run newspapers, which often serve as the Communist Party\u2019s mouthpiece, came down hard on the company.\u201cWhen making money and hurting people coexist, we need to be more alarmed,\u201d said People\u2019s Daily.An opinion piece by Xinhua News Agency said the game \u201cweakens the kids\u2019 self control and worsens their tempers,\u201d adding that some children had even stolen their parents\u2019 bank cards in order to keep playing the game.Inside the company, some younger employees who spent time developing and coding the popular game felt it was unfair to be blamed for making the game so successful, according to a Tencent employee familiar with the situation.\u201cIt\u2019s not only about the game,\u201d the employee said. \u201cIt\u2019s an issue about undertaking social responsibility and the borders between private enterprises and the government, and how much the government should do and how much we should do.\u201d\u2014Fanfan Wang contributed to this articleWrite to Alyssa Abkowitz at alyssa.abkowitz@wsj.comAppeared in the July 5, 2017, print edition as 'Tencent Curbs Playing Time for Game.'", "news_time": "2017-07-04 09:02:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/gaming-company-tencent-questioned-over-honor-cuts-kids-play-time-1499173348", "news_title": "In China, Videogames Will Now Start Limiting Screen Time for You ", "keywords": "children,gaming addiction,honor of kings,online gaming,tencent holdings,Tencent Holdings,0700.HK,Kitty Fok,Richard Ko,corporate,industrial news,computers,consumer electronics,software,applications software,computing,games software,internet,online,technology"}, {"content": "One of the nation\u2019s highest-paying jobs that doesn\u2019t require a college degree is facing a shortage of workers. Part of the problem: An ill-fitting moniker.Court reporters do more than just transcribe legal proceedings for courts or legislatures, said Nativa Wood, president of the National Court Reporters Association. They also caption broadcast television shows and public and school events for the hearing-impaired, as well as providing real-time transcripts for everything from business meetings to legal depositions.The field, which many like to date back to ancient scribes, requires training in typing as many as 225 words a minute on a stenotype machine, a chorded keyboard used to transcribe spoken word into shorthand. Students can learn to use the machine in programs offered by trade schools and community colleges.Depending on the industry, their experience and the amount of work they take on, court reporters can make upward of $95,000 a year. Bureau of Labor Statistics data show that the median annual pay for court reporters in 2016 was $51,320. Median pay for all high-school graduates without further education, meanwhile, has hovered around $30,000 over the past several years, according to the National Center for Education.Still, Ms. Wood says the National Court Reporters Association has struggled to attract young workers, hurt by the preconception that court reporting is an antiquated job.Ducker Worldwide, a Troy, Mich.-based global consulting and research firm, estimates that the aging pool of current court reporters, plus declining enrollment rates in training programs, will create a shortfall of nearly 5,500 positions by 2018.Ms. Wood says freelance stenographers are currently in such high demand that some have been forced to put clients on waiting lists, but adds that she hasn\u2019t heard of any impact on businesses or government.One solution to attracting more people to the field, Ms. Wood says, is to retire the name \u201ccourt reporter\u201d and adopt a new one. \u201cIdeally, I believe it should reflect our use of technology and accurately represent the many career paths that can be undertaken once you learn the stenographic machine,\u201d said Ms. Wood.

Two of them were real enough to cause first-round exits for Australia\u2019s Nick Kyrgios and world No. 3 Stan Wawrinka. The third is possibly imaginary, but that hasn\u2019t stopped British tennis fans from worrying anyway\u2014after all, the suspected ailment belongs to Andy Murray.Murray\u2019s buildup to Wimbledon was interrupted by trouble with a sore hip, which saw him bow out of the Queen\u2019s Club warmup tournament early and require twice daily ice baths. Britain was in such a panic that Murray wouldn\u2019t be able to defend his second Wimbledon title that one tabloid last week urged its readers to collectively focus on sending positive vibes in the direction of his hip.For the record, Murray says he is fine now and playing pain-free. But the forensic analysis of his stride on court continued on Monday as he dispatched qualifier Alexander Bublik 6-1, 6-4, 6-2 in under two hours. Every apparent limp, every drag of the leg came in for scrutiny.\u201cI\u2019ve always done it and everyone is sort of saying that I\u2019m walk that way because of my hip. But I have no idea,\u201d Murray said of his loping gait. As he put it later, \u201cI don\u2019t have the smoothest walk at the best of times.\u201dBut Murray, who faces Dustin Brown in second round on Wednesday, does have a slightly smoother path to the final now with Wawrinka out of the tournament\u2014the pair could have met in the quarterfinals. Wawrinka fell apart 6-4, 3-6, 6-4, 6-1 against 21-year-old Danil Medvedev on Monday evening, suffering from knee pain. Wawrinka said he first felt the discomfort at the end of last season and at the Australian Open. But while he was able to manage it on hard courts and clay\u2014he made the final of Roland-Garros only a month ago without a flare-up\u2014grass courts proved to be a surface too far.\u201cSince I had that problem it was the first time I was playing on grass and, apparently, grass is not the best surface for my knee,\u201d he said of his breakdowns at Queen\u2019s and Wimbledon.Unlike Wawrinka, Monday\u2019s other high-profile victim, didn\u2019t even get to finish his match. Kyrgios retired after losing the first two sets to Pierre-Hugues Herbert with a hip injury that he aggravated in a fall at Queen\u2019s. Kyrgios was visibly distraught on court, burying his face in his towel and giving anxious looks to his coach\u2019s box. He knew his tournament was over long before he quit.\u201cI was in such a good place for one set at Queen\u2019s,\u201d he said. \u201cI was really enjoying myself. I was healthy. And then, it was like I had a taste of it, then that was it.\u201dWith injuries up and down the field on Monday, one man who has so often been among the walking wounded in recent seasons was perfectly happy to fly under the radar: Rafael Nadal. The two-time Wimbledon champion arrived here fresh off his 10th French Open title and in better shape than he has been at virtually any point in the past four years.He brushed aside Australia\u2019s John Millman 6-1, 6-3, 6-2 to kick off his first grass-court tournament in two seasons. Like       Roger Federer,        the 31-year-old Nadal is choosing his spots more carefully these days to arrive at the Slams in better shape. And none of the amateur sports physicians milling around Wimbledon on Monday could argue with his logic. Nadal may have skipped the Wimbledon warm-up events, but his grass-court game showed no signs of rust as he mixed his blistering forehand with forays to the net.Asked whether his knees could carry him to a sixth career final here, Nadal refused to look past his next opponent, the American Donald Young.\u201cMy knees are ready for the second round,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m happy that I\u2019m here playing again in Wimbledon with positive feelings in terms of health.\u201dWhich is more than plenty of his rivals can say this year.Write to Joshua Robinson at joshua.robinson@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-04 08:59:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/andy-murray-shakes-off-injury-concerns-at-wimbledon-1499173177", "news_title": "Andy Murray Shakes Off Injury Concerns at Wimbledon", "keywords": "andy murray,nick kyrgios,rafael nadal,stan wawrinka,tennis,wimbledon,sports,recreation,routine general news"}, {"content": "BERLIN\u2014Russia is likely to leak hacked government information in an attempt to influence Germany\u2019s parliamentary election, top security officials said Tuesday, as they pointed to multiple attempts to steal confidential documents in recent months.Hackers linked to Russia, as well as China and Iran, have repeatedly targeted the foreign ministry and its diplomatic missions as well as the finance and economics ministries. Other targets included the chancellery and Germany\u2019s armed forces, according to an annual report by Germany\u2019s domestic intelligence agency.Suspected Russian hackers accessed confidential information from lawmakers in a sophisticated attack in 2015 that shut down parliament\u2019s computer network for days.Stolen communication from that attack could be used to try and change the course of the Sept. 24 election, when Chancellor       Angela Merkel       is seeking a fourth term, the heads of Germany\u2019s interior ministry and domestic intelligence service said.Western officials have repeatedly pointed the finger at Russia since its intervention in Ukraine for engaging in hybrid warfare\u2014an array of hostile acts that range from military provocations to large-scale propaganda campaigns and cyberattacks.Russia has been accused of conducting such attacks ahead of the 2016 U.S. presidential election and the presidential elections in France this spring. The Russian government has denied the allegations.Ms. Merkel will meet Russian President       Vladimir Putin       in Hamburg this week when she chairs this year\u2019s summit of the Group of 20 large economies.\"We have witnessed efforts to influence the elections in America, we have witnessed efforts to influence the vote in France. We have every reason to believe that this originated in Russia,\u201d said German Interior Minister       Thomas de Thomas de Maizi\u00e8re.\u201cWe can therefore not rule out, and must prepare ourselves for, similar attempts with regards to the elections in Germany,\" he said.The minister said it was noteworthy that an extensive amount of communication from the Bundestag, parliament\u2019s lower house, had been siphoned off in the 2015 attack but never released.\u201cIt could be, and I personally expect this, that parts of this will be published over the coming weeks.\"The attack, the most severe in German parliament\u2019s history, took technicians days to stop and prompted an overhaul of parliament\u2019s IT infrastructure, which is kept separate from the more protected networks of the federal government.Germany\u2019s domestic intelligence agency said later a suspected Russian hacker group known as Sofacy or APT28 and linked to politically motivated hacks across the world, appears to have conducted the hack.\u201cVictims of the espionage of confidential e-mails and other sensitive data have to expect that explosive or compromising issues can be made public at any time,\u201d the report warned.Separately, security officials also warned that Germany should expect to brace itself for more terror attacks by Islamic State.Members of the radical salafi branch of Islam, the main recruiting pool for terrorists, now numbered 10,100 in the country, compared with 9,700 in 2016, Germany\u2019s domestic intelligence agency said.Mr. de Maizi\u00e8re said security services had 680 people under surveillance who were thought willing and able to commit attacks, \"the highest number ever.\u201dWrite to Andrea Thomas at andrea.thomas@wsj.comAppeared in the July 5, 2017, print edition as 'Germany Warns Of Hacking Leaks As Vote Approaches.'", "news_time": "2017-07-04 08:35:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/germany-warns-of-hacking-leaks-ahead-of-election-1499171739", "news_title": "Germany Warns of Hacking Leaks Ahead of Election ", "keywords": "cyberattacks,cybersecurity,germany politics,hacking,Germany's interior ministry,political,general news,national,public security,crime,legal action,international relations,cybercrime,politics,domestic politics,espionage,government bodies,legislative branch,elections,presidential elections"}, {"content": "Major League Baseball pitchers have been an evolutionary marvel in recent seasons. They\u2019re throwing the ball harder than ever. Pitches at 100 miles per hour, once an extraordinary feat that left smoke trails across the sport, are now routine.But there\u2019s a problem as the sport\u2019s velocity obsession grows. Pitchers are getting hurt more than ever, with the latest research indicating that this trend is a primary culprit. And it turns out that throwing as hard as you can may not even be the most effective way to pitch.That\u2019s why there\u2019s a new thought surfacing in baseball: that the next step in the evolution on the mound won\u2019t be pitches whizzing by batters even faster. It will be throwing slower\u2014more frequently taking the edge off a pitcher\u2019s top fastball to fool hitters and stay healthier.Pitchers, according to some, are simply overtaxing themselves, averaging a record-high 92.3 mph. Meanwhile, starters are managing a record-low 17 outs per game this year, with many good outings ending early to protect them from injury.\u201cI call it caveman baseball,\u201d says former pitcher       Ron Darling,        now an analyst with SNY and TBS. \u201cSee ball. Throw ball hard.\u201dBut the disabled list shows this isn\u2019t working. There have been a record 243 injury trips by pitchers this year, according to Stats LLC, an increase of nearly 20% from the next highest year since 2000. And it\u2019s not just because of the new 10-day DL, either\u2014they\u2019ve spent about 25% more days on the shelf through June than the average since 2000.Former MLB pitching coach Rick Peterson looks at the pitchers pushing these bounds, sees the injuries, and wonders why. \u201cI would say to pitchers who constantly over throw: Are you trying to win stuffed animals at a circus?\u2019\u201dThere\u2019s no magic number on the radar gun that puts a pitcher at risk. It varies case by case. The real issue is pitchers throwing their hardest. \u201cIf a guy tops off at 96 and pitches the whole game (there), he\u2019s adding a lot more stress on his elbow than if he varies his velocity,\u201d says Dr. Glenn Fleisig, research director of the American Sports Medicine Institute.Fleisig compares the body\u2019s ligaments\u2014like the one in the elbow that tears and requires pitchers to miss a season recovering from Tommy John surgery\u2014to a rubber band. Pull it back as hard as you can and it will start to tear. Pull it less, he says, and \u201cyou\u2019d never tear the rubber band.\u201dASMI researchers recently placed biomechanical markers on 64 professional pitchers that tracked the torque in their elbows as they threw a ball. Throws at a given pitcher\u2019s max velocity produced high levels of stress in the elbow, the type that puts a player at high risk for an injury. But when they threw their fastballs just a shade below their peak velocity, the data revealed a dramatic reduction\u2014just a couple miles per hour slower could be the equivalent of the gentler pulling of the rubber band.It\u2019s a tough sell to convince pitchers to ease up, even just a bit, for the vague promise of health benefits. But research has shown a weak correlation, if there is one at all, between velocity and run prevention, Fleisig says. And varying fastball velocity may actually make hurlers tougher to hit.Some of the game\u2019s best and healthiest pitchers have shown a keen grasp of just this. And that\u2019s no surprise to Darling, who said he was able to thwart the game\u2019s best hitters in his prime by saving his best fastball for when it was most needed. \u201cI\u2019d throw 92 but had 95 when I needed it.\u201d He said hitters would kick themselves for missing a fastball, \u201cbut they didn\u2019t miss it. They were expecting 92.\u201dSo it\u2019s no coincidence that the two pitchers who vary their fastball velocities the most are also two of the best pitchers in baseball. Cardinals ace Carlos Martinez and Boston\u2019s Chris Sale, a leading Cy Young contender, throw over 50% of their pitches at least 2 mph faster or slower than their average velocity. Those are the highest rates in the game, and about twice as often as the average starter. It has helped Sale defy widespread expectations that his velocity and mechanics would cause him to break down by now.Don Cooper, Sale\u2019s former pitching coach with the White Sox, said their epiphany came in 2015 when Sale set the team\u2019s single-season strikeout record but rarely pitched deep into games. Then they discovered he could be just as good, for longer, by taking just a touch off his heater.\u201cIt was a risky thing, to tell you the truth, to do it with Sale,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cBecause if it didn\u2019t succeed, they\u2019d say, \u2018Why are you messing with the best guy in baseball?\u2019\u201dMets fireballers Steven Matz and Noah Syndergaard, the game\u2019s hardest throwing starter last year, struggle with injuries. Syndergaard is currently on the 60-day DL with a torn lat and has said in the past he\u2019s not interested in slowing things down. Both he and Matz have relatively little fastball variance (15.7% and 18.1%, respectively).\u201cPitchers are told to pitch to the gun to get money so they\u2019re trying to hit a number knowing millions of dollars are waiting,\u201d Darling says. \u201cNoah and Steven, really most pitchers generally, are from the school that when you have your mechanics firing perfectly the ball will come out at the same speed.\u201dThis group that tends to not vary fastball speed significantly includes Michael Fulmer (Tigers, 18.9%), Stephen Strasburg (Nationals, 18.2%) and Jameson Taillon (Pirates, 15.8%).All three also score poorly in another metric: maximum velocity (an average of their 10 fastest pitches) minus average velocity. The MLB-wide variance is just 3.2 mph, but Sale and Martinez clock in at 4.8 and 4.2, respectively. Sale averages just 93.2 mph but clearly can throw 98 mph when the need arises. Martinez, if he chose to, could regularly crack triple digits.The question is whether exceptions like Sale and Martinez can become the rule. Cardinals pitcher Adam Wainwright, struggling this year at the age of 35, and coming off a nine-run shellacking in June in which he only recorded five outs, said he studied the film and realized he was working too hard. He followed that up with just one earned run over seven innings, saying afterwards his goal was to \u201cthrow two, maybe three balls hard all day.\u201dCorrections & AmplificationsJameson Taillon is a pitcher for the Pittsburgh Pirates.

Mr. Trump is expected to try to rally other international leaders behind stricter United Nations sanctions on North Korea and urge stronger measures by China to restrain North Korean leader       Kim Jong Un.\u201cThis test is a heavy blow for China,\u201d said       Zhu Feng,        an international security expert at China\u2019s Nanjing University. \u201cBeijing wants to see the U.S. talking with North Korea and not just emphasizing sanctions and isolation. But North Korea keeps escalating the tension.\u201dMr. Xi has trod a careful line with Mr. Trump, who for months has appealed to Beijing to rein in its North Korean neighbor.\u00a0China has backed existing U.N. sanctions and banned imports of North Korean coal, a recent key source of revenue, while opposing more potent measures that might destabilize Pyongyang, triggering a flood of refugees into northeastern China and bringing U.S. troops closer to the Chinese border.Even before the test, Mr. Trump signaled his rising frustration with Beijing, in recent days by approving a big arms sale to Taiwan, sending a U.S. Navy destroyer close to a Chinese-held island in the South China Sea and sanctioning two Chinese companies and two Chinese nationals for alleged dealings with North Korea.Soon after Tuesday\u2019s test, Mr. Trump posted on             Twitter                   another appeal to Beijing, saying \u201cPerhaps China will put a heavy move on North Korea and end this nonsense once and for all!\u201dChina\u2019s options for ratcheting up pressure on Pyongyang include cutting exports of oil and other essential goods, reducing imports of commodities such as iron ore, and banning Chinese tourists from North Korea, said Nanjing University\u2019s Mr. Zhu.He said that Beijing might also consider discussing contingency plans with the U.S. over what would happen in the event of a military strike against Pyongyang\u2014something that the Chinese leadership has been reluctant to do despite repeated urgings from Washington.Fueling Beijing\u2019s caution are disagreements within the civilian and military leadership over how to respond, with some arguing that a united, democratic Korea poses a greater threat to Beijing than a nuclear-armed Pyongyang, other Chinese experts said.At a regular briefing Tuesday, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said the issue was \u201ccomplicated and sensitive\u201d and reiterated Beijing\u2019s position that China opposes any North Korean actions that violate U.N. Security Council resolutions.The spokesman,       Geng Shuang,        urged all countries involved to \u201cremain calm and exercise restraint, stop irritating each other, work hard to create an atmosphere for contact and dialogue between all sides, and seek a return to the correct path of dialogue and negotiation as soon as possible.\u201dChina has repeatedly suggested that North Korea halt its nuclear program in exchange for a suspension of joint military exercises between the U.S. and South Korea\u2014a proposal rejected by Washington.Zhang Liangui,        an expert on North Korea at the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s Central Party School, said Beijing\u2019s position was unlikely to change fundamentally until it recognized that Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear-weapons program didn\u2019t just threaten the U.S.\u201cIn China, a considerable number of people think the North Korean nuclear issue is not a matter for China, but is between the U.S. and North Korea,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s an absolute mistake for the U.S. to rely on China to resolve the problem.\u201d\u2014Kersten Zhang and Yang Jie contributed to this article.Write to Jeremy Page at jeremy.page@wsj.comAppeared in the July 5, 2017, print edition as 'Missile Test Puts China in Tough Spot.'", "news_time": "2017-07-04 08:28:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/north-koreas-latest-missile-test-puts-china-in-a-corner-1499171313", "news_title": "North Korea\u2019s Latest Missile Test Puts China in a Corner", "keywords": "donald trump,northkoreacarousel, north korea icbm, north korea missile,north korea nuclear,north korea weapons, pyongyang, trump,Nanjing University,Xi Jinping,Kim Jong Un,Trump,political,general news,national,public security,armed forces,politics,international relations,risk news,military action,weapons programs"}, {"content": "With great power comes great responsibility.

Articles in the paper compared the game \u201cHonor of Kings\u201d to \u201cpoison\u201d and cited examples it said showed how the game is detrimental to China\u2019s youth. A teenager in Guangzhou, for example, almost died after playing the game for 40 hours nonstop, the articles claimed.The criticism has continued even though Tencent on Monday said it would limit game time for children, banning them from playing it after 9 p.m.It isn\u2019t the first time Beijing has used its bully pulpit to hammer a major Chinese internet company. When a Chinese college student died after following a cancer treatment he found on search engine             Baidu                   last year, the government heightened scrutiny of online medical advertising. That led to several quarters of falling revenue at Baidu.Tencent investors are right to feel a chill from such state criticism, and to fear tighter control of mobile games.Tencent has to date carried all before it in China, dominating online games and, in recent years, social networking through its pervasive WeChat app, which has almost 1 billion users. \u201cHonor of Kings\u201d itself is a smash hit with over 50 million daily active users: It was the world\u2019s top-grossing mobile game in May, according to data researcher App Annie, and contributed almost half of Tencent\u2019s mobile game revenue in the first quarter, gaming research firm CNG estimates. Mobile gaming in turn makes up a quarter of Tencent\u2019s revenue and is one of its fastest-growing segments.A more ominous concern is that Beijing has decided it is time to remind China\u2019s internet giants who the ultimate boss is. In an economy that is dominated by state-owned enterprises, the tech sector is a rare spot where private firms like Tencent\u2014along with             Alibaba Group Holding                   and Baidu reign supreme.

That was well above a year ago, when it averaged 3.48%.Economists had widely predicted mortgage rates to rise to around 4.5% by the end of this year. That looks increasingly unlikely. Dimming prospects for the Republican legislative agenda, especially tax reform, have helped keep a ceiling on rates.To be sure, mortgage rates, which tend to track 10-year Treasury yields, are likely to move higher as investors anticipate that short-term interest rates will rise due to tightening monetary policy in both the U.S. and Europe.Lower rates typically lead to an increase in refinancing activity, although after several years in which rates have hovered near historic lows there are a limited number of homeowners who could refinance to a significantly lower rate.Cheaper mortgages can also help bring buyers off the sidelines by making homes slightly more affordable.But that increased demand is likely to bump up against a lack of for-sale supply. The National Association of Realtors Pending Home Sales Index\u2014a forward-looking indicator of housing demand\u2014tumbled 0.8% in May, the third consecutive decline.

More broadly, they question whether the county will be able to hold a private operator accountable for any problems that could arise.The county is accepting bids from private operators for the chance to sign a 40-year lease to run the Westchester County Airport, which sits on the border of Greenwich, Conn.             American Airlines Group Inc.,Delta Air Lines Inc.,JetBlue Airways Corp.       and             United Continental Holdings Inc.       all currently operate commercial flights out of the airport.Bids are due July 14 and the winning bidder must be approved by 12 out of 17 members of the Westchester County Board of Legislators later this year. County officials expect about five or six bids for the contract.Mr. Astorino, a Republican, says the upside for taxpayers is clear. The county will remain the owner of the airport, but under the privatization plan, the airport will make money for the county and will be better run with upgraded passenger lounges, ticketing areas and concessions, he said.\u201cThe work gets done quicker and more efficiently by the private company and we actually get to keep some of the profits at the airport and apply them to holding the line on taxes,\u201d Mr. Astorino said.Westchester County has owned the airport since the World War II era. During that entire time, the county has used a private operator to manage the airport. The revenue currently made by the airport can only be spent on airport operations, per Federal Aviation Administration regulations.But Westchester County joined a pilot program in 2016 run by the FAA that allows officials for the first time to spend money generated by the airport for county expenses on things like police officers and road work.Tim Halpern from Waccabuc, N.Y., about 25 miles north of the airport, said he is sympathetic to the county\u2019s pitch that a new private operator will be able to run the airport better. But he isn\u2019t convinced that\u2019s what\u2019s best for the community, he said.\u201cI don\u2019t what my house to get any louder,\u201d Mr. Halperin said. \u201cI don\u2019t want my quality of life further eroded.\u201dCounty officials say a future operator will continue to take environmental protections seriously, including being a responsible neighbor to the Kensico Reservoir, which provides drinking water to New York City. And concerns that plane traffic into and out of the airport could dramatically increase are overblown, county officials said, because a new operator would have to operate in the current footprint of the airport and wouldn\u2019t be able to add terminals or gates.\u201cEverything is working within the footprint of the airport,\u201d Mr. Astorino said. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty much built out.\u201dThe county\u2019s local law that limits the number of passengers that can pass through the terminal at 240 per half-hour will remain in effect.Jonathan Wang, chairman of Citizens for a Responsible County Airport, notes the cap doesn\u2019t apply to private planes and corporate jets, which make up about 80% of the airport\u2019s operations. And the Westchester County Board of Legislators will now have a financial incentive to change the local law to raise the passenger cap to make more money once the airport is privatized, Mr. Wang said.The county and the private operator will \u201chave a strong incentive to increase profits whether by increasing the number of operations at the airport or by cutting costs on things like security or environmental protection,\u201d said Mr. Wang, who lives in Purchase, N.Y.Some critics of the privatization plan say a new operator would be tougher to fire should it perform badly since the term of the lease could be up to 40 years. County officials say the lease agreement will allow them to terminate the contract for good cause.Mr. Astorino in November initially selected             Oaktree Capital                   Management to run the airport in a deal that would have provided the county with more than $140 million over a 40-year deal. But legislators from the Westchester County Board of Legislators balked and pushed for a bidding process to screen for the best offer from several firms.AvPorts, a firm from Virginia that currently operates the Westchester County Airport, also could make a bid for the contract. The company didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.Mr. Astorino said he expects the winning bidder to at least match Oaktree\u2019s initial offer.Michael Kaplowitz,        chairman of the board of legislators, said the privatization proposal currently doesn\u2019t have the 12 votes on the board needed to pass because many legislators, like himself, remain undecided.\u201cI want to see what the bid is that is ultimately accepted, and I need to get down to the details on a granular level of that bid,\u201d said Mr. Kaplowitz, a Democrat.Write to Joseph De Avila at joseph.deavila@wsj.comAppeared in the July 5, 2017, print edition as 'Airport Plan Stirs Worries.'", "news_time": "2017-07-04 07:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/westchester-countys-airport-plan-hits-some-turbulence-1499166004", "news_title": "Westchester County\u2019s Airport Plan Hits Some Turbulence ", "keywords": " airport privatization plan, environmental concerns, residents' opposition,westchester county airport,Delta Air Lines,DAL,JetBlue Airways,JBLU,American Airlines Group,AAL,United Continental Holdings,UAL,airlines,scheduled passenger airlines,rental,leasing services,air transport,automotive,business,consumer services,low cost airlines,transportation,logistics"}, {"content": "The FAA\u2019s Airport Privatization Pilot Program is 20 years old.

In May, Oaktree sold its 50% stake in the venture for $430 million.Oaktree is bidding for Westchester County Airport, in partnership with Connor Capital of California.The U.S. Government Accountability Office audit found that four airports have withdrawn from the program citing the financial stability of their private partners.Mr. Bosco, who is helping to lead the bid company, HPN Aviation Group, said financing won\u2019t be an issue.He said that although public entities borrow at the lowest rates, private companies involved in public-private partnerships, in particular in airports, can secure competitive rates that make such deals attractive.\u201cWe\u2019re confident that we can compete with anyone,\u201d Mr. Bosco said.He added that HPN is more concerned by the lack of local support for the privatization plan. \u201cWe hope it doesn\u2019t get in the way of the clear picture of benefit it offers to Westchester County and its taxpayers,\u201d he said.Write to Paul Berger at Paul.Berger@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-04 07:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/effort-to-privatize-airports-fails-to-take-off-1499166004", "news_title": "Effort to Privatize Airports Fails to Take Off", "keywords": " airport privatization, faa,faa program,new york airport,privatization deals, san juan puerto rico airport,westchester county airport,FAA,ownership changes,privatizations,nationalization,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,airports,air transport,transportation,logistics"}, {"content": "Portland, Ore.Unless you hail from Oregon, chances are you have never heard of       John Yeon       (1910-1994).

A collaboration of the museum and the University of Oregon\u2019s John Yeon Center for Architecture and the Landscape, it was curated by       Randy Gragg,        the center\u2019s executive director.From the 1930s on, the Museum of Modern Art took a much more selective approach to Yeon, focusing on only a single house\u2014Yeon\u2019s first, designed in 1937\u2014and championing it in multiple exhibitions to promote American regional modernism. The crusade was taken up by House Beautiful and other influential design magazines eager to promote a homegrown modern architectural style over the dominant internationalism of Europeans like       Mies van der Rohe       and       Walter Gropius.Featured in the Portland museum show, the Watzek House (the client was       Aubrey Watzek,        a close friend, fellow parks commissioner and lumber baron) fits the bill only to a point. Its rooms are enfolded around a lushly planted courtyard dripping in wisteria and decorated with a small stone pool. Rooms pinwheel off this central opening, each one timbered, clad, coffered or paneled in some local wood and detailed with the meticulous craft of a Japanese tea house, a far cry from modernism\u2019s utilitarian open plan.Yeon completed only 18 buildings, mostly homes, the last one in 1955. His less ambitious houses are the most successful, distinguished more by their unpretentious but beautiful woodwork than by their ranch-house-flavored elevations. His greater legacy was in preserving, even carving out, scenic landscapes along the Columbia River Gorge. Among his accomplishments in local conservation, Yeon wrote the equivalent of the state\u2019s first environmental impact statement, campaigned for decades to protect Olympic National Park, and saved wave-slammed Chapman Point from development by buying it, and from erosion by planting it with sea grasses and spruce trees. It\u2019s called the John Yeon State Natural Area.Yeon\u2019s architecture may not be the keystone of an American regional modernism, as it was once pitched, but his keen understanding that beauty in any guise can be transformative is always relevant.\u2014Ms. Iovine reviews architecture for the Journal.Appeared in the July 5, 2017, print edition as 'The Architectural Prince of Portland.'", "news_time": "2017-07-04 07:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/quest-for-beauty-the-architecture-landscapes-and-collections-of-john-yeon-review-the-architectural-prince-of-portland-1499166001", "news_title": "\u2018Quest for Beauty: The Architecture, Landscapes, and Collections of John Yeon\u2019 Review: The Architectural Prince of Portland", "keywords": " and collections of john yeon, architecture,arts in review, conservation, landscapes, local architecture, portland, portland art museum,quest for beauty, the architecture,John Yeon,architecture,art,political,general news,arts,entertainment,reviews"}, {"content": "Jim Schultz,        66, a retired industrial salesman from Chino Valley, Ariz., on his 35 Oldsmobiles, as told to A.J. Baime.The car you see pictured here\u2014a 1957 Oldsmobile 88 Holiday Sedan\u2014turns 60 this year, and no one outside my family has ever touched it with a wrench. My father did all the maintenance for the first owner, and 50 years ago, he bought the car for about $400. He loved this car so much, an image of it is carved into his headstone.I was born into a family of Oldsmobile fans. My father worked as a mechanic at Olds dealerships and at his own garage, and he bought and sold Oldsmobiles to help support our family while I was growing up. I started working at his garage at age 12. Everywhere I looked, there were Oldsmobiles.I began collecting them years ago, and my late wife was a good sport. I have a 6,000-square-foot metal building on my property I call my toy box, and I have filled it with Oldsmobiles. Today I have about 35. My wife used to say, \u201cYou\u2019d better not bring any more home. If you do, it had better be big enough for you to go live in.\u201dMy oldest Oldsmobile is a 1940 Series 90, with the industry\u2019s first-ever automatic transmission. My newest is a 1989 Custom Cruiser station wagon I call the Lab Cab, because I\u2019ve driven the vehicle all over the country with my black labs in the back. I have six Toronados and some Rocket 88s. But the car I always come back to is the 1957 88 Holiday.I am president of the National Antique Oldsmobile Club, and earlier this month, I brought the 88 Holiday to our annual convention, in Reading, Pa. (That\u2019s where these pictures were taken.) The car has its original, unrestored paint and engine. I recently put new tires on it, so it has new sneakers. After all these years, it drives like a dream.General Motors phased out the Oldsmobile. The last vehicle rolled out of the factory on April 29, 2004. Someone has to collect and maintain these cars. If everyone knew how wonderfully they were engineered, they would be too expensive for us fans to buy. Olds fans think of these vehicles as the best-kept secret in the car-collecting hobby, and that\u2019s the way we like it.\u2014Contact A.J.

In the second quarter, growth in business lending fell to its slowest pace since spring 2011. Long-term interest rates remain close to historically low levels, despite an uptick in the last week of June. And market volatility remains subdued, resulting in muted trading activity.\u201cAs we head into the second half of the year, the question is how long can banks fight the fundamentals,\u201d said James Chappell, an analyst at banking group Berenberg. \u201cEarnings expectations may be too high.\u201dWorries about banks\u2019 underlying performance have weighed on bank stocks this year, even though first-quarter results were strong. Financial stocks in the S&P 500 have led all sectors since last November\u2019s election, but the bulk of the gains came in late 2016. In the first half of 2017, financial stocks trailed the broader market.In the second quarter, the KBW Nasdaq Bank index, which tracks 24 of the U.S.\u2019s biggest banks, lagged behind the S&P 500 until the stress-test results were announced on June 28. The end-of-quarter surge happened as banks announced shareholder payouts\u2014through dividends and share buybacks\u2014that are just shy of their highest level relative to earnings in nearly two decades, according to analysts at Barclays.Regional banks didn\u2019t get the same bump. The KBW Regional Banking index was nearly unchanged in the second quarter, trailing the broader market. In the first half, it was down more than 4%.Besides the immediate prospect of more cash in hand for shareholders, the stress tests also bolstered investor hopes that the Trump administration would usher in a period of less-stringent bank regulation. That approach could help bolster returns on equity, which have remained tepid.Donald Trump\u2019s election spurred hopes for even broader changes from Washington, namely a tax-code overhaul and policies, such as major infrastructure spending, that would promote stronger economic growth. But these have yet to bear fruit.That has led to a decline in confidence that growth will accelerate. As a result, long-term interest rates slid in the second quarter. After a sharp rise in yields following the election, the 10-year Treasury note topped out at 2.6% in mid-March. The 10-year yield rose in late June and recently hovered around 2.3%.At the same time, short-term rates have marched higher thanks to continued increases in the Fed\u2019s rates. The Fed increased its short-term target in June to between 1% and 1.25%.The result: The difference in yields between 10-year and two-year Treasurys, which is a proxy for the profits banks can make from borrowing and lending money, fell below 1 percentage point in mid-May. It has stayed there since and closed the quarter at 0.90 percentage point. In the wake of the election, the spread topped out at 1.35 percentage points in late December.Bank of America Corp.       Chief Executive       Brian Moynihan       told investors in May that the bank\u2019s potential net-interest income growth in the second quarter could be lower by tens of millions of dollars compared with the first quarter. \u201cWe always follow the [yield] curve, and it\u2019s been lower,\u201d Mr. Moynihan said at an investor conference.Investors have been following it, too. After starting the year with a relatively big allocation to banking, Jason Benowitz, a senior portfolio manager at Roosevelt Investments, said he has dialed back on banks over the course of the year. \u201cOur forward concerns are around declines in long-term yields and slowing loan growth,\u201d Mr. Benowitz said.That, he added, may now be of greater import than the stress-test outcome. \u201cPeople have been gearing up for capital return for a few months, and it\u2019s in the market,\u201d Mr. Benowitz said.The other point of concern, slowing lending activity, is a bit of a mystery. Bank executives have been at a loss to explain the decline, especially given the surge of optimism among business owners following the election.Loans and leases in bank credit, which are counted on a weekly basis, were up 3.8% in late June compared with the same period in 2016, according to Fed data released on Friday. That was the slowest rate of growth in more than three years. The week before the presidential election, banks registered a 7.3% rate.Meanwhile, trading activity has been held back as hopes for an uptick in inflation, which would lead long-term interest rates higher, have faded. Also, volatility levels during the quarter plumbed historic lows, which also suppressed trading.Executives at             J.P. Morgan Chase                   & Co. and             Citigroup Inc.       warned during the second quarter that trading revenues may be down by double-digit percentage points from those of the year-earlier period.Reflecting such concerns, analyst estimates for second-quarter earnings per share at the six biggest U.S. banks have declined between March and June. The same day the stress-test capital returns were announced last week, Credit Suisse Group analysts reduced earnings estimates for             Goldman Sachs Group Inc.       and             Morgan Stanley                   \u201cto better reflect the current low volume, low volatility trading environment.\u201dWrite to Telis Demos at telis.demos@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-04 07:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/what-not-to-love-about-bank-stocks-right-now-1499166006", "news_title": "What Not to Love About Bank Stocks Right Now", "keywords": "2q market report,bank earnings,bank nii,banks,goldman sachs,morgan stanley,net-interest income,treasury yields,yield spread,financial performance,earnings,dividends,corporate funding,share capital,ownership changes,acquisitions,mergers,divestments,corporate actions,corporate,industrial news,share buybacks,monetary policy,interest rates,economic news,equity markets,commodity,financial market news,banking,commercial banking,financial investments,investment banking,credit,financial services,investing,securities"}, {"content": "ZURICH\u2014            Clariant AG\u2019s        CLZNY -1.56%       bid to create a $14 billion chemicals giant through a merger with U.S.-based             Huntsman Corp.

Its effort has the support of Corvex Management and Mr. Meister, a well-known U.S. activist investor and former lieutenant of       Carl Icahn.Corvex last flexed its muscles only recently, disclosing in May a 5.5% stake in             CenturyLink Inc.       The U.S. telecommunications company is in a deal to acquire             Level 3 Communications Inc.       and Mr. Meister is pushing for Level 3\u2019s chief executive to eventually become the CEO of the combined company instead of CenturyLink\u2019s leader.Standard Industries is no stranger to Europe. In December it agreed to acquire German roof maker Braas Monier Building Group SA for about \u20ac1.1 billion ($1.2 billion) after raising its offer to end an hostile takeover effort.Huntsman and Clariant announced their proposed trans-Atlantic tie-up in May amid a period of consolidation in the chemicals industry as companies seek to cut costs by eliminating overlapping operations and products, and identify new sources of revenue by tapping new markets and customers. The deals are also designed to help chemical producers combine resources to bolster research and development efforts.Praxair Inc.       and Germany\u2019s             Linde AG       are working toward completing their merger to create the biggest industrial-gas company with a market value of more than $70 billion.

Swimming across the sea was another option, but deadlier. Escapees risked sharks or drowning.Nowadays, few would think of trying. Hong Kong is losing its luster; Shenzhen has grown into an aspirational city, the tech hardware capital of the world and a magnet for talent\u2014both Chinese and foreign.The swinging fortunes of these two southern neighbors place the onetime British colony in a somewhat precarious position.It challenges some of the assumptions that underpinned Hong Kong\u2019s return to China exactly two decades ago, with political privileges that no other part of the country enjoys. It could even call into question its very existence as a separate entity.Next to Shenzhen, Hong Kong is starting to look ordinary, and this reality clouds its future. Chinese President       Xi Jinping\u2019s       lecture to Hong Kong last week, in a handover anniversary speech, about behaviors that \u201ccross the red line\u201d was at once a threat aimed at political dissenters and a sign that Beijing is more ready to boss around a place that\u2019s slipping down the Chinese urban rankings.Hong Kong\u2019s GDP has shriveled from the equivalent of 18% of China\u2019s in 1997 to just 3% today. Hong Kong\u2019s port, once the world\u2019s busiest, has slipped to fifth position, behind both Shenzhen and Shanghai.The more Hong Kong resembles just another Chinese city, the faster Beijing recalculates the risks and rewards of a deal it struck with London in a different era.A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman has even declared that the Sino-British Joint Declaration, which laid the groundwork for the handover, \u201cno longer has any realistic meaning.\u201dDeng Xiaoping\u2019s       pragmatic \u201cOne Country, Two Systems\u201d formula for the territory was predicated on the notion that a uniquely successful society\u2014the richest, most globalized, most financially sophisticated city in China -- required its own special arrangements to prosper. Hong Kong kept its independent judiciary and individual freedoms.Of course, implicit in the deal was that the world didn\u2019t trust Chinese Communist officials with the controls over such a vibrant endeavor. Prince Charles reportedly called them \u201cappalling old waxworks\u201d in a 1997 diary entry.But when it comes to Shenzhen, these fusty bureaucrats have done surprisingly well, if only by staying out of the way. Although credit for transforming Shenzhen into a booming manufacturing export hub goes largely to Hong Kong investors, who brought in skills and international connections, the city\u2019s latest incarnation as a technology powerhouse is a domestic story.Meanwhile, a complacent Hong Kong relies on banking, real estate and other services. Innovation has largely failed to take off.Shenzhen\u2019s exuberant optimism recalls Hong Kong\u2019s earlier days, before astronomical rents and growing wealth disparities soured a generation of young people. Tech giants like Huawei and Tencent are hiring, and their armies of graduates can find affordable lodgings, even if it\u2019s just a cramped room in a walk-up in one of Shenzhen\u2019s \u201curban villages.\u201dThere\u2019s a frenetic energy here, too. In Shenzhen, says       David Li,        a founder of the Open Innovation Lab, a tech startup incubator, the \u201csound of money\u201d is the crackle of duct tape sealing boxes of smartphones, MP3 players and drones for overseas shipment from the world\u2019s largest electronics markets.Don\u2019t write off Hong Kong\u2019s prospects yet. Since the handover, Hong Kong has grown faster than almost any other comparable international economy, powered by Chinese tourist dollars and real-estate investment\u2014as well as its role as a financial conduit in China\u2019s rise.And Hong Kong\u2019s position as a glittering financial center is safe, so long as rule of law survives. That British legacy may ultimately hinge on Beijing\u2019s interpretation of the concept. The president of the Chinese Supreme People\u2019s Court a few months ago condemned \u201cerroneous\u201d Western ideas of judicial independence.Hong Kong is in relative decline. Shenzhen\u2019s stock market turnover is higher, its startup culture livelier. Soon, it will overtake its neighbor in economic size.Increasingly, Beijing views Hong Kong as a component\u2014and not the most important one\u2014of a megacity of more than 60 million people seamlessly connected by bridges, tunnels, subways and high-speed rail around the Pearl River delta.New Hong Kong leader       Carrie Lam       is under strong pressure to bring the city into political alignment by introducing national security laws and \u201cpatriotic education\u201d in schools. That would only sharpen the antagonism between Beijing loyalists and pro-democracy activists.An ungovernable Hong Kong might tempt Beijing to intervene directly. Already, its agents have snatched away booksellers from Hong Kong\u2019s streets. A tycoon who may have known too much about Chinese palace politics hasn\u2019t been seen since he disappeared from a Hong Kong hotel.For now, the barbed-wire border, complete with immigration controls, remains the most visible symbol of Hong Kong\u2019s political separation. But it\u2019s a thin line. In almost every other sense, the colonial-era barrier once known as the Bamboo Curtain is history.Write to Andrew Browne at andrew.browne@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-04 05:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-less-shiny-hong-kong-is-easier-to-boss-around-1499160600", "news_title": "A Less Shiny Hong Kong Is Easier to Boss Around", "keywords": "andy browne column,basic law,china's world,china free trade zone,hong kong,hong kong protests,manufacturing,one country two systems,special administrative region,political,general news,disasters,accidents"}, {"content": "HONG KONG\u2014A scion of one of the richest family empires in this megalopolis is making a bold bet to turn a dowdy strip of waterfront into a glamorous front-row seat to one of the world\u2019s most stunning skylines.Adrian Cheng,        grandson of the late Cheng Yu-tung, the legendary real estate and jewelry magnate, has re-envisioned the tip of Tsim Sha Tsui, which has fallen short in terms of commercial development even though it is popular with tourists, families and teenage lovers gazing at the neon field of lights across Victoria Harbour.

New World is planning to charge some of the highest office rents in the city for space in a location that is not known as a prime office district.The family also is working with a new design that makes more use of the open air in the retail and public spaces than other megaprojects in the city. \u201cI think it\u2019s a big gamble,\u201d said Forth Bagley, a principal at the Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates firm in New York and a key architect on the project, about the size of New World\u2019s investment.Mr. Bagley compared it to Hudson Yards, a gigantic development on New York\u2019s waterfront that his firm is also helping to design. That project, which created a new place above a rail yard that has been attracting big-name tenants like             BlackRock Inc.,KKR                   & Co. and             Time Warner Inc.Mr. Bagley predicts that New World will enjoy similar success in Hong Kong. The developer \u201cdid so much, that it\u2019s not going to fail.\u201dIn Hong Kong, the site of Victoria Dockside has had a few lives: first as a bustling logistics\u00a0and trade wharf in the early 20th century; later a New World Centre commercial\u00a0complex, which the developer closed in 2009. The Avenue of Stars there\u2014Hong\u00a0Kong\u2019s version of the Hollywood Walk of Fame\u2014became famous for featuring the\u00a0plaques\u00a0and some handprints\u00a0of Chinese and Hong Kong celebrities, including       Jackie Chan       and\u00a0      Maggie Cheung,        and a life-size statue of a posing       Bruce Lee.Earlier plans to revamp the area faced controversy for not including enough public opinion in the planning process. A proposed observation deck and movie-history gallery at the eastern end of the promenade was also criticized for possibly blocking the views of some buildings behind it. Hong Kong\u2019s Town Planning Board scrapped those\u00a0plans last February. In response, New World slightly downsized the project. The deck and gallery are out, for now.\u201cSo it languishes, and that\u2019s a pity,\u201d said       Paul Zimmerman       about the eastern\u00a0waterfront of Tsim Sha Tsui. Mr. Zimmerman is a local elected official and a\u00a0member of the Harbourfront Commission, which advises the government on\u00a0development plans along the waterfront.Mr. Cheng declined to comment on the government\u2019s actions.On a recent muggy afternoon, jackhammering noises and banging boomed from the construction project. While the Avenue of Stars remains closed until late next year,\u00a0visitors can still climb up to a two-story platform nearby to snap photos of\u00a0the view, or eat a Hong Kong-style snack from one of the food trucks parked\u00a0close by.\u201cAll the tourists want to come here to see the celebrities of the Avenue of Stars,\u201d one\u00a0of the food-truck workers said as he handed out a box of spicy shrimp wontons.\u00a0\u201cBut once they get here, they find out they can\u2019t, so there\u2019s not that many\u00a0people coming around anymore,\u201d he said, though he expects a new flow of business once the avenue is open again. The public park, Salisbury Garden, is\u00a0expected to reopen August.Drawings of the new Avenue of Stars envision a dreamier, more romantic mood than the old walkway, renderings from New York landscape architecture firm James Corner Field Operations show. Curved shell-shaped leafy awnings shade benches. Mini food\u00a0carts, vending machines and soft lights dot the promenade. Movies\u00a0can\u00a0be\u00a0projected onto the spray from a water fountain. The side of the waterfront is\u00a0more striking: From the perspective from a boat on the harbor, it looks like\u00a0giant dragon scales.In the background, the recently topped-out Rosewood hotel, stretching nearly 1,000\u00a0feet high, looks like a toothpick. New skyscrapers have been popping up since\u00a0the government removed height restrictions in 1998 after the old Kai Tak\u00a0airport closed. Before, planes used to make a notoriously harrowing landing that swooped closely by tall office buildings.Mr. Bagley\u2019s biggest challenge for Victoria Dockside was to design the Rosewood building in such a way \u201cso you\u2019re not just plunking down a huge tower,\u201d he said. He\u2019s also trying something unusual for a place as humid as Hong Kong: Opening up more of\u00a0the edifice to the outdoors. Hong Kong is mostly full of plinths, giant boxes\u00a0of shops and offices blasting cold air.\u201cThat\u2019s the gamble,\u201d Mr. Bagley said. \u201cThat people are going to want to be outside.\u201d\u2014Peter Grant contributed to this article.Write to Dominique Fong at dominique.fong@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-04 05:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/hong-kong-scion-betting-billions-on-new-vision-for-avenue-of-stars-site-1499160605", "news_title": "Hong Kong Scion Betting Billions on New Vision for Avenue of Stars Site", "keywords": "adrian cheng,avenue of stars,hk property report,hong kong waterfront,property report,tsim sha tsui,victoria dockside,victoria harbour,New World Development,0017.HK,HK:0017,James Corner Field Operations,plans,strategy,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,celebrities,living,lifestyle,politics,international relations,urban planning,development,domestic politics,regional politics,real estate,construction"}, {"content": "After the presidential election last year, many hedge-fund managers called the U.S. a great moneymaking opportunity. It turns out Europe is the place to be.Bets on stocks in Italy, France and Spain\u2014long laggards compared with the U.S.\u2014have given some global hedge funds returns of more than 20% so far this year. The average hedge fund has managed only 3% through May, according to the most recent data from Hedge Fund Research.\u201cWe\u2019ve been quite aggressively long Europe in the last year,\u201d said       Pieter Taselaar,        founder of Greenwich, Conn.-based Lucerne, which manages $750 million in assets. Its main fund is up 20.5% this year through June 15, according to a person familiar with the matter.A sustained rebound in Europe, should it come to pass, would reshape global markets. Most European bourses remain mired below their 2007 peaks. The euro and the British pound have been slumping for a decade.Eurozone GDP growth hit its second-highest level since 2011 in the first quarter at 0.6%, beating U.S. GDP growth of 0.4%. The European PMI, a survey of manufacturing activity, reached a 74-month high last month. Growth is solid not only in Germany but also in the onetime trouble spots of Spain and Portugal.Markets have reacted to the economic growth, relative political calm and a sense that the worst of Europe\u2019s sovereign-debt crisis is behind it. In local-currency terms the S&P is outpacing the Stoxx Europe 600, but after accounting for the euro\u2019s rise a dollar investor would have done much better in the European index, making 13.8% versus 8.5%.Earlier this year Lucerne started to add significantly to exposure in France, Spain and Italy, said Mr. Taselaar, while reducing exposure to Scandinavia, considered a haven in difficult times. The fund bought stocks such as Italian bank             UniCredit,       up 26% this year, and French house builder             Kaufman & Broad,       up 11%, the person said.Mr. Taselaar expects European economic growth to be between 2% and 3% in the next two to three years, as demand rebounds and companies begin to invest more. Investments that perform well in better times and in countries that had been struggling are places \u201cwhere we see 50% returns right now,\u201d he said.Yet foreign investors who have pounced on previous glimmers of hope in Greece and elsewhere have been repeatedly singed. Some them are cautious this time, fearing the rebound is just temporary.They point to familiar concerns such as inflexible labor-market rules across Europe, an aging population, constraints on government spending and the still-unknown impact of Brexit on European growth.A study by             J.P. Morgan Chase                   & Co. showed that the 29 largest active equity mutual funds with global mandates\u2014predominantly U.S.-based\u2014haven\u2019t added euro-zone shares this year as a group.Bullish hedge funds say European markets will climb further once the skeptics come around. Besides, they say, a sustainable recovery is less important for hedge funds, which can quickly exit positions if desired.\u201cIt appears the mood in Europe is improving, the economic data is showing strength, corporate earnings are exceeding expectations,\u201d said       Robert Duggan,        partner at New York-based SkyBridge Capital, which invests $11.4 billion in funds. Mr. Duggan said that he\u00a0has been adding to holdings in funds that bet on European stock events and that some of these have gained 10% to 20% this year.Some investors who are optimistic on European shares and the euro say billionaire fund manager       Daniel Loeb\u2019s       move on             Nestl\u00e9 SA       is a fresh sign the Continent has become a prime destination for global investors.Mr. Loeb\u2019s Third Point hedge fund acquired a $3.5 billion stake in the Swiss food-and-cosmetics giant and demanded changes from it.\u201cWe are seeing more opportunities in Europe because of strong and improving economic data, a trend that will likely continue now that the French elections have passed without incident,\u201d Mr. Loeb wrote to investors in late April.Mr. Loeb added that \u201cwe have been more focused on improving global growth than on the \u2018      Trump       trade,\u2019 \u201d referring to the idea that certain investments would benefit from       Donald Trump\u2019s       election. His main hedge fund rose 9.9% through the end of May, a person who had seen the numbers said.Also profiting recently is       Chris Hohn\u2019s       European activist fund TCI, which has more than $20 billion in assets. Its main fund, which has a large allocation to Europe, is up around 23% this year through May with big bets on rising stock prices, said people who had seen the numbers.Among stocks to have fueled gains at TCI, which takes a small number of very concentrated bets, is Spanish airports operator Aena, which has risen 29% this year.Another hedge fund that has benefited from European investments is Lansdowne Partners, which has around $19 billion under management. Lansdowne has gained 15.6% in its European Equity fund this year, a person who had seen the numbers said, and 13.5% in its smaller Princay fund, which profited from buying French stocks that sold off around the time of the election.The gains are striking in a hedge-fund industry that is once again struggling to eke out returns. On average, hedge funds are up just 2.7% this year to June 29, according to Chicago-based data group HFR.\u2014Jon Sindreu contributed to this article.Write to Laurence Fletcher at laurence.fletcher@wsj.com and Gregory Zuckerman at gregory.zuckerman@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-04 05:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/many-hedge-funds-flock-to-europe-thinking-worst-is-over-1499160602", "news_title": "Hedge Funds Flock to Europe, Thinking Worst Is Over", "keywords": " bets, deals,europe, far right, hedge fund, mergers, returns, stock market, trump,Donald Trump,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics,elections,national,presidential elections,fund markets,commodity,financial market news,trusts,funds,financial vehicles,alternative investments,financial services,hedge funds,investing,securities"}, {"content": "Rising interest rates may help to cool off prices in the world\u2019s least affordable housing market, something the government\u2019s administrative measures have had little success in doing.Housing prices in Hong Kong have risen to record levels in recent months, defying efforts by the government to stem the tide of rising costs.But rising interest rates, sparked by recent moves by the U.S. Federal Reserve, may succeed where taxes and other government dampening measures have failed. And some experts are warning that if this happens, it might not be pretty.\u201cNormalization of U.S. interest rates will eventually raise the mortgage burden of Hong Kong borrowers, posing risks\u201d to the city\u2019s export-driven economy and housing market, said       Kevin Lam,             HSBC\u2019s       Greater China economist, in a research note.In Hong Kong, home resale prices rose on average 21% in May from a year earlier, exceeding the previous peak recorded a month earlier, according to the latest data available from Hong Kong\u2019s Rating and Valuation Department.The housing market has been mostly rising since the second half of 2016 after a small dip, as regulatory cooling measures seemed to only have a short-lived impact.\u201cHome prices have nearly tripled over the last decade and relative to incomes, are close to the highest on record,\u201d said       Chang Liu,        China economist at Capital Economics.One of the newest residential projects put out for sale was Park Yoho Genova, where the asking price of a 721-square-foot apartment is HKD$10.4 million, or HKD$14,429 ($1,850) a square foot. The average sales price of a residential property transacted in Manhattan in the first quarter was $1,778 a square foot, according to a report from Douglas Elliman.While these prices are comparable, housing is considered much less affordable in Hong Kong because incomes are so much lower. Indeed, for seven years Hong Kong has been ranked the least affordable city out of the 406 surveyed by Demographia, a think tank based in Belleville, Il.Hong Kong\u2019s housing crisis is one of the biggest causes of resentment in the region 20 years after its handover to Chinese rule. Housing prices remain high due to the city\u2019s large population, land shortages, speculation and ample money supply.Hong Kong also attracts demand from wealthy customers globally, and in recent years its housing prices have been driven up by an influx of newcomers from mainland China.To head off damaging property bubbles, the government implemented property cooling measures intermittently since 2009, including stamp duties\u2014which are essentially sales taxes\u2014and curbs on bank lending. The latest attempt was in May\u2014the Hong Kong Monetary Authority ordered banks to tighten credit assessments and cuts to the loan amounts banks can extend for properties.But many experts predict these new measures will be as unsuccessful as similar efforts in the past. Buyers in Hong Kong already face some of the most prohibitive rules about home purchases, including a regulation from the central bank requiring home buyers to fork out a minimum down payment of at least 40%. Banks also have to set aside more money as reserves against bad loans.Stamp duties have been raised to at least 15% to 30% for individuals and companies purchasing a residence, with some exceptions for permanent Hong Kong residents buying their first home.But over the years such property cooling measures only had a short term effect. They haven\u2019t been as effective as those in Singapore or Canada because of a chronic mismatch between demand and supply and the exploitation of loopholes in these measures, analysts said.For instance, cash-flushed property developers are helping customers skirt the central bank\u2019s minimum down payment measures by offering buyers credit so that they can make the down payment on new launches.\u201cThe authorities are not that determined to crack down on the housing market because it is not in their interest to do so,\u201d said Professor Ngai-Ming Yip, an urban studies expert at City University of Hong Kong. He pointed out that land premiums and stamp duties from property transactions make up a significant portion of government revenues.Hong Kong\u2019s real-estate market is affected by Federal Reserve policy because its currency is pegged to the U.S. dollar. The Fed\u2019s loose monetary policy since 2008 has been one of the causes for the low mortgage rates in Hong Kong.Lately the Fed has started to raise short-term rates and has laid the groundwork for shrinking its $4.5 trillion portfolio of bonds and other assets. Mortgage rates in Hong Kong have risen slightly in recent weeks after the authorities expanded risk management requirements for banks extending residential mortgages. But rates are generally still low compared with historical averages.But if rates rise it could have a major impact on the city\u2019s housing market because many mortgages have floating rates. Prices also would likely fall because buyers would be facing higher borrowing costs.The high prices are contributing to a housing shortage in this city of 7.3 million people that dwarfs comparable problems in other cities. Developers have been responding to the supply and demand imbalance by building tiny flats sometimes described as \u201cmosquito apartments.Many residents live in homes the size of a parking space while people with lower incomes live in cage homes the size of a bunk bed. These have resulted in numerous photo essays online depicting their cramped conditions.The lack of affordable housing options also contributed to discontent that fueled the pro-democracy protests in 2014, where supporters carried yellow umbrellas and blocked streets for weeks.\u201cMore and more Hong Kongers find it impossible to afford private housing, and are forced to join the queue for public ones,\u201d said       Joshua Wong,        a 20-year old pro-democracy activist, adding that the average wait time for a public housing unit is 4.6 years.He expressed skepticism that no matter how many public housing flats are built, the root of the housing problem will remain if the government doesn\u2019t improve its long-term planning and change its favorable policies toward developers.\u201cThe authoritarian rule together with the government\u2019s lack of empathy toward the society will only add fuel to the people\u2019s resentment,\u201d said Mr. Wong, who was arrested last week during a protest before the arrival of Chinese President       Xi Jinping.       He said he was released after 32 hours of detention.The government has pledged to increase the supply of affordable housing. It has promised an additional 94,500 public housing units to be built the coming four years, a higher rate of production than previous years. The stock of public housing flats rose 74,000 between 2006-2016, according to data from Hong Kong Housing Authority.\u201cPeople have to buy smaller and smaller apartments in Hong Kong at higher and higher prices,\u201d said       Vincent Cheung,        deputy managing director, valuation and advisory services at Colliers International.Write to Esther\u00a0Fung at esther.fung@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-04 05:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/rising-interest-rates-raise-uncertainties-for-hong-kongs-property-market-1499160601", "news_title": "Rising Interest Rates Raise Uncertainties for Hong Kong\u2019s Property Market", "keywords": "affordable housing,bursting,first-time home buyers,hk property report,hong kong housing prices,lack of housing,mortgages,property bubble,property report,small apartments,Federal Reserve,economic performance,indicators,home sales,housing affordability,monetary policy,interest rates,economic news,housing prices,real estate markets,political,general news,society,community,politics,international relations,domestic politics,social issues,welfare,social services"}, {"content": "HONG KONG\u2014On the 20th anniversary of this city\u2019s return to Chinese control, an iconic hotel at the heart of nightlife partying closed.Hotel LKF is perched on a hill above the late-night bars and dancing clubs on an L-shaped street known as       Lan Kwai Fong       in Hong Kong\u2019s Central district. The hotel operations in the 14-story building closed July 1 and much of it will be gutted over the next year to be turned into offices.\u201cThe hotel closing down, it\u2019s sad,\u201d said       Tony Yeung,        managing director of Peterson Group, a family-owned firm that owns the Hotel LKF building. \u201cI guess in a certain way, it was my baby. This was the first project I undertook.\u201dThe hotel\u2019s planned conversion to office space is another sign of how sensitive Hong Kong is to events on the mainland 20 years after the former British colony was handed over to the Chinese government.Just four years ago, a city task force said Hong Kong needed to nearly double its number of hotel rooms because of the rise in tourism, particularly from the mainland.But lately tourism has slumped partly because of antipathy expressed by residents toward visitors from the mainland. Chinese President       Xi Jinping\u2019s       antigraft campaign has also deterred them from visiting Hong Kong to buy luxury bags and watches. An appreciating U.S. dollar, which the Hong Kong dollar is pegged to, against the Chinese yuan over the past four years has also made their spending more expensive.Meanwhile, Chinese companies have been piling into Hong Kong and mainland developers are outbidding local real-estate tycoons for premium development sites. Chinese banks and other financial institutions have leased out high-end office space in the Central district.The upshot: Office space is looking a lot better to developers these days than hotel rooms. Hotels also have fallen from favor because it can take one decade or more before a developer might see profits. Offices generally go into the black in five years, and operating costs are lower.\u201cIt was a commercial-driven decision,\u201d Mr. Yeung said.At 12 years old, Hotel LKF needed touch-ups. The air-conditioning units were getting old, and the elevators needed to be upgraded. Occupancy was close to 90% but the average room rate had declined in the past four years, mirroring the Hong Kong hotel industry.Instead of spending money on renovations, Mr. Yeung decided it would be smarter to convert the building into offices for smaller companies such as creative agencies, small hedge funds and tech startups.Restaurants on the lower floors, including celebrity chef       Gordon Ramsay\u2019s       restaurant Bread Street Kitchen, will stay open during construction.Hotel-to-office conversions \u201cjust makes more sense,\u201d said Hong Kong business magnate       Allan Zeman,        the developer of many bars and properties near Lan Kwai Fong\u00a0street and the chairman of Lan Kwai Fong Group. He too had recently turned some serviced apartments into office space.But wouldn\u2019t new offices be a dud compared with the nightlife culture he helped cultivate? \u201cIt will actually not be a bad thing,\u201d Mr. Zeman said. Offices could bring young entrepreneurs, who will want to go out, he said.Other hotel owners are testing the office market.In the busy shopping district of Causeway Bay, the Excelsior may be going up for sale, said its owner,             Mandarin Oriental International.       But \u201cit would be premature to speculate on the outcome of the review at this time,\u201d Mandarin said in a written statement.The hotel, which was Hong Kong\u2019s largest at the time of its opening in 1973, sits at the cusp of the island waterfront where the roar of the nearby highway can be heard.Possible buyers could include cash-rich Chinese investors, and the new development could be a mix of offices and shops, said       Thomas Lam,        head of valuations and consultancy at       Knight Frank.       Mr. Lam estimates that more small hotels will be sold and converted into offices in the next two to three years.In another part of the district, the owner of the hotel Crowne Plaza Hong Kong Causeway Bay has applied to Hong Kong\u2019s Town Planning Board to demolish the 29-story building and build a 22-story building of mostly office space, with shops and restaurants on the lower five floors, according to application documents.Keith Chau,        a spokesman for the Crowne Plaza\u2019s owner, SEA Group, didn\u2019t respond to multiple requests for comment.As for Mr. Yeung, who is overseeing Hotel LKF\u2019s conversion, he understands that as Hong Kong culture and identity transforms, so must his business.\u201cIt\u2019s all part of evolving,\u201d Mr. Yeung said. \u201cEverything needs to be changed.\u201dWrite to Dominique Fong at Dominique.Fong@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-04 05:30:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/hotels-are-out-offices-are-in-with-hong-kong-developers-1499160603", "news_title": "Hotels Are Out, Offices Are In With Hong Kong Developers", "keywords": " hk property report,property reporter,capacity,facilities,corporate,industrial news,facility closures,political,general news,living,lifestyle,travel,leisure,arts,hospitality,tourism"}, {"content": "When U.K. law firm Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP signed a lease earlier this year for office space outside Hong Kong\u2019s main business district, it turned heads.Cost-conscious U.S. and European financial firms for years have been leaving the financial district known as Central, the world\u2019s most expensive office market, for other neighborhoods. But Freshfields will be the first major international law firm to\u00a0say goodbye.A big part of the decision came down to cost: renting quality office space under 5 miles away is less than half the price.\u201cWhen Freshfields moved out, that was a game changer,\u201d said       Denis Ma,        head of Hong Kong research at property broker JLL.In cities around the world, firms are often willing to pay a premium for office addresses that give them a level of prestige and easy access to clients. But in Hong Kong, the increasing divergence between soaring rents in Central and suburban business districts is forcing even the most traditional firms to reconsider their\u00a0choice of\u00a0real estate.Even with the departures, office-space demand in Central remains strong thanks to mainland Chinese firms willing to pay the premium, brokers say.\u201cChinese firms bumping up the rents in Central have given [international firms] the nudge,\u201d Mr. Ma said.Leasing office space in Central cost around 128 Hong Kong dollars (about $16) a square foot a month in June, up more than 6% from the same period last year, according to real-estate broker CBRE. It is still below the prefinancial crisis record of 137 Hong Kong dollars a square foot a month.Freshfields in December will move into a glass skyscraper in Hong Kong East, another urban district of high-rise buildings across the harbor. Rents there are 49 Hong Kong dollars a square foot a month, on par with last year, CBRE data show.New York-based asset manager Alliance Bernstein is planning to move into the same tower, One Island East.In April, Chinese companies accounted for over half of the new leases in Central, according to JLL.\u201cThey\u2019ve been essentially propping up the market,\u201d Mr. Ma said.Offices in Hong Kong\u2019s central district were the most expensive in the world last year, according to broker CBRE.\u00a0Annual prime rents were nearly double those in London\u2019s West End and Midtown Manhattan, which were fifth and sixth on CBRE\u2019s global list.And rents in Central are still rising. While overall Hong Kong rents will remain flat in 2017, they are expected to increase up to 10% in Central because of \u201cpent up demand from mainland firms opening up offices in Hong Kong and very low vacancy rates,\u201d said       Tom Gaffney,        managing director of Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan at CBRE.The vacancy rate in the central district was 1.8% in June, in line with a year earlier, and compared with an average 4.7% throughout the Hong Kong districts, Mr. Gaffney said.While Chinese companies are willing to pay the premium to be in Central, \u201cfor everyone else, rents are going up at the wrong time,\u201d Mr. Ma said.U.S. and European firms have been looking to cut costs amid the low world-wide economic growth\u00a0that has persisted through the recovery following the financial crisis of\u00a0nearly a decade ago. Global banking groups were among the first to decamp from central Hong Kong.Bank of America                   Merrill Lynch,             Barclays,       and             Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale                   have all stepped back from central Hong Kong in recent years. Insurance companies also have expanded into suburban markets.The legal firms have largely stuck to the central district, where many large corporate clients remain based.That is changing. This year \u201cshould be a turning point for Hong Kong\u2019s office market following the relocation of several legal firms away from Central,\u201d said Yasas Wickramasinghe, senior analyst at broker Colliers International in Hong Kong.Smaller law firms have moved out of Central in the past, but the market took more notice of Freshfields\u2019s move because it is\u00a0a major player in the legal world.\u00a0It is part\u00a0of the so-called magic circle, a term used to describe five major London-based law firms.Much lower rents outside Central \u201cwas clearly part of our decision making,\u201d said       William Robinson,        managing partner of Freshfields\u2019s Hong Kong office. The availability of quality space in the right location for staff was an equally important factor, he said.But Freshfields isn\u2019t completely abandoning Central, where it has been a tenant in Two Exchange Square for three decades.

The month-to-month decline was larger than the 0.1% fall expected by economists who were surveyed by The Wall Street Journal.The fall in prices at the factory gates is in line with other signs that consumer-price inflation is set to continue to remain modest over coming months, having briefly touched the European Central Bank\u2019s target as energy prices rose in the early months of the year.Figures released Friday showed the annual rate of consumer-price inflation fell to 1.3% in June, its lowest level this year.Much of the variation in the inflation rate over recent years has been due to energy, with prices of other goods and services raising at a largely unchanged pace that has been well below the ECB\u2019s target of just under 2%.That pattern was repeated at the factory gates in May, with energy prices falling 1.3% from April, while the prices of other goods were unchanged.The eurozone\u2019s strengthening economic recovery has prompted some ECB policy makers to question whether its stimulus measures should be maintained at their current settings.Write to Paul Hannon at paul.hannon@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-04 05:00:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/eurozone-producer-prices-fell-in-may-1499158806", "news_title": "Eurozone Producer Prices Fell in May", "keywords": "economic performance,indicators,inflation,prices,industrial production,euro zone,currency,economic news,producer price index,energy"}, {"content": "SEOUL\u2014South Korea\u2019s             Samsung                         business empire makes hundreds of deals each year. But an obscure $18.6 million equestrian agreement it signed two years ago to fund a company in Germany could upend a decadeslong succession process at the conglomerate.Samsung               heir Lee Jae-yong was arrested in February, and is on trial over his alleged role in a corruption scandal that led to former South Korean president Park Geun-hye\u2019s impeachment. Three months into the trial, the prosecutors\u2019 criminal case is riding on what they describe as a form of horse-trading: an effort by         Samsung               to channel money for political favors by funding the equestrian aspirations of the daughter of a close friend of the country\u2019s former president.The prosecution\u2019s case centers on the funding of Core Sports International GmbH, a small German sports-consulting company prosecutors say was controlled by Ms. Park\u2019s close friend,       Choi Soon-sil.       Core Sports had just one client: Ms. Choi\u2019s daughter, Chung Yoo-ra, an equestrian athlete.Samsung\u2019s       Mr. Lee is accused of having ordered his company to fund Core Sports. In return, prosecutors allege Ms. Choi colluded with Ms. Park to have the then-president direct the country\u2019s pension service to vote in favor of a 2015 merger of two Samsung affiliates that was seen as a critical step in consolidating Mr. Lee\u2019s grip on         Samsung Electronics Co.      , the world\u2019s biggest smartphone maker.Prosecutors say they believe they have enough evidence to show         Samsung\u2019s       equestrian sponsorship constitutes bribery. \u201cThe equestrian support was for one person, Chung Yoo-ra,\u201d said special prosecutor Park Young-soo, at April\u2019s opening hearing.Mr. Lee\u2019s defense attorneys have acknowledged         Samsung\u2019s       sponsorship of the German company, but denied the funds were intended to benefit a specific person.\u201c        Samsung               did not pay any bribes and did not make any improper requests or seek favors. We believe that the court proceedings will reveal the truth,\u201d said a Samsung spokeswoman, reiterating an earlier statement.Prosecutors have so far put forward 10 witnesses, thousands of pages of emails, text messages and phone records to detail how Samsung\u2019s equestrian sponsorship was allegedly a coverup for channeling funds to Ms. Choi and Ms. Chung for over 10 months.Ms. Park was removed from office in March by the country\u2019s Constitutional Court, following her impeachment over accusations that she colluded with Ms. Choi to extort money from Samsung and other South Korean conglomerates. Ms. Park and Mr. Lee have both denied wrongdoing.Mr. Lee\u2019s lawyers have rejected all allegations against Mr. Lee in court. \u201cSamsung\u2019s business activities were not a part of Mr. Lee\u2019s succession plan, but regular business activities,\u201d said Song Wu-cheol, one of Mr. Lee\u2019s lawyers at a hearing, adding that Samsung sponsored the equestrian training at Ms. Park\u2019s request \u201cwith no strings attached.\u201d Mr. Lee has yet to testify in court but at a parliamentary hearing in December, he denied asking the government to support the merger.Ms. Choi was arrested last year and has been indicted on multiple criminal charges, including bribery and abuse of power; her trial continues. Both Ms. Choi and Ms. Chung have denied wrongdoing. Ms. Choi\u2019s lawyer rejected the bribery charge in another trial involving Ms. Choi and Ms. Park. Ms. Choi\u2019s lawyers didn\u2019t respond to several requests for comment.A conviction of Mr. Lee could boost the prosecutors\u2019 case against Ms. Park, who also faces several charges centering around bribery. It would also throw into question a succession process at Samsung when it is seeking growth in new fields such as biologic drugs and automotive parts.Mr. Lee, 49, has been the de facto heir of South Korea\u2019s largest conglomerate since his father, Samsung Electronics Chairman Lee Kun-hee, became incapacitated after a heart attack in 2014. Samsung declined to comment on the succession situation.The younger Mr. Lee is in custody and has been absent from his role as the vice chairman of Samsung Electronics since February, when he was arrested. Under South Korean law, he can be detained until the end of August without a verdict, which can be extended. If convicted, he can face at least five years in prison.South Korea has seen cases of conglomerate heads managing companies from behind bars. While Mr. Lee\u2019s absence won\u2019t immediately affect the company\u2019s business performance, it may complicate decision-making, said Chung Sun-seop, the head of Chaebul.com, a corporate-governance research firm in Seoul.The prosecutors\u2019 case stretches back to August 2015, shortly after South Korea\u2019s National Pension Service\u2014then the biggest shareholder in         Samsung C&T Corp.      , one of the Samsung affiliates in the 2015 merger\u2014cast a decisive vote in favor of the merger, ensuring its approval. That deal, which strengthened Mr. Lee\u2019s control over Samsung Electronics, was opposed by many foreign investors and proxy advisory firms Glass Lewis & Co. and Institutional Shareholder Services Inc., which regarded it as detrimental to Samsung C&T shareholders. Last month, the court sentenced two former South Korean officials tied to NPS each with a 2\u00bd year prison term for abuse of power and embezzlement in connection with the merger. The two officials have appealed the verdict to a higher court.A spokesman at NPS declined to comment for this article. In December, before prosecutors began investigating the pension fund, NPS said it had voted in favor of the merger \u201cin the view of improving the fund\u2019s long-term profit following careful review.\u201dWeeks later, on Aug. 26, Samsung Electronics officials met with Core Sports employees at Frankfurt\u2019s Intercontinental Hotel to sign a contract promising the consulting company $18.6 million over a three-year period to train South Korean athletes for the 2018 Asian Games and the World Equestrian Games, according to witnesses questioned during the trial. Ms. Choi was in the lobby of the hotel during the signing, witnesses said.Under the agreement, Core Sports would use the funds to buy 12 horses and support six athletes, as well as a number of \u00a0coaches, trainers, team managers and horse managers, according to a copy of the contract reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.But Core Sports was ill-equipped to carry out conditions of the deal at the time. The company was registered only a day before its deal with Samsung, according to a German commercial registration document presented by prosecutors in court.Park Sung-kwan, a Germany-based lawyer and one of Core Sports\u2019 co-signees for the contract between the German company and Samsung, declined to comment citing attorney-client privilege.Park Won-oh, a former official at the Korea Equestrian Federation, said the company had only one employee with relevant equestrian experience. But Core Sports paid monthly salaries to Ms. Chung\u2019s husband and a friend who watched her pets and ran small household errands, testified another witness who briefly managed the company\u2019s accounting.The prosecutors\u2019 case has rested heavily on testimony of Mr. Park, the 67-year-old former equestrian official and no relation to Ms. Park. He was also contracted by Samsung to advise the company on equestrian matters.In his testimony, Mr. Park described how he worked with Samsung and the equestrian federation to devise a training plan that became the backbone for Samsung\u2019s sponsorship deal with Core Sports. Mr. Park testified that he went over the contract conditions with Ms. Choi and then relayed her demands back to Samsung.Mr. Park testified at a court hearing that Samsung appeared to \u201clet Choi Soon-sil do what she wanted\u2014almost 100%.\u201dMr. Park said he was perplexed at the time by why a company as large and powerful as Samsung would be so pliable to Ms. Choi\u2019s demands, even when it was \u201cdoubtful\u201d that Core Sports had the capacity to train Ms. Chung at the time of the agreement.Mr. Lee\u2019s defense lawyers and some witnesses said that Samsung intended for the dressage training project to support more than one athlete, but was prevented from doing so by Ms. Choi.Ms. Choi\u2019s lawyer didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. Last week, Ms. Choi delayed taking the witness stand at Mr. Lee\u2019s trial, citing health issues. Ms. Chung said she had no knowledge of what went on between her mother and Ms. Park. \u201cMy mother said that I would be one of the athletes out of six funded by Samsung Electronics,\u201d Ms. Chung told reporters in May.Prosecutors are expected to complete witness examinations in the coming weeks, after which defense lawyers can call witnesses to the stand.", "news_time": "2017-07-04 04:29:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/case-against-samsung-heir-rides-on-alleged-horse-trading-deal-1499088469", "news_title": "His Kingdom for a Horse?

The numbers are in line with analyses from U.S., South Korean and Japanese military authorities.North Korean leader       Kim Jong Un       said earlier this year that the country was close to test-launching an ICBM. U.S. President       Donald Trump       said on Twitter a day later: \u201cIt won\u2019t happen!\u201dA North Korean ICBM could change the strategic calculus between Washington and Pyongyang, as Mr. Kim\u2019s regime continues to defy United Nations sanctions and warnings from its neighbors to curb its nuclear and weapons programs.Since the rise of Mr. Kim, the North\u2019s third-generation leader, in 2011, Pyongyang has accelerated missile development, both increasing range and reducing preparation time\u2014making a launch more difficult to detect in advance and stop.The U.S., which has roughly 28,500 troops in South Korea, has weighed military options against North Korea since at least the early 1990s, but appears to have decided each time that it was too risky. North Korean has amassed artillery that can reach Seoul, the South Korean capital, just 35 miles south of the border. An ICBM that could put the continental U.S. in danger would raise the stakes.Hours after the launch, Pyongyang\u2019s official Korean Central News Agency declared the missile an ICBM and said that its missiles and nuclear weapons are capable of ending what it called \u201cthe U.S. nuclear war threat.\u201dLike some other recent North Korean launches, the latest one took a steep trajectory, which prevents missiles from flying over neighboring countries like Japan, as some earlier tests did. The U.S. Pacific Command in Hawaii identified the latest as an intermediate-range ballistic missile, generally meaning a range of 3,000 to 5,500 kilometers (1,860 to 3,410 miles). But David Wright, a physicist at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said that if fired at a more-standard trajectory, it could have flown for more than 4,160 miles. That\u2019s far enough to qualify as an ICBM.The distinction between an intermediate-range and intercontinental ballistic missile is important: The U.S. has forbidden ICBM tests by North Korea, though it is unclear how it will respond to Pyongyang\u2019s claim that it has carried one out.On Tuesday, before North Korea\u2019s ICBM claim, Mr. Trump tweeted: \u201cNorth Korea has just launched another missile. Does this guy have anything better to do with his life? Hard to believe that South Korea and Japan will put up with this much longer. Perhaps China will put a heavy move on North Korea and end this nonsense once and for all!\u201dEven armed with an ICBM, North Korea would need a warhead it can carry and detonate at a predetermined target. North Korea has said it has developed a nuclear bomb small enough to mount on a long-range missile, but opinion among outside experts is divided.Markus Schiller, a missile expert with German space and defense consultancy ST Analytics GmbH, said North Korea likely faces several years of engineering.\u201cTheir work is just starting,\u201d he said.During an emergency meeting of South Korea\u2019s National Security Council on Tuesday, President Moon Jae-in called for more U.N. Security Council measures against North Korea. He had met just days earlier with Mr. Trump in Washington, where they urged North Korea to refrain from provocations.At a regular Chinese Foreign Ministry briefing Tuesday, spokesman Geng Shuang reiterated Beijing\u2019s position that it opposes any North Korean violations of U.N. Security Council resolutions. As for Mr. Trump\u2019s tweets, Mr. Geng said China has worked tirelessly for stability on the Korean Peninsula.\u201cChina\u2019s efforts are obvious to all,\u201d he added.Mr. Trump is expected to press Chinese leader       Xi Jinping       for more help in curtailing Pyongyang\u2019s weapons program at this week\u2019s Group of 20 summit in Germany. Japanese Prime Minister       Shinzo Abe       said Tuesday that he would seek coordination on North Korea with other global leaders at the summit.\u201cThis missile launch clearly shows the threat is increasing further,\u201d he told reporters.Satellite imagery released late last month by 38 North, a blog published by the U.S.-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins University\u2019s School of Advanced International Studies, showed that North Korea had tested a rocket engine that some analysts believe could be used for an ICBM.Japanese government spokesman Yoshihide Suga said the latest missile appeared to land in Japan\u2019s maritime exclusive economic zone, which extends about 200 nautical miles from the coast. Last year, North Korea fired four missiles that landed in Japan\u2019s EEZ.The launch, which took place at 9:10 a.m. Pyongyang time from Banghyon, north of the capital, was Pyongyang\u2019s first in more than a month.North Korea has test-launched missiles on or around July 4 before, including in 2006 and 2009.North Korea has launched 13 ballistic missiles this year, more than at this point in the previous three years, according to Shea Cotton, a research associate at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in Monterey, Calif.Its previous launch, in early June, was with multiple cruise missiles rather than a ballistic missile, which leaves the atmosphere. It last launched a ballistic missile in late May. Like Tuesday\u2019s missile, it landed in the waters between Japan and Korea.\u2014Alastair Gale in Tokyo, Lingling Wei in Beijing and Kwanwoo Jun and Min Sun Lee in Seoul contributed to this article.Write to Jonathan Cheng at jonathan.cheng@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-04 03:52:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/north-korea-launches-missile-into-waters-between-korea-and-japan-1499131848", "news_title": "North Korea Says It Successfully Test-Fired an ICBM ", "keywords": "donald trump ,kim jong un ,northkoreacarousel,north korea missile ,north korea missile launch ,the korean peninsula ,U.N.

But the big swing back to bullishness also looks premature.The main factor driving prices back higher is the long-expected slowdown in U.S. supply growth: the number of active oil rigs in the U.S. ticked down\u2014by two, out of a total of over 750\u2014for the first time since January last week, and oil output dipped in late June too.Oil watchers have been waiting for falling prices to finally take some of the steam out of U.S. shale. But while the overall oil and gas rig count ticked down in Alaska and Colorado last week, it actually rose in Texas, the real heart of the shale monster.There are good reasons why a collapse in supply is unlikely. To begin with, the big rebound in shale production this year, while enough to give OPEC a headache, has been relatively cautious. There are many more oil rigs in play now than a year ago, but still only half the peak of 1,600 in late 2014. Drillers have improved their technology and been more selective about where to drill.One of the big attractions of shale is that supply can be dialed up and down relatively quickly, because shale wells only produce large amounts of oil for a short time, unlike conventional wells. That should mean it\u2019s more difficult for oil prices to overshoot either on the up or downside. And despite the volatility of the past few months, prices have failed to break out the $40 to $60 a barrel range: roughly where analysts believe most shale plays are now profitable.If oil heads higher, it will elicit a quick supply response\u2014same on the downside. Nothing in the past six weeks has done much to change that equation.Write to Nathaniel Taplin at nathaniel.taplin@wsj.com", "news_time": "2017-07-04 03:43:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/behind-oils-ups-and-downs-little-has-changed-1499154232", "news_title": "Behind Oil\u2019s Ups and Downs, Little Has Changed", "keywords": "heard on the street, oil prices, opec, shale producers,commodity markets,energy markets,commodity,financial market news,crude oil markets"}, {"content": "SEOUL\u2014            Samsung Electronics Co.             is developing a voice-activated speaker powered by its digital assistant Bixby, according to people familiar with the matter, joining a proliferating arms race in tabletop devices.The timing is far from determined, the people said. The English-language version of Bixby has been delayed and they said many of the speaker\u2019s features and other specifications are yet to be decided. But the project\u2014internally code-named \u201cVega\u201d\u2014has been going on for more than a year, several of the people said.Should a Samsung speaker hit the market, the South Korean tech giant would face the likes of         Amazon.com Inc.,Alphabet Inc.       and         Microsoft Corp.       in a race to create and install such speakers to eventually run internet-connected homes, cars and offices\u2014from turning off lights to adjusting the thermostat.To Silicon Valley, voice-activated speakers are more about big data than big bucks. The ultimate payoff is advancing voice-activated artificial-intelligence technology. The virtual assistants, like Amazon\u2019s Alexa,         Apple Inc.\u2019s       Siri and Bixby, improve with use\u2014the software learning from mistakes\u2014industry executives say.Amazon\u2019s Echo has captured more than 70% of the U.S. market for voice-activated speakers, with Alphabet\u2019s Google Home next at around 24%, according to eMarketer, a market-research firm. The number of Americans using such speakers at least once a month will reach about 36 million this year, eMarketer said, double last year\u2019s figure.Microsoft has introduced a voice-controlled speaker, Invoke, that can make phone calls, for release in the fall, and Apple is preparing to release its HomePod device in December. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. also plans to introduce a device powered by voice-recognition technology, that will be targeted at Chinese consumers.Microsoft\u2019s speaker, which uses its digital assistant Cortana, is the product of an alliance with audio pioneer Harman International Industries Inc., newly acquired by Samsung. The alliance predates the March closing of that $8 billion deal, according to people familiar with the matter.One variable slowing Samsung\u2019s progress is the postponed U.S. launch of the English-language version of Bixby, which would operate the speaker much as Alexa operates Amazon\u2019s Echo device, according to people familiar with the matter. Bixby\u2019s voice features were a key selling point for the world\u2019s largest smartphone maker\u2019s latest flagship model, the Galaxy S8, introduced April 21.The company vowed the English-language Bixby would be ready by spring, but now Samsung internally believes those voice features are unlikely before the second half of July, one of the people said. The Galaxy S8 is Samsung\u2019s first device to feature Bixby.A Samsung spokeswoman said the company doesn\u2019t comment on rumors and speculation.Vega is only the latest of Samsung\u2019s speaker projects, which go back years, according to people familiar with the matter. The company had once planned to debut one code-named \u201cHive\u201d in March 2015 at the Mobile World Congress in Spain, the people said, but it was quietly shelved over software issues including problems with voice recognition.The Vega project could end the same way, though that is unlikely, the people said.Bixby voice is available in Samsung\u2019s home country, but the English language version has faced hurdles. It is being piloted in an \u201cearly access\u201d program with tens of thousands of U.S. consumers, according to people familiar with the matter. The timing of its U.S. launch has been in flux and could still be altered again, the people said.Samsung views Bixby as a potential game-changer. It dedicated a button on the Galaxy S8\u2019s side to the virtual assistant, while extolling its \u201cintelligent interface and contextual awareness.\u201d Executives foresee its use in Samsung\u2019s broader suite of products, such as home appliances and automobile software.Write to Timothy W.

Neither the satellite nor the rocket appeared to be damaged, but industry reaction to the twin aborts will depend partly on the explanation SpaceX officials provide.The launch won\u2019t take place before Wednesday, Mr. Musk said via             Twitter,       while the company conducts a \u201cfull review\u201d of rocket and launchpad systems. \u201cOnly one chance to get it right,\u201d the SpaceX founder said.Monday\u2019s events surprised some industry officials partly because prior to the latest scrub SpaceX indicated it had fixed the computer issue behind Sunday\u2019s problems. Moreover, SpaceX\u2019s recent launches, stretching back to January, generally have played out without any countdown delays or technical glitches requiring resolution.The nearly 15,000-pound satellite, believed to be the heaviest payload SpaceX has ever tried to launch, would have required the full thrust and all of the fuel loaded on board SpaceX\u2019s Falcon 9 rocket to reach its desired orbit. So in this case, there were no plans to bring the main part of the rocket back.Reusing rockets and even unmanned cargo capsules, however, has now become part of SpaceX\u2019s everyday operations, with commercial customers lining up to put satellites on top of what the company calls \u201cflight tested\u201d main stages. Pentagon officials also are talking more favorably about the prospect of contracting to put national-security payloads on top of reused rockets, perhaps sometime in the next few years.The aim of reusing boosters is to lower costs and speed up launches, though the practice also provides SpaceX somewhat of a respite from having to manufacture boosters at a breakneck pace to meet its launch commitments.Last week, Claire Leon, who heads the Air Force\u2019s launch directorate, told reporters, \u201cit\u2019s going to take a little more time\u201d for Pentagon brass to become comfortable contracting for reused rockets. She said the military intends to further study the issue but the hope is \u201cto move in that direction.\u201dAfter the Intelsat launch, one of the company\u2019s next big challenges in coming months will be to start flying what it has described as the final variant of its Falcon 9 family of launchers, a design optimized for reusing the main part of the rocket along with its nine engines.Also later this year, SpaceX\u2019s management team intends to carry out the maiden launch of the company\u2019s Falcon Heavy, a beefed-up derivative of the Falcon 9, which is several years delayed and features 27 separate main engines.Over the years, SpaceX has talked about its automated pre-launch abort system and related design features of the Falcon 9 as important safety enhancements to traditional rocketry. Immediately after the main engines ignite, for example, mechanical arms restrain the Falcon 9 and prevent it from starting to rise for a fleeting instant, to ensure everything is operating normally.The company also has stressed that the Falcon 9 can afford to lose thrust from one of its nine main engines, or in some circumstance even two, and still deliver payload to space. More recently, SpaceX and the Air Force have worked together to use an automated system\u2014rather than relying on human intervention\u2014to instantly destroy a faulty rocket if it is seriously off course or threatens to cause damage on the ground.Write to Andy Pasztor at andy.pasztor@wsj.comAppeared in the July 5, 2017, print edition as 'SpaceX Pauses After Two Setbacks.'", "news_time": "2017-07-04 02:36:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/spacex-scraps-launch-for-second-time-in-two-days-1499132639", "news_title": "SpaceX Scraps Launch for Second Time in Two Days", "keywords": "abort,falcon 9,intelsat,launch,satellite,vc industry news,Intelsat,I,SpaceX,Elon Musk,new products,services,corporate,industrial news,political,general news,sciences,humanities,space exploration,travel,aerospace products,parts,satellites,space vehicles,aerospace,defense,industrial goods,technology"}, {"content": "Maine lawmakers passed a compromise state budget early Tuesday, ending a standoff that caused the state\u2019s first government shutdown in 26 years.After negotiating all of Monday, the third day of the partial government shutdown, lawmakers cheered close to 1 a.m. as they approved a two-year $7.1 billion budget with bipartisan votes. Legislators sent the bill to Republican Gov. Paul LePage, who promptly signed it and said the government would resume normal operations.\u201cThe Maine state government shutdown is now over. Happy Fourth of July!\u201d Mr. LePage wrote in a Twitter post.The budget battle in the Pine Tree State, where the legislature is closely split between Democrats and Republicans, centered on taxes and education.The compromise budget removed a 1.5% increase in the state\u2019s lodging tax that had been the final sticking point for Mr. LePage and House Republicans.In return, Democratic leaders said they secured an increased investment in Head Start early-childhood programs as well as a moratorium on cuts to reimbursement rates for behavioral health services.\u201cThis unnecessary shutdown needed to come to an end,\u201d Maine House Speaker Sara Gideon, a Democrat, said in a statement, adding that ultimately, \u201cwe were able to close a budget that makes the largest investment in public education in our state\u2019s history.\u201dThe budget deal also repealed a 3% tax on annual household income above $200,000\u2014as lawmakers had already agreed to do in an early compromise. Voters backed a November referendum on the tax to raise funds for education.Mr. LePage said in a statement: \u201cI thank legislators for doing the right thing by passing a budget that does not increase taxes on the Maine people.\u201dIt has been a contentious budget-making season in many states, and both Maine and New Jersey shut down parts of their governments because lawmakers couldn\u2019t reach accords in time for the start of the new fiscal year Saturday. New Jersey\u2019s government was poised to reopen Tuesday after Republican Gov. Chris Christie reached a budget deal late Monday with Democratic lawmakers.During the shutdown in Maine, emergency services continued, as did many other operations, including state parks, unemployment benefits and child welfare.Still, the standoff led to the temporarily closing of the Maine State Aquarium, half of the state\u2019s 36 courthouses, motor-vehicle branches and the lottery\u2014and sidelined thousands of state employees.Hundreds of the workers marched and protested at the State House on Monday, holding signs\u2014messages included, \u201cDo your job!\u201d\u2014to urge passage of the budget, according to photos posted on             Twitter.Write to Jennifer Levitz at jennifer.levitz@wsj.comAppeared in the July 5, 2017, print edition as 'In Maine, Lawmakers Reach Deal Brings End To Shutdown.'", "news_time": "2017-07-04 02:29:00", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/maines-government-shutdown-ends-after-budget-deal-reached-1499149750", "news_title": "Maine\u2019s Government Shutdown Ends After Budget Deal Reached ", "keywords": " budget, democratics, gop, governmore, lepage,maine, over governement, republicans, shutdown, standoff, state,economic performance,indicators,budget account,government finance,government budget,taxation,economic news,political,general news,politics,international relations,domestic politics"}]
