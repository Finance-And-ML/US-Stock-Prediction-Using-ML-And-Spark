U.S. officials told Reuters last month that the U.S. military carried out the air strike against militia supported by the government of President Bashar al-Assad which it said posed a threat to U.S. forces and U.S.-backed Syrian fighters in the country's south. Russia said at the time that the U.S. action would hamper efforts to find a political solution to the conflict and had violated the sovereignty of Syria, one of Russia's closest Middle East allies.  Lavrov expressed his categorical disagreement with the U.S. strikes on pro-government forces and called on him to take concrete measures to prevent similar incidents in future,  the ministry said.  The two men had also exchanged assessments of the situation in Syria, it added, and confirmed their desire to step up co-operation to try to end the conflict there.    The ministry said Lavrov and Tillerson had also discussed the need to try to mend the rift between Qatar and other Arab nations through negotiations, and had talked about the state of U.S.-Russia relations and planned meetings between officials from the two countries.

In the case of the Stanley Cup Final, the first road win will spell the end of the series. The defending champion Pittsburgh Penguins can become the first team to repeat since Detroit in 1998 if they can crack the code of raucous Bridgestone Arena Sunday night in Game 6 against the Nashville Predators.  We're just going to try to stay in the moment regardless of whether it needs to be played,  Pittsburgh coach Mike Sullivan said.  We're going to try to play the game that gives us the best chance to win.  That game looks a whole lot like Game 5, in which the Penguins ambushed Nashville early and often, scoring six goals in the first two periods and netting a contentious 6-0 win that gave them a 3-2 series lead. It looks nothing like Games 1 through 4, in which the Predators controlled the flow of play most of the time. While Pittsburgh created really good scoring chances in the first two periods of Game 4, it was still outshot in each of the first four games, sometimes by a lot in terms of total shots. Nashville looked nothing like that team Thursday night, instead imitating deer frozen by headlights. Goalie Pekka Rinne lasted one period, undone by poor defense in front of him and the relentless Penguins attack. During the 72-hour break between Games 2 and 3, Predators coach Peter Laviolette was asked repeatedly if he intended to bench Rinne. That line of questioning has been squashed during this 72-hour hiatus, in part because Laviolette wouldn't entertain it, and also because Rinne has simply been so dominant at home. He's 9-1 in this year's playoffs at Bridgestone Arena, ceding just 15 goals and often standing on his head with spectacular saves like the ones he made in Game 4 that led Nashville to a 4-1 victory.  He's the same every day,  Laviolette said of Rinne.  He works hard every day. His demeanor seems the same to me. We've got to do a better job in front of him. I know there's things we can do that can support our goaltender better.  One thing can be accomplished simply by playing at home. In addition to the deafening crowd that seems to act as an extra skater, wearing the gold uniforms gives the Predators the final change. That allows Laviolette to use his top defense pairings more in faceoff situations to better counter the likes of Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin. But what if Nashville's Big Four defensively becomes a Big Three? Ryan Ellis, who left Game 5 in the second period with an undisclosed injury, didn't practice on Saturday. If he's not able to go, Roman Josi, P.K. Subban and Mattias Ekholm may have to soak up extra minutes. Regardless, the Predators will be a formidable foe on friendly ice, especially now that they're in win-or-else mode. No one knows that better than the team trying to knock them out.  We have to approach it like the team that's playing for its life tomorrow,  defenseman Ron Hainsey said.  Everybody's focus will be on getting off to a real good start because if we don't, it could be a rough night. ","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-icehockey-nhl-stanleycup-idUSKBN19202A"},

FLC's board decided in May to set up the new airline, called Bamboo Airways.     The new carrier will have a fleet of  about seven  aircraft by 2018, and its first flight could take place in early 2018, said Trinh Van Quyet, chairman of FLC Group.    By 2018, it will be about seven...and the number would be increasing in the year after. We are now working with Airbus,  Quyet told Reuters in an interview on the sidelines of a company road show in Singapore, adding they would be on lease.  That carrier will serve our resorts in nine provinces in Vietnam. We will connect with international flights and we will carry them to our resorts,  he said.  Vietnam now has four airlines -- Vietnam Airlines, Vietjet Aviation, Jetstar Pacific Airlines and Vietnam Air Services Co.  An executive gives a presentation at a FLC Group event in Singapore June 10, 2017.Edgar SuFLC said in March it won provincial approval for a study to invest $2 billion in an entertainment complex in northern Quang Ninh province that could include resorts, hotels, a casino and golf course, among other services. FLC plans to invest about $2.1 billion on the project, Quyet said. The provincial government has already suggested a location for the resort, which includes a casino, he added.  We are working on the master plan now, and we are clearing the land,  Quyet said, adding that it covered 1,700 hectares (4,200 acres). FLC is part of a growing number of foreign and domestic investors betting on Vietnam's decision to allow citizens entry to its casinos, a lucrative market locked for years in a nation of passionate, yet clandestine gamblers on cards and soccer. From mid-March, Vietnamese have been allowed to gamble in approved casinos and under certain conditions in a three-year pilot project announced in January. The government will review whether to retain the policy after three years. There are fewer than 10 casinos in the country, all barred to Vietnamese. The change could make Vietnam an attractive destination for big gaming companies such as Las Vegas Sands, Genting Bhd, Nagacorp  and Penn National Gaming, which have expressed interest.

West, who was so closely identified with Batman for the rest of his life that it was both a blessing and a curse for him, died on Friday evening after a short struggle with leukemia, his representative told Variety.   He was the greatest. We'll miss him like crazy,  his family said on the actor's Twitter page.  The live-action  Batman  show, starring West along with Burt Ward as his sidekick Robin and a collection of colorful villains, was inspired by a long-running comic book series. It ran only three seasons from 1966 to 1968 on the ABC network, but became a television phenomenon and cult classic. It also spawned a  Batman  feature film in 1966. West portrayed Batman and his alter ego Bruce Wayne as painfully earnest, straight-laced, clean-cut and trustworthy. The darker aspects of the Batman character - mined so successfully in later film versions - were ignored. The show's various memorable villains - Cesar Romero as the Joker, Frank Gorshin as the Riddler, Burgess Meredith as the Penguin and Julie Newmar as Catwoman - were allowed to chew the scenery. Numerous Hollywood luminaries stepped in to play Batman's demented adversaries in the show's 120 episodes.  He was bright, witty and fun to work with,  Newmar said on Saturday in a statement.  I will miss him in the physical world and savor him always in the world of imagination and creativity.        After the cancellation of the series, West found it difficult to land other acting jobs, even though he was an established film and TV actor, because he had become so linked to the Batman role. Eventually he came to accept that his identity was closely intertwined with the masked crime-fighting hero in the black cape whether he liked it or not. He often was hired to play a comically fictionalized version of himself in live-action and animated roles and became a successful voice actor. On the long-running animated series  Family Guy,  he provided the voice of the character Mayor Adam West. He played himself for years on the animated  The Fairly OddParents  and appeared on the venerable animated series  The Simpsons.  West also voiced the Caped Crusader and other characters in numerous animated incarnations of Batman. FILE PHOTO - Actor Adam West poses for photographers at a ceremony where he received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in Los Angeles April 5, 2012.Phil McCarten'Curious Stirrings'   We had some very good writers for the original show,  West said in a 2010 interview with the Slice of SciFi website.  They saw the craziness, the comedy. You know, just as he's about to put her in (jail), Batman says to Catwoman, 'You give me curious stirrings in my utility belt.' That's funny stuff.   In protecting Gotham City from super criminals, Batman and Robin invariably would find their lives threatened in some fiendish trap, only to escape using their endless ingenuity. For example, Robin was once nearly swallowed alive by a giant clam in an episode with the Joker. Batman and Robin were nearly turned into frozen desserts - Frosty Freezies - in an episode with famed film director Otto Preminger as Mr. Freeze. Slideshow (4 Images)Like some other actors who became inseparable in the minds of fans from a character they played - Leonard Nimoy as Mr. Spock on  Star Trek  is another example - West long resented his association with Batman but learned to like it.  I think it was a very simple deduction. I think any intelligent person would come to the same conclusion,  he said in 2010.  And that is: if I am being turned down for other roles because of my association with Batman, then maybe what I should do is really embrace Batman. Pursue it and keep it alive, which is what I've been trying to do for 30 years.  Bob Kane, who created Batman in 1939, seemed to agree. West kept a drawing of Batman by Kane, who inscribed it:  To my buddy, Adam, who breathed life into my pen and ink creation.  While struggling to land post-Batman acting roles, West turned to making personal appearances wearing the Batman cape and cowl - some rather undignified, as when he appeared on a Memphis pro wrestling program opposite wrestler Jerry  The King  Lawler. West was born as William  Billy  Anderson in Washington state in 1928. He took the name Adam West when he came to Hollywood in 1959. Pre- Batman,  he co-starred in the 1965 Three Stooges feature film  The Outlaws Is Coming  and the 1964 sci-fi film  Robinson Crusoe on Mars.  But it was his performance in a TV commercial that caught the notice of the  Batman  producers.  They'd seen a series of commercials I'd done for Nestle Quick instant milkshake in which I did a kind of spoof on the James Bond character,  West told Bizarre magazine in 2004.  They saw the commercials and thought, 'Hey, maybe this is the guy that can play the character in the way that we envision it.'

Cheering spectators packed sidewalks as floats with rainbow balloons and papier mache rainbows snaked 1.5 miles (2.4 km) through residential neighborhoods several blocks north of the White House. In almost 90 Fahrenheit (32 Celsius) heat, some men went shirtless or donned feather boas. Protesters who oppose the Capital Pride parade's corporate backing, which includes bank Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) and weapons maker Northrop Grumman Corp (NOC.N), briefly blocked the parade route and forced it to be rerouted. The protest group, No Justice No Pride, said in a statement that Capital Pride also needed to add a transgender minority woman to its board and bar police from marching in the parade. The Capital Pride parade was among a bevy of gay pride events this weekend scheduled for cities across the United States, including Boston, Detroit, Milwaukee, and Kalamazoo, Michigan. “We need to be out here to tell people that God loves them for who they are and who they love,” said the Rev. Alex Dyer, 38, an Episcopal priest from Washington who marched in the parade with his husband and 2-year-old daughter. Thousands celebrate the annual LGBTQ Capital Pride parade in Washington, June 10, 2017.James Lawler DugganThe parade in the heavily Democratic U.S. capital featured T-shirts that said  Love Trumps Hate,  an apparent reference to   President Donald Trump. The Republican has voiced support for gay rights but his administration has revoked federal guidelines that let transgender students use bathrooms of their choice. Damian Jessup, 30, who traveled from Norfolk, Virginia, to march with gay Republicans, defended Trump and his support for gays.

In San Francisco, the SF Weekly newspaper reported the parade in that city would include a  resistance contingent  and an immigrant rights speaker.

The Briton's third pole in a row in Canada equalled Michael Schumacher's record of six at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve, but it took a stunning lap worthy of his late Brazilian hero Senna to do it. After Ferrari had dominated the day's final practice, Hamilton moved it up a level with a lap faster than any previously recorded at the sun-bathed island circuit. Then, with Ferrari's championship leader Sebastian Vettel piling on the pressure with a time only 0.004 slower, the Briton went even faster to finish with a flourish and a lap of one minute 11.459 seconds.  It was a sexy lap. It was a great lap. I can't believe that it came together so well,  he said.  At the time while doing the lap I had no comprehension that I was going for my 65th. I had completely forgotten that. It was just about the here-and-now.  The pole, which left him three adrift of Schumacher's all-time record of 68, came 10 years on from the first of his Formula One career at the same track with McLaren in his rookie 2007 season. Vettel, a four times world champion with Red Bull who leads Hamilton by 25 points after six races, qualified second for Sunday's race. Related CoverageStroll to make Canada debut 10 places behind MassaFinland's Valtteri Bottas, who replaced retired 2016 champion Nico Rosberg at Mercedes in January, qualified third  with Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen, the polesitter in Monaco two weeks ago, fourth. Red Bull will make up the third row with young Dutchman Max Verstappen qualifying fifth alongside Australian team mate Daniel Ricciardo. Senna Helmet After qualifying, Hamilton was presented with one of Senna's race-worn helmets -- a gesture from the Brazilian driver's family that left him moved and momentarily stunned.  I'm shaken, I'm speechless,  he said, standing in front of the crowded stands with the gift.  Ayrton, I know for many of you was your favorite driver and it was the same for me. He was the one who inspired me to be where I am today. So to match him, and to receive this, is the greatest honor.  Senna, also a triple champion, died in a crash at Italy's Imola circuit in 1994.  It was a scintillating duel between Hamilton and Vettel, adding another line in what is shaping up as a season long fight.  He (Hamilton) was the better man today but I am not entirely happy,  said the German, winner of three of six races so far, compared to Hamilton's two.  Nevertheless I feel the car is very good, I was really happy this morning, I was happy this afternoon and it should be very good in the race so I'm looking forward to tomorrow.  While Mercedes celebrated a return to form, the struggles continued down the paddock at McLaren as double world champion Fernando Alonso, back from his Indianapolis 500 adventure, failed to get out of the second qualifying and will start 12th. The Spaniard's Belgian team mate Stoffel Vandoorne had an even more frustrating day and will start 16th in the 20 car field. Pressure has been mounting on McLaren's engine partner Honda to deliver but no upgrades have been ready for Montreal and the team continues to languish down the timesheets. Canadian teenager Lance Stroll disappointed the large flag-waving home crowd when he failed to make it out of the opening round of qualifying. The first Canadian to race at home in Formula One since 1997 champion Jacques Villeneuve in 2006, Stroll and his Williams team are hoping the 18-year-old can snatch his first points of the season. But he will be starting 17th and will need to produce something extra special to crack the top 10. Williams, however, have produced good performances on the island layout with a driver on the podium for the last two years.

Massa was enticed back by Williams to replace Valtteri Bottas, who was signed by Mercedes to replace retired 2016 champion Nico Rosberg, and help steer Stroll through his Formula One initiation. While Stroll looked lost during Saturday qualifying, Massa oozed the confidence of a veteran making the most of his experience.  I think I am doing a good job,  said Massa.  I'm really happy with how things are going, the performance, working with the team, understanding the car, setups, the balance, it fits the way I like to drive as well.  Part of Massa's job is to tutor Stroll and at times step in and defend him as he did on Saturday.  It’s the first time he’s driving here, it is a tricky track,  offered Massa.  I am trying to help him in everything. I’m sure every day he’s getting better.  Definitely he needs to understand new things, it’s not easy. Maybe Formula One is not so easy as people think.  Coming from a country where motor racing ranks only second to soccer in terms of sporting passion Massa understands the pressure on a driver when he competes at his home grand prix. In 2006 and 2008, Massa lived up to those expectations when he won his home race in Sao Paulo. For Stroll that breakthrough is unlikely to come on Sunday. The son of one of Canada's richest men, he has yet to register a point in his debut season and each scoreless race brings more talk that he only secured his place because of a wealthy father. Stroll has tried to avoid excuses but, after another disappointing qualifying effort, was searching for a reason.  I've never actually been here before and in qualifying one I was 7/10ths off,  offered Stroll.  OK, it sounds like a lot but it is a little bit in every corner and I have never been here.  It's just tricky, the track is not so easy and today we just missed it a little bit.  Editing by Alan Baldwin","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-motor-f1-canada-williams-idUSKBN19200N"},

After an additional scan, the muscle tear that I sustained in Rome will unfortunately not allow me to compete in the grass court tournaments I was scheduled to play,  Sharapova, who is on a comeback trail after serving a 15-month doping ban, said on her official Facebook page.   Sharapova opted not to apply for a wildcard into the main  Wimbledon draw after her request for an invite into Roland Garros, where she is a twice former champion, was snubbed by French Open officials.  The Russian's low ranking meant she was only guaranteed a place in the Wimbledon qualifying event if she wanted to secure a place in the July 3-16 grasscourt major.  However, the 2004 Wimbledon champion was granted a wildcard for the grasscourt warm-up tournament in Birmingham, England, which she will also miss.   I want to thank the LTA for their amazing support on my return and providing me with a Birmingham wildcard, a tournament which I hope many of you will be able to attend,  added the 178th-ranked Sharapova.   I look forward to meeting you there next year. I will continue to work on my recovery and my next scheduled tournament is in Stanford.  The Stanford tournament begins at the end of July. The five-times grand slam winner, who received wildcards to play in Stuttgart, Madrid and Rome after being left without a ranking when her doping ban ended, retired injured in her second round match at the Italian Open. She was wearing a bandage on her thigh at the time. Missing the whole grasscourt season means the 30-year-old Russian will not be ranked high enough for direct entry into the U.S. Open, where officials will have to decide whether to court controversy by offering a wildcard.

Britain is due to begin negotiations with the rest of the European Union about the terms of its departure in nine days time, despite Prime Minister Theresa May being weakened by losing her majority in Thursday's election. Fabrice Bregier, chief operating officer of Airbus, said a deal must allow its staff from all over the world to enter Britain easily, ensure that parts are exempt from trade tariffs and ensure certain regulatory standards are maintained.  Otherwise, he said, Britain would risk losing Airbus production in the future.  For new productions, it's very easy to have a new plant somewhere in the world. We would have plenty of offers to do that,  Bregier said, according to the newspaper.  We want to stay in the UK — provided the conditions to work in an integrated organization are met.  May might be forced to reassess her Brexit priorities after being weakened by the election. She has previously said she wants Britain to withdraw from Europe's custom union as well as its single market. She has also said no deal would be better than a bad deal, implying she could accept tariffs on imports and exports. Airbus Chief Executive Tom Enders said on Thursday that a  hard Brexit  where trade tariffs between the UK and European Union were imposed could potentially impact the competitiveness of the firm's activities in Britain.

Outteridge, who is an Olympic gold medallist in the physically demanding 49er skiff, slipped and shot off the back of his  flying  high-tech catamaran as it went through a high-speed manoeuvre on Bermuda's Great Sound. The two crews, who are going head-to-head in their quest to take on America's Cup holders Oracle Team USA, fought three fascinating duels in their catamarans. New Zealand showed the same slick consistency they have done throughout the challenger series, keeping their 50-foot (15 metre) foiling catamaran above the water for much of the time. But after making a crucial error in the first race and allowing New Zealand to get past them, Artemis Racing sailed a near perfect race in their second encounter to level the series. Artemis Racing managed to stay on their foils for the whole of the second race, while New Zealand kept their hulls flying out of the water for 99.9 percent of the time.  Outteridge had outsmarted his long-standing rival Peter Burling at the start and the crew of six elite sailors managed to fend off New Zealand's repeated attempts to pass them. But in the last race, when they also made the better start, the loss of Outteridge overboard threw the crew and they were unable to get back up to speed and conceded defeat. Burling said such mishaps were  part of it , adding:  I felt like even if he (Outteridge) didn't fall off we would have got that gate (course marker) off him . Outteridge was left stranded in the water, from where he was later picked up by a support boat. The next races are due to take place on Sunday.

Then perhaps even more surprisingly, he demonstrated an ability to take advantage of the knowledge. The diminutive Dozier watched as the wind blew his high fly ball over the left-field fence in the fifth inning, a two-run homer that broke a tie and sent the Twins to a 3-2 victory over the San Francisco Giants in the second game of their interleague series. Right-handers Tyler Duffey, Matt Belisle and Brandon Kintzler protected a one-run lead with 3 2/3 innings of hitless relief as the American League Central-leading Twins improved to 6-3 on their 10-game Western swing that ends Sunday.  I like the question,  Dozier responded when asked to explain why the Twins, who became baseball's fourth 20-game winner on the road this season, were playing so well away from home.  The question is usually: Why can't you win at home?  We've got to start winning at home. But if we keep winning on the road, I'll take it.  Brandon Belt homered for the Giants, who lost for the seventh time in their last nine home games.  We really played a good game,  Giants manager Bruce Bochy said.  We have a hard time here at home. Wish I could put my finger on it. Right now, it's a challenge for us.  Related CoveragePreview: Twins at GiantsMinnesota Twins - PlayerWatchSan Francisco Giants - PlayerWatchKennys Vargas belted the second-longest home run of the 2017 season, a 471-footer off Giants right-hander Jeff Samardzija, to offset Belt's first-inning homer and draw the Twins even at 1-1 in the fourth. Chris Gimenez then led off the fifth with a single and, with two outs, Dozier lifted a high fly that, given the way Giants left fielder Austin Slater seemed to be tracking it, appeared destined to die on the warning track. But the ball carried into the second row of the bleachers for Dozier's 10th homer of the season, giving the Twins a lead they never relinquished.  Look at the flags,  Dozier observed.  The flags at the top, they blow out. The lower flags blow in. It swirls.  You've got to get it high. The ball flies here during the day.  The homer was Dozier's third in his last 19 interleague games, a stretch during which he has hit .310 (26-for-84) and driven in 16 runs.  I like interleague play,  he said.  There's a lot more switching.  Once his team got the lead, Twins manager Paul Molitor switched pitchers three times, with all three moves working to perfection. Buster Posey's infield out plated Eduardo Nunez in the fifth to draw the Giants within 3-2, but San Francisco had only one hit the rest of the way against Twins starter Jose Berrios and three relievers. Duffey came on after Austin Slater's second of two hits, a single, put the potential tying run aboard with one out in the sixth. Duffey got pinch-hitter Kelby Tomlinson to ground into a double play to end the sixth, then retired the Giants in order in the seventh. Belisle needed just nine pitches to set down the middle of San Francisco's lineup in the eighth before Kintzler worked a 1-2-3 ninth for his 17th save.  I have to credit my teammates today,  Berrios said.  I didn't pitch that well.  Berrios (5-1) improved his road record to 4-0, allowing two runs and six hits in 5 1/3 innings. He walked three and struck out eight, giving him 39 strikeouts in 38 innings this season. In winning their third in a row, the Twins managed just five hits off Samardzija and two Giants relievers. Samardzija (2-8) allowed all three Twins runs and four hits in six innings. He struck out six and walked one, just his second walk since May 1.  He's throwing the ball great,  Bochy said of Samardzija.  Occasionally, you're going to give up three runs, maybe four, but you have to pick these pitchers up sometimes. I know this is more of a pitchers' park, but still that shouldn't happen.  Slater and Belt had two hits apiece for the Giants, who outhit the Twins 6-5. NOTES: The Twins improved 193-174 all time in interleague play, the ninth-most wins in the majors since the concept was introduced in 1997. ... The Giants have lost 12 of their last 16 interleague games. ... Giants 1B Brandon Belt's home run was a  Splash Hit  into the San Francisco Bay beyond the right field wall, the 73rd for a Giant since AT&T; Park opened in 2000.

Foreign leaders expressed growing concern over the dispute, which pits Qatar against Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Bahrain and Egypt. With backing from U.S. President Donald Trump, they accuse Qatar of supporting their regional arch-rival Iran as well as Islamist militants. Kuwait has led a regional effort to mediate, but the four states intensified the pressure on Friday by placing dozens of people with alleged links to Qatar on terrorism blacklists.

[nL8N1J70F5] Mixed Messages However, mixed messages from U.S. officials appeared to complicate the diplomacy, as Gulf media cited selectively from divergent statements to bolster their positions.  Saudi Arabia and Bahrain issued statements welcoming U.S. President Donald Trump's demand the previous day for Qatar to stop supporting terrorism, while ignoring a U.S. State Department call for them to ease pressure. Saudi Arabia said it was committed to  decisive and swift action to cut off all funding sources for terrorism  in a statement carried by the state news agency SPA, while Bahrain hailed U.S. efforts to ensure  international solidarity  on the issue. The United Arab Emirates praised Trump's  leadership in challenging Qatar's troubling support for extremism  in a separate statement released on Friday. [nL1N1J61RY] Trump had accused Qatar of being a  high level  funder of terrorism on Friday, even as the Pentagon and U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson cautioned against the military, commercial and humanitarian effects of a blockade imposed by Arab states and others. [nL8N1J61K3] A separate SPA report on Saturday acknowledged Tillerson's call for Qatar to curtail support for terrorism, without mentioning that he had also said the crisis was hurting ordinary Qataris, impairing business and harming the U.S. fight against the Islamic State militant group. Saudi Arabia said its action followed the conclusions of last month's Arab Islamic American Summit in Riyadh, where Trump delivered a speech about Islamist extremism. Trump said he had helped to plan the move against Qatar, although a senior administration official told Reuters this week that Washington had had no indication from the Saudis or Emiratis during the visit that they would sever ties with Qatar.

The Philippines military said the United States was providing technical assistance to end the siege of Marawi City by fighters allied to Islamic State, which is now in its third week, but it had no boots on the ground.  They are not fighting. They are just providing technical support,  military spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Jo-Ar Herrera told a news conference in Marawi City. The Pentagon, which has no permanent presence in the Philippines but for years has kept 50 to 100 special forces troops in the south of the country on rotational exercises, confirmed it was helping the Philippine military in Marawi.  It said in a statement it was providing Philippine forces with security assistance and training in the areas of intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance. It said it had an additional 300 to 500 troops in the country to support regular training and activities, without giving further details.  Speaking on condition of anonymity, a U.S. official said support included aerial surveillance and targeting, electronic eavesdropping, communications assistance and training. A U.S. P-3 Orion surveillance plane was seen flying over the town on Friday, according to media reports.  There is no direct U.S. participation in combat, which is prohibited by Philippine law, although our forces involved in training the Philippine military are authorized to defend themselves,  the U.S. official said.  The cooperation between the longtime allies is significant because Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, who came to power a year ago, has taken a hostile stance towards Washington and has vowed to eject U.S. military trainers and advisers from his country. The seizure of Marawi City on May 23 has alarmed Southeast Asian nations which fear that Islamic State - facing setbacks in Syria and Iraq - is establishing a stronghold on the Philippine island of Mindanao that could threaten the whole region. About 40 foreigners have fought alongside the Philippine militants in Marawi City, most of them from Indonesia and Malaysia, though some came from the Middle East. The Philippines military suffered its biggest one-day loss on Friday since 10 troops were killed in a friendly-fire incident on June 1. Herrera said 13 marines conducting clearing operations died after an  intense  house-to-house firefight during which they encountered improvised explosive devices and were attacked by rocket-propelled grenades.

Reports of Maute Brothers Killed At least 200 militants are holed up in a corner of the town. An estimated 500 to 1,000 civilians are trapped there, some being held as human shields, while others are hiding in their homes with no access to running water, electricity or food. Slideshow (5 Images)The military said it was making headway in the town but was proceeding carefully so as not to destroy mosques where some of the militants had taken up positions.   We give premium to the mosques, because this is very symbolic to our Muslim brothers,  Herrera said. The Philippines is majority Christian, but Mindanao has a significant population of Muslims and Marawi City is overwhelmingly Muslim. One of the main Islamist factions dug in around the heart of the city is the Maute group, a relative newcomer amid the throng of insurgents, separatists and bandits on Mindanao. Herrera said the military was  validating  reports that the two Maute brothers who founded the group had been killed.  We are still awaiting confirmation,  he said.  We are still validating those reports but there are strong indications.  Maute joined forces with Isnilon Hapilon, who was last year proclaimed by Islamic State as its Southeast Asia  emir .     Military officials believe Hapilon is still in the town. The military has said it is aiming to end the siege by Monday, the Philippines' independence day.

Britain is due to begin negotiations with the rest of the European Union about the terms of its departure in nine days time, despite Prime Minister Theresa May being weakened by losing her majority in Thursday's election. Fabrice Bregier, chief operating officer of Airbus, said a deal must allow its staff from all over the world to enter Britain easily, ensure that parts are exempt from trade tariffs and ensure certain regulatory standards are maintained.  Otherwise, he said, Britain would risk losing Airbus production in the future.  For new productions, it's very easy to have a new plant somewhere in the world. We would have plenty of offers to do that,  Bregier said, according to the newspaper.  We want to stay in the UK — provided the conditions to work in an integrated organization are met.  May might be forced to reassess her Brexit priorities after being weakened by the election. She has previously said she wants Britain to withdraw from Europe's custom union as well as its single market. She has also said no deal would be better than a bad deal, implying she could accept tariffs on imports and exports. Airbus Chief Executive Tom Enders said on Thursday that a  hard Brexit  where trade tariffs between the UK and European Union were imposed could potentially impact the competitiveness of the firm's activities in Britain. Airbus employs over 10,000 people across two plants in Britain, according to the company's website.

A backup catcher, Chirinos came through with his second late-inning homer in four days on Saturday afternoon. Chirinos hit a three-run homer with two outs in the top of the 11th inning on a 2-2 pitch from Shawn Kelley as the Texas Rangers beat the Washington Nationals 6-3. The veteran, who backs up All-Star Jonathan Lucroy, hit a game-tying homer in the eighth inning Wednesday against the New York Mets two days after he turned 33.  It was an amazing win for us. It was really good,  Chirinos said.  I stayed short and put the ball in play. Thank God it went out of the ballpark. I was trying to put a good swing on it.  Chirinos now has seven homers in just 76 at-bats and that production is not lost on teammate Delino DeShields, a center fielder from Maryland who had two hits for the second day in a row.  Robby is probably one of the most prepared guys I have ever been around. He continues to believe in himself,  DeShields said. The loss exposed more bullpen problems for the first-place Nationals, who learned after the game that closer Koda Glover has been experiencing some back issues. Glover gave up three hits and two runs in the ninth as the Rangers tied the game and forced extra innings. Related CoveragePreview: Rangers at NationalsTexas Rangers - PlayerWatchWashington Nationals - PlayerWatch He said his back was really locked up, we didn't know it,  Washington manager Dusty Baker said.  He's frustrated and we're frustrated because we can't keep him healthy and 100 percent right now and we don't know why.  In addition, Nationals first baseman Ryan Zimmerman, leading the league with a .365 batting average, did not play for the second time in three days. Baker said his back locked up after he dove for a ball in Los Angeles during a recent road trip.  It's one of those things where if you continue to play and it gets worse, something bad could happen. If you give it a day or two you can kind of just stop it right there,  Zimmerman said.  Even if I don't play tomorrow, I can't see me not playing on Monday.  The losing pitcher was Kelley (3-2) while Keone Kela (3-1) got the win as he went two scoreless innings. The Nationals (38-23) are 17-11 at home while Texas (29-32) is 11-18 on the road. Washington had a chance to win in the last of the ninth after pinch-hitter Stephen Drew led off with a double. Pinch-runner Wilmer Difo went to third on a groundout but was tagged out in a rundown for the third out after speedy Trea Turner tried to bunt for a base hit with two outs.  That's a tough read, but if you're going to go you've got to go, especially against a left-hander,  Baker said of Difo. Shin-Soo Choo led off the Texas ninth with a homer to trim the deficit to 3-2 off Glover. Elvis Andrus singled, Adrian Beltre walked and Nomar Mazara had a double to score Andrus and tie the game at 3.  We battled the whole game,  Mazara said.  We never put our heads down.  Chirinos then flew out to right fielder Bryce Harper and his throw to home appeared late to catch a sliding pinch-runner Pete Kozma. But the Nationals challenged the call and Kozma was ruled out as the game remained tied at 3. Washington lefty Oliver Perez took over for Glover and retired Rougned Odor for the final out of the ninth. Adam Lind (two hits) had a two-run homer in the sixth to give the Nationals a 3-1 lead. Washington trailed 1-0 before Anthony Rendon had a sacrifice fly to score Harper, who led off with a double and went to third on a single by Daniel Murphy in the sixth. It was the fifth homer in 73 at-bats for Lind, who got the start at first base in place of Zimmerman. Washington starter Gio Gonzalez allowed just one run and three hits and struck out nine in six innings for the Nationals. The Rangers took a 1-0 lead in the fourth as Andrus drove in a run on a groundout. Andrus extended his league-best hitting streak to 14 games with a single in the first. Martin Perez gave up seven hits and two runs in five-plus innings for Texas. Andrus also had two hits for Texas. Murphy, Michael A. Taylor and Ryan Raburn each had two hits for the Nationals.  This is the beginning of a tough road trip. This is a real test to see what we are about,  DeShields said. NOTES: Texas 3B Adrian Beltre (1-for-3 with a walk) was in the starting lineup for the Rangers after missing the previous two games. He landed awkwardly on first base while running out a ground ball Tuesday. ... Rangers 3B coach Tony Beasley grew up in central Virginia, played in college at Liberty University and is a former coach for the Nationals. ... Washington pitching coach Mike Maddux held the same job for the Rangers from 2009 to 2015. ... The Nationals will pick No. 25 and Texas No. 26 in the first round of the Major League First-Year Player Draft on Monday. Darren Baker, son of Nationals manager Dusty Baker, is eligible as a standout prep senior from California. The younger Baker has committed to play college ball at California.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-rangers-nationals-writethru-idUSMTZED6ACN49UE"},

The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a group of Kurdish and Arab militias supported by a U.S.-led coalition, began to attack Raqqa on Tuesday after a months-long campaign to cut it off. The U.S.-led coalition estimates that Raqqa, which Islamic State seized from Syrian rebels in 2014 during their lightning advance in Syria and Iraq, is defended by 3,000 to 4,000 jihadists. It has been a hub both for Islamic State's military leaders and its bureaucrats, and has been used to plot attacks in countries around the world. The SDF said it had seized al-Mishlab district in the far east of Raqqa on Friday and al-Sabahia district in the west. The war monitor, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said the SDF had taken Mishlab and more than half of Sabahia. The forces are now advancing into al-Romania district in northwest Raqqa, the SDF and the Observatory said. Islamic State had turned back an earlier SDF assault on a military base on the north side, the Observatory said. Islamic State still has a long sweep of territory along Syria's Euphrates valley and wide stretches of desert, despite recent losses to the SDF, the Syrian army and rebel groups. A Syrian Democratic Forces fighter uses a tablet as he sits inside a room in the al-Mishlab district at Raqqa's southeastern outskirts.Rodi SaidFormer residents in touch with relatives in the beleaguered city said at least 50 people, mostly civilians, were killed in escalating U.S.-led strikes in the last 24 hours on residential areas inside the city.  More than 10 people were killed and dozens injured on Saturday when jets believed to belong to the U.S.-led coalition hit the city's main Nour Street in the centre of the commercial area, they said.  The other strike that killed at least 14 people was in the western neighbourhood of Jazra, where jets targeted an internet cafe, according to Muhab Nasser, an exile from Raqqa in touch with relatives and friends.  Slideshow (2 Images)Amaq, a news agency affiliated to Islamic State, released images of what is said were white phosphorus munitions lighting the city of Raqqa that were dropped by the U.S.-led coalition. The agency said 33 people were killed and 25 injured in a series of raids overnight. Videos posted by Raqqa activists and personal accounts coming out of the city also cited witnesses saying the city was hit for the second consecutive night with incendiary bombs. The U.S.-led coalition does not deny using incendiary bombs and says casualties are unavoidable even as it tries to minimise the impact of its military campaign on civilians.   To the west of Raqqa, the Syrian army and its allies have advanced into Islamic State territory and on Friday reached SDF lines near the town of Tabqa, 40km (25 miles) from the city.  The Syrian government has described the SDF's war against Islamic State as  legitimate  and said its military priorities are further east, suggesting it does not plan to confront the group now.

ACT for America, a self-described grassroots organization focusing on national security, staged rallies in New York, Chicago, Boston, Denver and Seattle, as well as many smaller cities. Hundreds of people pledged on social media to attend an event that ACT billed as  March against Sharia.  On the steps of the Pennsylvania state capitol in  Harrisburg, barricades and a heavy police presence, including officers mounted on horses, separated about 60 anti-sharia demonstrators from an equal number of counter-protesters. Many of the latter were dressed in black masks and hoods and chanting  No Trump, no KKK, no Fascist USA.   The atmosphere was tense but the protest went off with no violence and only one arrest, police said.  More than a dozen men belonging to the anti-government Oath Keepers were on hand, invited by ACT to provide security. Most of them carried handguns. Chris Achey, 47, of Allentown, Pennsylvania, said he did not hate Muslims but believes that much of Islam is incompatible with Western culture.  The Constitution is the law of the land,  he said.  We have to be careful with who we let in the country.  On its website, ACT described sharia, which covers many aspects of Muslim life including religious obligations and financial dealings, as incompatible with human rights. It said sharia justifies the oppression of women and homosexuality, and advocates female genital mutilation. But critics say the organization vilifies Muslims and has repeatedly equated Islam with extremism. In their view, the rallies are part of a wave of anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant sentiment fueled by President Donald Trump, who called for a ban on Muslims entering the country during his election campaign. Molly Freiburg, 33, of Philadelphia, was one of the counter-protesters but not part of the larger group clad in black. Anti-sharia protesters scuffle with counter demonstrators and members of the Minnesota State Patrol at the state capitol in St. Paul, Minnesota, U.S. June 10, 2017.Adam Bettcher America is not in danger from sharia law,  she said.  This manifestation at the Capitol is actually a way to make our Muslim neighbors feel uncomfortable.  A representative for ACT for America could not be reached for comment. In Seattle, about 75 anti-sharia protesters were outnumbered by counter-protesters at a rally that was moved from Portland, Oregon. Tensions are running high in Portland after a man yelling religious and racial slurs at two teenage girls on a commuter train fatally stabbed two men who tried to stop him.     Talbot Sleater, a 62-year-old construction foreman, said that the Seattle protest was the first of the kind that he had attended. A Briton who moved to the United States, he said he had decided to go after recent attacks in his home country.

The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), the country's largest Muslim advocacy group, urged Americans to participate in one of several local educational events being organized in  a peaceful challenge to Saturday's hate rallies.   It also warned Muslims to take extra precautions against potential violence over the weekend. Anti-Muslim incidents rose 57 percent last year, including a 44 percent jump in anti-Islamic hate crimes, CAIR said in a report released in early May. Oath Keepers said on its website that it was  answering the call to defend free speech against those who would use terrorist violence or the threat of violence to shut it down.

In only her 18th match in one of the four majors, the 20-year-old Latvian fought back from a set and 3-0 down to blaze past the experienced Romanian 4-6 6-4 6-3 and become her country's first grand slam champion. Not only that but she is the first unseeded woman to win the Suzanne Lenglen trophy since 1933 and she emulated the great Brazilian Gustavo Kuerten by claiming her first title of any kind on the hallowed Parisian claycourts. Kuerten's 1997 victory came on the day Ostapenko was born. Ostapenko had promised to stick to her uncomplicated routine of attack-attack-attack before the final and was true to her word as she walloped 54 clean winners -- and 54 unforced errors. It was claycourt tennis, but not as we know it. Third seed Halep buckled under the strain of fending off the missiles being launched off Ostapenko's lime green racket. Yet for much of the contest, hanging into rallies by her fingernails, it seemed Halep's steady approach would see her become only the second Romanian woman to win a grand slam title after her manager Virginia Ruzici's 1978 Roland Garros win. It was not to be though. To make it a doubly difficult day for the 25-year-old, the defeat meant she also missed out on becoming world number one.

She only has one game, either I can't touch it or it flies one meter out.  Ostapenko, who had the Parisian crowd roaring her on, reeled off the last five games to claim the title and become the youngest first-time female grand slam champion since Russian Svetlana Kuznetsova won the 2004 U.S. Open. Fittingly she thumped a backhand winner past Halep to seal victory, before tossing her distinctive green headband into the crowd with a look of disbelief. There was disbelief too, amongst those who had predicted Ostapenko would not be able to reproduce the kind of tennis that has lit up Roland Garros over the past fortnight. Tennis - French Open - Roland Garros, Paris, France - June 10, 2017   Romania’s Simona Halep lifts the runners up trophy after losing the final against Latvia’s Jelena Ostapenko    Reuters / Benoit TessierSeven-times French Open champion Chris Evert was happy to stand corrected.  We didn't have the big names here this year but ... I have to say a star is born,  Evert, working as pundit for broadcaster Eurosport said. Ostapenko, who turned 20 on Thursday when she beat Swiss Timea Bacsinszky, will rocket to 12th in the rankings.  I mean I can't believe I'm champion at 20,  Ostapenko, the first woman to win the title from a set down since Jennifer Capriati in 2001, said on court. Slideshow (10 Images) I knew that Gustavo Kuerten won his first Roland Garros the day I was born, I have no words.  There were a couple of games when everything went my way and I was ready to fight for every point.  In baking sunshine Ostapenko began the match by breaking Halep's serve with three clean winners and ended it, two hours later with two scintillating backhands. What came in between was rollercoaster ride. Halep, with cheers of 'Simona' ringing out from her fans slowly roasting in the upper tiers of Philippe Chatrier Court, settled into a rhythm and broke three times to take the opener as Ostapenko's error count soared to 23. Ostapenko seemed to be unraveling in the second set as a series of shots either stung the net or flew long, allowing Halep to move 3-0 ahead. The Romanian then had break points to make it 4-0 but Ostapenko held firm to massive cheers. Back on the attack Ostapenko surged 4-3 ahead only for more errors to allow Halep to break back for 4-4. Halep was suffering though and Ostapenko broke to love before leveling the match with a sublime forehand winner. Even when Halep went 3-1 ahead in the decider, she never seemed in control and once Ostapenko's charge began she was powerless to hold off the new pride of Riga.

In general this type of boat carries 100 to 110 people, so we do not know what has happened to the others,  said Issa al-Zaroog, a coastguard spokesman in the town of Garabulli. It was not clear how the migrants, whose bodies were spotted by fishermen, had died, coastguard officials said. Earlier, Tripoli coastguard spokesman Ayoub Qassem said one Bangladeshi migrant had been killed and two wounded in crossfire when coastguards from Zawiya, just west of Tripoli, had clashed on Friday with smugglers escorting migrant boats out to sea. Qassem said two rubber boats and a wooden vessel carrying some 570 migrants had been intercepted near Sabratha, west of Tripoli, triggering the clashes, and that coastguards had destroyed a boat and a jet-ski used by smugglers, arresting three of them. But afterwards a further five rubber migrant boats got away after smugglers had fired at the coastguard from the shore and from boats, Qassem said. The International Organization for Migration (IOM) said separately that 380 migrants in three rubber boats had been intercepted off Zawiya and brought back to Libya on Friday, and that another 438 were intercepted on Saturday.    Libya is the most common departure point for migrants trying to reach Europe by sea, with the number making the crossing rising sharply since 2014. So far this year more than 61,000 migrants have arrived in Italy after crossing the central Mediterranean, according to the IOM. Most are packed onto ill-equipped vessels by Libyan smugglers, and are rescued by European ships once they reach international waters.

Trump's election pledge to build a massive wall on the U.S. border with Mexico to keep out illegal immigrants and drug traffickers has sparked anger throughout Mexico, plunging U.S.-Mexican relations to their lowest point in years. Speaking in Mexico City, Merkel, who grew up in Communist East Germany behind the Iron Curtain, said that history showed that only when empires have got on well with their neighbors have migration pressures been resolved successfully.  Obviously the main reason for people leaving must be addressed on site first, which means putting up walls and cutting oneself off will not solve the problem,  said Merkel, who has come under political pressure at home for opening German borders to more than one million refugees since 2015.  It's an issue you can study well in the history of China with the (Great) Wall of China, you can study it in the history of the Roman Empire. Essentially, only when great empires have managed to forge sensible relationships with their neighbors and to manage migration has it been a success,  she added.  I don't think that by simply improving the border facilities you can solve the problem,  she told a panel discussion alongside Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto. The key was to improve living standards and opportunities in afflicted areas, said Merkel, who did not mention Trump. Trump has backed away from a promise to make Mexico pay for the wall and has had to pare back his ambitions in seeking funds to build the barrier from the U.S. Congress, where Democrats and even some Republicans have criticized the plan. In another counterpoint to Trump, Merkel and Pena Nieto together affirmed their commitment to free trade during the German leader's visit to Latin America's No. 2 economy. Pena Nieto said Mexico will ensure that foreign investment in Mexico remains protected in talks sought by Trump to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Trump has attacked Germany and Mexico for their trade surpluses with the United States and has vowed to withdraw from NAFTA if he cannot renegotiate it in favor of the United States. Germany has made major investments in both Mexico and the United States, and Merkel said it was important not to forget the benefits that international trade had brought.  Through (international supply chains), wealth for a lot more people has been generated, and these value chains should not be destroyed again unnecessarily,  Merkel said.

Foreign leaders expressed growing concern over the dispute, which pits Qatar against Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Bahrain and Egypt. With backing from U.S. President Donald Trump, they accuse Qatar of supporting their regional arch-rival Iran as well as Islamist militants. Kuwait has led a regional effort to mediate, but the four states intensified the pressure on Friday by placing dozens of people with alleged links to Qatar on terrorism blacklists.

Saudi Arabia and Bahrain issued statements welcoming U.S. President Donald Trump's demand the previous day for Qatar to stop supporting terrorism, while ignoring a U.S. State Department call for them to ease pressure. Saudi Arabia said it was committed to  decisive and swift action to cut off all funding sources for terrorism  in a statement carried by the state news agency SPA, while Bahrain hailed U.S. efforts to ensure  international solidarity  on the issue. The United Arab Emirates praised Trump's  leadership in challenging Qatar's troubling support for extremism  in a separate statement released on Friday. [nL1N1J61RY] Trump had accused Qatar of being a  high level  funder of terrorism on Friday, even as the Pentagon and U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson cautioned against the military, commercial and humanitarian effects of a blockade imposed by Arab states and others. [nL8N1J61K3] A separate SPA report on Saturday acknowledged Tillerson's call for Qatar to curtail support for terrorism, without mentioning that he had also said the crisis was hurting ordinary Qataris, impairing business and harming the U.S. fight against the Islamic State militant group. Saudi Arabia said its action followed the conclusions of last month's Arab Islamic American Summit in Riyadh, where Trump delivered a speech about Islamist extremism. Trump said he had helped to plan the move against Qatar, although a senior administration official told Reuters this week that Washington had had no indication from the Saudis or Emiratis during the visit that they would sever ties with Qatar. On Saturday, Niger announced it had recalled its ambassador to Qatar in solidarity with Arab countries.

It would be the second consecutive week in which the White House will make a push to show Trump is moving ahead on his top domestic priority - jobs - in spite of investigations into whether he had anything to do with possible Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Trump has refuted those allegations, which have overshadowed his efforts to boost economic growth. Last week was branded  infrastructure week  with a series of events dealing with fixing the nation's decrepit roads and bridges, another plank in Trump's jobs platform. But a congressional hearing on the Russia imbroglio featuring James Comey - the FBI director Trump fired - sucked up all the attention in Washington. Next week will be  workforce development week  where the White House highlights plans to combat the skills gap. U.S. job openings surged to a record high in April with government data showing employers struggling to find workers with the right skills. Trump's plan has been in the works for months, led by his daughter Ivanka Trump, adviser Reed Cordish, and Trump's secretaries of labor, education and commerce. The White House was mum on the precise details of Trump's plan to expand apprenticeships ahead of his unveiling it in a speech at the Labor Department on Wednesday.     A real estate developer who is familiar with the use of U.S. President Donald Trump reacts to a reporter's question during a joint news conference with Romanian President Klaus Iohannis in the Rose Garden at the White House in Washington, U.S. June 9, 2017.apprenticeship programs in the building trades, Trump has praised Germany's apprenticeship system as a model.     Ivanka Trump discussed the issue with German Chancellor Angela Merkel at the White House in March, and toured a Siemens training center in Berlin in April. Trump will travel to Wisconsin on Tuesday to visit a training program at Waukesha County Technical College with Republican Governor Scott Walker, a former rival in the race to become the 2016 Republican presidential candidate. On Wednesday, Ivanka Trump will hold a roundtable on the issue with 15 CEOs at the White House. The president will then meet with eight governors on Thursday to discuss the topic at the White House. The White House declined to say which CEOs and governors would be there. One thing that likely will not be in Trump's plan: a surge in spending. The White House expects the private sector to take the lead.  A senior White House official said the federal government had allocated $16.7 billion to 43 job training programs in 13 agencies in fiscal 2017.  It's not a money question. There's a lot of money out there being thrown at this,  the official said.

InterRAO confirmed that it had started judicial proceedings.  InterRAO Group confirms that its two Dutch subsidiaries have filed two lawsuits against the Georgian government with the International Court of Arbitration,  the company's press department said. InterRAO wants to raise its electricity tariffs as well as seek compensation for losses stemming from Georgia's currency devaluation, Valishvili said. InterRAO did not specify how much it was seeking in compensation but a source close to the company told Reuters that it was $125 million as of May 1. The company bought two hydro-power plants in Georgia in 2011. The Khrami-1 and Khrami-2- plants have a capacity of 227 megawatts. InterRAO also owns a 75.11 percent stake in electricity distribution company Telasi, which serves the capital Tbilisi. It holds its assets in Georgia through its Dutch subsidiaries. Valishvili said that the government had offered to go to Georgia's state regulatory commission to find a solution over InterRAO's tariffs for electricity from its two plants.  Correction of these tariffs may be done, if the commission makes such a decision,  Valishvili said. She said that a lawsuit on Telasi was more complicated.  InterRAO did not make any investment in Telasi and even got bigger dividends than expected. Why should we pay compensation?  she said.

Court president Carmen Lúcia said in a statement on Saturday that, if proved accurate, such reports show an inadmissible meddling into the court and an attack against democratic liberties in Latin America's biggest country.  Magazine Veja reported late on Friday that the agency known as Abin might have been used to spy on Fachin - the top court justice in charge of a massive corruption probe that has ensnared Temer.  Temer's office denied the Veja report, saying the Abin  acts in accordance with the purpose for which it has been created .  If the report proves accurate, Lúcia said in the statement,  punishment of the alleged espionage should take into account the grave  legal, political and institutional consequences of such an act.

It has to be probed and repudiated, and any responsible parties properly punished.  Her remarks add to tension between the executive and judiciary branches of power, which gained intensity in the wake of Fachin's decision to validate a plea deal involving Temer in a corruption probe.

At a Finns party congress, 56 percent of those voting backed  European Parliament member Jussi Halla-aho, who wants Finland to leave the European Union. Halla-aho, who was fined by Finland's Supreme Court in 2012 for comments on a blog that linked Islam to paedophilia and Somalis to theft, has said he will push the three-party coalition to tighten immigration policies, and that he will not stay in the government at any price.  We must be more aggressive in raising the topics that distinguish us from other parties ... it is important to push our priorities forward more vigorously within the government program,  Halla-aho told reporters after his election. Prime Minister Juha Sipila, citing differences in core values, said that there was a risk the centre-right government could break up due to Halla-aho's nomination.  Of course (there is a risk of break-up). This is a tough spot for the government,  Sipila, from the Centre Party, told daily newspaper Helsingin Sanomat. The third coalition partner, the pro-EU National Coalition Party (NCP) also said it might not want to cooperate.  This requires serious contemplation. The Finns party is not the same party anymore,  Finance Minister Petteri Orpo told Verkkouutiset, an online news site. As snap elections are very rare in the Nordic country, a break-up of the coalition would likely mean that Sipila would try to form a new one. That could derail healthcare and local government reforms central to Sipila's plan to balance public finances. Sipila is due to meet Halla-aho and Orpo on Monday. FILE PHOTO - Finland's Prime Minister Juha Sipila listens to media after government's open session for members of public took place during the celebration of the 100th anniversary of Finnish independence in Porvoo, Finland May 4, 2017.Ints KalninsThe party congress also replaced all three deputy leaders with hardline anti-immigration politicians Laura Huhtasaari, Teuvo Hakkarainen and Juho Eerola. Hakkarainen earlier this year was fined for a Facebook post calling for a Muslim-free Finland, which a district court said amounted to agitation against an ethnic group.     Right-Wing Populism Slideshow (6 Images)Formerly the True Finns, the party is known for having complicated EU bailout talks during the euro zone crisis. But after becoming the second-biggest party in parliament in 2015, it joined the coalition government and accepted compromises, angering core voters. Support for the Finns party has plunged from 17.7 percent in a 2015 election to about 9 percent in a poll this month. Mari K Niemi, a researcher at University of Turku, said the party, which had sought to represent underprivileged people from rural areas, was becoming a more radical right-wing populist party.  Young, sometimes educated people with an anti-immigration focus have become a more significant power within the party,  she said, comparing the party's new profile to the far-right Sweden Democrats and France's National Front. Finland is recovering from a decade of stagnation and problems including the decline of Nokia's former phone business. The government has sought to boost growth and curb public debt growth by cutting spending and reforming labor laws.  If the coalition continues, it gets more and more difficult for the parties to agree on anything. And if the government broke up, a new coalition would surely change the current fiscal policy program,  said Nordea analyst Jan Von Gerich. Outgoing Finns party leader and co-founder Timo Soini - a moderate populist who mostly focused on criticising the EU - stepped down after 20 years. It was unclear whether he would stay on as foreign minister. Editing by Andrew Bolton","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-finland-government-finnsparty-idUSKBN19109T"},

The unseeded Ostapenko, 20, downed Romanian third seed Simona Halep 4-6 6-4 6-3 in the final, hitting a staggering 54 winners and taking her tournament tally to 299. Those numbers are counter-balanced by her unforced errors -- 54 on Saturday and 271 in total -- but they were not enough to stop the energy-charged Ostapenko from bulldozing her way to the title, firing faster forehands on average than men's world number one Andy Murray. Asked when she realized her daughter had so much power, Jelena Jakovleva said:  The day she was born.  She had the same energy when she was little, it was very difficult,  Jakovleva, who coaches her daughter, told a group of reporters at Roland Garros.  She danced, swam, played tennis, she played football because she had so much energy.  She's fearless, she fights for every point.

She was on an excursion with her father at Roland Garros and she said maybe one time I will become a champion here.

Jakovleva stayed home in Latvia during the first week of this year's French Open but even after she arrived in Paris she could not watch her daughter's matches from the stands.  I was nervous,  she said.  And Jelena has more focus if I'm not there.

Qatar will pay the Ashcroft Law Firm $2.5 million for a 90-day period as the country seeks to confirm its efforts to fight global terrorism and comply with financial regulations including U.S. Treasury rules, according to a Foreign Agents Registration Act, or FARA, filing on Friday with the Justice Department.  The firm's work will include crisis response and management, program and system analysis, media outreach, education and advocacy regarding the client's historical, current and future efforts to combat global terror and its compliance goals and accomplishments,  according to a letter by Ashcroft firm partner Michael Sullivan included in the filing. Qatar faces isolation by fellow Arab countries after Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Egypt severed ties with Doha on Monday, accusing it of supporting Islamist militants and their adversary Iran. Qatar denies the  allegations. The crisis is a major diplomatic test for the United States, which is a close ally of countries on both sides but has given mixed signals on whether to isolate Qatar or bring it into talks with other Gulf countries. [nL8N1J61K3] Trump on Friday accused Qatar of being a  high level  sponsor of terrorism in remarks made shortly after his secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, pushed Qatar's Arab neighbors to  immediately take steps to de-escalate the situation.  The Ashcroft firm was hired to do a compliance and regulatory view of Qatar's anti-money laundering and counterterrorist financing framework, Sullivan said in an email.  Qatar is confident that the review and analysis will confirm that Qatar has significant measures in place to prevent and detect efforts to launder funds and/or to use its financial systems to finance terrorist organizations,  he said.   Ashcroft was U.S. attorney general under President George W. Bush from February 2001 to February 2005, turbulent years in which U.S. policies and laws were reshaped by the so-called war on terrorism that followed the 2001 al Qaeda attacks.

Qatar will pay the Ashcroft Law Firm $2.5 million for a 90-day period as the country seeks to confirm its efforts to fight global terrorism and comply with financial regulations including U.S. Treasury rules, according to a Foreign Agents Registration Act, or FARA, filing on Friday with the Justice Department.  The firm's work will include crisis response and management, program and system analysis, media outreach, education and advocacy regarding the client's historical, current and future efforts to combat global terror and its compliance goals and accomplishments,  according to a letter by Ashcroft firm partner Michael Sullivan included in the filing. Qatar faces isolation by fellow Arab countries after Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Egypt severed ties with Doha on Monday, accusing it of supporting Islamist militants and their adversary Iran. Qatar denies the allegations. The crisis is a major diplomatic test for the United States, which is a close ally of countries on both sides but has given mixed signals on whether to isolate Qatar or bring it into talks with other Gulf countries. Trump on Friday accused Qatar of being a  high level  sponsor of terrorism in remarks made shortly after his secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, pushed Qatar's Arab neighbors to  immediately take steps to de-escalate the situation.  The Ashcroft firm was hired to do a compliance and regulatory view of Qatar's anti-money laundering and counterterrorist financing framework, Sullivan said in an email.  Qatar is confident that the review and analysis will confirm that Qatar has significant measures in place to prevent and detect efforts to launder funds and/or to use its financial systems to finance terrorist organizations,  he said. Ashcroft was U.S. attorney general under President George W. Bush from February 2001 to February 2005, turbulent years in which U.S. policies and laws were reshaped by the so-called war on terrorism that followed the 2001 al Qaeda attacks.

Comey delivered scathing remarks about the president on Thursday at a congressional hearing and testified that Trump had asked him to drop a Federal Bureau of Investigation probe into former aide Michael Flynn and his alleged ties to Russia.  Trump said Comey's testimony also vindicated him from allegations that he colluded with Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.  James Comey confirmed a lot of what I said. And some of the things that he said just weren't true,  Trump said at a news conference in the White House Rose Garden. Asked by a reporter if he had told Comey to drop the investigation into former national security adviser Flynn, Trump said,  I didn't say that.  The reporter then asked,  So he lied about that?   Well, I didn't say that. I mean, I will tell you, I didn't say that,  Trump replied.  And there would be nothing wrong if I did say it according to everybody that I've read today, but I did not say that,  he said. Related CoverageHouse panel wants Comey recordingsAbout 19.5 million U.S. viewers watched Comey testify about TrumpFactbox: Trump on Twitter (June 9) - Comey, Dodd-Frank repeal, jobsIn his testimony, Comey also said Trump asked him in January to pledge loyalty to the president, an unusual request that would put in doubt the independence of the FBI.   I hardly know the man. I'm not going to say I want you to pledge allegiance. Who would do that?  Trump said. Comey's testimony was the most eagerly anticipated U.S. congressional hearing in years. The issue of the Trump election campaign's relationship with Russia has dogged Trump's first months in office and distracted from his policy goals such as overhauling the U.S. healthcare system and making tax cuts. Comey, who was fired by Trump in May, did not make any major disclosures about any links between Trump or his associates and alleged Russian meddling. Former FBI Director James Comey testifies before a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on Russia's alleged interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., June 8, 2017.Jonathan ErnstAsked on Friday if he would be willing to go under oath to give his version of his interactions with Comey, Trump replied,  100 percent.  He said he would be happy to speak to special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating allegations that Russia interfered with the election and colluded with Trump's campaign.  I would be glad to tell him exactly what I just told you,  Trump told a reporter. Slideshow (2 Images)Several congressional committees, as well as the FBI and Mueller, are looking into the Russia allegations. On Friday, the leaders of the House of Representatives intelligence committee's investigation said they had asked Comey for his notes and memos about his discussions with Trump, and asked the White House to produce any recordings or memos of conversations between Trump and Comey. Trump declined to answer questions from reporters about whether recordings existed.  I'll tell you about that maybe sometime in the very near future,  he said. Trump’s offer to testify under oath would pit his word against Comey’s before federal investigators. If either Trump’s testimony or memos written by Comey about his conversations with the president turn out to be untrue, either man could be charged with lying to federal investigators. A U.S. president is given a wide array of immunities from criminal prosecutions. The U.S. Constitution does not directly address whether the president can be criminally prosecuted, and the area is the subject of legal debate. A president can be charged after leaving office. Trump wrote earlier on Friday on Twitter that the former FBI head had vindicated him by telling the Senate Intelligence Committee that the president had not been personally under investigation in the Russia probe. With a single tweet, Trump also castigated Comey as  a leaker  for giving an account of his conversation with the president to a law professor who shared it with a news outlet.  Despite so many false statements and lies, total and complete vindication ... and WOW, Comey is a leaker!  Trump tweeted.

We should discuss it and examine whether such steps are necessary,  Sarreither told the Welt am Sonntag newspaper in an interview published on Saturday. France has a 24-hour ban on media reports that could affect a French election before polls open.  The measure helped to prevent more widespread reporting of a massive hack that released emails, documents and financing information just before campaigning ended ahead of the May election. The German government last month warned political parties to step up their defenses against hacking after the leak of emails  which belonged to the campaign of Emmanuel Macron before he was elected French president. The head of Germany's domestic intelligence agency in May accused Russian rivals of gathering large amounts of political data in cyber attacks that the Kremlin might decide to put to use ahead of Germany's September election. Russia denies any meddling in U.S. or European elections. Sarreither told the Welt am Sonntag that he had created a task force to examine the risks of a cyber attack on the German election, and the BSI federal cyber agency was continually testing the election network.  He said the testing had shown that certain elements of the system's information technology - which were two to three years old - required updates, but gave no further details. He said a major test of the election system and infrastructure was planned for the Saturday before the Sept. 24 election.

Hellickson kept the damage to three runs and fanned five, tying his season high originally set on April 21 against Atlanta. But the one pitch that consigned him to the loss was a 1-2 offering in the fifth that Aledmys Diaz swatted to the seats in left-center field for a homer. RF Aaron Altherr became the first Phillies player to collect two doubles and a triple in the same game since Odubel Herrera did it against the New York Mets two seasons ago. But Altherr's failure to catch a Matt Carpenter liner in the third inning helped kick-start a two-run St. Louis rally that tied the score. Although the ball was eventually judged as a hit after being originally ruled an error, it was a play that should have been made.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-phillies-playerwatch-idUSMTZED6ACCLPMH"},

The lawsuit, filed in January, said Trump violates the Constitution's  emoluments  clause, which bars him from accepting gifts from foreign governments without congressional approval, by maintaining ownership over his business empire despite ceding day-to-day control to his sons. In a filing in Manhattan federal court on Friday, the justice department argued that the plaintiffs in the case - an ethics non-profit, restaurant group and hotel events booker - do not have legal standing to sue.  The government also said payments to Trump's hotels do not qualify as a violation of the emoluments clause, which is intended to cover personal services performed by the president.  Plaintiffs' broad-brush claims effectively assert that the Constitution disqualifies the president from serving as president while maintaining ownership interests in his commercial businesses,  the department said in its court filing.

France has a 24-hour ban on media reports that could affect a French election before polls open.  The measure helped to prevent more widespread reporting of a massive hack that released emails, documents and financing information just before campaigning ended ahead of the May election. The German government last month warned political parties to step up their defenses against hacking after the leak of emails  which belonged to the campaign of Emmanuel Macron before he was elected French president.

West, who was so closely identified with Batman for the rest of his life that it was both a blessing and a curse for him, died on Friday evening after a short struggle with leukemia, his representative told Variety.   He was the greatest. We'll miss him like crazy,  his family said on the actor's Twitter page.  The live-action  Batman  show, starring West along with Burt Ward as his sidekick Robin and a collection of colorful villains, was inspired by a long-running comic book series. It ran only three seasons from 1966 to 1968 on the ABC network, but became a television phenomenon and cult classic. It also spawned a  Batman  feature film in 1966. West portrayed Batman and his alter ego Bruce Wayne as painfully earnest, straight-laced, clean-cut and trustworthy. The darker aspects of the Batman character - mined so successfully in later film versions - were ignored. The show's various memorable villains - Cesar Romero as the Joker, Frank Gorshin as the Riddler, Burgess Meredith as the Penguin and Julie Newmar as Catwoman - were allowed to chew the scenery. Numerous Hollywood luminaries stepped in to play Batman's demented adversaries in the show's 120 episodes.  He was bright, witty and fun to work with,  Newmar said on Saturday in a statement.  I will miss him in the physical world and savor him always in the world of imagination and creativity.        After the cancellation of the series, West found it difficult to land other acting jobs, even though he was an established film and TV actor, because he had become so linked to the Batman role. Eventually he came to accept that his identity was closely intertwined with the masked crime-fighting hero in the black cape whether he liked it or not. He often was hired to play a comically fictionalized version of himself in live-action and animated roles and became a successful voice actor. On the long-running animated series  Family Guy,  he provided the voice of the character Mayor Adam West. He played himself for years on the animated  The Fairly OddParents  and appeared on the venerable animated series  The Simpsons.  West also voiced the Caped Crusader and other characters in numerous animated incarnations of Batman. FILE PHOTO - Actor Adam West poses for photographers at a ceremony where he received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in Los Angeles April 5, 2012.Phil McCarten'Curious Stirrings'   We had some very good writers for the original show,  West said in a 2010 interview with the Slice of SciFi website.  They saw the craziness, the comedy. You know, just as he's about to put her in (jail), Batman says to Catwoman, 'You give me curious stirrings in my utility belt.' That's funny stuff.   In protecting Gotham City from super criminals, Batman and Robin invariably would find their lives threatened in some fiendish trap, only to escape using their endless ingenuity. For example, Robin was once nearly swallowed alive by a giant clam in an episode with the Joker. Batman and Robin were nearly turned into frozen desserts - Frosty Freezies - in an episode with famed film director Otto Preminger as Mr. Freeze. Slideshow (4 Images)Like some other actors who became inseparable in the minds of fans from a character they played - Leonard Nimoy as Mr. Spock on  Star Trek  is another example - West long resented his association with Batman but learned to like it.  I think it was a very simple deduction. I think any intelligent person would come to the same conclusion,  he said in 2010.  And that is: if I am being turned down for other roles because of my association with Batman, then maybe what I should do is really embrace Batman. Pursue it and keep it alive, which is what I've been trying to do for 30 years.  Bob Kane, who created Batman in 1939, seemed to agree. West kept a drawing of Batman by Kane, who inscribed it:  To my buddy, Adam, who breathed life into my pen and ink creation.  While struggling to land post-Batman acting roles, West turned to making personal appearances wearing the Batman cape and cowl - some rather undignified, as when he appeared on a Memphis pro wrestling program opposite wrestler Jerry  The King  Lawler. West was born as William  Billy  Anderson in Washington state in 1928. He took the name Adam West when he came to Hollywood in 1959. Pre- Batman,  he co-starred in the 1965 Three Stooges feature film  The Outlaws Is Coming  and the 1964 sci-fi film  Robinson Crusoe on Mars.  But it was his performance in a TV commercial that caught the notice of the  Batman  producers.  They'd seen a series of commercials I'd done for Nestle Quick instant milkshake in which I did a kind of spoof on the James Bond character,  West told Bizarre magazine in 2004.  They saw the commercials and thought, 'Hey, maybe this is the guy that can play the character in the way that we envision it.'

Without citing its sources, the newspaper said that while Neumann sees the sale to PSA as the right strategic step, he is concerned that the new owner is underestimating the growing importance of electric cars. Neumann planned to inform Opel's supervisory board about his decision at its next meeting on June 22, the paper said in an excerpt of an article to be published on Sunday, made available to Reuters on Saturday. Neumann wants to stay on board only until GM completes the sale of Opel to PSA Group, owner of the Peugeot, Citroen and DS brands, the newspaper added. Opel declined to comment.  Opel this week said the sale, valued at 2.2 billion euros  ($2.46 billion), could be completed as early as July 31, pending regulatory approval from antitrust authorities. Neumann said in an interview in March he planned to remain in his job even under Peugeot, citing  great respect for each other . Neumann's mooted departure from Opel comes as the position of a top executive at Neumann's former employer, Volkswagen Group (VOWG_p.DE), has been called into question in the wake of a scandal over rigged emissions tests. The embattled chief executive of VW's Audi division, Rupert Stadler, only got a five-year contract extension last month because of an agreement among supervisory board members that he would not serve out his full term, two sources have told Reuters. Opel's Neumann in 2013 joined GM to lead the U.S. carmaker's European operations, which include the Vauxhall brand, after losing out in a management reshuffle at Volkswagen.

Our president has also stressed the need to resolve this upsetting issue before the end of Ramadan, as it is against our religion, beliefs, and traditions, especially during the month of Ramadan,  Cavusoglu said. Sheikh Khaled, in comments translated from Arabic to Turkish, said he had told Erdogan about the actions of Qatar which led to the dispute, and added that there should be a guarantee that Qatar will not continue its current actions.

Turkish mass-circulation newspaper Hurriyet reported on Friday that after an initial deployment of Turkish troops at a base in Doha, Turkish warplanes and ships will also be sent. It said a Turkish delegation would go to Qatar in the coming days to assess the situation at the base.

Erdogan also approved another accord between Turkey and Qatar on military training cooperation late on Thursday. Both bills were drawn up before the dispute erupted. Turkey has also pledged to provide food and water supplies to Qatar. Turkey has maintained good relations with Qatar as well as several of its Gulf Arab neighbors. Turkey and Qatar have both provided support for the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt and backed rebels fighting to overthrow Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.

ACT for America, a self-described grassroots organization focusing on national security issues, has scheduled protests in New York, Chicago, Boston, Denver and Seattle, as well as many smaller cities. Hundreds of people pledged on social media to attend. At a rally on the steps of the Pennsylvania state capitol in Harrisburg, the atmosphere was tense. Barricades and a heavy police presence, including officers mounted on horses, separated about 60 anti-sharia demonstrators from an equal number of counter-protesters, most of them in black face masks and hoods. Nearly dozen men carrying sidearms belonging to the anti-government Oath Keepers were on hand, invited by ACT to provide security. On its website, ACT described sharia, which covers many aspects of Muslim life including religious obligations and financial dealings, as incompatible with human rights. It said sharia justifies the oppression of women and homosexuality, and advocate female genital mutilation. But critics say the organization vilifies Muslims and has repeatedly equated Islam with extremism. In their view, the rallies are part of a wave of anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant sentiment fueled by President Donald Trump, who called for an outright ban on Muslims entering the country during his election campaign. A representative for ACT for America could not be reached for comment. The Council on American-Islamic Relations, the country's largest Muslim advocacy group, urged Americans to participate in one of several local educational events being organized in  a peaceful challenge to Saturday's hate rallies.  It also warned Muslims to take extra precautions against potential violence over the weekend. Oath Keepers said on its website that it was  answering the call to defend free speech against those who would use terrorist violence or the threat of violence to shut it down.  It describes itself as a  nonpartisan association of current and former military, police, and first responders  sworn to defend the U.S. Constitution. The Southern Poverty Law Center says it is the  one of the largest radical antigovernment group in the United States,  organized around a  set of baseless conspiracy theories.  Refuse Fascism, a coalition of activists advocating confrontational tactics to oppose what it calls the Trump  regime,  said it would show up at the rallies  to counter the xenophobic hatred and lies, defy intimidation and drown it out.” It said anti-sharia organizers were actually  against all Muslims  and were creating a climate in which extremists felt emboldened to carry out attacks on Muslims.

The winning bid came in the closing seconds of the five-day eBay auction, which drew 41 bids before ending on Friday night. It was lower than the record $3,456,789 bid in similar auctions in 2012 and 2016. Money will go to Glide, a San Francisco charity that provides food, health care and other services to the homeless, the impoverished, and people struggling with substance abuse. The successful bidder and up to seven friends will dine with Buffett at the Smith & Wollensky steak house in Manhattan. All topics are fair game apart from where Buffett will invest next. Buffett has held 18 annual auctions for Glide, raising about $26.3 million. He became involved with Glide after his first wife, Susan, became a volunteer, prior to her death in 2004.  We are very delighted and proud that Mr. Buffett has for years made sure that he participates,  the Rev. Cecil Williams, 87, co-founder of Glide and pastor since 1963 of the Glide Memorial United Methodist Church, said after the auction ended. Contributions have a  tremendous impact  on people who find themselves  really unable to come to grips with the issue of poverty in urban America,  Williams said. Glide uses its $18 million annual budget to provide more than 750,000 free meals, emergency shelter for 8,500 people, 2,600 HIV and Hepatitis C tests, and day care and after school programs for nearly 450 children. Buffett, 86, is the world's fourth-richest person, worth $76.2 billion according to Forbes magazine. He is donating virtually all of his fortune to charity. Past auction winners have included hedge fund manager Ted Weschler, who paid a combined $5.25 million to win two auctions. He later became one of Buffett's investing deputies, and along with fellow deputy Todd Combs is likely to oversee Berkshire's stock investments after Buffett departs. Berkshire has more than 90 businesses in the insurance, energy, industrial, railroad, retail and other sectors. Buffett owns about 18 percent of the $419 billion company.

Merkel is ready for dissent at the meeting, however, after U.S. President Donald Trump's withdrawal from a global climate change agreement, they said. Merkel told an audience in Argentina on Friday that as host of the G20, she would have to be up front about differences if all 20 highly industrialized countries failed to see eye to eye on climate and other issues, as the final communique requires unanimous consent.  There will be issues where not everyone gets what we want,  Merkel said, a clear nod to Trump's move to pull out of the 2015 Paris accord to combat climate change days after refusing to endorse it at summits in Europe. At the same time, Merkel, a strong advocate of the Paris accord, must stay true to her views at home, where she is seeking a fourth term in office in September national elections and where Trump remains deeply unpopular. During visits to Argentina and Mexico, Merkel highlighted her shared views with the leaders of both countries on climate change, trade and other issues.  Germany is looking for allies on issues that are important to us,  Merkel said after a meeting with Argentine President Mauricio Macri. German magazine Der Spiegel reported on Saturday that her staff have drawn up a 13-page paper for the July G20 summit that includes specific references to the 2015 Paris agreement - setting up a potential showdown with Trump. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has suggested striking out the references to enable Trump to sign the communique, the magazine reported. Government sources say Merkel needs Trump's support to make the G20 summit a success, however, and his willingness to compromise could wane if he perceives her as his enemy. Indeed, she told students in Buenos Aires that it was vital to maintain dialogue even with those who hold different views.  Because if I talk with someone, I can no longer simply say he is stupid,  she said. Complicating the issue further for Merkel, however, her foreign minister Sigmar Gabriel of junior coalition partners the Social Democrats, wants as many G20 countries as possible to underscore their continued support for the Paris deal at the July summit.  The G20 cannot result in a silent unity against the climate agreement,  he told the magazine. A recent poll by Infratest dimap showed that only 21 percent of German voters viewed the United States as a reliable partner, a drop of eight percentage points from April that put it on the same level as Russia and far below China on 36 percent.

A senior Conservative lawmaker was in Belfast on Saturday for talks with the DUP, a spokeswoman for May's office said. The DUP has refused to give details in public of what concessions it might seek, and did not respond to a request for comment.  The source said the DUP was likely to seek a role in Brexit negotiations but was likely to steer clear of social issues such as abortion and gay rights, where it disagrees with Conservative Party positions.  It was also likely to seek to include Northern Ireland in the  Military Covenant , which ensures that veterans of the British armed forces receive priority medical treatment in the remainder of the United Kingdom. Such a move would be strongly opposed by the Irish nationalists of Sinn Fein who share power in Belfast under a 1998 peace agreement that ended three decades of violence between nationalists and pro-British loyalists.

Slideshow (3 Images)During a visit to NATO headquarters last month in Brussels, Trump had pointedly not mentioned U.S. support for the critical portion of the NATO charter. He used his speech there to demand that members pay more for the alliance's defense. A senior White House official later had said the United States does in fact support Article 5 simply by agreeing to the terms of the charter. But having not mentioned it himself, Trump sowed some doubts among allies and the ensuing controversy prompted Vice President Mike Pence to later express explicit U.S. support for the charter. Senior aides to Trump had tried to get a statement of explicit support for Article 5 in the president's NATO speech but it was not included, a senior administration official said.  I'm committing the United States to Article 5 and certainly we are there to protect and that's one of the reasons that I want people to make sure we have a very, very strong force by paying the kind of money necessary to have that force,  Trump said.

The catastrophe is already upon us,  Mueller said in an interview with the German newspaper Passauer Neue Presse,  published on Saturday. He pointed to dire conditions in countries such as Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan and Ethiopia. Mueller said the United Nations estimated the financial needs in eastern Africa alone amounted to $4 billion to $5 billion. Creating a fund that would be continually restocked would make it easier to respond to recurring humanitarian crises, he said.    We need to accomplish this as a world community,  he said.  Ethiopia, for example, will run out of emergency food aid for 7.8 million people hit by severe drought by the end of this month, the Ethiopian government and humanitarian groups have said. The United Nations said in March that more than 20 million people risk dying from starvation because of drought and conflict in Yemen, Somalia, South Sudan and northeast Nigeria, while more than 100 million face acute malnutrition worldwide. Famine was declared in some areas of South Sudan in February - the first official famine in six years. Mueller spoke ahead of a conference in Berlin on Monday that Germany is hosting to call more attention to Africa during its presidency of the Group of 20 industrialized countries. Five countries - Ivory Coast, Morocco, Rwanda, Senegal and Tunisia - have already signed up for enhanced partnership agreements with G20 countries under a new  Compact with Africa  program. It focuses on finding private investors in areas such as  energy production, agriculture and tourism. Ghana and Ethiopia have expressed interest in such partnerships, according to German officials.

Qatari banks have around 60 billion riyals ($16 billion) in funding in the form of customer and interbank deposits from other Gulf states, Chiradeep Ghosh, banking analyst at SICO Bahrain, said.  All types of deposits at banks in Qatar totaled 753 billion riyals at the end of March, according to central bank data. But the United Arab Emirates central bank has ordered local banks to stop dealing with the 59 individuals and 12 entities with alleged links to Qatar and to freeze their assets, state news agency WAM reported late on Friday. It has also told them to apply enhanced due diligence for any accounts they hold with six Qatari banks, including Qatar National Bank (QNBK.QA) (QNB) which is the Middle East and Africa’s largest bank, WAM said in its report The six banks -- QNB, Qatar Islamic Bank (QISB.QA), Qatar International Islamic Bank (QIIB.QA), Barwa Bank IPO-BABK.QA, Masraf Al Rayan (MARK.QA) and Doha Bank (DOBK.QA) -- did not respond immediately to requests for comment. Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Egypt and Bahrain had earlier branded as terrorists the same individuals, including Muslim Brotherhood spiritual leader Yousef al-Qaradawi, and entities including Qatari-funded charities Qatar Charity and Eid Charity. Vehicles stop at a red light in front of the main branch of UAE Central Bank in Abu Dhabi, January 29, 2013.Ben JobThe move followed the isolation of Qatar by the four states, which have cut all diplomatic and transport links. This pressure is likely to constrain the funding Qatari banks would be able to raise from Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Bahrain, one banker in the region told Reuters.  All Qatari banks will struggle for liquidity and will have to pay a premium for funding from elsewhere outside these four countries,  SICO Bahrain's Ghosh said. Qatari banks, like their Gulf neighbors, have been struggling against a backdrop of lower oil prices, which has pushed up funding costs and raised non-performing loans.  It is especially challenging as they're not very liquid as their loan to deposit ratios are already above 100 percent,  Ghosh said. In recent years several have also expanded outside Qatar’s small domestic market to grow their business, with QNB holding a presence in several countries including Egypt, Turkey, Nigeria and UAE either directly or via affiliates. UAE banks would find it relatively easy to comply with the rules as many had invested in improving their compliance systems in recent years and already complied with sanctions against a range of other entities and individuals, another banker said.

May's Conservatives failed to secure an absolute majority in a parliamentary election on Thursday and need the DUP's 10 seats to be sure of being able to form a government. A senior Conservative lawmaker was in Belfast on Saturday for talks with the DUP, a spokeswoman for May's office said. The DUP has refused to give details in public of what concessions it might seek, and did not respond to a request for comment. The source said the DUP was likely to seek a role in Brexit negotiations but was likely to steer clear of social issues such as abortion and gay rights, where it disagrees with Conservative Party positions. It was also likely to seek to include Northern Ireland in the  Military Covenant , which ensures that veterans of the British armed forces receive priority medical treatment in the remainder of the United Kingdom. Such a move would be strongly opposed by the Irish nationalists of Sinn Fein who share power in Belfast under a 1998 peace agreement that ended three decades of violence between nationalists and pro-British loyalists.

The winning bid came in the closing seconds of the five-day eBay auction, which drew 41 bids before ending on Friday night. It was lower than the record $3,456,789 bid in similar auctions in 2012 and 2016. Money will go to Glide, a San Francisco charity that provides food, health care and other services to the homeless, the impoverished, and people struggling with substance abuse. The successful bidder and up to seven friends will dine with Buffett at the Smith & Wollensky steak house in Manhattan. All topics are fair game apart from where Buffett will invest next. Buffett has held 18 annual auctions for Glide, raising about $26.3 million. He became involved with Glide after his first wife, Susan, became a volunteer, prior to her death in 2004.  We are very delighted and proud that Mr. Buffett has for years made sure that he participates,  the Rev. Cecil Williams, 87, co-founder of Glide and pastor since 1963 of the Glide Memorial United Methodist Church, said after the auction ended. Contributions have a  tremendous impact  on people who find themselves  really unable to come to grips with the issue of poverty in urban America,  Williams said. Glide uses its $18 million annual budget to provide more than 750,000 free meals, emergency shelter for 8,500 people, 2,600 HIV and Hepatitis C tests, and day care and after school programs for nearly 450 children. Buffett, 86, is the world's fourth-richest person, worth $76.2 billion according to Forbes magazine. He is donating virtually all of his fortune to charity. Past auction winners have included hedge fund manager Ted Weschler, who paid a combined $5.25 million to win two auctions. He later became one of Buffett's investing deputies, and along with fellow deputy Todd Combs is likely to oversee Berkshire's stock investments after Buffett departs. Berkshire has more than 90 businesses in the insurance, energy, industrial, railroad, retail and other sectors. Buffett owns about 18 percent of the $419 billion company. The lunches that fetched $3,456,789 remain the most expensive items sold on eBay where all proceeds went to charity. Bidding moved online in 2003.

Three Islamist militants rammed a hired van into pedestrians on London Bridge last Saturday before going on the rampage through the bustling Borough Market area, where they slit throats and stabbed people. Three French people, two Australians, one Canadian, a Spanish man and a Briton were killed in the attack, and almost 50 wounded. Police shot the attackers dead just eight minutes after the first call from the public.  Metropolitan Police Commissioner Dick said she understood that people were concerned about security after the attacks in London and Manchester, but that the British capital would not be intimidated.  London is a safe city and we will do everything we can in our power to keep you safe,  she said in an interview at London police headquarters, just a few steps away from Westminster Bridge, where an attacker killed five people on March 22.  We won't let them win and London will carry on,  she said, adding that security services had foiled five plots since then. Dick, an Oxford University graduate, was appointed London's first female police chief and Britain's top officer in February, taking charge of a force of 43,000 officers and staff with a budget of more than 3 billion pounds ($3.8 billion). Baptism of Fire She officially started the job less than three weeks after Khalid Masood drove a car into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge, and then stabbed a policeman to death in the grounds of parliament. Then, eight weeks later, three Islamists staged a carbon-copy attack on London Bridge. The spate of recent attacks - the deadliest in Britain since four British Islamist suicide bombers killed 52 people on the London transport system in July 2005 - thrust security and policing to the fore of the campaign for last Thursday's election. Prime Minister Theresa May, a former interior minister, came under particular scrutiny for cuts to the police. Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick speaks during at interview with Reuters at New Scotland Yard, Westminster, Britain June 10, 2017.Clodagh KilcoyneAsked if the Metropolitan Police needed more resources, Dick said:  We will want more resources to help us and I am sure the same will be being said in the intelligence agencies.  Obviously we will be reviewing, for example, the number of armed officers we have and how they work, and a whole host of other things that are likely, from my point of view, to take more resources, and I will be asking for them.  After the London Bridge attack, May said Britain was under threat from a new breed of crude copycat militants who did not spend months planning and may not have been radicalised online.  We Will Step Up a Gear  Slideshow (8 Images) We are highly effective at preventing attacks in this country and we will step up a gear and do our level best to stop any further attacks,  Dick said, urging those hiring out vehicles to be vigilant.  But, as you point out, highly volatile people who are intent on doing something absolutely terrible and who are quite happy - maybe even pleased - to kill themselves and to use low-tech methods - these are difficult things to defend against.  On the day of the London Bridge attack, the three men had initially tried to hire a 7.5 tonne (8.3 ton) truck, the head of London police's counter-terrorism unit said on Friday. Dick, who left the police to work in the Foreign Office in 2015 before taking up her new role, said the militant threat was largely domestic.  The majority of them have a domestic focus, if I can put it that way, a domestic center of gravity,  she said.  However, there are international connections and links in many of them.  Although the Islamic State group has claimed responsibility for the London Bridge attack, police have said there was no evidence that the perpetrators - Pakistani-born Briton Khuram Butt, Italian Youssef Zaghba and Rachid Redouane, who had links to Libya, Morocco and Ireland - were directed by anyone else, either in Britain or abroad. Dick said it was common for Islamic State to make claims about attacks that it had not been directly involved in.

Commander Dean Haydon also revealed that the men had a stockpile of petrol bombs in the back of their van and carried out their deadly attack with pink ceramic knives. Officers also discovered a Koran in their safe house, opened at a page on martyrdom. The discoveries, especially of the plan to hire a truck, suggested more could have been killed.  Getting hold of a 7.5 tonne lorry - the effects could have been even worse,  Haydon told reporters.  Although Islamic State militants have claimed responsibility for the attack, Haydon said there was no evidence the attackers - Pakistani-born Briton Khuram Butt, Italian Youssef Zaghba and Rachid Redouane who had links to Libya, Morocco and Ireland - were directed by anyone else, either in Britain or abroad.  We're not looking for a wider network,  said Haydon, head of London's Counter Terrorism Command, adding that officers were still trying to piece together how the three men had met.  How did they know each other? They are a diverse bunch,  he said.  Haydon provided unusually extensive details of last Saturday's attack, the deadliest in London since suicide bombers killed 52 people on the city's transport network in 2005. Ringleader On Saturday morning, Butt, who Haydon said was believed to be the ringleader, tried to rent a 7.5 tonne truck but did not provided payment details.  Related CoverageLondon will not be cowed by militants, police chief saysBritish police arrest 27-year-old man in London Bridge attack probeIt was not clear why he could not pay, or if he lacked the necessary license to drive such a vehicle. But his attempt echoed last July's attack in Nice, France, when a 19-tonne truck was driven into crowds, killing 86 people. Shortly before 1700 GMT, Butt received a text message confirming his hire of a Renault van instead. At about 1730 GMT, the men drove to pick up the van before heading to Zaghba's home in east London. At 1838 GMT they left and two hours later the van reached London Bridge which they drove along twice before targeting pedestrians on the sidewalk on their third run. Three people on the bridge were struck and killed by the van, believed to have been driven by Butt, before the men abandoned the vehicle and began to attack people in bars and restaurants in the nearby bustling Borough Market area. The men were armed with identical 12-inch (30cm) pink ceramic knives, strapped to their wrists with leather bound around the handle. They were also wearing fake suicide belts - plastic water bottles wrapped in duct tape. People look at floral tributes near London Bridge, London, Britain, June 8, 2017.Marko DjuricaEight minutes after police were alerted, armed officers arrived at the scene and fired 46 rounds, killing all three men. Their victims were three French nationals, two Australians, a Canadian, a Spaniard and a Briton. In the attackers' van detectives found 13 wine bottles, filled with lighter fuel with rags wrapped round them to make Molotov cocktail petrol bombs. There were also two blow torches which Haydon thought could have been used to light the homemade bombs as part of a possible secondary attack.  They were still fairly close to the van. There is a possibility that they could have come back,  Haydon said. There were also office chairs, a suitcase and two bags of gravel which Haydon said might have been to add weight or to act as a cover story for their activities to friends and family.   He said Redouane's home, an apartment in Barking, east London, was the men's safe house where they put their plot together and prepared the attack.  There they found an English-language copy of the Koran which had been left open on a page describing martyrdom, along with other items linked to their attack. Haydon said since last Saturday they had taken 262 statements from people from 19 different countries and numerous international inquiries were ongoing relating to the attackers and the victims. Criticism British police and security services were criticized after it emerged that they had known about Butt, who featured in a TV documentary entitled  Jihadis Next Door , in which he joined a group unfurling an Islamic State (IS) flag in a park.   Haydon acknowledged that Butt had links to al Muhajiroun, a banned group headed by cleric Anjem Choudary. He was jailed last year for encouraging support of IS, which has been linked to numerous militant plots in Britain and abroad. Butt was also arrested for fraud last October but was about to be told by prosecutors he would face no further action.  We will be looking at intelligence and our processes, and asking ourselves the question: 'Could we have prevented such an attack?',  Haydon said.  There is nothing that I'm seeing at the moment that suggested that we got that wrong.  Police have installed security barriers running alongside the sidewalks at eight bridges across the River Thames, and Haydon said similar protection was being considered at other locations. Police were also reviewing security at  iconic sites , crowded places and major events, and refreshing advice to theaters, bars, shopping centers and sports venues.

Prosecutors in  Operation Bullish  have spotted sources of potential crimes involving the approval and disbursement of loans worth billions of reais from state development bank BNDES [BNDES.UL] to the Batistas' investment holding company J&F; Investimentos SA, according to Estado.

Marx was not convinced that all crimes committed by J&F; and the Batistas have been unearthed, Estado reported, citing people with direct knowledge of Marx's thinking. In the event Marx and his team decide to move forward with Operation Bullish, the fine could rise further, Estado said without elaborating.

The Superior Justice Tribunal, Brazil's top appeals court, rejected on Friday claims by some OAS creditors that the sale of a 24.4 percent stake in Invepar SA be stopped. The decision allowed creditors to convene an assembly on June 22 to decide how to take ownership of the stake, the sources said. According to the sources, who requested anonymity to discuss the deal, the court's decision will speed up talks between the creditors and Mubadala. Under preliminary terms of the deal, Mubadala proposed to inject fresh capital into Invepar to kick-start projects and cut debt, sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters in February. A sale, which could be announced at some point during the third quarter, would trigger a reworking of the shareholder accord between OAS and the three Brazilian pension funds that own a combined 75.6 percent of Invepar, the sources said. The Reuters report in February said Mubadala would pump fresh capital into Invepar to rework that accord, diluting the stakes that Previ Caixa de Previdência do Banco do Brasil SA , Petros Fundação Petrobras SA and Funcef Fundação have in Invepar. OAS declined to comment. Efforts to reach a Mubadala spokesman in Abu Dhabi after working hours were unsuccessful. Some of the OAS creditors that won the right to the Invepar stake declined to comment. Formally known as Investimentos & Participacoes em Infraestrutura SA, Invepar operates toll road, airport and urban mobility licenses, including São Paulo's GRU international airport and the MetrôRio and VLT Carioca urban transport projects in Rio de Janeiro. A new partner would help Invepar cut debt and jumpstart investments that snagged amid Brazil's harshest recession ever, surging borrowing costs and the involvement of OAS in the nation's worst corruption scandal. The creditor group wants to sell the stake for a value  north of  2.2 billion reais ($668 million), the sources said.

Qatari banks have around 60 billion riyals ($16 billion) in funding in the form of customer and interbank deposits from other Gulf states, Chiradeep Ghosh, banking analyst at SICO Bahrain, said. All types of deposits at banks in Qatar totalled 753 billion riyals at the end of March, according to central bank data. But the United Arab Emirates central bank has ordered local banks to stop dealing with the 59 individuals and 12 entities with alleged links to Qatar and to freeze their assets, state news agency WAM reported late on Friday. It has also told them to apply enhanced due diligence for any accounts they hold with six Qatari banks, including Qatar National Bank (QNB) which is the Middle East and Africa’s largest bank, WAM said in its report The six banks -- QNB, Qatar Islamic Bank, Qatar International Islamic Bank, Barwa Bank IPO-BABK.QA, Masraf Al Rayan and Doha Bank -- did not respond immediately to requests for comment. Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Egypt and Bahrain had earlier branded as terrorists the same individuals, including Muslim Brotherhood spiritual leader Yousef al-Qaradawi, and entities including Qatari-funded charities Qatar Charity and Eid Charity. The move followed the isolation of Qatar by the four states, which have cut all diplomatic and transport links. This pressure is likely to constrain the funding Qatari banks would be able to raise from Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Bahrain, one banker in the region told Reuters.  All Qatari banks will struggle for liquidity and will have to pay a premium for funding from elsewhere outside these four countries,  SICO Bahrain's Ghosh said. Qatari banks, like their Gulf neighbours, have been struggling against a backdrop of lower oil prices, which has pushed up funding costs and raised non-performing loans.  It is especially challenging as they're not very liquid as their loan to deposit ratios are already above 100 percent,  Ghosh said. In recent years several have also expanded outside Qatar’s small domestic market to grow their business, with QNB holding a presence in several countries including Egypt, Turkey, Nigeria and UAE either directly or via affiliates. UAE banks would find it relatively easy to comply with the rules as many had invested in improving their compliance systems in recent years and already complied with sanctions against a range of other entities and individuals, another banker said.

Successive failed rains blamed by meteorologists on fluctuations in ocean temperatures known as the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) have created a series of severe back-to-back droughts in Ethiopia and the Horn of Africa region.  In Ethiopia, the number of people now critically short of food is expected to rise by at least two million by next month, according to figures compiled by the government and its humanitarian partners.  Donors, international aid groups and the government say existing food aid for the current 7.8 million will run out as funds are critically short this year with Ethiopia receiving slightly more than half of the $930 million to meet requirements until July.  We are in a dire situation,  John Aylieff, the World Food Programme's representative in Ethiopia, said on Friday during a field trip to Warder in southeast Ethiopia, one of Ethiopia's hardest-hit areas.  We've got food running out nationally at the end of June. That means the 7.8 million people who are in need of humanitarian food assistance in Ethiopia will see that distribution cut abruptly at the end of June,  he added. Treeless Plains Humanitarian groups fear donor fatigue is weighing on efforts to meet requirements.   Famine in northeast Nigeria, together with South Sudan, Yemen and Somalia, constitute the worst humanitarian crisis the world has faced since 1945, the U.N. said in March.  There is donor fatigue because there are a lot of crises,  said Ahmed Al Meraikhi, the U.N. Secretary-General's humanitarian envoy. Addis Ababa allocated $272 million extra in 2015 and a further $109 million last year from its own coffers to deal with the drought. However the government said it faced difficulties in sustaining similar targets this year.  Last year, we spent a lot of money to confront this type of drought. It is very challenging,  said Mitiku Kassa, head of Ethiopia's National Disaster Risk Management Commission. Across the Horn of Africa, close to 17 million people need humanitarian aid due to drought, including 2.6 million in Kenya and 3.2 million in Somalia, according to the U.N. In the treeless plains littered with makeshift plastic homes in Ethiopia's Warder, bordering Somalia, displaced and destitute pastoralists said their entire herds had been decimated.  We have had droughts before, but this time we have drought, diarrhea and disease,  said Ardo Yusuf, a 49-year old mother who said her entire livestock had succumbed to illness.

Her Conservatives struck an outline deal with Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) for support on key legislation. It was a humiliating outcome after an election that May had intended to strengthen her ahead of the Brexit push. Instead, voters stripped the Conservatives of their parliamentary majority. As May struggled to contain the fallout, her two closest aides resigned.  Newspapers said foreign minister Boris Johnson and other leading party members were weighing leadership challenges. But Johnson said he backed May. May called the early election in April, when opinion polls suggested she was set for a sweeping win. May's aides, Nick Timothy and Fiona Hill quit on Saturday following sustained criticism within the party of the campaign.  Gavin Barwell was named new chief of staff. The Conservative lawmaker who lost his seat on Thursday and has experience working as a party enforcer in parliament. The change was unlikely to significantly quell unrest within the party. Most of May's cabinet members have kept quiet on the issue of her future, adding to speculation that her days as prime minister are numbered. A YouGov poll for the Sunday Times newspaper found 48 percent of people felt May should quit while 38 percent thought she should stay. More Complicated The DUP, whose 10 seats in the new parliament give May just enough support to pass legislation, agreed in principle to a  confidence and supply  arrangement, Downing Street said. That means it will support a Conservative minority government on key votes in parliament without a formal coalition deal. Related CoverageNorthern Ireland's DUP says still to reach agreement on supporting UK PM May's governmentA source close to the DUP said the party was seeking more funding for the province and concessions for former British soldiers in exchange for supporting May. Still the deal with the DUP risks upsetting the political balance in Northern Ireland. It aligns London more closely with the pro-British side in the divided province, where a power-sharing government with Irish nationalists is suspended. The Observer newspaper said the DUP arrangement fell short of a full coalition agreement because of concerns among some Conservative lawmakers about the socially conservative DUP's positions on gay rights, abortion and climate change. The turmoil engulfing May has increased the chance that Britain will fall out of the EU in 2019 without a deal. Previously, she said she wanted to take Britain out of the EU's single market and customs union in order to cut immigration.     Her party is deeply divided over what it wants from Brexit. The election result means businesses still have no idea what trading rules they can expect in the coming years.   EU Budget Commissioner Guenther Oettinger said it may now be possible to discuss closer ties between Britain and the EU than May had initially planned, given her election flop.  Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May addresses the country after Britain's election at Downing Street in London, Britain June 9, 2017.Stefan Wermuth For instance, if London were to stay in the customs union, then it would not have to renegotiate all trade agreements,  he told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung newspaper.  The pound on Friday fell 1.7 percent against the U.S. dollar and 1.4 percent against the euro. After confirming on Friday that her top five ministers, including finance minister Philip Hammond, would keep their jobs, May must name the rest of her team, who will take on one of the most demanding jobs in recent British political history.  May has said Brexit talks will begin on June 19 as scheduled, the same day as the formal reopening of parliament. She confirmed this to German leader Angela Merkel in a phone call on Saturday.  She also reiterated that she would seek a reciprocal agreement early in the talks on rights of EU and British citizens, Downing Street said.      Elmar Brok, a German conservative and the European Parliament's top Brexit expert, told the Ruhr Nachrichten newspaper that the two-year talks would now be more complicated.  Slideshow (5 Images) May won't be able to make any compromises because she lacks a broad parliamentary majority,  he said.  She's Staying - for Now   Britain's largely pro-Conservative press questioned whether May could remain in power.  The Sun newspaper said senior members of the party had vowed to get rid of May, but would wait at least six months because they feared a leadership contest could propel the Labour party into power under Jeremy Corbyn, who supports renationalization of key industries and higher taxes for business and top earners. Survation, the opinion polling firm that came closest to predicting correctly the election's outcome, said a new poll it conducted for the Mail on Sunday newspaper showed support for Labour now 6 percentage points ahead of the Conservatives.     She's staying, for now,  one Conservative Party source told Reuters. Former Conservative cabinet minister Owen Paterson, asked about her future, said:  Let's see how it pans out.  May had repeatedly ruled out the need for a new election before changing her mind. Labour stunned even its own supporters by taking enough seats from the Conservatives to deny them a majority. The Times newspaper's front page declared that Britain was  effectively leaderless  and the country  all but ungovernable .  The Conservatives have not yet broken the British system of democracy, but through their hubris and incompetence they have managed to make a mockery of it,  it said in an editorial.  If May is to honor the wish of the 52 percent of voters who opted last year to take Britain out of the EU, she must find a way to bridge the differences within her party. Its eurosceptic wing has long been a thorn in the side of Conservative prime ministers. On the other hand, pro-Europe Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said she wanted to be involved in  looking again  at Britain's aims for Brexit. Davidson was one of the few Conservative success stories in the election as the Scottish wing of the party won 13 seats.  She has said she favors retaining the greatest possible level of access to Europe's single market.

Renzi said he saw little hope of reforming the electoral system after a deal between the four largest parties broke down this week, meaning Italy will probably vote with a system considered inefficient and unlikely to produce a majority. In an interview with daily Corriere della Sera, Renzi denied that he wanted to go to the polls this autumn, as was widely believed, and when asked when he expected the election he replied:  in 2018, at the end of the legislature.  Italy's two largest parties, the PD and the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement, have blamed each other since a deal on switching to a new proportional representation electoral system based on the German model collapsed on Thursday.  It was our duty to try (for an accord) but now the game is over,  Renzi said.  We have a horizon of nearly a year until the elections, so let's work for Italy.  He said the election, which must be held by May 2018, could be held using the current system which involves different voting rules for the two houses of parliament, and which President Sergio Mattarella had asked the parties to reform. In a separate interview in the same newspaper, 5-Star deputy Luigi Di Maio, widely expected to be the movement's candidate for prime minister, also said he believed the election would be fought in 2018 using the current system.  There are no longer the conditions in this parliament to  reform the electoral law,  he said. Despite the standoff, the main parties voted in the Chamber of Deputies last week to resume negotiations over electoral reform in a parliamentary committee. The PD and 5-Star are Italy's most popular parties, each commanding around 30 percent of voter support, according to opinion polls. The latest poll, published in Corriere on Saturday, put 5-Star on 30.6 percent and the PD on 29.3 percent.

Traders said the previous zero tolerance requirement, which an Egyptian agricultural department said was to protect human and plant health, is impossible to fulfill and makes doing business with Egypt too risky. But an Egyptian court said this week it was planning to overturn a food inspection system launched this year by the world's largest wheat buyer which was intended to address this issue and streamline trade after a nearly year-long row. The new inspection system sidelined a body called agriculture quarantine which last year applied a zero tolerance rule on ergot in wheat cargoes and led traders to boycott the state's tenders en masse, briefly cutting off the import-dependent country from global grain markets. Lawyers on the case told Reuters that the ruling, scheduled to be issued on June 13, would restore the agriculture quarantine's authorities, which could allow them to again ban the fungus entirely from wheat cargoes. But in its first comments since news of the pending court ruling, GASC Vice Chairman Ahmed Youssef said the court ruling would not mean a return to the zero tolerance rule.  The court ruling is procedural and administrative and has nothing to do with specifications,  he told Reuters.  GASC is sticking to the Egyptian specifications of 2010,  said Youssef, referring to a regulation that permits up to 0.05 percent ergot in wheat imports.  We have taken this view after consultations with the Agriculture Ministry,  said Youssef, suggesting that the quarantine, which falls under the Agriculture Ministry, may not be permitted to reinstate the ban even if it regains its previous powers. The new system was imposed by a decree in November that named the General Organization for Export and Import Control (GOEIC), which is part of the trade ministry, as the body responsible for inspecting the imports.  GASC, which is holding a wheat purchase tender on Saturday, is permitting up to 0.05 percent ergot, a common international standard, in its tender books.

Dick spoke in an interview with Reuters. Following are the highlights: Q. Is London safe?  I know people will be concerned about what's happened in the UK over the past 12 weeks including the two ghastly attacks in London, but London is a wonderful international city and we attract visitors from all over the world all the time and we love it because it is so diverse. London is open. People are going about their business.  London is a safe city and we will do everything we can in our power to keep you safe.  We won't let them win and London will carry on.  Q. How can the police and security services defend against what Prime Minister Theresa May has called a new breed of crude copycat militants?  This threat that we now face is a global phenomenon and in this respect London is similar to other cities in the Western world. Sadly we have seen such attacks elsewhere. We need to continue to learn and adapt as a nation and indeed as a police service.  But some of the things that we have always done are very important in this situation. We have excellent relationships with our communities and we need people to give us information more than they ever have done.  We have a fantastic relationship with the intelligence agencies and a great ability to analyse intelligence. We need to do that ever more and ever better.  We need people to be really alert. As an example in this particular attack, we know that the attackers hired a vehicle that very day. So we need, for example, people who are hiring vans and lorries out to just think about who these people are and if you have any concerns at all to contact us on the anti-terrorist hotline.  Q. In the London Bridge attack, armed police shot dead the three attackers just eight minutes after the first phone call from the public. How prepared are the police?  Ever since the appalling attacks in Mumbai there have been other similar, what we would call, marauding terrorist attacks, we have tried to build up our capability, skill and understanding of how to tackle them.  At any one time we have a large number of highly trained specialist firearms officers who are very mobile and strategically placed. They are able to respond exceptionally quickly and with great professionalism and efficiency and as you saw there with great courage.  Q. Can we expect more such attacks and how is it possible to defend against such crude attacks?  We have been doing everything we can to find out who was behind these attacks. We believe that those three people planned and executed the attack. We are still investigating to find out whether anyone else knew about it or supported it in any way.  We are highly effective at preventing attacks in this country and we will step up a gear and do our level best to stop any further attacks. But as you point out, highly volatile people who are intent on doing something absolutely terrible and who are quite happy - maybe even pleased - to kill themselves and to use a low tech methods - these are difficult things to defend against.  Q. Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack on London Bridge, so is this a domestic or international threat?  My observation is that in relation to the threat that we have been facing most recently and the attacks that have been successful and those that have been unsuccessful, the majority of them have a domestic focus if I can put it that way, a domestic centre of gravity. However there are international connections and links in many of them. On the Islamic State claim:  This is quite common. On occasion Daesh [Daesh is an Arabic acronym for Islamic State] and other organisations will claim responsibility when long and careful investigations by intelligence agencies here and overseas and a sober assessment would subsequently say actually 'not at all'. But it may be that some individuals who were not directed, not trained by an overseas organisation have of course been inspired by them.  Q. Does the Metropolitan Police need more resources?  I agree with the Prime Minister [Theresa May] when she said that we do need to review across the board how we are tackling terrorism, in terms of our powers, in terms of how we are working with our communities and what is happening in our communities, in terms of the internet, in terms of our equipment, in terms of our computers and so forth.  I am quite confident that we will be reviewing our resources and I am expecting to have conversations with colleagues across the police service about what we think we need to face this changing and emerging threat. And we will of course be talking to government.  I am quite sure that I will be saying that I can lead a police service which in the future can make even further savings as we have all had to do but that we will want more resources to help us and I am sure the same will be being said in the intelligence agencies.  I am not going to put a quantum on it. I think it would be ridiculous to just pluck a figure out of the air or to say I need more of this or that. But obviously we will be reviewing, for example the number of armed officers we have and how they work, and a whole host of other things that is likely, from my point of view, to take more resources and I will be asking for them.

The 1.35 million-acre monument, created by former president Barack Obama at the end of his term and named after its iconic twin buttes, is the first of 27 national monuments that will be evaluated by the Department of the Interior after President Donald Trump ordered the review in April. The deadline for Zinke's recommendation on Bears Ears is June 10, though an Interior Department official did not say when the recommendation would be made public. Related CoverageFactbox: Review of U.S. national monuments could unlock new energy reservesTrump had argued that previous administrations  abused  their right to designate national monuments under the U.S. Antiquities Act of 1906, and put millions of acres of land, mainly in western states, off limits to drilling, mining, logging and ranching without adequate input from locals. Conservation groups, meanwhile, have called Trump's effort to alter existing national monuments illegal and irresponsible, and have vowed to challenge him in court. U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke waits to take the stage with President Donald Trump for his on infrastructure improvements, at the Department of Transportation in Washington, U.S. June 9, 2017.Jonathan Ernst Whatever comes out of these recommendations will give us an insight into how this administration takes its responsibilities to protect public lands and uphold conservation mandates,  said Nada Culver, senior counsel of the Wilderness Society, an environmental advocacy group.     Heated Debate The view from Comb Ridge is pictured in Utah’s Bears Ears area of the Four Corners Region, Utah, U.S. December 18, 2016. Picture taken December 18, 2016.Annie KnoxThe review taps into a heated national debate over Washington's role in America's wildest spaces: environmentalists and tribal groups support federal oversight, but many state political leaders, conservatives, and industry groups say the lands should be generating money for business, creating jobs, or yielding revenue for education and other public services. Bears Ears was created after years of lobbying by a coalition of five tribes, who say the area is sacred. Republicans, like Senator Orin Hatch of Utah, have argued, however, that Obama's designation of the Bears Ears monument had weakened education funding in the state through its School and Institutional Trust Lands system - which delivers revenues from land development to schools. While the land encompassed by the Bears Ears monument is not believed to contain huge amounts of coal, oil or gas, several other monuments on Zinke's review list do - making the Bears Ears decision important symbolically to industry groups.  Who is to say that, in the future, a president couldn’t just put a whole basin under monument designation,  said Kathleen Sgamma, president of the Western Energy Alliance, representing oil and gas companies.

The U.S. chipmaker is part of a consortium led by a Japanese government-backed fund.

The offer by Western Digital, a long-time partner of the laptops-to-nuclear conglomerate's lucrative chips division, comes as uncertainty about the make-up of the groups bidding for Toshiba's crown jewel has increased.

Lesotho, which has been on a political knife-edge since an attempted coup in 2014, held elections last week, the third in five years, after Pakalitha Mosisili, with whom Metsing had been in a coalition government, lost a no-confidence vote as prime minister in March.  Mosisili admitted defeat on Friday to his opponent Thomas Thabane, whose All Basotho Convention (ABC) emerged as the winner of 48 parliamentary seats but short of the 61 needed to form a government.      There is no need for the removal of the existing government in office as we all agree that in order for Lesotho to be stable there is a need for a government of national unity,  Metsing told a news conference late on Friday. Thabane has said his ABC party would form a coalition government with three other parties: Alliance Democrats, Basotho National Party and the Reformed Congress of Lesotho. The outcome reverses the result of an election two years ago, when Mosisili ousted Thabane by teaming up with Metsing and other smaller parties. Lesotho, a nation of two million people, has been hit by several coups since gaining independence from Britain in 1966 and its last two elections failed to produce a winner with a clear majority.  Thabane, who governed from 2012 until 2015, and other opposition leaders, fled the country to South Africa in 2015 after an assassination attempt. Apart from textile exports and regional customs receipts, Lesotho's other big earner is water, piped to South Africa.

Joint work on drones, military transports and combined efforts to stabilize the African Sahel region were projects that could be funded by the new plan, she told the Funke Mediengruppe newspaper chain.  Germany and France want to become the motor of a European defense union and implement the defense fund in a smart way,  von der Leyen said.  The Brexit referendum and the U.S. election opened our eyes. Europeans must take more responsibility for our own security,  she said. Von der Leyen said the finance ministers of both countries were working to develop mechanisms, while the defense ministers were working to identify various projects. Europe-wide training of military officers could also be paid for by the fund, von der Leyen said. Increased cooperation in Africa could help reduce trafficking in arms and people, while helping combat terrorism, she said. The European Commission this week threw its support behind Franco-German plans to integrate Europe's militaries and defense industries. Spurred by Britain's decision to leave the European Union and pressure from the United States, Brussels has seized on deeper military ties proposed last year by France and Germany to show the bloc can still provide security in the face of Islamist militant attacks and a resurgent Russia. German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Saturday underscored the need to rebuild the German military or Bundeswehr after decades of spending cuts, and to increase the attractiveness of military careers in areas such as cybersecurity. Merkel, speaking in a video podcast, said European defense cooperation would be closely coordinated with the NATO alliance, noting that Europe had a keen interest in stabilizing Africa, a source of refugees heading to Europe.  As Europeans, we want a coordinated approach there,  she said. The European Commission this week said it would create a fund with at least 1.5 billion euros a year to enable governments to join forces on development and procurement of new weapons, including drones, cyber warfare systems and other hi-tech gear. The plan must still be approved by EU governments and the European Parliament.  EU leaders will consider an array of proposals on defense cooperation at a summit in Brussels on June 22-23.

Hackers stole $81 million from the Bangladesh central bank in February last year after gaining access to its SWIFT terminal and the emergence of other successful and unsuccessful hacks rocked faith in a system previously seen as totally secure. Despite this, traffic increased on the network last year, hitting an all time peak in June of over 30 million messages. SWIFT's 2016 profit before tax and rebates to its owner-customers fell by 31 percent to 47 million euros ($53 million), following additional investments in security, the co-operative said in its annual report published on Friday. Chairman Yawar Shah said that Belgium-based SWIFT -- the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication -- had linked management goals and incentives to security targets. SWIFT, which was criticized by some former staff and customers for failing to have spotted weaknesses in its customers' operating practices, has expanded its security teams and developed new tools to help clients monitor transactions and spot anomalies.  Its ability to pre-empt attacks was limited by its customers’ historic failure to share information about hacks, SWIFT said. SWIFT is operated as a service to all banks, so cash surpluses are usually distributed to customers via rebates and ever-lower prices, rather than via dividends.  Customers received no rebate for 2016. In 2015 the rebate was 33 million euros. Editing by Alexander Smith","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-banks-swift-cybercrime-idUSKBN1910FX"},

Hackers stole $81 million from the Bangladesh central bank in February last year after gaining access to its SWIFT terminal and the emergence of other successful and unsuccessful hacks rocked faith in a system previously seen as totally secure. Despite this, traffic increased on the network last year, hitting an all time peak in June of over 30 million messages. SWIFT's 2016 profit before tax and rebates to its owner-customers fell by 31 percent to 47 million euros ($53 million), following additional investments in security, the co-operative said in its annual report published on Friday. Chairman Yawar Shah said that Belgium-based SWIFT -- the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication -- had linked management goals and incentives to security targets. SWIFT, which was criticized by some former staff and customers for failing to have spotted weaknesses in its customers' operating practices, has expanded its security teams and developed new tools to help clients monitor transactions and spot anomalies.  Its ability to pre-empt attacks was limited by its customers’ historic failure to share information about hacks, SWIFT said. SWIFT is operated as a service to all banks, so cash surpluses are usually distributed to customers via rebates and ever-lower prices, rather than via dividends.  Customers received no rebate for 2016. In 2015 the rebate was 33 million euros. Editing by Alexander Smith","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/banks-swift-cybercrime-idUSL8N1J708J"},

The Rangers pounded out 13 hits in a 5-2 win to begin the series Friday night, just their fourth victory in the last 15 games. Jonathan Lucroy extended his hitting streak to four games with a home run and two singles while driving in three runs for Texas, which played another game without third baseman Adrian Beltre. The hobbled veteran has missed two straight games with an ankle injury and it appears as if the club wants to give Beltre another day to test the injury before deciding if he needs to be placed on the disabled list. The National League East-leading Nationals committed three errors and left eight runners on base in Friday's loss, falling to 17-10 at home.

He served up three home runs in that start after giving up a total of three over his previous eight appearances. The 26-year-old, who will be pitching in his 100th career game (94th start), has never faced Washington but is 5-5 with a 4.32 ERA in 15 interleague starts. Gonzalez has won back-to-back starts after limiting the Los Angeles Dodgers to two runs on four hits over six innings Monday on the road. The former first-round pick has a 1.69 ERA in six home starts, although he has had to work around 19 walks in 37 1/3 innings. Gonzalez is 4-2 with a 2.55 ERA in 10 career encounters (eight starts) with Texas but he has been hit hard by Beltre (8-for-19, three home runs), Lucroy (8-for-13) and Elvis Andrus (6-for-18).

Even by the Spaniard's ridiculously high standards at a tournament where he has won 78 of his 80 matches since bounding into town like a runaway bull in 2005, the way he has reached a 10th final has been astonishing. The 31-year-old has not conceded a set and dropped only 29 games in six rounds -- two more than Bjorn Borg's 1978 record when he destroyed Guillermo Vilas in the final. Yet standing in the way of the Mallorcan from becoming the first player in the professional era to win the same grand slam title 10 times is a highly-destructive Swiss; not 18-times major winner Roger Federer but the barrel-chested Stan Wawrinka. Wawrinka was at his belligerent best against world number one Andy Murray in a semi-final classic, striking 87 winners in a five-set duel that would have graced any final. Late bloomer Wawrinka, 32, has won each of the three grand slam finals he has contested and possesses the kind of baseline firepower Nadal is yet to face so far in the past fortnight. Described as 'scary' by three-times former grand slam champion Mats Wilander, Wawrinka will not be taking a backwards step when play commences on Court Philippe Chatrier on Sunday when the temperatures are expected to soar into the 80s. Should Wawrinka repeat his scintillating 2015 victory over Novak Djokovic he would become the oldest man to lift La Coupe des Mousquetaires since 34-year-old Andres Gimeno in 1972. The last grand slam clash between the pair came at Melbourne Park in 2014 when Wawrinka beat a hobbling Nadal to claim his first grand slam title. Jun 9, 2017; Paris, France; Stanislas Wawrinka (SUI) reacts during his match against Andy Murray (GBR) on day thirteen of the 2017 French Open tennis tournament at Stade Roland Garros. Mandatory Credit: Susan Mullane-USA TODAY SportsIt was a breakthrough moment for the Swiss, but even then there was a sense he still felt like an imposter at the top table of men's tennis. Three years on and there is little doubt Wawrinka truly believes he belongs alongside the best and that when the stakes are highest, he brings it all to court.  Mentally I've become a different player,  Wawrinka, who has won three of his last six matches against Nadal having lost the first 12, told reporters.  Slideshow (4 Images) When I arrive in a big match, it's like closing, switching off everything in my body except my brain which I put in winning mode.  Rafa's track record on clay is amazing. He's the best player we have ever had. So, of course I can lose but I'm extremely confident about what I do. I know that mentally when I'm there, it's difficult to beat me.  Nadal, who tops the match-wins list this year with a 42-6 record, including a 23-1 stretch on clay, knows the threat. But with La Decima within touching distance and the chance to claim a 15th grand slam title after a three-year hiatus, it will take Wawrinka at his fiery best to stop him.  It's true that when he hits hard, he hits really hard,  Nadal said.  Stopping him can be difficult. I do not want him to play his game, which means I need to make sure I don't let him be in that position where he can hit hard.  I will have to do everything I can to keep him from playing aggressively. If I can play long balls, if I can hit hard, if I can do that, well, I think I will be able to control him.  Whoever wins goes second in the ATP rankings list on Monday -- a three-year high for Nadal and a career high for Wawrinka.

The French state owns a controlling 23 percent stake in the telecom operator and remains kingmaker at the former monopoly. Richard's bid will likely be reviewed by those at the top of France's administration, now under the leadership of President Emmanuel Macron. Richard has led France's biggest telecom operator since 2010 and his current four-year mandate is set to formally expire in May 2018.  He told the board in March that he wanted to apply for a third term,  one of the sources said. Richard will present his case for a new mandate to the board in the autumn and the board is set to make its final decision in February of next year, one of the sources said. He succeeded former CEO Didier Lombard during a tense period at the company between unions and top management, as the group faced a wave of employee suicides in 2008-2009 following an internal reorganisation. Richard is credited with having restored confidence within the group between employees and executives and improving the company's financial results after the arrival in 2012 of Iliad's low-cost brand Free, which has triggered a protracted war in the mobile business. But he failed to reshape the telecoms market in France by cutting the number of telecoms operators from four to three through the acquisition of rival Bouygues Telecom last year. Under his leadership, Orange has notably expanded its telecoms activities overseas in Africa and decided to launch a new online banking service. The group is still looking at ways to better compete with rival Altice by deepening its commercial ties with Vivendi's pay-TV Canal Plus. Separately, Richard may face a trial over allegations of fraud alongside French businessman Bernard Tapie. The Tapie case concerns payments the entrepreneur received in 2008 from the French government while Richard was chief of staff to Christine Lagarde, then France's finance minister.

Trump’s aides are nearing completion of a review of relations with Cuba and are expected to send recommendations to his national security team and then to the president in coming days, a U.S. official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

But they cautioned that a delay in the announcement is still possible if it takes longer for Trump to make a final decision.

Among the options under consideration are banning U.S. companies from doing business with Cuban enterprises tied to the military – which controls a large part of the communist-ruled island’s economy – and tightening rules on Americans traveling there, according to people familiar with the discussions. With the Cuba review approaching its final stages, both sides of the issue have recently stepped up lobbying to sway Trump’s decision. In the letter sent to Trump on Friday, seven of his fellow Republicans warned that rescinding Obama’s policies would “incentivize Cuba to once again become dependent on countries like Russia and China.” Senior officials at the National Security Council met on Friday to begin finalizing a list of recommendations, the sources said. Trump's changes are expected to stop short of breaking diplomatic relations restored two years ago after more than five decades of hostility, administration officials say. But divisions remain within the Trump administration over how far to go, especially given that rapprochement with Cuba has created opportunities for American companies. Internal Debate The National Capitol Building and the Gran Teatro de la Habana Alicia Alonso on the Paseo del Prado boulevard are seen from the rooftop of the Hotel Gran Manzana, in Havana, Cuba June 7, 2017.StringerSome aides have argued that Trump, a former real estate magnate who won the presidency promising to unleash U.S. business and create jobs, would have a hard time defending any moves that close off the Cuban market. But other advisers have contended that it is important to make good on a promise to Cuban-Americans whose support they considered significant winning Florida in the 2016 election. Miami is home to the largest Cuban-American community. The U.S. airline and travel industries have made clear they do not want to see reinstatement of Cuba restrictions.  Imposing new regulations on travel to and trade with Cuba would be bad politics, bad policy, and bad for U.S. business,” said James Williams, president of Engage Cuba, a Washingon-based lobbying group. Vintage cars drive past a renovated Belle Epoque shopping mall, now housing the Gran Hotel Manzana in the top floors and luxury stores on the ground floor, in Havana, Cuba June 7, 2017.StringerBut Trump has come under heavy pressure from Cuban-American lawmakers, including Senator Marco Rubio and Representative Mario Diaz-Balart, to roll back Obama’s rapprochement. Rubio, a member of the Senate foreign relations and intelligence committees, is seen by Trump’s aides as an important figure to cultivate at a time when the members of his administration are under investigation over contacts with Russian officials. Rubio and other Obama critics have argued that he gave away too much to Cuban President Raul Castro for too little in return, especially on human rights. Trump’s aides are considering ways to make future engagement moves contingent on the Cuban government’s improvement on human rights and political freedoms, U.S. officials say. Such an emphasis would contrast sharply with Trump’s approach in other parts of the world where he has insisted the United States would stop lecturing other countries on the issue. “Trump - friend of Putin, Sissi, Salman, Duterte, Erdogan - will cite human rights to justify hurting the Cuban people,” tweeted Ben Rhodes, Obama’s former deputy national security adviser and an architect of his Cuba détente policy. Trump threatened shortly after his election in November to “terminate” Obama’s approach unless Cuba made significant concessions, something it is unlikely to do. Obama implemented his normalization measures through executive actions, and Trump has the power to undo much of it.

Qatari banks have around 60 billion riyals ($16 billion) in funding in the form of customer and interbank deposits from other Gulf states, Chiradeep Ghosh, banking analyst at SICO Bahrain, said. But the United Arab Emirates central bank has ordered local banks to stop dealing with the 59 individuals and 12 entities with alleged links to Qatar and to freeze their assets, state news agency WAM reported late on Friday. It has also told them to apply enhanced due diligence for any accounts they hold with six Qatari banks, including Qatar National Bank (QNB) which is the Middle East and Africa’s largest bank, WAM said in its report The six banks -- QNB, Qatar Islamic Bank, Qatar International Islamic Bank, Barwa Bank IPO-BABK.QA, Masraf Al Rayan and Doha Bank -- did not respond immediately to requests for comment. Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Egypt and Bahrain had earlier branded as terrorists the same individuals, including Muslim Brotherhood spiritual leader Yousef al-Qaradawi, and entities including Qatari-funded charities Qatar Charity and Eid Charity. The move followed the isolation of Qatar by the four states, which have cut all diplomatic and transport links. This pressure is likely to constrain the funding Qatari banks would be able to raise from Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Bahrain, one banker in the region told Reuters.  All Qatari banks will struggle for liquidity and will have to pay a premium for funding from elsewhere outside these four countries,  SICO Bahrain's Ghosh said. Qatari banks, like their Gulf neighbours, have been struggling against a backdrop of lower oil prices, which has pushed up funding costs and raised non-performing loans.  It is especially challenging as they're not very liquid as their loan to deposit ratios are already above 100 percent,  Ghosh said. In recent years several have also expanded outside Qatar’s small domestic market to grow their business, with QNB holding a presence in several countries including Egypt, Turkey, Nigeria and UAE either directly or via affiliates. UAE banks would find it relatively easy to comply with the rules as many had invested in improving their compliance systems in recent years and already complied with sanctions against a range of other entities and individuals, another banker said.

British voters failed to deliver a widely expected parliamentary majority for the Conservative party in Thursday's general election, dealing a major blow to Prime Minister Theresa May just days ahead of difficult Brexit talks with the EU. Speaking during a visit to Mexico City, Merkel said Germany was ready for the Brexit talks, which May said would begin on June 19 as scheduled - although she now risks more opposition to her EU departure plans from inside and outside her party.  I assume that Britain, from what I heard from the Prime Minister today, wants to stick to its negotiating plan,  Merkel told a news conference alongside President Enrique Pena Nieto.

Some parliamentarians in both the Conservative and Labour parties want to remain in the EU. EU leaders expressed concern that May's loss of her majority would raise the risk of negotiations failing, resulting in a legal limbo for people and business. Merkel said Britain was part of Europe regardless of Brexit, and that she wanted the country to remain a good partner.

The incident happened in the afternoon at a site where food aid was being distributed to people displaced by drought earlier this year. Baidoa is about 245 km northwest of Mogadishu.  Two groups of soldiers clashed on the scene where food was being distributed. Five people, mostly women, died in the crossfire and 14 others were wounded. It was an accident and the case is being followed and investigated,  Major Hussein Edin, a police officer told Reuters. Witnesses said the displaced people were caught up in the crossfire as they lined up for food.  Unexpectedly, fighting broke out at the scene of food distribution. I could see many lying after the clash as I ran for my life,  Mohamed Nur, a resident who was at the scene, told Reuters by phone.  Somalia is slowly recovering from drought, potentially reducing the risk that the Horn of Africa nation plunges into famine. The drought had led to some 6.2 million people - about half the country's population - requiring food aid. Families from rural areas moved to cities to search for food as animals died and water sources dried up.

The incident happened in the afternoon at a site where food aid was being distributed to people displaced by drought earlier this year. Baidoa is about 245 km northwest of Mogadishu.  Two groups of soldiers clashed on the scene where food was being distributed. Five people, mostly women, died in the crossfire and 14 others were wounded. It was an accident and the case is being followed and investigated,  Major Hussein Edin, a police officer told Reuters. Witnesses said the displaced people were caught up in the crossfire as they lined up for food.  Unexpectedly, fighting broke out at the scene of food distribution. I could see many lying after the clash as I ran for my life,  Mohamed Nur, a resident who was at the scene, told Reuters by phone.  Somalia is slowly recovering from drought, potentially reducing the risk that the Horn of Africa nation plunges into famine. The drought had led to some 6.2 million people - about half the country's population - requiring food aid. Families from rural areas moved to cities to search for food as animals died and water sources dried up.

The seizure of Marawi by hundreds of fighters who have sworn allegiance to Islamic State, including dozens from neighboring countries and the Middle East, has fueled concern that the ultra-radical group is gaining a foothold in Southeast Asia.  Earlier a U.S. embassy spokesperson in Manila told Reuters  that, at the request of the Philippines government, special operations forces were helping liberate the town, part of which has been occupied by hundreds of militants since May 23.

The assistance comes after months of strain between the two long-time allies that was stoked by Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte's hostility toward Washington and his pledges to throw U.S. troops out of the country. Smoke billowing from a burning building is seen as government troops continue their assault on insurgents from the Maute group, who have taken over large parts of Marawi City.Romeo RanocoWashington deployed special forces soldiers to Mindanao in 2002 to train and advise Philippine units fighting Abu Sayyaf militants in a program that once involved 1,200 Americans. It was discontinued in 2015 but a small presence remained for logistics and technical support. The United States and the Philippines have been allies for decades. Their relationship provided Washington with a strategic foothold in Asia, and offered Manila a shield against China's assertiveness in the region. But Duterte has openly scorned the alliance, seeing it as an  obstacle to a rapprochement with China, and has repeatedly lambasted Washington for treating his country as a lackey.

Turner homered in his first at-bat off the disabled list and the Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the Cincinnati Reds 7-2 on Friday night at Dodger Stadium. Turner, who missed 19 games with a right hamstring strain, went 1-for-3 with two RBIs and was hit by a pitch. Enrique Hernandez also homered for the Dodgers (37-25), who improved to 2-2 on their six-game homestand.  That's a good way come back if I had to draw it up,  said Turner, who has hit safely in his last six games and is batting .524 with a homer and four RBIs during that stretch.  That's the most ideal way to do it.  Joey Votto cranked his 17th home run of the season in the ninth inning for the Reds (29-31), who had their four-game winning streak snapped. Related CoveragePreview: Reds at DodgersCincinnati Reds - PlayerWatchLos Angeles Dodgers - PlayerWatchDodgers left-hander Rich Hill (3-2) limited the Reds to a run and two hits with five strikeouts and three walks in five innings. In his last three starts, Hill is 2-0 with a 2.57 ERA.  Austin (Barnes) did a tremendous job just in between innings after the third inning,  Hill said of his battery mate.  We had a little bit of a lull, but we got back on track in the fourth and fifth innings, and they were very good. You could see the contrast.  Kenta Maeda worked the final four innings for his first major league save. Maeda yielded a run and three hits, fanned five and walked none in his first appearance out of the bullpen. The Reds lost starter Amir Garrett in the second inning. Barnes hit a line drive back to the mound that hit the palm of the pitching hand of Garrett, who was trying to catch the ball over his head. The rookie left-hander went down for several minutes. Garrett attempted several practice pitches but was unable to continue. Reliever Jake Buchanan replaced him. Garrett, who said he was forced to leave because he had no feeling in the hand, was diagnosed with a hand contusion. X-rays were negative, and Garrett said he should be able to make his next start.  I didn't really have time to react (and) I was in an awkward position,  said Garrett (3-5), who gave up two runs, two hits with a walk and a strikeout in one-plus innings.  Hit me in my hand, but X-rays came back and were negative. We're good to go. It's a little tight now, a little bruised, but it's nothing a little ice can't fix.  Reds manager Bryan Price said,  It was a scary moment. I think he was going up to catch the ball with his glove and brought his left hand up as well and the ball ended up hitting in his left hand. Fortunately, it was right in the palm.  Turner drilled a 2-1 Garrett pitch over the left-field wall for a 2-0 Los Angeles edge with one out in the first inning. It was Turner's second home run this season. Jose Peraza's RBI single in the second scored Eugenio Suarez and pulled the Reds within 2-1. But the Dodgers touched Buchanan for two runs in the third and two in the fourth. With the bases loaded, Barnes dribbled an infield run-scoring single that plated Corey Seager. Buchanan made a wild throw to first on the play, allowing Logan Forsythe to score for a 4-1 advantage in the third.  They did a lot of good things,  Price said of the Dodgers.  With Hill, he snapped off some good breaking balls and located some good fastballs. He had a good mix going and the only guy who could figure him out was Peraza.  Then Maeda comes in and all of sudden he looks like he's back on top of his game, he's throwing 92, 94 with a power slider and spot on with his location. We weren't able to do anything until the ninth when Joey hit the homer and we got the two other base hits.

Villar had already left, injured on the play and suffering from back spasms that required X-rays. Despite the injury, which appeared serious as Villar had to be helped onto a cart and taken off the field, the Brewers got an uplifting win over a hot team. Jesus Aguilar and Nick Franklin delivered run-scoring pinch hits for Milwaukee. The hits, part of an offense that produced 14 total on the night, gave the National League Central Division-leading Brewers their third win in four games and third straight over the Diamondbacks, who had won nine straight at home and were a major league-best 24-8 at Chase Field this season. Villar had two hits and an RBI before leaving the game. With Milwaukee up 8-6 in the eighth, he laid out in the hole at second base to snare a hard bouncer from Chris Herrmann, got to his feet and somehow threw out Herrmann at first base for the first out of the inning. Brandon Drury, who led off the inning with a double, had to be held at third base, and the Diamondbacks never scored in the inning. Villar stayed on the ground for some time while being checked by trainers, and had trouble standing, walking to and sitting on the cart. Brewers manager Craig Counsell reported the back spasms. Then he talked about the importance of the play.  It was outstanding. Hopefully it's just kind of one of those things that once it loosens up it gets pretty good,  Counsell said. Related CoveragePreview: Brewers at DiamondbacksMilwaukee Brewers - PlayerWatchArizona Diamondbacks - PlayerWatchOrlando Arcia went 3-for-3 with an RBI, Manny Pina had three hits, two RBIs and scored twice and Hernan Perez hit a solo home run for Milwaukee (33-29). Starter Zach Davies (7-3) earned the win by lasting five innings and allowing three earned runs on four hits with four strikeouts and two walks.  I was proud of myself after that first inning for being able to go after guys and being able to get ahead a little,  Davies said.  Some pitches started working for me there.  Diamondbacks reliever T.J. McFarland (3-1) gave up Aguilar's double in the sixth -- Brett Phillips scored and Arcia came home on an outfield fielding error -- and took the loss. He worked 1 1/3 innings and allowed three earned runs on five hits. Aguilar said he was looking for a high pitch with the infield in. He yanked his big hit into an open area along the left field line.  Unfortunately we couldn't close the gap offensively. They jumped out to that 8-4 lead and I think we ran out of gas,  Diamondbacks manager Torey Lovullo said.  They did a good job offensively. They kept pressuring us, we made some mistakes defensively. ... The Brewers came out and hit the ball well. Unfortunately we couldn't keep pace.  Arcia's sacrifice fly and Franklin's two-out single off reliever Tom Wilhelmsen gave the Brewers an 8-4 lead in the seventh. Those runs were charged to McFarland. The Diamondbacks (37-26) came back with two runs in the bottom of the inning and threatened for more. Gregor Blanco tripled and scored on David Peralta's single, and Brewers reliever Jacob Barnes walked two to load the bases around Chris Owings' sacrifice fly. But Barnes escaped further damage by inducing a weak grounder back to the mound from Nick Ahmed. Jared Hughes, Carlos Torres and Corey Knebel also pitched scoreless relief for the Brewers. Knebel earned a four-out save, his eighth save of the season.  He's putting together quite a remarkable season,  Counsell said of Knebel.  He had to go through the middle of their lineup, too.  Milwaukee scored three runs in the first inning off Arizona starter Randall Delgado, all on a pair of two-out hits. Pina doubled down the left-field line to drive in Domingo Santana and Perez, and Villar blooped a double near the same spot to score Pina. The Diamondbacks got right back into the game with one mighty swing in the bottom of the first. Jake Lamb's home run landed in the patio area that juts out over right-center field, 413 feet from home plate. Lamb has 16 home runs and raised his major league-leading RBI total to 56. Perez put the Brewers in front again 4-3 with his eighth home run, a solo shot with two outs in the top of the fifth.  Everybody's doing a great job right now and that's why we're winning games,  Perez said.  In my mind I was just hoping nothing really bad happened to him (Villar).  Delgado made it through five innings, allowing four runs on seven hits with five strikeouts and two walks. The Diamondbacks took him off the hook for a loss in the bottom of the fifth thanks to a two-out run-scoring single from Paul Goldschmidt, who drove in Peralta after he doubled off Davies. Goldschmidt, who entered the game a .391 career hitter against Milwaukee, has reached base safely in 36 straight home games, one shy of tying Stephen Drew's club record. NOTES: The Brewers played without 3B Travis Shaw, who was placed on the family medical emergency list and is away from the team. Shaw's wife gave birth to the couple's daughter earlier in the week. ... Milwaukee called up OF Brett Phillips from Triple-A Colorado Springs in time for Friday's game, and Phillips started in center field. ... LHP Josh Hader was also brought up from Colorado Springs when the Brewers optioned RHP Paolo Espino back to Triple-A. ... Diamondbacks C-OF Chris Herrmann was able off the bench but not in the lineup for a third straight game because of bruised right hand. ...

RHP Taijuan Walker threw a bullpen session Friday wearing tape over the blister on his right hand.

Chacin pitched a great game,  said Szczur.  I wanted to pick him up.  Szczur led off the bottom of the seventh with a pinch-hit home run off left-handed reliever Matt Strahm (1-3) to break a tie and lead the Padres to a 6-3 win over the Kansas City Royals in an interleague game.  That was pretty cool,  said Szczur.  That picked up him, it picked the team up, it picked me up. I've been grinding lately.  Szczur was hitless in his last 15 at-bats when he drove a 2-and-1 fastball from Strahm 385 feet into the left field stands for his second homer as a Padre. The outfielder was at it again in the ninth, doubling in the middle of a three-run rally against former Padres reliever Chris Young that expanded the lead to 6-2. But nothing comes easy for San Diego these days. The Royals loaded the bases with no one out in the ninth and scored one run on a sacrifice fly before closer Brandon Maurer got Alcides Escobar to ground into a game-ending double play. Related CoveragePreview: Royals at PadresKansas City Royals - PlayerWatchSan Diego Padres - PlayerWatchSzczur's heroics helped the Padres snap a five-game Padres' losing streak and made a winner of right-hander Chacin (5-5). Chacin allowed only three hits and two walks with six strikeouts over seven innings, although one of the hits was a two-run, game-tying homer by catcher Salvador Perez in the fifth. Chacin took a no-hitter into the fifth when Eric Hosmer opened with a single followed by Perez's 12th homer.  My slider was good today,  said Chacin, who further widened his home-road splits.  I could see the slider was working in the first inning. I wanted to go deep into the game tonight. On Perez, I was trying to go in on him and he's a good hitter.  Chacin is 3-1 at Petco Park this season with a 1.58 earned-run average in six starts. He is 2-4 on the road with a 10.27 ERA in seven starts.  It was his really good slider tonight,  said Royals manager Ned Yost of Chacin. The Padres scored single runs in each the first and second but squandered opportunities for more -- and it came back to bite them. Jose Pirela opened the game with single, but was immediately erased on a double play. Wil Myers, Hunter Renfroe and Austin Hedges followed with consecutive sharp singles off left-handed starter Eric Skoglund to give the Padres a 1-0 lead. Cory Spangenberg opened the second with a single, but was picked off first. Erick Aybar and Chacin followed with back-to-back doubles to make it 2-1. After Skoglund walked Pirela and Yangervis Solarte, he was removed from the game in favor of left-handed reliever Scott Alexander, whose second pitch with the bases loaded bounced away from Perez. But the catcher recovered and caught Chacin off third. Myers then struck out. Nine of the 11 Padres facing Skoglund reached base and the seven hits included a pair of doubles. But there was a double play in the four-hit first and two runners were caught off base in the second.  My pitches were in the middle and they were able to square some balls up and that was about it,  said Skoglund.  I wasn't getting ahead and that's the bread-and-butter right there.   They were just on him,  Yost said of Skoglund.  They were just having good swings on him. Mostly it was pitch location. They were kind of diving out on him and getting good pitches to hit.  Chacin allowed only a walk through the first four innings thanks to a couple defensive gems by Aybar at short. But Hosmer grounded a single to right past the dive of second baseman Solarte to open the fifth and Perez drove Chacin's next pitch 394 feet into the second deck in left for the game-tying homer. The Padres were leading 3-2 when they added three runs in the eighth against Young. Aybar singled with two out and advanced to third on Szczur's double to left-center. Pinch-hitter Franchy Cordero followed with a two-run double and scored when Solarte's fly to right fell between Kansas City second baseman Whit Merrifield and right fielder Jorge Bonifacio for a single.  Szczur and Cordero coming through as pinch-hitters was huge for us,  said Padres manager Andy Green. The Royals loaded the bases on three straight singles by Lorenzo Cain, Hosmer and Perez with none out in the ninth, but scored only one run on Mike Moustakas' sacrifice fly just ahead of the game-ending double play. NOTES: The Padres optioned struggling 3B Ryan Schimpf to Triple-A El Paso and recalled RHP Jose Valdez from the Chihuahuas. Schimpf led the Padres with 14 homers but was hitting .158 with a .284 on-base percentage and 70 strikeouts in 165 at-bats. He was hitless in his last 10 at-bats with eight strikeouts. Valdez pitched three scoreless innings in his one appearance with the Padres earlier this season. ...

Making his first appearance in the major leagues since Sept. 29, 2013, the 30-year-old right-hander pitched one inning of relief to get the victory as the Seattle Mariners defeated the Toronto Blue Jays 4-2 on Friday night at Safeco Field. Jarrod Dyson scored one run, drove in what proved to be the winner and made a key defensive play for the Mariners (31-31), who reached .500 for the third time this season. Reliever Nick Vincent struck out the side after allowing a leadoff single in the eighth inning and Edwin Diaz pitched the ninth for his 10th save for Seattle, which has won 10 of its past 12 games. Jose Bautista hit a solo home run for the Blue Jays (29-32), who dropped to 1-3 on their six-game trip. Toronto has scored three runs or fewer in five of its past six games. Cloyd (1-0) pitched for the Philadelphia Phillies in 2012-13, going 4-9 in 19 games, including 17 starts. After spending the 2015 season in Korea, he returned to the United States in 2016 but injured his arm while pitching for the New York Yankees' Triple-A affiliate in Scranton/Wilkes-Barre and underwent Tommy John surgery. Cloyd was pitching in the independent Atlantic League when the Mariners purchased his contract on May 12 and assigned him to Triple-A Tacoma. He was called up June 2 but didn't see any action until Friday, when he relieved starter Sam Gaviglio in the seventh inning. Related CoveragePreview: Blue Jays at MarinersToronto Blue Jays - PlayerWatchSeattle Mariners - PlayerWatch I've been a little antsy,  Cloyd said.  I knew I had to be ready. The ballgame on the line and those guys are good hitters.  Cloyd struck out Ezequiel Carrera to start the inning and got Ryan Goins to ground out to short. With two outs, Kevin Pillar singled down the right-field line. Josh Donaldson then doubled into left center as Dyson made a diving attempt but the ball glanced off his glove. Dyson smothered the ball with his bare hand and got it back in quickly to shortstop Taylor Motter, who made a strong throw to the plate. Catcher Mike Zunino applied the tag on Pillar to end the inning.  Unbelievable play,  Cloyd said.  Dice did a great job knocking it down and Motter threw a strike to Z.  That seemed to spark the Mariners, who took the lead with two runs in the bottom of the seventh. Robinson Cano led off with a double off the center-field wall against Toronto starter Joe Biagini (1-5). After a one-out walk to Kyle Seager, Danny Valencia grounded a run-scoring single into left field to make it 2-2.  Valencia's ball just found a hole,  Blue Jays manager John Gibbons said.  I thought (Biagini) was great, really against one of the top lineups top to bottom you can find in the American League.  A walk to Zunino loaded the bases and Dyson lined an RBI single to center. Valencia was thrown out at the plate trying to score a second run on the hit. Seattle added an insurance run in the eighth on Seager's two-out RBI single off reliever Aaron Loup.  The best thing about this team, there's no hitting the panic button,  Motter said. After getting out of a bases-loaded jam in the first, Gaviglio allowed an unearned in the second. Russell Martin led off with a walk, advanced to second on a passed ball and moved to third when Carrera lined a single off the glove of Valencia at first base. Goins then grounded to first and Valencia stumbled as he attempted to start a double play. Valencia was able to recover and get the out at second, but Martin scored on the play. Gaviglio induced Pillar to ground into an inning-ending double play. With one out in the top of the third, Bautista hit a 413-foot homer down the left-field line to make it 2-0. It was Bautista's 11th home run of the season. The Mariners got a run back in the bottom of the inning as Dyson singled to right field with one out, stole second and moved to third on a wild pitch. Ben Gamel drove Dyson home with a two-out single. Gaviglio went six innings, tying his career high. He allowed two runs (one earned) and six hits. He walked three and struck out five.  Gaviglio was on the edge a little early but kept it in check and gave us a chance to win,  Mariners manager Scott Servais said. NOTES: Mariners DH Nelson Cruz returned to the lineup after missing two games with a right calf injury. He went 0-for-3 with an intentional walk. ...

Kyrie Irving scored a game-high 40 points and LeBron James chipped in with 31 as the defending champions pulled to within 3-1 and forced the best-of-seven series back to Oakland.  We finally settled in, man, it was about damn time, for all of us just to really see what playing well as a group looks like against a great team like the Warriors,  said Irving.  We understand who they have on their team and what they're about and how established they are, but I think that in those three losses we lost track of who we were at the time. We're still a special team as well. We are here for a reason.

Their first-half output beat the previous mark of 79 points set in 1985 by the Boston Celtics. Golden State's usually sharp-shooting offense never found its rhythm and the Cavaliers never took their collective foot off the pedal, leading by as many as 22 points late in the second quarter. Whenever the Warriors looked like they might go on a run and start chipping away at the lead, the home side responded with a rim-rocking dunk from James, a three-pointer from Irving or some tenacious defense.  Our defense was not sharp. They made tough shots, they got it rolling. I thought they played a tremendous game,  said Warriors coach Steve Kerr.  I think the biggest thing, though, was they brought a level of physicality that we did not match. We have to do a better job of that.

Curry, of the best shooters in basketball history, had his worst game of the Finals, scoring a mere 14 points on 4-of-13 shooting.  Just one of those games. Not going to overreact to one,  Curry told reporters.  Obviously I can play better and want to play better and will play better.  Curry will get a chance to atone for his sub-par performance on Monday when the best-of-seven series shifts to Oakland with the Warriors still holding a commanding 3-1 lead.

They did a good job of attacking early and it opened up their three-point game,  said Durant, who had a team-high 35 points.

The Cleveland Cavaliers beat the Warriors 137-116 in Game 4 of the Finals on Friday night to avoid elimination. Kyrie Irving led all scorers with 40 points and LeBron James broke all kinds of records as he posted a triple-double. The loss ended the Warriors' bid for a perfect 16-0 run through the playoffs, which had never been done. Golden State leads 3-1 in the series as it shifts back to Oakland, Calif., for Game 5 on Monday night.  The magnitude of the games, especially the last game, it hit me in a very deep place,  said Irving, who made 15 of 27 shots from the floor and drained seven 3-pointers -- tied for second most in a Finals game.  Glad that we got the monkey off our back in terms of just getting one win in this series in terms of going against this great team.  Golden State whiffed at its chance to pop champagne in Cleveland's visiting locker room for the second time in three seasons -- something the Warriors openly discussed as a goal: celebrating at The Q.  I didn't hear it, but some of the other guys heard it and told me that that they wanted to celebrate on our floor once again and they wanted to spray champagne in our locker rooms, and I think it came from Draymond (Green), which is OK, that's Dray anyway,  James said.  So I just told guys, I didn't stress anything besides just live in the moment. Live in the moment.  The Cavs set Finals records with 86 points in the first half, 49 in the first quarter, and 3-pointers in a game (24). James finished with 31 points, 10 rebounds and 11 assists for his ninth triple-double, passing Magic Johnson for first place in Finals history. Related CoveragePreview: Warriors at CavaliersKevin Love added 23 points for Cleveland and J.R. Smith finished with 15 points. Kevin Durant led the Warriors with 35 points. Green added 16 points and 14 rebounds and Stephen Curry was 4 of 13 for 14 points.  Just one of those games,  Curry said.  Not going to overreact to one.  The Cavs became the first team in NBA history to recover from a 3-1 deficit in the Finals last season. No team has come back from 3-0 in the playoffs.  Believeland is not going to give up and we're going to keep fighting,  Cavs coach Tyronn Lue said.  We're going to keep scrapping.  The Warriors still have ample chances to win their second title in three seasons over the Cavs, something they failed to do last season.  Different team, man, different team,  Curry said.  Obviously, we haven't felt this feeling walking off the court with a loss in a while, but we have done a good job bouncing back and being resilient all year.  The third quarter was easily the most chaotic of the Finals. It started with 6:18 left in the quarter when Green appeared to pick up his second technical. Instead of an automatic ejection, however, Green stayed in the game because officials insisted the first technical given to him -- with 1:55 left in the first quarter -- was actually assessed to Warriors coach Steve Kerr. And with 1:10 left in the quarter, Zaza Pachulia and Kyle Korver were tied up on a loose ball. In the scrum, Pachulia appeared to kick Iman Shumpert -- who was standing over him -- once and punch him twice. Instead of an ejection for Pachulia, however, he and Shumpert were slapped with technicals. The quarter closed with a 3-ball from Curry with 12 seconds to go, answered by one from James with 2.7 seconds remaining. The Cavs led 115-96. Cleveland led 86-68 at halftime and were up by as many as 22. The 86 points were the most in a half in NBA Finals history. A Durant 3-pointer at the buzzer brought the Warriors a little closer. Irving was up to 28 points and James had already registered 22 points, six rebounds and eight assists. The Cavs made 13 3-pointers. The Cavaliers set a Finals record with 49 points in the first quarter and led by 16 when it was over. James had two foul shots with 2.9 seconds left and missed one, otherwise Cleveland would've hung 50 on the Warriors. Four players -- Green, Klay Thompson, Curry and Andre Iguodala -- were whistled for two fouls in the first quarter. The Cavs took 22 free throws in the quarter but only made 14. They were 17-of-26 from the line at halftime.  That was pretty much the factor (the fouls) in that first quarter,  Curry said.  The aggressor usually gets the whistle and they were the aggressor.  NOTES: LeBron James said his mother, Gloria, did not want him to return to Cleveland and play for the Cavaliers in 2014, according to cleveland.com. James made the disclosure in a production for his online platform for athletes, Uninterrupted, in which he, Warriors star F Draymond Green, rapper 2 Chainz, and James' inner circle sat around at a barbershop during All-Star weekend in New Orleans. James said his mom didn't want him to leave the Miami Heat for the Cavs because of the letter Cleveland owner Dan Gilbert wrote to fans the night James bolted for the Heat in 2010. ... James passed Michael Jordan for third place in NBA Finals scoring history with his first basket and for first in free throws in the Finals. Jordan scored 1,176 points and connected on 1,463 free throws in six Finals. ... When the Warriors received 31 points from Kevin Durant and 30 from Klay Thompson in Game 3, it was the first time a team had two players score 30 points in consecutive Finals games since Elgin Baylor and Jerry West did it with the Los Angeles Lakers in Games 6 and 7 of the 1962 Finals.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bkn-warriors-cavaliers-writethru-idUSMTZED6ABDFCCW"},

Germany and Mexico have pursued policies tailored toward exporting manufactured goods, and both ran trade surpluses of more than $60 billion with the United States last year. Many of the biggest names in German manufacturing have factories in both Mexico and the United States, including carmakers such as Volkswagen, BMW and Daimler. However, tension over trade has surfaced under U.S. President Trump and his  America First  policy. Claiming that their gains have come at the expense of U.S. manufacturers, Trump has repeatedly attacked Germany and Mexico over their trade surpluses. And he has vowed to withdraw from NAFTA if he cannot renegotiate it in favor of the United States. Speaking on a visit to Mexico just a few weeks after her foreign minister visited the country and backed its pro-NAFTA stance, Merkel said she was pleased the deal's signatories, the United States, Mexico and Canada, were talking about an update.

Mexico and Germany reject Trump's hostility to NAFTA and say flourishing trade has brought benefits to all. Slideshow (4 Images)Formal talks between the United States, Canada and Mexico to start renegotiating the accord that took effect in 1994 are expected to begin from around mid-August. Merkel also welcomed the fact that sectors like energy could be included in the NAFTA revamp, after Mexico opened up its oil and gas market to private investment at the end of 2013, ending a longstanding state monopoly on production and exploration. Still, unruly parts of Mexico where organized crime holds sway have rattled some investors, and gang violence has recently been on the increase again. Merkel said Mexico faces big challenges from organized crime, adding that Germany was willing and able to help in that fight. She said Europe, like Mexico, was also suffering from problems linked to violence like terrorism. Merkel also said she hoped for a speedy conclusion this year to talks between Mexico and the EU to update a free trade accord.

Maybin played the role of offensive linchpin and Shoemaker capitalized on early run support with a midgame groove as the Los Angeles Angels claimed a 9-4 victory over the Houston Astros on Friday night at Minute Maid Park. Maybin went 3-for-4 with a walk, four runs and a career-high four steals. He was the catalyst for an offense that featured two-hit games from Kole Calhoun, Yunel Escobar, Andrelton Simmons and Martin Maldonado. Calhoun had three RBIs and one of six walks for the Angels (32-32), four by Astros starter Brad Peacock (3-1). Related CoveragePreview: Angels at AstrosLos Angeles Angels - PlayerWatchHouston Astros - PlayerWatch I just really enjoy just creating some havoc out there, putting some pressure on the guys,  Maybin said.  I've always been pretty good at getting bags and tonight they just didn't do a great job of holding me and I got some really good jumps out there. Just trying to put some pressure on those guys, get into scoring position for guys like Kole, A.P. (Albert Pujols), and they did a great job of driving me in tonight.  Again, I've got to be that spark right now. That's what I enjoy doing, getting things started, leading the way, and we've got to keep the momentum.  Shoemaker (6-3), who has won five of six starts, passed his biggest test in the third inning. After surrendering two runs in the second and a leadoff double to Josh Reddick in the third, Shoemaker retired the heart of the Houston order -- Jose Altuve, Carlos Correa and Carlos Beltran -- in succession to ignite a stretch of 13 consecutive outs as the Angels extended their lead from two runs to 8-2.  That was important at the time and it's obviously important for us to keep the lead,  Angels manager Mike Scioscia said.  He was able to get Altuve, Correa and Beltran without that run scoring.  Marwin Gonzalez ended that stretch of dominance with a single one batter before Alex Bregman cranked his seventh home run with one out in the seventh. But it was too little too late for the Astros (43-19), who had their streak of games with at least five runs scored snapped at 12. Peacock labored from the start, issuing three one-out walks after Maybin opened the game with an infield single. Maybin scored when Luis Valbuena drew a bases-loaded walk, the lone run in the first despite Peacock tossing 29 pitches.  They put together some good at-bats and I paid for it, but I just wasn't getting ahead,  Peacock said.  The fastball just didn't feel very good tonight, and they were hitting it and getting on.  It was more of the same for Peacock in the second and third innings. He surrendered a two-run single to Calhoun in the second that scored Danny Espinosa and Maybin. After Escobar stroked a leadoff double in the third, Valbuena brought him home with a single to right field one batter later. After the Houston bullpen struggled with a heavy workload during the recently-completed 10-game road trip, Peacock provided only three innings in his start, allowing four runs, seven hits and four walks on 76 pitches.  It was not our night on the mound,  Astros manager A.J. Hinch said.  It felt like they had someone on base virtually every inning, and they put a lot of pressure on us. We didn't execute the pitches we needed to and they had traffic on the bases all night. There was never really a comfortable inning.

While some investors see bargains in lower valuations of regional banks' shares, few can point with any confidence to near-term catalysts for a turnaround in their fortunes. After outperforming larger banks in the wake of the Nov. 8 U.S. Presidential election, the S&P; 600 index .SPSMCBKS of small cap banks are down 8.1 percent so far this year, data through Thursday showed, while the S&P; 500 index of the biggest U.S. banks .SPXBK is unchanged. The full S&P; 500 .SPX, meanwhile, is up 8.7 percent. Last year, investors bet heavily that smaller, entirely U.S.-focused banks would benefit most from Donald Trump's promises of tax cuts, deregulation and economic stimulus. But those hopes dwindled dramatically as it became clear that President Trump would have difficulty gaining enough support to deliver on any of his pro-growth proposals.  I  would expect (smaller banks) to continue to underperform as long as we don't get some of these policy decisions to move through,  said Stephen Scouten, banking analyst for Sandler O’Neill in Atlanta. Fading hopes for an economic boost from Trump's agenda has compressed the gap between short- and long-term interest rates, putting pressure on bank loan profit margins. This is a bigger issue for regionals which have a greater dependence on lending for their profits than bigger, more diversified banks.  Also, commercial and industrial loan growth has slowed this year after climbing steadily since late 2010. The Federal Reserve's latest Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey, released May 8, showed domestic banks reporting weaker commercial and industrial loan demand from firms of all sizes in the first quarter. Waiting for Clarity   Part of the problem is that companies are waiting for clarity on economic growth prospects and tax rates before making borrowing decisions, according to investors and analysts.         Eventually, for the smaller banks to outperform, concerns about the overall economy need to dissipate. Better economic growth usually leads to better lending growth and in that environment the yield curve steepens as well,  said Brian Kleinhanzl, analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods in New York. Short selling has decreased in most regional and diversified banking sectors so far this year. But short interest in both the SPDR S&P; Bank Exchange Traded Fund (KBE.P) and SPDR S&P; Regional Banking ETF (KRE.P) increased as short sellers may be replacing exposure to individual banks with short bets on the sector.  Short interest in the S&P; bank ETF is up 36 percent for the year while it is up 23 percent in the regional banking ETF. While tax cuts are viewed as one of the biggest boosts for regional banks of all Trump's policy proposals, investors are skeptical it will come any time soon. JPMorgan analysts on Thursday scaled back their forecast on the size of possible U.S. tax cuts and pushed out the timing to the second quarter of 2018 from the third quarter of 2017. White House economic adviser Gary Cohn has said he expects U.S. Congress to get tax reform done this year. But investors say 2018 would likely be the earliest this could happen.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is expected this month to unveil plans for regulating the U.S. banking sector including a relaxation of regulations for community banks, which have struggled with rules imposed after the 2007 to 2009 financial crisis. While investors expect the administration to have trouble  winning congressional support for legislative changes to  regulations such as Dodd-Frank, some are hoping Trump will be able to appoint people to key regulatory positions. If Trump can replace the Federal Reserve's head of banking supervision, this might at least help slow the pace of regulation, said investment managers. Trump is expected to nominate Carnegie Mellon University professor Marvin Goodfriend and former Treasury Department staffer Randal Quarles to fill two of three open seats at the Fed, according to a New York Times report.         If they do get traction and get some of these (policy changes) done, even if they're more watered-down versions of what they had proposed, that's probably very good for sentiment and good for the fundamentals,  said Miles Lewis, portfolio manager for American Century Investments' Small Cap Value fund.

LOUIS -- As Michael Wacha chased Freddy Galvis' potential game-tying hit with two outs and a runner at third in the top of the ninth inning Friday night, the St. Louis Cardinals left fielder thought about one thing.  I have to make this catch because I don't want to go into extra innings,  he said.  We have an early game tomorrow. I don't want us to stay late and come here early.  Pham's diving snag of Galvis' liner capped one of the more tumultuous days in recent franchise history and ended a seven-game losing streak, giving St. Louis a 3-2 decision over the Philadelphia Phillies at Busch Stadium. Hours after executing six personnel changes on the playing roster and coaching staff, the Cardinals (27-32) won for only the sixth time in 23 games. They did so with the one formula that usually ensures success no matter who's on a roster - pitching. Michael Wacha (3-3) won for the first time in seven starts with six solid innings and three relievers each worked a scoreless inning. None of that would have mattered had Pham not used his speed, as well as help from newly-promoted third base coach Mike Shildt. Just before Galvis poked a 1-2 pitch from closer Seung Hwan Oh down the left field line, Shildt, who is also in charge of positioning outfielders, moved Pham closer to the line. Related CoveragePreview: Phillies at CardinalsPhiladelphia Phillies - PlayerWatchSt. Louis Cardinals - PlayerWatchMoments later, Pham made the game-saving play and music played in the St. Louis clubhouse for the first time since June 1, when it last won a game.  It feels good to have the music blaring in here after a win,  Wacha said.  It's been a while.  Wacha did his part to start the postgame concert. After allowing two two-out runs in the third on Tommy Joseph's RBI single and Aaron Altherr's triple off the right field wall, Wacha cruised through the last three innings, allowing just one hit and mowing down seven of the last eight men. He gave up five hits and two runs in his longest outing since May 19, walking two and fanning two.  I felt like I had pretty good command of mostly everything,  Wacha said.  The one inning, I got in trouble with a couple of two-out hits. Overall, my stuff felt really good.  The Cardinals got those runs back in their half of the third off Jeremy Hellickson. Stephen Piscotty's sacrifice fly to the wall in center scored Matt Carpenter and Jedd Gyorko's RBI single up the middle plated Dexter Fowler to tie it. In the fifth, Aledmys Diaz homered for the first time since May 1, belting a bad 1-2 offering over the wall in left-center field. It was his sixth homer of the year and provided the difference. Hellickson (5-4) allowed 10 hits and three runs in six innings, walking one and whiffing five.  Hellickson dodged bullets all night,  Philadelphia manager Pete Mackanin said.  He gave up a lot of hits but beared down when he had to. He pitched well enough to win and he pitched well enough to lose. We just couldn't score.  Given that the St. Louis bullpen had coughed up 11 runs in its previous 8 1/3 innings, Hellickson might have expected to get a win upon his departure. Instead, Matt Bowman struck out the side in the seventh. Trevor Rosenthal pitched around a leadoff hit in the eighth. Oh tightroped through the ninth, overcoming Altherr's bloop double and stranding him at third. It was Oh's 14th save in 16 chances. But if saves were given to fielders for defensive plays, Pham would have definitely logged one.  We have an early game tomorrow. I don't want us to stay late and come here early,  Pham said. NOTES: St. Louis activated 2B Kolten Wong (elbow) from the 10-day DL and designated INF Jhonny Peralta for assignment.

Dansby Swanson hustled an apparent single up the middle into a double with one out in the ninth inning and Ruiz singled to the opposite field on reliever Josh Edgin's first pitch to give the Braves a 3-2 victory over the New York Mets.  I'm not surprised with anything from him,  Ruiz said of Swanson.  He will always take the extra base if he has the opportunity. He saw it and was aggressive and he's usually not wrong. He started that whole thing and put me in position to drive him in.  Swanson, who had smashed a two-run double in the sixth inning, used his speed, instincts and aggressiveness to do in the Mets in the ninth as center fielder Curtis Granderson, who doesn't have a strong arm, was slow getting to the ball.  As we're always saying, 'Just make them stop you.' I kept going and didn't really hesitate,  Swanson said.  I felt that was the right thing to do and it worked out. Any way to get in scoring position.   He is a kid who comes out of the box thinking two,  Braves manager Brian Snitker said of his shortstop.  That's a baseball player. That's why we love that kid the way we do, because he never stops playing the game.  Related CoveragePreview: Mets at BravesNew York Mets - PlayerWatchAtlanta Braves - PlayerWatchGranderson and Travis d'Arnaud hit homers, but the Mets couldn't get a victory for starter Matt Harvey. Braves starter Julio Teheran wasn't rewarded, either. Jim Johnson, who pitched the top of the ninth for the Braves, got the victory to go to 4-1 and Fernando Salas, who gave up the one-out hit by Swanson, took his second loss.  It seems like every day it's something that happens that has kept us from getting going, from an injury or whatever it might be,  Mets manager Terry Collins said.  We can't seem to put it together right now.  Jason Motte gave up the tying homer in the seventh inning by d'Arnaud, who connected on a 1-1 pitch and sent a drive to left field for seventh blast of the season. Teheran, who has an 8-4 career record against the Mets, allowed four hits and a run in six innings, walking three and striking out three before being lifted for a pinch hitter. Harvey was pulled with a 1-0 lead after throwing 102 pitches in five innings in his first scoreless outing of the season and the Braves pounced on reliever Paul Sewald in the sixth. Matt Kemp, who had three hits, led off with a double and Danny Santana was intentionally walked after Sewald threw three balls. Swanson pulled a 3-2 pitch to left field for a double, driving in both runners. Harvey, who gave up six runs each time in consecutive losses to the Braves earlier this season, allowed four hits, walked two and struck out three.  I thought it was a step forward for Matt,  Collins said. Teheran retired the first six batters before Granderson led off the third inning by picking on a 2-0 pitch and smashing his sixth homer over the center-field fence. The blast was the 15th allowed by Teheran, and it gave the Mets at least one homer in 12 straight road games and 23 of their past 25 away from New York. The Braves left six runners on base in the first four innings against Harvey, including the bases loaded in the second.  It's definitely a step in the right direction for where I want to be in terms of keeping runs off the board,  Harvey said.  Obviously ... you'd like to be able to go deeper in the game.

The center fielder is enjoying one of those streaks now.  He's on about a three-week run here where the hard hits have been more frequent, the batting average has been better, the extra-base hits are there,  Boston manager John Farrell said after Bradley ripped a long two-out, two-run homer to cap a three-run eighth-inning rally and lift his team to a 5-3 victory over the Detroit Tigers in the opener of a three-game series Friday night. Bradley, hitting just .231 for the season, drove in a run with a fourth-inning single and then hit his fourth homer in his last 13 games to win it. He drove in his 11th, 12th and 13th RBIs in his last 10 games and has batted .333 over that span. His moonshot capped a night that saw the Red Sox, stymied to the tune of one run in the last two games against the Yankees in New York, rally from three runs down to pull out the win. After Mitch Moreland, who homered and doubled earlier, tied the game with an RBI single, Bradley hit a 1-1 pitch from Alex Wilson (1-3) over the visitors' bullpen in right field for his eighth homer. Related CoveragePreview: Tigers at Red SoxDetroit Tigers - PlayerWatchBoston Red Sox - PlayerWatch That's one of the longer home runs I've seen hit in this ballpark,  said Farrell.  You think ... that's halfway to the red seat (in the bleachers reached by Ted Williams), which almost seems like it's a myth how far the red seat is.  A beautiful swing. Well hit. Timely, no doubt.  Moreland, who has 10 extra-base hits in his last 10 games, made a big stretch to save Pablo Sandoval from an error and end the top of the fourth, led off the bottom with his homer, starting the comeback.  It's important, it's very important,  said Bradley.  We had just lost two on the road so we definitely wanted to start things off right back at home. This was a big win. Hopefully we can get some momentum and keep it going.  Said Wilson:  I just didn't get a ball where it needed to go and he took care of it.  The big inning started when right fielder J.D. Martinez failed to catch up to a Xander Bogaerts pop fly in short right ( we caught a break,  said Farrell) before Bogaerts took second on Wilson's wild pickoff throw. Brian Johnson, summoned from the minors for the third time and third start, struggled through 4 1/3 innings (105 pitches) but kept the Red Sox alive before the bullpen threw 4 2/3 scoreless innings.  That was the key,  said Farrell. Matt Barnes (4-2) pitched the top of the eighth and got the win and Craig Kimbrel worked a perfect ninth for the 18th save of his dominant season. He had two strikeouts, ending the game with Miguel Cabrera's fourth K in five at-bats in the game. The win was the Red Sox' fourth in 29 games when trailing after seven innings. They had scored just three runs in their previous 25 innings before erupting in the eighth. Bradley's homer was his second hit of the game to go with two strikeouts. Asked about the .231 batting average being a bit misleading, Farrell said,  The percentage of hard contact is indicative of a better average. If you're saying he's a .230 hitter, it's one of the harder .230 averages you might see.  The Tigers, who have lost three of their last four, got six solid innings from Jordan Zimmerman, who turned in his second straight quality start. He was hit on the leg by a 111 mph liner off the bat of Bogaerts in the first inning but stayed in, manager Brad Ausmus saying,  It's tough to shake him off the mound. Unless his leg's severed, he's not coming out.  Nicholas Castellanos and Mikey Mahtook homered and Martinez and Jose Iglesias both had three hits for the Tigers (29-31).  We kind of split the game,  said Ausmus.  The first half went to us. The second half went to them. And their second half was better than our first.

Lonnie Chisenhall had an RBI double and Yan Gomes added a two-run single. It was a much-needed win for the Indians, who returned home after losing four of five games on a trip to Kansas City and Colorado.  It's no secret we haven't played the way we want to,  Kluber said.  Maybe we can use tonight as the starting point for us playing better. It's not a bad thing to be reminded that when we play the right way, we get rewarded.  Cleveland took a 1-0 lead in the first inning on an RBI single by Michael Brantley. Kluber sailed through the first two innings but lost it a bit in the third when he gave up four singles and a walk to the first five batters, which the White Sox cashed in for two runs. Adam Engel led off with a single and Kluber struck out Leury Garcia for the first out. Engel then stole second and scored the tying run on a single by Melky Cabrera. Abreu walked and Avisail Garcia followed with a single to center. Cabrera attempted to score from second on the play, but center fielder Bradley Zimmer's throw home was in time to retire Cabrera for the second out.  I got to it quick and tried to get rid of it as quick as I could,  Zimmer said.  Fortunately, I had enough on it to get it there.  Todd Frazier lined a single to center, scoring Abreu and giving Chicago a 2-1 lead. Kluber then righted his ship. He retired Omar Narvaez to end the inning, then struck out the side in order in the fourth inning.  My fastball command wasn't great, but really, they only hit one ball hard. Couple of bloops. Some grounders. I just tried to keep the team in it,  Kluber said. The Indians tied it with a run in the bottom of the fourth. With one out, Encarnacion reached on an infield single. Gonzalez retired Jose Ramirez on a flyout for the second out. But Chisenhall's double off the left field wall moved Encarnacion to third base. Gomes drew a walk to load the bases and Zimmer also walked, forcing in Encarnacion with the tying run.  That was a huge run for us at the time,  Francona said of Zimmer's bases-loaded walk. A sacrifice fly by Abreu in the fifth inning gave the White Sox a 3-2 lead. The Indians took the lead in the bottom of the fifth when Carlos Santana walked and Encarnacion blasted a long home run over the center field wall, his 11th homer of the year, giving Cleveland a 4-3 lead. Ramirez followed with a double and Gonzalez was then removed from the game.  He had a lot of traffic in the one inning, then left a pitch up to Encarnacion (on the home run),  Renteria said of Gonzalez.  He was trying to go away and he missed.  NOTES: The White Sox claimed INF Alen Hanson off waivers from Pittsburgh and activated RHP Jake Petricka from the disabled list. Petricka had been on the DL since April 6 with a strained right lat. Petricka assumed the roster spot created when RHP Brad Goldberg was optioned to Triple-A Charlotte after Thursday's game at Tampa Bay. ...

PETERSBURG, Fla. -- Over the next two months, the Tampa Bay Rays will look to Mallex Smith to replace injured center fielder Kevin Kiermaier. So far, the Rays look to be in pretty good hands. Smith hit a home run, reached base three times and scored three runs as the Rays routed the Oakland Athletics 13-4 on Friday night at Tropicana Field. Tampa Bay (32-31) also had home runs from Steven Souza Jr., Tim Beckham, Logan Morrison and Corey Dickerson while starter Alex Cobb (5-5) gave up one run over six innings.  The team has been playing good,  Smith said.  They are still in the race. The division is very tight so I just wanted to come in here and play my game and stay within myself.  Souza went 3-for-4 with three RBIs and was a double short of a cycle. Jesus Sucre also had three hits and two RBIs. Related CoverageTampa Bay Rays - PlayerWatch We've talked about the bats coming to life and they certainly did,  Rays manager Kevin Cash said.  Everybody seemed to play a pretty big role. We had a lot of good swings. All the guys really contributed.  We can be a pretty dynamic offense with (Smith) performing that way. I know he's not going to hit a home run every night and get on base every time, but just the way he approached his at bats was pretty impressive so that's great to see.  Athletics starter Andrew Triggs (5-6) lost his fourth consecutive start. Stephen Vogt homered for Oakland (26-34) while Khris Davis and Adam Rosales each had RBI hits. The Rays, who hit four home runs Thursday against the Chicago White Sox, continued using the long ball Friday to get to Triggs early and often. Souza gave the Rays a 3-0 lead with a three-run shot in the first inning. Tampa Bay added runs in the second and third innings to make it 5-0. Sucre had an RBI double in the second while Colby Rasmus knocked an RBI single in the third. That was more than enough for Cobb, who threw 96 pitches and struck out five.  I was able to get in a fastball on both sides of the plate,  Cobb said.  I showed that early and then expanded out of the zone a little bit with some off-speed pitches.  Smith, called up from Triple-A Durham on Friday afternoon, hit his first home run of the season -- a two-run blast to right field in the fourth. Morrison made it 8-0 with a solo homer to right later in the inning. Triggs gave up eight runs on nine hits in 3 2/3 innings. He threw 88 pitches, 54 for strikes.  Everything was up (in the zone),  Triggs said.  I could pinpoint only a handful of pitches where I was really happy with the execution. It really needs to be the flip where you can only think of a handful where you really missed. Walking a leadoff guy, two walks, leads to a three-run home run. That can't happen.  Athletics reliever Zach Neal didn't fare any better as the Rays tagged him for five runs in the fifth. Beckham hit a solo shot to straight-away center, his 10th of the season. Dickerson added a three-run homer in the inning while Sucre had his second RBI hit of the game to make it 13-0.  We've had some really bad stretches and this is probably the worst game, at least from the start, we've had this year,  Athletics manager Bob Melvin said.  Our road record is not that great.  NOTES: Rays OF Kevin Kiermaier was placed on the 10-day disabled list with a right hip fracture.

The Yankees are also benefitting from a run of solid starting pitching after the best outing of Jordan Montgomery's brief career. Hicks homered twice and Montgomery pitched a career-high seven innings as New York pulled away for an 8-2 victory over the Baltimore Orioles on Friday night. Hicks was batting .205 with two homers and 12 RBIs through New York's first 58 games last year after joining the team in a trade from the Minnesota Twins. After connecting off Dylan Bundy and Edwin Jackson in his third career multi-homer game, Hicks is up to .318 with 10 homers and a career-high 34 RBIs while getting touted by general manager Brian Cashman as a possible All-Star.  It feels really good to be able get off to a hot start and I want to keep it going,  Hicks said.  Especially since last season I got myself in a hole and this year I've started out hot, so it feels good.  Yankees manager Joe Girardi added:  He continues to shine and he's been really helpful.  Related CoveragePreview: Orioles at YankeesBaltimore Orioles - PlayerWatchNew York Yankees - PlayerWatchHicks, who is handling center field duties while Jacoby Ellsbury recovers from a concussion, hit the tiebreaking homer to lead off the sixth. He gave the Yankees a 3-2 lead by sending a 2-1 pitch approximately 406 feet into the section that was created on May 22 in anticipation of homers by Aaron Judge.  That's cool. I got a kick out of it,  Hicks said before laughing when a reporter told him  at least it was a guy named Aaron . Hicks turned in his second multi-homer game of the season. It was the 10th by a Yankee this season, matching their entire total from last season. Montgomery (4-4) won his second straight start after laboring through 4 1/3 innings at Baltimore on May 29. He retired 17 of the final 18 hitters, set a career high with eight strikeouts and threw 94 pitches.  We're giving him smaller bits and pieces, it's kind of what you do with young players,  Girardi said.  We want to see him clear hurdles and he continues to clear them and we really like what he's doing.  Montgomery allowed a two-run homer to Jonathan Schoop in the second inning but little else. In the first time through the lineup, the Orioles were 4-for-8 with a walk and the rest of his outing they were 1-for-17. It also continued a run of strong starting pitching after Masahiro Tanaka allowed three homers Tuesday. Since then, the Yankees have allowed three runs in the last 29 inning,s and since May 31, opponents are 0-for-42 with runners in scoring position. Besides the big night by Hicks and Montgomery's longest outing, others contributed as the Yankees (35-23) tied a season high by going 12 games over .500 for the second time. Starlin Castro hit a solo homer and Chase Headley lifted a sacrifice fly to the warning track in right in the second. After Hicks hit his ninth and 10th homers, Matt Holliday added an RBI double and Austin Romine drove in the final two runs with a base hit. Bundy (6-5) opposed Montgomery for the second time in three starts and allowed three runs and six hits in six innings. He lost for the fourth time in his last five starts despite allowing three earned runs or less for the 12th time.  It's a tough lineup over there, obviously, so you've just got to make quality pitches from the get-go,  Bundy said.  And I didn't really do that in the second inning, or in the sixth, against Hicks.  The Orioles lost for the 12th time in their last 18 games and did not get a hit after Ruben Tejada's second hit of the game. They were 0-for-6 with runners in scoring position and in the biggest at-bat of the game, Adam Jones struck out with Tejada at third for the final out of the fifth when the game was still tied.  I'm always going to give some credit to their pitcher,  Baltimore manager Buck Showalter said.  The young man's having a good year and throwing the ball well. We're just not making many adjustments to pitching patterns that we know are there.

He took aim at the batter's eye in center field at PNC Park and tried to hit a ball over it. He couldn't do it then --  I couldn't get the right pitch,  he said -- but he nearly did later in the evening. Stanton hit a 449-foot homer in the third inning that bounced off the camera platform on top of the batter's eye and back onto the field. It was one of 18 hits the Marlins pounded out Friday night in a 12-7 win over the Pittsburgh Pirates.  Didn't get out of the stadium, man. Hopped back in,  Stanton said with a laugh. He was 2-for-4 with three RBIs. Miami (27-33) got two homers from Tyler Moore, who had four RBIs, and improved to 11-4 in its past 15 games. The Marlins won the first two games of a four-game weekend series by a combined 19-8.  Just a lot of good things offensively tonight,  Miami manager Don Mattingly said.  Everybody making a contribution.  Pittsburgh (26-35) lost its fourth straight to drop to a season-low nine games below .500. Related CoveragePreview: Marlins at PiratesMiami Marlins - PlayerWatchPittsburgh Pirates - PlayerWatchThe Pirates, who had 13 hits, clawed back from a five-run deficit to come within 7-4. Miami, however, tacked on three more in the sixth, Moore's second homer in the seventh and another run in the eighth for a 12-4 lead. That rendered Pittsburgh's single run in the eighth and another two in the ninth relatively meaningless.  We needed a big hit to stay in the boat race because they kept adding on multiple-run innings,  Pirates manager Clint Hurdle said.  It's hard to keep up. We had a chance. We would have had to be really, really effective on offense to continue to run with them.  Pittsburgh right-hander Tyler Glasnow's struggles continued. Glasnow (2-6) gave up seven runs (six earned) and 10 hits in four innings with one strikeout and no walks before he was lifted for a pinch-hitter. Two of the hits were homers.  I just think I'm leaving it in the (strike) zone too much,  Glasnow said.  I guess the difference is I would much rather not walk guys and be in the strike zone. But my two-seam was coming back into the middle. To lefties, it's not really getting in there. To righties, the same.  Miami starter Vance Worley, a former Pirate, wasn't a ton better. He gave up four runs and six hits in 3 2/3 innings with two strikeouts and no walks. Dustin McGowan (4-0) followed Worley with 1 1/3 hitless, scoreless innings for the win. Pittsburgh took a short-lived 1-0 lead in the first when David Freese doubled and scored on Josh Harrison's double. Miami took a 2-1 lead in the second on Moore's sacrifice fly RBI and Worley's RBI infield single. Stanton led off the Marlins' third with his 16th homer, the one that nearly cleared the batter's eye, for a 3-1 lead.  He's a strong guy,  Pittsburgh catcher Jacob Stallings said.  He likes it out over the plate, for sure. Maybe he was sitting on it. That was a pretty impressive piece of hitting.  With two outs that inning, Moore hit a two-run shot to left to make it 5-1. Freese's bloop RBI single in the third brought the Pirates within 5-2, but Stanton picked up a groundout RBI in the fourth for a 6-2 Miami edge, and Dee Gordon scored right after when he stole third and scored on catcher Jacob Stallings' throwing error to make it 7-2. The Pirates scored twice in the fourth to cut it to 7-4. Adam Frazier drove in one with a groundout and Jose Osuna scored on a wild pitch. Even with some late runs, Pittsburgh never got closer.  The guys kept basically swinging the bats all night,  Mattingly said.  It's one of the things you like. They were coming. They score early and they kept scoring.  Felt like it was going to be one of those games we were going to have to go out and keep trying to put runs on the board and not be satisfied with the number of runs we were getting.  NOTES: Pittsburgh LHP Tony Watson was moved out of the closer role, manager Clint Hurdle announced before the game. LHP Felipe Rivero and RHP Juan Nicasio will share ninth-inning duties. Watson still pitched a perfect ninth but in a mop-up role. ... IF Alen Hanson was claimed from Pittsburgh off waivers by the Chicago White Sox. ... Miami C A.J. Ellis started for C J.T. Realmuto. ...
