Martinez in a trade with the Detroit Tigers, the slumping Arizona Diamondbacks produced one of their biggest offensive outputs of the season. Chris Hermann and Rey Fuentes homered, and the Diamondbacks tied a season high with nine extra-base hits in an 11-2 victory over the Cincinnati Reds in the opener of a three-game series on Tuesday at Great American Ball Park.  It's the game we've been waiting for, for a while,  said manager Torey Lovullo.  The guys have really been staying with the process and believing in each other. They've been grinding every day, maybe trying too hard to be the guy to make things happen.  David Peralta was among a franchise-record nine D-backs batters to register an extra-base hit, going 3-for-5 with a double and RBI, helping Arizona (54-39) snap a season-high, five-game losing streak. The D-backs set a franchise record with six extra-base hits in the fifth inning. Fuentes' three-run homer in the seventh inning off Lisalverto Bonilla was his first career pinch-hit home run and only his second homer of the season.  It felt really familiar,  Fuentes said of the D-backs' offensive outburst.  That's what we've been doing all year. It was nice to hear our bats make a lot of noise.  Related CoveragePreview: Diamondbacks at RedsArizona Diamondbacks - PlayerWatchCincinnati Reds - PlayerWatchDiamondbacks left-hander Robbie Ray (9-4) made his first appearance in 11 days and allowed two runs on four hits in six innings. he retired seven of the final eight batters he faced. Ray recorded his 500th career strikeout in the fourth inning and finished with four on the night against three walks.  Felt good to get back out there, everything felt good,  Ray said.  Able to go out and get six solid innings. And, the team got the win, which is good. We're very capable of putting up big numbers on the scoreboard. It was just a matter of time.  Martinez, who hit .305 with 16 homers and 39 RBIs this season for Detroit, was acquired for three minor league infielders. Most of the Arizona players learned of the trade prior to the Tuesday night game. The excitement was palpable.  My wife texted me that we got J.D.,  said Ray, who played with Martinez for one season in Detroit.  He'll make us that much better. He's got his approach for every pitcher. He uses the whole field.  Another oft-rumored trading chip, Cincinnati shortstop Zack Cozart, homered and had three hits on Tuesday for the Reds (39-54), who have dropped five straight since the All-Star break by a combined 46-14.  From a position-players standpoint, those guys go out and bust their tails,  Reds manager Bryan Price said.  It's hard to dig yourself out. We've had a lot of losing streaks. We've had a lot of turnover in both the rotation and the bullpen. The one theme has been trying to rebuild a pitching staff.  Right-hander Sal Romano (1-2) was recalled from Triple-A to start the game for Cincinnati, and he allowed six runs and five walks in four-plus innings. Cozart's solo home run, his first long ball since June 4, put Cincinnati ahead 1-0 in the first. It was his 10th homer of the season, and it snapped an 0-for-11 skid.  It was a fastball in,  Ray said.  I was pitching a few pitches here and there. Didn't hurt me too bad.  The Diamondbacks tied the game when Chris Owings doubled and scored on Daniel Descalso's sacrifice fly in the second and took a 2-1 lead on Paul Goldschmidt's RBI double in the third. Goldschmidt walked in his other four plate appearances. The Diamondbacks managed only two runs on three hits through four innings against Romano. However, with the score tied 2-2 in the fifth, Arizona erupted for four doubles, a triple and a home run to take control. The big blow was Jake Lamb's two-run triple down the right field line, putting the Diamondbacks ahead 5-2. Lamb scored on Brandon Drury's double to make it 6-2. Herrmann then launched his eighth home run of the season, a two-run shot, to give Arizona a six-run advantage.  As a team, we're really excited and pumped for tomorrow,  Fuentes said.  We had a tough stretch, not much was going our way. Every team goes through that. I'm glad we came out of it today.  NOTES: Arizona dealt INF Dawel Lugo, INF Sergio Alcantara and INF Jose King to the Detroit Tigers in the deal that netted OF J.D. Martinez. ... The Reds placed RHP Scott Feldman on the 10-day disabled list with right knee inflammation, recalled RHP Sal Romano and RHP Lisalverto Bonilla from Triple-A Louisville and optioned OF Jesse Winker to Triple-A. ... Romano is one of seven rookie pitchers to start a game this season for Cincinnati.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-diamondbacks-reds-writethru-idUSMTZED7JBGNNDH"},

Xi said on Saturday that a new Financial Stability and Development Committee will be set up under the State Council, or cabinet, and that the People's Bank of China (PBOC) will take on a bigger role in managing risks in the financial market. No indication has emerged on who could head the committee.  After Xi's statement, regulators and policymakers pledged to improve the way they coordinate supervision for what officials call a  chaotic  financial market. China is grappling with rising risks from misallocated investment that has built up since the global financial crisis.  PBOC said on Tuesday that it would  carry out the office duties  of the new body, indicating the committee's day-to-day operations might be conducted from the central bank. An unnamed PBOC official quoted by Xinhua on Tuesday said the committee's office will be based at the central bank.  The new body's responsibilities include formulating plans for the development of the financial sector, ensuring regulatory cohesion, formulating rules and regulations to fill in regulatory gaps, and holding regulators accountable when supervision is lacking, Xinhua quoted the official as saying.  A researcher at a government think tank, who insisted on anonymity, said it made sense for the PBOC to host the office as  the central bank had the capacity and resources to do the work. Those resources include PBOC's own financial stability department. The department head, Lu Lei, told the official People's Daily in an interview the new committee will help to coordinate financial reform and regulation of markets. Lu, who was recently appointed deputy head of the foreign exchange regulator, described China's markets as  full of chaos  and lax supervision. He also said the new body's scope of influence could extend to monetary, fiscal and industrial policy. Support Is Pledged China's banking regulator on Monday vowed to  resolutely follow  the leadership of the new financial stability committee and to work closely with the PBOC and other regulators. The insurance regulator said it supported Xi's focus on fighting financial risks and deepening reform, while the securities regulator said it would follow the lead of a new financial oversight body.  With the government pledging anew to contain financial risks, speculative Chinese stocks on Monday fell, as investors interpreted that to mean tighter regulation.  Analysts also interpreted creation of the committee and Xi's comments on the importance of financial security and deleveraging to mean further monetary tightening and stronger risk controls.    Financial regulatory tightening will likely go deeper and stay longer than many previously expected,  economists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch said in a note Monday.  As is usually the case with a new campaign to step up reform, some voices have emerged calling for prudence in implementing changes.   Financial market development should learn from foreign experience, but must be based on national conditions... and cannot be too hasty,  the People's Daily said in a commentary Tuesday.

China Central Television (CCTV) mentioned Suning's 2016 purchase of a 70 percent stake in Italian soccer club Inter Milan for 270 million euros ($311.61 million)  as an example  of a deal that potentially raised concerns.  This famous club has been loss-making for five years, with total losses of 275.9 million euros,  the CCTV narrator said during the 25-minute show aired on Tuesday night.  What is the purpose of acquisitions like this?  Beijing is on a drive to control risks in its financial system, including firms taking on excessive levels of debt to fund overseas deals. Chinese authorities clamped down on capital outflows and overseas acquisitions last year. The curbs have drawn in other major Chinese firms including property developer Dalian Wanda Group, Anbang Insurance Group , Fosun International Ltd and HNA Group. Chinese regulators have told banks to stop providing funding for several of Dalian Wanda overseas purchases, sources familiar with the matter said on Monday. Suning, China's biggest electronics retailer which is making a big push into sports and media rights, has not yet been publicly targeted by regulators. A Suning spokesman did not respond to requests for comment. However, another person at the company, who did not want to be named, said it was  purely coincidence  that CCTV was discussing the deal at this time because of the recent focus on outbound investment. Suning shares fell 6.5 percent to a near 7-week low of 10.22 yuan  ($1.51), before recovering slightly to trade at 10.55 yuan by 0344 GMT. Chinese authorities reiterated earlier on Tuesday that they would look to curb  irrational  overseas investments, a drive started last year which has zeroed in on deals in real estate, entertainment and sport. The CCTV show involved an interview with a researcher at the state-backed Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. It also mentioned a separate Chinese deal for rival Italian soccer club AC Milan last year and property developer Sunac.

Rowsley, whose businesses are mainly in design and engineering, real estate development and hospitality, will diversify into healthcare through the proposed all-stock deal.  Healthcare is a big and growing market due to aging demographics, longer lifespan, major trends to increase birth rates, and growing affluence,  Ng Ser Miang, Rowsley's chairman, said in a statement late on Tuesday. Rowsley has signed a non-binding term sheet to buy 100 percent of Singapore hospital operator Thomson Medical Pte Ltd and a 70.36 percent stake in Malaysia's TMC Life Sciences Berhad from Lim. It expects to complete a sales and purchase agreement within two months. Billionaire Lim, the owner of Spanish football club Valencia, has a 45.34 percent stake in Rowsley. Lim has a fortune worth $2.1 billion, according to Forbes magazine. The company will issue new shares at S$0.075 apiece to Lim for the deal. Rowsley is planning a bonus issue of free warrants for its existing shareholders after completing the deal.  It gives Rowsley a new direction.

Fitch has also assigned an expected long-term rating of 'A+(EXP)' to the senior unsecured US dollar notes to be issued by CDBL Funding 2 under the programme. Under the programme, CDB Leasing can either issue MTNs directly or through CDBL Funding 2, an offshore special purpose vehicle (SPV) established by Metro Excel Limited (MXL). The proposed notes to be issued by CDBL Funding 2 will be supported by a guarantee from MXL and benefit from a keepwell and asset purchase deed undertaking provided by CDB Leasing. MXL is the primary overseas platform for CDB Leasing's non-aircraft leasing business. MXL was established in 2014 and is wholly owned by CDB Leasing through CFAS Service Limited. The ultimate parent of both MXL and CDB Leasing is China Development Bank Corporation (CDB, A+/Stable). The programme and the proposed notes will be listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and the proceeds will be used for CDB Leasing group's working capital and for general corporate purposes. The maturity structure will be finalised upon settlement. The final rating is contingent upon the receipt of final documents conforming to the information already received. KEY RATING DRIVERS The ratings on the MTN programme and the proposed notes issued under the programme primarily reflect our assessment of CDB Leasing's credit profile and an extremely high probability of support from CDB Leasing to MXL and CDBL Funding 2. The programme's ratings reflect the ratings that are expected to be assigned to senior notes issued under the programme. The ratings are in line with CDB Leasing's Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of 'A+'. The ratings of CDB Leasing reflect our view of an extremely high level of support from CDB, given CDB Leasing's role as CDB's core subsidiary as well as its strategic importance and close linkage to the bank. In Fitch's opinion, a default by CDB Leasing would create enormous reputational risk for CDB. CDB Leasing's IDR was first assigned on 10 July 2014 and subsequently affirmed on 23 February 2017. For further information, refer to <a href= https://www.fitchratings.com/site/pr/1019408 >Fitch Affirms the Ratings of Chinese Banks' Leasing Subsidiaries, dated 23 February 2017. MXL, which is domiciled in Hong Kong, is a wholly owned subsidiary of CDB Leasing. MXL is highly integrated with CDB Leasing and we expect it to receive an extremely high level of support from its parent, which makes and arranges all of MXL's operational and funding decisions. In our opinion, a default by MXL would create enormous reputational risk for CDB Leasing and its ultimate parent, CDB, given that counterparties generally see MXL as an integral part of CDB Leasing and the funding is mostly backed by CDB Leasing's credit. The expected rating of 'A+(EXP)' on the proposed notes issued by CDBL Funding 2 are underpinned by our expectation of an extremely high level of support from CDB Leasing and MXL, with the benefit of a guarantee from MXL and the keepwell structure and asset repurchase agreement provided by CDB Leasing. The guaranteed notes will represent MXL's direct, unconditional, unsubordinated and unsecured obligations and rank at least pari passu with all its other current and future direct, unsecured, unguaranteed and unsubordinated debt. The keepwell and asset purchase deed commits CDB Leasing to ensure CDBL Funding 2 and MXL have sufficient liquidity to meet their obligation under the guaranteed notes and remain solvent and a going concern at all times. Under the deed of asset purchase, CDB Leasing is required to repurchase assets held by MXL upon the occurrence of a triggering event for MXL to meet any outstanding debt obligations under the guaranteed notes. The triggering event refers to the situation in which MXL does not have sufficient liquidity to meet its payment obligations or an event of default. The deed of asset purchase serves as an important mechanism to allow CDB Leasing to provide foreign-currency liquidity to MXL in a timely manner. CDB Leasing does not require approval from the State Administration of Foreign Exchange for these foreign-currency transactions because buying assets for leasing purposes is a part of CDB Leasing's operating activities sanctioned by the relevant authorities, including the China Banking Regulatory Commission. There could be practical difficulties enforcing the keepwell and asset purchase deed, which is not as strong as a guarantee. Nevertheless, the deed demonstrates a strong propensity for CDB Leasing to support MXL, if required. RATING SENSITIVITIES The rating on CDB Leasing's MTN programme are directly linked to CDB Leasing's IDR and move in tandem with any changes in CDB Leasing's ratings. CDB Leasing's rating may be downgraded if there are signs of a declining probability of support from CDB, including significant change in the ownership structure and effective control. Any change in CDB's rating, which reflects shifts in the perceived willingness or ability of China's sovereign (A+/Stable) to support CDB and its subsidiaries in a full and timely manner, is also likely to affect the ratings on CDB Leasing to the same magnitude. The rating on CDBL Funding 2's guaranteed notes is directly correlated with significant changes in CDB Leasing's and CDB's willingness or ability to support MXL if required. Any significant changes in the perceived willingness or ability of China's sovereign to support CDB and CDB Leasing in a full and timely manner is also likely to affect the rating on the guaranteed notes to the same magnitude.

In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch’s factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors.

Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts.

The IPA Bellwether report showed that over 28 percent of its survey panel recorded an upward revision to their 2017/2018 marketing budgets during the second quarter, compared with around 15 percent that recorded a fall. The survey, conducted by IHS Markit on behalf of the Institute of Practitioners in Advertising, said on balance a net 13.1 percent of UK companies indicated they would increase their 2017/2018 marketing budgets in the second quarter, higher than the 11.8 percent in the first quarter. Around 300 UK marketing professionals, primarily from Britain's top 1,000 companies and across all key business sectors, were interviewed for the survey. Growth in ad spending is expected to be a marginal 0.6 percent in 2017 and expected to stagnate in 2018, hurt by  underwhelming  performance in business investment and softness in consumer confidence, the survey showed. British inflation unexpectedly slowed last month for the first time since October, but Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said on Tuesday that the  big picture  for inflation remained the same.  The election result has thrown further uncertainty into an already volatile environment. It is inevitable that this has had a knock-on effect on UK plc,  IPA's director general Paul Bainsfair said. The increased marketing spend was broadly concentrated in the digital space during the second quarter, with the latest survey showing that internet budgets were raised to the greatest degree in just under a decade, according to the report.

Simpson stands a good chance of winning release from prison in October when he appears before Nevada's parole board this week, legal experts said, after serving nine years for a botched attempt to steal mementos from his sports career at gunpoint. However, one factor that could weigh against his seemingly solid case for parole is the notoriety still surrounding Simpson's acquittal in a sensational double-murder trial that gripped America two decades ago, according to some who have followed his case most closely.  What plays against him is the ghost of the murders,  Loyola Law School professor Laurie Levenson told Reuters on Tuesday. Anyone else fitting Simpson's inmate profile would be virtually assured of parole, she said.  What we don't know is how much the O.J. factor will make a difference,  Levenson said. The four parole commissioners meeting on Thursday in Carson City are supposed to decide Simpson's fate on the basis of other factors, including his age, his conduct in prison and whether his release would pose a threat to public safety. Judged by such standards, inmate No. 1027820 at the Lovelock Correctional Center would by all accounts be well-suited for parole, clearing the way for him to walk free once he has finished serving the minimum term of his sentence on Oct. 1. Besides having already won a favorable parole ruling from the same commissioners four years ago before reaching eligibility for release, the 70-year-old former football star also lacks any prior felony convictions and is reported to have been a model inmate. Simpson was instrumental in mediating inmate disputes at Lovelock, served as an unofficial  athletic director  in the prison yard, led prayer groups and even lobbied for inmate education funding, said Nevada state Assemblyman Osvaldo Fumo, who was part of Simpson's legal team in a failed appeal of his conviction.  Forgiveness  Simpson will appear before the parole board by live video feed from prison. He will be joined there by a lawyer and  supporters including daughter Arnelle Simpson, sister Shirley Baker and one of his robbery victims, who  plans to express his forgiveness  of Simpson at the hearing, Fumo said. David Roger, the retired Clark County district attorney who tried Simpson in 2008, said:  Based upon my knowledge of his background and behavior in prison, I expect he will be a very good candidate for getting parole.  In a similar assessment posted last week on the internet forum Reddit, incumbent D.A. Steve Wolfson said:  Most people who are ... 70 years old, who have been model prisoners, will be excellent candidates for parole. Mr. Simpson fits that description.  Wolfson said his wife, retired Judge Jackie Glass, presided over Simpson's Las Vegas trial, sentencing him to a term of nine to 33 years in prison. A jury found Simpson guilty of all 12 charges against him for storming into a Las Vegas hotel room in 2007 with four cohorts and holding two sports memorabilia dealers at gunpoint, then making off with thousands of dollars in items he said rightfully belonged to him. His conviction came exactly 13 years after his 1995 Los Angeles acquittal in the murder of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Ron Goldman, who were found stabbed and slashed to death in June 1994. A civil court jury later found Simpson liable for the deaths and awarded $33.5 million in damages to the victims' families, a judgment renewed in court for another decade and enlarged to about $58 million two years ago. It remains largely unpaid. Prosecutors said the Las Vegas robbery grew out of grudges Simpson had nursed since his murder trial and civil case. David Cook, long-time attorney for Goldman's father, Fred Goldman, called his client  the elephant in the room  as Simpson's fate is decided. He vowed to remain dogged in seeking to collect on the judgment against Simpson.  The good news for Mr. Simpson is he's probably going to get out on Oct. 1,  Cook said.

Franco's home run overshadowed another shot by Giancarlo Stanton as the Philadelphia Phillies defeated the Miami Marlins 5-2 on Tuesday night at Marlins Park.  He had a different approach in batting practice, and it was obvious,  Phillies manager Pete Mackanin said of Franco, who has seven game-winning RBIs this year.  He really concentrated on staying above the ball and leveling off his swing.  Franco's solo blast to left-center field broke a 2-2 tie in the eighth inning. It was his 14th homer of the season and his fourth this month. His past three homers have broken deadlocks. Marlins reliever Dustin McGowan (5-1), who gave up the homer to Franco, took the loss. All-Star reliever Pat Neshek (3-2) earned the win for the Phillies (31-61), who have the worst record in the majors. Of Neshek's 41 appearances this season, 39 have been scoreless. Hector Neris tossed a perfect ninth inning for his ninth save. Related CoveragePreview: Phillies at MarlinsPhiladelphia Phillies - PlayerWatchMiami Marlins - PlayerWatchMiami (42-50) was powered by Stanton, who leads the National League with 29 home runs in just 92 games, the fastest homer pace in franchise history. His homer in the first inning might have been a two-run shot had it not been for a prior call that was overturned. Dee Gordon, batting one spot ahead of Stanton, initially beat out an infield single, but the ruling was changed upon video review.  I don't think it turned any true momentum in the game,  Marlins manager Don Mattingly said.  We got momentum right away with (Stanton's) homer.  Neither starter earned a decision. Marlins left-hander Adam Conley allowed two runs in six innings in his first start since returning from Triple-A New Orleans.  It was a step in the right direction,  Conley said.  I think the urgency to do my job was there all night.  Phillies right-hander Vince Velasquez allowed two runs, one earned, in six innings in his first start since he was placed on the disabled list on May 30 due to an elbow injury.  I feel good from the get-go, pitching to contact,  Velasquez said.  I just tried to pick up where I left off (before the injury).  For the second game in a row, Stanton provided the first score with a homer. This time it was a solo blast to left that was measured at 442 feet, with an exit velocity of 111 mph. The Phillies evened the score in the second on an RBI single by Cameron Perkins. Philadelphia might have scored more, but Franco was thrown out at home on the front end of an unusual double play. Miami took a 2-1 lead in the third. Velasquez barehanded a swinging bunt by JT Riddle but threw wildly past first baseman Tommy Joseph. Riddle wound up at third on a two-base error. On the next pitch, catcher Cameron Rupp failed to backhand a low throw, and Riddle scored on the passed ball. Philadelphia tied the score 2-2 in the fourth. Odubel Herrera walked on a 3-2 pitch, advanced to second base on a wild pitch and to third on a single to left by Rupp. Herrera scored on Perkins' bunt single between the mound and first base. Phillies rookie Nick Williams hit a two-run homer in the ninth inning to provide the final margin. As it turned out, that was too much for the Marlins to overcome.  This was a game,  Mattingly said,  where we shut down offensively.  NOTES: Marlins OF Ichiro Suzuki had a pinch-hit single in the eighth. It was career hit No. 3,056, which moved him into 23rd place on the all-time list, ahead of Rickey Henderson. ... Marlins RHP Dan Straily (hand) will make his scheduled start in Wednesday's series finale against the Phillies and RHP Nick Pivetta. ... Marlins RHP Drew Steckenrider, who earned his first major league win Monday night, was sent to Triple-A New Orleans to make room for Tuesday's starter, LHP Adam Conley. ... Phillies rookie RF Nick Williams was moved to third in the batting order for just the second time this season. ... Phillies RHP Luis Garcia has a career-long scoreless streak of 15 1/3 innings, dating to June 14. Batters are hitting just .132 against him during that stretch (7-for-53), and his streak as of Tuesday morning was the second-longest active run in the majors.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-phillies-marlins-writethru-idUSMTZED7JBFJHB6"},

The S&P;/ASX 200 index rose 37.91 points, or 0.7 percent, to 5,725.3 at 0237 GMT. The benchmark fell 1.1 percent on Tuesday. The 'Big Four' banks, which account for more than 80 percent of the country's lending, leapt between 2.9 to 3.8 percent to touch their highest intra-day peaks in eight months after the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) unveiled new rules designed to make the banks  unquestionably strong . The authority said they were required to raise common equity Tier 1 ratio, a key gauge of a lender's strength, to at least 10.5 percent by January 2020. The banks said they were well placed to meet the capital requirements. Ric Spooner, chief market strategist at CMC Markets, said it was positive that banks get options for raising equity capital,  creating a bit of certainty for the market.   This removes some of the worse concerns about the possibility  that the banks will have to go to shareholders for additional capital in the near future,  he said. Financial stocks accounted for nearly three-quarters of the gains on the bourse and the benchmark index of financial stocks at one point was up 2.7 percent, its biggest intraday gain in nearly 36 weeks. Weighing down the benchmark the most was global miner BHP Billiton. At one point, it dropped 2.6 percent to its lowest in four weeks, after reporting output declines in coal and petroleum for the year and flagging exceptional items of $546 million for the second half. Material stocks sagged as Rio Tinto extended losses, falling as much as 1.9 percent from the previous day after reporting disappointing production results. New Zealand's benchmark S&P;/NZX 50 index inched up 4.14 points, or 0.1 percent, to 5,725.5 at 0237 GMT. The benchmark was little changed as losses consumer staples offset gains in financial and industrial sectors.

The notes are likely to be issued on 25 July 2017 and are expected to count towards MUFG's total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC) requirements, which have been set by the Financial Stability Board at 16% of risk-weighted assets for globally systemically important banks like MUFG, effective 1 January 2019. Fitch believes MUFG will meet its minimum requirement for TLAC by the 2019 deadline through managed growth, earnings retention and issuance of TLAC-eligible securities. The senior bonds will constitute direct, unconditional, unsecured and unsubordinated general obligations of MUFG, and rank pari passu without any preference among themselves and with all of its other unsecured indebtedness, other than subordinated indebtedness and except for statutorily preferred indebtedness. The notes will be structurally subordinated to the liabilities of MUFG's subsidiaries, including Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd. (BTMU; A/Stable) and Mitsubishi UFJ Trust and Banking Corporation (MUTB; A/Stable). The proceeds will be downstreamed in full to the operating subsidiaries as obligations that rank pari passu with other senior unsecured obligations of the operating subsidiaries. KEY RATING DRIVERS The rating on the notes is aligned with the Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of MUFG, in line with Fitch's criteria. MUFG's IDR is based upon its Viability Rating (VR), and reflects the banking group's strong and very sound domestic franchises, solid liquidity profiles in yen, sound asset quality, adequate capital positions, and modest profitability. The rating also takes into consideration MUFG's efforts to trim its investment portfolio to reduce volatility in earnings and capitalisation, which counter the bank's rising appetite for risk outside Japan. The Stable Outlook reflects the similar Outlook on the Japan sovereign's rating (A/Stable). RATING SENSITIVITIES The rating on the senior unsecured notes issued by MUFG would be directly affected by a change in MUFG's IDRs, which would stem from a change in its VR. However, the rating would also then be underpinned by its 'A-' Support Rating Floor. Negative action could also stem from an unexpected change in the regulatory framework that clearly and significantly raises the loss severity of the notes relative to other senior unsecured debt.

The Nikkei share average was up 0.1 percent to 20,012.12 by midmorning after dipping into negative territory. U.S. Republican senators' effort to pass their own healthcare overhaul bill collapsed late on Tuesday, stoking doubts over the likelihood that Trump's growth-oriented economic agenda would come to fruition, sending the dollar lower. The firmer yen hit such cyclical stocks as automakers and banks as well as insurers. Toyota Motor Corp shed 1.0 percent, Nissan Motor Co declined 1.2 percent, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group fell 0.6 percent and Dai-ichi Life Holdings tumbled 1.6 percent. However, most investors on Wednesday downplayed the impact of a stronger yen on exporters' earnings, which limited the losses.  The current dollar-yen level is still above what most manufacturers expect this year, which is 108.80 yen,  said Nobuhiko Kuramochi, a strategist at Mizuho Securities, adding that the market expects strong earnings for April-June quarter, which start coming out later this month. The dollar slipped 0.1 percent on the day to 111.950 yen , after falling as low as 111.685 on Tuesday, its lowest since June 27. On Wednesday, defensive stocks attracted buying. Cosmetics maker Shiseido Co gained 1.7 percent, toiletry goods maker Kao Corp surged 3.0 percent and brewer Kirin Holdings Co soared 2.6 percent. A Reuters poll showed that Japanese manufacturers' and service providers' business confidence remained high in July, underlining the central bank's upbeat view on the economy. At a two-day rate review that ends on Thursday, the Bank Of Japan is seen likely to keep monetary policy steady even as it cuts its inflation forecast. The broader Topix was up 0.1 percent to 1,621.80 and the JPX-Nikkei Index 400 was flat at 14,412.38.

Simpson nears his date with Nevada's parole board this week, the consensus is he stands a good chance of winning release from prison in October, after serving nine years for a botched attempt to steal mementos from his sports career at gunpoint. But the one factor that could weigh against his seemingly solid case for parole is the notoriety still surrounding Simpson's acquittal in a sensational double-murder trial that gripped America two decades ago, according to some who have followed his case most closely.  What plays against him is the ghost of the murders,  Loyola Law School professor Laurie Levenson told Reuters on Tuesday. Anyone else fitting Simpson's inmate profile would be virtually assured of parole, she said, adding:  What we don't know is how much the O.J. factor will make a difference.  The four parole commissioners meeting on Thursday in Carson City are supposed to decide Simpson's fate on the basis of other factors, including his age, his conduct in prison and whether his release would poses a threat to public safety. Judged by such standards, inmate No. 1027820 at the Lovelock Correctional Center would by all accounts be well-suited for parole, clearing the way for him to walk free once he has finished serving the minimum term of his sentence on Oct. 1. Besides having already won a favorable parole ruling from the same commissioners four years ago before reaching eligibility for release, the 70-year-old former football star also lacks any prior felony convictions and is reported to have been a model inmate. 'Model Prisoner' Simpson was instrumental in mediating inmate disputes at Lovelock, served as an unofficial  athletic director  in the prison yard, led prayer groups and even lobbied for inmate education funding, said Nevada state Assemblyman Osvaldo Fumo, who was part of Simpson's legal team in a failed appeal of his conviction.  Based upon my knowledge of his background and behavior in prison, I expect he will be a very good candidate for getting parole,  David Roger, the retired Clark County district attorney who tried Simpson in 2008, said on Tuesday. In a similar assessment posted last week on the internet forum Reddit, incumbent D.A. Steve Wolfson said:  Most people who are ... 70 years old, who have been model prisoners, will be excellent candidates for parole. Mr. Simpson fits that description.  Wolfson noted that his wife, retired Judge Jackie Glass, presided over Simpson's Las Vegas trial, sentencing him to a term of nine to 33 years in prison. A jury found Simpson guilty of all 12 charges against him for storming into a Las Vegas hotel room in 2007 with four cohorts and holding two sports memorabilia dealers at gunpoint, then making off with thousands of dollars in items he said rightfully belonged to him. His conviction came exactly 13 years after his 1995 Los Angeles acquittal in the murder of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Ron Goldman, who were found stabbed and slashed to death in June 1994. A civil court jury later found Simpson liable for the deaths and awarded $33.5 million in damages to the victims' families, a judgment renewed in court for another decade and enlarged to about $58 million two years ago. It remains largely unpaid. Prosecutors said the Las Vegas robbery grew out of grudges Simpson had nursed since his murder trial and civil case. David Cook, longtime attorney for Goldman's father, Fred Goldman, called his client  the elephant in the room  as Simpson's fate is decided. He vowed to remain dogged in seeking to collect on the judgment against Simpson.  The good news for Mr. Simpson is he's probably going to get out on Oct. 1,  Cook said.  And the bad news is I'm good for another 10 years ... ready to pick up where we last left off.

The blue-chip CSI300 index rose 0.4 percent to 3,682.26 points by 0202 GMT, while the Shanghai Composite Index also gained 0.4 percent to 3,199.40. Banks and resources stocks led gains, with an index tracking coal shares up nearly 4 percent. But Shenzhen's start-up board ChiNext slid about 0.4 percent. ChiNext slumped over 5 percent on Monday after President Xi Jinping vowed on Sunday to take stronger action to deal with financial risks, as he announced the establishment of a new financial oversight body. Nearly 500 stocks, most of them small firms, plunged the 10 percent limit on Monday in what some media described as China's 'Black Monday'. China's securities regulator said late on Tuesday that it would support efforts to curb risks in capital markets, and would improve the quality of listed companies and improve the delisting system.

FUNDAMENTALS       * The most active corn futures on the Chicago Board Of Trade  were up 0.2 percent to $3.91-1/2 after gaining 0.7 percent in the previous session.     * The most active soybean futures were up 0.3 percent at $10.05 a bushel, having firmed 0.4 percent on Tuesday.     * The most active wheat futures were little changed at $5.04 a bushel, having closed down 0.4 percent on Tuesday.      * The U.S. Department of Agriculture late on Monday said 40 percent of the U.S. corn crop was going through the silking portion of its pollination phase as of Sunday. Hot temperatures and a lack of moisture could limit yield potential for corn plants.     * USDA also slashed good-to-excellent condition ratings for the corn, soybean and spring wheat crops, a move that analysts had anticipated.     * The state grain buyer for top global wheat importer Egypt said it purchased 300,000 tonnes of Russian, Romanian and French wheat.     * U.S. wheat remains uncompetitive, wieghing on prices.               MARKET NEWS       * The dollar hit its lowest against the euro and Swiss franc in more than a year on Tuesday, with the broader dollar index touching a more than 10-month low, on reduced confidence in U.S. President Donald Trump's agenda and jitters over hawkish central banks abroad.       * Oil prices rose slightly on Tuesday as Saudi exports fell and solid demand soaked up some of what is seen as an oversupplied market, but Ecuador's decision to opt out of an OPEC-led supply reduction pact complicated the outlook.       * A Netflix rally boosted the Nasdaq Composite to a record high on Tuesday while Goldman Sachs Group Inc dragged the Dow lower as earnings take center stage on Wall Street.

Brent crude futures, the international benchmark for oil prices, were at $48.73 per barrel at 0128 GMT, down 11 cents, or 0.2 percent, from their last close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $46.28 per barrel, down 12 cents, or 0.3 percent. U.S. crude stocks rose last week, adding 1.6 million barrels in the week to July 14 to 497.2 million barrels, industry group the American Petroleum Institute said late on Tuesday. Outside the United States, supplies from within the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) remained high, largely because of rising output from member-states Nigeria and Libya, despite the club's pledge to cut production.  Nigeria and Libya have made significant progress in reinstating their oil supply. Production in Libya is currently reported at or above 1 million barrels per day while August loading schedules for Nigeria have risen to just over 2 million barrels per day,  French bank BNP Paribas said.  The increment of crude oil supply from Nigeria and Libya in June vs. October 2016 reference production levels comes to 450,000 barrels per day on average. This is almost 40 percent of the 1.25 million barrels per day cut by the OPEC 10 members engaged in supply restraint,  it added. Nigeria and Libya are exempt from the deal between OPEC and other producers, including Russia, to cut production by around 1.8 million barrels per day between January this year and March 2018 in order to tighten the market and prop up prices.  Talk of capping Nigerian and Libyan output has been growing fast (within OPEC). But it is very unlikely that both countries will acquiesce to a cap so soon after restoring production,  BNP said.

The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) said on its website that it would also promote stable growth and focus on enhancing the capital market's financing of the real (non financial markets) economy. China is grappling with rising risks from misallocated investment that has built up since the global financial crisis and the government wants to improve supervision for what officials call  chaotic  financial markets. The regulator made those pledges after an internal party committee meeting. Xi announced on Saturday that a new financial oversight body would be set up under the cabinet and that the central bank would take on a bigger role in managing risks in financial markets.  The CSRC will earnestly implement the requests of the Financial Stability and Development Committee, conscientiously obey and rely on the (central bank's) leadership, in order to do a good job of reforming and ensuring stable development for the capital markets,  it said.

The punitive measures could come against Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino Lopez and Socialist Party No. 2 Diosdado Cabello for alleged rights violations, the U.S. officials told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity. Their comments followed President Donald Trump's vow on Monday to take  strong and swift economic actions  if Maduro went ahead with the new body that would have power to rewrite Venezuela's constitution and supersede all institutions.   All options are on the table,  including possible measures against Venezuela's vital oil sector such as banning its crude imports to the United States, a senior Trump administration  official told reporters on a conference call. Washington is seeking to head off the July 30 vote for a Constituent Assembly that it sees as Maduro's effort to create a  full dictatorship,  the administration official said.  The heightened U.S. rhetoric against Venezuela's ruling Socialist Party has infuriated Maduro but also provided him with a nationalist rallying cry. Related CoverageAll options on the table for dealing with Venezuela: U.S. officialVenezuela opposition calls for anti-Maduro strike on ThursdayViolent police raids on rise in Venezuela amid protestsDecrying  imperialism  still resonates for many in a region scarred by Washington's support of coups during the Cold War.  No one gives Venezuela orders, no foreign government,  Maduro told a specially convened state security council to analyze the U.S. threats.   Donald Trump is not the boss of Venezuela.  U.S. President Donald Trump speaks during a  Made in America  products showcase event at the White House in Washington, U.S., July 17, 2017.Carlos BarriaProtests Grow      Maduro vowed that the July 30 election would go ahead despite a boycott and escalating protests from a majority-backed Venezuelan opposition, and growing foreign condemnation from the European Union to major Latin American countries.   The Constituent Assembly should be abandoned ... The whole world is asking for that,  said Colombia's President Juan Manuel Santos. In his speech, Maduro condemned him and Brazil's President Michel Temer as  lackeys  of Washington.  The Trump administration's possible sanctions on Venezuelan officials would freeze their U.S. assets and prohibit anyone in the United States from doing business with them.  Slideshow (11 Images)Individual sanctions could come within days or else be delayed until after the July 30 vote, but no final decisions have been made and such actions could still be put on hold, one U.S. official told Reuters. Tough oil-related sanctions could bankrupt the Maduro government and worsen grave food shortages in the crisis-hit OPEC nation. Hitting Venezuela's energy sector could also raise U.S. domestic gasoline prices. Venezuela is the third largest foreign oil supplier to the United States, after Canada and Saudi Arabia, exporting about 780,000 barrels per day of crude. Polls show the ruling Socialists would be thrashed in any conventional election in Venezuela. A majority of people oppose the Constituent Assembly, which critics have said is a sham election skewed to give Maduro a majority.  He insists it is the only way to bring peace after months of anti-government unrest that has killed 100 people and further crippled the economy. Maduro's opponents said they drew 7.5 million people onto the streets at the weekend to vote in a symbolic referendum where 98 percent disagreed with the assembly.   Protesters blockaded parts of Caracas on Tuesday and a national strike was called for Thursday.

The disarray in the Republican-controlled Senate rattled financial markets as it cast doubt on the chances of getting Trump's other domestic policy priorities, such as tax reform, through a divided Congress. Trump said he was disappointed by the failure and suggested he might let the insurance markets created under Obamacare go under and then, potentially, work with Democrats on a rescue.  We're probably in that position where we'll just let Obamacare fail,  Trump told reporters at the White House.  We will let Obamacare fail, and then the Democrats are going to come to us.  U.S. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell announced a vote on a straight repeal of Obamacare, which would take effect in two years, after it became clear on Monday night that he did not have enough support to pass an overhaul of the healthcare law. He said on Tuesday that the vote would take place  early next week.  But prospects for the repeal vote appeared doomed with at least three Republican senators voicing opposition. Moderate Republican Senators Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska quickly announced they would not back repeal. With Democrats united in opposition, Republicans can only afford to lose two votes to pass the measure in the Senate, where they have a slim 52-48 majority.  I do not think that it’s going to be constructive to repeal a law that at this point is so interwoven within our healthcare system and then hope that over the next two years we will come up with some kind of replacement,  Collins told reporters. The failed effort to replace Obamacare raised new concerns for U.S. health insurers over whether the government would continue to fund billions of dollars in medical benefit subsidies.

About 20 million Americans gained insurance coverage through the law.  This has been a very, very challenging experience for all of us,  McConnell said, adding that the chamber needed to move on to issues like tax reform and a spending package to bolster the country's infrastructure. As the healthcare bill collapsed in the Senate, leaders in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives unveiled a budget plan putting a proposed tax code overhaul on the same partisan procedural path that led to the anti-Obamacare initiative’s chaotic downfall. Republicans had hoped to finish with healthcare before an upcoming August recess so they could tackle a wide-ranging rewrite of the U.S. tax code in September. Separate talks on taxes appear unlikely to reach Trump's pledge to reduce the corporate tax rate to 15 percent from 35 percent.     Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell speaks with the media about the recently withdrawn healthcare bill on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., July 18, 2017.Aaron P. BernsteinBut their failure exposed the sharp divide within Republicans' own ranks, with moderates concerned the healthcare bill's Medicaid cuts would take insurance away from millions of low-income Americans while conservatives backed the cuts and wanted even more dramatic changes to Obamacare. The U.S. dollar stumbled to a 10-month low against a basket of currencies and U.S. Treasury yields fell after the fresh setback to the healthcare bill raised investors' doubts about Trump's ability to enact tax cuts and infrastructure spending. Reaction in the stock market was muted, and analysts said the expectation for business-friendly legislation out of Washington is all but priced out of the stock market. “The healthcare hurdle pushes everything in Trump’s agenda to 2018,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities in New York.

In an early morning Twitter message, he said,  We were let down by all of the Democrats and a few Republicans. Most Republicans were loyal, terrific & worked really hard. We will return!  Trump had pushed hard to get a bill to repeal and replace Obamacare through the U.S. House of Representatives in May and celebrated the victory with lawmakers on the White House lawn. But with polls showing the Republican bill was unpopular, he later called it  mean  and did little to convince Republican senators to get a deal. Vice President Mike Pence said Trump supported the move to vote on a straight repeal of Obamacare.  Inaction is not an option,  Pence said at the National Retail Federation Conference in Washington.  Congress needs to step up, Congress needs to do their job, and Congress needs to do their job now.  In crafting a replacement, Republicans ran up against Obamacare's growing popularity. A Washington Post-ABC News poll published on Sunday showed Americans preferred it over the Republican alternative by a 2-1 margin.   Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer urged Republicans to start over and work with Democrats. Democratic Senator Patty Murray, the leading Democrat on the Senate health committee, said in an interview with Reuters that a bipartisan effort could help stabilize insurance markets. She said a bipartisan effort to fund cost-sharing subsidies that help cover premiums, deductibles and other medical expenses for about 7 million people who purchase health insurance on the individual market would  send a strong message to the market  and  create some stabilization that is much needed.  Within hours of the bill's failure, Republican Senate Health Committee Chairman Lamar Alexander said he will set hearings in the next few weeks on how to stabilize the individual insurance markets. Orrin Hatch, the Republican chair of the Senate Finance Committee, said on the Senate floor that the failure could mean Congress will have to bail out insurance markets  probably before the end of 2017.  For hospitals, shelving the bill relieves the near-term pressure of massive Medicaid reform, but the long-term plan for federal spending for states' Medicaid expansion is now murky.

The punitive measures could come against Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino Lopez and Socialist Party No. 2 Diosdado Cabello for alleged rights violations, the U.S. officials told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity. Their comments followed President Donald Trump's vow on Monday to take  strong and swift economic actions  if Maduro went ahead with the new body that would have power to rewrite Venezuela's constitution and supersede all institutions.   All options are on the table,  including possible measures against Venezuela's vital oil sector such as banning its crude imports to the United States, a senior Trump administration  official told reporters on a conference call. Washington is seeking to head off the July 30 vote for a Constituent Assembly that it sees as Maduro's effort to create a  full dictatorship,  the administration official said.  The heightened U.S. rhetoric against Venezuela's ruling Socialist Party has infuriated Maduro but also provided him with a nationalist rallying cry.

The Constituent Assembly should be abandoned ... The whole world is asking for that,  said Colombia's President Juan Manuel Santos. In his speech, Maduro condemned him and Brazil's President Michel Temer as  lackeys  of Washington.  The Trump administration's possible sanctions on Venezuelan officials would freeze their U.S. assets and prohibit anyone in the United States from doing business with them.  Slideshow (11 Images)Individual sanctions could come within days or else be delayed until after the July 30 vote, but no final decisions have been made and such actions could still be put on hold, one U.S. official told Reuters. Tough oil-related sanctions could bankrupt the Maduro government and worsen grave food shortages in the crisis-hit OPEC nation. Hitting Venezuela's energy sector could also raise U.S. domestic gasoline prices. Venezuela is the third largest foreign oil supplier to the United States, after Canada and Saudi Arabia, exporting about 780,000 barrels per day of crude. Polls show the ruling Socialists would be thrashed in any conventional election in Venezuela. A majority of people oppose the Constituent Assembly, which critics have said is a sham election skewed to give Maduro a majority.  He insists it is the only way to bring peace after months of anti-government unrest that has killed 100 people and further crippled the economy. Maduro's opponents said they drew 7.5 million people onto the streets at the weekend to vote in a symbolic referendum where 98 percent disagreed with the assembly.

The views expressed are his own.) Hedge funds have continued to cover their short positions in crude and refined products, but the impact on oil prices has been surprisingly muted so far, with a much smaller rally in prices than expected. Hedge funds and other money managers reduced short positions in the five main futures and options contracts linked to petroleum prices by a combined 69 million barrels in the week to July 11. Fund managers have cut the total number of short positions over two weeks by 116 million barrels, falling from a record 510 million barrels on June 27 to just 394 million barrels on July 11 (tmsnrt.rs/2v92ssF). Over the same period, total long positions increased by just 10 million barrels, rising from 815 million barrels to 825 million barrels, according to regulatory and exchange data. Short covering was widely expected after hedge funds established record or near-record short positions in most contracts by the end of June (“Hedge funds walk into a bear trap in oil”, Reuters, July 3). The concentration of short positions and relatively small number of long positions left the market looking stretched on the downside. Crowded trades such as this have often preceded a sharp price reversal in the past.  But instead of rallying, crude prices generally declined over the week between July 3 and July 11, and have only risen modestly since, indicating hedge funds found plenty of willing sellers as they closed their short positions. If oil traders became less confident about further falls in prices, there was no sign of them positioning for a rebound. Sentiment remains bearish despite the sustained draw in U.S. crude stocks, record U.S. refinery runs and repeated verbal interventions by OPEC sources. Hedge funds built large bullish positions twice earlier this year, in February and April, anticipating a tightening oil market and higher prices, only to be disappointed and incur significant losses both times. With investors’ patience wearing thin, few managers can afford to be wrong a third time, so many seem to be waiting on the sidelines until signs of market rebalancing are unambiguous.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-oil-hedge-funds-kemp-idUSKBN1A219Z"},

China's giant steel sector churned out 72.78 million tonnes of the stuff in June. That was equivalent to annualized production of 891 million tonnes.  The previous monthly output record was set in May 2014 at 71.16 million tonnes. This year, however, that historical landmark has been exceeded in every month since February.  There may be some statistical smoke and mirrors at work behind this record-breaking production run.  But the underlying reality is that China's steel mills are being incentivized to lift production rates by strong prices. That of Shanghai steel rebar, used primarily in the construction sector, was last week trading at levels not seen since the end of 2013.  There are solid fundamental foundations for this price performance.  But there is a lot of speculative money in the mix as well with open interest on the Shanghai Futures Exchange's (ShFE) steel contracts also notching up fresh records on a near daily basis.  Beijing is no doubt keeping a wary eye on the Trump Administration's national security investigation into imports of foreign steel, but the most pressing threat to China's steel producers might be the country's own investors.   Capacity Down, Production Up The strength of China's steel production might appear strange, given the government's efforts to close outdated, polluting capacity.  Beijing claims to have phased out 65 million tonnes of capacity last year and another 42 million tonnes in the first five months of this year. As such, it's well ahead of its stated five-year target of closing between 100 and 150 million tonnes.  So how come the country is producing record amounts of steel then?  Because the official capacity closure targets come with two important caveats.  The first is that a significant part of what has been  closed  wasn't actually producing steel anyway. Dismantling older, unutilized production lines has been an easy way for China's steel producers to tick Beijing's supply-side reform boxes.  Secondly, the official targets don't include the elimination of what the Chinese call  DeTiaoGang , substandard steel, particularly rebar, produced by smaller operators using scrap rather than iron ore as a feed.  Since Beijing classifies  DeTiaoGang  as illegal, unapproved capacity, it does not count towards the official capacity cut targets.  And crucially, it has never been included in the official production figures either.  Its unofficial status means that nobody knows for sure how much  DeTiaoGang  is produced but the consensus estimate is that it is definitely more than 100 million tonnes per year. To put that figure into context, China's official production last year was 808 million tonnes.  What this means is that part of the current strength of Chinese steel production is a statistical illusion, official countable output rising to fill the gap left by the closure of unofficial, uncounted output.  Strong Fundamentals... The authorities claim to have closed 600  DeTiaoGang  steel producers with combined capacity of 120 million tonnes in the first half of the year. The stated aim is to completely eliminate all such  backward  capacity by the end of this year.  The effectiveness of the ongoing clamp-down seems to have led to pockets of tightness in the domestic steel supply chain.  Even with production running at record levels, there has been no discernible build in steel inventory in the country and exports remain subdued, falling by 28 percent, or 16 million tonnes, in the first half of the year.  Demand from the construction sector remains robust.  The latest batch of real estate indicators out this morning showed investment in the sector slowing marginally in the second quarter relative to the first but still running at a brisk pace.   Crucially, new construction starts measured by floor area rose by 14.0 percent in June, which was the fastest rate of growth since October 2016. Strong demand and falling supply, even if statistically elusive, go a long way to explain the strength of Shanghai steel rebar prices. Graphic on ShFE steel rebar: price, open interest and volume:  tmsnrt.rs/2v9WUy7 ...Stronger Speculation There is, however, a third element in this bullish steel cocktail.  Open interest on the Shanghai rebar contract has also been setting fresh records.  It ended May at 4.61 million contracts, comfortably exceeding the previous end-month record of 4.0 million dating from November 2015.   By the end of June open interest had exceeded the 5.0-million mark for the first time ever. It has been holding above that level in the two weeks since.  Rising open interest has coincided with a rising price, suggesting that speculative money has come in on the long side.  Now, it wouldn't be the first time that Chinese investors have crowd-surged into the commodities space. Such was the speculative frenzy seen in the first part of last year that it took multiple hikes in trading fees across multiple exchanges to drive them back. This time around, however, things look a bit different.  Last year's speculative bubble was characterized by spikes in trading volumes but with little change in open interest, a combination indicative of a day-trading crowd.   Volumes on the Shanghai rebar contract are currently high but a long way off the elevated levels seen last year.  The inference is that the speculative flows currently entering the market are both more structured and controlled by larger entities happy to leave positions in place for days if not weeks.  Something similar seems to be happening with the ShFE's contract for hot-rolled coil (HRC), a steel product with manufacturing rather than construction applications.  The HRC contract was only launched in March 2014 and is therefore something of a little sister to the more mature rebar contract. But it too has seen open interest hit record levels above 800,000 contracts in the last couple of days.  As with rebar, the build in open interest has coincided with rising prices but with no dramatic spike in trading volumes.  Betting the House on Home-Building Chinese investors, it seems, are betting the house on more home-building and more steel capacity closures.  There is nothing right now to suggest they are wrong to do so but the size of their collective positioning in Shanghai should ring alarm bells.  Because markets don't move in straight lines and at some stage a price correction will come. The danger is the next one will trigger a disorderly stampede for the exit door, compounding pricing weakness and sending shock waves along the steel supply chain.  It may yet be Chinese funds not the U.S. president that trump the current positive dynamic in China's steel sector.

However, U.N. investigators say they cannot yet lay blame for the murders based on the preliminary evidence.  American Michael Sharp, coordinator of the independent monitoring group, and Swede Zaida Catalan were killed in central Congo on March 12 while carrying out investigations for the annual report to the U.N. Security Council, dated June 30. The remaining members of the monitoring group wrote that they had retrieved an audio tape, dated March 11, of Sharp and Catalan speaking with representatives of the family of the late Kamuina Nsapu militia leader Jean-Pierre Mpandi, who they said was killed by Congolese troops last August. This is the first time the existence of this tape has been reported.   Parts of the discussion concerned a field visit scheduled for the following day,  they wrote in the 35-page report.  The tape confirmed that the investigation aimed at a better understanding of Kamuina Nsapu's structure, its support networks and the potential recruitment and use of children.  On March 12, Sharp and Catalan left the provincial capital of Kananga to travel toward Bunkonde. At about 4 p.m. they  were executed by a heteroclite group of individuals not yet identified,  wrote the monitors, who said they did not yet have the enough evidence to lay blame for the killings.   However, the available evidence does not preclude the involvement of different actors, such as (pro or anti-government) Kamuina Nsapu factions, other armed groups, as well as members of state security services,  said the report. Murky Alliances The bodies of Sharp and Catalan were found in a shallow grave two weeks after they disappeared.  More than 3,300 people have been killed and 1.4 million forced to flee their homes in Kasai since the start of the insurrection nearly a year ago by the Kamuina Nsapu militia, which wants the withdrawal of military forces from the area.  Yet the U.N. monitors noted in their report that  throughout 2017 this conflict moved away from an insurrection of a specific community towards a larger upheaval, spreading the Kamuina Nsapu label far beyond its initial confines.   A still image from an undated video of Swedish national Zaida Catalan taken in an unknown location in Sweden. TV4 Sweden/Handout via Reuters TV Sources told the group that while many factions were hostile to the government, government militias have also emerged operating under the Kamuina Nsapu label,  wrote the monitors, who accused Congolese troops of using  disproportionate violence  against the Kamuina Nsapu.  The Congolese government screened a film to reporters in Kinshasa on April 24, which they said showed members of anti-government Kamuina Nsapu killing the U.N experts.  The video appeared to show Sharp and Catalan walking with a group of men wearing red headbands characteristic of the Kamuina Nsapu militia. The pair are next seen sitting on the ground and then shot. Catalan is subsequently beheaded. Many analysts say the grainy video of the murders raises more questions than it answers, such as why one of the assassins from the Tshiluba-speaking militia gave orders in Lingala, which is the language of western Congo and the army. Call for u.n. Investigation The same week that Sharp and Catalan disappeared, Kamuina Nsapu representatives met Interior Minister Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary for peace talks in Kananga. Congolese U.N. Ambassador Ignace Gata Mavita wa Lufuta told the Security Council last week that 11 people had been arrested in connection with the murders, including eight who had been accused of direct involvement.   The group notes that other key suspects of the murder have not yet been arrested despite available evidence,  the U.N. monitors wrote.  In May 2017 the group spoke to a senior police officer who denounced the lack of cooperation on the side of the government security services involved in the investigations.   The monitors also warned that the Congolese government's repeated spreading of the video of the killings  could obstruct ongoing criminal investigations.  The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation, Swedish police authorities and Congolese military justice are conducting criminal investigations, according to the report, and the United Nations has established a board of inquiry into the murders.  The U.N. monitors recommended that the Security Council ask U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to establish an independent international investigation  to gather evidence, to identify the perpetrators, their support networks and motives.

Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko rejected the idea, describing Alexander Zakharchenko, leader of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic (DNR), as part of  a puppet show , with Russia pulling his strings in order to relay a message. France and Germany, which are involved in diplomatic efforts to end the Ukraine crisis, also condemned the proposal. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Russian agencies that Zakharchenko's statement was Zakharchenko's own initiative and that the Kremlin had learned about it from media reports. Ukrainian officials contend that Russia wants to show the world, and the United States especially, that it can keep the crisis in a suspended state and deepen it if need be. A new U.S. envoy for the Ukraine crisis was appointed this month and Moscow and Washington are likely to start regularly engaging on the issue. Zakharchenko, who would scarcely have expected anything other than outright rejection from Kiev, said in a declaration that he and his allies were proposing a new state called Malorossiya (Little Russia) be set up with its capital in rebel-held Donetsk. Malorossiya was the term used to describe swaths of modern-day Ukraine when they were part of the Russian Empire in tsarist times and is one many Ukrainians today regard as offensive. Ukraine, a country of about 42.5 million people, declared independence from Moscow in 1991. A local resident sits in his house, which was damaged by a recent shelling, in the rebel-controlled city of Donetsk, Ukraine.Alexander Ermochenko We are proposing to residents of Ukraine a peaceful way out of a difficult situation without war. It's our last proposal,  Zakharchenko said in a statement. The new state would be federal, with regions enjoying a large degree of autonomy. He said the move was backed by delegates from various Ukrainian regions, but a statement from the neighboring rebel territory of the self-proclaimed Luhansk People's Republic said it had been unaware of the initiative and did not support it.  Sick Fantasies  His declaration cast a shadow over the faltering Minsk peace agreement between the rebels and the Ukrainian government, which has failed to quell fighting between the two sides and has only been partially implemented since a pro-Russian uprising erupted in eastern Ukraine in 2014. Russia denies accusations it has delivered arms and provided troops backing rebels in the industrial, largely Russian-speaking east. On Tuesday the Kremlin said it remained committed to the Minsk peace deal.  Yevhen Marchuk, Ukraine's representative in the talks on implementing the peace deal, told Ukrainian TV channel 112.ua that Zakharchenko's declaration would complicate negotiations and looked like a Russian attempt to sabotage the process. France condemned the idea and demanded Russia do more to prevent a further escalation. A German government spokeswoman also criticized the move, calling it  totally unacceptable .  Ukraine's top military commander, Viktor Muzhenko, said on social media that the Ukrainian people would  bury  Malorossiya, calling the plan one of the rebels'  sick fantasies .  Three former rebel leaders told Reuters in May that a top aide to Russian President Vladimir Putin decides how the pro-Moscow administration of eastern Ukraine is run and who gets what jobs there, challenging Kremlin denials that it calls the shots in the region.

My hope is that we can increase our focus on concrete and targeted commitments to address both short-term and long-term strategic challenges,  Mnuchin said at the luncheon of mainly business executives with China ties. Ross said some initial deals announced in April, as part of a 100-day economic plan aimed at reducing the U.S. trade deficit with China, were a  good start.  These include the sale of U.S. beef in China for the first time in 14 years and commitments to open up narrow areas of China's financial services sector, such as credit card services and credit ratings agencies. Some of these agreements are yet to be implemented, and there has been little evidence of progress on thornier issues, such as excess capacity in China's steel and aluminum sectors.     A looming Trump administration decision on whether to impose broad steel tariffs based on national security concerns is casting a cloud of uncertainty over the talks, which have been rebranded this year as the  U.S.-China Comprehensive Economic Dialogue             Ross acknowledged that the dialogue has become more challenging as U.S. and Chinese officials grapple with more sensitive issues.

According to a translated text of his remarks, Wang said allowing such sales to China would help reduce the U.S. trade deficit, noting that China imported $227 billion worth of integrated circuits last year, but only 4 percent of that came from the United States. He said that the United States and China had no choice but to cooperate economically even if they wanted to buy and hire locally.  It is important that both sides come to realize with cool heads that given the depth of our business cooperation, neither Chinese nor Americans can do without goods from the other country,  Wang said.

Republican efforts to overhaul or repeal Obamacare collapsed in the U.S. Senate on Tuesday, rattling financial markets and casting doubt on the chances of getting Trump's economic plans, such as tax reform and stimulus, through a divided Congress. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, edged up 0.1 percent to 94.694 after falling as low as 94.476 on Tuesday, its lowest level since September 2016. The euro was steady on the day at $1.1549, after rising as high as $1.1583 on Tuesday, its highest since May 2016. Expectations that the Federal Reserve will be more cautious about raising interest rates also weighed on the greenback. Economic data on Tuesday showed U.S. import prices falling for a second straight month in June as the cost of petroleum products declined further, suggesting inflation pressures could remain benign for a while. Fed Chair Janet Yellen signalled caution last week in her congressional testimony, and disappointing U.S. inflation and retail sales data on Friday added to evidence that the central bank has reason to take its time in tightening.  The failure of the healthcare bill added the newest pressure to the dollar, but it was already under pressure after Yellen's comments last week,  said Mitsuo Imaizumi, Tokyo-based chief foreign exchange strategist for Daiwa Securities. The Fed chief referred to  uncertainty,  he said, a word that  makes markets nervous,  and prompted them to pare their expectations of another interest rate hike this year, he said. The dollar slipped 0.1 percent on the day to 111.950 yen , well below its nearly four-month high of 114.495 touched last week. It fell as low as 111.685 on Tuesday, its lowest since June 27. The Bank of Japan will conclude a policy meeting on Thursday. Policymakers are expected to raise their economic growth forecasts but cut their rosy inflation outlook next week, sources say, reinforcing expectations it will lag well behind major global central banks in dialling back its massive stimulus programme. A majority of economists polled by Reuters expect the BOJ to delay again its projected timing for achieving the 2 percent inflation target. The Australian dollar was up 0.1 percent at $0.7918 after surged 1.5 percent to two-year highs on Tuesday as minutes of the last meeting of the country's central bank showed policymakers turned more upbeat on the economic outlook.

Trimming the VAT rate gradually to 15 percent from 18 percent had been part of Kuczynski's economic platform as he took office a year ago, before severe flooding and a graft scandal thwarted investments and knocked Peru's growth outlook. Dropping the plan will likely be welcomed by the right-wing opposition that had feared a VAT reduction would widen the fiscal deficit. But it could be seen as a broken campaign promise by Kuczynski allies who expected a lower rate to stimulate the economy and encourage more people to pay the tax.   Reducing the VAT has been ruled out,  Prime Minister Fernando Zavala told foreign media in a press conference.  Tax revenues haven't grown in recent months and we think we have to improve that in coming years by making VAT collection more efficient.  Kuczynski named Zavala finance minister while keeping him in his post as prime minister last month after the opposition-controlled Congress ousted the former finance minister over a scandal involving an airport contract. Peru, the world's second biggest copper, zinc and silver producer, has enjoyed some of the strongest growth readings and slowest inflation rates in the region this century. Peru's Prime Minister and Finance Minister Fernando Zavala gives a news conference in Lima, Peru, July 18, 2017 .Mariana BazoBut the economy will likely slow to 2.8 percent this year from 3.9 percent in 2016, even with the government's planned fiscal stimulus, Zavala said. Next year the economy should expand by between 3.8 percent to 4 percent, he added. The government previously forecast growth at 3 percent in 2017 and 4.5 percent in 2018.    Slideshow (2 Images)Zavala reiterated that the government planned to expand the fiscal deficit to 3 percent of gross domestic product this year and to 3.5 percent next year to pay to rebuild parts of Peru devastated by floods this year.  It's a deficit increase but only for resources for the reconstruction and only for a period of 3 to 4 years,  Zavala said.  We're taking all the measures necessary for the economy to accelerate.  Peru will likely sell sovereign bonds again next year to finance government spending or to extend the life of the country's debt, Zavala said. On Monday, Peru sold some $3 billion in sol-denominated bonds that can be settled through post-trade services provider Euroclear, part of the country's efforts to reduce debt in foreign currencies.

The second conversation between Trump and Putin took place during a dinner for the Group of 20 heads of state and their spouses in Hamburg, said Ian Bremmer, the president of political risk consultancy Eurasia Group, who was first to report the meeting in a note to clients. Television coverage of the dinner showed that first lady Melania Trump was seated next to Putin. Bremmer said Trump got up from his seat halfway through dinner and spent about an hour talking  privately and animatedly  with Putin,  joined only by Putin's own translator.  The lack of a U.S. translator raised eyebrows among other leaders at the dinner, said Bremmer, who called it a  breach of national security protocol.  Trump is under intense scrutiny by Congress and a special counsel investigating Russian interference into the 2016 presidential election, and probing whether Trump's campaign had ties to the activity.

Detroit, struggling to a 42-49 record, looked to the future, while Arizona (53-39) improved their lineup in their quest for a wild card playoff berth. The 29-year-old Martinez missed nearly the first six weeks of the season after suffering a Lisfranc sprain in his right foot during spring training, yet was batting .305 with 16 home runs and 39 RBIs in 57 games.  I wish we would have come out and been hot and been in first place right now,  Martinez said.  And all of a sudden, we're in the playoff hunt here.  God has got other plans. That's where he wants me. I've just got to take it for what it is and be excited in joining another good organization in Arizona. I've just got to go out there and help them win.  Martinez clubbed 83 homers in his previous three seasons with Detroit, establishing career highs with 38 blasts and 102 RBIs in 2015. Martinez batted over .300 in three of four seasons with Detroit after spending his first three major league campaigns with the Houston Astros. Lugo was rated the Diamondbacks' No. 2 overall prospect by Baseball America. The 22-year-old was is batting .282 with seven home runs and 43 RBIs in 88 games at Double-A Jacksonville this season. The switch-hitting Alcantara was batting .279 with three homers and 28 RBIs at Class A Visalia, while King, 18, was playing in the Arizona Rookie League.

On Wednesday, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's rule abolishing  mandatory arbitration  clauses will be published in a directory of regulatory actions called the Federal Register, starting the timer for two possible ways of undoing it. The rule bans companies from requiring customers to sign agreements when opening new accounts that they will not join a group lawsuit, or class action, in the event of a dispute. Critics say such lawsuits only benefit lawyers and that arbitration is a quick, cost-effective alternative to the courts. Once the rule is published, anyone sitting on the council of the country's top financial regulators can petition for a stay within 10 days by showing it significantly risks injuring the banking system. One member, Acting Comptroller of the Currency Keith Noreika, started moving toward that step after the rule's final version was released last week. The rule will also be open to possible nullification under the Congressional Review Act. Already powerful Senate Republicans, including Banking Committee Chairman Mike Crapo, are drafting a resolution to kill the rule. Under the Congressional Review Act, Congress could take up to six months to consider the resolution. However, both attempts to stymie the rule could fail. Noreika contends his office has not been able to review data used to write the rule. He and CFPB Director Richard Cordray have exchanged slightly hostile letters over the last week, and on Tuesday Cordray wrote that the CFPB is  assembling the data your staff has requested.  Noreika replied in a statement that he would  conduct an independent review of the data and analysis in a timely manner.” But Cordray says his agency released a thorough analysis two years ago and a rulemaking proposal more than a year ago that was accompanied by extensive research. Cordray also points out that Congress banned the arbitration clauses from mortgages and did not injure that market, casting doubt on Noreika's safety and soundness concerns. In the Senate, a nullification resolution could be crowded out by other, more pressing business. A third line of attack is less bound by time. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is currently looking into its options, including litigation, but has not decided its response, a spokeswoman for the lobbying group told Reuters.

The measures signaled that the administration of President Donald Trump was seeking to put more pressure on Iran while keeping in place an agreement between Tehran and six world powers to curb its nuclear program in return for lifting international oil and financial sanctions. The U.S. government said it was targeting 18 entities and people for supporting what is said was  illicit Iranian actors or transnational criminal activity.  Those sanctioned had backed Iran's military or Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps by developing drones and military equipment, producing and maintaining boats, and procuring electronic components, it said. Others had  orchestrated the theft of U.S. and Western software programs  sold to Iran's government, the Treasury Department said.   The United States remains deeply concerned about Iran's malign activities across the Middle East which undermine regional stability, security, and prosperity,  the State Department said in a statement. It said the activities  undercut whatever 'positive contributions' to regional and international peace and security were intended to emerge  from the nuclear agreement.  On Monday, the Trump administration said Iran was complying with the nuclear agreement but it was also in default of the spirit of the accord and Washington would look for ways to strengthen it. It was the second time Trump certified Iranian compliance with the agreement since he took office in January, despite having described it as  the worst deal ever  during his 2016 presidential campaign, criticizing then-President Barack Obama whose administration negotiated the accord.  Even as we continue to work to prevent Iran from ever obtaining a nuclear weapon, we cannot look away while Iran threatens our country and our allies in ways beyond their nuclear threat,  White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters on Tuesday. 'Poison the Atmosphere' The statement listed Iranian support for groups including Lebanon's Hezbollah and the Palestinian Hamas movement, the Syrian government of President Bashar al-Assad and Houthi rebels in Yemen. Iran condemned Washington's sanctions announcement as  contemptible and worthless.  Iran  will reciprocate the move by imposing sanctions on a number of American natural and legal persons who have taken steps against the Iranian people and other Muslim nations in the region,  the foreign ministry said in a statement. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif told CBS News the sanctions  poison the atmosphere  and violate the  spirit  of the nuclear agreement.  We will look at it and see whether it violates the letter of the deal. And we will act accordingly,  he said. The Trump administration is reviewing policy on Iran, not only looking at Tehran's compliance with the nuclear deal but also its behavior in the region which Washington says undermines U.S. interests in Syria, Iraq, Yemen and Lebanon. Trump's reservations about the nuclear deal held up the White House's announcement on compliance, a U.S. official said.  In the end, Trump agreed reluctantly to recertify the agreement after being advised repeatedly by his top national security aides to do so, another senior U.S. official said. Behind the scenes, advisers argued that there was no alternative but to recertify the deal for now because the past sanctions regime the United States had with European allies against Iran is no longer in place and unilateral sanctions are not as effective as multilateral ones. The State Department also called on the Iranian government to release U.S. citizens Baquer Namazi, Siamak Namazi, Xiyue Wang and other  unjustly detained U.S. citizens  and said it was deeply concerned about reports of their declining health.  Iran should immediately release all of these U.S. citizens on humanitarian grounds,  the State Department said.

Experts on police procedure said the most common reasons for failure to turn on cameras nationally were officers' forgetting or getting caught by surprise, not trying to hide something. The American Civil Liberties Union said the case showed a need for better compliance and training. Justine Damond, who was originally from Sydney, was shot around midnight on Saturday by an officer responding to an emergency call she had placed about a possible assault behind her house in a quiet residential neighborhood. Authorities said the officer shot the 40-year-old woman through the window as she approached his patrol car. Neither the officer's body camera nor a dashboard camera were turned on, depriving authorities of potential evidence.  There's a knee jerk assumption that something nefarious is occurring  when cameras are not turned on, said spokesman Steve Tuttle of Axon Enterprise Inc, a leading maker of body cameras formerly called Taser International and the manufacturer of the equipment used in Minneapolis. Malfunctions are rare, but when police are facing lethal danger, an officer is  not going to call time out  to turn on the camera, he said. Officers currently must press a button to enable the cameras to record video and audio, and Axon will soon release a sensor that will trigger cameras to turn on when a gun is taken from its holster, he said. The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, which reviews shootings involving the police in Minneapolis, is seeking any civilian video of the incident. It said the officer who shot Damond, who has been identified Mohamed Noor, and the officer in the patrol car with him, Matthew Harrity, have been placed on administrative leave. Police have declined comment on questions about the cameras, pending an investigation. The lack of video footage has led the city's mayor to call for a probe, while the American Civil Liberties Union suggested the police violated policy by failing to switch on the cameras. Advocates said that when used, cameras protect both officers and the public and in some cases have reduced use of force and complaints against police.  They should be on, every time,  said Steve Soboroff, a member of the Los Angeles Police Commission. Rigorous training and accountability is needed to ensure compliance, especially when police officers are under pressure.  Use Cameras 'When Safe,' Guidelines Say The technology has been adopted by police departments across the country since 2014 after a police shooting of a Missouri teenager sparked nationwide demonstrations over police treatment of minorities. Video evidence might have clarified whether the officer involved in that incident was justified in the shooting. Minneapolis rolled out cameras late last year, and the department adopted guidelines calling for officers to activate them  when safe  in a variety of situations including traffic stops, emergency responses, vehicle pursuits, searches and before any use of force or contact with citizens.  There is only spotty national evidence available about how frequently police fail to turn on cameras. An Arizona State University study in 2014 found fewer than half of police incidents in Phoenix were recorded. At least 14 people were killed by officers wearing body cams that were either not turned on or inoperative since 2014, the ACLU said in December. Even so, that was a tiny fraction of police-involved shootings. Jim Pasco, a senior adviser with the Fraternal Order of Police, said non-compliance among police is not widespread, and a Pew Research Center report earlier this year found 66 percent of police supported the use of body cameras. ACLU analyst Jay Stanley pointed to a KSTP-TV report based on Minneapolis police data showing officers on average uploaded no more than 6.1 hours of camera footage in March.  The department on Tuesday said the data was part of a study under way and that no conclusions had been reached. Despite legitimate circumstances when police cannot turn on cameras, the Minneapolis shooting illustrates the need to boost training and compliance.  Training is critical,  said Samuel Walker, a professor emeritus of criminal justice at the University of Omaha.  This is a relatively new experiment, and there is a learning curve.

Trump, who campaigned on reviving the U.S. manufacturing sector, vowed on Monday that his administration would crack down on  predatory online sales of foreign goods  hurting U.S. retailers. On Wednesday, Trump will discuss with small- and medium-sized manufacturers how to certify their products and keep out foreign counterfeits, a senior administration official told reporters. Their products include gutter filters, flags and pillows.  There's just too many examples of foreigners slapping on 'Made in America' labels to products and the worst insult is when they do it after they have actually stolen the product design,  the official said. The United States loses about $300 billion a year to theft of intellectual property ranging from semiconductors to jeans, the official said. In March, Trump signed an executive order that gave customs officials more authority to stop pirated and counterfeit items, the official told reporters.

The disarray in the Republican-controlled Senate rattled financial markets as it cast doubt on the chances of getting Trump's other domestic policy priorities, such as tax reform, through a divided Congress. Trump said he was disappointed by the failure and suggested he might let the insurance markets created under Obamacare go under and then, potentially, work with Democrats on a rescue.  We're probably in that position where we'll just let Obamacare fail,  Trump told reporters at the White House.  We will let Obamacare fail, and then the Democrats are going to come to us.  U.S. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell announced a vote on a straight repeal of Obamacare, which would take effect in two years, after it became clear on Monday night that he did not have enough support to pass an overhaul of the healthcare law. He said on Tuesday that the vote would take place  early next week.  But prospects for the repeal vote appeared doomed with at least three Republican senators voicing opposition. Moderate Republican Senators Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska quickly announced they would not back repeal. With Democrats united in opposition, Republicans can only afford to lose two votes to pass the measure in the Senate, where they have a slim 52-48 majority.  I do not think that it’s going to be constructive to repeal a law that at this point is so interwoven within our healthcare system and then hope that over the next two years we will come up with some kind of replacement,  Collins told reporters. The failed effort to replace Obamacare raised new concerns for U.S. health insurers over whether the government would continue to fund billions of dollars in medical benefit subsidies. Obamacare has boosted the number of Americans with health insurance through mandates on individuals and employers, and income-based subsidies. About 20 million Americans gained insurance coverage through the law.  This has been a very, very challenging experience for all of us,  McConnell said, adding that the chamber needed to move on to issues like tax reform and a spending package to bolster the country's infrastructure. As the healthcare bill collapsed in the Senate, leaders in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives unveiled a budget plan putting a proposed tax code overhaul on the same partisan procedural path that led to the anti-Obamacare initiative’s chaotic downfall. Republicans had hoped to finish with healthcare before an upcoming August recess so they could tackle a wide-ranging rewrite of the U.S. tax code in September. Separate talks on taxes appear unlikely to reach Trump's pledge to reduce the corporate tax rate to 15 percent from 35 percent. But their failure exposed the sharp divide within Republicans' own ranks, with moderates concerned the healthcare bill's Medicaid cuts would take insurance away from millions of low-income Americans while conservatives backed the cuts and wanted even more dramatic changes to Obamacare. The U.S. dollar stumbled to a 10-month low against a basket of currencies and U.S. Treasury yields fell after the fresh setback to the healthcare bill raised investors' doubts about Trump's ability to enact tax cuts and infrastructure spending. Reaction in the stock market was muted, and analysts said the expectation for business-friendly legislation out of Washington is all but priced out of the stock market. “The healthcare hurdle pushes everything in Trump’s agenda to 2018,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities in New York.  Congress Needs to Step Up  Trump vowed that the healthcare effort was not dead. In an early morning Twitter message, he said,  We were let down by all of the Democrats and a few Republicans. Most Republicans were loyal, terrific & worked really hard. We will return!  Trump had pushed hard to get a bill to repeal and replace Obamacare through the U.S. House of Representatives in May and celebrated the victory with lawmakers on the White House lawn. But with polls showing the Republican bill was unpopular, he later called it  mean  and did little to convince Republican senators to get a deal. Vice President Mike Pence said Trump supported the move to vote on a straight repeal of Obamacare.  Inaction is not an option,  Pence said at the National Retail Federation Conference in Washington.  Congress needs to step up, Congress needs to do their job, and Congress needs to do their job now.  In crafting a replacement, Republicans ran up against Obamacare's growing popularity. A Washington Post-ABC News poll published on Sunday showed Americans preferred it over the Republican alternative by a 2-1 margin. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer urged Republicans to start over and work with Democrats. Democratic Senator Patty Murray, the leading Democrat on the Senate health committee, said in an interview with Reuters that a bipartisan effort could help stabilize insurance markets. She said a bipartisan effort to fund cost-sharing subsidies that help cover premiums, deductibles and other medical expenses for about 7 million people who purchase health insurance on the individual market would  send a strong message to the market  and  create some stabilization that is much needed.  Within hours of the bill's failure, Republican Senate Health Committee Chairman Lamar Alexander said he will set hearings in the next few weeks on how to stabilize the individual insurance markets. Orrin Hatch, the Republican chair of the Senate Finance Committee, said on the Senate floor that the failure could mean Congress will have to bail out insurance markets  probably before the end of 2017.  For hospitals, shelving the bill relieves the near-term pressure of massive Medicaid reform, but the long-term plan for federal spending for states' Medicaid expansion is now murky.

The simplification of the PIS/Cofins federal social security contributions levied on gross receipts would face easier passage in Congress and allow Temer to show his wavering allies that his administration is still advancing on its promised reform agenda.  There won't be the political environment to approve pension reform until the issue of the charges is out of the way,  said the aide, who requested anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter. Federal prosecutors charged Temer last month with taking bribes. Though his government is confident it has the backing in Congress to stop a trial by the Supreme Court, that support could melt away if his administration is seen to be paralyzed. In a video statement released on social media on Monday, Temer said tax reform was a priority and a bill would be sent to Congress in  very little time.   He has held talks this week on the tax reform with his economic team and a series of lawmakers. Temer pointed to approval last week of a measure modernizing Brazil's labor laws as a sign his government is still working.  We know it is difficult to pass pension reform. It is clear there is no climate for that now,  said Lucio Vieira Lima, the deputy leader of the ruling PMDB party in the lower chamber of Congress.  The tax measure will be sent to Congress after the two-week recess that began on Tuesday, the aide said.  It will not tackle the more complicated levies in Brazil's burdensome tax system, the ICMS tax on circulation of goods and the ISS tax on services.

The monetary authority sold 467.623 billion pesos ($27.11 billion) in Lebac securities, compared with the 532.022 billion pesos worth of securities that matured. It raised the interest rate on the 28-day Lebac, the shortest-term security on offer, to 26.5 percent, up from 25.5 percent last month.  The central bank is targeting inflation of between 12 percent and 17 percent this year, well below economists' expectations for 21.5 percent inflation. Consumer prices rose 11.8 percent in the first half of the year.  Core inflation has shown a persistence with which we're not completely comfortable,  central bank President Federico Sturzenegger told reporters on Tuesday.  This persistence of core inflation is what has obliged us, or driven us, or motivated us to harden our monetary policy stance.   The central bank no longer considers the short-term Lebac yield as its benchmark interest rate, turning instead to the seven-day interbank lending rate at the start of this year. It hiked that rate to 26.25 percent in April and has since held the rate steady.

Alternatively, Abercrombie could sell its real estate assets that make up a  substantial portion  of its market value and use the proceeds from the sale to buy back shares, the investor added.  A repurchase of almost 30 percent of Abercrombie's shares would be an important illustration of management's confidence in the turnaround and the attractiveness of the stock at current prices,  SLS said.

The simplification of the PIS/Cofins federal social security contributions levied on gross receipts would face easier passage in Congress and allow Temer to show his wavering allies that his administration is still advancing on its promised reform agenda.  There won't be the political environment to approve pension reform until the issue of the charges is out of the way,  said the aide, who requested anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter. Federal prosecutors charged Temer last month with taking bribes. Though his government is confident it has the backing in Congress to stop a trial by the Supreme Court, that support could melt away if his administration is seen to be paralyzed. In a video statement released on social media on Monday, Temer said tax reform was a priority and a bill would be sent to Congress in  very little time.   He has held talks this week on the tax reform with his economic team and a series of lawmakers. Temer pointed to approval last week of a measure modernizing Brazil's labor laws as a sign his government is still working.  We know it is difficult to pass pension reform. It is clear there is no climate for that now,  said Lucio Vieira Lima, the deputy leader of the ruling PMDB party in the lower chamber of Congress.  The tax measure will be sent to Congress after the two-week recess that began on Tuesday, the aide said.  It will not tackle the more complicated levies in Brazil's burdensome tax system, the ICMS tax on circulation of goods and the ISS tax on services. These are vital sources of revenue for cash-strapped local governments and any attempt to change them could be political dynamite for Temer at this moment.

AMC's shares dived over 10 percent on Monday after sources said regulators in China had told banks to stop providing funding for several of Dalian Wanda's overseas acquisitions amid broader curbs on companies moving funds overseas. The curbs on Wanda, announced at a meeting in June, focused on six overseas deals, four of which have already been completed, an internal bank document seen by Reuters showed. AMC said deals for Starplex Cinemas, Odeon & UCI Cinemas, Nordic Cinema Group and Carmike Cinemas Inc completed between 2015 and earlier this year were fully funded by the firm's own funds and loans from U.S.-based banks.  At no time was Wanda ever a source of funding for any of these acquisitions or individual theatre purchases,  AMC said in a statement. Wanda bought AMC for $2.6 billion in 2012, part of a broader push by the Chinese company firm into cinemas. The cinema chain added it had also never  never received committed financing from any bank headquartered in mainland China for any purpose, including for acquisitions . The most recent four deals were funded by loans from syndicates of U.S. banks taken out by AMC and from AMC's own cash reserves. Beijing is on a major drive to control risks in its financial system, including firms taking on excessive levels of debt to fund overseas deals. Chinese authorities clamped down on capital outflows and overseas acquisitions last year. Rooted in property, Wanda is one of a handful of Chinese conglomerates that have expanded aggressively abroad over the past few years, into areas beyond their original business. It is controlled by one of China's richest men, Wang Jianlin. AMC's chief executive Adam Aron said in the statement that Wanda  does not actively participate in the day-to-day running of AMC  beyond its three seats on the company's board.  AMC is an American company run from its Leawood, Kansas, headquarters by our management teams located in the U.S. and Europe,  he said. AMC is the top cinema chain in the United States, and has around 1,000 theatres around the world.

Last year's vote to leave the EU has highlighted tensions among the United Kingdom's four constituent nations: England and Wales voted to leave, Scotland and Northern Ireland to remain.  It has prompted renewed calls from Scottish nationalists for a vote on independence, and members of the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish governments have complained the national government has not involved them enough its Brexit negotiation preparations.  Brexit's impact on the future of the United Kingdom will be profound and unpredictable. At the moment, the internal politics are pretty toxic,  said Michael Jay, a member of the Lords EU committee and former head of Britain's diplomatic service. The committee's report  Brexit: devolution , said the supremacy of EU law and its interpretation by the EU's Court of Justice have helped ensure consistency of legal and regulatory standards across the United Kingdom's internal market.  Brexit thus presents fundamental constitutional challenges to the United Kingdom as a whole,  the report said. It called on the government to set aside party politics and adjust its Brexit approach to accommodate the needs of the different regions. It also said Brexit would lead to a significant increase in powers and responsibilities for local institutions in the three devolved nations, in areas such as fisheries and agriculture. Any attempt at a  power grab  by either side would only add to instability, it said.    Scotland's governing Scottish National Party has threatened to try to block the progress of key legislation that will sever legal ties with the EU unless the government does more to account for Scotland's interests in Brexit. The Lords' report said that if the UK-wide Brexit agreement does not adequately reflect Scotland's needs, a strong political and economic case can be made for making differentiated arrangements for Scotland.  The UK Government must respect the devolved institutions. It's not enough saying it's listening to them, it's actually got to take account of what they say and adjust its approach to accommodate their specific needs,  Jay said.  Equally, the devolved administrations must work with, not against, the UK government to get the best Brexit for the whole of the UK.

Reuters had reported the pricing earlier in the day citing sources familiar with the matter.  Carrefour Brasil, a unit of France's Carrefour SA (CARR.PA) and Brazil's largest supermarket chain, and shareholders secured 5.12 billion reais ($1.6 billion) with the transaction.   Carrefour Brasil sold 91.2 million shares in so-called secondary offering, in which current shareholders sell part of their stakes, and 205.8 million shares in primary offering, in which the proceeds go to the company's coffers. At 15 reais per shares, Carrefour Brasil will trade at a discount against rival GPA SA (PCAR4.SA) in terms of enterprise value over earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, a metric known as EV/EBITDA. Other multiples, such as sales over EBITDA, yield a premium for Carrefour Brazil. Investors were reluctant to bid at the top half of the 15-19 reais suggested range for a company that lacks a substantial competitive advantage, fund managers said. Still, the IPO should help Carrefour Brasil add muscle to take on GPA, whose food division has recovered amid slowing appliance sales. Carrefour recently surpassed GPA as Brazil's No. 1 diversified retailer in sales.

Fidelity disclosed this week, for example, how content-sharing company Pinterest Inc had an outsize impact on the portfolio performance of Contrafund, its most popular stock fund. It was one of the first times a company that had not yet done an initial public offering (IPO) made a Fidelity fund's quarterly list of largest contributors and detractors to benchmark performance, Fidelity spokeswoman Nicole Goodnow said. Pre-IPO investments can amplify a fund's relative performance because they are not included in a comparison benchmark index. And the valuations attached to them by Fidelity and other mutual fund companies have far outpaced the stock market. Fidelity's $114 billion Contrafund disclosed that its small stake in Pinterest shaved 9 basis points off the fund's relative return versus the S&P; 500 Index. Contrafund's Series E stake in Pinterest was valued at $473.3 million in the first quarter. But at the end of May, that value was marked down by 17 percent, Fidelity disclosures showed.  But Pinterest was tied with TJX Companies Inc as Contrafund's largest detractor in the second quarter, even though the pre-IPO company accounted for only 0.34 percent of the fund's net assets.  Contrafund, which is run by star Fidelity portfolio manager Will Danoff, posted a total second-quarter return of 6.09 percent in the second quarter, easily beating the 3.09 percent total return on the S&P; 500 Index. The fund's year-to-date return of 19.84 percent is better than 75 percent of U.S. large-cap growth mutual funds, according to Morningstar Inc data. Fidelity's valuation of Contrafund’s Series E stake in Pinterest has more than doubled since an initial investment of $159.4 million in October 2013, compared to Nasdaq's 62 percent rise. While Pinterest is a relative pipsqueak in the massive Contrafund portfolio, other Fidelity managers have made tech unicorns some of their largest holdings.  At the end of May, ride-hailing company Uber was a top 20  stock in Fidelity's $22 billion Blue Chip Growth Fund. The fund's Series D stake in Uber was valued at $251.5 million, or 1.14 percent of net assets. Portfolio manager Sonu Kalra's Uber stake is bigger than his bet on Starbucks Corp ($202 million) and Bank of America Corp ($157 million).  In the first quarter, Uber was among the fund's largest detractors, shaving 12 basis points off the fund's relative return. Only Qualcomm Inc and Lululemon Athletica Inc detracted more.

Reuters had reported the pricing earlier in the day citing sources familiar with the matter.  Carrefour Brasil, a unit of France's Carrefour SA (CARR.PA) and Brazil's largest supermarket chain, and shareholders secured 5.12 billion reais ($1.6 billion) with the transaction.   Carrefour Brasil sold 91.2 million shares in so-called secondary offering, in which current shareholders sell part of their stakes, and 205.8 million shares in primary offering, in which the proceeds go to the company's coffers. At 15 reais per shares, Carrefour Brasil will trade at a discount against rival GPA SA (PCAR4.SA) in terms of enterprise value over earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, a metric known as EV/EBITDA. Other multiples, such as sales over EBITDA, yield a premium for Carrefour Brazil. Investors were reluctant to bid at the top half of the 15-19 reais suggested range for a company that lacks a substantial competitive advantage, fund managers said. Still, the IPO should help Carrefour Brasil add muscle to take on GPA, whose food division has recovered amid slowing appliance sales. Carrefour recently surpassed GPA as Brazil's No. 1 diversified retailer in sales.

The  Rebel Heart  singer filed a request in New York Supreme Court for a temporary restraining order against New York auction house Gotta Have It Collectibles to halt the sale, due to start on Wednesday. Madonna said in court documents that she was not aware until reading press reports that many of the items listed for auction, including the letter from her former boyfriend Shakur, were no longer in her possession. The items were consigned to auction by Darlene Lutz, whom Madonna described in court documents as a former friend and art consultant and said she had  betrayed my trust in an outrageous effort to obtain my possessions without my knowledge or consent.  A representative for the auction house and Lutz said in an emailed statement that Madonna's effort to stop the sale was  a completely baseless and meritless action,  and they would challenge her claims in court. “We believe that her intent is nothing more than to besmirch the good reputations of the auction house and Ms Lutz,  the statement said. In a letter dated January 1995 and written to Madonna by Shakur while he was in prison for sexual assault, the rapper said he ended their romance because he felt that dating a white woman could jeopardize his career.  I felt due to my 'image' I would be letting down half of the people who made me what I thought I was. I never meant to hurt you,  he said. Shakur was killed at age 25 in a drive-by shooting in Las Vegas in September 1996. Also among the 20 items Madonna is seeking to remove from sale are a pair of her panties, an old checkbook, a hairbrush and personal photos. In another letter from the early 1990s, Madonna voiced her frustration at not having a music career like Houston or film career like Stone.  Not because I want to be these women - because I'd rather die, but they're so horribly mediocre and they're always being held up as paragons of virtue (or) some sort of measuring stick to humiliate me,  she said in the letter. Houston drowned in a Beverly Hills hotel bathtub in 2012. Stone said in a Facebook post last week that she is friends with Madonna, adding:  I love and adore you; won't be pitted against you by any invasion of our personal journeys.

The proposed spinoff, which would be called BP Midstream Partners, revives a plan first broached internally about five years ago before slumping crude oil prices caused the company to put the idea on hold, a person familiar with the proposal said.  BP's plan would spin off crude oil, natural gas and fuel pipelines in a master-limited partnership (MLP), a tax-advantaged structure often used by pipeline and other capital intensive companies. If it decides to go ahead with the idea, BP said it would register the subsidiary by year-end.  The company and its underwriters have retained advisors to explore the sale, the source said.  A spinoff likely would be one of the larger initial public offerings of the year, the person said, speaking on the condition of anonymity as the talks were private.  BP did not comment on the details or potential valuation of a possible transaction beyond the press release. It would own the MLP's general partner and receive all of its distribution rights, the statement said.   Several other energy companies have spun off their pipeline assets to generate capital. They include rival Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSa.L), which in 2014 raised nearly $1 billion in the largest MLP IPO to date, along with refiners like Valero Energy Corp (VLO.N), Tesoro Corp (TSO.N), and Marathon Petroleum Corp (MPC.N). Shell was the first oil major to use this structure to generate cash from its assets. Shell's partnership has a market value of about $5.38 billion. BP's pipeline network is slightly smaller than Shell's.  Previous efforts by BP to sell pipeline assets have not materialized. Last year, BP approached Enbridge Inc (ENB.TO) to sell some of BP's offshore Gulf of Mexico pipeline network, but the deal fell through, according to a person familiar with that transaction.  BP's U.S. pipeline business includes a network of 3,500 miles (5,633 kilometers) of pipelines and terminal facilities that transport and store more than 1.3 million barrels per day of oil, refined products and natural gas. In addition to the Gulf Coast and Midwest assets, BP operates pipelines in the Pacific Northwest.  Under U.S. tax codes, MLPs are partnerships that do not pay corporate income tax on distributions, or earnings, to partners. The partners, or owners, are responsible for paying taxes on the distributions.  BP's potential IPO of its midstream assets comes at a rough time for the U.S. pipeline sector.  While pipeline operators derive profit from long-term contracts not linked to commodity price gyrations, the dip in oil prices in recent years has nonetheless weighed on the sector, said Tamar Essner, director of energy and utilities at Nasdaq Corporate Solutions.   There's this perception in the market that the midstream sector is meant to be insulated from the volatility of the commodity price movement,  said Essner.  But retail investors have gotten spooked by oil markets.  The price of crude oil has fallen sharply in recent months, with oil overall down nearly 14 percent this year. The Alerian MLP exchange-traded fund (AMLP.K), which tracks the performance of more than two dozen midstream companies, has lost more than 4 percent in 2017, according to Thomson Reuters data. Tuesday's announcement came after the market closed. BP is worth 88 billion GBP ($114.8 billion) and its shares closed on Tuesday in London at 445.80 GBP a share.  BP is still paying down costs from the deadly 2010 Deepwater Horizon rig explosion at its Macondo well in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. The company is set to pay up to $5.5 billion in cash payments to U.S. authorities this year as part of one settlement. BP has sharply reduced its capital spending over the past three years in the face of a drop in oil prices, but it still requires an oil price of around $60 a barrel in order to cover its costs, dividends and penalties. The lesson for BP from Shell's experience is a master limited partnership drawing on existing assets can allow it to get cash and continuing income from its capital-intensive operations while still working closely with the asset owners.   We prioritize our assets and maintain strategic control,  said John Hollowell, chief executive of Shell Midstream Partners in an interview last month referring only to Shell's decision-making.  The key part for us is allows to have the best of both worlds. We can monetize and maintain control of the asset.

The lesson for BP from Shell's experience is a master limited partnership drawing on existing assets can allow it to get cash and continuing income from its capital-intensive operations while still working closely with the asset owners.   We prioritize our assets and maintain strategic control,  said John Hollowell, chief executive of Shell Midstream Partners in an interview last month referring only to Shell's decision-making.  The key part for us is allows to have the best of both worlds. We can monetize and maintain control of the asset.

The cow tested positive for the atypical L-type of BSE after exhibiting clinical signs at an Alabama livestock market, the USDA said in a press release. Atypical BSE can arise spontaneously in cattle herds, usually in animals 8 years old or older.   This animal never entered slaughter channels and at no time presented a risk to the food supply, or to human health in the United States,  the USDA said.  Following delivery to the livestock market the cow later died at that location.  The Alabama cow is the fifth detection of BSE in the United States, four of which were atypical.   This finding of an atypical case will not change the negligible risk status of the United States, and should not lead to any trade issues,  the USDA added. The only classical BSE case was an animal found in 2003 at a Washington farm that was imported from Canada and born before a 1997 ban on the use of cattle feed containing brain or spinal tissue, which can result in transmission of the disease. China last month resumed imports of U.S. beef for the first time since banning them following the 2003 scare. First detected in Britain in the 1980s, classical mad cow ravaged herds in parts of Europe until the early 2000s and was linked to the brain-wasting Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans.

The No. 3 U.S. airline by passenger traffic outperformed analysts' expectations on key financial metrics, posting adjusted earnings per share of $2.75, versus analysts' consensus forecast of $2.67. Excluding special charges, United posted net income of $846 million and a pretax margin of 13.2 percent. The solid financial results for the period ended on June 30 came despite consumer outrage over an April incident in which a paying passenger was dragged off a United flight. The company eventually settled with the passenger for an undisclosed amount and promised changes to company policy in hopes of winning back goodwill. In the second-quarter report, United posted a 79 percent decline in the number of passengers involuntarily denied boarding in May and an 88 percent drop in June, following the uproar over the dragged passenger. The airline performed better than expected on revenue, pulling in $10 billion, up 6.4 percent year over year, versus analysts' consensus of $9.97 billion. Despite gains in several measures, United shares fell in after-hours trading as much as 3.5 percent. Airline shares were down industry-wide at market close.  United also said on Tuesday it would delay taking four Airbus A350 jets from 2018 and it would accelerate its order of 12 Boeing 737 Max aircraft into 2019 and two Boeing 787-10 aircraft within 2019.  United's deferral of the four A350s marks another blow for the Airbus (AIR.PA) jetliner designed to challenge Boeing's carbon-fiber composite 787 Dreamliner. It comes after Qatar Airways canceled four A350 orders earlier this month, citing delivery delays. Delta Air Lines Inc (DAL.N) said in May it would put off taking delivery of 10 A350s.  Despite its deferrals, Delta still took delivery of its first A350 earlier this month, and it will be the first North American airline to operate the new jet later this year. The A350 will mainly fly on routes between the United States and Asia, replacing older Boeing 747 aircraft, Delta said.     The Qatar Airways decision meant Airbus would need to resell or reallocate the 283-seat jets at a time when demand for big planes is weak.

The so-called “non-assert” clause had been a point of friction for years for numerous companies that were interested in using Amazon Web Services but were reluctant to trust Amazon with their intellectual property.  Amazon Web Services, a cloud computing pioneer, now provides computing and data storage services for a wide variety of customers. It faces growing competition from others including Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O). The decision to remove the clause makes Amazon “appear more user friendly, and it smoothes over a major objection point corporate counsel have been raising,” said Phil Davis, CEO of PhilStockWorld.com, an investment advisory service. Amazon has also introduced a new policy that will protect customers if they are sued for patent infringement over services that run on Amazon Web Services. Microsoft has offered a policy with similar protections since February. Calvin French-Owen, co-founder and CTO of Segment, a customer data management startup in San Francisco that has been an Amazon Web Services customer since May 2011, praised the moves. “It’s cool that they are willing to defend companies on their platform against patent trolls,” he said.

The No. 3 U.S. airline by passenger traffic outperformed analysts' expectations on key financial metrics, posting adjusted earnings per share of $2.75, versus analysts' consensus forecast of $2.67. Excluding special charges, United posted net income of $846 million and a pretax margin of 13.2 percent. The solid financial results for the period ended on June 30 came despite consumer outrage over an April incident in which a paying passenger was dragged off a United flight. The company eventually settled with the passenger for an undisclosed amount and promised changes to company policy in hopes of winning back goodwill. In the second-quarter report, United posted a 79 percent decline in the number of passengers involuntarily denied boarding in May and an 88 percent drop in June, following the uproar over the dragged passenger. The airline performed better than expected on revenue, pulling in $10 billion, up 6.4 percent year over year, versus analysts' consensus of $9.97 billion. Despite gains in several measures, United shares fell in after-hours trading as much as 3.5 percent. Airline shares were down industry-wide at market close.  United also said on Tuesday it would delay taking four Airbus A350 jets from 2018 and it would accelerate its order of 12 Boeing 737 Max aircraft into 2019 and two Boeing 787-10 aircraft within 2019.  United's deferral of the four A350s marks another blow for the Airbus (AIR.PA) jetliner designed to challenge Boeing's carbon-fiber composite 787 Dreamliner. It comes after Qatar Airways canceled four A350 orders earlier this month, citing delivery delays. Delta Air Lines Inc (DAL.N) said in May it would put off taking delivery of 10 A350s.  Despite its deferrals, Delta still took delivery of its first A350 earlier this month, and it will be the first North American airline to operate the new jet later this year. The A350 will mainly fly on routes between the United States and Asia, replacing older Boeing 747 aircraft, Delta said.     The Qatar Airways decision meant Airbus would need to resell or reallocate the 283-seat jets at a time when demand for big planes is weak.

The so-called “non-assert” clause had been a point of friction for years for numerous companies that were interested in using Amazon Web Services but were reluctant to trust Amazon with their intellectual property.  Amazon Web Services, a cloud computing pioneer, now provides computing and data storage services for a wide variety of customers. It faces growing competition from others including Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O). The decision to remove the clause makes Amazon “appear more user friendly, and it smoothes over a major objection point corporate counsel have been raising,” said Phil Davis, CEO of PhilStockWorld.com, an investment advisory service. Amazon has also introduced a new policy that will protect customers if they are sued for patent infringement over services that run on Amazon Web Services. Microsoft has offered a policy with similar protections since February. Calvin French-Owen, co-founder and CTO of Segment, a customer data management startup in San Francisco that has been an Amazon Web Services customer since May 2011, praised the moves. “It’s cool that they are willing to defend companies on their platform against patent trolls,” he said.

Small-cell towers are increasingly in demand by wireless carriers as they try to boost coverage and increase capacity, especially in urban areas. Reuters reported last week that Crown Castle had made an offer for Lightower. Crown Castle said it expects the deal to add about $465 million to $485 million to adjusted funds from operations  before financing costs in the first full year of ownership and boost its annual dividend of $3.80 by 15 cents to 20 cents per share.  The company also said it expected Lightower to contribute $850 million to $870 million in site rental revenue.

Republican senators' effort to pass their own healthcare overhaul bill collapsed late on Monday, stoking doubts over the likelihood that Trump's pro-growth agenda would come to fruition. Traders also remained doubtful the Federal Reserve would be able to raise interest rates again this year, while other central banks including the European Central Bank and Bank of England have signaled a more hawkish bent toward tightening policy.   The setback for Trump is a setback for the U.S. dollar,  said Kathy Lien, managing director at BK Asset Management in New York.  Based upon the failed repeal of Obamacare, I think that really casts doubt on the Trump administration's broader strategies.  The euro touched $1.1583 EUR= against the dollar, its strongest since early May 2016, with analysts noting traders who had  shorted  or bet against the euro were being forced to  cover  or repurchase the currency.  A U.S. Dollar note is seen in this June 22, 2017 illustration photo.Thomas White/IllustrationThe euro's 0.7 percent increase, as of afternoon U.S. trading, last put it on course for its biggest one-day percentage gain in three weeks.   The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, touched its lowest level since early September 2016 of 94.476 .DXY.  An illustration picture shows euro coins, April 8, 2017.Kai PfaffenbachThe dollar touched 0.9525 franc CHF=, its lowest against the Swiss currency since late June 2016, while the dollar hit a three-week low against the Japanese yen of 111.69 yen JPY=.  The dollar index has fallen 7.4 percent since the start of the year, partly on the doubts over Trump's fiscal stimulus agenda, with much of the downdraft starting in early March. The Australian dollar was a beneficiary of the greenback's weakness on Tuesday and surged to a more than two-year high of $0.7942 AUD=D4.   This is a tremendous short squeeze in the euro on the break of $1.15, and that has resulted in a significant rally as shorts bail out of their positions,  said Douglas Borthwick, managing director at Chapdelaine Foreign Exchange in New York. Friday's weak reading on U.S. inflation and retail sales fanned speculation the Fed may not have justification for another rate hike by the end of this year, despite policymakers' projection for such a move.

It would send a very strong message to the market.  Several Republican senators were quick to deride the payments.  Those who will be interested in moving an insurance bailout later this year should be ready to explain how they want to pay for it,  said Republican Senator Orrin Hatch, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee.

Correa suffered the injury during Monday's game against the Seattle Mariners when he jammed the thumb on a swing. A re-examination on Tuesday diagnosed the severity of the injury. Correa told reporters he underwent an MRI exam and will undergo surgery on a yet to be determined date.  At this point of the season you don't want to get hurt, you want to keep playing,  Correa told reporters on Tuesday.  It has been a fun season so far for this team.  The Astros own the second-best record (62-31) in Major League Baseball but will surely miss their 22-year-old star, who is batting .320 with 20 homers and 67 RBIs.  Losing a player of Carlos' caliber for an extended period is a big blow to our club, but I believe we have the roster to persevere and continue to win games,  general manager Jeff Luhnow said in a statement.  We do expect Carlos to return to the club in September and be ready to contribute down the stretch.  Correa has hit 20 homers in each of his three big-league seasons and was American League Rookie of the Year in 2015. Houston recalled infielder Colin Moran to fill the roster spot. Moran is batting .308 with 18 homers and 63 RBIs for Triple-A Fresno. The left-handed hitting Moran played in nine games for the Astros last season and went 3-for-23.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-baseball-mlb-hou-correa-idUSKBN1A32HL"},

The U.S. dollar index .DXY that tracks the greenback's strength against major currencies slid to an 10-month low in the wake of setback to President Trump's agenda.   And with the euro and yen both gaining on the possibility that the European Central Bank and Bank of Japan will raise interest rates later this year as their economies improve, the dollar's decline of the past five months may well continue.  The prospects for the dollar have turned bearish for the rest of year,  said Minh Trang, senior currency trader at Silicon Valley Bank in Santa Clara, California.  A Reuters poll published earlier in July showed a majority of foreign exchange strategists polled by Reuters less bullish on the greenback than at the start of the year. Trump Trade Tarnished After the U.S. elections last November, Wall Street stocks and the dollar gained and bond yields rose on hopes that, with the Republican party controlling both the White House and Congress for the first time since 2006, the new administration would quickly enact big tax cuts and spend on bridges and roads, driving faster economic growth and inflation.   The so-called  Trump trade  has steadily eroded though in the first half of the year as infighting in the Republican party stalled the promised reforms, and the collapse of the latest effort to reform healthcare on Tuesday only served to accelerate the dollar's selloff. “It pushes out the rest of the agenda. It’s hard to do a tax reform in the style that it was campaigned on. The healthcare hurdle pushes everything in Trump’s agenda to 2018,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities in New York. As a result, the U.S. dollar index .DXY, which tracks the greenback against six major currencies, has fallen 7.48 percent so far this year, making the fall for the year-to-date the biggest since 2002 when it shed 10.87 percent in the same period. Other indicators are also providing evidence of the market's increasing bearishness on the dollar.  Last week, speculators reduced their net long bets on the dollar to their lowest level since last May, according to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission data. Traders' three-month bearishness on the dollar versus the euro hit its most extreme since at least 2010 in late June before retreating a bit, Reuters data showed. EUR3MRR= A U.S. Dollar note is seen in this June 22, 2017 illustration photo.Thomas White/IllustrationEcb and Boj Also Pressure Usd However, prospects for U.S. economic reform are not the only factor seen pressuring the U.S. dollar later this year.  The euro EUR= began its latest leg up against the greenback four weeks ago after comments from European Central Bank President Mario Draghi highlighted the euro zone's economic recovery, stoking speculation the ECB may consider paring bond purchases later this year, pushing up euro bond yields and the single-currency. The euro has gained 10 percent versus the dollar year-to-date, rebounding from a cumulative 23.5 percent drop in the prior three years due to weak economic growth and the region's sovereign debt crisis, Reuters data showed.  On Tuesday, the euro EUR= climbed to its highest against the greenback since May 2016 after the U.S. Senate failed to bring the healthcare bill to a vote. The Japanese yen has also advanced against the dollar, gaining over 4.0 percent since January JPY=, after the Bank of Japan upgraded its economic outlook, increasing the prospects for paring monetary stimulus in the latter half of 2018. The greenback has also weakened against the Canadian dollar CAD=and the British pound GBP=.  The Canadian dollar hit a 15 month high against the U.S. dollar on Tuesday at C$1.2581, bringing its year-to-date gain to 6.0 percent CAD=D4 in the wake of the first interest rate rise in seven years by the Bank of Canada last week.  Years of ultra-low interest rates since the 2008 financial crisis had spurred a borrowing binge and helped drive Canadian household debt to record levels in recent years, fuelling a housing boom that has only recently begun to falter. And analysts forecast the Canadian central bank will raise rates again in October, according to a Reuters poll.  Last week, sterling GBP= also reached a 10-month high against the greenback as rising U.K inflation prompted comments from Bank of England officials suggesting interest rates may need to rise, despite slowing economic growth as Britain negotiates its exit from the European Union.  Clearly, anything that comes along at the moment just corroborates the market's negative attitude on the dollar,  said Neil Mellor, senior FX strategist with Bank of New York Mellon in London.  There's just not enough inflation at the moment. And anything like this (defeat for Trump) is liable to push it lower.

The Global Dairy Trade (GDT) Price Index edged up 0.2 percent, with an average selling price in the auction of $3,387 per tonne. The index had slipped 0.4 percent at the previous sale, moderating after a strong run earlier in the year. After two years of declining prices, farmers and analysts had been concerned that a 50 percent rebound during 2016 could be temporary, but prices got back on track in recent months as global supply tightened.  Dairy prices were largely unchanged overnight,  ASB said in a research note.  Butter prices set a fresh record high ... this is the tenth time that butter has set a new record high this year.  Gains were led by butter, which jumped 3.4 percent, while whole milk powder, the key export for New Zealand was up 0.3 percent. That was offset by a 3.2 percent fall in skim milk powder and a 1.8 percent decline in lactose. The auction results can affect the New Zealand dollar as the dairy sector generates more than 7 percent of the country's gross domestic product. The New Zealand dollar, however, was little changed on the day at $0.7345. GDT Events is owned by New Zealand's Fonterra Co-operative Group Ltd, the world's largest exporter of dairy, but operates independently from the company. U.S.-listed CRA International Inc is the trading manager for the twice-monthly Global Dairy Trade auction. A total of 26,688 tonnes was sold at the latest auction, falling 6.6 percent from the previous one. The auctions are held twice a month, with the next one scheduled for Aug. 1.

The mother, DiJanelle Fowler, kept the car running with the air conditioning on, but the car's battery died while she was inside the beauty shop in Tucker, Georgia, on June 15, said DeKalb County Police spokeswoman Shiera Campbell. Police believe Skylar Fowler was dead by the time her mother returned to the car a few hours later, Campbell said.  Instead of calling 911, she called roadside assistance to get her battery jumped,  Campbell said in a phone interview. Fowler concealed the baby from the person who helped restart her car, then went to a hospital and called 911, Campbell said.  The mother told police she herself had passed out from some sort of medical condition, Campbell said. But the child's condition indicated she had died sooner than the time Fowler suggested, the police spokeswoman said. The high temperature in DeKalb County that day was 92 degrees Fahrenheit at 5 p.m., according to the National Weather Service. Twenty-three U.S. children have died so far this year after being left in hot cars, up from 20 through mid-July in 2016, according to the nonprofit KidsAndCars.org, which tracks such deaths. In all, 39 children died in hot cars in 2016. The highest annual number was recorded in 2010, when 49 children died, said Janette Fennell, founder and president of the KidsAndCars.org. Children ages 3 and younger account for 87 percent of the hot-car deaths the group has tracked, she said.  Fowler left the Atlanta area after her daughter's death. She was arrested late on Monday after turning herself in to DeKalb County Police, who had been searching for her, Campbell said. In addition to the second-degree murder charge, she also is charged with second-degree cruelty to children and concealing a death, jail records show. Court records did not show whether Fowler had hired a lawyer.

The Culpeper County Sheriff's Office received an emergency call on Monday night reporting an assault at a residence in the area, roughly 75 miles (120 km) southwest of Washington, D.C. The suspect, Eric Clark, 43, had fled the residence and a description of his vehicle was broadcast by authorities, according to state police, who are investigating the shooting.   About an hour later, a sheriff's deputy saw a car matching the description near the small town of Culpeper and a car chase ensued after the driver ignored a deputy's attempt to pull him over, with two more deputies joining the pursuit, state police said. At least one deputy shot and killed Clark after stopping his car outside Culpeper, authorities said. State police said that Clark's shotgun was recovered at the scene, though it was unclear if he had turned the shotgun on the deputies.  The driver of the vehicle presented a deadly threat to the deputies and they responded by shooting and killing the driver,  the sheriff's office said in a statement.  Neither the sheriff's office nor state police said which of the deputies shot Clark or how many shots were fired. The deputies, who were not identified, are on modified duty until the probe has been completed, the sheriff's office said.  I'm so grateful that our deputies are safe. I'm deeply saddened by what they were forced to do and pray for comfort for everyone affected by this incident,  Sheriff Scott Jenkins said in a statement. Police shootings have become a highly charged issue in the United States, with killings of unarmed blacks leading to street protests nationwide.

By Timothy Gardner WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The growth of renewable power, including wind and solar, has not harmed the reliability of the U.S. electricity grid, according to a draft U.S. Department of Energy study, echoing the findings of grid operators across the country. The conclusion of the draft, dated July and viewed by Reuters, could ease fears in the renewable energy industry that the widely anticipated study would be used by President Donald Trump's administration to form policies supporting coal plants at the expense of wind and solar.  Numerous technical studies for most regions of the nation indicate that significantly higher levels of renewable energy can be integrated without any compromise of system reliability,  the draft says. It added that growth of renewables could require the building of more transmission lines, advanced planning, and more flexibility to balance generation and meet demand. But it said that baseload power - coal and nuclear power -  is not as necessary as it used to be  given advances in grid technology. Shaylyn Hynes, an Energy Department spokeswoman, said the draft was  outdated  and had not gone through  any adjudication  from career or political staff. The final report had been slated for release in early July, but is now expected within a couple of weeks, she said.   The draft can be seen at tmsnrt.rs/2v9PJ9l. Bloomberg first reported on it on Friday.              Energy Secretary Rick Perry had called in April for his department to examine whether regulations backing renewable energy use imposed by former president Barack Obama and other administrations  threaten to undercut the performance of the grid well into the future.   Critics of wind and solar energy have argued that those technologies leave the U.S. power system vulnerable to shortages when the sun is blocked or the wind does not blow - meaning that coal, nuclear, and natural gas plants that do not depend on weather should remain the bulk producers.  Solar electric panels are shown installed on the roof of the Hanover Olympic building, the first building to offer individual solar-powered net-zero apartments in Los Angeles, California, U.S., June 6, 2017.Mike BlakeRenewable energy is seen by many state and local government as a cost-effective way to reduce emissions linked to climate change. Nuclear energy is virtually emissions-free but poses potential safety risks and the thorny issue of disposing radioactive plant waste. Renewables and natural gas have displaced a slew of coal and nuclear plants in recent years, due to lower prices, environmental regulations and government subsidies. The draft said this is  not yet a problem for grid reliability and resilience - but further study is needed,  to determine how much of this  baseload  power can be lost while still ensuring reliability.  Grid Operators See No Threat  Officials at four grid operators, serving about 133 million customers, agreed renewables do not harm energy security or reliability.  I don't see them as threatening, no,  said Woody Rickerson, vice president of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas.  We can perform reliably with renewable generation; there are just things you have to do with renewables that you don't have to do with (conventional) power generation.   ERCOT said Texas got about 15 percent of its power from wind generation in 2016, and the region's solar power will grow quickly. Grid operators said that as renewables become more common they depend more on weather forecasting. Storm fronts and cloud covers sometimes require grid operators to ensure that conventional power is readily available as solar and wind power generation waxes and wanes.  Stu Bresler, senior vice president for operations at PJM Interconnection, which coordinates the movement of power in all or parts of 13 states from New Jersey to Tennessee, said renewables have not harmed reliability in his region. Steven Greenlee, senior spokesman at the California Independent System Operator, said on one day in May wind and solar served 67 percent of CALISO's demand.   We don't see the security at risk,  he said. Editing by Jonathan Oatis","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-energy-study-idUSKBN1A221U"},

The  Rebel Heart  singer filed a request in New York Supreme Court for a temporary restraining order against New York auction house Gotta Have It Collectibles to halt its sale, due to start on Wednesday. Madonna said in court documents that she was not aware until reading press reports that many of the items listed for auction, including the letter from her former boyfriend Shakur, were no longer in her possession. In the two-and-a-half-page letter, dated January 1995 and written at a time Shakur was in prison for sexual assault, he wrote that he had ended their romance because he felt that dating a white woman could jeopardize his career.  I felt due to my 'image' I would be letting down half of the people who made me what I thought I was. I never meant to hurt you,  Shakur wrote to Madonna. Shakur was only 25 when he was killed in a drive-by shooting in Las Vegas in September 1996. Also among the 20 items Madonna is seeking to remove from sale are a pair of her panties, an old checkbook, a hairbrush and personal photos. Gotta Have It Collectibles did not immediately return requests for comment. The items were consigned to auction by Darlene Lutz, a woman Madonna described in court documents as a former friend and art consultant, who she said had  betrayed my trust in an outrageous effort to obtain my possessions without my knowledge or consent.  In another letter up for auction, which was written in the early 1990s, Madonna wrote:  It's so unequivocally frustrating to read that Whitney Houston has the music career I wish I had and Sharon Stone has the film career I'll never have.   Not because I want to be these women - because I'd rather die, but they're so horribly mediocre and they're always being held up as paragons of virtue (or) some sort of measuring stick to humiliate me,  the letter added. Houston drowned in a Beverly Hills hotel bathtub in 2012. Stone in a Facebook post last week replied that she is a friend of Madonna, adding:  I love and adore you; won't be pitted against you by any invasion of our personal journeys.

By Timothy Gardner WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The growth of renewable power, including wind and solar, has not harmed the reliability of the U.S. electricity grid, according to a draft U.S. Department of Energy study, echoing the findings of grid operators across the country. The conclusion of the draft, dated July and viewed by Reuters, could ease fears in the renewable energy industry that the widely anticipated study would be used by President Donald Trump's administration to form policies supporting coal plants at the expense of wind and solar.  Numerous technical studies for most regions of the nation indicate that significantly higher levels of renewable energy can be integrated without any compromise of system reliability,  the draft says. It added that growth of renewables could require the building of more transmission lines, advanced planning, and more flexibility to balance generation and meet demand. But it said that baseload power - coal and nuclear power -  is not as necessary as it used to be  given advances in grid technology. Shaylyn Hynes, an Energy Department spokeswoman, said the draft was  outdated  and had not gone through  any adjudication  from career or political staff. The final report had been slated for release in early July, but is now expected within a couple of weeks, she said.   The draft can be seen at tmsnrt.rs/2v9PJ9l. Bloomberg first reported on it on Friday.              Energy Secretary Rick Perry had called in April for his department to examine whether regulations backing renewable energy use imposed by former president Barack Obama and other administrations  threaten to undercut the performance of the grid well into the future.   Critics of wind and solar energy have argued that those technologies leave the U.S. power system vulnerable to shortages when the sun is blocked or the wind does not blow - meaning that coal, nuclear, and natural gas plants that do not depend on weather should remain the bulk producers.  Solar electric panels are shown installed on the roof of the Hanover Olympic building, the first building to offer individual solar-powered net-zero apartments in Los Angeles, California, U.S., June 6, 2017.Mike BlakeRenewable energy is seen by many state and local government as a cost-effective way to reduce emissions linked to climate change. Nuclear energy is virtually emissions-free but poses potential safety risks and the thorny issue of disposing radioactive plant waste. Renewables and natural gas have displaced a slew of coal and nuclear plants in recent years, due to lower prices, environmental regulations and government subsidies. The draft said this is  not yet a problem for grid reliability and resilience - but further study is needed,  to determine how much of this  baseload  power can be lost while still ensuring reliability.  Grid Operators See No Threat  Officials at four grid operators, serving about 133 million customers, agreed renewables do not harm energy security or reliability.  I don't see them as threatening, no,  said Woody Rickerson, vice president of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas.  We can perform reliably with renewable generation; there are just things you have to do with renewables that you don't have to do with (conventional) power generation.   ERCOT said Texas got about 15 percent of its power from wind generation in 2016, and the region's solar power will grow quickly. Grid operators said that as renewables become more common they depend more on weather forecasting. Storm fronts and cloud covers sometimes require grid operators to ensure that conventional power is readily available as solar and wind power generation waxes and wanes.  Stu Bresler, senior vice president for operations at PJM Interconnection, which coordinates the movement of power in all or parts of 13 states from New Jersey to Tennessee, said renewables have not harmed reliability in his region. Steven Greenlee, senior spokesman at the California Independent System Operator, said on one day in May wind and solar served 67 percent of CALISO's demand.   We don't see the security at risk,  he said. Editing by Jonathan Oatis","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-energy-study-idUSL1N1K80X7"},

A senior Muslim cleric was also hurt, witnesses said. Slideshow (9 Images)Tensions have increased around the compound, which is holy to Muslims and Jews, since three Arab-Israeli gunmen shot dead two Israeli policemen outside the complex on Friday in one of the most serious attacks in the area in years. The assailants were killed by security forces and Israeli authorities briefly closed the compound. When it was reopened on Sunday, metal detectors had been installed, to the anger of Muslim religious authorities. Israeli officials said they were a permanent measure but many worshippers refused to go through them and preferred to pray outside the compound. The Palestinian Red Crescent ambulance service said at least 14 people had been injured in Tuesday's violence. A video clip posted on social media from the scene showed people running away from a melee and loud popping sounds. Israeli police spokeswoman Luba Samri said that, after prayers ended, some of the dozens of worshippers had started throwing rocks and bottles at police officers, and dispersal means were used. Two officers were lightly hurt, she said.

David Michael Ansberry, 65, pleaded guilty in U.S District Court in Denver to attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction in connection with the botched bombing of the Nederland, Colorado, police station, a spokesman for acting U.S. Attorney Robert Troyer said. The improvised explosive device failed to go off despite multiple attempts by Ansberry to detonate it with a cellphone, according to an FBI arrest warrant affidavit. According to a memorandum prosecutors filed before the  hearing, Ansberry belonged to a nomadic group of hippies called “Serenity, Tranquility and Peace,” or STP. The itinerant group had a presence in Nederland, a mountain community about 15 miles west of Boulder, in the late 1960s and early 1970s. One of STP’s members, Guy Goughnor, was slain there in the summer of 1971. “The Nederland town marshal, Renner Forbes, eventually confessed to killing Goughnor and was convicted for that crime in 1998,” federal prosecutors wrote in court documents. Forbes has since died. In October 2016, a Nederland police officer discovered the bomb in a backpack, prompting the evacuation of the police station and nearby buildings before explosives experts disarmed the device. Goughnor went by the nickname “Deputy Dawg” and a message was scrawled at the attempted bombing scene which read, “RIP Deputy Dawg and the date 7-17-71,” prosecutors said. Authorities said Ansberry had harbored a grudge for more than four decades and traveled from California to Idaho, where he purchased bomb making components before arriving in Colorado. Detectives were led to Ansberry after tracing the purchase of cellphones to a Colorado grocery store where security cameras captured images of Ansberry. He was easily identified by his diminutive 3-foot, 6-inch stature. Federal agents arrested Ansberry at Midway Airport in Chicago as he was preparing to catch a flight to Baltimore, and returned him to Colorado. Ansberry’s public defenders did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment, but the Denver Post reported that during Tuesday’s hearing, Ansberry said he pleaded guilty to avoid additional charges.  He faces up to life in prison and a maximum $250,000 fine when he is sentenced in November.

SLS Management LLC said Abercrombie was not being  aggressive enough  in efforts to turn itself around amid falling sales at most of its brands. SLS owned 0.84 percent of Abercrombie's shares outstanding as of March 31, according to Thomson Reuters data. New Albany, Ohio-based Abercrombie operates around 700 stores in the United States and nearly 200 outside the country. SLS, in a letter to the company's board, laid out two ways for Abercrombie to buy back shares. The retailer could buy back $200 million of stock while cutting its annual dividend to 18 cents from the current 80 cents, SLS said. Alternatively, Abercrombie could sell its real estate assets that make up a  substantial portion  of its market value and use the proceeds from the sale to buy back shares, the investor added.  A repurchase of almost 30 percent of Abercrombie's shares would be an important illustration of management's confidence in the turnaround and the attractiveness of the stock at current prices,  SLS said. Abercrombie last week ended talks over a potential sale, dealing another blow to the retail sector that has struggled to cope with low mall traffic and changing consumer tastes. Retailers including Aeropostale, Wet Seal and BCBG Max Azria Group LLC have filed for bankruptcy over the past two years. Shares of Abercrombie were up 2.3 percent at $9.49 in after-market trading. The stock had fallen nearly 23 percent this year through Tuesday.

The proposals include substantial weakening of the Dodd-Frank financial-reform law. At the same time, White House appointments to several bank regulatory agencies are likely to promote measures that result in reductions in bank compliance costs, capital requirements and liquidity constraints. Right now, consideration is also being given in the euro zone to ease regulatory requirements on banks to promote more lending and add stimulus to the economy. And, in the UK, measures are also likely to lighten the regulatory burdens to incentivize banks in the City to stay in a post-Brexit Britain. The moves toward a new era of relaxed regulation and supervision make it all the more necessary that still greater attention be given to the important issues of banking culture and conduct. It is a decade since the financial crisis started, and public confidence in the system remains low because some large banks continue to behave improperly. A number of banks still put short-term profit maximization ahead of serving their communities and customers. The Group of 30, an international group of public- and private-sector financial leaders, continues to monitor this situation, having published a major report two years ago that called for far-reaching reforms. The G30 has now decided to launch a further review later this year with the aim of publishing a new report in 2018. The G30’s report made comprehensive reform recommendations, but implementation by a number of financial institutions has been less than satisfactory. The UK decision to prosecute former senior executives of Barclays over alleged wrongdoing at the height of the financial crisis has again placed issues of banking integrity into the headlines. But new cases of wrongdoing abound, from recent major settlements agreed by Deutsche Bank to resolve misdeeds on both sides of the Atlantic, to the creation of fake consumer retail accounts at Wells Fargo. The financial costs are large. Boston Consulting Group has estimated that the banks have paid $321 billion in fines since the financial crisis for all manner of violations, including $42 billion alone in 2016. And the cost is still rising in 2017, with RBS being ordered to pay $5.5 billion for mis-selling most recently. Investors should view cultural failure as material to the profitability and long-term success and sustainability of the banks. As the wrongdoing continues and the fines rise, so it seems at times as if some bankers believe that the enormous settlements are just a cost of doing business. Bank employees and board directors who take this view should be replaced. I believe there are bankers who do not appreciate that cultural reform needs to be a continuous process, not a single destination at which point they can announce  job done.   There are also some senior bankers who make the right integrity statements in public, but their actions speak louder – especially when they appear to be more interested in their compensation. CEOs who constantly blame a few rogue employees every time another set of illegal or unethical actions is exposed are sending the wrong message. They need to take responsibility and place more importance on the culture and conduct of their institutions. And one crucial area that needs to be addressed is whistle-blowing. Employees who see abuse must be encouraged to believe that if they speak up they will be listened to, not victimized. They must be confident that their actions are treated confidentially, rather than fear management actions to unmask them. They can be a positive force for sound risk management, but if they believe both that they will be ignored and that they have reason to fear their supervisors, then, as happened at Wells Fargo, they will first inform the press or regulators. Only after the full scandal erupted did the Wells Fargo board acknowledge that top management was to blame for the extensive wrongdoing that damaged customer trust in the bank and, more generally, its overall reputation. A corporation’s culture is a unique blend of tradition, history and values – it cannot be imposed by laws and regulatory decrees. But regulators, by gathering experiences from many firms, can provide insights and exchange information on best practices in this area with boards of directors and senior managers – and they need to do more of this. The new U.S. Treasury report for financial deregulation contains a section on the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that was established under Dodd-Frank and that took the lead in the recent Wells Fargo case. The Treasury’s plans call for curbs on the CFPB’s powers, its reach and its independence. But there is not a single mention in the report of the importance of banking culture and conduct. Having worked in a major bank for my entire professional career I understand why so many bankers complain of regulatory overreach and are likely to welcome further deregulation. However, if banks do not address the deficits in reputational management and conduct, then there will be a future backlash – more regulation, more shareholder anger, and a further public decline in public confidence.BreakingviewsReuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

The settlement was announced as U.S. authorities fight a nationwide opioid epidemic, which has focused more attention on companies involved in distribution of prescription painkillers. Safeway, a division of Albertsons Companies Inc, accepted responsibility for failing to report the missing medications in a timely manner, according to the office of U.S. Attorney Annette Hayes in Seattle, which handled the case.  As our community struggles with an epidemic of opioid abuse, we call on all participants in drug distribution to carefully monitor their practices to stem the flow of narcotics to those who should not have them,  she said in a statement. Albertsons, one of the largest U.S. grocery chains, is backed by private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management LP . In a statement, Safeway said as part of the settlement, it will close a pharmacy at a store in Belmore, California, and will suspend filling prescriptions for controlled substances for four months at an in-store pharmacy in North Bend, Washington. Safeway said it  remains an active partner with the DEA, local law enforcement and the communities it serves in the fight against prescription drug abuse, including the abuse of opioids.  Opioids, including prescription painkillers and heroin, killed more than 33,000 people in the United States in 2015, more than any year on record, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The Justice Department said the probe began in 2014 after the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration found out Safeway pharmacies in North Bend, Washington, and Wasilla, Alaska, had failed to promptly report losing thousands of hydrocodone pills. The pharmacies reported the losses only months later after Safeway discovered that employees had pilfered the pills, the Justice Department said. Under federal law, pharmacies are required to notify the DEA of the discovery of a theft or significant loss of controlled substances within a single business day. The investigation widened to review practices at all Safeway pharmacies nationally from 2009 to 2014. The probe uncovered a widespread practice of pharmacies failing to promptly report missing or stolen drugs, the Justice Department said. In addition to paying $3 million, Safeway will also implement a compliance agreement reached with DEA to prevent future notification lapses.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/safeway-probe-idUSL1N1K921E"},

People with type 2 diabetes are twice as likely as people without diabetes to develop depression, which affects as many as a third of individuals 65 years and older. Variability in HbA1c has been associated with complications of diabetes, but there is little information about its relationship with depression, the study team writes in Diabetes Care. Ravona-Springer’s team analyzed about nine years’ worth of data on 837 people with type 2 diabetes whose average age was nearly 73 years. The information included around 18 HbA1c measurements over the years for each participant, and results from a depression assessment at the start of the study period. Average HbA1c was not associated with depressive symptoms, but the variability of HbA1c measurements was, such that each 1 percent increase in variability was associated with a 29 percent increase in the number of depressive symptoms, researchers found. The relationship between HbA1c variability was true regardless of HbA1c level, but it was strongest among people whose HbA1c was above 7 percent, a common target for blood sugar control.  The researchers admit that the results just show an association and don't necessarily mean that blood sugar variability causes symptoms of depression.  Nevertheless, they conclude that better long-term stability of HbA1c - in other words, more consistent blood sugar control - might help to prevent depression in elderly people with type 2 diabetes.  “This study is ongoing,” Ravona-Springer said. “We thus expect to have even better understanding of the directional relationships of glycemic control and other diabetes-related characteristics with depression as we start analyzing longitudinal data,” she said in an email.   The study hints at the importance of achieving stable A1c values at a certain age/point in a patient‘s diabetes history in contrast to trying to reduce A1c,” said Dr. Dominic Ehrmann from the Research Institute of the Diabetes Academy Mergentheim (FIDAM) in Bad Mergentheim, Germany, who has also studied the link between depression and diabetes.  “But (and this is a big but) this must be weighed against other clinical and medical objectives (e.g., complications, comorbidities, cognitive functioning),” he said by email.  “Depression/depressive symptoms should be an important factor in clinical decision making in elderly patients,” concluded Ehrmann, who wasn’t involved in the current study. “That is, the impact of therapy adjustments or changing treatment goals on depressive symptoms should be considered in clinical practice.”  SOURCE: bit.ly/2vfKCo6 Diabetes Care, online June 20, 2017.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-depression-diabetes-variabilit-idUSKBN1A32E4"},

While tech companies often lobby Washington on privacy issues, the major firms have been hesitant to enter a fray over a controversial portion of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), industry lobbyists, congressional aides and civil liberties advocates said.  Among their concerns is that doing so could jeopardize a trans-Atlantic data transfer pact underpinning billions of dollars in trade in digital services, the sources said. Technology companies and privacy groups have for years complained about the part of FISA known as Section 702 that allows the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) to collect and analyze emails and other digital communications of foreigners living overseas. Though targeted at foreigners, the surveillance also collects data on an unknown number of Americans - some privacy advocates have suggested it could be millions - without a search warrant. Section 702 will expire at the end of the year unless the Republican-controlled Congress votes to reauthorize it. The White House, U.S. intelligence agencies and many Republican senators want to renew the law, which they consider vital to national security, without changes and make it permanent. A coalition of Democrats and libertarian-leaning conservatives prefer, however, to amend the law with more privacy safeguards. Reform Government Surveillance, a coalition of tech firms established after the 2013 leaks by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, said reforming the law remains a priority. A spokeswoman declined to comment further but referred to two letters sent earlier this year by technology companies urging Congress to consider changes to the law. Snowden exposed the spy agency's program that collected U.S. phone call metadata in bulk and also the extent of spying under Section 702, embarrassing some U.S. technology firms. The companies, working with privacy rights activists, successfully lobbied Congress two years ago to pass legislation that curtailed the NSA's bulk collection of call records. For example, Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg wrote on his Facebook page that he had personally called then-President Barack Obama to express  frustration over the damage the government is creating for all of our future.  Now, however, Silicon Valley's reduced involvement frustrates civil liberties groups because of a widely held view that Section 702 poses a far greater threat to privacy than the telephone program, which did not harvest actual content. Facebook declined comment. Google and Apple did not respond to requests for comment. Privacy Shield Agreement The companies' relative inactivity is explained by several legal challenges in Europe to an agreement between the United States and the European Union, known as the Privacy Shield, the sources said. The litigation hinges on whether U.S. surveillance practices afford enough privacy safeguards. A coalition of human rights organizations has urged Europe to suspend Privacy Shield unless Section 702 is substantially reformed. U.S. technology companies have privately bristled at those efforts, three industry lobbyists said, in part because expectations that 702 reforms will pass Congress are low.  If you link them and you lose one, you lose both,  said one of the lobbyists, who like the others requested anonymity to discuss private conversations with technology companies.  The lobbyist added that several major firms were more interested in making deals with the Trump administration that could affect their bottom lines, such as tax repatriation, than getting caught in politically charged fights over government surveillance. Another industry lobbyist said Section 702 surveillance is  not a C-suite issue  that concerns chief executives in Silicon Valley like other issues, including encryption. Companies have also been limited in how they can lobby for changes to the law because no comprehensive reform bill has been introduced yet in Congress, said Alex Abdo, a privacy advocate and staff attorney at the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University.  A bipartisan group of lawmakers in the House Judiciary Committee is not expected to introduce such legislation until after Congress returns from its August recess. The schism between tech companies and privacy groups was on display earlier this year in litigation in Ireland - Facebook argued customer data was sufficiently protected from U.S. spying programs, while an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union testified that more protections were needed. Snowden's leaks showed that Section 702 collects content of digital communications directly from the internet backbone and through a program formerly code named Prism where the NSA gathered data directly from several companies, including Facebook, Google, Apple and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O). The statute also allows the FBI and others to query pools of data collection for U.S. information in what critics have derided as a  backdoor search loophole  that evades traditional warrant requirements.  The tech industry may become more engaged once the public debate becomes clearer, Abdo said. He added that a stronger position  would be enormously helpful to those that want to impose meaningful constraint on NSA surveillance.

The settlement was announced as U.S. authorities fight a nationwide opioid epidemic, which has focused more attention on companies involved in distribution of prescription painkillers. Safeway, a division of Albertsons Companies Inc, accepted responsibility for failing to report the missing medications in a timely manner, according to the office of U.S. Attorney Annette Hayes in Seattle, which handled the case.  As our community struggles with an epidemic of opioid abuse, we call on all participants in drug distribution to carefully monitor their practices to stem the flow of narcotics to those who should not have them,  she said in a statement. Albertsons, one of the largest U.S. grocery chains, is backed by private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management LP [CBS.UL]. In a statement, Safeway said as part of the settlement, it will close a pharmacy at a store in Belmore, California, and will suspend filling prescriptions for controlled substances for four months at an in-store pharmacy in North Bend, Washington. Safeway said it  remains an active partner with the DEA, local law enforcement and the communities it serves in the fight against prescription drug abuse, including the abuse of opioids.  Opioids, including prescription painkillers and heroin, killed more than 33,000 people in the United States in 2015, more than any year on record, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The Justice Department said the probe began in 2014 after the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration found out Safeway pharmacies in North Bend, Washington, and Wasilla, Alaska, had failed to promptly report losing thousands of hydrocodone  pills. The pharmacies reported the losses only months later after Safeway discovered that employees had pilfered the pills, the Justice Department said. Under federal law, pharmacies are required to notify the DEA of the discovery of a theft or significant loss of controlled substances within a single business day. The investigation widened to review practices at all Safeway pharmacies nationally from 2009 to 2014. The probe uncovered a widespread practice of pharmacies failing to promptly report missing or stolen drugs, the Justice Department said. In addition to paying $3 million, Safeway will also implement a compliance agreement reached with DEA to prevent future notification lapses.

While tech companies often lobby Washington on privacy issues, the major firms have been hesitant to enter a fray over a controversial portion of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), industry lobbyists, congressional aides and civil liberties advocates said.  Among their concerns is that doing so could jeopardize a trans-Atlantic data transfer pact underpinning billions of dollars in trade in digital services, the sources said. Technology companies and privacy groups have for years complained about the part of FISA known as Section 702 that allows the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) to collect and analyze emails and other digital communications of foreigners living overseas. Though targeted at foreigners, the surveillance also collects data on an unknown number of Americans - some privacy advocates have suggested it could be millions - without a search warrant. Section 702 will expire at the end of the year unless the Republican-controlled Congress votes to reauthorize it. The White House, U.S. intelligence agencies and many Republican senators want to renew the law, which they consider vital to national security, without changes and make it permanent. A coalition of Democrats and libertarian-leaning conservatives prefer, however, to amend the law with more privacy safeguards. Reform Government Surveillance, a coalition of tech firms established after the 2013 leaks by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, said reforming the law remains a priority. A spokeswoman declined to comment further but referred to two letters sent earlier this year by technology companies urging Congress to consider changes to the law. Snowden exposed the spy agency's program that collected U.S. phone call metadata in bulk and also the extent of spying under Section 702, embarrassing some U.S. technology firms. The companies, working with privacy rights activists, successfully lobbied Congress two years ago to pass legislation that curtailed the NSA's bulk collection of call records. For example, Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg wrote on his Facebook page that he had personally called then-President Barack Obama to express  frustration over the damage the government is creating for all of our future.  Now, however, Silicon Valley's reduced involvement frustrates civil liberties groups because of a widely held view that Section 702 poses a far greater threat to privacy than the telephone program, which did not harvest actual content. Facebook declined comment. Google and Apple did not respond to requests for comment. Privacy Shield Agreement The companies' relative inactivity is explained by several legal challenges in Europe to an agreement between the United States and the European Union, known as the Privacy Shield, the sources said. The litigation hinges on whether U.S. surveillance practices afford enough privacy safeguards. A coalition of human rights organizations has urged Europe to suspend Privacy Shield unless Section 702 is substantially reformed. U.S. technology companies have privately bristled at those efforts, three industry lobbyists said, in part because expectations that 702 reforms will pass Congress are low.  If you link them and you lose one, you lose both,  said one of the lobbyists, who like the others requested anonymity to discuss private conversations with technology companies.  The lobbyist added that several major firms were more interested in making deals with the Trump administration that could affect their bottom lines, such as tax repatriation, than getting caught in politically charged fights over government surveillance. Another industry lobbyist said Section 702 surveillance is  not a C-suite issue  that concerns chief executives in Silicon Valley like other issues, including encryption. Companies have also been limited in how they can lobby for changes to the law because no comprehensive reform bill has been introduced yet in Congress, said Alex Abdo, a privacy advocate and staff attorney at the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University.  A bipartisan group of lawmakers in the House Judiciary Committee is not expected to introduce such legislation until after Congress returns from its August recess. The schism between tech companies and privacy groups was on display earlier this year in litigation in Ireland - Facebook argued customer data was sufficiently protected from U.S. spying programs, while an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union testified that more protections were needed. Snowden's leaks showed that Section 702 collects content of digital communications directly from the internet backbone and through a program formerly code named Prism where the NSA gathered data directly from several companies, including Facebook, Google, Apple and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O). The statute also allows the FBI and others to query pools of data collection for U.S. information in what critics have derided as a  backdoor search loophole  that evades traditional warrant requirements.  The tech industry may become more engaged once the public debate becomes clearer, Abdo said. He added that a stronger position  would be enormously helpful to those that want to impose meaningful constraint on NSA surveillance.

(Reuters) - An Illinois teenager arrested for fatally stabbing an Uber [UBER.UL] driver may face additional criminal charges for her violent behavior while detained, prosecutors said on Tuesday.  Eliza Wasni, 16, who was charged in June with murdering Grant Nelson, has been involved in 40 reported incidents at the Chicago juvenile detention facility where she is being held, Diann Sheridan, a lawyer with the Cook County State's Attorney's Office, said during a court hearing. The incidents, including kicking and pushing detention center guards as well as one alleged instance of biting a guard, were acts of  destructive and potentially criminal behavior,  Sheridan said.  Wasni's public defender, David McMahon, said his client is faced with  excessive  restrictions while held in her cell.   She's doing her best at this point to comply,  he said.  Nelson, 34, was killed early on May 30 after picking up Wasni outside a Wal-Mart Stores Inc location in Skokie, Illinois, a northern suburb of Chicago.  Wasni, a high school student, pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder and other charges last week.  After shoplifting a machete and knife from the store, Wasni called an Uber and Nelson drove to pick her up, according to court documents. Two minutes into the ride, she attacked Nelson from behind, authorities said. Nelson was able to exit the car and made his way to a nearby condominium building where he called for help, local media reported. Nelson later died. Wasni fled in Nelson's car before crashing and fleeing on foot. She was then apprehended by police.  Judge Lauren Edidin said she had no jurisdiction over detention center rules but asked Wasni, who is being held without bail, to improve her behavior.  Wasni, who appeared at the Second Municipal District Skokie Courthouse wearing a brown sweatshirt and black sweatpants, responded that she would.  Sheridan told reporters the state has not yet succeeded in gaining access to Wasni's cell phone. Nelson's family has filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Wal-Mart seeking unspecified financial damages for failing to stop Wasni from stealing.  Wal-Mart has said it would respond  appropriately  with the court,  but we can say that we believe our associates acted properly, including alerting third-party security to a possible shoplifting incident.  Wasni's next court appearance is scheduled for Aug. 14.

The opinions expressed are his own.) China’s all-powerful rulers are taking arguably needed steps to guard against financial risks which is exactly why investors should give the country a wide berth. China shares on Tuesday extended a two-day selloff, with many shares falling by the 10 percent limit, after news from a Communist Party meeting of a renewed focus on regulation and deleveraging. The National Financial Work Conference, chaired by President Xi Jinping himself, on Saturday created a special committee to preside over regulation and the reduction of financial system debt over the next five years.  This was followed shortly by the China Banking Regulatory Commission announcing it will take firmer control over issues like credit provision, liquidity and off-books “shadow banking”. “To us, these announcements signal that lowering financial leverage and stabilizing corporate debt levels is a medium-term project that Chinese policymakers are keen to see through, but there is no rush to get it done this year,” Wei Yao, China economist at Societe Generale wrote in a note to clients. “Therefore, the authorities will probably keep the pressure on shadow lending, but will be careful in terms of limiting the damage to the real economy at the same time.” Careful the authorities may be, but damage they will do, and it will be felt keenly by equity investors, many of whom have been hoping to see higher prices driven by inflows of global capital after MSCI decided in late June to include China mainland shares in its benchmark indices. China's banks extended a record 12.65 trillion yuan in loans in 2016, responding to a government push for economic growth but credit and money expansion have since slowed rapidly, with broad money growth slowing in June to a record low of 9.4 percent. Total social financing plus bonds, the broadest measure of credit, grew at 14.7 percent in June compared to 15.3 percent in May. A slowing of credit growth is wise. There is good evidence that the quality of investment in projects and assets financed by credit has declined markedly in recent years and ultimately the model which helped China grow has been too reliant on fixed investment. Certainly an increased focus on stability and soundness beats the counterfactual alternative. Had Chinese authorities announced they were prioritizing economic growth and financial innovation, stocks might have soared but only because investors were betting the new money would find its way, as it so often does, into the hands of bigger fools than existing owners. Wide Berth Still, the order of business, in which the Party sent a signal and speculative shares tumbled, provides two excellent reasons why global investors should fight shy of China's shares, MSCI inclusion or not. The first is that a transition from credit-fueled growth of export-oriented production capacity to a more consumer-based economy will inevitably be bumpy. China has the world’s largest credit-to-GDP gap at 30 percent. Using this Bank for International Settlements measure, credit growth is too rapid credit and the efficiency of those projects and assets that the credit is funding is too low.  This implies distressed assets of more than $3 trillion, which, if credit is indeed rationed better, will have to be written off or marked down to more realistic prices.  Credit reckonings of that scale rarely, if ever, happen without very large collateral damage to investors, especially ones who are treated as capriciously as outsider capital often is in China. Even if China pulls of an immaculate deleveraging there will be pain for investors. That brings us to the second issue.  If your technology stock index is selling off by 5 or 10 percent because of something outwardly anodyne the government has said then you either have (a) too much speculation, (b) a too powerful government, or in China’s case both. And this is not just small tech stocks.  Shares in property company Sunac China Holdings fell as much as 13.5 percent on Tuesday after reports Chinese regulators told banks to stop providing funds for several overseas deals of Dalian Wanda including one in which Sunac plans to buy $9.3 billon of tourism and hotel assets.  This is being interpreted as part of an attempt to crack down on capital flight which may have been disguised by overseas takeovers, but that is not the point.  Dalian Wanda is controlled by China's second richest man. What is allowed today may not be tomorrow and no one is immune to changes in the prevailing winds. The point is that an investor in China takes on the huge political risk that their particular holdings will fall foul of the state. This is a risk almost impossible for insiders to mitigate, and arguably not what outsiders like global fund managers are good at or should be paid to run. The combination of deleveraging and political risk is too great. China is huge and ultimately most investors will be forced to hold substantial exposure to its $8 trillion equity market. One party power and risk isn’t going anywhere, but it may at least be wise to wait until the deleveraging has made more progress.

The Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P;/TSX composite index closed down 15.79 points, or 0.1 percent, at 15,149.57. It touched its lowest intraday since July 11 at 15,086.30. The collapse in the U.S. Senate of a key healthcare bill was a headwind.  It puts the fiscal policy agenda in jeopardy,  said Ben Jang, portfolio manager at Nicola Wealth Management.  The market isn't really pricing in any potential economic growth from Trump policy.  Canada sends most of its exports to the United States and could benefit from U.S. fiscal stimulus. Some of Canada's biggest banks were among the most influential losers on the index. Royal Bank of Canada fell 0.5 percent to C$94.68, while the overall financials group slipped 0.2 percent. The Bank of Canada last week raised interest rates for the first time in seven years. Investors worry that higher interest rates will add to a slowdown in Canada's real estate market and weigh on the country's economy. The impact will be broad-based because Canadians will spend less as the housing market slows, Jang said. The rise in rates has helped push the Canadian dollar to a 14-month high, which could hamper exporters. Industrials fell 0.4 percent, with Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd down nearly 1 percent at C$206.29. Shares of the railroad company, which will report earnings on Wednesday, have fallen more than 2 percent since the start of the week. The materials group, which includes precious and base metals miners and fertilizer companies, lost 0.2 percent, retreating after solid gains the day before. Just three of the index's 10 main groups ended higher. Energy rose 0.4 percent, boosted by higher oil prices. U.S. crude oil prices settled 0.8 percent higher at $46.40 a barrel as Saudi exports fell and solid demand soaked up some of what is seen as an oversupplied market. Canadian Natural Resources Ltd rose 1.2 percent to C$37.76, while Suncor Energy Inc gained 0.5 percent to C$37.57. Lending to Canadian small businesses picked up in May on stronger activity in the agriculture and consumer sectors, data showed, suggesting companies were becoming more willing to invest two years after a slump in oil prices hit the economy.

The protective caps known as telomeres shrink with age, and are also thought to erode with extreme stress. At age 9, kids who had lost a father had 14 percent shorter telomeres than children whose dad was still involved in their lives, researchers report in Pediatrics. Death had the biggest impact, and the association was stronger for boys than for girls.   While we know that disparate stressors - smoking, maltreatment, intense caregiving, etc - are associated with shorter telomeres, the biological link is not well established and is the subject of investigation in several labs,  said senior study author Dr. Daniel Notterman, a molecular biology researcher at Princeton University in New Jersey.  It is plausible to consider that children who have stress-induced telomere shortening may be at risk for future health problems, but many other factors play a role in a person's adult health and lifespan,  Notterman said by email.  The loss of a father is widely known to impair a child's physical and psychological functioning, and the connection between absent dads and health problems for kids is well documented, researchers note. However, less is known about the exact biological causes of medical issues kids with absent dads can encounter. Telomeres shorten each time a cell divides. Once telomeres are too short, cell growth stops, which is why their length is considered a potential indicator of cellular aging and overall health.  Some previous research has linked shorter telomeres to an increased risk of a variety of chronic health problems in adults, including heart disease and cancer.  For the current study, researchers examined data on family structure and tests of telomere length from saliva samples for 2,420 kids in 20 large American cities.  When a father died, children had 16 percent shorter telomeres than kids with a dad still in their life, the study found.  Losing a dad to incarceration was associated with 10 percent shorter telomeres, while a father absent because of separation or divorce was linked to 6 percent shorter telomeres.  The impact of missing fathers on telomere length didn't appear to differ by race or ethnicity. Boys with an absent dad, however, were more vulnerable to shorter telomeres than girls, particularly if boys lost their father before age 5, the study also found.  Researchers also looked at whether certain alleles, or versions of specific genes, might influence the odds of an absent dad being associated with shorter telomeres. Differences in gene variants related to levels of serotonin, a brain chemical responsible for mood, may partially explain why some kids with absent dads are more likely than others to have shorter telomeres, the researchers conclude.  The study wasn't a controlled experiment designed to prove whether or how absent dads directly contribute to shorter telomeres in kids or cause any specific health problems, the authors note. It's also possible that a variety of factors not examined in the study, such as mothers' parenting quality, might influence whether kids develop shorter telomeres after the loss of a father. Even so, since shorter telomeres are a marker of cellular aging, the study results suggest a biological link between early adversity and a risk for a range of chronic physical illnesses, said Dr. David Brent, chief of child and adolescent psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center.  This is important,” Brent said, because there is evidence that meditation can help buffer the effects of adversity. “So that for individuals with exposure to early adversity, such interventions could in theory actually prevent or attenuate chronic illnesses,  Brent, who wasn't involved in the study, said by email.  With death in particular, counseling both mothers and children can help prevent the loss of a father from impacting kids' health, Brent added. Previous research has shown just a dozen sessions focused on parenting skills and child coping can encourage better discipline practices and the open expression of grief.  There is evidence that strengthening families can buffer against the effects of the death of a parent,  Brent said.

The Republican push to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, widely known as Obamacare, collapsed in the Senate late on Monday after a tug-of-war between party moderates who wanted to preserve healthcare benefits for lower-income Americans and conservatives who wanted to scale them back. On Tuesday, House Republicans disagreed over the budget proposal in terms that could foreshadow a replay of the Senate healthcare debacle when lawmakers turn to tax reform. Representative Mark Meadows, chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, said the budget measure would not get enough conservative votes to pass the House without bigger cuts to programs that the government is required to fund by law.  It's still short of what it needs,  Meadows told reporters. On the other side, Representative Charlie Dent, a leader of the moderate Tuesday Group, called for an agreement with Democrats to establish higher spending levels for discretionary programs.  If we move too much in the mandatory area, then it will make tax reform that much more difficult to get. It's that basic,  Dent told Reuters. House and Senate approval for a fiscal 2018 budget agreement would unlock a vital legislative tool called reconciliation that allows Republicans to pass tax legislation in the Senate with a simple majority. But the Senate's inability to pass healthcare legislation   even with reconciliation raised questions about how useful the strategy really is.  One corporate lobbyist said some Senate Republicans privately question the reconciliation approach backed by House leaders, saying it appears to be  poisoning the well  in the Senate by alienating Democrats who might otherwise support tax legislation.  Republicans have only a 52-48 Senate majority and can afford to lose no more than two votes on Republican-only legislation, with Vice President Mike Pence providing the tie-breaking vote. Rep.

Pence, speaking to a gathering of retailers in Washington on Tuesday, reiterated that Trump plans to slash the corporate income tax rate to 15 percent from 35 percent. But the failure of the healthcare bill in the Senate created uncertainty in financial markets, with the dollar hitting its lowest level against the euro in more than a year on Tuesday.

The opinions expressed are his own.) China’s all-powerful rulers are taking arguably needed steps to guard against financial risks which is exactly why investors should give the country a wide berth. China shares on Tuesday extended a two-day selloff, with many shares falling by the 10 percent limit, after news from a Communist Party meeting of a renewed focus on regulation and deleveraging. The National Financial Work Conference, chaired by President Xi Jinping himself, on Saturday created a special committee to preside over regulation and the reduction of financial system debt over the next five years.  This was followed shortly by the China Banking Regulatory Commission announcing it will take firmer control over issues like credit provision, liquidity and off-books “shadow banking”. “To us, these announcements signal that lowering financial leverage and stabilizing corporate debt levels is a medium-term project that Chinese policymakers are keen to see through, but there is no rush to get it done this year,” Wei Yao, China economist at Societe Generale wrote in a note to clients. “Therefore, the authorities will probably keep the pressure on shadow lending, but will be careful in terms of limiting the damage to the real economy at the same time.” Careful the authorities may be, but damage they will do, and it will be felt keenly by equity investors, many of whom have been hoping to see higher prices driven by inflows of global capital after MSCI decided in late June to include China mainland shares in its benchmark indices. China's banks extended a record 12.65 trillion yuan in loans in 2016, responding to a government push for economic growth but credit and money expansion have since slowed rapidly, with broad money growth slowing in June to a record low of 9.4 percent. Total social financing plus bonds, the broadest measure of credit, grew at 14.7 percent in June compared to 15.3 percent in May. A slowing of credit growth is wise. There is good evidence that the quality of investment in projects and assets financed by credit has declined markedly in recent years and ultimately the model which helped China grow has been too reliant on fixed investment. Certainly an increased focus on stability and soundness beats the counterfactual alternative. Had Chinese authorities announced they were prioritizing economic growth and financial innovation, stocks might have soared but only because investors were betting the new money would find its way, as it so often does, into the hands of bigger fools than existing owners. Wide Berth Still, the order of business, in which the Party sent a signal and speculative shares tumbled, provides two excellent reasons why global investors should fight shy of China's shares, MSCI inclusion or not. The first is that a transition from credit-fueled growth of export-oriented production capacity to a more consumer-based economy will inevitably be bumpy. China has the world’s largest credit-to-GDP gap at 30 percent. Using this Bank for International Settlements measure, credit growth is too rapid credit and the efficiency of those projects and assets that the credit is funding is too low.  This implies distressed assets of more than $3 trillion, which, if credit is indeed rationed better, will have to be written off or marked down to more realistic prices.  Credit reckonings of that scale rarely, if ever, happen without very large collateral damage to investors, especially ones who are treated as capriciously as outsider capital often is in China. Even if China pulls of an immaculate deleveraging there will be pain for investors. That brings us to the second issue.  If your technology stock index is selling off by 5 or 10 percent because of something outwardly anodyne the government has said then you either have (a) too much speculation, (b) a too powerful government, or in China’s case both. And this is not just small tech stocks.  Shares in property company Sunac China Holdings fell as much as 13.5 percent on Tuesday after reports Chinese regulators told banks to stop providing funds for several overseas deals of Dalian Wanda including one in which Sunac plans to buy $9.3 billon of tourism and hotel assets.  This is being interpreted as part of an attempt to crack down on capital flight which may have been disguised by overseas takeovers, but that is not the point.  Dalian Wanda is controlled by China's second richest man. What is allowed today may not be tomorrow and no one is immune to changes in the prevailing winds. The point is that an investor in China takes on the huge political risk that their particular holdings will fall foul of the state. This is a risk almost impossible for insiders to mitigate, and arguably not what outsiders like global fund managers are good at or should be paid to run. The combination of deleveraging and political risk is too great. China is huge and ultimately most investors will be forced to hold substantial exposure to its $8 trillion equity market. One party power and risk isn’t going anywhere, but it may at least be wise to wait until the deleveraging has made more progress.

At 4 p.m. ET (2000 GMT), the Canadian dollar          was trading at C$1.2622 to the greenback, or 79.23 U.S. cents, up 0.6 percent.     Recent gains for the loonie came after the Bank of Canada raised interest rates last week for the first time since 2010 and signaled it would hike again over the coming months. The currency has gained roughly 7 percent since the central bank turned hawkish in June.     The currency traded between C$1.2581, its strongest level since early May 2016, and C$1.2702 during the session.      I think that (C$1.26) threshold may be acting as an opportunity to close out or at least take some profit on some short USD/CAD positions,  said Mazen Issa, senior FX strategist at TD Securities in New York, adding that the Canadian dollar could also be benefiting from a stronger Australian dollar, another commodities currency.     Australia's central bank economic outlook turned more upbeat, according to minutes from its July meeting, which helped push the Australian dollar to more than two-year highs.                  While other global central banks, including the Bank of England and the European Central Bank, are also signaling a more hawkish monetary policy tone, disappointing economic data has spurred doubt over whether the U.S. Federal Reserve will be able to raise interest rates again this year.     Meanwhile, Republican efforts to pass a healthcare overhaul bill in the U.S. Senate collapsed late on Monday, clouding expectations over whether Trump will make headway with his pro-growth agenda. An effort on Tuesday to repeal Obamacare without replacing it also failed.                  The U.S. dollar index has fallen 7.4 percent since the start of the year, partly on the doubts over U.S. President Donald Trump's fiscal stimulus agenda.            Canadian government bond prices were higher across the maturity curve, with the two-year            price up 1.5 Canadian cents to yield 1.191 percent and the benchmark 10-year             rising 30 Canadian cents to yield 1.86 percent.

Saudi Arabia showed a reduction of output so there's a little bit of strength from the data there,  said Tony Headrick, energy market analyst at CHS Hedging.  Saudi Arabia's crude oil exports in May fell to 6.924 million barrels per day (bpd) from 7.006 million bpd in April, official data showed on Tuesday. The top oil exporter's goal remains to stabilize oil markets by drawing down the global inventory overhang, a Saudi industry source familiar with the kingdom's oil policy said on Tuesday. Meanwhile in a sign of strong demand, data on Monday showed refineries in China increased crude throughput in June to the second highest on record. But many markets are well supplied and oil for prompt delivery is trading at heavy discounts to forward futures in several parts of the world. As a result, crude oil prices are trading at only around half the levels seen three years ago. A deal by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries with Russia and other non-OPEC producers to cut supplies by around 1.8 million barrels per day until March 2018 has so far failed to tighten the market or push up prices. Although many OPEC countries have restricted production, others including Nigeria and Libya are allowed to increase output. Ecuador said it would no longer comply with an agreed OPEC production cut of 26,000 bpd due to the country's financial difficulties.

U.S. oil production is also rising steadily. The U.S. Energy Department said in a report on Monday U.S. shale oil output was likely to rise for the eighth consecutive month in August, climbing 112,000 bpd to 5.585 million bpd. Oil prices briefly pared gains in post-settlement trade after data from the American Petroleum Institute (API) showed a surprise build of 1.6 million barrels in crude stocks for last week. Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast a draw of 3.2 million barrels.

Oil prices briefly pared gains in post-settlement trade after data from the American Petroleum Institute (API) showed a surprise build of 1.6 million barrels in crude stocks for last week. Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast a draw of 3.2 million barrels. The market will watch official inventory data on Wednesday morning from the U.S. Energy Department's Energy Information Administration.

President Nana Akufo-Addo's announcement is a surprise turnaround after government officials said last month that Ghana was considering a request by the Washington lender to extend the programme to December 2018. An extension would have reassured markets of the government's commitment to fiscal discipline, analysts say. Akufo-Addo said, however, the government was on target with its policy to restore growth and create private sector jobs.  There is no question about the IMF programme being extended beyond April 2018. We want to complete it and move on,  he told reporters. The Finance Ministry later said Akufo-Addo's remarks did not mean that Ghana was pulling out of the current programme.  On the contrary, government will continue with and complete the IMF programme through the budget circle of January 2018 through December 2018,  it said in a statement. The IMF board is due to review Ghana's progress under the deal in early August. Responding to Akufo-Addo's comments, the Fund maintained that an extension was essential for Ghana to successfully complete the review after failing to meet certain deal requirements on scheduled.  Following a significant setback in program implementation last year, making sure that the original program objectives can be achieved will take more time than initially expected,  IMF Ghana chief Natalia Koliadina said in an email response to Reuters after Akufo-Addo's remarks. Akufo-Addo's government inherited the $918-million agreement signed in April 2015 to address problems of slow growth, high public deficit and high public debt.

They said some funds sold August futures and simultaneously bought the October contract.     Positioning in advance of the U.S. Department of Agriculture monthly Cattle-On-Feed report on Friday exerted more market pressure.                      August         ended 1.875 cents per pound lower at 115.075 cents and below the 20-day moving average of 115.769 cents. October         closed 1.750 cents lower at 116.875 cents.     Investors are anxiously awaiting this week's sale of market-ready, or cash, cattle that a week ago brought mostly $118 to $121.50 per cwt.     Packers may need cattle for near-term delivery and supplies appear to be current, or coming to market on schedule and not backing in feedlots, said CHS Hedging broker Tim Hofer.     Processors might balk at paying more than they have to for cattle given their declining but still profitable margins - partly because of seasonally eroding wholesale beef values.                       Wednesday morning's Fed Cattle Exchange sale of roughly 2,900 animals could set the tone for this week's cash prices. Animals there last week brought $117.25 to $118.75 per cwt.     CME feeder cattle contracts sank more than 2 percent on profit-taking, sell stops and live cattle futures' selloff.     August feeders         ended 2.825 cents per pound lower, or down 2.02 percent, at 151.600 cents.      FRONT HOG MONTHS END WEAKER     Softer cash and wholesale pork prices weakened nearby CME lean hog futures, said traders.     They said investors sold August futures and at the same time bought 2018 contracts with the view that new plants coming on line next year will accommodate increased supplies.      August         closed down 0.275 cent per pound to 80.500 cents, and October         down 0.175 cent to 67.875 cents.     Ample near-term supplies weighed on cash prices, and wholesale pork values tend to peak this time of year as meat consumption wanes during sultry summer weather, analysts and traders said.

The investment is the largest specific project announcement since March in Vaca Muerta, one of the world's largest shale formations, as Argentine President Mauricio Macri's government tries to reduce reliance on gas imports that have strained Argentina's finances. The provincial government in Neuquen, where Vaca Muerta is located, has agreed to split the Aguada Pichana area into two parts and is also combining it with the Aguada de Castro area, according to a statement. Total will operate the eastern part of Aguada Pichana with a 41 percent stake, where 48 horizontal wells will be drilled through 2021, up from 12 currently. Pan American Energy will operate the western part as well as Aguada de Castro with a 45 percent stake and plans to drill 24 horizontal wells. The investments will double natural gas production in the area to 4.5 million cubic meters per day, up from 2.2 million cubic meters per day currently, Neuquen Governor Omar Gutierrez said at a news conference. Pan American Energy Executive Director Marcos Bulgheroni said lower logistics costs were still needed but added that  the development of Vaca Muerta is on a path of no return.  The partners had already invested $500 million in the areas between 2014 and 2016. In March, Argentina's Tecpetrol, part of the Techint Group, said it would invest $2.3 billion in the Vaca Muerta shale fields through 2019, marking the biggest announcement related to the formation in years. That investment came after the government said it would gradually lower the price it guarantees for gas drilled from new wells, currently $7.50 per million British thermal units of gas, to encourage investment sooner rather than later. Vaca Muerta contains 308 trillion cubic feet of shale gas and 16.2 billion barrels of shale oil, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

The working-level talks are scheduled to take place in Ottawa, said the sources, who asked to remain anonymous given the sensitivity of the situation.  The two sides will be looking for areas where they can work together,  said one of the sources. The meeting was scheduled before the United States on Monday released its goals for negotiations to update the North American Free Trade (NAFTA), which came into force in 1994. Washington's wish list contains potentially contentious items such as cutting the U.S. trade deficit with Mexico and Canada, boosting enforcement of labor standards and eliminating a trade dispute mechanism -- all of which will be discussed by the Canadian and Mexican delegations, said one source. Earlier on Tuesday, Canada's ambassador to Washington said it was critical for NAFTA to have a dispute resolution mechanism. The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump wants to  ditch the Chapter 19 mechanism that has hindered the United States from pursuing anti-dumping and anti-subsidy cases against Mexican and Canadian firms. FILE PHOTO - A car hauler heading for Detroit, Michigan, drives on the lane to Ambassador Bridge in Windsor, Ontario, Canada on April 28, 2017.Rebecca Cook/File Photo There are many things they raised where we take quite a different position. We think it's critical to have some kind of a dispute resolution mechanism incorporated -- it was in 1994 and it continues to be,  said envoy David MacNaughton.  Whether or not ... (it) can be improved or modernized, I think we're up for discussion on that,  he said in televised remarks to reporters in Edmonton, Alberta. Slideshow (2 Images)Under Chapter 19, which Canada insisted be in NAFTA, binational panels hear complaints about illegal subsidies and dumping and then issue binding decisions. The United States has frequently lost such cases. MacNaughton said he was not particularly surprised by the U.S. demands, many of which had been flagged ahead of time. Both Mexico and the United States face important elections in 2018 which could complicate the negotiations. Mexico says it would make sense to wrap up the talks by the end of this year, a goal Canadian officials say privately is impossible if the agreement is to be properly updated.  If we could get a clarification of the trading relationship sooner rather than later it would be better, but ... we're not going to rush into a bad deal,  said MacNaughton.

Trump's promises to cut taxes and boost spending has triggered expectations of faster inflation that could force the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates more than expected, potentially draining capital from emerging markets.     Trader skepticism over Trump's pledges grew after a second attempt by U.S. Senate Republicans to pass a healthcare reform bill failed, casting further doubt over the Fed's plan to hike rates once more this year.     Currencies from Brazil, Mexico, Chile and Colombia  strengthened between 0.5 percent and 0.8 percent, extending gains last week.      Mexico's peso traded at its strongest since early May 2016 while the Brazilian real firmed to its best against the dollar since mid-May 2017.     Wider emerging market stocks flirted with 27-month highs but Latin American bourses mostly slipped as traders feared slower growth could translate into lower U.S. imports from key trading partners in the region.

The peloton will tackle the punishing ascents of the Croix de Fer, Col du Telegraphe and Col du Galibier before a downhill finish in Serre-Chevalier in Wednesday's 17th stage. But the 18th stage will be the crucial one, ending up the lung-busting Col d'Izoard, where the  first big battle of the climbers  will be staged according to LeMond, a Tour winner in 1986, 1989 and 1990.  It will come down to Izoard, it will be the first big battle for climbers to win the Tour,  the American, who is on the Tour as an analyst for Eurosport, said in his daily chat with Reuters.  We've never seen a really all-out day of racing since the start. In Peyragudes, they just raced in the last 500 meters.  Wednesday's downhill finish, with a possible headwind, would make it hard for a lone rider to go all the way to the line.  It's not as explosive as you think (on Wednesday). The Croix de Fer is really hard and the Galibier is really long, but it will be hard to put time into Froome,  said LeMond. Chris Froome leads Italian Fabio Aru by 18 seconds and France's Romain Bardet by 23, with Colombian Rigoberto Uran in fourth place, 29 seconds off the pace. The Briton has a virtual extra advantage as he is expected to beat his rivals in the final time trial on Saturday.

I think they will race conservatively tomorrow and wait for the Izoard.  Last year's runner-up Bardet might hold the key as he has been the most aggressive rider this year.

Uran is going to surprise, he's been riding well and he has no pressure. Bardet, on the other hand, is under pressure. There are a lot of expectations.  No Frenchman has won the Tour since Bernard Hinault claimed the last of his five titles in 1985. The dark horse will be Spain's Mikel Landa, who is fifth overall 1:17 behind his Team Sky leader Froome. He has been instructed to work for the Briton but has sometimes looked stronger than him. Landa's contract with Sky expires at the end of the season and he is expected to sign for the Spanish team Movistar.  Landa has to ask himself if he wants to give the Tour de France to someone who will be his opponent next year,  LeMond concluded.

The working-level talks are scheduled to take place in Ottawa, said the sources, who asked to remain anonymous given the sensitivity of the situation.  The two sides will be looking for areas where they can work together,  said one of the sources. The meeting was scheduled before the United States on Monday released its goals for negotiations to update the North American Free Trade (NAFTA), which came into force in 1994. Washington's wish list contains potentially contentious items such as cutting the U.S. trade deficit with Mexico and Canada, boosting enforcement of labor standards and eliminating a trade dispute mechanism -- all of which will be discussed by the Canadian and Mexican delegations, said one source. Earlier on Tuesday, Canada's ambassador to Washington said it was critical for NAFTA to have a dispute resolution mechanism. The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump wants to  ditch the Chapter 19 mechanism that has hindered the United States from pursuing anti-dumping and anti-subsidy cases against Mexican and Canadian firms. FILE PHOTO - A car hauler heading for Detroit, Michigan, drives on the lane to Ambassador Bridge in Windsor, Ontario, Canada on April 28, 2017.Rebecca Cook/File Photo There are many things they raised where we take quite a different position. We think it's critical to have some kind of a dispute resolution mechanism incorporated -- it was in 1994 and it continues to be,  said envoy David MacNaughton.  Whether or not ... (it) can be improved or modernized, I think we're up for discussion on that,  he said in televised remarks to reporters in Edmonton, Alberta. Slideshow (2 Images)Under Chapter 19, which Canada insisted be in NAFTA, binational panels hear complaints about illegal subsidies and dumping and then issue binding decisions. The United States has frequently lost such cases. MacNaughton said he was not particularly surprised by the U.S. demands, many of which had been flagged ahead of time. Both Mexico and the United States face important elections in 2018 which could complicate the negotiations. Mexico says it would make sense to wrap up the talks by the end of this year, a goal Canadian officials say privately is impossible if the agreement is to be properly updated.  If we could get a clarification of the trading relationship sooner rather than later it would be better, but ... we're not going to rush into a bad deal,  said MacNaughton.

Zavala told a press conference that the centrist government of President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski expects the nation's economy to eventually reach a 5 percent annual rate of growth. Kuczynski's government had initially forecast the economy growing at a faster pace this year than its 3.9 percent expansion in 2016 but severe flooding and a graft scandal involving Brazilian builder Odebrecht has triggered a slowdown. Zavala said that the government is increasing the budget and the fiscal deficit will likely expand to 3 percent of gross domestic product this year and to 3.5 percent next year. Peru will likely tap global capital markets next year with a new sovereign bond issuance to either finance government spending or extend the life of the country's debt, Zavala added.

The company's shares jumped 24 percent to $164 after the bell and were on track to open at a record high on Wednesday. Once it has analyzed additional data and discussed development plans with regulators, Vertex said it will begin late stage studies of one or more of the triple combination regimens in the first half of 2018.  Vertex already sells two treatments, Kalydeco and Orkambi, that can treat up to 40 percent, or about 30,000 cystic fibrosis patients, based on their specific genetic mutations. The drugs were the first approved medicines to address the underlying cause of the disease rather than just treat symptoms.  In March, the company released late-stage trial data showing Kalydeco combined with the experimental drug tezacaftor led to significant lung function improvement. Vertex expects those two medicines to be the backbone of any triple drug therapy. The new data tested three different experimental drugs with that pairing of Kalydeco and tezacaftor.  We want to turn this into a chronic disease that patients live with,  said Vertex Chief Executive Jeffrey Leiden.  In small Phase II studies, patients who received 200 milligrams twice a day of the drug VX-152 showed a 9.7 percentage point improvement in volume of air exhaled in one second, a measure known as FEV1. Those who received VX-440 600 mg twice a day as part of the triple combination experienced 12 percentage points improvement in FEV1. Initial data from a Phase I study of VX-659 showed a mean absolute FEV1 improvement of 9.6 percentage points from baseline for the triple combination, Vertex said. Those studies involved cystic fibrosis patients with one F508del genetic mutation and one minimal function mutation. Orkambi, which combines Kalydeco with another drug, is approved for patients with two copies of the F508del mutation. The triple combinations were well tolerated with mostly mild to moderate adverse side effects, Vertex said. There was one discontinuation due to highly elevated liver enzymes.

Decio Oddone, director of oil regulator ANP, said the agency would open a 30-day comment period on the proposal, followed by a hearing and publication of the rule in September. Contracts signed since 2005 but before more flexible rules went into effect this year would be eligible. Content rules dictate what percent of a project's workers and inputs have to be local in origin.   We believe this new option will unlock investments, attracting capital and generating new hires, jobs and revenue,  Oddone said at a press conference in Rio de Janeiro. Many crude projects have been put on ice in Brazil, including exploration of the Libra oilfield in the subsalt region of the Santos basin, thought to be Brazil's largest oil reserve, due in part to steep costs stemming from tough local content rules.  Oddone said the ANP had received more than 230 requests for exemptions from the rules by companies with pre-existing contracts, including one by state-controlled oil firm Petrobras, which has partnered with Total, Shell and others to develop Libra.   In February, ANP sharply reduced local content requirements in future oil exploration and production contracts in a boon to oil companies but a major setback for local suppliers. If approved as proposed, the plan announced on Tuesday would extend the more flexible rules to older contracts.  On Tuesday, machine and equipment makers association ABIMAQ said it opposed the proposal, describing local content requirements as  low  and the decision as unilateral. The oil companies  have not only failed to comply with local content rules in the past ... they are now trying to get rid of those obligations,  said ABIMAQ Vice President Cesar Prata. The new resolution would also hammer out the rules for waiver requests and transfers of surplus local content which have been pending for more than a decade. The move is part of a wave of market-friendly measures imposed on the oil sector since conservative President Michel Temer took office last year after leftist Dilma Rousseff was ousted over breaking budget rules. Oddone also raised the possibility of reducing royalties for companies that decide to renew concessions in the future. He said an auction slated for Sept. 27 would allow firms to use oil and gas reserves as collateral for bank loans.

In a breach of party discipline that reveals the depth of anger within the African National Congress (ANC), Makhosi Khoza, a strident 47-year-old Zulu academic, chose Nelson Mandela's birthday to denounce Zuma as an insult to the memory of democratic South Africa's founding father.  I am here to defend the ANC mission, and not a dishonorable and disgraceful leader,  Khoza told a conference of civil society groups, unions and business leaders pushing for Zuma's removal in a no-confidence vote next month. The 75-year-old's time on power has been marked by economic stagnation and scandal, from a $16 million state-funded  security upgrade  at his home to allegations of graft involving his friends the Guptas, a family of Indian-born businessmen. Both Zuma and the Guptas have denied any wrongdoing. Echoing the private, moral anguish of many ANC cadres who have watched Africa's oldest liberation movement decline under Zuma, Khoza - an ANC supporter since the age of 12 - said she could no longer follow the orders of a flawed leadership.  The dilemma I had is this: what if such directives are morally bankrupt? What if such directives are directionless? What if such directives reflect arrogance, dishonesty, denialism?  Zuma faces the no-confidence motion on Aug. 8, the ninth time the opposition will have tried to unseat him by peeling off dissidents from the ruling party, whose majority has so far protected him by closing ranks. Next month's vote could be different: the Constitutional Court has cleared the way for the Speaker to allow a secret ballot, though it is not certain she will. Khoza has made clear she will break ranks. If 49 of the ANC's 249 MPs follow suit, Zuma could be out. Khoza said she did not know how many others would follow her lead, saying intimidation was preventing many from coming forward.

He has since resigned as an MP. One other ANC MP has told Reuters they would vote for Zuma's removal in a secret ballot. The South African Communist Party, whose 17 MPs back the ANC in parliament, said in April Zuma should resign.

Slideshow (2 Images)Last week, she received a death threat saying she had 21 days left to live, evidence, she said, of the regression of South African public life since the heady idealism of the early days of the  Rainbow Nation  born in 1994.  One does not expect this in a democratic, constitutional South Africa,  she told Reuters in an interview, saying it smacked of the dirty tricks, threats and murder against opponents that predominated under apartheid.  I'm taken back to the 1980s,  she said, recalling fighting and assassinations in her native KwaZulu-Natal.  I had my home burnt down. I lost relatives. To relive the moment 23 years after democracy is unsettling.  Khoza, an expert in Zulu linguisitics who holds a PhD in public administration, also ripped into Zuma's apparent disdain for African intellectuals, as shown by his dismissal in 2012 of dissenting voices as the prattlings of  clever blacks . Zuma's formal education ended at primary school.  I am black. I am clever. I am smart, I am educated,  Khoza said, to cheers from the crowd.  Therefore there is absolutely nothing wrong with me.  ANC chief whip Jackson Mthembu referred queries about Khoza's comments to the ANC.  I don't respond to Makhosi Khoza,  he said. ANC spokesman Zizi Kodwa and Zuma spokesman Bongani Ngqulunga did not answer their phones.

Decio Oddone, director of oil regulator ANP, said the agency would open a 30-day comment period on the proposal, followed by a hearing and publication of the rule in September. Contracts signed since 2005 but before more flexible rules went into effect this year would be eligible. Content rules dictate what percent of a project's workers and inputs have to be local in origin.   We believe this new option will unlock investments, attracting capital and generating new hires, jobs and revenue,  Oddone said at a press conference in Rio de Janeiro. Many crude projects have been put on ice in Brazil, including exploration of the Libra oilfield in the subsalt region of the Santos basin, thought to be Brazil's largest oil reserve, due in part to steep costs stemming from tough local content rules.  Oddone said the ANP had received more than 230 requests for exemptions from the rules by companies with pre-existing contracts, including one by state-controlled oil firm Petrobras, which has partnered with Total, Shell and others to develop Libra.   In February, ANP sharply reduced local content requirements in future oil exploration and production contracts in a boon to oil companies but a major setback for local suppliers. If approved as proposed, the plan announced on Tuesday would extend the more flexible rules to older contracts.  On Tuesday, machine and equipment makers association ABIMAQ said it opposed the proposal, describing local content requirements as  low  and the decision as unilateral. The oil companies  have not only failed to comply with local content rules in the past ... they are now trying to get rid of those obligations,  said ABIMAQ Vice President Cesar Prata. The new resolution would also hammer out the rules for waiver requests and transfers of surplus local content which have been pending for more than a decade. The move is part of a wave of market-friendly measures imposed on the oil sector since conservative President Michel Temer took office last year after leftist Dilma Rousseff was ousted over breaking budget rules. Oddone also raised the possibility of reducing royalties for companies that decide to renew concessions in the future. He said an auction slated for Sept. 27 would allow firms to use oil and gas reserves as collateral for bank loans.

Pull it out  root and branch,  he pledged. The 75-year-old Senate majority leader now has that luxury. But instead of basking in the glow of his first major legislative victory in the Donald Trump era, McConnell is what a source close to the majority leader calls  the man in the middle in an impossible spot.  Late on Monday and again on Tuesday, after a long struggle, McConnell's efforts to repeal all or portions of former President Barack Obama's landmark 2010 Affordable Care Act and replace them with less expensive healthcare came crashing down. With 52 Republican senators in the 100-member chamber, McConnell could lose only two of his colleagues on any bill that was opposed by Democrats and still win with Vice President Mike Pence casting the tie-breaking vote.  Three times, he failed to muster the 50 supporters needed.  The man who epitomized  the party of no  in Democrats' eyes during Obama's presidency, especially when he slammed the door in February 2016 on Merrick Garland's Supreme Court nomination, fell victim to the  no  of fellow Republicans.  We finally get a chance to repeal and replace, and they don't take advantage of it,  Trump, six months into his four-year presidential term, said on Tuesday. Across Washington, there was dismay Republicans could not deliver on a promise they assert helped them to assume control in January of Congress and the White House.  I am kind of shocked,  said Republican Representative Dave Brat, of the conservative firebrand House Freedom Caucus that has been a thorn in the side of the Republican establishment. His hand weakened, McConnell could be heading into fierce budget battles, a tax reform fight and a storm over legislation avoiding a government debt default that could shake global financial markets. The result has Democrats feeling emboldened 16 months before the next congressional elections. Reputation Questioned Around town, the sphinxlike McConnell is known as a master of Senate rules, able to outfox opponents, giving nothing away until he can strike at just the right moment. The senator's leadership job, a position he yearned for in the years leading up to his 2015 ascension, does not appear to be in jeopardy.  But this rocky run calls into question McConnell's reputation as a master tactician and deal-maker that he earned as Republican minority leader under the Democratic Obama. It is  a real blow to Republicans in Congress generally and to leadership,  said former Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, a Republican.  More of the blame sits with the rank-and-file, Lott said.  The problem in Washington today is not lack of leadership. The problem is lack of followership.  Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) references the  health care bill previously unveiled by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (not shown) during a press conference with (L-R) Senator Mike Enzi (R-WY), Senator Lamar Alexander (R-TN), Senator John Thune (R-SD), Senator Jon Kyl (R-AZ), Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), and Senator John Cornyn (R-TX) on Capitol Hill in Washington November 20, 2009.Molly RileyHad McConnell succeeded, Lott said he would have been  considered a magician  given the inability of Republicans to coalesce around healthcare legislation for so many years. A Republican operative with ties to McConnell saw a possible silver lining: Failure to pass healthcare could boost chances for tax reform or infrastructure investment if Republicans felt it a more urgent political imperative to rack up a win for Trump before the November 2018 congressional elections. Fatal Flaws? McConnell, a courtly Kentuckian who can appear at pains to speak to reporters nipping at his heels, won accolades in years past for cutting deals with Democrats to keep the government operating and making permanent most of former President George W. Bush's tax cuts. Those deals involved giving voters government services and lower taxes. But Republican healthcare legislation involves taking something away from millions of lower-income people - their medical coverage.  In part they (Republicans) misunderstood how difficult it will be  to repeal and replace Obamacare, former Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle, a Democrat, said in a phone interview. Slideshow (4 Images)Republican rhetoric against Obamacare was so  hyperbolic  it had to take priority early in Trump's presidency, but senators lacked enthusiasm for legislation, said Daschle, who like Lott lobbies on behalf of healthcare interests.  Once boxed into healthcare, McConnell took another controversial step, one that many Republicans questioned. Instead of developing a healthcare bill in public,  McConnell and his top aides, with the advice of a 13-member group of male senators, called the shots. McConnell said hearings were unnecessary, as healthcare policy had been intensively debated since Obama took office in 2009. He said he was listening to suggestions of all of his 51 fellow Republican senators. Many senators felt disconnected and tensions boiled over. As Monday wore on, matters only got worse for McConnell. Republican Senator Ron Johnson publicly accused him of  a real breach in trust  in hard-charging back-room negotiations. He threatened to withhold support for the bill. McConnell supporters argued that no matter how he handled the private negotiations, the Republican leader was dealt a difficult hand from the outset.  The majority leader is trying to keep all the frogs in the wheelbarrow and it's a tough job but he's doing a good job,  said Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski. And then there was Trump. As McConnell struggled, the president was in France last week celebrating Bastille Day before jetting back to the United States to attend a tournament at his New Jersey golf course. He tweeted about his excitement at the tournament, his disgust with  fake news  and an investigation into Russian influence in the 2016 election. Trump boasted that the White House  is functioning perfectly  and  I have very little time for watching T.V.  Missing, some Senate aides said, was Trump traveling the country in a serious effort to bolster support for McConnell's efforts.

Xinyi Zhang, a 21-year-old student from China who is studying accounting at the same Illinois school that the missing woman was attending, said the case has stirred deep anxiety for her and her family in China.      She said she had tried to shield her parents from details of the disappearance of Yingying Zhang, 26, who came to Illinois several months ago to study photosynthesis and crop productivity. But the Chinese media had covered the story too closely to keep them in the dark.  I just don't want them to be panicked,  said Xinyi Zhang, who is not related to the missing woman.  I am the only child they have, and the risk of losing me is just too huge to handle.      The business school student, who is home for the summer before returning to Illinois next month for her senior year, said her parents worry about her going back to her off-campus apartment. They have even suggested she apply to graduate school in a different country. The case came to a head this month when a 28-year-old former Illinois graduate student, Brendt Christensen, was charged with kidnapping Zhang, who went missing on June 9. Authorities believe she is dead, though no body has been found. Her misfortune has become a near-obsession with many of the 300,000 Chinese international students at U.S. colleges and their parents half a world away, lighting up social media and animating long-distance phone calls.  State-sponsored Chinese news media outlets have framed the case as emblematic of a security problem in the United States. The People's Daily, the Chinese Communist Party's official newspaper, wrote earlier this month that the kidnapping shows that China is  much safer  than America.

Macon County Sheriff's Office/Handout via REUTERSOn Weibo, a Chinese blogging site, commenters have repeatedly questioned the Federal Bureau of Investigation's effectiveness in investigating the case, said Berlin Fang, a Chinese newspaper columnist based in the United States.  Xiaotong Gui, a 20-year-old math student at Pomona College outside Los Angeles, said reading about the case made her feel unsafe on her own campus nearly 2,000 miles (3,200 km) from the Illinois university, which draws thousands of students from China.  On Johns Hopkins University's Baltimore campus, Luorongxin Yuan, a 20-year-old biology student from outside Nanjing, said the fact that the accused kidnapper was a graduate student has made her mother particularly anxious.  She doesn't trust anyone here anymore,  Yuan said. Before Christensen's arrest, federal agents put him under surveillance and heard him say that he had kidnapped Zhang, court documents show. A search of the suspect's cellphone revealed that he had visited a website that included threads on  perfect abduction fantasy.  His attorney has said his client is still presumed innocent. If convicted, Christensen could face up to life in prison.     Shen Qiwen, a spokesman for the Chinese consulate in Chicago, said Chinese officials hoped the FBI would step up efforts to find the missing scholar. The FBI is involved in the case because kidnapping is a federal crime. A spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's office did not respond to requests for comment.   Illinois business student Xinyi Zhang said many Chinese students are hoping for a miracle.   That could be me,  she said.  For some reason I'm still holding my hope, though, that there's a tiny, tiny chance that she's alive right now.

(Reuters) - Americans say they love U.S.-made goods. They are less enthusiastic, however, about paying a premium for them. At the AMES Companies Inc factory here, the wheelbarrows coming off the assembly line once every six seconds cost the company more to make in the United States than abroad, but U.S. retailers generally will not charge more for them because consumers would balk, AMES President Mark Traylor said. Nearly all U.S. manufacturers face the same squeeze.  A Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Tuesday found 70 percent of Americans think it is “very important” or “somewhat important” to buy U.S.-made products.  Despite that sentiment, 37 percent said they would refuse to pay more for U.S.-made goods versus imports. Twenty six percent said they would only pay up to 5 percent more to buy American, and 21 percent capped the premium at 10 percent. U.S. President Donald Trump rode into office on promises of bringing back manufacturing jobs and boosting economic growth, and has criticized companies that move production overseas.  Trump has also been quick to promote U.S.-made goods, and on Monday released a state-by-state  Made in America Product Showcase  that included AMES wheelbarrows. Lower-income Americans were the most enthusiastic about buying U.S. goods, the poll showed, despite being the least able to afford paying extra for them. Indeed, the biggest U.S. retailer is well aware of the priority buyers place on price above all else. A spokesman for Wal-Mart Stores Inc said customers are telling them “that where products are made is most important second only to price.” (GRAPHIC - Price of Patriotism, click tmsnrt.rs/2veSOVN) Eye on Quality The good news for U.S. factories is that Americans like the quality of many domestic goods.  Thirty-one percent in the poll said American-made cars are the best in the world. German cars were voted best by 23 percent of respondents. And thirty-eight percent said U.S.-made clothes were best.   Still, domestic manufacturers could be in trouble if they fail to capitalize on perceptions about the quality of their products while also keeping a tight lid on costs. In order to compete, companies like AMES have to find ways to offset their disadvantage “We don’t have to be as cheap as imports,” says Traylor, who estimated he sells his wheelbarrows to U.S. retailers for about 10 percent more than importers.  Factors like cheaper domestic freight and a desire among retailers to carry lower inventories can help make up some of the cost differential.  AMES is also better positioned than overseas suppliers to help retailers be agile. When spring comes early, for example, AMES can respond quickly to ship goods to stores, Traylor said, something importers with longer lead times on orders struggle to do. Traylor said another secret to success for U.S. manufacturers is investing in technology to cut costs.  AMES, a subsidiary of New York-based Griffon Corp, is pouring $50 million into upgrades at several locations. The Harrisburg factory, built in 1921, is dotted with aged machinery that has been fitted with robotic attachments to reduce reliance on human labor. AMES' annual sales are $514 million.   A production line employee works at the AMES Companies shovel manufacturing factory in Camp Hill, Pennsylvania, U.S. on June 29, 2017. Picture taken on June 29, 2017.Tim Aeppel?The company said it recently convinced a major retailer, who they did not want to identify, to switch from Mexican-made wheelbarrows to carry their product. AMES also said business is so strong that it is hiring 100 employees across its five Pennsylvania locations, including the Harrisburg factory.  Traylor says AMES wants to bring more work back from overseas. But that can be difficult.  And the production of certain components may prove impossible to ever bring back to U.S. soil. In late April, Trump marked his 100th day in office with a visit to the AMES plant. With workers chanting “USA, USA,” Trump asked if every part of the wheelbarrows was made in America. Everything, he was told, except the Chinese-made tires.  U.S. manufacturers stopped large-scale production of air-filled tires for garden equipment years ago, and the cost of setting up production now would be hard to justify for the low-margin product.  Slideshow (4 Images)Some rubber makers still manufacture solid rubber tires in the United States, but the last time AMES bought any they cost nearly twice the roughly $7 they pay for a Chinese tire, a big added cost for a wheelbarrow that often retails for less than $100. “Is it feasible to get U.S.-made tires?” asked Mark D’Agostino, the company’s vice president for supply chain. “We don’t know yet.” American Premium  To be sure, some manufacturers can command a big premium for American-made products.  Klein Tools Inc, a privately held company based outside Chicago with annual sales of $500 million, makes hand tools that are highly sought after by electricians and other workers.  A pair of 9-inch Klein pliers sells for about 30 percent more than a comparable import.  But betting on the allure of American-made goods can be risky. In 2012, High Point, North Carolina-based Stanley Furniture Co brought back production of cribs and other baby furniture from China to a U.S. plant, wagering that parents worried about a string of Chinese factory quality scandals would pay $700 for cribs nearly identical to imports selling for $400.  Customers refused to bite, however, and the High Point factory closed in 2014. Still, Stanley Chief Executive Glenn Prillaman said the Trump administration’s emphasis on American-made goods is a hopeful sign that resonates with “people that work for a living,” because they can see how it impacts their own jobs.   The lower-end consumers certainly care, and that’s a good thing,” he said. “But they’re also not in a position to pay the premium.” The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online in English throughout the United States from May 24 to May 31. It gathered responses from 2,857 people, including 593 adults who made less than $25,000 per year, 1,283 who said they earned between $25,000 and $74,999, and 805 people who earned more than $75,000.

Brazilian textile company Coteminas SA (CTNM4.SA) is the controlling shareholder of CGG. Its trading arm is a joint venture 43-percent-owned by Japan's Sojitz Corp (2768.T). Under the terms of the deal, the debt owed by the trading business will be repaid over seven years, with principal repayment starting after the third year.  Some of the banks involved in the deal were Banco do Brasil SA (BBAS3.SA), ABN Amro, Rabobank, Banco Bradesco SA (BBDC4.SA) and Banco Santander Brasil SA (SANB11.SA), according to CGG. ABN Amro did not reply to a request for comment. Banco do Brasil, Rabobank, Bradesco and Santander declined to comment.  The company pledged its Itaqui port terminal in northern Brazil as collateral for the refinanced debt. Earlier this year the company had refinanced $10 million of debt, executives said.  CGG now aims to step up commodities trading and farming after a management reshuffle that scrapped a former business plan focused on the cotton trade.  One of new management's first corrections was to exit the cotton space,  said Brandon Crozier, chief executive since November. Cotton is capital intensive and CGG lacked the expertise and balance sheet to succeed in that market, he said. This year CGG aims to trade some 800,000 tonnes of corn, down from 7 million tonnes of grains in 2014, as the firm focuses on improving profit margins through more efficient capital management.  CGG, one of the few Brazilian companies set up to both produce and trade agricultural commodities internationally, is also looking at ways to improve its farming business. The company owns 100,000 hectares of land, 70 percent of which is arable, with a productive capacity of 350,000 tonnes of grain, according to executives. Third parties are farming the land this year while CGG carries out its turnaround.  When CGG resumes farming, executives said they will focus on non-GMO, high-protein soymeal, industrial organics and alternative rotation crops like sorghum, which it hopes will give it an edge in niche markets.  We cannot be replicating what the ABCDs do well,  Crozier said, referring to ADM, Bunge, Cargill and Dreyfus that dominate global commodities trading.

The collapse of his fellow Republicans' push to overhaul or repeal Obamacare in the U.S. Senate again raised doubts in financial markets about Trump's ability to enact tax cuts and infrastructure spending. The dollar .DXY fell 0.51 percent against a basket of key currencies, setting a 10-month low and extending its 2017 decline to more than 7 percent.  The setback for Trump is a setback for the U.S. dollar,  said Kathy Lien, managing director at BK Asset Management in New York.  I think that really casts doubt on the Trump administration's broader strategies.  Wall Street ended mixed after a heavy dose of corporate earnings, with the Dow industrials sagging and the Nasdaq Composite hitting a record high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 54.99 points, or 0.25 percent, to 21,574.73.  But the S&P; 500 .SPX gained 1.47 points, or 0.06 percent, to 2,460.61 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 29.87 points, or 0.47 percent, to 6,344.31. Netflix (NFLX.O) shares soared after the streaming television company's strong customer growth, boosting the Nasdaq.    Goldman Sachs (GS.N) dropped 2.6 pct after its results, weighing on the Dow.  Harley-Davidson (HOG.N) shares tumbled after the motorcycle maker's weak forecast. In Europe, the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index .FTEU3 lost 1.11 percent. Sweden's Ericsson (ERICb.ST) and fashion retailer Zalando (ZALG.DE) plummeted after their respective reports. MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS gained 0.03 percent, hitting an all-time high for a fourth straight session. Traders work in front of the German share price index, DAX board, at the stock exchange in Frankfurt, Germany, July 18, 2017.Staff/RemoteThe euro EUR= was up 0.66 percent to $1.1554 against the dollar, and hit its strongest level against the U.S. currency since May 2016.  Aside from the Trump agenda setback, there are increasing doubts about further near-term rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. Expectations for the Fed hiking interest rates this year have been pushed back to the fourth quarter, the latest Reuters poll of economists showed. A poll conducted last month predicted the Fed would raise rates by September.  To think that (the dollar) will get back to where it was in early December is a very hard bet,” said Michael Purves, chief global strategist at Weeden & Co. Sterling fell against the dollar and euro, after data showed British inflation unexpectedly slowing for the first time since October last year, lowering expectations of an interest rate increase this year. U.S. Treasury yields fell, as investors grew cautious about the latest political drama in Washington, with weak economic data adding to the uncertainty about the pace of future interest rate hikes.  It does add some uncertainty as to whether the administration and a cooperative Congress is able to push through with priorities that was communicated in the election period,  said Bill Northey, chief investment officer at U.S. Bank Private Client Group in Helena, Montana. Benchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR last rose 14/32 in price to yield 2.2607 percent, from 2.309 percent late on Monday. Yields across the globe had risen sharply after Trump won the U.S. election in November on promises for tax reforms and infrastructure investment that were expected to boost growth and inflation in the world's largest economy. Oil prices rose slightly as Saudi exports fell and solid demand soaked up some of what is seen as an oversupplied market, but Ecuador's decision to opt out of a supply reduction pact complicated the outlook for the OPEC-led cut agreement.

(Reuters) - Lawyers for people injured by Takata Corp's defective air bags told a U.S. judge on Tuesday there was  no basis  for an  unjust  request by the company's U.S. unit to halt hundreds of consumer lawsuits against car companies that used the air bags. When the U.S. unit filed for bankruptcy in June, litigation against the unit for injuries, wrongful death, economic losses and breaches of consumer protection laws were automatically stayed. Last week, Takata's U.S. unit asked for a preliminary injunction that would halt similar lawsuits against Honda Motor Co, Toyota Motor Corp and other car companies that used the air bags. Halting the litigation would help Takata sell its healthy business to Key Safety Systems, which is owned by China's Ningbo Joyson Electronic Corp, according to TK Holdings Inc, the U.S. unit. Funds from that $1.6 billion proposed sale will be used to compensate injured drivers, according to court papers filed in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Delaware. Plaintiffs lawyers, however, have said the U.S. bankruptcy is being used by automakers to protect themselves from spiraling litigation. The air bags, which degrade over time and inflate with too much force, have been tied to at least 17 deaths and 180 injuries worldwide. They are subject to the largest recall in automotive history which will eventually cover 125 million inflators, many of which still need to be replaced. The cost of the recall forced the Japanese company and TK Holdings into bankruptcy in June in Japan and the United States. At a hearing on Tuesday, attorney Dean Ziehl said there was  no basis  to block claims against the automakers during the bankruptcy. He represents an official committee of injured drivers in the bankruptcy that was appointed earlier this month. Ziehl said the requested injunction was solely to benefit automakers. Adam Levitt, a lawyer for the state of New Mexico, which has sued Takata and automakers for violating consumer protection laws, called the request  unjust  and  extraordinary.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Brendan Shannon set an Aug. 9 hearing on the requested injunction, a schedule Ziehl criticized as  aggressive.  Ziehl said his committee intended to seek  substantial, expedited discovery  to investigate the motivation for requesting the injunction.

The high court unanimously ruled in March that Kansas' school funding system fell short of the adequacy requirement, but gave the state until June 30 to come up with a remedy. Legislation for a two-year funding boost totaling $293 million by fiscal 2019 was enacted by Republican Governor Sam Brownback last month. The law was characterized as inadequate by lawyers representing school districts that sued the state. In arguments before the court on Tuesday, justices raised concerns that the new law continued to fall short. Chief Justice Lawton Nuss questioned why lawmakers pushed aside a recommendation by the Kansas State Board of Education for a $893 million increase.  Aren't they the experts on education?  Nuss asked. Other justices raised concerns that the state's budget troubles may have put a cap on extra money for schools and that it could take years to determine the outcomes of the new funding formula on student achievement. Before deciding on a school funding fix, the legislature last month hiked income tax rates over Brownback's veto to address big budget gaps. Jeffrey King, a special assistant attorney general, told the court the amount of available revenue was  absolutely  a factor for the legislature, but only to ensure the law could meet its additional funding target.  There is new funding in this formula students will benefit from on day one,  King said. Alan Rupe, an attorney for school districts, said the legislature chose to ignore the state board of education's recommendation and opted for a lower amount that  is not enough.   We believe the magnitude of the solution needs to meet the magnitude of the problem,  he told the court. Nuss gave no indication of when the court would issue a ruling. The lawsuit, which dates back to 2010, also resulted in a state supreme court ruling requiring Kansas to address funding disparities between rich and poor school districts.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/kansas-education-idUSL1N1K91UY"},

On Wednesday, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's rule abolishing  mandatory arbitration  clauses will be published in a directory of regulatory actions called the Federal Register, starting the timer for two possible ways of undoing it. The rule bans companies from requiring customers to sign agreements when opening new accounts that they will not join a group lawsuit, or class action, in the event of a dispute. Critics say such lawsuits only benefit lawyers and that arbitration is a quick, cost-effective alternative to the courts. Once the rule is published, anyone sitting on the council of the country's top financial regulators can petition for a stay within 10 days by showing it significantly risks injuring the banking system. One member, Acting Comptroller of the Currency Keith Noreika, started moving toward that step after the rule's final version was released last week. The rule will also be open to possible nullification under the Congressional Review Act. Already powerful Senate Republicans, including Banking Committee Chairman Mike Crapo, are drafting a resolution to kill the rule. Under the Congressional Review Act, Congress could take up to six months to consider the resolution. However, both attempts to stymie the rule could fail. Noreika contends his office has not been able to review data used to write the rule. He and CFPB Director Richard Cordray have exchanged slightly hostile letters over the last week, and on Tuesday Cordray wrote that the CFPB is  assembling the data your staff has requested.  Noreika replied in a statement that he would  conduct an independent review of the data and analysis in a timely manner.” But Cordray says his agency released a thorough analysis two years ago and a rulemaking proposal more than a year ago that was accompanied by extensive research. Cordray also points out that Congress banned the arbitration clauses from mortgages and did not injure that market, casting doubt on Noreika's safety and soundness concerns. In the Senate, a nullification resolution could be crowded out by other, more pressing business. A third line of attack is less bound by time. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce lobbying group may announce as soon as Wednesday, when it holds an event on arbitration, that it is suing over the rule.

Japan's holding of Treasuries grew to $1.111 trillion in May from $1.107 trillion in April. In March, Japan's holdings totaled $1.121 trillion. China's stake in U.S. government securities increased to $1.102 trillion, the second most behind Japan, from $1.092 trillion in April. China's higher Treasuries holdings was in step with its rising foreign exchange reserves in the wake of tighter capital controls and a weaker dollar.

The collapse of his fellow Republicans' push to overhaul or repeal Obamacare in the U.S. Senate again raised doubts in financial markets about Trump's ability to enact tax cuts and infrastructure spending. The dollar .DXY fell 0.51 percent against a basket of key currencies, setting a 10-month low and extending its 2017 decline to more than 7 percent.  The setback for Trump is a setback for the U.S. dollar,  said Kathy Lien, managing director at BK Asset Management in New York.  I think that really casts doubt on the Trump administration's broader strategies.  Wall Street ended mixed after a heavy dose of corporate earnings, with the Dow industrials sagging and the Nasdaq Composite hitting a record high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 54.99 points, or 0.25 percent, to 21,574.73.  But the S&P; 500 .SPX gained 1.47 points, or 0.06 percent, to 2,460.61 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 29.87 points, or 0.47 percent, to 6,344.31. Netflix (NFLX.O) shares soared after the streaming television company's strong customer growth, boosting the Nasdaq.    Goldman Sachs (GS.N) dropped 2.6 pct after its results, weighing on the Dow.  Harley-Davidson (HOG.N) shares tumbled after the motorcycle maker's weak forecast. In Europe, the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index .FTEU3 lost 1.11 percent. Sweden's Ericsson (ERICb.ST) and fashion retailer Zalando (ZALG.DE) plummeted after their respective reports. MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS gained 0.03 percent, hitting an all-time high for a fourth straight session. Traders work in front of the German share price index, DAX board, at the stock exchange in Frankfurt, Germany, July 18, 2017.Staff/RemoteThe euro EUR= was up 0.66 percent to $1.1554 against the dollar, and hit its strongest level against the U.S. currency since May 2016.  Aside from the Trump agenda setback, there are increasing doubts about further near-term rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. Expectations for the Fed hiking interest rates this year have been pushed back to the fourth quarter, the latest Reuters poll of economists showed. A poll conducted last month predicted the Fed would raise rates by September.  To think that (the dollar) will get back to where it was in early December is a very hard bet,” said Michael Purves, chief global strategist at Weeden & Co. Sterling fell against the dollar and euro, after data showed British inflation unexpectedly slowing for the first time since October last year, lowering expectations of an interest rate increase this year. U.S. Treasury yields fell, as investors grew cautious about the latest political drama in Washington, with weak economic data adding to the uncertainty about the pace of future interest rate hikes.  It does add some uncertainty as to whether the administration and a cooperative Congress is able to push through with priorities that was communicated in the election period,  said Bill Northey, chief investment officer at U.S. Bank Private Client Group in Helena, Montana. Benchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR last rose 14/32 in price to yield 2.2607 percent, from 2.309 percent late on Monday. Yields across the globe had risen sharply after Trump won the U.S. election in November on promises for tax reforms and infrastructure investment that were expected to boost growth and inflation in the world's largest economy. Oil prices rose slightly as Saudi exports fell and solid demand soaked up some of what is seen as an oversupplied market, but Ecuador's decision to opt out of a supply reduction pact complicated the outlook for the OPEC-led cut agreement. U.S. crude CLcv1 rose 1 percent to $46.48 per barrel and Brent LCOcv1 was last at $48.91, up 1.01 percent on the day. Copper CMCU3 rose 0.13 percent to $6,004.00 a tonne.

JPMorgan boss Jamie Dimon raised the reasonable question last week. The answer is Lloyd Blankfein at rival Wall Street firm Goldman Sachs, which on Tuesday reported a 40 percent year-on-year slump in revenue from trading bonds, currencies and commodities. Goldman’s market compass is a little off, and investors may soon expect Blankfein to fix it more quickly. The quarter to June was the second in a row in which the $90 billion financial group run has been out-traded by its peers. While others warned that the period would be less good than a year earlier – basically because fewer freaky things happened in the market – JPMorgan and Citigroup reported revenue shrinkage in their equivalent divisions less than half as severe as Goldman’s. They may be less exposed to commodities or benefit more from steady corporate business rather than hedge funds. And swings in markets can have a bigger impact on Goldman because it lacks a large commercial banking business. Last quarter, the firm’s dire fixed-income performance was offset by strong equities trading and a $1.2 billion slug of revenue from equity investments Goldman holds on its own book.  Over time, the firm’s exposure to volatile fixed-income trading will become more muted. In the most recent quarter FICC, as it’s known, made up around 15 percent of net revenue, against 24 percent in the second quarter of 2016. Blankfein’s push into retail banking is still in its infancy, but the 20 percent-plus returns on equity that other consumer lenders manage – more than twice what Goldman reported last quarter – suggest that’s a promising new direction. Targeting less flighty corporate clients and longer-term asset managers may also muffle some of the noise, though that will take time too. Of course, that will also dampen Goldman’s traditionally unmatched ability to ping back dramatically when markets do. That ping-back potential – referred to in analyst-speak as operating leverage – is a big part of Goldman’s investment appeal. It helps explain why the bank trades at 1.1 times its estimated book value a year from now, according to Eikon. The implication is that investors believe Goldman can push its return on equity well into double digits. As Dimon at JPMorgan suggested, a few bad trading weeks needn’t change their minds. But a couple more uninspiring quarters might.BreakingviewsReuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

Sheeran's Twitter account, which boasts 14 million followers, appeared to have been deactivated on Monday. On Tuesday, it was live again, but many of Sheeran's 30,000 tweets, including recent posts and comments from fans, had been deleted.   Singer Ed Sheeran performs on NBC's 'Today' show in New York City, U.S., July 6, 2017.Brendan McDermidA representative for the British singer did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  Sheeran was active on Instagram on Tuesday, posting a photo of a cat and a picture from the set of  Game of Thrones.  On Sunday he also posted photos and a video of his  Game of Thrones  cameo. Sheeran's scene on Sunday's HBO medieval fantasy series, in which he plays a singing soldier who encounters character Arya Stark, garnered mixed reception from avid  Game of Thrones  fans. Many criticized his cameo as distracting in a show that does not usually use celebrities.  The 26-year-old singer, whose latest album,  Divide,  topped charts in the United States and Britain earlier this year, has been vocal about his dislike of Twitter.  He told Britain's Sun newspaper earlier this month that it was  nothing but people saying mean things  and that he had stopped using the platform regularly.

(Reuters) - Lawyers for people injured by Takata Corp's defective air bags told a U.S. judge on Tuesday there was  no basis  for an  unjust  request by the company's U.S. unit to halt hundreds of consumer lawsuits against car companies that used the air bags. When the U.S. unit filed for bankruptcy in June, litigation against the unit for injuries, wrongful death, economic losses and breaches of consumer protection laws were automatically stayed. Last week, Takata's U.S. unit asked for a preliminary injunction that would halt similar lawsuits against Honda Motor Co, Toyota Motor Corp and other car companies that used the air bags.  Halting the litigation would help Takata sell its healthy business to Key Safety Systems, which is owned by China's Ningbo Joyson Electronic Corp, according to TK Holdings Inc, the U.S. unit. Funds from that $1.6 billion proposed sale will be used to compensate injured drivers, according to court papers filed in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Delaware. Plaintiffs lawyers, however, have said the U.S. bankruptcy is being used by automakers to protect themselves from spiraling litigation.  The air bags, which degrade over time and inflate with too much force, have been tied to at least 17 deaths and 180 injuries worldwide.     They are subject to the largest recall in automotive history which will eventually cover 125 million inflators, many of which still need to be replaced. The cost of the recall forced the Japanese company and TK Holdings into bankruptcy in June in Japan and the United States. At a hearing on Tuesday, attorney Dean Ziehl said there was  no basis  to block claims against the automakers during the bankruptcy. He represents an official committee of injured drivers in the bankruptcy that was appointed earlier this month. Ziehl said the requested injunction was solely to benefit automakers. Adam Levitt, a lawyer for the state of New Mexico, which has sued Takata and automakers for violating consumer protection laws, called the request  unjust  and  extraordinary.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Brendan Shannon set an Aug. 9 hearing on the requested injunction, a schedule Ziehl criticized as  aggressive.  Ziehl said his committee intended to seek  substantial, expedited discovery  to investigate the motivation for requesting the injunction.

(Reuters) - Lawyers for people injured by Takata Corp's defective air bags told a U.S. judge on Tuesday there was  no basis  for an  unjust  request by the company's U.S. unit to halt hundreds of consumer lawsuits against car companies that used the air bags. When the U.S. unit filed for bankruptcy in June, litigation against the unit for injuries, wrongful death, economic losses and breaches of consumer protection laws were automatically stayed. Last week, Takata's U.S. unit asked for a preliminary injunction that would halt similar lawsuits against Honda Motor Co, Toyota Motor Corp and other car companies that used the air bags.  Halting the litigation would help Takata sell its healthy business to Key Safety Systems, which is owned by China's Ningbo Joyson Electronic Corp, according to TK Holdings Inc, the U.S. unit. Funds from that $1.6 billion proposed sale will be used to compensate injured drivers, according to court papers filed in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Delaware. Plaintiffs lawyers, however, have said the U.S. bankruptcy is being used by automakers to protect themselves from spiraling litigation.  The air bags, which degrade over time and inflate with too much force, have been tied to at least 17 deaths and 180 injuries worldwide.     They are subject to the largest recall in automotive history which will eventually cover 125 million inflators, many of which still need to be replaced. The cost of the recall forced the Japanese company and TK Holdings into bankruptcy in June in Japan and the United States. At a hearing on Tuesday, attorney Dean Ziehl said there was  no basis  to block claims against the automakers during the bankruptcy. He represents an official committee of injured drivers in the bankruptcy that was appointed earlier this month. Ziehl said the requested injunction was solely to benefit automakers. Adam Levitt, a lawyer for the state of New Mexico, which has sued Takata and automakers for violating consumer protection laws, called the request  unjust  and  extraordinary.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Brendan Shannon set an Aug. 9 hearing on the requested injunction, a schedule Ziehl criticized as  aggressive.  Ziehl said his committee intended to seek  substantial, expedited discovery  to investigate the motivation for requesting the injunction. The requested injunction would not affect a $553 million class action settlement over economic losses, which was reached with Toyota, BMW AG, Mazda Motor Co and Subaru Corp.

The state missed its July 1 deadline to pass a biennial budget for the current and next fiscal year, leading Governor Dannel Malloy, a Democrat, to take over state spending and slash costs. A huge revenue slump in April, coupled with increased economic weakness, led all three credit rating agencies to downgrade Connecticut in May. Labor costs were one sticking point in budget talks as lawmakers differ with each other and Malloy over how to close a $5.1 billion shortfall over the next two years. The State Employee Bargaining Agent Coalition (SEBAC), which covers about 42,000 members in 15 different unions for public employees, agreed to increased pension and healthcare contributions and furloughs, among other changes. Malloy said in a statement the deal would save taxpayers more than $20 billion over the long term and provide short-term savings that would help balance the budget.  They agreed to historic concessions that will put the state on a sustainable path,  he said.  Now, it's up to the legislature to do their part and approve this agreement.  There is no guarantee that state lawmakers will sign off on the deal. Although Malloy's fellow Democrats dominate the House of Representatives and are evenly split with Republicans for control of the Senate, the legislature has not been able to agree on a budget plan or reach compromise with Malloy. Jan Hochadel, president of AFT Connecticut, noted the potential struggle with lawmakers in an internal memo to her members on Tuesday announcing the ratification of the master agreement. The AFT, representing school teachers and staffers, is a SEBAC member.  After a legislative session marked by an unprecedented number of anti-union proposals, we would be foolish to assume we won't need to advocate for lawmakers to support them,  Hochadel wrote.

It could have been a disturbance or anything to make them come out.  Sewers are normally cleaned out every few months by the water department and more frequently when a complaint is received, according to DiGiulio.

Leiden,VERTEX,CYSTICFIBROSIS/,Americas,Company News,Health / Medicine,Corporate Events,Biotechnology and Medical Research (TRBC),General News,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Research (TRBC),Science,Respiratory Conditions,Healthcare (TRBC),United States","sector":"Markets","content":"July 18 (Reuters) - Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc on Tuesday said three different triple combinations of cystic fibrosis treatments significantly improved patient lung function in clinical trials, bolstering its goal of a therapy that could help up to 90 percent of patients with the life-shortening lung disease. Once it has analyzed additional data and discussed development plans with regulators, Vertex said it will begin late stage studies of one or more of the triple combination regimens in the first half of 2018. Vertex already sells two treatments, Kalydeco and Orkambi, that can treat up to 40 percent, or about 30,000 cystic fibrosis patients, based on their specific genetic mutations. The drugs were the first approved medicines to address the underlying cause of the disease rather than just treat symptoms. In March, the company released late-stage trial data showing Kalydeco combined with the experimental drug tezacaftor led to significant lung function improvement. Vertex expects those two medicines to be the backbone of any triple drug therapy. The new data tested three different experimental drugs with that pairing of Kalydeco and tezacaftor.  We want to turn this into a chronic disease that patients live with,  said Vertex Chief Executive Jeffrey Leiden. In small Phase II studies, patients who received 200 milligrams twice a day of the drug VX-152 showed a 9.7 percentage point improvement in volume of air exhaled in one second, a measure known as FEV1. Those who received VX-440 600 mg twice a day as part of the triple combination experienced 12 percentage points improvement in FEV1. Initial data from a Phase I study of VX-659 showed a mean absolute FEV1 improvement of 9.6 percentage points from baseline for the triple combination, Vertex said. Those studies involved cystic fibrosis patients with one F508del genetic mutation and one minimal function mutation. Orkambi, which combines Kalydeco with another drug, is approved for patients with two copies of the F508del mutation. The triple combinations were well tolerated with mostly mild to moderate adverse side effects, Vertex said. There was one discontinuation due to highly elevated liver enzymes. The company also announced initial data showing improvements in mean absolute FEV1 of 7.3 and 9.5 percentage points when either VX-152 or VX-440 was added in patients with two copies of the F508del mutation already receiving tezacaftor and Kalydeco.

The high court unanimously ruled in March that Kansas' school funding system fell short of the adequacy requirement, but gave the state until June 30 to come up with a remedy. Legislation for a two-year funding boost totaling $293 million by fiscal 2019 was enacted by Republican Governor Sam Brownback last month. The law was characterized as inadequate by lawyers representing school districts that sued the state.  In arguments before the court on Tuesday, justices raised concerns that the new law continued to fall short. Chief Justice Lawton Nuss questioned why lawmakers pushed aside a recommendation by the Kansas State Board of Education for a $893 million increase.  Aren't they the experts on education?  Nuss asked. Other justices raised concerns that the state's budget troubles may have put a cap on extra money for schools and that it could take years to determine the outcomes of the new funding formula on student achievement. Before deciding on a school funding fix, the legislature last month hiked income tax rates over Brownback's veto to address big budget gaps. Jeffrey King, a special assistant attorney general, told the court the amount of available revenue was  absolutely  a factor for the legislature, but only to ensure the law could meet its additional funding target.  There is new funding in this formula students will benefit from on day one,  King said.  Alan Rupe, an attorney for school districts, said the legislature chose to ignore the state board of education's recommendation and opted for a lower amount that  is not enough.   We believe the magnitude of the solution needs to meet the magnitude of the problem,  he told the court. Nuss gave no indication of when the court would issue a ruling.

Analysts say the knee-jerk reactions in stocks in the wake of President Donald Trump's election on Nov. 8, fueled by the hopes for his agenda of cutting taxes, infrastructure spending and reducing regulations, have partly or fully unwound and investors are no longer pricing in any business-friendly legislation in 2017.  The expectation for this administration to get anything passed is low. You had zero room for error on a (healthcare) bill that’s hard to get passed. The revelation isn’t shocking,  said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities in New York.  It's hard to do a tax reform in the style that it was campaigned on. The healthcare hurdle pushes everything in Trump's agenda to 2018.  Stocks have continued to rise, with the S&P; 500 hitting a record high last Friday. But several of the early stock winners of the Trump era have faded. Here is a look at four  Trump trades,  how they fared in the aftermath of Trump's election in November and how that compares to their performance since he took office in January. Obamacare Repeal & Replace Barometer: Index of five hospital stocks (HCA Holdings (HCA.N), Tenet Healthcare (THC.N), Universal Health Services (UHS.N), Community Health Systems (CYH.N), LifePoint Health (LPNT.O)) Election to inauguration: -7.1 percent Inauguration to present: +10 percent President Trump's vow to immediately repeal the Affordable Care Act, which benefited hospitals by expanding insurance coverage, sent those stocks reeling. The immediate repeal did not materialize and subsequent efforts to replace the legislation have failed. After two Republicans said on Monday they would not back the latest Obamacare rollback bill, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell threw in the towel and said he would schedule a vote in coming days on a two-year transition to simply repealing the 2010 healthcare law with no replacement. A third Republican U.S. senator on Tuesday said she could not back any legislation to repeal Obamacare without a replacement plan, effectively blocking McConnell's plan. Infrastructure Barometer: Index of six infrastructure-related stocks (Caterpillar (CAT.N), Terex (TEX.N), Vulcan Materials (VMC.N), AECOM (ACM.N), Granite Construction (GVA.N), Nucor (NUE.N)) Election to inauguration: +13 percent Inauguration to present: -1.8 percent Trump's vow to spend $1 trillion on infrastructure helped lead to a windfall for many investors in industries such as construction, engineering, building materials and steel in the immediate aftermath of the election. Performance of the stocks has leveled off as infrastructure seems to be a non-urgent matter in Congress. Steel got a bump last week after Trump said he is considering quotas and tariffs to deal with the  big problem  of steel dumping from China and others. Banks Barometer: S&P; 500 banks index .SPXBK Election to inauguration: +20.8 percent Inauguration to present: +6.2 percent Perhaps no sector benefited as much from President Trump's election as banking in the immediate aftermath of his win. Optimism over his ability to roll back regulations boosted the group. Expectations that his agenda would stimulate the economy, promoting inflation and higher interest rates, also energized investors in banking stocks. But the sector's gains have slowed under the weight of soft economic data -and importantly as inflation fails to pick up. Low inflation and a low neutral rate may leave the Federal Reserve with diminished leeway to keep raising rates, Fed Chair Janet Yellen said last week. Tax Cuts Barometer: Russell 2000 index of small-cap stocks  Election to inauguration: +12.6 percent Inauguration to present: +5.9 percent Trump's plan to cut taxes broadly and reform the tax code gave investors reason to be optimistic about U.S. equities after his election, particularly investing in smaller companies that tend to be more domestically focused. But the failure of the healthcare bill pushes the expectation of a 'as-promised' tax reform even lower.

The state missed its July 1 deadline to pass a biennial budget for the current and next fiscal year, leading Governor Dannel Malloy, a Democrat, to take over state spending and slash costs. A huge revenue slump in April, coupled with increased economic weakness, led all three credit rating agencies to downgrade Connecticut in May. Labor costs were one sticking point in budget talks as lawmakers differ with each other and Malloy over how to close a $5.1 billion shortfall over the next two years. The State Employee Bargaining Agent Coalition (SEBAC), which covers about 42,000 members in 15 different unions for public employees, agreed to increased pension and healthcare contributions and furloughs, among other changes. Malloy said in a statement the deal would save taxpayers more than $20 billion over the long term and provide short-term savings that would help balance the budget.  They agreed to historic concessions that will put the state on a sustainable path,  he said.  Now, it's up to the legislature to do their part and approve this agreement.  There is no guarantee that state lawmakers will sign off on the deal. Although Malloy's fellow Democrats dominate the House of Representatives and are evenly split with Republicans for control of the Senate, the legislature has not been able to agree on a budget plan or reach compromise with Malloy. Jan Hochadel, president of AFT Connecticut, noted the potential struggle with lawmakers in an internal memo to her members on Tuesday announcing the ratification of the master agreement. The AFT, representing school teachers and staffers, is a SEBAC member.  After a legislative session marked by an unprecedented number of anti-union proposals, we would be foolish to assume we won't need to advocate for lawmakers to support them,  Hochadel wrote.

Most of the symptoms improved after the lifeguards left work, suggesting that chemicals used to maintain indoor pools may be triggering the symptoms, the study authors report in the International Journal of Environmental Health Research. “In the past years, in the province of Quebec as well as in other jurisdictions, lifeguards’ and competitive swimmers’ awareness of potential irritative effects related to indoor swimming pools increased,” lead author Gabrielle Bureau told Reuters Health in an email. “However, this study clearly highlights the fact that indoor swimming pool environments may have adverse health effects on the respiratory system and suggest a relationship between respiratory symptoms and the time spent in this environment as a lifeguard,” said Bureau,  a researcher at the Department of Social and Preventive Medicine of Laval University in Quebec City. The researchers surveyed current and former licensed lifeguards using online questionnaires to assess their exposure to swimming pool environments and certain symptoms such as cough, sputum, shortness of breath, wheezing, lung congestion, sneezing, throat or eye irritation, hoarseness, stuffy nose and ear pain.  In addition, the lifeguards were asked if they had been diagnosed with asthma or used asthma medications.  Of the 870 respondents, 601 were currently working as lifeguards and three quarters were women. Their ages ranged from 18 to 64 years, with an average age of 22 for current lifeguards and 29 for former lifeguards.  About 78 percent of the lifeguards reported having at least one respiratory symptom in the previous year and 23 percent reported having physician-diagnosed asthma.  Lifeguards exposed to the pool more than 500 hours during the previous year were about two and a half times more likely to have a cough or sore throat than those exposed less than 50 hours. They were also over four times more likely to have eye irritation.  Among lifeguards with asthma, those exposed more than 500 hours a year were six times more likely to have asthma attacks than those with little or no exposure to the indoor pool environment. “We found that the most exposed lifeguards in the past 12 months were more susceptible to have a cough, hoarseness and throat and eye irritation during this period. Furthermore, we found that most exposed lifeguards over their lifetime had significantly more chances of suffering from various symptoms while on duty,” Bureau said. “Most of the swimming pools worldwide are disinfected with chlorine-based disinfectants,” she noted. The reaction between free chlorine and organic matter such as sloughed skin cells, cosmetics, urine, sunscreen and sweat in water generates a high number of contaminants called disinfection-by-products (DBP), Bureau said. “One of those DBPs is the trichloramine (NCl3), a highly volatile contaminant that gives indoor swimming pools their characteristic ‘chlorine smell,’” she said, and NCl3 is the most likely contaminant to cause irritative symptoms.  “The present findings underscore the need to implement and respect preventive measures. To that extent, it is important to limit the entry of organic matter into the water to decrease the amount of disinfection-by-products generated,” she said. Taking specific hygiene measures such as using the toilet and showering with soap before swimming, using swimming caps, taking children to the toilet frequently, using diapers specially designed for swimming would be important, Bureau said. “Moreover, measures like adequate filtration, tight chlorination control, regular monitoring of chlorination parameters, adequate ventilation at all times are essential to improve water and air quality in indoor swimming pools and prevent the occurrence of irritative and respiratory symptoms,” she said.

Scharf immediately replaces as CEO 65-year-old Gerald Hassell, who will remain chairman of BNY Mellon until the end of the year when he retires. Scharf will then become chairman.  The first priority is growing the company organically,  Scharf told Reuters.  We already are in places that have tremendous amounts of opportunity.  BNY Mellon had $30.6 trillion in assets under custody and administration at the end of March. The bank's massive platform is a key part of the plumbing that keeps global financial markets flowing. Besides safeguarding the stocks and bonds of large institutions, the bank calculates mutual fund prices, trades foreign currencies and facilitates securities lending to enable short selling by hedge funds, for example.  Scharf, who headed Visa from October 2012 to December 2016, played a key role in orchestrating the world's largest payments network's reunion with its European affiliate.  It looks to me they got the right guy,  said Daniel O'Keefe, who runs the $2.9 billion Artisan Global Value Fund (ARTGX.O). That fund owned about 2.1 million BNY Mellon shares at the end of June, or 3.7 percent of its net assets. BNY Mellon shares closed up 1.9 percent at $53.35. The stock rose about 145 percent during the last five years of Hassell's tenure, which began in late August 2011. The S&P; 500 Index .SPX is up 81 percent over the past five years. Visa CEO Charles Scharf (2nd R) and company executives ring the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange, March 19, 2013.Brendan McDermidIn recent years, O'Keefe and other large BNY Mellon investors, including Nelson Peltz's Trian Partners, pushed for change at the bank. Hassell felt the brunt of the heat, getting support and a rebuke from Trian partner and chief investment officer Ed Garden at the bank's 2015 annual meeting.  Still, O'Keefe said Scharf will run a company that is in a good position.   Visa is a platform and a systems business, one of the best in the world,  O'Keefe said.  BNY is also effectively a systems and platform business. Its future lies in optimizing those systems and driving out costs.  Scharf and Hassell, during an interview with Reuters, agreed that the bank's ability to wring out costs and keep up with the pace of change in technology will be a key part of its future. On a conference call BNY Mellon held on Monday afternoon with financial analysts, two asked about the timing of the executive change, which one called  a little abrupt.  Joseph Echevarria, the bank's lead director, said the company has been engaged in the CEO succession process for  a couple of years  and looked at internal and external candidates.  Once the bank settled on Scharf, Hassell said, the goal was to show he was CEO from his first day on the job.  There's nothing really sudden about it,  Hassell said.

The punitive measures could come against Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino Lopez and Socialist Party No. 2 Diosdado Cabello for alleged rights violations, the U.S. officials told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity. Their comments followed President Donald Trump's vow on Monday to take  strong and swift economic actions  if Maduro went ahead with the new body that would have power to rewrite Venezuela's constitution and supersede all institutions.   All options are on the table,  including possible measures against Venezuela's vital oil sector such as banning its crude imports to the United States, a senior Trump administration  official told reporters on a conference call. Washington is seeking to head off the July 30 vote for a Constituent Assembly that it sees as Maduro's effort to create a  full dictatorship,  the administration official said.  The heightened U.S. rhetoric against Venezuela's ruling Socialist Party has infuriated Maduro but also provided him with a nationalist rallying cry.

The Constituent Assembly should be abandoned ... The whole world is asking for that,  said Colombia's President Juan Manuel Santos. In his speech, Maduro condemned him and Brazil's President Michel Temer as  lackeys  of Washington.

Slideshow (11 Images)Individual sanctions could come within days or else be delayed until after the July 30 vote, but no final decisions have been made and such actions could still be put on hold, one U.S. official told Reuters. Tough oil-related sanctions could bankrupt the Maduro government and worsen grave food shortages in the crisis-hit OPEC nation. Hitting Venezuela's energy sector could also raise U.S. domestic gasoline prices. Venezuela is the third largest foreign oil supplier to the United States, after Canada and Saudi Arabia, exporting about 780,000 barrels per day of crude. Polls show the ruling Socialists would be thrashed in any conventional election in Venezuela. A majority of people oppose the Constituent Assembly, which critics have said is a sham election skewed to give Maduro a majority.  He insists it is the only way to bring peace after months of anti-government unrest that has killed 100 people and further crippled the economy. Maduro's opponents said they drew 7.5 million people onto the streets at the weekend to vote in a symbolic referendum where 98 percent disagreed with the assembly.   Protesters blockaded parts of Caracas on Tuesday and a national strike was called for Thursday.

The high court unanimously ruled in March that Kansas' school funding system fell short of the adequacy requirement, but gave the state until June 30 to come up with a remedy. Legislation for a two-year funding boost totaling $293 million by fiscal 2019 was enacted by Republican Governor Sam Brownback last month. The law was characterized as inadequate by lawyers representing school districts that sued the state.  In arguments before the court on Tuesday, justices raised concerns that the new law continued to fall short. Chief Justice Lawton Nuss questioned why lawmakers pushed aside a recommendation by the Kansas State Board of Education for a $893 million increase.  Aren't they the experts on education?  Nuss asked. Other justices raised concerns that the state's budget troubles may have put a cap on extra money for schools and that it could take years to determine the outcomes of the new funding formula on student achievement. Before deciding on a school funding fix, the legislature last month hiked income tax rates over Brownback's veto to address big budget gaps. Jeffrey King, a special assistant attorney general, told the court the amount of available revenue was  absolutely  a factor for the legislature, but only to ensure the law could meet its additional funding target.  There is new funding in this formula students will benefit from on day one,  King said.  Alan Rupe, an attorney for school districts, said the legislature chose to ignore the state board of education's recommendation and opted for a lower amount that  is not enough.   We believe the magnitude of the solution needs to meet the magnitude of the problem,  he told the court. Nuss gave no indication of when the court would issue a ruling. The lawsuit, which dates back to 2010, also resulted in a state supreme court ruling requiring Kansas to address funding disparities between rich and poor school districts.

In papers filed on Tuesday in U.S. bankruptcy court in San Juan, PREPA creditors said a receiver was needed to ensure the utility sets electricity rates high enough to service debt. Political appointees of Puerto Rico's Governor Ricardo Rossello, they argued, cannot be trusted to do so.  PREPA’s interests cannot be adequately served or protected if they are subjected to the whims of the governor's agenda,  said the creditors, which include bondholders such as Oppenheimer Funds and insurers like Assured Guaranty. A spokeswoman for Rossello had no immediate comment. The request is the latest chapter in the long saga of PREPA, the quasi-public power company. Hamstrung by outdated plants, PREPA has not raised rates in decades. Its plight is seen as a microcosm of broader trouble in Puerto Rico, the cash-strapped U.S. territory laden with $72 billion in debt and a 45 percent poverty rate, which earlier this year filed the largest bankruptcy in U.S. municipal history. PREPA and its bondholders began restructuring talks in 2014, reaching two deals that both fell apart. The first was rejected by Rossello, the second by Puerto Rico's federally-appointed financial oversight board, which expressed concern that rate hikes could hurt consumers and exacerbate Puerto Rico's woes. Puerto Rico residents already pay rates around twice the U.S. average, according to federal government data. Bondholders would have accepted 15 percent cuts to repayments in exchange for higher-rated bonds secured by a dedicated charge on customer bills. Unable to close the deal, Puerto Rico's government and oversight board pushed PREPA into bankruptcy earlier this month. The creditors argue that, under the 1941 law creating PREPA, the court is required to appoint a receiver if requested by at least a quarter of stakeholders, a threshold these creditors easily meet. Standing in the creditors' way, however, is the so-called automatic stay that bars creditors of PREPA from enforcing certain rights while the utility is in bankruptcy. The creditors argue in the court papers the stay should be lifted to avoid  irreparable harm.   PREPA's bondholders face a profound threat to the value of their collateral  absent the lifting of the stay, they argue.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/puertorico-debt-prepa-idUSL1N1K91OX"},

It’s not confined to the effect it will have on the British economy, even if that is likely to be major, nor on the adjustments the remaining 27 EU states must make.    There’s more than a little suspicion in the UK that the continental elites are enjoying the mess the Brits are in, unwillingly forced to accept the will of the people and struggling to get a grip on the complexities of separating trade, legal systems, financial and political commitments built up over 44 years. When a friendly country, especially one perceived as arrogant (a widespread view of the British establishment) enters a time of trouble, something inside its close allies quietly rejoices. We compete, after all, not just in trade and growth, but in our national self images.  But schadenfreude is hollow. Most Western countries now face, in differing degrees of intensity, the same issues that impelled a narrow majority to vote for Brexit last year. These are closely tied together: immigration, fear of terrorism, the sovereignty of national parliaments, embattled ethnic identity, and lack of community cohesion. They were summed up by the pro-Brexit camp as “Taking back control!” That concept doesn’t stop at the English Channel. Expect, in the next year, more pressure on the EU and national administrations fuelled by the same discontent that motivated Brexit. And in democracies, sooner or later, such discontent must take political forms.  More from Reuters Commentary  Howard Eissenstat: One year after failed coup, Turkey lurches toward dictatorship Scott Lemieux: Trump's plan to make voters older, wealthier and whiter Popular attitudes throughout Europe now appear to be increasingly out of kilter with those of the political and corporate leaderships. One index was a study of 10,000 Europeans across 10 EU states, published by foreign affairs think tank Chatham House showing that an average of 55 percent of those polled agreed with President Donald Trump’s efforts to ban citizens from several Muslim-majority states from entering the United States.   Another large study from the same source, published last month , showed that “there is simmering discontent within the public, large sections of whom view the EU in negative terms, want to see it return some powers to member states, and feel anxious over the effects of immigration. Only 34 percent of the public feel they have benefited from the EU, compared with 71 percent of the elite.”  Both Germany and Sweden have taken in large numbers of migrants, many of them desperate and poor. Sweden, the self-declared “humanitarian superpower,” which took the highest percentage of migrants relative to its population, now faces a backlash, especially since an Uzbek asylum seeker drove a van into a crowd, killing five, in Stockholm in April. The majority of Swedes now call for reduced migrant numbers; the anti-immigrant Swedish Democrats remain the country’s second most popular party and police have been directed to crack down on illegal immigrants. In Germany, numbers have been cut back sharply since nearly a million migrants were allowed entry last year, but attacks, often by far right groups, on migrant hostels and homes were running at nearly 10 per day.  In Italy, where most migrants surviving the dangerous crossing from ports in North Africa land – half a million in the last four years, with 13,000 lost at sea - opposition to immigration is growing steadily, with the NGOs that now rescue a third of those trying to cross to Europe blamed for encouraging the migration. A poll taken at the end of 2016 showed Italy to be the most anti-immigrant country in Europe, with 52 percent of Italians agreeing with the statement that, “there are so many foreigners living here that it doesn’t feel like home anymore.”  France wasn’t far behind, in second place, with 47 percent of those polled holding the same view.   Speakers at a London conference organized by the Henry Jackson Society this week noted that native populations can accept migrants without much conflict - but not if they arrive in sudden waves, not if they remain apart from the host citizens and not if they are also of a different ethnic group.  Erik Kaufmann, a politics professor at London’s Birkbeck College who spoke at the conference, has written that “the most important driver of majority attitudes is demography: the balance between ethnic change and integration.”    Those countries which cope best with diversity, such as Canada, actively encourage it. Ottawa’s official immigration website proclaims that “different backgrounds and cultures are not only accepted, they are encouraged. People are not expected to be one type - but can be made up of many different things and yet still be Canadian.” But Canada’s location means that Canada is not besieged by desperate migrants: it can, in the main, choose whom it allows in. Canada’s points-based immigration policy has, for some years, focused “on fueling economic prosperity,” placing “a high priority on finding people who have the skills and experience required to meet Canada’s economic needs.”   It is unlikely that this identification - of strong community bonds, sovereign politics (“taking back control!”) and immigration - is much different in the UK from elsewhere in the Western world. For the governing and other elites, the conclusion of the experts at the London conference was to cease to see all opponents to mass immigration and loss of national sovereignty as reactionaries - even though some will be - and to manage the issues at the pace that people can bear. These leaders should not see voter opposition to mass immigration and their support for national sovereignty as permanent, racially-based ill will. If most of our fellow citizens are of that mind, then we really are in trouble.

Lynch,US,OTC,ARBITRATION","sector":"Subjects","content":"(Reuters) - This could be the start of something huge: Securities and Exchange Commissioner Michael Piwowar said in a speech Monday to the Heritage Foundation that the SEC is open to the idea of allowing companies contemplating initial public offerings to include mandatory shareholder arbitration provisions in corporate charters. If Piwowar’s statements, first reported by my Reuters colleague Sarah Lynch, mark a new SEC policy on mandatory arbitration, they could be the beginning of the end of securities fraud class actions.  That’s a big if, of course. Mandatory arbitration of shareholder claims isn’t a new idea. In fact, as law professor Barbara Black has written, it’s been kicking around since the late 1980s, when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Shearson v. McMahon and a successor case that securities brokerages could enforce mandatory arbitration agreements with customers. I first wrote about the prospect of companies requiring shareholders to arbitrate their claims in 2013, after the Supreme Court ruled in American Express v. Italian Colors that arbitration agreements trump plaintiffs’ power to enforce statutory rights through class actions.  Despite that precedent, the SEC has long insisted that corporations cannot impose arbitration on shareholders because mandatory arbitration provisions would violate anti-waiver clauses in federal securities laws. The agency emphatically affirmed that position in two different contexts in 2012. When the private equity fund Carlyle floated the possibility of an individual shareholder arbitration clause as part of its initial public offering in early 2012, the SEC informed the fund that it would not accelerate its registration statement. Carlyle ended up dropping the mandatory arbitration provision.  Meanwhile, shareholders advised by University of Michigan law professor Adam Pritchard proposed bylaw amendments at three companies - Google, Pfizer and Gannett - that would have required shareholders to arbitrate federal securities claims. Pfizer and Gannett, according to Pritchard, sought to exclude the mandatory arbitration proposals from a shareholder vote. Pfizer asked the SEC to bless the exclusion. In response, the SEC agreed with Pfizer that “implementation of the proposal would cause the company to violate the federal securities laws.” (Google shareholders, according to Pritchard, voted down the mandatory arbitration proposal.)  So Piwowar’s comments to the conservative Heritage Foundation, encouraging companies to “come to us to ask for relief to put in mandatory arbitration into their charters,” seems to represent a different view of the law and public policy than the SEC has previously espoused. The SEC is operating with only three commissioners at the moment: Piwowar, who is a Republican, Republican chair Jay Clayton and Democratic commissioner Kara Stein.  It’s not clear whether Clayton is aligned with Piwowar on mandatory arbitration. As Sarah N. Lynch reported Monday, Clayton did not specifically mention the provisions in a speech last week about boosting IPOs. But the SEC chair did invite companies to petition the SEC for exemptions from disclosure requirements. Piwowar, according to Lynch’s account, put mandatory arbitration provisions into the same broad category of cooperation between the SEC and companies weighing whether to go public.  “This is important for the signal it’s sending,” said professor Adam Zimmerman of Loyola Law School. “Piwowar is sending up a flare – this might be okay with us.”  I talked to six securities law professors on Tuesday about the implications of mandatory shareholder arbitration provisions. Most said a pro-arbitration Supreme Court would likely uphold the legality of such provisions. And though Jill Fisch of the University of Pennsylvania suggested that state legislators might try to act to prohibit corporations from requiring shareholders to arbitrate disputes, much as Delaware lawmakers squelched loser-pays provisions in 2015, Michigan’s Pritchard said the Federal Arbitration Act would probably pre-empt a state law disfavoring arbitration.  If the SEC allows companies going public for the first time to require shareholder arbitration, companies that are already public won’t be far behind in imposing the requirement. And that, the profs agreed, will hamper shareholder class actions in state and federal court. If businesses can avoid securities class actions, they will.  It’s true that companies have not tried to defy the SEC and test their right to impose individual arbitration on shareholders. To the contrary: When Pritchard’s clients tried to bring mandatory arbitration proposals to shareholders, Pfizer and Gannett vetoed the proposals.  But Pritchard said SEC approval would change corporations’ calculus. “No one wants to be first,” he said. “No one wants to be the test case.”  If the SEC backs mandatory arbitration provisions, the only big impediment for corporations contemplating them would be market reaction. Will big institutional investors balk at waiving their right to sue? Columbia professor John Coffee predicted that the combination of non-voting shares and mandatory arbitration clauses would have a price impact on companies going public. But Penn prof Fisch said it might be hard for pension funds to steer clear of corporations with mandatory arbitration provisions because of index fund investments. Pritchard, as a supporter of the clauses, said he believes investors will pay more for shares of companies that don’t face the cost of defending securities class actions.  Law professors are divided on the policy consequences of forcing shareholders into individual arbitration. The primary policy question is deterrence: Are companies more likely to engage in misconduct if they don’t face the risk of accountability in the public forum of a courtroom?  New York University professor Jennifer Arlen told me they are. Arbitration, she said, is a private forum. “If you take shareholder suits out of the light of day and put them in a dark closet, you lose the deterrent effect,” she said. “The very reasons why some corporations would like the ability to require shareholders to arbitrate securities fraud claims are the reasons why it would be bad public policy to allow them to do so.”  Big investors will still have the means and motive to bring claims. They can afford the upfront costs of arbitration and their losses may justify individual proceedings. Michigan’s Pritchard said the risk of those individual arbitrations is enough to deter corporate misconduct.  But even if large institutional investors bring individual arbitrations against misbehaving corporations, said Boston University professor David Webber, author of the 2015 study Shareholder Litigation Without Class Actions, small shareholders would be left in the cold. “The SEC is supposed to be about shareholder protection,” Webber said. “To the extent possible, it should not be fostering policies that harm certain investors. The SEC is supposed to level the playing field.”  Piwowar’s comments are sure to spark more of the debate I’ve just touched upon here. Securities class actions survived their last existential crisis, when the Supreme Court reconsidered fraud on the market theory in 2014. Their next one may be in the offing.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-otc-arbitration-idUSKBN1A326T"},

Egypt faces an Islamist insurgency led by the Islamic State group in the Sinai Peninsula, where hundreds of soldiers and police have been killed since 2013. The statement said security forces conducted a raid on a building under construction in Arish, a city in North Sinai, where militants had set up a base of operations.  An ensuing firefight led to the death of one of the group's leaders, Ahmed Hassan Ahmed Al-Nashu, who is known as Ghandur Al-Masri, and the escape of another, the statement said. It said Masri was responsible for carrying out several operations and recruiting new members for Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis, a Sinai-based group which pledged allegiance to Islamic State in 2014. The Interior Ministry said earlier in the day that police had killed two prominent members of the Hasm Movement, which has claimed several attacks in Cairo over the past year, during a firefight in a suburb on the outskirts of the capital. Egypt this month saw one of the worst attacks on its security forces in years when 23 soldiers were killed after two suicide car bombs were detonated in North Sinai.

Albuquerque Police Department Officer Dominique Perez and now-retired Keith Sandy were charged with murder for shooting James Boyd, 38, at an illegal campsite. Their trial ended in a hung jury last year without further charges. A review by prosecutors showed there was not enough evidence to prove that Perez and Sandy violated Boyd's civil rights, the Justice Department said in a statement.  The evidence, when viewed as whole, indicates that the officers fired only after reasonably perceiving that Boyd posed a serious threat of physical harm to a fellow officer,  it said. Boyd, who the two officers knew had a history of mental illness and violent crime, was brandishing two knives and was close to a third officer when Perez and Sandy opened fire on him, according to the statement and prior trial testimony. Rock-throwing protests erupted after the shooting, which came at a time when the Justice Department was already investigating the Albuquerque police force over accusations of using force on civilians. Albuquerque officials agreed in 2015 to pay $5 million to Boyd's family to settle a wrongful death civil case. Shannon Kennedy, a lawyer for Boyd's family, said the relatives appreciated the investigation into the shooting by the Justice Department, the U.S. Attorney's Office and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.  His death galvanized the City of Albuquerque to make swift and lasting change within the City of Albuquerque police department that has no doubt saved lives,  she said in an emailed statement. Perez was fired from the police department after being charged in state court, but was later reinstated, the Albuquerque Journal reported.

Republican senators' effort to pass their own healthcare overhaul bill collapsed late on Monday, stoking doubts over the likelihood that Trump's pro-growth agenda would come to fruition. Traders also remained doubtful the Federal Reserve would be able to raise interest rates again this year, while other central banks including the European Central Bank and Bank of England have signaled a more hawkish bent toward tightening policy.   The setback for Trump is a setback for the U.S. dollar,  said Kathy Lien, managing director at BK Asset Management in New York.  Based upon the failed repeal of Obamacare, I think that really casts doubt on the Trump administration's broader strategies.  The euro touched $1.1583 EUR= against the dollar, its strongest since early May 2016, with analysts noting traders who had  shorted  or bet against the euro were being forced to  cover  or repurchase the currency.  A U.S. Dollar note is seen in this June 22, 2017 illustration photo.Thomas White/IllustrationThe euro's 0.7 percent increase, as of afternoon U.S. trading, last put it on course for its biggest one-day percentage gain in three weeks.   The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, touched its lowest level since early September 2016 of 94.476 .DXY.  An illustration picture shows euro coins, April 8, 2017.Kai PfaffenbachThe dollar touched 0.9525 franc CHF=, its lowest against the Swiss currency since late June 2016, while the dollar hit a three-week low against the Japanese yen of 111.69 yen JPY=.  The dollar index has fallen 7.4 percent since the start of the year, partly on the doubts over Trump's fiscal stimulus agenda, with much of the downdraft starting in early March. The Australian dollar was a beneficiary of the greenback's weakness on Tuesday and surged to a more than two-year high of $0.7942 AUD=D4.   This is a tremendous short squeeze in the euro on the break of $1.15, and that has resulted in a significant rally as shorts bail out of their positions,  said Douglas Borthwick, managing director at Chapdelaine Foreign Exchange in New York. Friday's weak reading on U.S. inflation and retail sales fanned speculation the Fed may not have justification for another rate hike by the end of this year, despite policymakers' projection for such a move.

Lockheed's net income rose nearly 5 percent to $942 million, or $3.23 per share, in the second quarter, helping the company nudge its full-year profit forecast higher.  U.S. demand for F-35 jets has increased with the Pentagon announcing on July 10 that it would add 13 jets to its planned purchase of F-35s, but a detailed delivery schedule was not released. Chief Executive Officer Marillyn Hewson told analysts on a conference call,  As you can see just with what's in the budget deliberations right now, with the adds that are coming forward on the F-35 for the various services ... we will still see potentially some upside.  Hewson is aiming to win a portion of six or seven multi-billion dollar contracts that are scheduled to be awarded this year, such as the new Air Force training jet, and a renewal of an $8 billion dollar logistics and maintenance contract to support U.S. special forces.  Net sales rose to $12.69 billion from $11.58 billion a year ago. Analysts expected $3.11 per share on revenue of $12.40 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Lockheed raised its 2017 profit forecast to $12.30 to $12.60 per share, up from its forecast of $12.15 to $12.45 last quarter, but only 5 cents higher than the outlook it gave in January.  The company also raised its 2017 sales forecast to $49.8 billion to $51 billion, from $49.5 billion to $50.7 billion. The stock settled at $287.81, down 0.2 percent, after hitting a new high of $292.54 early in the session.

Trump promised during his election campaign to spend more on defense, and this has buoyed defense companies' stock prices. Lockheed sells security and intelligence products including ships, planes, and missile systems to the U.S. intelligence community, the military and NASA. The U.S. government was about 70 percent of Lockheed's revenue in 2016. The company has been working to grow its international  customer base which accounted for 27 percent of revenue last year. Lockheed said sales at aeronautics, its largest segment, which makes the F-35 fighter jet and C-130 planes, rose 19.4 percent during the quarter. The U.S. Department of Defense said on July 10 it plans to purchase 2,456 F-35 jets, up from 2,443. The price of the F-35 varies, but the 13 additional jets will all be the B-model, capable of short take-offs and vertical landings and used by the Marine Corps and the British Navy, and currently cost more than $120 million each. The program, as it is currently outlined, would deliver the final jets in fiscal 2044 and have a total cost of more than a trillion dollars over its projected life.  The F-35 program is the Pentagon's costliest arms program and has been criticized by Trump and other U.S. officials for being too expensive. Last quarter the Bethesda, Maryland-based weapons maker cut its earnings-per-share estimates for the first time in seven years following a one-time charge of 39 cents per share.     Lockheed bought back $500 million worth of shares and also distributed $525 million in dividends to shareholders. This represented 81 percent of the free cash flow from the quarter.

Paris is in competition with Los Angeles to host the 2024 games. Hildalgo has repeatedly said she intends to see Olympic swimmers use the river that snakes around Notre Dame Cathedral and past the Eiffel Tower should Paris be victorious.  This opens that door to open water swimming in Paris,  Hidalgo said at the opening of the canal water pools, sectioned off and filtered in the Bassin de la Villette, a wide section of canal in the north of the city.  Thanks to the Olympic Games we'll be able to see to it that the water in the Seine is clean water.  A Triathlon open water swim was held in the Seine in 2011, but a competition scheduled for 2012 was abandoned partly because of health worries. Casual bathing in the Paris section of the Seine was outlawed in 1923 and swimmers are a rare sight, even on the hottest days of the year. When he was mayor of Paris in 1990, former French president Jacques Chirac pledged to make the Seine clean again and said he would swim in the river himself in three years time. There is no record that he kept that promise, but progress has been made. Some species of fish absent for decades are now back, and Celia Blauel, a Paris city environment official, told Les Echos newspaper last week that the river was already clean enough to swim in on some days in the year.

But the events of May 1940 that Christopher Nolan explores in  Dunkirk  is a  very suspenseful, thrilling tale that isn't necessarily one that fits in exactly and neatly into films that you've seen before,  the British director told Reuters.  Dunkirk,  out in theaters on Friday, recounts the evacuation by civilians and military of some 400,000 British and Allied soldiers stranded on the desolate French beach of Dunkirk, across the English Channel port of Dover. Unlike other war films that detail the violence of battle, Nolan opted to minimize the bloodshed and create  a different kind of suspense rather than gore and horror, because that causes people to avert their eyes.    There have been many brilliant films that show blood and gore and all kinds of repulsive aspects of war,  Nolan said.      We wanted to give people a rather different experience of what the intensity might be.  To achieve that effect, Nolan cuts between three perspectives - the battle in the skies, the armada of civilians sailing across the Channel in small boats, and the stranded soldiers desperately trying to escape. FILE PHOTO: Director Christopher Nolan and Emma Thomas arrive for the world premiere of Dunkirk in London, Britain, July 13, 2017.Peter NichollsCritics have given rave reviews to  Dunkirk.  Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter called it an  impressionist masterpiece,  while Chris Nashawaty of Entertainment Weekly said the film  is visceral, big-budget filmmaking that can be called Art.  The restrained violence of  Dunkirk  is not the only difference Nolan brings to the traditional war film. Slideshow (6 Images)Rather than focus on the stories of individuals, like Steven Spielberg's 1998 World War Two epic  Saving Private Ryan,  or Mel Gibson's 2016 film  Hacksaw Ridge,  Nolan said he wanted  Dunkirk  to convey communal heroism rather than individual acts. While the film stars big names like Kenneth Branagh, Tom Hardy and Mark Rylance, Nolan held open casting calls to find young new faces, led by 20-year-old newcomer Fionn Whitehead as Tommy, a scrappy, traumatized soldier fighting to survive. He is joined by 23-year-old singer Harry Styles, formerly of boy band One Direction, who makes his film debut in  Dunkirk  and has received praise for his performance.   It's not a war movie that's for history buffs who love war movies. I feel like it's a very emotional story, it's very intimate. You're in with the characters from the very start and it's kind of scary at times and intense to watch,  Styles said.

Yields on the 5-year, 7-year, and 10-year notes, which move inversely to prices, dropped to three-week lows, while those on the 30-year bond slid to their lowest in two weeks. Republican efforts to overhaul or repeal Obamacare collapsed in the U.S. Senate on Tuesday, dealing a sharp setback to President Donald Trump and the Republican Party's seven-year quest to kill President Barack Obama's signature healthcare law.  It does add some uncertainty as to whether the administration and a cooperative Congress is able to push through with priorities that was communicated in the election period,  said Bill Northey, chief investment officer at U.S. Bank Private Client Group in Helena, Montana. Investors fretted about the growing division within Trump's Republican party that has hampered the administration's legislative policy goals. But Northey said persistently low inflation has been a major driver for the slide in yields the last two weeks.  Inflation has not materialized in the way that the Fed anticipated and it hasn't manifested in labor costs, commodities, or core inflation,  Northey said. Weak inflation was again evident in Tuesday's economic data, which showed U.S. import prices falling for a second straight month in June as the cost of petroleum products declined further. In late trading, U.S. 10-year yields fell to 2.266 percent from 2.309 percent late Monday. Yields earlier hit a three-week low of 2.259 percent. DRW Trading market strategist Lou Brien said the drop below the key 2.30 percent yield on the 10-year was a significant technical indicator that suggested further Treasuries buying. The next key level for 10-year yields would be 2.25 percent, he added. U.S. 30-year bonds yielded 2.854 percent, from 2.893 percent on Monday. Those yields earlier touched a two-week low of 2.849 percent. U.S. two-year yields were down at 1.351 percent from Monday's 1.36 percent. The yield curve continued to flatten on Tuesday, with the spread between five-year and 30-year yields narrowing to 103.50 basis points. The same was true for the spread between U.S. two-year and 10-year notes, with the gap shrinking to 90.50 basis points , the tightest in two weeks. The spread was last at 91.60 basis points. In general, a flat yield curve reflects expectations that inflation will decline.

Investors are keenly sensitive to food-safety issues at Chipotle, which is still working to recover fully from a string of sales-crushing E. coli, salmonella and norovirus outbreaks in late 2015. Chipotle's stock was off 6.4 percent, or $23.41, at $368.60 at midday on Tuesday. The shares were trading at nearly $750 prior to the company's previous food-safety incidents. Chipotle spokesman Chris Arnold said on Tuesday the reported symptoms are consistent with norovirus, a highly contagious virus that can cause severe vomiting and diarrhea.  We plan to reopen the restaurant today,  Arnold said. The suspected illnesses were first reported by Business Insider earlier on Tuesday. It cited information from iwaspoisoned.com, a website on which consumers document what they believe are incidents of foodborne illness.  In total, eight reports were made to the website, indicating that at least 13 customers fell sick after eating there from July 14-15,  the news site said. Chipotle voluntarily closed the restaurant on Monday, said Victor Avitto, environmental health supervisor for the Loudoun County Public Health Department, which has jurisdiction over the restaurant on Tripleseven Road in Sterling.

The home team will instead pick from four primary uniforms to be worn at all home games and visiting teams will choose a contrasting uniform within their own assortment.  White 'Association' uniforms will replace the typical home jersey, while the 'Icon' version uses the team's primary color and replaces the road uniforms.  Nike, which has replaced Adidas as the NBA's uniform supplier, will reveal the two remaining uniforms in the coming months.  The world's No. 1 footwear maker said on Tuesday that it employed 3D-body maps of players, including heat and sweat maps, to design cooler, lighter uniforms for players to wear during the NBA's grueling 82-game season.  NBA players tested early versions of the uniforms and provided feedback that prompted Nike to evolve the designs in ways that included moving the armhole, neck and side seams to eliminate distractions for athletes, the company said.  An undated handout illustration of the four new editions of Nike's game uniforms for the NBA's 2017-18 season.Nike/Handout The mental advantage of a quality uniform is priceless,  Cavaliers guard Kyrie Irving said in a press release.   The fact that Nike listened to all of our feedback while developing the new NBA uniforms speaks volumes. I'm excited for the new fit and feel,  he said.  The most significant change comes to the back shoulder of the uniform where Nike designers altered the construction for an improved fit, the company said. The uniform is comprised of a combination of Alpha Yarns and recycled polyester, with each athlete uniform representing approximately 20 recycled PET (polyethylene terephthalate) bottles.   Not only does this yarn blend match Nike's broad commitment to sustainability, it also removes moisture more quickly than previous NBA uniforms, wicking sweat 30-percent faster than current NBA uniforms,  Nike said in a release.  Nike will also unveil new tights and socks to complement the uniforms and provide a seamless look for the athletes, it said.

A rebound in refining margins and cash gasoline prices marked the first sign of sustained strength during the crucial summer driving season after demand got off to a slow start in 2017 and high inventories kept prices low. U.S. gasoline margins rose for a third straight session on Tuesday. The crack spread hit a session high of $20.18 a barrel, highest since April 12.  Gasoline futures also rallied, hitting a high of $1.5926 a gallon, highest since June 2. Cash gasoline prices in the New York Harbor region hit a high for the year on Tuesday, trading about 2 cents above benchmark futures, traders said. Philadelphia Energy Solutions' 330,000 barrel-per-day refining complex, the largest on the East Coast, cut production modestly while it repairs a boiler associated with its 90,000 bpd gasoline-making unit at the Girard Point section of the complex. The boiler is expected to restart next week. The refinery also saw a pump fire Monday night at the 55,000 bpd crude unit in the same section of the plant, but it was unclear on Tuesday whether the unit was shut. PES did not respond to a request for comment. PBF Energy shut a 43,000-bpd catalytic reformer at its Delaware City, Delaware, refinery on Monday for up to 10 days of planned work. The company declined comment. That work comes as Gulf Coast refineries send fewer refined products up the Colonial Pipeline, the vital artery that supplies the U.S. Southeast and East Coast markets, as exporting to Latin America is currently more lucrative.  A lot less coming up the Colonial is really tightening things,  said one trader.  Imports have also declined in recent weeks. The current four-week average of total motor gasoline imports into PADD 1, or the East Coast is 597,000 bpd, 18 percent lower than last year, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.  Gasoline inventories in the New York harbor fell by about 46,000 barrels last week, traders who saw data from market intelligence firm Genscape said on Tuesday. East Coast gasoline inventories have fallen below five-year highs, even though overall U.S. gasoline inventories are six percent above the five-year average. Analysts polled by Reuters forecast overall U.S. stockpiles of gasoline fell 700,000 barrels last week.

A six-day trial in the State Court of Chatham County concluded late Monday with the jury unanimously agreeing on the civil award to the family of Sarah Jones, according to the court records. Jones was killed when a moving train hit props and equipment staged on a railroad bridge and trestle south of Savannah for the never-completed film  Midnight Rider,  about Allman, who died in May. After the award, her parents, Richard and Elizabeth Jones, said they had spent more than three years trying to understand how their daughter lost her life.  That search has now come to a close,  they said in a statement. Railroad operator CSX Corp, which owns the tracks, is responsible for $3.9 million of the liability, according to court records. The company said it will appeal the verdict.  CSX is deeply sympathetic to the terrible loss suffered by the family of Ms. Sarah Jones, but respectfully disagrees with the conclusions reached by the jury,  CSX spokesman Rob Doolittle said on Tuesday. Jacksonville, Florida-based CSX has maintained that the movie production company failed to secure permits to use the tracks for filming. Filmmaker Randall Miller previously settled with the family and spent about a year in jail after pleading guilty in 2015 to involuntary manslaughter and trespassing stemming from the crash, court records show. He was sentenced to two years in county jail and eight years probation and fined $20,000. All criminal charges against Jody Savin, Miller's wife and business partner, were dropped. Jeff Harris, a lawyer for the Jones family, said relatives have had closure.  This has been cathartic for them,  Harris said, adding that the family has established a nonprofit group,  Safety for Sarah,  dedicated to promoting safety on movie sets. In addition to CSX's liability, the award included the following payments, according to court documents: --$3.14 million from Randall Miller. --$2 million from Rayonier Performance Fibers LLC, which owned the land where the tracks were located; --$785,000 from Savin; --$785,000 from movie set employee Hillary Schwartz; --$561,000 from movie set employee Jay Serdish. Schwartz was identified as the film's first assistant director and Serdish as executive producer/unit production manager, according to the Deadline Headline website. It was not immediately clear whether the award reflected the settlements previously agreed by Miller and Savin, or whether it added to their liability.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-georgia-lawsuit-idUSL1N1K91JN"},

A six-day trial in the State Court of Chatham County concluded late Monday with the jury unanimously agreeing on the civil award to the family of Sarah Jones, according to the court records. Jones was killed when a moving train hit props and equipment staged on a railroad bridge and trestle south of Savannah for the never-completed film  Midnight Rider,  about Allman, who died in May. After the award, her parents, Richard and Elizabeth Jones, said they had spent more than three years trying to understand how their daughter lost her life.   That search has now come to a close,  they said in a statement. Railroad operator CSX Corp, which owns the tracks, is responsible for $3.9 million of the liability, according to court records. The company said it will appeal the verdict.  CSX is deeply sympathetic to the terrible loss suffered by the family of Ms. Sarah Jones, but respectfully disagrees with the conclusions reached by the jury,  CSX spokesman Rob Doolittle said on Tuesday.  Jacksonville, Florida-based CSX has maintained that the movie production company failed to secure permits to use the tracks for filming. Filmmaker Randall Miller previously settled with the family and spent about a year in jail after pleading guilty in 2015 to involuntary manslaughter and trespassing stemming from the crash, court records show.  He was sentenced to two years in county jail and eight years probation and fined $20,000. All criminal charges against Jody Savin, Miller's wife and business partner, were dropped. Jeff Harris, a lawyer for the Jones family, said relatives have had closure.  This has been cathartic for them,  Harris said, adding that the family has established a nonprofit group,  Safety for Sarah,  dedicated to promoting safety on movie sets. In addition to CSX's liability, the award included the following payments, according to court documents: --$3.14 million from Randall Miller. --$2 million from Rayonier Performance Fibers LLC, which owned the land where the tracks were located; --$785,000 from Savin; --$785,000 from movie set employee Hillary Schwartz;  --$561,000 from movie set employee Jay Serdish. Schwartz was identified as the film's first assistant director and Serdish as executive producer/unit production manager, according to the Deadline Headline website.  It was not immediately clear whether the award reflected the settlements previously agreed by Miller and Savin, or whether it added to their liability.

Under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) hospitals got financial incentives to reduce the number of patients readmitted within 30 days of going home, a policy designed to reward higher quality care. But the fear was that hospitals might lower readmission rates by delaying needed follow-up care to avoid penalties, said lead study author Dr. Kumar Dharmarajan, a researcher at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut.  We actually found the opposite,  Dharmarajan, also chief scientific officer at Clover Health, a San Francisco-based health insurance startup company, said by email.  Hospitals with greater readmission rate reductions tended to have greater reductions in mortality after discharge, and this relationship grew even stronger when we examined 90-day mortality rates rather than 30-day mortality rates after discharge.  Nationwide, the ACA has led to reductions in 30-day readmission rates for heart failure, heart attacks and pneumonia, all common reasons for older adults to wind up in the hospital, researchers note in JAMA.  For the current study, researchers examined data on readmission rates for patients 65 and older insured by Medicare from 2008 to 2014. The study included 2.96 million heart failure admissions, 1.23 million admissions for heart attacks and 2.54 million pneumonia admissions.  Patients were typically in their late 70s or early 80s and had average hospital stays of about five days. Researchers adjusted readmission and mortality rates to account for patient age, sex, other medical conditions, season and the duration of the hospital stay.  At the start of the study period in January 2008, about 25 percent of heart failure patients were readmitted to the hospital within 30 days of discharge and 8.4 percent died.  With heart attacks, 19 percent of patients were readmitted within 30 days and 7.6 percent died. For pneumonia, the 30-day readmission rate was 18 percent and the mortality rate was 8.5 percent.  By the end of the study period in 2014, readmission rates declined slightly for all three conditions.  These decreases were also associated with a small but statistically meaningful decline in 30-day mortality rates, the study found.  However, the study isn't a controlled experiment designed to prove that reducing readmissions will directly cause lower death rates, the authors note. It also focused only on three conditions and admissions for older adults, and results might be different with other health problems or younger patients.  Even so, the authors conclude, the results make it unlikely that reducing readmission rates could lead to an rise in mortality rates.   The things that hospitals are generally doing to reduce readmissions are things like hiring discharge coordinators, scheduling early follow-up visits or using electronic functionalities to share information with outpatient providers,  said Dr. Karen Joynt Maddox, a researcher at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis and author of an accompanying editorial.  These are all patient-centered things that are unlikely to have negative consequences in terms of mortality,  Maddox said by email.  Even though some in the medical community have expressed concerns that efforts to lower readmissions might give doctors an incentive to inappropriately keep patients out of the hospital who need to return for additional care, the study offers fresh evidence that this doesn't happen, said Dr. Karl Bilimoria, director of the Surgical Outcomes and Quality Improvement Center at Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago.  While some may suggest this, most of us have not given this argument credence - doctors will still do the right thing and readmit patients when it is medically needed,  Bilimoria, who wasn't involved in the study, said by email.   In this case, the right thing to do is the easy thing,  Bilimoria said.  You can't manage a complex patient with a serious deterioration in their condition in the outpatient setting.

In papers filed on Tuesday in U.S. bankruptcy court in San Juan, PREPA creditors said a receiver was needed to ensure the utility sets electricity rates high enough to service debt. Political appointees of Puerto Rico's Governor Ricardo Rossello, they argued, cannot be trusted to do so.  PREPA’s interests cannot be adequately served or protected if they are subjected to the whims of the governor's agenda,  said the creditors, which include bondholders such as  Oppenheimer Funds and insurers like Assured Guaranty. A spokeswoman for Rossello had no immediate comment. The request is the latest chapter in the long saga of PREPA, the quasi-public power company.  Hamstrung by outdated plants, PREPA has not raised rates in decades. Its plight is seen as a microcosm of broader trouble in Puerto Rico, the cash-strapped U.S. territory laden with $72 billion in debt and a 45 percent poverty rate, which earlier this year filed the largest bankruptcy in U.S. municipal history. PREPA and its bondholders began restructuring talks in 2014, reaching two deals that both fell apart. The first was rejected by Rossello, the second by Puerto Rico's federally-appointed financial oversight board, which expressed concern that rate hikes could hurt consumers and exacerbate Puerto Rico's woes. Puerto Rico residents already pay rates around twice the U.S. average, according to federal government data.  Bondholders would have accepted 15 percent cuts to repayments in exchange for higher-rated bonds secured by a dedicated charge on customer bills.  Unable to close the deal, Puerto Rico's government and oversight board pushed PREPA into bankruptcy earlier this month. The creditors argue that, under the 1941 law creating PREPA, the court is required to appoint a receiver if requested by at least a quarter of stakeholders, a threshold these creditors easily meet. Standing in the creditors' way, however, is the so-called automatic stay that bars creditors of PREPA from enforcing certain rights while the utility is in bankruptcy. The creditors argue in the court papers the stay should be lifted to avoid  irreparable harm.   PREPA's bondholders face a profound threat to the value of their collateral  absent the lifting of the stay, they argue.

The proposed class-action complaint said Uber engaged in  pervasive and ongoing discrimination  because people in wheelchairs can use only a few dozen of its more than 58,000 vehicles in the city. Given Uber's growing popularity, this  substantially undermines  the benefits of New York City's commitment to make half its yellow taxis wheelchair-accessible by 2020, according to the complaint filed in the state Supreme Court in Manhattan.  I want to be treated like everybody else,  Valerie Joseph, 41, a Queens Village, New York resident born with spina bifida with hydrocephalus and one of the plaintiffs, said in an interview.  We are normal people, and we have lives.  In a statement, Uber said its technology  has expanded access to reliable transportation  for people with disabilities, and that it  will continue advocating for a solution that offers affordable, reliable transportation to those who need a wheelchair accessible vehicle.  The complaint said Uber provides wheelchair-accessible rides through its UberWAV service, but fewer than 100 vehicles in its city fleet offer it. It seeks to require Uber to provide  full and equal access  for people who need accessible transportation.  Riders either face very long wait times or can't get rides at all,  Rebecca Serbin, a staff attorney for Disability Rights Advocates, said in an interview.  The human rights law reflects the City Council's commitment to accessibility. Uber is flagrantly violating that law.  The case follows similar lawsuits against Uber in Chicago and Washington, D.C. It adds to problems affecting the San Francisco-based company, which has been beset by complaints about its workplace culture, a federal inquiry into software to help drivers avoid police, and an intellectual property lawsuit by Waymo, the self-driving car unit of Google parent Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O). The plaintiffs in Tuesday's lawsuit also include the Brooklyn Center for Independence for the Disabled, Disabled in Action of Metropolitan New York, the Taxis for All Campaign, and Brooklyn resident Gabriela Amari. Joseph, who works at the Axis Project gym in Manhattan, said that without Uber, she sometimes has to book rides on accessible buses or trains in advance, and the rides can take hours.

U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska's 89-page decision is a victory for Sony Corp, Vivendi SA's Universal Music Group, Warner Music Group and various affiliates in the 11-year-old lawsuit, which the judge said has been delayed by extensive disputes over evidence. Consumers accused the defendants of taking unfair advantage of their 80 percent share of the U.S. market for online music, and that by making such music  less attractive  to buy were able to drive up CD prices. But the judge said individual questions would  quickly overwhelm  issues common to the potential millions of people who could be represented in a nationwide class action. She said this was particularly true given the likelihood that a  significant percentage  of potential class members might have  unclean hands  because they downloaded music illegally.  As defendants have stated succinctly during this litigation, 'a plaintiff may not complain that one hand is being overcharged while the other hand is robbing the store,'  Preska wrote. Lawyers for the plaintiffs did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Class actions let plaintiffs pursue claims in groups and potentially obtain larger recoveries than if they were forced to sue individually, which can prove too expensive. The judge also refused to certify nine separate damages classes for consumers from eight U.S. states and the District of Columbia, saying differences among states' laws would make class action litigation  unmanageable.

The dollar sank to a 10-month low against a basket of currencies, making dollar-denominated metals cheaper for holders of other currencies, which could boost demand.            The greenback sank on reduced confidence in U.S. President Donald Trump's agenda and jitters over hawkish central banks abroad.

U.S. gold futures         settled 0.7 percent to $1,241.90.      The Senate's failure to repeal Obamacare has amplified concerns that the Trump economic agenda will be more difficult to implement  even though the GOP holds a tenuous majority in Congress,  said Tai Wong, director of base and precious metals trading for BMO Capital Markets in New York.      That is pressuring U.S. yields and driving the dollar towards year-long lows which creates a positive environment for gold, which has rallied steadily.       Data from consultancy GFMS shows India's gold imports climbed to an estimated 75 tonnes in June from 22.7 tonnes a year earlier. For the first half of the year imports rose to 514 tonnes, up 161 percent year on year.                  GFMS analysts said the jump was caused by Indian consumers buying ahead of July's increase in the goods and services tax on gold to 3 percent from 1.2 percent.      We see gold averaging around $1,300 over the third quarter,  said ING commodities strategist Warren Patterson.       Indian imports are rising after the very poor year last year. We expect that trend to continue even with the tax changes.       Weighing on the dollar is also doubt that the Federal Reserve would be able to raise interest rates again this year, while other central banks including the European Central Bank and Bank of England have signaled a more hawkish bent toward tightening policy.     A move above technical resistance at $1,250 could potentially see gold move back to the $1,280-90 highs that was  seen twice this year, especially with the Fed certain to be cautious at the July meeting, Wong said.     High interest rates would reduce demand for non-interest bearing gold.     However, investors are still retreating from physical gold. Holdings of SPDR Gold Trust      , the world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, slipped to 827.07 tonnes on Monday, down from 828.84 tonnes on Friday.               Meanwhile the price of silver        gained 1.4 percent to $16.29 an ounce after touching a two-week high at $16.34.      The Gold/Silver ratio hit a 15-month high on July 7 and total silver ETF holdings have since increased by over 2 percent, RBC Capital Markets said in a note.        We view the acceleration of inflows into physical silver ETFs as a positive sign fundamentally, and expect ongoing inflows as we enter a seasonally strong period for precious metals during Q3 ahead of the Indian festive period in October.      Platinum        gained 0.7 percent to $927.5 while palladium        slipped by 0.02 percent to $864.85.

The investment is the largest specific project announcement since March in Vaca Muerta, one of the world's largest shale formations, as Argentine President Mauricio Macri's government tries to reduce reliance on gas imports that have strained Argentina's finances. The provincial government in Neuquen, where Vaca Muerta is located, has agreed to split the Aguada Pichana area into two parts and is also combining it with the Aguada de Castro area, according to a statement. Total will operate the eastern part of Aguada Pichana with a 41 percent stake, where 48 horizontal wells will be drilled through 2021, up from 12 currently. Pan American Energy will operate the western part as well as Aguada de Castro with a 45 percent stake and plans to drill 24 horizontal wells. The investments will double natural gas production in the area to 4.5 million cubic meters per day, up from 2.2 million cubic meters per day currently, Neuquen Governor Omar Gutierrez said at a news conference. Pan American Energy Executive Director Marcos Bulgheroni said lower logistics costs were still needed but added that  the development of Vaca Muerta is on a path of no return.  The partners had already invested $500 million in the areas between 2014 and 2016. In March, Argentina's Tecpetrol, part of the Techint Group, said it would invest $2.3 billion in the Vaca Muerta shale fields through 2019, marking the biggest announcement related to the formation in years. That investment came after the government said it would gradually lower the price it guarantees for gas drilled from new wells, currently $7.50 per million British thermal units of gas, to encourage investment sooner rather than later. Vaca Muerta contains 308 trillion cubic feet of shale gas and 16.2 billion barrels of shale oil, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

J&J;, which reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings and raised its full-year profit forecast on Tuesday, is banking on newer pharmaceuticals to counter slowing demand for some of its older, best-selling products, including Remicade treatment and diabetes drug Invokana. J&J;'s shares were up 1.9 percent at $134.61 in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Chief Executive Alex Gorsky said that when drugs add months or years to patient lives and make significant differences on health outcomes, as with multiple myeloma treatment Darzalex and leukemia drug Imbruvica, the company has experienced less pricing pressure. Pharmaceutical companies have come under pressure to cut prices from insurers and the federal government. J&J; is one of several companies that has said it will keep annual price increases mostly below 10 percent. President Donald Trump has said that he will work to bring down drug prices. J&J; is the first among major pharmaceutical companies to release quarterly results, and the report comes a day after a Republican effort to pass healthcare legislation in the Senate collapsed. Gorsky is in Washington, D.C., meeting with U.S. and global leaders to discuss health care related issues. Excluding special items, the maker of everything from drugs, to medical prodcuts to consumer products including Band-Aids earned $1.83 per share in the second quarter, beating analysts' estimates by 3 cents. While sales in J&J;'s consumer and medical device divisions rose, sales for pharmaceutical products - its largest business - fell marginally to $8.6 billion.

In papers filed on Tuesday in U.S. bankruptcy court in San Juan, PREPA creditors said a receiver was needed to ensure the utility sets electricity rates high enough to service debt. Political appointees of Puerto Rico's Governor Ricardo Rossello, they argued, cannot be trusted to do so.  PREPA’s interests cannot be adequately served or protected if they are subjected to the whims of the governor's agenda,  said the creditors, which include bondholders such as  Oppenheimer Funds and insurers like Assured Guaranty. A spokeswoman for Rossello had no immediate comment. The request is the latest chapter in the long saga of PREPA, the quasi-public power company.  Hamstrung by outdated plants, PREPA has not raised rates in decades. Its plight is seen as a microcosm of broader trouble in Puerto Rico, the cash-strapped U.S. territory laden with $72 billion in debt and a 45 percent poverty rate, which earlier this year filed the largest bankruptcy in U.S. municipal history. PREPA and its bondholders began restructuring talks in 2014, reaching two deals that both fell apart. The first was rejected by Rossello, the second by Puerto Rico's federally-appointed financial oversight board, which expressed concern that rate hikes could hurt consumers and exacerbate Puerto Rico's woes. Puerto Rico residents already pay rates around twice the U.S. average, according to federal government data.  Bondholders would have accepted 15 percent cuts to repayments in exchange for higher-rated bonds secured by a dedicated charge on customer bills.  Unable to close the deal, Puerto Rico's government and oversight board pushed PREPA into bankruptcy earlier this month. The creditors argue that, under the 1941 law creating PREPA, the court is required to appoint a receiver if requested by at least a quarter of stakeholders, a threshold these creditors easily meet. Standing in the creditors' way, however, is the so-called automatic stay that bars creditors of PREPA from enforcing certain rights while the utility is in bankruptcy. The creditors argue in the court papers the stay should be lifted to avoid  irreparable harm.   PREPA's bondholders face a profound threat to the value of their collateral  absent the lifting of the stay, they argue.

Scott will take over as chairman of the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission, or CRTC, on Sept. 5, the federal government said in a statement. Scott has served as vice president of government relations for Telus Corp, one of Canada's biggest wireless companies and a provider of landline phone, internet and video services. He was most recently executive director of government and regulatory affairs at satellite communications company Telesat Holdings Inc. He has also previously worked at both the CRTC and the Competition Bureau. A consumer rights group said that Scott's appointment may shift the CRTC's focus away from the consumer-friendly policy direction it had under its former chairman, career bureaucrat Jean-Pierre Blais, whose five-year term ended last month. Canadians  will undoubtedly be disheartened  to see the Trudeau government place someone from industry into the top decision-making position while millions are relying on the CRTC to help render more affordable internet services, said OpenMedia's Meghan Sali. A group representing independent media production companies called on the government to fill two remaining CRTC vacancies with people with a background in their industry.  Over the course of its nearly 50-year history, the CRTC has never had a single commissioner from the independent production sector; this gap must be addressed to ensure effective regulation of the entire industry,” said Reynolds Mastin, head of the Canadian Media Producers Association. Along with the appointment of Scott, the government also named Caroline Simard as vice chair of broadcasting at the regulator, effective Sept. 11. Simard had been legal counsel at the Department of Innovation, Science and Economic Development since 2007 and before that worked for the United Nations' telecom agency. A search to fill the vacant post of vice chair for telecommunications will be launched soon, with Christianne Laizner named to fill the role for up to a year in the interim, it said. Judith LaRocque, a career civil servant in Canada, has served as interim CRTC chair since Blais' departure.

In the sprint to the line he edged out Edvald Boasson Hagen (Dimension Data) and Degenkolb (Trek-Segafredo), who clashed with Matthews as the riders came to a stop, accusing him of veering towards him on the high-speed dash for the line.  He grabbed me by the neck. The officials saw that. I don't know what they're going to do about it,  Matthews who is second in the race for the green points jersey, behind Kittel, said.  It was not very sportsmanlike.  Degenkolb gesticulated at Matthews as the pair crossed the line, appearing to indicate that he felt the Australian had pushed him dangerously close to the barriers.

In March, the same court ordered the roughly $20 million in Venezuelan oil to be held until state-run Sovcomflot's claim for $30 million in unpaid shipping fees is decided in a pending action by a British admiralty court. PDVSA rejects the claim.  Proceeds from the oil sale must be deposited into an escrow account at a Dutch or Antillian bank until the two sides reach a final agreement, the court said.  The crude has been stored at a rented facility on the neighboring island of St. Eustatius, but Sovcomflot requested the oil be sold to a third party, arguing there was no guarantee that the crude would be insured while at the terminal.  The Court of First Instance condemns PDVSA to cooperate on sale by ship owners of the cargo oil... to the best possible terms, including as high a price as possible,  said the order dated July 7 and seen this week. PDVSA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  The court action suggests even political allies of Venezuela such as Russia are losing patience with PDVSA's payment delays. The Venezuelan company's obsolete tankers are struggling to export oil and supply fuel to its domestic market. The court absolved PDVSA of trial costs but said it must pay a penalty of $500,000 per day up to a maximum of $5 million if it fails to comply with the ruling.  It was unclear when the penalty would begin. A PDVSA source said the company would auction the oil as soon as possible.  PDVSA in October sent the cargo on tanker NS Columbus to St. Eustatius, planning to sell the crude from there. But the owner of the tanker, a unit of Russian conglomerate Sovcomflot, asked a Caribbean court to seize the oil in hopes of collecting partial payment. Five months after crossing the Caribbean, the NS Columbus discharged the crude at the Statia terminal in St. Eustatius, owned by U.S. NuStar Energy, where PDVSA rents storage tanks, under a temporary decision by the St. Maarten court.

Fidelity has stepped up disclosure of how pre-IPO companies affect mutual fund performance. This week, for example, Boston-based Fidelity Investments showed how content-sharing company Pinterest Inc had an outsize impact on the portfolio performance of its most popular stock fund. Pre-IPO investments can amplify a fund's relative performance because they are not included in a comparison benchmark index. And the valuations attached to them by Fidelity and other mutual fund companies have far outpaced the stock market. Fidelity's $114 billion Contrafund disclosed that its small stake in Pinterest shaved 9 basis points off the fund's relative return versus the S&P; 500 Index. Contrafund's Series E stake in Pinterest was valued at $473.3 million in the first quarter. But at the end of May, that value was marked down by 17 percent, Fidelity disclosures showed.

But Pinterest was tied with TJX Companies Inc as Contrafund's largest detractor in the second quarter, even though the pre-IPO company accounted for only 0.34 percent of the fund's net assets. Contrafund, which is run by star Fidelity portfolio manager Will Danoff, posted a total second-quarter return of 6.09 percent in the second quarter, easily beating the 3.09 percent total return on the S&P; 500 Index. The fund's year-to-date return of 19.84 percent is better than 75 percent of U.S. large-cap growth mutual funds, according to Morningstar Inc data. Fidelity's valuation of Contrafund’s Series E stake in Pinterest has more than doubled since an initial investment of $159.4 million in October 2013, compared to Nasdaq's 62 percent rise. While Pinterest is a relative pipsqueak in the massive Contrafund portfolio, other Fidelity managers have made tech unicorns some of their largest holdings. At the end of May, ride-hailing company Uber was a top 20 stock in Fidelity's $22 billion Blue Chip Growth Fund. The fund's Series D stake in Uber was valued at $251.5 million, or 1.14 percent of net assets. Portfolio manager Sonu Kalra's Uber stake is bigger than his bet on Starbucks Corp ($202 million) and Bank of America Corp ($157 million). In the first quarter, Uber was among the fund's largest detractors, shaving 12 basis points off the fund's relative return. Only Qualcomm Inc and Lululemon Athletica Inc detracted more.

Paris is in competition with Los Angeles to host the 2024 games. Hildalgo has repeatedly said she intends to see Olympic swimmers use the river that snakes around Notre Dame Cathedral and past the Eiffel Tower should Paris be victorious.  This opens that door to open water swimming in Paris,  Hidalgo said at the opening of the canal water pools, sectioned off and filtered in the Bassin de la Villette, a wide section of canal in the north of the city.  Thanks to the Olympic Games we'll be able to see to it that the water in the Seine is clean water.  A Triathlon open water swim was held in the Seine in 2011, but a competition scheduled for 2012 was abandoned partly because of health worries. Casual bathing in the Paris section of the Seine was outlawed in 1923 and swimmers are a rare sight, even on the hottest days of the year. When he was mayor of Paris in 1990, former French president Jacques Chirac pledged to make the Seine clean again and said he would swim in the river himself in three years time. There is no record that he kept that promise, but progress has been made. Some species of fish absent for decades are now back, and Celia Blauel, a Paris city environment official, told Les Echos newspaper last week that the river was already clean enough to swim in on some days in the year.

In March, the same court ordered the roughly $20 million in Venezuelan oil to be held until state-run Sovcomflot's claim for $30 million in unpaid shipping fees is decided in a pending action by a British admiralty court. PDVSA rejects the claim.  Proceeds from the oil sale must be deposited into an escrow account at a Dutch or Antillian bank until the two sides reach a final agreement, the court said.  The crude has been stored at a rented facility on the neighboring island of St. Eustatius, but Sovcomflot requested the oil be sold to a third party, arguing there was no guarantee that the crude would be insured while at the terminal.  The Court of First Instance condemns PDVSA to cooperate on sale by ship owners of the cargo oil... to the best possible terms, including as high a price as possible,  said the order dated July 7 and seen this week. PDVSA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  The court action suggests even political allies of Venezuela such as Russia are losing patience with PDVSA's payment delays. The Venezuelan company's obsolete tankers are struggling to export oil and supply fuel to its domestic market. The court absolved PDVSA of trial costs but said it must pay a penalty of $500,000 per day up to a maximum of $5 million if it fails to comply with the ruling.  It was unclear when the penalty would begin. A PDVSA source said the company would auction the oil as soon as possible.  PDVSA in October sent the cargo on tanker NS Columbus to St. Eustatius, planning to sell the crude from there. But the owner of the tanker, a unit of Russian conglomerate Sovcomflot, asked a Caribbean court to seize the oil in hopes of collecting partial payment. Five months after crossing the Caribbean, the NS Columbus discharged the crude at the Statia terminal in St. Eustatius, owned by U.S. NuStar Energy, where PDVSA rents storage tanks, under a temporary decision by the St. Maarten court.

One of those remanded in custody on suspicion of belonging to a terrorist organization was Amnesty International's Turkey director, Idil Eser. Amnesty said truth and justice had become  total strangers . Eser, the German Peter Steudtner and eight other activists were detained this month while attending a workshop on digital security near Istanbul. A Turkish prosecutor asked a court on Monday to extend their detention pending trial on suspicion of links to the network of Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom Ankara blames for last year's attempted coup. The court ordered four of the 10 released, the newspaper Hurriyet said. In unscheduled remarks at a ceremony for athletes, Merkel said the case was another example of innocent people being  caught up in the wheels of the justice system . She said Steudtner's arrest was absolutely unjustified.  We declare our solidarity with him and all the others arrested ... the German government will do all it can, on all levels, to secure his release.  The comments were likely to further strain ties between Berlin and Ankara. These are already beset by a host of issues including Ankara's arrest of Deniz Yucel, a Turkish-German dual national who is a correspondent for the German newspaper Die Welt, on charges of spreading propaganda in support of a terrorist organization and inciting violence..  Political Witch-Hunt  Amnesty International's secretary general, Salil Shetty, said the decision to keep six of the activists in detention  shows that truth and justice have become total strangers in Turkey .  This is not a legitimate investigation,  he said,  this is a politically motivated witch-hunt that charts a frightening future for rights in Turkey.  In June, authorities detained Amnesty's local board chairman, Taner Kilic, along with 22 other lawyers, also for suspected links to Gulen, who has condemned the coup attempt and denied any involvement.  Some 150,000 people have been sacked or suspended from jobs in the civil service, military and private sector and roughly 50,000 people have been detained since the coup. Rights groups and some Western allies say Turkey is using the crackdown to quash all dissent. Opposition media outlets have been closed and around 160 journalists detained. Turkey is now the world's biggest jailer of journalists, according to the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists. The government - which on Monday extended the state of emergency brought in after the failed putsch for another three months - says such measures are necessary because of the gravity of the security threat. Steudtner's friends, family members and colleagues urged Turkey to release him immediately, saying in a statement that he and his Swedish colleague, Ali Gharavi, had been on an assignment for a development organization.

In a filing responding to a request made by the Trump administration on Friday, the state also asked the court not to further limit the number of refugees eligible to enter the United States under a separate part of U.S. President Donald Trump's March 6 executive order. A Supreme Court decision last month revived parts of Trump's executive order banning travelers from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for 90 days, as well as refugees for 120 days. Both had been blocked by lower courts. The Trump administration has asked the nine justices to overturn a ruling issued last week by a U.S. district judge in Hawaii in favor of the state. The government has a similar request pending in the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Judge Derrick Watson last Thursday rejected the administration's narrow interpretation of the Supreme Court's June decision, which said the bans could take effect but that people with a  bona fide relationship  to a U.S. person or entity could not be barred. Watson ruled that grandparents and various other relatives should be exempted from the ban. He also said that the assurance by a resettlement agency to provide basic services to a newly arrived refugee constitutes an adequate connection to the United States. In Tuesday's court filing, Hawaii's lawyers described the U.S. government's arguments against Watson's decision as  nonsense,  saying it was reasonable for the lower court to conclude that grandparents are close relatives.  The government's complaint boils down to the belief that any interpretation that meaningfully diminishes the practical consequence of its bans must be wrong,  the state said. The Hawaii court filing included a copy of a State Department email sent on Friday implementing Watson's ruling. It orders officials to  proceed to book travel for all refugees who already have an assurance and are otherwise cleared for travel.  Melanie Nezer, the vice president of the refugee agency HIAS, said some 3,500 refugees are ready to travel but she was not sure what the pace of resettlement would be this week. The court could act on the Trump administration's request at any time.

The Wall Street bank on Tuesday reported a 40 percent slump in second-quarter bond trading revenue, worse than many analysts had expected, and posted the weakest commodities results in its history as a public company. Seven analysts grilled Chief Financial Officer Marty Chavez on a conference call about whether Goldman is doing enough to turn the business around.  Everyone in our FICC business is intently focused on this topic, and at a granular, molecular level, working on it – as are all of us in the leadership team,  he said, using an acronym for fixed income, currency and commodities trading. The business delivered $1.2 billion in revenue, the weakest figure since the fourth quarter of 2015. Goldman's trading rout was deeper than the broad weakness that has plagued Wall Street due to historically low volatility. Citigroup Inc, Bank of America Corp and JPMorgan Chase & Co detailed bond trading declines of 6 percent to 19 percent. Morgan Stanley will report results on Wednesday. Goldman's shares fell 2.5 percent even though it managed to beat analysts' overall profit forecasts.  The stock has been the worst performing among shares of big U.S. banks, losing 4.3 percent this year through Monday's close, compared with a 6.7 percent rise in the S&P; 500 Financial Index. Goldman had declines in most areas of bond trading, including interest rate and currencies, but commodities trading was the worst, Chavez said. The bank does not break out numbers for each product, but Chavez said commodities had its worst performance out of the 73 quarters in which Goldman has publicly reported earnings. Many of Goldman's clients are active asset managers, like hedge funds, that have broadly been struggling to post attractive returns and keep investors from moving to passive vehicles like index funds and exchange-traded funds. Those clients been trading less, and therefore delivering less revenue to Goldman Sachs. A Goldman Sachs sign is displayed inside the company's post on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., April 18, 2017.Brendan McDermidThe bank does not have as many corporate clients in trading as bigger rivals that lend to big business and handle their hedges. Goldman has also historically been weighted more toward derivatives and commodities than other banks, and both areas were weak during the second quarter, Chavez said. Oil prices traded in a narrow range of $44 to $58 per barrel in the first half of 2017, in steep contrast with the first half of 2016 when they fluctuated between $27 and $50 per barrel. Volatility indices have also hit multi-year lows in the first half of 2017, meaning traders have fewer options to take directional bets. A view of the Goldman Sachs stall on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange July 16, 2013.Brendan McDermid/File PhotoTo improve bond trading broadly, Goldman is looking for ways to do more business with existing clients, Chavez said.  This is something all of us are evaluating and making changes and working on, and we're committed to it,  he said.  We know we need to do better.   Goldman has remained committed to its J. Aron & Company commodities unit even as peers like Morgan Stanley and Barclays PLC have scaled back over the last several years. Several Goldman executives including Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein, Co-President Harvey Schwartz and CFO Chavez are J. Aron alumni. Overall, Goldman's net income was nearly flat at $1.6 billion, or $3.95 per share, but beat analysts' average estimate of $3.39 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue fell 0.6 percent to $7.9 billion, as gains in equities trading, investing and lending and asset management helped offset the bond trading slump. Operating expenses fell about 2 percent to $5.4 billion. The lender's return on equity, a key measure of how profitably a bank uses shareholder money, was 8.7 percent. Analysts typically like to see a bank produce returns of at least 10 percent. Goldman, the fifth-largest U.S. bank by assets, has been shifting some focus to more stable businesses like investment management and consumer lending, but those businesses remain small relative to its trading operation.

The Horn of Africa country has over 113,000 kilometres (68,0000 miles) of paved roads and plans to increase that to 220,000 kilometres by 2019/20, official data showed.  We do not have private-run roads. Through public-private partnerships, the private sector is interested to develop roads,  Minister of Finance and Economic Development Abraham Tekeste told Reuters in an interview.  Through this arrangement, we could work to share the risks and create an environment whereby the private sector can recoup returns on its investment.  The move to partly liberalise the sector follows Ethiopa's decision to offer foreign companies stakes in the government-operated Ethiopian Shipping and Logistics Services Enterprise early this year and its energy sector in 2013. Ethiopia is one of the fastest-growing economies in Africa, but the expansion has mainly been fuelled by huge public investment. The spending has gone into roads, schools, new highways and dams for hydroelectric power. It opened an electrified railway linking the landlocked nation to a port in neighbouring Djibouti this year. Abraham said the government expected gross domestic product to grow 11 percent in the 2016/17 fiscal year, up from 8 percent the previous period. Earlier this month, Ethiopia's parliament passed a 320.8 billion-birr ($13.9 billion) budget for the 2017/18 financial year (July 8-July 7), an increase of nearly 17 percent on the previous year. About a quarter of that amount is set to be spent on roads. The International Monetary Fund has said Ethiopia needs to attract more private investment to maintain growth. But the government has in the past tended to brush off such advice and said it would keep charge of key sectors.  Why do we continue to invest in infrastructure? To make private investment feasible. With no roads, private investment will not be worthwhile,  Abraham said. Though starting from a low base, foreign investment has also been rising the last five years, including for farms producing flowers and other horticultural products for export and in textiles. Abraham said Ethiopia took in over $3 billion in foreign direct investment last year and expected that number to rise by the end of this year.

On Friday, Reuters cited two sources saying that Britain had helped to secure an investment in the firm's Burnaston car plant with a letter reassuring the Japanese automaker over future trading arrangements. The business ministry has confirmed the existence of a letter but has refused to release it. One of the sources said the letter to Toyota was similar to one sent to Japanese carmaker Nissan (7201.T) last year when it decided to build two new models at its plant in northern England. The previous chairman of parliament's Treasury Select Committee raised questions about the Nissan deal last year. Reuters contacted the new committee chairwoman on Monday for comment on the reported reassurances to Toyota.  To provide clarity to the public, as the assurances may cost the taxpayer money, and to other businesses, who are craving certainty to plan for Brexit, the letters should be published immediately,  Nicky Morgan said in an emailed statement.  It remains to be seen what these assurances could have been that were robust enough for them to invest in the UK, but avoided any obligation to report to parliament,  she said. A Toyota spokesman referred to the company's statement from the day of the March 16 investment announcement which said the British government was providing up to 21.3 million pounds in funding for training and research and development. FILE PHOTO - Toyota flags wave at Motorcity Toyota dealership in Rome, Italy  October 10, 2012.Max Rossi/File PhotoThe chairwoman of parliament's business committee, opposition Labour lawmaker Rachel Reeves, said it was unacceptable that the government had refused to disclose its private reassurances to Toyota.   It is vital that the government is not seen to be cutting sweetheart deals or granting special favors that could undermine our negotiating position,  she said in a statement.  New Toyota cars are transported from their manufacturing facility in Burnaston, Britain March 16, 2017.Darren Staples The government needs to swiftly develop an open and inclusive strategy when it comes to its Brexit negotiations that offer all sectors the best chance of success when it comes to creating jobs and securing investment.    A business ministry spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Business minister Greg Clark suggested last year that assurances offered to Nissan were available to other firms. The opposition Labour Party said  secretive, one-off deals were unfair and showed a lack of coherent strategy.  The government can't go round making individual deals with some companies whilst leaving others out in the cold,  said the party's business spokeswoman Rebecca Long-Bailey.  A first full round of Brexit negotiations kicked off on Monday in Brussels amid divisions among British Prime Minister Theresa May's ministers over what form Britain's exit from the European Union should take.  Major car firms are worried about the long-term viability of their British plants and are using their upcoming investment decisions to push for promises to maintain free trade after Britain's exit from the EU, which is due to take place in March 2019.

In a report to a closed door session of the National Assembly on Friday, which was broadcast by state-run television on Monday evening, Cabrisas said export revenues through June were short of expectations by $400 million. Cabrisas said imports in 2017 would decline again and be $1.5 billion less than planned “due to difficulties in using credits, limits assigning liquidity and debts on expired letters of credit that have not been paid.” A cash crunch and lower oil supplies from political ally Venezuela forced the Caribbean island to slash imports and reduce the use of fuel and electricity last year, helping tip its centrally planned economy into recession for the first time in nearly a quarter century. The economy expanded 1.1 percent through June this year, Cabrisas said, thanks to a tourism boom and growth in agriculture, construction and a few other sectors. However, Cabrisas said if last year 85 percent of imports were financed through commercial credits, through May the country had managed to obtain similar financing for just 40.8 percent as suppliers balked at piling up more debt.  That means the cash-short and import-dependent country must seek more government debt for supplies. Since oil prices slumped in 2014, Venezuela has reduced shipments of subsidized fuel to communist-run Cuba, as well as payments for Cuban professional services. Venezuela's oil and fuel deliveries to Cuba slid almost 13 percent in the first half, according to documents from state-run oil company PDVSA viewed by Reuters, and were down 40 percent from the same period in 2015, forcing Cuba to purchase some fuel from former benefactor Russia. Cabrisas said Cuba was forced to seek fuel on the open market and had spent $99.6 million in addition to what had been planned. Other oil-producing allies, such as Angola and Algeria, also find themselves short of cash to pay for Cuban services. A boom in tourism has not been enough to stem the hemorrhaging of hard currency as production and prices of key export earners refined oil products and nickel have also fallen in a country embargoed by the United States. Cuba does not publish up-to-date information on its debt, balance of payments and current account.

Rover, the biggest gas pipeline under construction in the United States, originally was expected to start in late July but the first phase was pushed back after regulators said Energy Transfer Partners (ETP) first needed to meet certain requirements.  As a result of our continued efforts to work with FERC and the Ohio EPA, we are anticipating that part or all of Phase 1 has the potential for an in service date of late summer of 2017,  Alexis Daniel, a spokeswoman at Energy Transfer Partners (ETP) said in an email.   She was referring to delays caused by requirements set by the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) after drilling fluids spilled into an Ohio wetland during construction in April. The company, however, said it still expects the second and final phase of the $4.2 billion project to enter service in November.     On May 10, FERC banned ETP from starting new horizontal directional drilling under waterways and roads following the release of about two million gallons of drilling fluid, a clay and water mix, into Tuscarawas River wetland in Ohio.  FERC said it would continue to ban ETP from new horizontal drilling until the company explains how non-approved hydrocarbons got into the fluid that spilled into the Tuscarawas wetlands. The company must also develop a plan to remove and dispose of drilling fluids to an Ohio EPA-approved site, among other things. Separately, the Ohio EPA last week asked the state's attorney general to pursue civil penalties against ETP for a series of environmental violations during the Rover construction, including the Tuscarawas wetlands spill.     Once it enters service, the pipeline will move up to 3.25 billion cubic feet (bcf) per day of gas from the Marcellus and Utica shale fields in Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia to customers in Ohio, Michigan, Ontario and elsewhere.     One bcf of gas is enough to power about 5 million U.S. homes. Analysts expect several energy companies to increase gas production once Rover enters service to fill the pipe, including Antero Resources Corp (AR.N), Eclipse Resources Corp (ECR.N),EQT Corp (EQT.N), Gulfport Energy Corp (GPOR.O), Rice Energy Inc(RICE.N), Range Resources Corp (RRC.N) and Southwestern EnergyCo (SWN.N).

The United States on Monday released its goals for the talks, which aim to update an agreement that came into force in 1994. These include a desire to ditch the Chapter 19 dispute settlement mechanism that has hindered the United States from pursuing anti-dumping and anti-subsidy cases against Mexican and Canadian firms.  There are may things they raised where we take quite a different position. We think it's critical to have some kind of a dispute resolution mechanism incorporated - it was in 1994 and it continues to be,  said David MacNaughton, Canada's ambassador to Washington.  Whether or not ... (it) can be improved or modernized, I think we're up for discussion on that,  he said in televised remarks to reporters in Edmonton, Alberta. Under Chapter 19, which Canada insisted be in NAFTA, binational panels hear complaints about illegal subsidies and dumping and then issue binding decisions. The United States has frequently lost such cases. MacNaughton said he was not particularly surprised by the list of U.S. demands, many of which had been flagged ahead of time by the administration of President Donald Trump. Both Mexico and the United States face important elections in 2018 which could complicate the negotiations. Mexico says it would make sense to wrap up the talks by the end of this year, a goal Canadian officials say privately is impossible if the agreement is to be properly updated.  Obviously if we could get a clarification of the trading relationship sooner rather than later it would be better, but having said that, we're not going to rush into a bad deal,  said MacNaughton. The envoy also said Canada would continue to defend its system of tariffs and quotas that keep domestic dairy prices high and imports low. The U.S. dairy lobby is ratcheting up the pressure on Canada as the NAFTA talks draw closer, demanding concessions the Canadian government looks unwilling to grant.

In a filing responding to a request made by the Trump administration on Friday, the state also asked the court not to further limit the number of refugees eligible to enter the United States under a separate part of U.S. President Donald Trump's March 6 executive order. A Supreme Court decision last month revived parts of Trump's executive order banning travelers from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for 90 days, as well as refugees for 120 days. Both had been blocked by lower courts. The Trump administration has asked the nine justices to overturn a ruling issued last week by a U.S. district judge in Hawaii in favor of the state. The government has a similar request pending in the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Judge Derrick Watson last Thursday rejected the  administration's narrow interpretation of the Supreme Court's June decision, which said the bans could take effect but that people with a  bona fide relationship  to a U.S. person or entity could not be barred. Watson ruled that grandparents and various other relatives should be exempted from the ban. He also said that the assurance by a resettlement agency to provide basic services to a newly arrived refugee constitutes an adequate connection to the United States. In Tuesday's court filing, Hawaii's lawyers described the U.S. government's arguments against Watson's decision as  nonsense,  saying it was reasonable for the lower court to conclude that grandparents are close relatives.  The government's complaint boils down to the belief that any interpretation that meaningfully diminishes the practical consequence of its bans must be wrong,  the state said. The Hawaii court filing included a copy of a State Department email sent on Friday implementing Watson's ruling. It orders officials to  proceed to book travel for all refugees who already have an assurance and are otherwise cleared for travel.  Melanie Nezer, the vice president of the refugee agency HIAS, said some 3,500 refugees are ready to travel but she was not sure what the pace of resettlement would be this week. The court could act on the Trump administration's request at any time.

The Canadian government late last year introduced tighter mortgage lending rules to discourage consumers from taking on too much debt. The Ontario provincial government in April imposed a number of measures intended to rein in the hot Toronto market, including a tax on foreign buyers that has caused sales and prices in Canada's largest city to decline. Ontario's moves, which were similar to a foreign buyers' tax implemented in Vancouver last summer, came amid worries Toronto's housing market was overheating. Morneau said the changes by both levels of government were intended to make sure home prices do not rise unsustainably and that the response in the market was playing out largely as had been expected.  We believe the measures we put in place are having the desired impact and that is that they are slowing down those markets that were rising at an unsustainable pace,  Morneau told reporters. But Morneau also said it was too early to draw conclusions on the ultimate effect on the market. Economists are watching the depth of the cool down in Toronto closely and expect a recent interest rate hike from the Bank of Canada could prolong the slowdown compared to Vancouver, where prices have rebounded. Improving economic growth means households are more resilient to higher interest rates than they were a year ago, though the increase in rates will likely  change people's behavior in some way,  Morneau said. The Bank of Canada last week raised interest rates for the first time in seven years, prompting concerns overly indebted Canadians will find it harder to keep up with borrowing costs.

The resignations provide some temporary relief to Turnbull, who could now seek to push key legislation, on health and media laws, through the Senate before replacements are appointed. Australian politicians are not eligible to be elected to parliament if they are hold dual or plural citizenship.

Droughts are shriveling high-quality wheat crops in key breadbaskets, sending prices to multi-year highs as bread makers scramble for supplies.  Low prices against a backdrop of plentiful supply had discouraged U.S. farmers from planting wheat, and dry weather is now exacerbating the shortage from North America to Australia. Canada's Alberta province, another top wheat producer, is also suffering from unusually dry weather.       The million-dollar question that the trade is still trying to figure out is, of all the global supplies out there, how much is going to be high-protein wheat?  said Terry Reilly, senior commodity analyst with Futures International in Chicago. Wanted: High-Protein Wheat The world is awash with lower grades, with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) projecting world wheat stocks at the end of the 2017/18 marketing year at a record high of 260.6 million tonnes.  But flour millers and bakers need milling wheat, often with a protein level of 12 percent or higher, to make consistent bread. U.S. spring wheat, typically with a protein content of 14 percent or higher, is also used for blending with lower grades of wheat. Spring wheat usually commands a premium over the lower-quality grades. The United States is one of the world's biggest wheat exporters. Latest estimates from the USDA put U.S. production of spring wheat other than durum, which is used for pasta, at 423 million bushels, the smallest since 2002. Wheat futures on the Chicago Board of Trade hit two-year highs this month above $5.50 a bushel, while values on the Minneapolis Grain Exchange - a niche market for high-protein spring wheat - spiked above $8 a bushel for the first time in four years. Market direction will depend now in part on how spring wheat crops in the United States and Canada, which typically have high protein levels, finish the growing season, and whether Australia's drought persists. Next week, the market will find out how bad the damage is to wheat fields in North Dakota, by far the biggest U.S. spring wheat producer, when industry experts and farmers conduct an annual crop tour. Drought and searing heat have scorched crops in the western portion of the state, but crops along the eastern border and in neighboring Minnesota so far have escaped major damage. The impact of weather problems is magnified because wheat plantings in the United States for 2017 were the smallest in records dating to 1919, reflecting low prices that prompted farmers to plant other crops including soybeans and corn. European Option?  The European Union and Russia, which vie with the United States to be the world's top exporter, have the potential to supply some customers that normally rely on North American high-protein grain. European traders are hopeful German high-protein wheat will take over export sales to traditional customers of U.S. spring wheat, especially Nigeria and other African countries. There are some concerns, however, that late-season rains in Germany may reduce protein levels.  The late rain could cause higher yields in tonnage terms but these larger-yield crops often have lower protein,” one trader said.  It is too early to say if the rain will reduce protein or if Germany’s harvest will contain sufficient volumes of high-protein wheat.  Russia's wheat crop has been delayed this year by rainy and cold weather but the country's harvest is still expected to be large, only slightly lower than a record crop a year ago.  The quality in general will be higher than a year ago,  Arkady Zlochevsky, the head of Russia's Grain Union, a non-government farmers' lobby, told reporters in Moscow on Tuesday. Traders and analysts are, however, cutting expectations for Australia's wheat production due to a lack of soil moisture.   Some areas in Western Australia (one of the larger wheat and rapeseed producing states) are experiencing all-time record low record soil moisture levels. With conditions as they are ... drought stress will almost certainly be an issue for crops moving forward,  said Thomson Reuters weather analyst Ed Whalen.  The market is beginning to factor in a crop of between 19 million to 21 million tonnes,  said Matthew Pattison, trading manager at Nidera, the grains trader acquired this year by China's COFCO Group.  Australia's chief commodity forecaster in June pegged wheat output at 24.1 million tonnes.  Should Australian exporters have less wheat to ship, Indonesian and South Korean millers will be forced to turn to supplies from the Black Sea, where production has been aggressively expanded in the last decade. Australia has steadily lost market share in recent years, especially to Russia, and analysts believe there could be a permanent shift away from the world's No. 4 exporter. A shortfall in the U.S. spring wheat crop could bolster imports of Canadian spring wheat, said Jay O'Neil, an agricultural economist with Kansas State University.  Not everyone faces shortages of high-quality wheat, however. China has increased output of better-quality wheat significantly this year, and that could cut its demand for imports from major suppliers such as the United States and Australia.

Donofrio,BANK OF AMERICA,RESULTS/ (UPDATE 4),Americas,United States","sector":"Homepage","content":"(Reuters) - Bank of America Corp reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit on strength in its consumer bank and cost cuts that are beginning to bear fruit after years of branch closures, staff cuts and efforts to reduce technology and paper-related expenses. Chief Executive Officer Brian Moynihan spoke glowingly of a broad turnaround in the consumer business that began in 2009, calling its $2 billion in quarterly profit a  milestone  on a call with analysts on Tuesday. In the midst of the Great Recession, the unit had 6,000 financial centers, 100,000 employees, two-thirds the amount of deposits and little in the way of digital banking capabilities. Regulatory changes put into place following the 2008 financial crisis soon began to curtail revenue, as did strategic decisions like cutting back on business generated from third parties. The business recently has been benefiting from the cost cuts as well as improved technology, growth in deposits and a focus on higher-quality borrowers, Moynihan said. In the second quarter, the division managed to increase deposits at a lower cost and use those cheaper funds to fuel loan growth, helping it to record a higher profit than any other unit. Overall, Bank of America hit a target of spending 60 cents for every dollar of revenue it produces, down from 63 cents a year earlier. Investors have been watching that metric closely as a sign of how efficiently the bank is run. Bank of America, the second-largest U.S. lender by assets, is working to cut annual operating expenses to $53 billion next year. Consumer banking helped Bank of America deliver net income of $4.9 billion, or 46 cents per share, up 11 percent from the year-ago period. Analysts had been expecting 43 cents, on average, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The bank's total revenue of $23.07 billion also beat the average analyst estimate of $21.78 billion.  This was a good quarter all around for BofA,  said Evercore ISI analyst Glenn Schorr.  You really have to look hard to find a few issues to talk about.  Moynihan and Chief Financial Officer Paul Donofrio both characterized the second quarter as one of the best in the bank's history. But its stock was down 1.1 percent at $23.75 at midday, following a 8.4 percent year-to-date rise through Monday's close. Even as big banks have reported better results, investors have been disappointed that profits are not growing faster. Last week, shares of JPMorgan Chase & Co, Wells Fargo & Co and Citigroup Inc each fell after beating analysts' estimates, as did Goldman Sachs Group Inc on Tuesday. Bank of America's profit and revenue beats were overshadowed by net interest income falling short of expectations, analysts said. That metric, which rose 8.6 percent to $10.99 billion during the second quarter, helps gauge the difference between a bank's cost of funding and the income it generates from those funds. Bank of America is considered the most interest-rate sensitive among big U.S. banks because of the way its balance sheet is constructed in terms of loan maturities, types of funding and hedges. Apart from its global markets unit, which suffered a downturn in trading like other Wall Street banks, Bank of America's other business lines also produced higher profits. Wealth and investment management reported record net income of $804 million, and a record pretax profit margin of 28 percent. Both the wealth business and retail brokerage, which sits inside the consumer business, attracted more assets. Global banking also earned more money, with growth in corporate and commercial loans, more revenue from transaction services and higher investment banking fees related to those customers. Non-interest expenses rose 1.7 percent, partly due to charges related to closing data centers. But the bank still managed to hit Moynihan's efficiency target and produced 5 percentage points of  operating leverage,  which measures how well a company can maintain revenue while cutting costs.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bank-of-america-results-idUSL1N1K919V"},

Essam al-Marzouq also told Reuters there was no need for the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to hold an extraordinary meeting before its scheduled gathering in November because OPEC-led supply cuts were  working well . OPEC and 11 non-OPEC states have cut output by 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) since January. The curbs, which were initially due to run for the first half of 2017, were extended to March 2018 in a bid to cut oversupply and lift prices.  We are in the first two weeks of the extension period. It is too early to say now what I will do in November,  Marzouq said in an interview in the Kuwaiti capital, saying there was no need to deepen the cuts for now. He said OPEC should  wait and see what happens, at least in the next couple of weeks until the end of July, to see the compliance data and the effect on the stocks.  OPEC wants to bring inventories in industrialized states down from above 3 billion barrels to the five-year average of 2.7 billion. The International Energy Agency said stockpiles fell in May but remained 266 million barrels above the average. Brent oil prices climbed above $58 a barrel in January from a 2016 low of about $27 a barrel, but persistent oversupply has driven it back below $50. The minister said a big drawdown in global inventories had not been expected in the first half of 2017.  We have always been looking at the second half of the year,  he said, citing stronger demand in the U.S. summer driving season. U.S. government data showed U.S. inventories in the week to July 7 fell by 7.6 million barrels, the biggest drop in 10 months and more than expected. [EIA/S] The minister said this showed the agreement to cut output had  started to have an impact.  Adding to OPEC's challenge, U.S. shale production has been rising and output from Nigeria and Libya, two OPEC states exempted from the agreement, has also climbed. Even with higher Nigerian and Libyan production, Marzouq said OPEC output was still within the 32.5 million bpd target set under the global pact.  We are still within that range,  he said, putting average production for June for the 13 OPEC states that originally agreed on the deal at 32.4 million bpd.  A joint ministerial committee, known as the JMMC and headed by Kuwait, monitors compliance with the supply pact and meets in St Petersburg on July 24. At that gathering, Marzouq will meet counterparts from Saudi Arabia, Russia, Algeria, Venezuela and Oman. The JMMC can make recommendations to OPEC and other oil producers to adjust the agreement, if necessary Marzouq said it was too early to talk about recommendations to adjust the deal, or to cap production from Nigeria or Libya.  It is too early for that,  he said. The Kuwaiti minister said oil prices had started to stabilise between $45 and $50 and said this was  what markets see now as a fair price . But he said prices would get a boost in coming months as inventories fell.

The collapse of his fellow Republicans' push to repeal and replace Obamacare with their own healthcare bill in the U.S. Senate again raised doubts in financial markets about Trump's ability to enact tax cuts and infrastructure spending. The dollar fell 0.51 percent against a basket of key currencies, setting a 10-month low and extending its 2017 decline to more than 7 percent.  It pushes out the rest of the agenda. It’s hard to do a tax reform in the style that it was campaigned on,  said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities in New York.  The healthcare hurdle pushes everything in Trump’s agenda to 2018.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 85.09 points, or 0.39 percent, to 21,544.63, the S&P; 500 lost 2.32 points, or 0.09 percent, to 2,456.82. The Nasdaq Composite added 11.05 points, or 0.18 percent, to 6,325.48. Netflix shares soared after the streaming television company's strong customer growth, boosting the Nasdaq. Shares of Goldman Sachs and Bank of America fell after those banks' respective quarterly reports, and weighed on bank indexes in the United States and Europe . Harley-Davidson shares tumbled after the motorcycle maker's weak forecast. In Europe, the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index lost 1.11 percent. Sweden's Ericsson and fashion retailer Zalando plummeted after their respective reports. MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.08 percent after touching an all-time high on Monday. In currencies, the euro was up 0.71 percent to $1.1559 against the dollar, and hit its strongest level against the U.S. currency since May 2016.  The setback for Trump is a setback for the U.S. dollar,  said Kathy Lien, managing director at BK Asset Management in New York.  I think that really casts doubt on the Trump administration's broader strategies.  Aside from the Trump agenda setback, there are increasing doubts about further near-term rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. Expectations for the Fed hiking interest rates this year have been pushed back to the fourth quarter, the latest Reuters poll of economists showed. A poll conducted last month predicted the Fed would raise rates by September. Sterling fell against the dollar and euro on Tuesday, after data showed British inflation unexpectedly slowing for the first time since October last year, lowering expectations of an interest rate increase this year. U.S. Treasury yields fell after the latest political drama in Washington, while more data pointed to benign inflation with a drop in import prices for a second straight month. Benchmark 10-year notes last rose 12/32 in price to yield 2.2678 percent, from 2.309 percent late on Monday. Yields across the globe rose sharply after Trump won the U.S. election in November on promises for tax reforms and infrastructure investment that were expected to boost growth and inflation in the world's largest economy. Oil prices rose slightly as solid demand soaked up some of what is seen as an oversupplied market, but Ecuador's decision to opt out of a supply reduction complicated the outlook for an OPEC-led cut agreement. U.S. crude rose 0.46 percent to $46.23 per barrel and Brent was last at $48.68, up 0.54 percent on the day. Copper rose 0.14 percent to $6,004.50 a tonne.

Pollution from cars, including those with diesel engines, has become a sensitive subject in Germany since Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) admitted to systematic cheating of emissions tests to mask levels of health threatening nitrogen oxides.  Cities such as Munich and Stuttgart are looking at banning older diesel cars, whose emissions they blame for causing an increase in respiratory diseases. The Ifo study, published on Tuesday, said a switch to sales of zero-emission cars would threaten 426,000 car manufacturing jobs, with the rest coming from related industries, such as suppliers. Two months before Germany's national elections, the government faces growing pressure to reduce emissions or face complete bans on diesel cars in some cities. Representatives of federal and regional governments will meet with carmakers on Aug. 2 to find ways to curb diesel-related pollution. The VDA, representing carmakers such as Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE), Daimler (DAIGn.DE) and BMW (BMWG.DE), has already been talking to the government on steps to curb pollution from diesel cars that the industry hopes will avert driving bans which have already hit sales of diesel models.  Industry groups are deliberately pushing the worst-case scenario to safeguard their vested interests,  NordLB analyst Frank Schwope said. For every 2-3 jobs that will be lost from phasing out combustion engines, one new position will be created in R&D;, IT and other sectors related to zero-emission technology, Schwope said, dismissing Ifo's findings as incomprehensible. Environment Minister Barbara Hendricks told Tuesday's edition of German business daily Handelsblatt:  The auto industry has the responsibility that it will not come to this (driving bans).  She said the industry had to retrofit the affected cars as quickly as possible and must do so at its own cost. Ifo president Clemens Fuest dismissed criticism that Germany's car industry has been slow to embrace new technologies as it has focused on defending the combustion engine that has driven its prosperity.  That thesis doesn't stand up given efforts on innovation,  Fuest said, noting German carmakers own 40 percent of international patents on combustion engine cars and a quarter of patents on fuel cell cars. But Ferdinand Dudenhoeffer, head of the Center of Automotive Research at the University of Duisburg-Essen, said high spending on R&D; has mainly benefited combustion technology and carmakers had some catching up to do on battery research.  The VDA is getting its defences in position,  he said.  They're still keeping to combustion engines because it's hard to predict how electric car demand will pan out.

Netflix rose 14.3 percent to hit a record high, following the video streaming company's robust subscriber growth. However, Goldman Sachs reported a 40 percent drop in bond trading revenue, driving its shares lower by 2.3 percent and weighing on the Dow. Bank of America fell 1.3 percent and dragged the S&P.; Last week, shares of JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Citigroup had taken a beating after their quarterly results and forecasts failed to excite investors. The S&P; healthcare sector also came under scrutiny, after the healthcare bill to replace Obamacare sank in the Senate, as Republicans remained divided on how to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. The failure of the bill spelled uncertainty for President Donald Trump's agenda of tax reform and an infrastructure overhaul, leaving the president without any major legislative accomplishments six months into his tenure.  The healthcare bill not coming through raises some continued concerns about the ability of Washington to push through favorable fiscal policies,  said Lisa Kopp, head of traditional investments at U.S. Bank Wealth Management. News about the bill's collapse sent the U.S. dollar to a 10-month low against a basket of major currencies. At 12:44 p.m. ET (1644 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 83.9 points, or 0.39 percent, at 21,545.82, the S&P; 500 was down 2.3 points, or 0.09 percent, at 2,456.84.

With valuation where they are, it is really important for earnings to come through for the market to retain their momentum and push upwards,  said Kopp. Analysts are estimating an 8.2 percent rise in second-quarter earnings for the S&P; 500 companies from a year earlier. This follows a robust first quarter when U.S. companies posted their best earnings since 2011, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

The Wall Street bank on Tuesday reported a 40 percent slump in second-quarter bond trading revenue, worse than many analysts had expected, and posted the weakest commodities results in its history as a public company. Seven analysts grilled Chief Financial Officer Marty Chavez on a conference call about whether Goldman is doing enough to turn the business around.  Everyone in our FICC business is intently focused on this topic, and at a granular, molecular level, working on it – as are all of us in the leadership team,  he said, using an acronym for fixed income, currency and commodities trading. The business delivered $1.2 billion in revenue, the weakest figure since the fourth quarter of 2015. Goldman's trading rout was deeper than the broad weakness that has plagued Wall Street due to historically low volatility. Citigroup Inc, Bank of America Corp and JPMorgan Chase & Co detailed bond trading declines of 6 percent to 19 percent. Morgan Stanley will report results on Wednesday. Goldman's shares fell 2.5 percent even though it managed to beat analysts' overall profit forecasts.  The stock has been the worst performing among shares of big U.S. banks, losing 4.3 percent this year through Monday's close, compared with a 6.7 percent rise in the S&P; 500 Financial Index. Goldman had declines in most areas of bond trading, including interest rate and currencies, but commodities trading was the worst, Chavez said. The bank does not break out numbers for each product, but Chavez said commodities had its worst performance out of the 73 quarters in which Goldman has publicly reported earnings. Many of Goldman's clients are active asset managers, like hedge funds, that have broadly been struggling to post attractive returns and keep investors from moving to passive vehicles like index funds and exchange-traded funds.

Goldman has also historically been weighted more toward derivatives and commodities than other banks, and both areas were weak during the second quarter, Chavez said. Oil prices traded in a narrow range of $44 to $58 per barrel in the first half of 2017, in steep contrast with the first half of 2016 when they fluctuated between $27 and $50 per barrel. Volatility indices have also hit multi-year lows in the first half of 2017, meaning traders have fewer options to take directional bets.

This is something all of us are evaluating and making changes and working on, and we're committed to it,  he said.  We know we need to do better.   Goldman has remained committed to its J. Aron & Company commodities unit even as peers like Morgan Stanley and Barclays PLC have scaled back over the last several years. Several Goldman executives including Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein, Co-President Harvey Schwartz and CFO Chavez are J. Aron alumni. Overall, Goldman's net income was nearly flat at $1.6 billion, or $3.95 per share, but beat analysts' average estimate of $3.39 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue fell 0.6 percent to $7.9 billion, as gains in equities trading, investing and lending and asset management helped offset the bond trading slump. Operating expenses fell about 2 percent to $5.4 billion. The lender's return on equity, a key measure of how profitably a bank uses shareholder money, was 8.7 percent. Analysts typically like to see a bank produce returns of at least 10 percent. Goldman, the fifth-largest U.S. bank by assets, has been shifting some focus to more stable businesses like investment management and consumer lending, but those businesses remain small relative to its trading operation.

Trump's promises to cut taxes and boost spending has triggered expectations of faster inflation that could force the U.S. Federal Reserve to raise interest rates more than expected, potentially draining capital from emerging markets.     Trader skepticism over Trump's pledges grew after a second attempt by U.S. Senate Republicans to pass a healthcare reform bill failed, casting further doubt over the Fed's plan to hike rates once more this year.     Currencies from Brazil, Mexico, Chile  and Colombia strengthened between 0.5 percent and 0.7 percent, extending gains last week.     Wider emerging market stocks flirted with 27-month highs but Latin American bourses mostly fell as traders feared slower growth could translate into lower U.S. imports from key trading partners in the region.

Consumer prices rose by 2.6 percent compared with a year earlier, the Office for National Statistics said, down from a nearly four-year high of 2.9 percent in May. Economists had expected the rate to remain unchanged and some of them trimmed their forecasts for price growth to just below 3 percent in 2017 as a whole after Tuesday's figures. But BoE Governor Mark Carney said the  big picture  for inflation remained the same and the main driver was still the fall in sterling since last year's Brexit vote.  That's what's pushing inflation up, and inflation will be above target for a period of time and today's figures are consistent with that,  he told Sky News.     Sterling lost half a cent against the U.S. dollar and British government bond prices jumped as the figures suggested the BoE was under little pressure to raise rates when it next meets in early August, despite concerns among some of its policymakers about rising prices.    The fall in inflation was the sharpest between any two months since February 2015, reflecting a fall in global oil prices, and slowing price pressure in factories.  This is going to kill the chances of a rate rise in the short term. We will learn more about the Bank of England's thinking in a couple of weeks, but we can expect the calls for a rate rise to reduce to a whimper,  Lucy O'Carroll, chief economist at fund managers Aberdeen Asset Management, said.     However, many economists have said they expect inflation to pick up again soon, adding to the strain on households which are seeing salaries rise more slowly than prices.  There's lots of pressure still in the tank,  Alan Clarke, an economist at Scotiabank, said.  Britain's inflation rate has risen sharply since last year's referendum decision to leave the European Union which pushed down the value of the pound, making imports more expensive. A shopper checks her shopping list in a supermarket in London, Britain April 11, 2017.Neil HallBoe Likely to Remain Patient The BoE has been taken by surprise by the speed of the increase this year. Its most recent forecasts saw inflation peaking at 2.8 percent later in 2017 while most economists have said they expect inflation to reach at least 3 percent. The BoE did accurately predict that inflation in June would be 2.6 percent. The BoE has so far chosen not to respond by raising rates, saying the Brexit hit to the pound is likely to be temporary.  However, three of the eight BoE rate setters voted to raise rates in June. One of the dissenters has since left.  Carney has said a rate hike would probably be needed if the economy overcomes its slowdown of earlier this year and wages - which are lagging behind inflation - grow more strongly. The BoE announces its next decision on rates on Aug. 3. A Reuters poll of economists showed the BoE was expected to keep rates on hold throughout 2017 and 2018. The ONS said inflation was pushed down by fuel prices after a fall in global oil prices and a partial recovery in the value of the pound last month. A drop in the cost of computer games and equipment, which rose in May, was also a factor. Data on factory gate prices suggested that the most intense pressure on consumer prices is easing.  Output prices rose at their slowest rate since December of last year, up 3.3 percent. Prices paid by factories for materials and energy rose at their slowest rate since September, up 9.9 percent on the year.

We spent our whole lives looking for them, without stopping.

I can say that after 75 years of waiting this news gives me a deep sense of calm,  added the 79-year-old. In an overnight statement, Valais cantonal police said that two bodies bearing identity papers had been discovered last week by a worker on Tsanfleuron glacier near a ski lift above Les Diablerets resort at an altitude of 2,615 meters (8,600 feet). The remains were partly submerged in a hole in the ice. An autopsy and DNA testing would be carried out to confirm the identities of the couple.  The bodies were lying near each other. It was a man and a woman wearing clothing dating from the period of World War Two,  Bernhard Tschannen, director of Glacier 3000, told the paper.  They were perfectly preserved in the glacier and their belongings were intact.   We think they may have fallen into a crevasse where they stayed for decades. As the glacier receded, it gave up their bodies,  he told the daily Tribune de Geneve. The pair were among 280 people listed as missing in the Alps or rivers of the Valais since 1925, officials said. Bettina Schrag, cantonal head of forensic medicine, told Swiss public radio RTS:  Given the current shrinking of glaciers, we have to expect more and more such findings.  Marcelin Dumoulin, 40, was a shoemaker, while Francine, 37, was a teacher. They left five sons and two daughters.   It was the first time my mother went with him on such an excursion. She was always pregnant and couldn't climb in the difficult conditions of a glacier,  Udry-Dumoulin said.   After a while, we children were separated and placed in families. I was lucky to stay with my aunt,  she said.  We all lived in the region but became strangers.   For the funeral, I won't wear black. I think that white would be more appropriate.

The $4 trillion blueprint would allow an overhaul of the U.S. tax code to pass Congress without support from Democrats, along with a partial repeal of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law and $203 billion in savings from mandatory federal programs including food stamps over the next decade. Those changes and others would be combined in a single piece of legislation.  In past years the budget has only been a vision but now with a Republican Congress and a Republican White House this budget is a plan for action,  House Budget Committee Chair Diane Black said at a news conference. The prospect of reduced benefits for the poor and major tax cuts for businesses and individuals is already a source of infighting between House Republican conservatives who want larger spending reductions and moderates who oppose them. In the Senate, a similar Republican battle over the repeal of Obamacare taxes on the wealthy and reduced health insurance benefits for lower-income Americans has helped sink healthcare legislation. The spending plan, which covers the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, aims to move the government from a $472 billion deficit in 2018 to a $9 billion budget surplus in 2027. The change is based in part on a Budget Committee forecast of U.S. economic growth of 2.6 percent annually that assumes future changes in tax, healthcare and financial laws, as well as deregulation. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has forecast economic growth of 1.9 percent from 2017 to 2027. The House budget plan would include $621.5 billion in defense spending and $511 billion on nondefense discretionary spending in 2018. The Budget Committee is expected to approve the plan later this week and send it to the House floor for a full vote. Black said she believed it would have the support to pass. The plan is vital to Republican aims of overhauling the U.S. tax code while avoiding a Democratic filibuster in the Senate. The plan instructs 11 House committees to find savings from programs and policies they oversee, including taxes, financial regulation, food stamps and federal pensions. The instructions would allow final legislation to pass the Senate with a simple majority through a parliamentary process know as reconciliation. Republicans control the Senate by a 52-48 margin. Without reconciliation, tax reform would require 60 Senate votes. (Additional reporting by Amanda Becker)","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-congress-tax-idUSL1N1K917A"},

I just love the game, and playing baseball throughout my career, it was just kind of an honor to play, and even if it was in the minor leagues or whatever, I was constantly trying to get better and constantly trying to get here. But I never really took it as, 'Hey, I'm 25, I'm 26, I'm not there yet.' It's just one of those things you take it year by year, get better and eventually if I'm good enough it will happen.  The Rays acquired Kittredge from Seattle on Nov. 18, 2016, as part of a five-player trade. RF Steven Souza Jr. hit his 19th home run of the season, an ongoing career high, in a 3-2 victory against Oakland on Monday night. Souza hit a solo shot leading off the second inning. He lined RHP Daniel Gossett's 1-1 pitch to left field, above the out-of-town scoreboard at the Oakland Coliseum. He hit 17 home runs last season, which was a career high. RHP Jake Odorizzi (6-4) allowed one run on one hit over seven innings in a 3-2 victory against Oakland on Monday night. Odorizzi struck out five, walked two and gave up a home run in his 14th consecutive appearance, an ongoing franchise record.  It's just nice to get back to what I feel I'm capable of doing,  said Odorizzi, who struggled in the first half.  It was a frustrating first half, that's for sure, and that kind of helps ease those troubles when you come out and just do what I'm used to doing. Granted, the one hit, I'm not going to do that every time, let's be honest, but it was just good to execute pitches. I was on top of balls, offspeed was better, fastball location was much better and I wasn't constantly throwing balls in the top of the zone. Just a little adjustment I made really helped out. It was just nice to get back to being me again.  The biggest adjustment Odorizzi made was pitching out of the stretch for the entire game after walking leadoff hitter Matt Joyce.  I felt more comfortable,  Odorizzi said.  I don't know why, but I'm going to continue doing it. Once I walked Joyce I was in the stretch for the rest of the game because I felt better. I felt everything was just a little more crisp and I was able to get the ball down in the zone better.  RHP Jumbo Diaz was designated for assignment. He went 1-4 with a 5.70 ERA in 31 relief appearances for the Rays this season. Diaz had 28 strikeouts but also 15 walks 30 innings. 3B Evan Longoria went 2-for-4 with a solo home run, his 14th of the season, in a 3-2 victory against Oakland on Monday night. Longoria extended his hitting streak to 10 games.  I feel like I'm not up there fighting my swing,  Longoria said.  Until the last month, it's been a battle just to feel good going into the box.  C Wilson Ramos (sore left hamstring) missed his third straight game Monday night against Oakland but is making progress in his recovery and might return to the starting lineup Tuesday, Rays manager Kevin Cash said.  We're excited that he's feeling better, that's for sure,  Cash said.  Yesterday he did a pretty complete workout as far as taking swings, did some catching drills. He's getting better, he's getting better.  2B Tim Beckham was ejected by home plate umpire Lance Barrett after the top of the fourth inning. Beckham had struck out looking in the fourth, on a pitch that appeared to be high, and disputed the call as he walked back to the dugout. He continued arguing as he was taking his position in the field and was ejected for the first time of his career. INF Trevor Plouffe, who was traded by Oakland to Tampa Bay on June 17 after being designated for assignment, replaced Beckham. Plouffe made his first appearance at second base since April 24, 2012.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-rays-playerwatch-idUSMTZED7IAPXQF5"},

Great experience for him, batting behind Joey (Votto).  Winker walked as a pinch-hitter on Monday, but with catcher Devin Mesoraco on the mend and right-hander Sal Romano returning to start Tuesday's game, it's likely Winker's stay in the big leagues will be brief. RHP Asher Wojciechowski took over for Scott Feldman in the second inning on Monday and limited the Washington Nationals to one hit in 4 2/3 innings before Brian Goodwin hit a solo home run with two outs in the sixth to make the score 6-1. He kept the Washington off-balance, getting seven outs on popouts, and finished with three walks and four strikeouts after 70 pitches. Wojciechowski could take Feldman's spot in the rotation if he lands on the DL with right knee stiffness. RHP Anthony DeSclafani is preparing to take a big step in his recovery from an elbow injury suffered late in spring training. DeSclafani will throw a two-inning simulated game on Tuesday. If it goes well, he will throw three innings on July 23 in the Arizona rookie league, then be put on an every-fifth day throwing schedule. Reds manager Bryan Price said he watched DeSclafani throw on the side at Chase Field before the All-Star break and said he  threw beautifully.

Some sliders that were well thrown and executed and others that just spun. I think it's just mechanics based. Still finding his way with his delivery.

He reached double digits in just 40 games, the fastest a Cardinals rookie has hit 10 homers since former 1B Albert Pujols hit 10 homers in his first 30 games in 2001. In addition, DeJong has homered in a franchise-record four straight games against the Mets.

Wacha earned the victory on July 6, when he gave up two runs on six hits and two walks while tying a season high by striking out nine over 5 2/3 innings as the Cardinals beat 4-3. It was the second straight start in which Wacha struck out nine batters. Wacha has a 1.53 ERA over his last three starts, a stretch in which he's lowered his overall ERA from 4.76 to 4.10. He hasn't lost in his last seven starts, during which he is 4-0 with a 4.25 ERA. Wacha is 3-1 with a 2.74 ERA in four career starts against the Mets.

Before his injury, Glover had eight saves while going 0-1 with a 5.12 ERA in 23 appearances. RHP Stephen Strasburg never has fared well in hot weather, so much so that trainers have developed a hydration process for the Washington Nationals right-hander. On Monday afternoon in Cincinnati, the game-time temperature was 85, but Strasburg managed to keep his cool through seven innings. A five-run first inning in the 6-1 win provide plenty of run support for Strasburg (10-3), who gave up one run and four hits. He struck out 11 for his sixth 10-plus strikeout game of the season and 35th of his career. Throughout Monday's game, trainers provided Strasburg with continual fluids on the bench. The special mixture appears to be working.  The training staff really kind of put their heads together and got a good (hydration) system for me,  Strasburg said.  It kind of takes the guesswork out of it and I can just focus on the game. It's a pretty good setup.

Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko rejected the idea, describing Alexander Zakharchenko, leader of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic (DNR), as part of  a puppet show , with Russia pulling his strings in order to relay a message. France and Germany, which are involved in diplomatic efforts to end the Ukraine crisis, also condemned the proposal. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Russian agencies that Zakharchenko's statement was Zakharchenko's own initiative and that the Kremlin had learned about it from media reports. Ukrainian officials contend that Russia wants to show the world, and the United States especially, that it can keep the crisis in a suspended state and deepen it if need be. A new U.S. envoy for the Ukraine crisis was appointed this month and Moscow and Washington are likely to start regularly engaging on the issue. Zakharchenko, who would scarcely have expected anything other than outright rejection from Kiev, said in a declaration that he and his allies were proposing a new state called Malorossiya (Little Russia) be set up with its capital in rebel-held Donetsk. Malorossiya was the term used to describe swaths of modern-day Ukraine when they were part of the Russian Empire in tsarist times and is one many Ukrainians today regard as offensive. Ukraine, a country of about 42.5 million people, declared independence from Moscow in 1991. A local resident sits in his house, which was damaged by a recent shelling, in the rebel-controlled city of Donetsk, Ukraine.Alexander Ermochenko We are proposing to residents of Ukraine a peaceful way out of a difficult situation without war. It's our last proposal,  Zakharchenko said in a statement. The new state would be federal, with regions enjoying a large degree of autonomy. He said the move was backed by delegates from various Ukrainian regions, but a statement from the neighboring rebel territory of the self-proclaimed Luhansk People's Republic said it had been unaware of the initiative and did not support it.  Sick Fantasies  His declaration cast a shadow over the faltering Minsk peace agreement between the rebels and the Ukrainian government, which has failed to quell fighting between the two sides and has only been partially implemented since a pro-Russian uprising erupted in eastern Ukraine in 2014. Russia denies accusations it has delivered arms and provided troops backing rebels in the industrial, largely Russian-speaking east. On Tuesday the Kremlin said it remained committed to the Minsk peace deal.  Yevhen Marchuk, Ukraine's representative in the talks on implementing the peace deal, told Ukrainian TV channel 112.ua that Zakharchenko's declaration would complicate negotiations and looked like a Russian attempt to sabotage the process. France condemned the idea and demanded Russia do more to prevent a further escalation. A German government spokeswoman also criticized the move, calling it  totally unacceptable .  Ukraine's top military commander, Viktor Muzhenko, said on social media that the Ukrainian people would  bury  Malorossiya, calling the plan one of the rebels'  sick fantasies .  Three former rebel leaders told Reuters in May that a top aide to Russian President Vladimir Putin decides how the pro-Moscow administration of eastern Ukraine is run and who gets what jobs there, challenging Kremlin denials that it calls the shots in the region.

Based on calculations of how many mosquitoes get onto commercial aircraft, how many are infected and how many survive long enough at the destination to bite someone, the study estimates human travelers are 200 times more likely to spread dengue virus and 1,000 times more likely to introduce P. falciparum, the parasite that causes malaria . “Pathogens such as the Zika virus and chikungunya have drawn a lot of interest lately and are showing up in travelers,” said senior study author Michael Johansson, a biologist at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Division of Vector-Borne Diseases in San Juan, Puerto Rico.  Insects that transport disease, such as mosquitoes, have been introduced via airlines to geographic areas where they didn’t previous live, the authors write in PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases. Airports have insect-elimination, or “disinsection,” policies mandated by the UN’s International Health Regulations. They typically use insecticides to try to kill insects in bags, cargo, containers and conveyor belts, but infections still occur. “We’ve had disinsection policies for a long time, which are targeted at mosquito species and agricultural pests,” Johansson told Reuters Health in a phone interview. “But we need to focus on ways to prevent the spread through humans.” The study team assessed scenarios for the spread of mosquito-borne diseases, focusing on areas where either malaria or dengue are “endemic,” or widespread, and places where the diseases are not endemic, but conditions are favorable for them to establish themselves. Based on past studies, the researchers calculated how many mosquitoes would likely be on any given plane, and how many of them would be infected with disease. For instance, the largest number of mosquitoes ever detected on a plane in past research is 17 Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes, the primary transmitters of malaria, the researchers note. For the current study, they estimated a 0.25 probability of any mosquito on a given flight, or an average of one mosquito on every fourth plane. They also calculated the infection rates for human travelers, likelihood of mosquito bites at the destination and probability of disease transmission to a new person. Even in the absence of mosquito control or disinsection on planes, humans were hundreds of times more likely to spread the diseases through travel. Overall, the probability that an airplane traveling from a mosquito-heavy area would lead to infection was extremely low. “We expected to find this, but we were surprised by the magnitude,” Johansson said. “We didn’t think it would be so obvious, and this was focusing on the worst-case scenarios.” Future studies should focus on preventing human transmission, he added. Policies around preventing the transportation of infected mosquitoes won’t likely work, the study authors conclude. “There may be a misperception about how pathogens disperse globally,” said Moritz Kraemer of Harvard Medical School in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study.  “With the increase in travel globally, infectious diseases spread quickly from one location to another,” he told Reuters Health by email.   Kraemer, who recently published a study in the journal Nature about the multiple introductions of Zika virus to Florida (go.nature.com/2tmKLJ4), suggests creating maps of the geographic areas where people are infected and their airports to better target disease. Pathways and directionality is also important, he added.  “One aspect that is still difficult to assess is which travelers are at highest risk of infection,” he said. “The most exciting thing about this study is that it shows the differences between dengue and malaria and the risk of mosquito versus human-driven importation.” SOURCE: bit.ly/2uzjUJf PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases, online July 3, 2017.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-mosquitoes-disease-transmissio-idUSKBN1A31Y4"},

Chief Executive Officer Brian Moynihan spoke glowingly of a broad turnaround in the consumer business that began in 2009, calling its $2 billion in quarterly profit a  milestone  on a call with analysts on Tuesday. In the midst of the Great Recession, the unit had 6,000 financial centers, 100,000 employees, two-thirds the amount of deposits and little in the way of digital banking capabilities. Regulatory changes put into place following the 2008 financial crisis soon began to curtail revenue, as did strategic decisions like cutting back on business generated from third parties. The business recently has been benefiting from the cost cuts as well as improved technology, growth in deposits and a focus on higher-quality borrowers, Moynihan said.  In the second quarter, the division managed to increase deposits at a lower cost and use those cheaper funds to fuel loan growth, helping it to record a higher profit than any other unit. Overall, Bank of America hit a target of spending 60 cents for every dollar of revenue it produces, down from 63 cents a year earlier. Investors have been watching that metric closely as a sign of how efficiently the bank is run. Bank of America, the second-largest U.S. lender by assets,  is working to cut annual operating expenses to $53 billion next year. Consumer banking helped Bank of America deliver net income of $4.9 billion, or 46 cents per share, up 11 percent from the year-ago period. Analysts had been expecting 43 cents, on average, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The bank's total revenue of $23.07 billion also beat the average analyst estimate of $21.78 billion.  This was a good quarter all around for BofA,  said Evercore ISI analyst Glenn Schorr.  You really have to look hard to find a few issues to talk about.  Moynihan and Chief Financial Officer Paul Donofrio both characterized the second quarter as one of the best in the bank's history. But its stock was down 1.1 percent at $23.75 at midday, following a 8.4 percent year-to-date rise through Monday's close. Even as big banks have reported better results, investors have been disappointed that profits are not growing faster. Last week, shares of JPMorgan Chase & Co, Wells Fargo & Co and Citigroup Inc each fell after beating analysts' estimates, as did Goldman Sachs Group Inc on Tuesday. Bank of America's profit and revenue beats were overshadowed by net interest income falling short of expectations, analysts said. That metric, which rose 8.6 percent to $10.99 billion during the second quarter, helps gauge the difference between a bank's cost of funding and the income it generates from those funds. Bank of America is considered the most interest-rate sensitive among big U.S. banks because of the way its balance sheet is constructed in terms of loan maturities, types of funding and hedges. Apart from its global markets unit, which suffered a downturn in trading like other Wall Street banks, Bank of America's other business lines also produced higher profits. Wealth and investment management reported record net income of $804 million, and a record pretax profit margin of 28 percent. Both the wealth business and retail brokerage, which sits inside the consumer business, attracted more assets. Global banking also earned more money, with growth in corporate and commercial loans, more revenue from transaction services and higher investment banking fees related to those customers. Non-interest expenses rose 1.7 percent, partly due to charges related to closing data centers.

The legislation puts California at the forefront of plans by mostly Democratic governors to reduce carbon emissions and adhere to the goals of the Paris climate change agreement even after Republican President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from the pact. Brown and other state Democratic leaders have vowed to make California the leader in opposing the environmental policy of Trump, who has rolled back the programs of his predecessor, Barack Obama. The new California legislation emerged from long negotiations, although only a single Republican joined Democrats in voting in favor of the legislative package in the state Senate on Monday afternoon. Hours later, the Assembly voted 55 to 21 to send the legislation to Brown.     Tonight, California stood tall and once again, boldly confronted the existential threat of our time. Republicans and Democrats set aside their difference, came together and took courageous action. That's what good government looks like,  Brown said in a statement. Speaking in opposition, State Senator Andy Vidak said the laws represented a  regressive  tax that would not make any impact on climate change. FILE PHOTO - California Governor Jerry Brown speaks in Sacramento, California, U.S. on January 9, 2014.Max Whittaker/File Photo We could shut down the entire state of California and it would have no effect on the global climate,  Vidak said. The legislation extends California's cap-and-trade program, which was set to expire in three years, through 2030 and attempts to strengthen it by requiring large industrial facilities to upgrade old equipment with cleaner, more modern technology by 2023.  California's cap-and-trade plan sets a state limit on emissions of greenhouse gases and lets companies, such as factories and refineries, buy and sell permits to emit carbon dioxide. The system uses market forces to find the most efficient ways to cut pollution, supporters say. The new package seeks to reform the state's existing cap-and-trade market by curbing the number of free carbon allowances by 40 percent by 2030 and requiring that offsets be sourced from California, not elsewhere.  Despite holding a supermajority, Democrats had failed in previous attempts to pass new cap-and-trade legislation over opposition from more liberal members of the party who felt it did not go far enough and moderates concerned about the impact on business. Republicans were largely united in opposing the legislation, saying it places unfair burdens on consumers and employers, especially on top of a 12-cents-a-gallon gasoline tax hike passed by state lawmakers earlier this year.

Results in the survey are in line with what Fed officials have hinted at in recent weeks, even as they are split on the outlook for inflation and how the lack of it might affect the future pace of interest rate hikes.  The idea is that they (the Fed) announce balance sheet shrinkage at the September meeting and then hike in December. I think they have almost pre-announced those two decisions,  said Ethan Harris, head of global economics at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. In a poll conducted just last month, predictions were for the Fed to raise rates by September. But expectations have now been pushed back by a quarter, with the consensus from the latest poll of over 100 economists predicting the fed funds rate to climb to a range of 1.25-1.50 percent by the end of this year. Financial markets are pricing in only a 43 percent chance of a 25 basis point rate hike in December. That is largely because recent U.S. economic data have been weaker than expected, especially inflation. The dollar too has taken a beating against a basket of currencies and was last trading near a 10-month low. The Fed has raised rates twice so far this year. So while the Fed pauses for the next opportunity to raise rates, about two-thirds of economists say the central bank is expected to announce the course of action it will take to unwind its massive bonds portfolio in September. Most of those who answered another question in the poll said if the Fed does so, it will not be acting too soon. (For a graphic on those expectations: reut.rs/2txiV89) But not everyone was convinced.  We are a little bit concerned that the Fed is getting ahead of itself. We don't agree with the idea that the Fed seems to be selling that balance sheet shrinkage is something we should not be focused on, and it will simply occur in the background,  said BofA-ML's Harris. FILE PHOTO: A police officer keeps watch in front of the U.S. Federal Reserve building in Washington, DC, U.S. on October 12, 2016.Kevin Lamarque/File Photo In a sense, they are setting aside one of their policy tools on auto-pilot. I don't think they should be doing that.  Only a handful of economists expect the central bank to announce its balance sheet unwinding plan when it meets on July 25-26. The consensus was for the central bank to stand pat on rates too at that meeting. Inflation Outlook Slips The labor market remains strong, with the unemployment rate at 4.4 percent. But weak wage growth and cooling inflation will probably keep the Fed wary of raising rates again soon. The Reuters poll consensus for core PCE inflation, the gauge the Fed closely watches, was 1.5-1.6 percent each quarter from here until the end of the year, slightly lower than 1.6-1.7 percent expected last month. Growth has not picked up as previously thought either and is now expected to be modest at best for this year and next.  The economy is forecast to have grown at a 2.7 percent pace  in the second quarter and then to advance at an annualized rate of 2.2-2.5 percent each quarter to the end of next year, according to the poll median. Fed Chair Janet Yellen said at a Senate committee hearing last week that it would be  quite challenging  for the United States to reach the 3 percent growth target set by President Donald Trump's administration. Several Reuters polls this year have been clear that the chances of 3 percent U.S. economic growth this year were low. While the Fed has been more sanguine than markets about inflation picking up, policymakers will move cautiously.  Fed officials believe that market participants are underappreciating the inflation implications of the downtrend in the unemployment rate, and that they have overreacted to some weaker-than-expected inflation data,  noted Jim O'Sullivan of High Frequency Economics, the top forecaster for U.S. economic data in Reuters polls in 2016 for the second year in a row.  However, Fed officials will not follow through on their policy projections if the labor market weakens and the recent slowing in core inflation continues,  O'Sullivan wrote in a note.

The FTSE 100 ended down 0.2 percent but outperformed heavy losses among European stocks thanks to a weaker pound, which benefits major exporting companies. Sterling dropped as investors adjusted interest rate expectations after inflation unexpectedly eased in June for the first time since October, surprising the market and adding to the likelihood the Bank of England will keep interest rates on hold in August.  The Bank of England's rhetoric has taken an increasingly hawkish tone in recent weeks,  Hargreaves Lansdown senior economist Ben Brettell said.  However if today's pullback in inflation marks the start of a sustained decline, the pressure on the Bank to raise rates will ease.  Mid-cap IG Group soared more than 16 percent and was the top European gainer after the online spreadbetting company reported a growing client base and rising profit despite quiet markets.  We regard these as very solid results in a year where market volatility has been at a multi-year low,  Shore Capital analysts said. Greater market volatility tends to bolster trading companies' profits as investors turn investment portfolios around more frequently. Britain's second-largest listed property developer British Land was a top blue-chip performer after it announced a 300 million pound share buyback plan, providing more evidence of a pick-up in share buybacks among European corporates. Morgan Stanley analysts last week predicted this trend would accelerate.  Given the significant discount to net asset value (NAV) at which the shares are trading, this would be NAV accretive with the scale of enhancement subject to the amount of share bought and at what price,  analysts at Stifel said. A flurry of mail activity around the British election helped Royal Mail to perform more strongly in its first quarter, sending its shares up 3.1 percent to join the FTSE 100 index's top gainers.

The Milwaukee-based motorcycle maker also said it would need to cut production in second half of 2017, resulting in hourly workforce reductions at some of its U.S. plants. Harley's shares were down 9 percent at $47.17 in late morning trading on Tuesday. While demand for new models has waned, the company has also taken a hit from used motorcycles being sold off by aging customers. For the full year, Harley said it expects to ship 241,000 to 246,000 motorcycles, compared with 262,221 a year earlier. The company had previously forecast shipments to be flat to modestly down. That's a far cry from the nearly 350,000 it shipped a year about a decade ago.  We are downgrading Harley-Davidson to 'market-perform' based on increased conviction that motorcycle demand in the United States is in the throes of secular erosion,  Bernstein analyst David Beckel said. Beckel noted that the  Generation Y  - those born in the 1980s and early 1990s - was adopting motorcycling at a far lower rate than prior generations. Like other companies in the manufacturing industry, Harley was widely expected to benefit from President Donald Trump's proposals to boost infrastructure spending and cut taxes. A Harley-Davidson bike is displayed in their office in Singapore October 13, 2016.Edgar Su/File Photo The hoped-for drivers of incremental Trump-related demand – infrastructure spending, middle class tax cuts, corporate tax cuts, domestic production advantages – are all on hold, perhaps indefinitely,  Bernstein analyst David Beckel said. Harley is also up against aggressive discounting by rivals such as Polaris Industries Inc (PII.N), the maker of the Indian bike, and Japan's Honda Motor Co Ltd (7267.T). The company said it expected to ship 39,000 to 44,000 motorcycles in the current quarter, suggesting a decline of up to 20 percent. Retail motorcycle sales fell 9.3 percent in the United States, its biggest market, and 6.7 percent globally in the second quarter ended June 25. Harley said its share in the U.S. big-bike market fell to 48.5 percent from 49.5 percent a year earlier. The company now expects 2017 operating margin to be down about 1 percentage point. It had previously forecast operating margin to be in line with 2016. Net income fell 7.7 percent to $258.9 million, or $1.48 per share. Revenue per motorcycle rose about $437 to $15,530 in the quarter, but revenue from motorcycles and related products fell about 5.6 percent to $1.58 billion.

Speaking in parliament, Hariri described the operation planned for the Juroud Arsal area as carefully studied, the National News Agency reported. The government had given the army the  freedom  to act, he added. Juroud Arsal, a barren area in the mountains between Syria and Lebanon, has been a base of operations for insurgents fighting in the Syrian civil war, including jihadists from Islamic State and the group formerly known as the Nusra Front. Rights group Amnesty International urged the army not to use excessive force in the operation in an area where many Syrian refugees live in crowded camps. Speculation has been building that the powerful Lebanese group Hezbollah and the Syrian military are set to mount a major operation against the insurgents on the Syrian side of the frontier. Earlier this month, Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said time was running out for Syrian militants along the border near Arsal to reach deals with Syrian authorities, saying it was  high time to end the threat of militant groups in Arsal .

A security source said the Lebanese army, a recipient of U.S. and British military aid, had increased its deployment in the Arsal area in the last 24 hours. The source said the militants in the Juroud Arsal area were estimated to number around 3,000, two-thirds of them belonging to Islamic State or the group formerly known as the Nusra Front, and the remainder members of other rebel groups. The Arsal area is home to thousands of Syrian refugees who were recently caught up in raids on camps as security forces searched for militants. Hariri said in a statement later on Tuesday that the army was separately investigating the  deaths of Syrians in Arsal , an apparent reference to the deaths in army custody of several Syrians earlier this month. In 2014, the Arsal area was the scene of one of the most serious spillovers of the Syrian war into Lebanon, when jihadists briefly overran the town of Arsal. The Iran-backed Shi'ite group Hezbollah has provided Syrian President Bashar al-Assad with crucial military support in the war, a role that has drawn heavy criticism from its Lebanese opponents including Hariri.

The state-owned airline has also put fleet expansion on hold, scrapping a proposal to lease eight Boeing (BA.N) 787 wide-body aircraft, said one of the officials, a senior Air India employee who requested anonymity as the plans are not public. Air India's board approved that proposal in April but nothing further had been done.  Nothing has been finalised but our aim is to make the strategic sale as simple as we can,  the company official said, adding that any fresh investment would also be put on hold. Air India spokesman Dhananjay Kumar said the company had not offered employees voluntary buyouts. India's flag carrier is on the block after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's cabinet last month approved plans to privatize the loss-making airline by selling part or all of the company and ending decades of state support. Founded in the 1930s and known to generations of Indians for its Maharajah mascot, Air India has a complex fleet, too many staff relative to rivals and $8.5 billion in debt. Since 2012, New Delhi has injected $3.6 billion to keep it afloat. An official in Modi's office said the prime minister, under pressure to cut spending and boost basic infrastructure such as ports and roads, was in  no mood  to provide fresh monetary assistance to any loss-making public sector company. The two government sources, who are familiar with Air India's plans, said top officials in the civil aviation ministry and at Air India had been asked to present a report on how a Voluntary Retirement Scheme (VRS) could be offered to some 15,000 of Air India's 40,000 staff, including contractors. Many of the contractors, including office staff and ground handlers, have worked for the airline for years, and would need to be given buyout offers to prevent protests from them, said the senior company official, who is involved in the airline's daily operations.     Previous attempts to offload the airline have failed mainly because of the scale and complexity of Air India's problems, as well as its influential unions. If Modi can pull the privatization off it will buttress his credentials as a reformer brave enough to wade into some of the country's most intractable problems. Separately on Tuesday, Air India Chairman Ashwani Lohani sent a letter to employees assuring them the government and the airline management  would like to safeguard your genuine and valid interests , according to a copy of the letter seen by Reuters. Kumar, the company spokesman, confirmed the letter.   Air India employees hold placards as they shout slogans during a protest against the proposed privatisation of Air India by the government, in New Delhi, India July 18, 2017.Adnan AbidiUnited Front In its heyday, Air India boasted a talent pool that newly founded airlines dipped into.     The government will need to convince seven trade unions to accept the plan to make the airline attractive to potential buyers, including buyouts and other efforts to slash costs. Their initial response was not positive.      The government will propose a VRS scheme and we will throw their proposal in the dustbin,  said J.B. Kadian, leader of a union that represents 8,000 non-technical Air India staff.     FILE PHOTO: An Air India Airlines Boeing 787 dreamliner takes part in a flying display during the 50th Paris Air Show at the Le Bourget airport near Paris, June 14, 2013.Pascal Rossignol/File PhotoKadian said a joint forum of unions representing Air India employees would launch an  agitation  in August if the government pursues its privatization plans. On Tuesday, dozens of members of the Air Corporations Employees' Union gathered near Delhi airport holding placards and shouting slogans opposing the privatization and demanding the airline's debt be written off, marking the first protest against the government's plan. A committee of five senior federal ministers, led by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, is expected to meet this month and begin ironing out the finer details of the privatization plan. In the meantime, Civil Aviation Minister Ashok Gajapathi Raju said he wanted Air India to begin cutting at all levels. Earlier this month, the airline decided to stop serving non-vegetarian meals in economy class on domestic flights in a bid to save up to 100 million rupees ($1.6 million) over 10 months. The action provoked uproar on social media and was belittled by aviation experts, who argue that Air India's management needs a massive structural overhaul, tackling thornier issues such as its fleet and staff, rather than meals.   The airline is also working to reduce the time its planes spend on the ground and launching direct flights to new international destinations. In July, Air India started a direct flight to Washington and will start flying to Stockholm, Copenhagen and Los Angeles later this year.      Keeping planes in the hangar makes no sense when Air India is trying to find new sources of income. We should optimize the use of all possible resources,  Raju said.  The idea is to present a robust company to potential buyers.

The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) appealed to donors for funds to provide  meaningful alternatives  for people taking dangerous boat journeys to reach Europe. More than 110,000 migrants and refugees have arrived by sea in southern Europe so far this year, including 92,000 in Italy, it said. At least 2,360 have died at sea and an unknown number have perished in the Sahara desert trying to reach Libya.   People should not go to Libya. We have no idea about the number of people losing their lives in those detention centers run by traffickers,  Vincent Cochetel, UNHCR Special Envoy for the Central Mediterranean situation, told a news briefing.  But when you interview the people in Italy, you just hear horror stories about people missing.  Italy is considering issuing temporary visas that would allow migrants to travel around the European Union, its deputy foreign minister said on Tuesday, a move intended to pressure its EU neighbors to do more to help ease the migration crisis.  The UNHCR expanded its appeal to $421 million to finance its strategy in countries of origin and transit in sub-Saharan Africa, in North Africa and in destination countries in Europe.  Some 7,000 to 9,000 migrants and refugees are held in Libya at any time, including in detention centers, Cochetel said.  The rest of the people in Libya are often kept in what are called 'connection houses' or warehouses where they are kept by the traffickers and are subject often to all sorts of abuse.   We believe that the situation is not unavoidable. We believe that once the people are in Libya it's a bit too late in many respects,  he said. In sub-Saharan African countries including Niger, UNHCR aims to help asylum seekers gain access to asylum procedures and to raise awareness of the risks of traveling to Libya, he said.   So what we are proposing... is a surge of activities that provide adequate reception, decent reception conditions as well as other services so people have a real alternatives to stay in those countries of transit and have their case, their application, examined in those countries,  he said.

With the huge number of people crossing the Mediterranean from North Africa increasing, Italy complains that its European partners are not sharing the load. Asked whether migrants could be given the temporary permits, Deputy Foreign Minister Mario Giro told left-wing newspaper Il Manifesto the government was looking at all possibilities.  We are in a tug of war,  Giro said in the interview which was posted on the Foreign Ministry's website.  He said Italy wanted to avoid unilateral gestures, but is against the strict application of EU law which keeps migrants in their first country of arrival.  We don't accept being turned into a European hotspot, or feeling guilty because we rescue people, so deciding what to do with the migrants who arrive is everyone's responsibility,  Giro said.

It was too early to say when or how many such permits could be issued, Giro said, adding that the Italian authorities who receive asylum requests already have the power to grant them.  A day earlier, Foreign Minister Angelino Alfano had said the temporary visas were not on the government's agenda.   Italy angered many EU governments with a decision to offer residence permits to migrants in 2011 when violence in North Africa sent thousands fleeing to Europe.  Issuing them again would put pressure on other countries to help, said Enzo Bianco, mayor of the Sicilian port town of Catania, where 10,000 migrants rescued off the coast of Libya have been brought so far in 2017.  We are allowed to use these tools, and it's a good thing to remind Europe about its duty to be more responsible,  Bianco, a former interior minister and member of the ruling Democratic Party (PD), told Reuters in a telephone interview.

The pan-European STOXX 600 was down 0.3 percent as the basic resources sector fell more than 1 percent. Ericsson dropped 11 percent after cutting its forecast for the mobile infrastructure market and reporting a wider than expected loss, a further blow to a company that is undertaking cost cuts.  A more challenging market and consensus estimates likely to fall significantly for 2017, we believe, will weigh,  said UBS analysts. Nokia shares fell 2.9 percent as investors read across to the Finnish mobile equipment maker. Banks were down 0.5 percent, after comments from Federal Reserve and European Central Bank policymakers that pointed to a slower rate of tightening on both sides of the Atlantic than many investors were expecting. Zalando weighed on the retail index after it reported slowing sales growth. Europe's biggest online-only  fashion retailer said capacity issues at new warehouses held them back. Zalando launched a loyalty program, Zalando Zet, which analysts at Baader Helvea said was its answer to Amazon Prime. The broader euro zone earnings picture was expected to weaken slightly in the third quarter as analysts see a stronger currency likely weighing on the bloc's large exporting companies.   We do think that the scope for earnings to beat expectations has been reduced due to the currency headwinds - historically euro weakness has provided a driver for earnings beats and with that removed, expectations may be more difficult to surpass,  said Edward Park, investment director at Brooks Macdonald.  German airline Lufthansa fell 2 percent from 10-year highs, the worst DAX performer, despite upping its profit forecast after a bumper summer of bookings.  Traders had expected the stock to rise 1 to 2 percent. Analysts at Liberum said cautious second-half comments from management might explain the move lower. UK peers International Consolidated Air and EasyJet were among top FTSE 100 losers. Norwegian fertilizer company Yara fell 4 percent after its quarterly earnings were dented by a squeeze in margins.  We believe this has been Yara's darkest quarter and see an improving trend with urea prices ticking up in the U.S. and Egypt recently,  said Liberum analysts.  Among shares boosting the index, British spread-betting firm IG Group was up 8 percent, leading gainers after reporting an increase in annual profit that beat analysts' estimates. Britain's second largest listed property developer British Land jumped 2.7 percent and was among the top performers on the STOXX 600 after announcing a 300 million pound share buyback.  Analysts at Morgan Stanley last week predicted European share buybacks would accelerate as corporates react to a happy combination of better economic growth and solid balance sheets.

In a congressional hearing before a House Financial Services Committee subcommittee, officials from the New York Stock Exchange (ICE.N), the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, biotechnology firm aTyr Pharma Inc (LIFE.O) and a free-market advocacy group urged Congress and the Securities and Exchange Commission to loosen rules on a wide variety of areas, from auditing and shareholder proposals, to proxy advisory firms.  Like straw upon a camel’s back, the burdens and reporting requirements associated with being a public company have steadily accumulated over the years,  said Tom Quaadman, an executive vice president at the U.S. Chamber's Center for Capital Market Competitiveness, in prepared remarks. For years, corporate interests have called for scaling back a variety of rules for public companies with little success.  But now, their hopes have been renewed after President Donald Trump nominated Wall Street deal-making attorney Jay Clayton to lead the SEC. Clayton has said he plans to look for ways to ease compliance costs and disclosure burdens that may be deterring companies from going public, or incentivizing them to stay private longer. In testimony Tuesday, New York Stock Exchange President Thomas Farley urged policymakers to do away with a Sarbanes-Oxley-era rule requiring public company auditors to attest to the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting.  Public companies are devoting more time and resources than ever to grapple with administrative procedures and controls,  Farley said. Executives also called for rules to restrict shareholder proposals and limit the powers of proxy advisory firms Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis, which help large institutional investors weigh how to vote on issues like board elections.  Proxy advisory firms should be more transparent and open to input in their standard-setting processes, particularly with regard to issues unique to small businesses,  said John Blake, a senior vice president of finance at aTyr Pharma. Although the bulk of Tuesday's hearing focused on proposals to scale back the SEC's rules, one witness cautioned against going too far. J. Robert Brown, Jr., a professor at the University of Denver Sturm College of Law, warned that efforts to eliminate auditor attestation rules could lead to more accounting errors.  Studies indicate that companies not subject to the attestation requirement have a higher rate of restatements,  he said. Reporting by Sarah N.

Until 2010, life expectancy at birth was rising by one year every five years for women, and by one year every three and a half years for men.  But since 2010, the average rate of increase has halved, and in 2013-15 it was near zero, a report by the Institute of Health Equity found. Its author, Michael Marmot, professor of public health at University College London, said the findings were historically unusual, and worrying.  What we had expected over time - this relentless increase in life expectancy, (and) improvement in health - has stalled,  he told BBC radio.  The average life expectancy for men born in 2010 was 78.7 years, rising to 79.6 years by 2015, whilst female life expectancy increased from 82.6 to 83.1 years over the same period.  Life expectancy has grown decade-on-decade since 1890, although there have been occasional annual drops, notably in the First and Second World Wars. Marmot did not establish a direct cause for the levelling-off, but said it was  entirely possible  that there was a link with austerity policies that have seen per capita healthcare spending fall in real terms since 2010, along with a rise in dementia cases.

Earlier this month North Korea said it had conducted its first test of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), and that it had mastered the technology to mount a nuclear warhead on the missile. But General Paul Selva, speaking before the Senate Armed Services Committee, said the July 4th test stopped short of showing North Korea had  the capacity to strike the United States with any degree of accuracy or reasonable confidence of success.   Pyongyang's state media said the test successfully verified the atmospheric re-entry of the warhead, which experts say may be able to reach the U.S. state of Alaska.   What the experts tell me is that the North Koreans have yet to demonstrate the capacity to do the guidance and control that would be required,  said Selva, the second highest-ranking U.S. military official. South Korea's intelligence agency also does not believe North Korea has secured re-entry capabilities for its ICBM program. South Korea on Monday proposed military talks with North Korea, the first formal overture to Pyongyang by the government of President Moon Jae-in, to discuss ways to avoid hostile acts near the heavily militarized border. The United States has remained technically at war with North Korea since the 1950-53 Korean conflict ended in an armistice rather than a peace treaty and the past six decades have been punctuated by periodic rises in antagonism and rhetoric that have always stopped short of a resumption of active hostilities. Tensions have risen sharply after North Korea conducted two nuclear weapons tests last year and carried out a steady stream of ballistic missile tests. When asked about preemptive military operations against North Korea, Selva said he believed that  we have to entertain that potential option.   We need to think seriously about what the consequences of that action might be,  Selva said.

Benchmark zinc prices on the London Metal Exchange surged 60 percent last year after the shutdown of major mines around the world and suspensions at others raised the prospect of deep deficits. But at $2,769 a tonne, LME prices have only added 8 percent so far in 2017 and have failed to push above last year's peak of just under $3,000 a tonne. Bullish investors had expected shortages to develop in top consumer China, where physical market premiums in Shanghai surged to $195 a tonne in June, the highest since 2013, but they have since retreated to $175.  We think the second-half 2017 fundamental outlook for zinc looks less supportive, easing supply constraints and questionable demand strength,  JP Morgan analyst Natasha Kaneva wrote in a note. JP Morgan last week advised clients to take a short position in zinc, targeting a decline to $2,400.  Producer Selling Despite the closures of the huge Century mine in Australia and Lisheen in Ireland, together with mine suspensions from major producer Glencore, world zinc output rose 6.3 percent in the first five months of 2017, according to the International Zinc and Lead Study Group. [nL8N1K839F] Hedging by producers was probably partly behind a retreat in prices on Tuesday and more forward selling is likely, said Robin Bhar, head of metals research at Societe Generale. Major zinc producer Nyrstar announced on July 6 that it had put in place first-half 2018 hedging for 70 percent of the refined metal it will produce. [nGNE4hHx84]    There's always the danger that the market will be capped by producer selling and that hidden inventories will seep out, that's a perennial problem,  said Bhar, who forecast that third-quarter LME prices would average $2,520 a tonne. In addition to 368,569 tonnes of zinc stored in warehouses registered by the LME, the Shanghai Futures Exchange (ShFE) and the CME, analysts estimate there are up to 1.5 million tonnes of additional metal in other depots around the world. After declines in LME and ShFE inventories for most of the year, they have increased recently. Since last week, on-warrant LME stocks - those that are not earmarked for delivery and therefore available to investors - have nearly doubled and last week ShFE zinc stocks jumped 16.2 percent.   The unwinding of the current ShFE short squeeze should trigger large-scale profit taking and the release of zinc physical ingot inventories presently controlled by the longs,  Citi analysts said in a note.

Fitch Ratings has affirmed UAE-based Emirates Islamic  Bank's (EI) Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A+' with Stable Outlook, Short-Term IDR  at 'F1' and Support Rating (SR) at '1'. The Viability Rating (VR) has also been affirmed at 'bb-'. A full list of rating actions is at the end of this rating action commentary. KEY RATING DRIVERS IDRs, SR AND DEBT EI's IDRs and SR reflect Fitch's view that EI is a key and integral subsidiary of its 99.9% shareholder, Emirates NBD (ENBD; A+/Stable/F1). ENBD's IDRs are based on potential support available from the UAE and Dubai authorities, if need be. In Fitch's view, this support would flow through to EI given EI's role and track record in the group (offering retail, SME and small corporate Islamic finance services for the group), the very high reputational risk to ENBD of an EI default, as well as the Central Bank of United Arab Emirates' (CBUAE) inclination to favour  support as EI operates in the same home market as ENBD. The three Sukuk issued by EI Sukuk Company Limited (100% owned subsidiary) are rated in line  with the bank's IDRs and are therefore subject to the same rating drivers. VR EI's VR reflects the bank's high impaired financing ratio, moderate capital ratios, variable profitability, acceptable management and strategy, and adequate funding and liquidity profile. EI's VR has been constrained by the bank's weak asset quality. EI's asset quality metrics have continued to show modest deterioration. The impaired financing ratio increased to 9.1% at end-2016 (8.8% at end-2015) with reserve coverage improving over the same period increasing to 97% from 90%. EI has a relatively diversified balance sheet through its focus on retail and SME financing. However, the financing book remains concentrated on single-name exposures (the top 20 exposures represented 1.1x of total equity at end-2016). EI's capital ratios (the Fitch Core Capital ratio was about 15% at end-2016) are now more in line with other Fitch-rated UAE banks. Improvement in EI's capital ratios during 2016 can be attributed to the parent's capital injection of AED1.5 billion via a rights issue, which is the second equally sized rights issue to take place in the last four years. At end-2016, the Tier 1 regulatory ratio was 14.9%. The total regulatory capital ratio was 16.1%. If capital above the minimum regulatory requirement is added to loss reserves, then the loss reserve/gross financing ratio increases to 13.3% from 8.8%, giving a moderate capital buffer. Earnings and profitability metrics have been variable and track below peers. Fitch's key earnings and profitability metric, operating profit/ risk weighted assets, demonstrates the variability of the bank's operating profitability, ranging from 0.2% to 1.5% over the last four years. Over the same period, UAE peers have demonstrated on average a stable 2.2% operating profit/ risk weighted assets. A combination of large financing impairment charges relative to operating profit, and an above average (but improving) cost to income ratio explains why EI's overall profitability has been and is likely to remain below the industry average. EI is largely funded by stable customer deposits, which accounted for about 82% of total non-equity funding at end-2016. The deposit base is less concentrated than peers due to its retail focus providing a stable funding base for the short to medium term. EI has complemented its deposit funding with three Sukuk issues, demonstrating good access to capital markets when required. EI has a large stock of liquid assets (cash and cash equivalents, short term interbank placement and liquid securities) equivalent to 40% of deposits, providing an adequate liquidity cushion. EI's financing to deposits ratio is in line with peers. In assessing EI's ratings, we considered important differences between Islamic and conventional banks. These factors include closer analysis of regulatory oversight, disclosure, accounting standards and corporate governance. Islamic banks' ratings do not express an opinion on the bank's compliance with sharia. Fitch will assess non-compliance with sharia if it has credit implications. RATING SENSITIVITIES IDRs, SR AND DEBT EI's IDRs and SR are sensitive to a change in ENBD's IDRs. Unless its importance to ENBD diminishes, EI's IDRs will remain equalised with ENBD's. As such, the Stable Outlook on EI's Long-Term IDR mirrors that on ENBD. In turn, ENBD's IDRs are sensitive to a change in the UAE and Dubai authorities' ability or propensity to provide support. The three Sukuks issued via EI Sukuk Company Limited are rated in line with EI's IDRs and are therefore subject to the same sensitivities. VR The upside for the VR could arise from improvements in the underlying asset quality and capital ratios. Further evidence of EI implementing its strategy and growing its financing book with no material deterioration in the bank's risk indicators would also contribute to an upgrade.

The pan-European STOXX 600 fell by more than 1 percent, snapping a four-day winning streak, with European banks down by 1.6 percent and lower bond trading revenue at Goldman Sachs adding to the selling pressure. Barclays and Deutsche Bank, which are also major players in the bond market, were top fallers on their respective indexes after the Goldman results. Although euro zone banks are the most favoured sector along with tech among global investors, according to the latest Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAML) survey of fund managers, comments from Federal Reserve and European Central Bank policymakers have triggered profit-taking in recent weeks. The comments point to a slower rate of tightening on both sides of the Atlantic than many investors were expecting.  The persistent overweight in Eurozone vs US equities could be more bad news for European investors,  strategists at BAML said, as that could leave them more vulnerable. Elsewhere, Ericsson fell by nearly 16 percent after cutting its forecast for the mobile infrastructure market and reporting a wider than expected loss, a further blow to a company that is undertaking cost cuts. Nokia fell 3.3 percent to the bottom of the CAC 40 as the Finnish mobile equipment maker's stock suffered too. Zalando weighed on the retail index with its shares down 8.3 percent after reporting slowing sales growth. Europe's biggest online-only fashion retailer said capacity issues at new warehouses had held it back. The broader euro zone earnings picture is expected to weaken slightly in the third quarter, with analysts expecting a stronger currency to weighing on the bloc's large exporters.  Historically euro weakness has provided a driver for earnings beats and with that removed, expectations may be more difficult to surpass,  Edward Park, investment director at Brooks Macdonald, said. German airline Lufthansa fell 1.2 percent from 10-year highs, the worst DAX performer, as cautious second-half comments overshadowed a profit forecast hike. Lufthansa's shares had gained nearly 70 percent this year to yesterday's close, among the best performing stocks in Europe. Norwegian fertiliser firm Yara fell 4 percent after quarterly earnings were dented by a margin squeeze.  We believe this has been Yara's darkest quarter and see an improving trend with urea prices ticking up in the U.S. and Egypt recently,  Liberum analysts said. Among shares boosting the index, British spread-betting firm IG Group soared more than 16 percent, leading the gainers after beating analysts' profit estimates. Property developer British Land jumped 3.1 percent and was among the top performers on the STOXX 600 after announcing a 300 million pound share buyback. Analysts at Morgan Stanley last week predicted European share buybacks would accelerate as corporates react to a better economic growth and solid balance sheets.

Two days before the start of his title defense at Royal Birkdale, Stenson said he had mixed feelings about the pressures of being the champion.  I never felt it was a big problem not having won one, even though I badly wanted to win one,  he told reporters.  But I never walked around feeling like, oh, I'm one of those guys on that list that potentially are the best players not to have won a major. I didn't really feel that part. Related CoverageNo-one will dominate again like Tiger says SpiethKoepka out to prove he's not a one-major wonder Once you win one, obviously that's off your shoulder. Given how long and successful a career I've had, I think that's pretty much what we're aiming for, a few more chances to win more major championships.  Stenson beat American Mickelson with a sparkling final round of 63 at Royal Troon 12 months ago, carding a record British Open score of 20 under par to become the first Scandinavian man to win a major. Although the 41-year-old missed the cut in this year's U.S. Masters and U.S. Open, he is confident of performing well at Birkdale a week after playing in the Scottish Open, usually a good omen for him.  Looking at my last four Open championships before this one, I went and played the Scottish Open twice, and finished second and first at the Open. And the two times I didn't go I finished around 40th,  said Stenson, who finished tied 26th at Dundonald on Sunday. Stenson has relished the responsibilities of carrying the Claret Jug around the world and he was sad to hand it back to the tournament organizers this week.  It had become like part of the family,  he said.  It's an iconic trophy. It's been the busiest year, but also the best year in my professional career. It was certainly a dream come true winning The Open Championship last year.  Stenson took the Claret Jug jet-skiing and if he repeats his triumph he has more unusual plans.  I'm going sky-diving with it,  he said.  And I don't know which is going to be harder, winning the Claret Jug again or going sky-diving afterwards, because that thought scares me a little bit. It won't stop me from trying to win it, though.  Editing by Larry King","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-golf-open-idUSKBN1A31QJ"},

Since the demise of Tiger Woods, and more recently Rory McIlroy, the last seven majors have seen first-time winners, including Koepka himself at Erin Hills in June, when he kept the coolest of heads for a 16-under total that tied McIlroy's record for lowest score in relation to par at the tournament. You have to go back two years to Zach Johnson's  British Open triumph at Saint Andrews, which came eight years after his 2007 Masters triumph. Since then Jason Day, Danny Willett, Dustin Johnson, Henrik Stenson, Jimmy Walker and Sergio Garcia have all proved one-hit wonders - so far - with Koepka seeking to avoid their fate. Unlike tennis, where Roger Federer bagged his eighth Wimbledon title at the age of 35, golf has seen a constant changing of the guard. Four-time major winner McIlroy, who last triumphed at the 2014 US PGA, predicts the era of the  dominant force is over.  Yeah, I agree with Rory,  said Koepka, whose only other PGA Tour win was at the 2015 Phoenix Open.  You look at how many good players there are. You look at how it was at Erin Hills.  Everyone up there hadn't won a major. Rickie (Fowler), Justin (Thomas), Hideki (Matsuyama), they haven't won majors, and I think everyone in this room knows they're going to win one. It's only a question of when, not if.  But the question for Koepka is can he do it again. At least the 27-year-old probably stands a better chance of winning than many of his compatriots because of his familiarity with links golf in Britain.  He spent his formative years on the Challenge Tour, the feeder circuit for the European Tour. When Zach Johnson won at Saint Andrews, Koepka produced a final-round 68 for a creditable joint 10th,   I love links golf. I think it's the best kind of golf,  he said.  So much imagination that goes into it. You can play ten different shots from the middle of the fairway and I think that's so cool. You've really got to be creative.  The Royal Birkdale course is set up to penalize the wild but reward the persistent, with light rough offering a chance to those who stray marginally off the fairways.   Playing over here for two years, you play a lot of links golf and you learn to love it and I have.  Koepka has enjoyed an astonishing progression since the 2013 British Open at Muirfield, which he reached after a 300-mile dash down from Scotland for the Sunningdale qualifying tournament, producing rounds of 69 and 65 after just two hours’ sleep. After two years scrambling to secure a future, successive steps up to the European and then PGA tours laid the foundations for his U.S. Open win. As if to remind him of that success, he will play with Matsuyama, runner up at Erin Hills, for the first two days, a pairing that will at least remind him of what is possible.      Anytime you play with Hideki, you know he's going to play well. Sometimes you can kind of feed off that and hopefully it does this week.  Koepka has taken an extended break since the U.S. Open but fully intends to resume where he left off.  I'm refreshed. I planned to take some time off and kind of regroup. But last week after July 4th it was kind of like, okay, I just want to get back out here, I want to play, I want to get inside the ropes. I'm really getting antsy.

The 2016 deal has been under public scrutiny since it emerged that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's personal lawyer also represented the local agent of the German conglomerate ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems set to build the vessels. A German government official said on Tuesday a signing ceremony for the deal had been put off, but gave no further details. The German Defence Ministry and Israeli Foreign Ministry declined comment. Israel's Channel 2 and the Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper both reported that Michael Ganor, an Israeli businessman who brokered the deal between Israel and ThyssenKrupp, and who police confirmed last week is being held in custody, was in discussions about becoming a state witness. A spokesman for the Israeli police said he could not confirm the reports and Ganor's lawyer declined via email to respond to questions submitted by Reuters. Yedioth Ahronoth reported that police had offered several suspects in the case a lighter sentence in exchange for evidence, and said talks with Ganor were  more advanced .  Israel opened the investigation into the deal following media reports that Netanyahu's lawyer, David Shimron, also represented Ganor, raising concerns of a conflict of interest. Shimron has denied wrongdoing and said he never discussed the deal with Netanyahu, who is also a distant relative. Netanyahu, who is not under investigation in the case, has given his full backing to his lawyer.   No Concrete Indications of Corruption  FILE PHOTO: Israel Navy soldiers stand on the Rahav, the fifth submarine in the fleet, as it docks in Haifa port, Israel January 12, 2016.Baz Ratner/File PhotoThyssenKrupp said on Tuesday its own six-month investigation into Ganor had found  no concrete indications of corruption  but added that the results were provisional because the company could not carry out investigations in Israel.  At the current moment in time, ThyssenKrupp is not the subject of German or Israeli investigations,  the company said in a statement.  Nevertheless, it is very important to us to get to the bottom of the allegations in Israel.  It said it had offered cooperation to the Israeli and German authorities and was following developments  very closely . The  submarines affair  involves not only Israel's decision to buy three new subs from ThyssenKrupp, the supplier of Israel's existing five-strong, nuclear-capable fleet, but the purchase of four patrol ships as well. Opposition politicians have said the contract for the patrol vessels should have been put out to tender rather than being awarded directly to the German shipbuilder. The government has said it followed the correct procedures in awarding the deal. While the Israeli media has been full of leaks and speculation around the case, the authorities have been far more circumspect as the investigation steadily proceeds.  On July 10, police said three suspects had been remanded in custody and a fourth put under house arrest, while six people in total had been questioned on suspicion of corruption. The six included public officials and private citizens, police spokeswoman Luba Simri said, adding that they had been questioned under caution on suspicion of bribery, fraud and tax-related offences. The submarines case is one of several high-level corruption investigations underway. Netanyahu has been questioned as a suspect in two criminal cases, one involving gifts received from businessmen and the other related to discussions he held with a newspaper publisher about more favorable coverage in exchange for curbs on newspaper competition. Netanyahu has denied wrongdoing in both cases.

Pollution from cars, including those with diesel engines, has become a sensitive subject in Germany since Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) admitted to systematic cheating of emissions tests to mask levels of health threatening nitrogen oxides.  Cities such as Munich and Stuttgart are looking at banning older diesel cars, whose emissions they blame for causing an increase in respiratory diseases. The Ifo study, published on Tuesday, said a switch to sales of zero-emission cars would threaten 426,000 car manufacturing jobs, with the rest coming from related industries, such as suppliers. Two months before Germany's national elections, the government faces growing pressure to reduce emissions or face complete bans on diesel cars in some cities. Representatives of federal and regional governments will meet with carmakers on Aug. 2 to find ways to curb diesel-related pollution. The VDA, representing carmakers such as Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE), Daimler (DAIGn.DE) and BMW (BMWG.DE), has already been talking to the government on steps to curb pollution from diesel cars that the industry hopes will avert driving bans which have already hit sales of diesel models.  Industry groups are deliberately pushing the worst-case scenario to safeguard their vested interests,  NordLB analyst Frank Schwope said. For every 2-3 jobs that will be lost from phasing out combustion engines, one new position will be created in R&D;, IT and other sectors related to zero-emission technology, Schwope said, dismissing Ifo's findings as incomprehensible. Environment Minister Barbara Hendricks told Tuesday's edition of German business daily Handelsblatt:  The auto industry has the responsibility that it will not come to this (driving bans).  She said the industry had to retrofit the affected cars as quickly as possible and must do so at its own cost. Ifo president Clemens Fuest dismissed criticism that Germany's car industry has been slow to embrace new technologies as it has focused on defending the combustion engine that has driven its prosperity.  That thesis doesn't stand up given efforts on innovation,  Fuest said, noting German carmakers own 40 percent of international patents on combustion engine cars and a quarter of patents on fuel cell cars. But Ferdinand Dudenhoeffer, head of the Center of Automotive Research at the University of Duisburg-Essen, said high spending on R&D; has mainly benefited combustion technology and carmakers had some catching up to do on battery research.  The VDA is getting its defences in position,  he said.  They're still keeping to combustion engines because it's hard to predict how electric car demand will pan out.

Benchmark zinc prices on the London Metal Exchange surged 60 percent last year after the shutdown of major mines around the world and suspensions at others raised the prospect of deep deficits. But at $2,769 a tonne, LME prices have only added 8 percent so far in 2017 and have failed to push above last year's peak of just under $3,000 a tonne. Bullish investors had expected shortages to develop in top consumer China, where physical market premiums in Shanghai surged to $195 a tonne in June, the highest since 2013, but they have since retreated to $175.  We think the second-half 2017 fundamental outlook for zinc looks less supportive, easing supply constraints and questionable demand strength,  JP Morgan analyst Natasha Kaneva wrote in a note. JP Morgan last week advised clients to take a short position in zinc, targeting a decline to $2,400.  Producer Selling Despite the closures of the huge Century mine in Australia and Lisheen in Ireland, together with mine suspensions from major producer Glencore, world zinc output rose 6.3 percent in the first five months of 2017, according to the International Zinc and Lead Study Group. [nL8N1K839F] Hedging by producers was probably partly behind a retreat in prices on Tuesday and more forward selling is likely, said Robin Bhar, head of metals research at Societe Generale. Major zinc producer Nyrstar announced on July 6 that it had put in place first-half 2018 hedging for 70 percent of the refined metal it will produce. [nGNE4hHx84]    There's always the danger that the market will be capped by producer selling and that hidden inventories will seep out, that's a perennial problem,  said Bhar, who forecast that third-quarter LME prices would average $2,520 a tonne. In addition to 368,569 tonnes of zinc stored in warehouses registered by the LME, the Shanghai Futures Exchange (ShFE) and the CME, analysts estimate there are up to 1.5 million tonnes of additional metal in other depots around the world. After declines in LME and ShFE inventories for most of the year, they have increased recently. Since last week, on-warrant LME stocks - those that are not earmarked for delivery and therefore available to investors - have nearly doubled and last week ShFE zinc stocks jumped 16.2 percent.   The unwinding of the current ShFE short squeeze should trigger large-scale profit taking and the release of zinc physical ingot inventories presently controlled by the longs,  Citi analysts said in a note.

Israeli newspaper Haaretz obtained a transcript of part of the talks Netanyahu held with Macron when they met for the first time in Paris on Sunday.  Told by Macron that France supports U.S. President Donald Trump's efforts to bring the Israelis and Palestinians back to negotiations, Netanyahu replied:    It will be difficult to push forward quickly with the American initiative. I’m not sure that Abu Mazen (Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas) can deliver on his commitments, for internal political reasons.  Israeli officials confirmed the gist of the transcript, which was in French, while French officials did not immediately comment. Netanyahu said Israel had every intention of working with the Americans but would prefer a different approach.  I’d like a parallel process with the Arab countries, at the same time as the process with the Palestinians,  he said, referring to the idea of forging a deal with Arab states along the lines of the Saudi peace initiative. The Saudi initiative, first put forward in 2002, would offer Israel recognition by the Arab world and the  normalization  of relations in exchange for a full withdrawal from the territory Israel has occupied since the 1967 Middle East war, including East Jerusalem.  French President Emmanuel Macron and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu react after making a joint declaration at the Elysee Palace in Paris, France, July 16, 2017.Stephane MaheNetanyahu has expressed tentative support for parts of the initiative, but there are many caveats on the Israeli side, including how to resolve the complex Palestinian refugee issue. The Palestinians are opposed to any Israeli attempt to cut them out of discussions, saying any peace with Arab states has to come via peace with the Palestinians first.  Abbas's spokesman, Nabil Abu Rdainah, said the Palestinians support Trump's peace efforts, adding:  What is needed is not to waste time.  Asked by Macron what he thought of the French initiative, proposed by former president Francois Hollande late in his term and based around an international peace conference, Netanyahu said:  I am against. It is not a good initiative.  The last round of peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians broke down in 2014. Trump has pledged to try to revive them, calling Middle East peace the  ultimate deal . He has received both Netanyahu and Abbas in the White House and visited the region in May. He appointed his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, as his chief negotiator, and a company lawyer, Jason Greenblatt, as the main go-between.  Palestinians want to establish an independent state in East Jerusalem, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, territories Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war.  In 2005, Israel pulled out of Gaza and the enclave is now governed by the Islamist Hamas movement. Israel continues to occupy the West Bank, where the Palestinians have limited self-rule, and East Jerusalem.

The pound jumped last month when various members of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee - including the governor himself - hinted that rates could rise in the coming months.  But the bank has also made clear that any monetary tightening will depend on data. That has taken some of the optimism away from sterling, particularly against the euro, and has led some strategists to say sterling is more sensitive to economic indicators than it has been for most of the past year, when Brexit has dominated price moves.  Others, however, say economic data are still less important than politics, and that it will be difficult for interest rates to be raised before there is more certainty over Britain's departure from the European Union.   Tuesday's numbers showed consumer prices rose by 2.6 percent in June compared with a year earlier, down from a nearly four-year high of 2.9 percent in May.  Our view on the BoE rate expectations hasn't changed following the data, and we are expecting a rate increase only by end-2018,  said Kamal Sharma, senior G10 FX strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in London.  Since the referendum, the correlation between the pound and the data has broken down, as it is driven more by Brexit headlines,  he added.

Its move began just before the data was released, re-igniting concern among financial traders that some market players see official economic data before the release time, despite restrictions on access to the numbers.

We have been arguing against a BoE rate hike for a while now, given that inflation has been driven mainly by cost-push factors rather than demand-led,  said Piotr Matys, a strategist at Rabobank in London.

Sixty percent of Peruvians polled said they would agree with a presidential pardon to release Fujimori from prison, but 54 percent would oppose it if he were not found to be sick enough to merit doing so for humanitarian reasons, according to the poll, which was published in the newspaper El Comercio. Kuczynski proposed a possible pardon for Fujimori last month as he struggled to reduce hostilities with Fujimori's supporters in the opposition-controlled Congress. He has said he would base his decision strictly on the recommendation of a team of doctors. Fujimori, 78, has spent the past decade serving a 25-year sentence for human rights crimes and corruption committed during his 1990-2000 government. His doctor has said Fujimori has undergone surgery several times for a recurrent growth on his tongue and recently experienced an abnormally fast heart beat. Kuczynski promised not to pardon Fujimori when he ran against Fujimori's daughter, Keiko Fujimori, in last year's tight election - helping him sweep up support from the family's foes. While pardoning Fujimori might help Kuczynski forge better ties with Congress, where Fujimori's supporters hold a majority of seats, it would anger the leftist groups that helped elect him and could define his legacy. Fujimori is now sharing a prison with his onetime opponent, former President Ollanta Humala, who is being held in pretrial detention in connection with money laundering allegations. Humala has denied the accusations. Humala rejected Fujimori's request for a humanitarian pardon in 2013 after a medical review found that Fujimori did not have a terminal illness. The Ipsos nationwide poll of 1,280 Peruvians was carried out between July 12 and 14 and had a 2.7-percentage-point margin of error, meaning results could vary by that much either way.

Republican senators' effort to pass their own healthcare overhaul bill collapsed late on Monday, stoking doubts over the likelihood that Trump's pro-growth agenda would come to fruition. Traders also remained doubtful the Federal Reserve would be able to raise interest rates again this year, while other central banks including the European Central Bank and Bank of England have signaled a more hawkish bent toward tightening policy.  The setback for Trump is a setback for the U.S. dollar,  said Kathy Lien, managing director at BK Asset Management in New York.  Based upon the failed repeal of Obamacare, I think that really casts doubt on the Trump administration's broader strategies.  The euro touched $1.1583 against the dollar, its strongest since early May 2016, with analysts noting traders who had  shorted  or bet against the euro were being forced to  cover  or repurchase the currency. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, touched its lowest since early September of 94.476. The dollar touched 0.9525 franc , its lowest against the Swiss currency since late June 2016, while the dollar hit a three-week low against the Japanese yen of 111.69 yen. The dollar index has fallen 7.5 percent since the start of the year, partly on the doubts over Trump's fiscal stimulus agenda, with much of the downdraft starting in early March. The Australian dollar was a beneficiary of the greenback's weakness on Tuesday and surged to a more than two-year high of $0.7942 .  This is a tremendous short squeeze in the euro on the break of $1.15, and that has resulted in a significant rally as shorts bail out of their positions,  said Douglas Borthwick, managing director at Chapdelaine Foreign Exchange in New York. Friday's weak reading on U.S. inflation and retail sales fanned speculation the Fed may not have justification for another rate hike by the end of this year, despite policymakers' projection for such a move.

(Reuters) - By the time Princeton University graduate student Xiyue Wang arrived in Iran to conduct research for his doctorate in history, he had already spent years living and working in politically turbulent countries. The Chinese-born U.S. citizen previously worked as a Pashto translator for the International Committee of the Red Cross in Afghanistan and spent time in Uzbekistan while a student at Harvard University. Wang, 37, was sentenced to 10 years in prison on spying charges after his arrest last summer, an Iranian official said on Sunday. He is the latest American citizen to face jail in Iran for what the U.S. State Department has denounced as fabricated charges. His sentencing shocked his colleagues at Princeton, who described him in interviews as a quiet but collegial scholar whose intellectual curiosity stood out even at the elite school in New Jersey. Wang is married and has a 4-year-old son. In addition to Pashto, English and his native Mandarin, Wang is also proficient in Russian and Turkish and was learning Persian in Iran. His wife, Hua Qu, said in a statement on Tuesday that her husband  has been unjustly imprisoned for espionage that I know he did not and never would commit.   We fervently hope that the Iranian authorities will release him soon so that he can return home to his young family,  she added. University President Chris Eisgruber said in a letter to the school on Monday that Princeton had kept his arrest confidential on the recommendation of advisers inside and outside of government. Wang, a history student at Princeton since 2013, was conducting field work for his dissertation, which is focused on how Muslim regions are governed. Princeton University graduate student Xiyue Wang is seen in this undated handout photo.  Family photo via Princeton University/via REUTERSIran accused him of scanning 4,500 pages of digital documents. His academic adviser, history Professor Stephen Kotkin, and fellow graduate students said in interviews that scanning historical documents – the ones Wang was studying were a century old, Kotkin said – for later review is a common practice for researchers. Kotkin said Wang was pursuing a  very ambitious  dissertation plan that included on-site research in Iran, Russia and potentially Afghanistan.  He's one of these kids who lives for research and ideas,  Kotkin said. Several history graduate students described Wang as a respected scholar but declined to go into detail, citing the sensitivity of the case. The history department's chairman, Keith Wailoo, emailed students on Monday asking them to refer news media inquiries to the school's communications office. One student and friend of Wang's, who requested anonymity after Wailoo's email, said Wang was  very driven  to succeed, working hard to learn Persian to read source material in its original form. An official at Iran's interests section in Washington, the country's de facto diplomatic outpost in the U.S. capital, declined to comment in detail on Wang's case, referring questions to Iran's United Nations mission, which did not respond to a request for comment. After high school in Beijing, Wang studied in China and India before moving to the United States, according to a lecture he gave years ago. He graduated from the University of Washington in 2006 and earned a master's degree at Harvard University, where he traveled to Uzbekistan and Tajikistan for research. In 2008-09, Wang worked at a law firm in Hong Kong through Princeton in Asia, a program that arranges fellowships in Asia for U.S. residents.  For better or worse, he still can't tell you what exactly he has been studying in the many years that have passed,  a biographical note on Princeton in Asia's website said.  What he does know is that his dream is to walk the ancient Silk Road from Xi'an to Rome one day.

A six-day trial in the State Court of Chatham County concluded late on Monday with the jury unanimously agreeing on the civil award to the family of Sarah Jones, court records show. Jones was killed when a moving train hit props and equipment staged on a railroad bridge and trestle south of Savannah for the never-completed film  Midnight Rider,  about Allman, who died in May. After the award, the film worker's parents, Richard and Elizabeth Jones, said they had spent more than three years trying to understand how their daughter lost her life.  That search has now come to a close,  they said in a statement. Railroad operator CSX Corp, which owns the tracks, is responsible for $3.9 million of the liability, court records show. The company said it will appeal the verdict.  CSX is deeply sympathetic to the terrible loss suffered by the family of Ms. Sarah Jones, but respectfully disagrees with the conclusions reached by the jury,  CSX spokesman Rob Doolittle said on Tuesday. Jacksonville, Florida-based CSX has maintained that the movie production company failed to secure permits to use the tracks for filming. Filmmaker Randall Miller previously settled with the family and spent about a year in jail after pleading guilty in 2015 to involuntary manslaughter and trespassing charges stemming from the crash, court records show. He was sentenced to two years in county jail and eight years probation as well as a $20,000 fine. All charges against Jody Savin, Miller's wife and business partner, were dropped. Jeff Harris, a lawyer for the Jones family, said the family had closure, but can never get their daughter back.  This has been cathartic for them,  Harris said, adding that the family has established a non-profit group,  Safety for Sarah,  dedicated to promoting safety on movie sets.

The central bank has printed an initial run of a billion of the new notes, which are known in Britain as  tenners , after last year's launch of a five pound note made from a polymer film that the BoE said is more durable and harder to forge. Tuesday marks the 200th anniversary of Austen's death. The writer was buried in Winchester Cathedral in 1817 and completed many of her best-known works such as  Pride and Prejudice  and  Emma  in the nearby village of Chawton.  Ten pounds would have meant a lot to Jane Austen, about the same as 1,000 pounds ($1,300) would mean to us today,  BoE Governor Mark Carney said at the launch of the new note in Winchester.  Austen received a 10 pound publisher's advance for her first novel and the new banknote bears a quotation  I declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading!  from her later work,  Pride and Prejudice .  The quotation came from a character who in fact had no interest in books and was merely trying to impress a potential suitor. It drew a mix of amusement and criticism in the media when it appeared on an initial design of the note in 2013. People in period costume pose with the new £10 note featuring Jane Austen, at Winchester Cathedral, in Winchester, Britain July 18, 2017.Chris J Ratcliffe/PoolCarney defended the choice on Tuesday.  It captures much of her spirit, at least in my mind,  he said.  It draws out some of the essence of some of her social satire and her insight into people's character. So it works on multiple levels.  Extinction Looms for Darwin Slideshow (2 Images)With tactile features to make it easier for blind people to identify, the BoE says each new 10 pound note should last for around five years, compared to around two years for the paper note it is replacing. Existing 10 pound notes, which feature the scientist Charles Darwin, will cease to be legal tender during the first half of next year. Rolling out the new plastic notes has not been without its problems. The five pound note released last year drew criticism from vegetarians and some religious groups for containing trace amounts of animal fats - something which will also be the case for the new 10 pound note.

Yields across the globe rose sharply after Trump won the U.S. election in November on promises for tax reforms and infrastructure investment that were expected to boost growth and inflation in the world's largest economy. Analysts called this the 'Trump trade'. However, for most of this year, yields have been grinding lower as investors tempered their initial expectations both for the speed at which Trump's plans can be implemented and the pace of monetary tightening by the U.S. central bank.  It is further evidence that not much will come from (Trump's) pro-growth policy that he pledged when he came to power. The market reaction is consistent but it is fairly small, suggesting a lot of this had already been priced in,  KBC strategist Piet Lammens said. The announcement on Monday that two Republican Senators would not support the latest version of the healthcare bill -- meaning it does not have enough votes to pass -- was yet another blow for Trump. U.S. 10-year bond yields and the dollar immediately fell after the news. German 10-year yields were down 2.5 basis points at 0.55 percent. They briefly touched an 18-month high on Tradeweb's trading platform, however this was down to an overnight change in the bond used as the benchmark. Weaker-than-expected inflation data in Britain sparked a tumble in British gilt yields, adding to downward pressure on yields in the euro area. Spain's 10-year yield fell as much as 7 basis points , closing the gap to German equivalents to levels not seen since September. Analysts said falls should be kept in check by upcoming supply which tends to put upward pressure on yields as investors sell outstanding bonds to make room in their portfolios for new debt. Europe's bailout fund -- the European Financial Stability Facility -- is set to sell a new 10-year bond and tap a 30-year bond on Tuesday, Thomson Reuters' IFR reported. There is also widespread speculation that Greece will end a three-year exile from markets this week and sell new debt. Greece is said to be looking at selling 2-4 billion euros of five-year bonds.

The Outlooks are Stable. Fitch has also affirmed ISV's dated subordinated notes and perpetual subordinated debt at 'BBB-' and 'BB+', respectively. KEY RATING DRIVERS ISV's IFS rating reflects its strong business profile in Italy, where it is the largest life insurance group by premiums, with EUR24 billion of gross premiums underwritten in 2016, and its good capitalisation. However, ISV is significantly exposed to Italian sovereign debt and this heavily influences its ratings. To match domestic liabilities, ISV held EUR51 billion of Italian sovereign bonds or around 10x consolidated shareholders' funds, including Fideuram Vita (FV), at end- 2016. ISV's large exposure to Italian sovereign debt constrains its IFS rating to Italy's sovereign IDR (BBB/Stable). If Italy was upgraded, it is unlikely that ISV's IDR would be higher than the IDR of its ultimate parent, Intesa Sanpaolo (ISP; BBB/Stable). ISV's Prism FBM score was 'Adequate' based on year-end 2015 results, and we expect it remained at least at this level in 2016. Its consolidated Solvency II ratio, calculated using the standard formula, was 190% at end-March 2017. However, given the large exposure to Italian sovereign debt, ISV could face a significant increase in regulatory capital charges if European authorities remove the zero risk-weighting for European sovereigns. Prism FBM already includes a capital charge for sovereign assets. ISV's Fitch-calculated financial leverage ratio (FLR) decreased to 23% in 2016 (2015: 24%). Fitch expects the FLR to remain commensurate with the company's rating in 2017. Fitch's total financing and commitments (TFC) ratio is low given the traditional nature of ISV's business. ISV's ultimate parent, ISP, is the second-largest Italian bank by total assets. ISV is highly integrated in ISP. The bank manages capital and risks at group level, including for ISV. As part of ISP's wealth management operations, ISV distributes its insurance products through ISP branches. Fitch views ISV as an important contributor to ISP's financial performance. ISV is rated on a standalone basis and its ratings do not benefit from ISP's ownership. Life gross written premiums, including FV, fell by 13% yoy at end-2016 to EUR24 billion, after ISV suspended sales of life traditional savings products in favour of unit-linked and hybrid products. This volatile trend is also linked to the volatile nature of the bancassurance business in Italy. Net income increased to EUR691 million in 2016 (2015: EUR659 million). ISV's 2012-2016 average return on equity was strong at 11%. Fitch expects ISV's net profitability will continue to support the ratings in 2017. Fitch considers ISV's exposure to interest rate risk as low. This reflects strong asset and liability matching and relatively low minimum guarantees. The reduction in minimum guarantees offered on new business (0% for the newest products), is reducing the proportion of in-force life reserves that carry financial guarantees. New guarantees apply only at maturity, rather than accruing year by year, allowing ISV greater flexibility in dealing with low investment returns in any particular year.

The central bank has printed an initial run of a billion of the new notes, which are known in Britain as  tenners , after last year's launch of a five pound note made from a polymer film that the BoE said is more durable and harder to forge. Tuesday marks the 200th anniversary of Austen's death. The writer was buried in Winchester Cathedral in 1817 and completed many of her best-known works such as  Pride and Prejudice  and  Emma  in the nearby village of Chawton.  Ten pounds would have meant a lot to Jane Austen, about the same as 1,000 pounds ($1,300) would mean to us today,  BoE Governor Mark Carney said at the launch of the new note in Winchester.  Austen received a 10 pound publisher's advance for her first novel and the new banknote bears a quotation  I declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading!  from her later work,  Pride and Prejudice .  The quotation came from a character who in fact had no interest in books and was merely trying to impress a potential suitor. It drew a mix of amusement and criticism in the media when it appeared on an initial design of the note in 2013.

It captures much of her spirit, at least in my mind,  he said.  It draws out some of the essence of some of her social satire and her insight into people's character. So it works on multiple levels.  Extinction Looms for Darwin Slideshow (2 Images)With tactile features to make it easier for blind people to identify, the BoE says each new 10 pound note should last for around five years, compared to around two years for the paper note it is replacing. Existing 10 pound notes, which feature the scientist Charles Darwin, will cease to be legal tender during the first half of next year. Rolling out the new plastic notes has not been without its problems. The five pound note released last year drew criticism from vegetarians and some religious groups for containing trace amounts of animal fats - something which will also be the case for the new 10 pound note. The BoE is working to find an alternative production method in time for when it launches a new 20 pound note in 2020.

Stocks were lower with South Africa's largest technology group EOH Holdings falling 9 percent after allegations of corruption surfaced. The firm denies wrongdoing. By 1500 GMT the rand had gained 0.2 percent to 12.9300 compared to its close of 12.9550 overnight in New York. The local unit burst through the 13.00 psychological mark on Monday on its way to a two-week best as last week's decision by government to suspend new mining laws combined with weak U.S. economic data soothed investor anxieties. High-yield but riskier assets were buoyed on the day by the dollar's continued slide following weaker-than-expected housing data and the collapse of a health bill. The rand has gained more than 5 percent since last Tuesday and is seen by some by analysts breaking through technical resistance around 12.92 if consumer inflation data on Wednesday keeps trending lower.  The CPI data on Wednesday will really give clues on the direction of the trend, and it's unlikely to surprise in either direction,  said interest rates specialist at Rand Merchant Bank André Eerenstein. Eerenstein said the chances of a rate cut by the central bank on Thursday were higher than the previous policy meeting, with markets pricing in between 30 to 40 percent probability of a cut. On the bourse, the benchmark Top-40 index fell 1.2 percent to 46,927 points while the All-Share index weakened 1.05 percent to 53,261 points. EOH was the biggest faller on the Johannesburg All-Share index, dropping 8.81 percent to 115.80 rand a share, after an opinion piece in Business Report newspaper accused the company of being involved in impropriety in its contracts with South Africa's welfare agency.

The collapse of his fellow Republicans' push to repeal and replace Obamacare with their own healthcare bill in the U.S. Senate again raised doubts in financial markets about Trump's ability to enact tax cuts and infrastructure spending. The dollar fell 0.6 percent against a basket of key currencies, setting a 10-month low and extending its 2017 decline to more than 7 percent.  It pushes out the rest of the agenda. It’s hard to do a tax reform in the style that it was campaigned on,  said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities in New York.  The healthcare hurdle pushes everything in Trump’s agenda to 2018.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 94.98 points, or 0.44 percent, to 21,534.74, the S&P; 500 lost 2.55 points, or 0.10 percent, to 2,456.59. The Nasdaq Composite added 7.12 points, or 0.11 percent, to 6,321.55. Netflix shares soared after the streaming television company's strong customer growth, boosting the Nasdaq. Shares of Goldman Sachs and Bank of America fell after those banks' respective quarterly reports, and weighed on bank indexes in the United States and Europe . Harley-Davidson shares tumbled after the motorcycle maker's weak forecast. In Europe, the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index lost 1.09 percent. Sweden's Ericsson tumbled after a worse-than-expected second-quarter loss. MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.05 percent after touching an all-time high on Monday. In currencies, the euro was up 0.84 percent to $1.1574 against the dollar. Aside from the Trump agenda setback, there are increasing doubts about further near-term rate hikes by the Federal Reserve.  The setback for Trump is a setback for the U.S. dollar,  said Kathy Lien, managing director at BK Asset Management in New York.  I think that really casts doubt on the Trump administration's broader strategies.  Expectations for the Fed hiking interest rates this year have been pushed back to the fourth quarter, the latest Reuters poll of economists showed. A poll conducted last month predicted the Fed would raise rates by September.  Clearly, anything that comes along at the moment just corroborates the market's negative attitude on the dollar,  said Neil Mellor, senior FX strategist with Bank of New York Mellon in London.  There's just not enough inflation at the moment. And anything like this (defeat for Trump) is liable to push it lower.  U.S. Treasury yields fell after the latest political drama in Washington, while more data pointed to benign inflation with a drop in import prices for a second straight month. Benchmark 10-year notes last rose 12/32 in price to yield 2.2678 percent, from 2.309 percent late on Monday. Yields across the globe rose sharply after Trump won the U.S. election in November on promises for tax reforms and infrastructure investment that were expected to boost growth and inflation in the world's largest economy. Oil prices rose as demand soaked up some of the surplus supplies from OPEC and the United States. U.S. crude rose 0.54 percent to $46.27 per barrel and Brent was last at $48.74, up 0.66 percent on the day. Copper rose 0.18 percent to $6,006.50 a tonne. Spot gold added 0.7 percent to $1,241.96 an ounce.

A weekend of anonymous briefings by members of the prime minister's top team of cabinet ministers against her chancellor, Philip Hammond, shows the level of panic in the party after it lost its majority at last month's election, two Conservative sources said. Austerity, sold to voters as the need for Britain to  live within its means , has been the hallmark of the Conservative government since it took power under David Cameron in 2010.  But, desperate to win back voters lost during an ill-judged election campaign led by May, some ministers want Hammond to loosen the budget reins and give hospital staff, firefighters  and police officers a pay rise. The proposal risks worsening divisions in the party just as Britain starts the fraught business of negotiating Brexit. Hammond, returning to the political front line after being sidelined for months by May, remains committed to bringing down the deficit - frustrating colleagues who fear that generous spending pledges by the opposition Labour Party are winning over voters.  There are millions of public sector workers and we need their votes,  a senior Conservative Party source said.  Everybody is bored with austerity.  The Conservative Party, once called the nasty party by May for its  petty feuding and personal sniping , risks looking out of touch, the source said, especially after three Islamic militant attacks and a devastating fire at an apartment block have stretched Britain's police and firefighters.  Everyone's thinking about the next election that's why the pay cap (limiting increases in public sector salaries) has come into play, and they are talking more to their electorate,  the source said. May, whose authority is in tatters after the June poll, has all but lost control of her ministers.  Hammond has made a comeback after being left in the cold during the election campaign and weakened by what a senior Conservative described as a  toxic  relationship with the prime minister's former top aides. His push for a Brexit that puts business and jobs first, rather than curbing immigration, has not gone down well with eurosceptics in the party, the sources and one Conservative lawmaker said.  Overpaid  May, 60, called for her team to show the  strength and unity  Britain needs, and to keep discussions private after unnamed ministers said Hammond told the cabinet that public sector workers were overpaid. The hostile briefing was aimed at undermining Hammond for his uncompromising stance on public sector pay, the source said. Hammond did not deny the comment and told the BBC on Sunday that public sector workers received about 10 percent more than those in the private sector when  very generous  pension contributions from their employers were taken into account. Pay rises for more than 5 million public sector workers are set by independent pay review bodies, which consider evidence from the government, employers and unions. But the pay cap, introduced in 2013, has limited any increase to one percent. Removing it would mean that every one percent increase in pay would add about one billion pounds to the government's 106 billion pound ($138 billion) wage bill, according to Reuters calculations. That would make it even harder for Hammond to meet his target of balancing the budget by the mid-2020s. With signs growing that Britain's economy is struggling for momentum, the outlook for the public finances has clouded over. Households are strained by rising prices, fueled by the pound's sharp fall after last year's Brexit vote, which is likely to limit tax revenues in the months ahead. With the police, teachers, firefighters and nurses calling for the cap to be removed, the government has said it would respond to recommendations on pay increases as they are made. But a source close to May said there would have to be pay increases if Britain wanted to be able to recruit workers after Brexit, when there will be fewer migrant workers from the European Union.  There will be movement on the pay cap because Brexit means there'll be hiring issues,  the source said.

Import price pressures are, however, likely to pick up given the recent weakness in the dollar, which has declined 6.1 percent in value against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners this year.   The focus should be on the dollar,  said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.  If a stronger dollar represented tighter financial conditions and a disinflationary impulse, a weaker dollar implies looser conditions and an inflationary impulse. The Labor Department said on Tuesday that import prices decreased 0.2 percent last month after falling 0.1 percent in May. In the 12 months through June, import prices increased 1.5 percent. That was the smallest gain since last November and followed May's 2.3 percent increase.  The year-on-year increase in import prices has slowed sharply since posting 4.7 percent in February, which was the biggest advance in five years.  Import prices excluding petroleum edged up 0.1 percent after being unchanged the prior month. They have stabilized since falling last October, reflecting the dollar's depreciation, and increased 1.4 percent in the 12 months through June. The report followed data last week showing consumer prices unchanged in June and the annual CPI rate increasing 1.6 percent - the smallest rise since October 2016.  The dollar has been hurt by the benign inflation outlook and diminishing expectations of a fiscal stimulus from Washington after Republicans in the U.S. Congress struggled with healthcare reform. Political scandals surrounding President Donald Trump are also seen impeding his pro-growth agenda. The dollar fell to a 10-month low against a basket of currencies on Tuesday, while prices for U.S. government bonds rose. Stocks on Wall Street were trading down. Temporary Factors Low oil prices are largely curbing both domestic and imported inflation pressures. Other factors such as declining prices for mobile phone services have also contributed to pushing inflation below the Federal Reserve's 2 percent target. Fed Chair Janet Yellen told lawmakers last week that the recent ebb in inflation was partly the result of  a few unusual reductions in certain categories of prices  that would eventually drop out of the calculation.  Expectations for a weakening U.S. dollar should pressure nonfuel import prices higher, supportive to the Fed's projection that inflation will gradually climb in the second half of the year,  said Sam Bullard, a senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. Persistently low inflation will likely have an impact on the timing of a third interest rate increase this year from the U.S. central bank, which most economists expect would be in December. Last month, prices for imported petroleum fell 2.2 percent after decreasing 1.2 percent in May. Imported petroleum prices have not risen since gaining 0.8 percent in February. Prices for imported capital goods rose 0.2 percent, the largest increase since May 2014, while motor vehicle prices fell 0.2 percent. The cost of imported food increased 0.9 percent.  The report also showed export prices dropped 0.2 percent in June as falling vegetable, soybeans and fruit prices weighed on  agricultural exports, after falling 0.5 percent in May.

The Milwaukee-based motorcycle maker also said it would need to cut production in second half of 2017, resulting in hourly workforce reductions at some of its U.S. plants. Harley's shares were down 9 percent at $47.17 in late morning trading on Tuesday. While demand for new models has waned, the company has also taken a hit from used motorcycles being sold off by aging customers. For the full year, Harley said it expects to ship 241,000 to 246,000 motorcycles, compared with 262,221 a year earlier. The company had previously forecast shipments to be flat to modestly down. That's a far cry from the nearly 350,000 it shipped a year about a decade ago.  We are downgrading Harley-Davidson to 'market-perform' based on increased conviction that motorcycle demand in the United States is in the throes of secular erosion,  Bernstein analyst David Beckel said. Beckel noted that the  Generation Y  - those born in the 1980s and early 1990s - was adopting motorcycling at a far lower rate than prior generations. Like other companies in the manufacturing industry, Harley was widely expected to benefit from President Donald Trump's proposals to boost infrastructure spending and cut taxes. A Harley-Davidson bike is displayed in their office in Singapore October 13, 2016.Edgar Su/File Photo The hoped-for drivers of incremental Trump-related demand – infrastructure spending, middle class tax cuts, corporate tax cuts, domestic production advantages – are all on hold, perhaps indefinitely,  Bernstein analyst David Beckel said. Harley is also up against aggressive discounting by rivals such as Polaris Industries Inc (PII.N), the maker of the Indian bike, and Japan's Honda Motor Co Ltd (7267.T). The company said it expected to ship 39,000 to 44,000 motorcycles in the current quarter, suggesting a decline of up to 20 percent. Retail motorcycle sales fell 9.3 percent in the United States, its biggest market, and 6.7 percent globally in the second quarter ended June 25. Harley said its share in the U.S. big-bike market fell to 48.5 percent from 49.5 percent a year earlier. The company now expects 2017 operating margin to be down about 1 percentage point. It had previously forecast operating margin to be in line with 2016. Net income fell 7.7 percent to $258.9 million, or $1.48 per share. Revenue per motorcycle rose about $437 to $15,530 in the quarter, but revenue from motorcycles and related products fell about 5.6 percent to $1.58 billion.

Trump,Janet Yellen,John Ryding,Sam Bullard,US,USA,ECONOMY,INFLATION,International Trade,Inflation,Economic Indicators,Central Banks / Central Bank Events,Economic Events,English,Graphics,US Government News,Reports,Economic News (3rd Party),United States","sector":"Markets","content":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. import prices fell for a second straight month in June amid further declines in the cost of petroleum products, suggesting inflation could remain benign in the near term. Import price pressures are, however, likely to pick up given the recent weakness in the dollar, which has declined 6.1 percent in value against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners this year.   The focus should be on the dollar,  said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.  If a stronger dollar represented tighter financial conditions and a disinflationary impulse, a weaker dollar implies looser conditions and an inflationary impulse. The Labor Department said on Tuesday that import prices decreased 0.2 percent last month after falling 0.1 percent in May. In the 12 months through June, import prices increased 1.5 percent. That was the smallest gain since last November and followed May's 2.3 percent increase.  The year-on-year increase in import prices has slowed sharply since posting 4.7 percent in February, which was the biggest advance in five years.  Import prices excluding petroleum edged up 0.1 percent after being unchanged the prior month. They have stabilized since falling last October, reflecting the dollar's depreciation, and increased 1.4 percent in the 12 months through June. The report followed data last week showing consumer prices unchanged in June and the annual CPI rate increasing 1.6 percent - the smallest rise since October 2016.  The dollar has been hurt by the benign inflation outlook and diminishing expectations of a fiscal stimulus from Washington after Republicans in the U.S. Congress struggled with healthcare reform. Political scandals surrounding President Donald Trump are also seen impeding his pro-growth agenda. The dollar fell to a 10-month low against a basket of currencies on Tuesday, while prices for U.S. government bonds rose. Stocks on Wall Street were trading down. Temporary Factors Low oil prices are largely curbing both domestic and imported inflation pressures. Other factors such as declining prices for mobile phone services have also contributed to pushing inflation below the Federal Reserve's 2 percent target. Fed Chair Janet Yellen told lawmakers last week that the recent ebb in inflation was partly the result of  a few unusual reductions in certain categories of prices  that would eventually drop out of the calculation.  Expectations for a weakening U.S. dollar should pressure nonfuel import prices higher, supportive to the Fed's projection that inflation will gradually climb in the second half of the year,  said Sam Bullard, a senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. Persistently low inflation will likely have an impact on the timing of a third interest rate increase this year from the U.S. central bank, which most economists expect would be in December. Last month, prices for imported petroleum fell 2.2 percent after decreasing 1.2 percent in May. Imported petroleum prices have not risen since gaining 0.8 percent in February. Prices for imported capital goods rose 0.2 percent, the largest increase since May 2014, while motor vehicle prices fell 0.2 percent. The cost of imported food increased 0.9 percent.  The report also showed export prices dropped 0.2 percent in June as falling vegetable, soybeans and fruit prices weighed on  agricultural exports, after falling 0.5 percent in May.  They rose 0.6 percent year-on-year, the smallest gain since prices started rising in December, curbed by lower export prices for soybeans, fruit and corn.

The central bank shored up the Skye last year with a 100 billion naira ($328 million) capital injection, after sacking its top management for failing to meet minimum capital requirements. It then appointed a new management team. The bank said it had recovered 60 billion naira in bad loans, closed some branches and sold four subsidiaries to boost capital in the past year. Skye's problems started after it used short-term funds to buy local lender Mainstreet Bank in 2014 but failed to raise fresh cash. It was in talks with shareholders and investors last year to raise 30 billion naira but suspended the plans when weak oil prices hit capital markets and drove foreign investors away.  The bank continues to require assistance from central bank and government as it repairs the damage inflicted on the institution in the past and charts a sustainable path forward for the bank,  Skye bank said in a statement. It said it had reached restructuring agreements with many of the chronic bad debtors resulting in improved payments and prospects of future recoveries, it said in a statement. Skye shares rose more than 3 percent on Tuesday and were up 16 percent this year, after last year's 68 percent plunge. The bank, which posted a pre-tax loss in 2015, said it had submitted its 2016 accounts for approval. The central bank designated Skye as one of Nigeria's systemically important banks due to the size of total deposits it holds after it acquired Mainstreet Bank. This means it has to increase its capital ratio to 16 percent, the industry average. The bank said it has appointed advisers to guide it on a recapitalisation process and that it has identified various options with proposals being considered by the central bank. $1 = 304.90 naira Editing by Mark Potter and Edmund Blair","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/nigeria-skye-bank-idUSL5N1K94XZ"},

Spieth has come the closest to any player of repeating the kind of dominance that Woods enjoyed, producing a magnificent 2015 season when he captured the U.S. Masters and U.S. Open titles and came close to winning the Open and U.S. PGA Championship. But the 23-year-old American was unable to maintain that extraordinary level of performance in 2016 and says those hoping for a new king of golf may be waiting in vain.  I wouldn't get your hopes up. What Tiger's done, I just -- having experienced a year like he continued to do for years. It just takes a lot out of you. It's very tough to do,  he told reporters.  What I'm saying is, I doubt you'll see a dominance like that maybe ever again in the game. I just think guys are learning, guys are getting stronger.   Guys are winning younger, playing more fearless, even in major championships, and I just think that it's so difficult now.  I wouldn't get your hopes up for a domination like that whatsoever,  he added. However, the Texan believes that the sport will still provide plenty of drama even without an undisputed number one.  I think it's going to be a very exciting time. You'll see a group of 10-to-12 guys over the next 15, 20 years that are going to have a lot of different competitions that come down the stretch with each other.   It's different than one person being the guy to beat. But I think it's exciting, exciting for us as players. You just never know, and if you play well, you're going to have a chance with these other guys who are equally as capable,  he said.Spieth will probably always be judged against his remarkable break-out year and he said that his current form was not far off that level - even if he now acknowledges there won't be many years like 2015. I haven't been making as many putts as I did that year this year,  he said.  I've struck the ball better than I did in '15. I've actually been in better positions. If you took hole by hole, I've been in a better position tee to green than I was that year.   If I putted the same as '15 I'd be having a better year right now. It's hard to do. So, certain parts of the game I think I've improved on. And others ... it's just fluctuated. And that's how it will go. It will go like this,  he said.  I recognize that, being five years in now, and five years doesn't make me a veteran but it helps me realize ... how things go.   Last year I was pretty caught in 2015, and this year I'm not. This year I recognize that that kind of year, hopefully, we can have another one or two like that.   But if we keep on trying to improve each part of the game, stick to the process, then we'll have the results that we want.

Russian Federal Security Service agents captured the Arctic Sunrise in international waters after a protest against an oil platform. Those on board were detained in Russian prisons for months and released shortly before the Sochi Olympics. The five-member arbitration panel, based in Vienna, ruled in 2015 that Russia was liable under the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and has now put a price on damages to the ship, as well as the wrongful arrest and suffering of 30 people aboard.  This decision makes clear that ships in international waters cannot be forcibly boarded and those aboard arrested at a whim,  Dutch Foreign Minister Bert Koenders said in a statement. Russia declined to take part in arbitration, arguing that it was acting within its sovereign rights to seize the ship in an area of international waters where Russia enjoys exclusive economic rights. Activists had earlier tried to scale the Prirazlomnaya drilling platform, operated by Gazprom. The arbitration panel found it had jurisdiction under UNCLOS, which Russia is party to and which empowers it to resolve such disputes. Moscow was not immediately available for comment. Russia's state-operated RIA Novosti news agency reported that Moscow would review the decision but cited unnamed sources at the Foreign Ministry saying it still rejected the tribunal's jurisdiction. Greepeace said the panel's rulings  resoundingly reaffirm the right to peaceful protest at sea.  It acknowledged that it is unclear whether Russia would comply with the ruling and pay damages. Any funds Russia pays will be forwarded to Greenpeace International by the Dutch government, the environmental group said. They will go to ship repairs and as compensation for the 30 arrestees.

In a letter published on the Financial Times website on Tuesday, the group said the vote to leave the European Union had already caused much damage to Britain's international standing and prompted some EU citizens living here to leave.  Even before the UK has left the EU, we face falling living standards, rising inflation, slowing growth and lower productivity,  said the letter, whose signatories include John Kerr, a former diplomat who devised the Article 50 of the EU's Lisbon Treaty which allows Britain to leave the bloc.  We call for a national debate on Brexit. We ask our fellow citizens, and our politicians, to think again. It is time to call a halt to Brexit,  the letter said. Among the dozens of signatories were historian Tom Devine, poet Christine De Luca, academics, lawyers and former politicians, though they did not include the heads of any major businesses or prominent current politicians. Britons voted by 52 percent to 48 percent to leave the EU in a June 23, 2016 referendum that exposed deep regional and social divisions. While voters in England and Wales backed 'Leave', a majority in Scotland and Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU, adding to strains between the constituent nations of the U.K. British Prime Minister Theresa May, a supporter of EU  membership who won power in the turmoil following the shock referendum result, has vowed to implement Brexit, though her strategy is the subject of public debate by her own ministers. While both May's Conservatives and the opposition Labour Party now explicitly support leaving the club the United Kingdom joined in 1973, some of the Union's most powerful politicians have raised the possibility of Britain cancelling Brexit. Former prime minister Tony Blair suggested on Saturday that Britain could end up staying in the EU because public opinion could change. Brexiteers fear a sharp economic contraction could prompt calls for a second referendum, though they have warned such a step would prompt a major constitutional crisis. In their letter the opponents of Brexit said it would be much less damaging to reverse course than to press ahead with the complex and divisive divorce negotiations. Britain is currently scheduled to leave the EU in March 2019.  In a democracy, it is always possible to think again and to choose a different direction,  they said.

Sudan's economy has deteriorated since the south seceded in 2011, taking with it three-quarters of the country's oil output, its main source of foreign currency and government income. The government cut fuel and electricity subsidies in November in a bid to tighten its finances and petrol prices rose by about 30 percent, leading to broader inflation. Before the June figures, year-on-year inflation had climbed every month since March 2016, when it stood at 12.94 percent. A dollar shortage and a ballooning black market for hard currency have also made foreign-made goods more expensive in a heavily import-dependent country.

The proceeds will be used to partly finance the USD7.2 billion acquisition of Patheon N.V. The Rating Outlook is Stable. Thermo Fisher plans to finance the acquisition with $2 billion of equity and approximately $5.2 billion of unsecured notes and short-term debt. Free cash flow generation will help to reduce near-term debt maturities through 2018. The company anticipates suspending share repurchases until debt reduction results in gross leverage of 3.0x. KEY RATING DRIVERS Fitch calculates pro forma gross leverage of around 4.3x following the acquisitions of Patheon N.V. The acquisition follows close on the heels of the acquisition of FEI Company in 4Q16 for $4.2 billion; however, Fitch expects gross leverage to return to roughly 3x by the end of 2018, a level that is consistent with the 'BBB' rating. Flexibility at Thermo Fisher's current 'BBB' rating is limited until its de-levering plan is complete. This should be achievable if near-term targets are bolt-on acquisitions that augment the company's product portfolio. Larger transactions during this timeframe would likely require a component of equity financing to maintain the current rating. Fitch views aggressive capital deployment, rather than operating risk, as Thermo Fisher's key credit risk. Capital deployments for acquisitions and shareholder payments have historically contributed to higher debt levels and deterioration of credit metrics, reducing financial flexibility in the aftermath of leveraging transactions. However, Thermo Fisher has consistently demonstrated a commitment and ability to repair the balance sheet by paying down large amounts of debt following transactions. Thermo Fisher's diversification across customer markets and product categories helps to mitigate the impact of cyclical downturns or secular headwinds to sales or profitability in any one of the company's end markets. The addition of Patheon, an outsourced provider of contract manufacturing for biopharmaceutical companies, presents cross-selling opportunities in Thermo Fisher's fastest growing customer end market. In addition, the outsourced contract manufacturing space is currently highly fragmented, and Fitch believes Thermo Fisher's significant brand presence and broad product and service offerings will prove to be a competitive advantage versus smaller CMO players. Thermo Fisher's ample FCF, which Fitch forecasts to exceed USD2.8 billion in 2017, should be sufficient to repay debt issued to finance the Patheon acquisition, as well as to fund share repurchases and dividends of around USD1 billion in 2017. DERIVATION SUMMARY Thermo Fisher is well-positioned relative to peers on each major comparative, with top positions in the majority of its portfolio. Thermo Fisher's operating profile is supportive of an investment-grade credit profile. The company manufactures and sells a diversified portfolio of life sciences products with a favorable end-market sales mix that somewhat insulates Thermo Fisher from weak demand in any one segment. The greatest threat to Thermo Fisher's credit profile is its aggressive capital management strategy. Acquisitions and shareholder payments have occasionally contributed to higher debt levels and deterioration of credit metrics, reducing financial flexibility in the aftermath of leveraging transactions. Thermo Fisher is well-positioned operationally compared to other healthcare companies in the life sciences and diagnostics sub-sectors, which are generally rated in the low- to mid- 'BBB' category. Thermo Fisher's operating profile is favorably differentiated by the breadth and depth of the company's portfolio of product and service offerings, and diversification of end-market customers versus peer companies PerkinElmer, Inc. ('BBB'/Stable), Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc. ('BBB-'/Stable) and Agilent Technologies, Inc. ('BBB+'/Stable). Thermo Fisher also exhibits operating margins and coverage metrics that are in-line with or better than its peers. Thermo Fisher's leverage tends to be higher than peers due to a relatively more aggressive stance towards capital deployment for M&A; and shareholder returns. The company is nevertheless similarly rated, since the strength of the operating profile reduces cyclicality of results due to sensitivity of demand in any one geographic or customer end market. The company has also demonstrated a willingness to reduce debt in the aftermath of leveraging transactions and an ability to efficiently integrate large acquisitions. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: --The Patheon acquisition closes in late 2017 and is financed as currently proposed by the company: $2 billion equity and about $5 billion debt. --Thermo Fisher's gross debt leverage drops to 3.0x by year-end 2018, benefitting from debt repayment and EBITDA growth; Fitch does not assume the realization of revenue or cost synergies from the Patheon or FEI integrations to be a major driver of EBITDA growth over the forecast period. --Revenue growth of 3%-4% over the forecast period. This reflects Fitch's general expectations for growth in the life sciences sector. Persistent headwinds in developed industrial markets will be offset by stronger growth in emerging markets and biopharmaceutical end markets. --The operating EBITDA margin is slightly lower in 2018 from integrating the lower margin Patheon business. --Cash from operations is more than sufficient to fund a slightly increasing dividend, bolt-on acquisitions and resumed share repurchases over the next three years. --Annual FCF of $2.8 billion in 2017 and above $3 billion in the outer years of the forecasts, providing more than enough FCF to reduce debt to the 3.0x level consistent with the 'BBB' rating within 18-24 months post-close of the Patheon acquisition. RATING SENSITIVITIES Thermo Fisher's favorable business profile, with significant scale, good end-market diversification and improved product mix following the Life Tech acquisition all support the ratings. Therefore, rating actions are more likely to be triggered by capital deployment decisions than by an operational stress scenario. Maintenance of the 'BBB' Issuer Default Rating (IDR) considers Fitch's continued expectation that Thermo Fisher will be an active acquirer going forward while maintaining run-rate gross debt/EBITDA of between 2.8x-3.2x in most periods. Fitch recognizes that gross leverage may occasionally exceed this range in the immediate aftermath of leveraging transactions. If Thermo Fisher were to complete a leveraging transaction that cast doubt on its ability to return leverage to roughly 3x within the following 18-24 months, it could result in a downgrade. A near-term positive rating action is not anticipated, since it would require a commitment from the company to maintain leverage below 2.5x. LIQUIDITY Thermo Fisher's solid financial flexibility and strong liquidity is an important factor supporting the investment-grade credit profile. At March 31, 2017, the company's sources of liquidity included USD713 million of cash on hand and USD2.4 billion of capacity under its USD2.5 billion revolving credit facility (RCF). The RCF is back-up for the CP program and if the revolver is drawn the company intends to leave an available balance at least equal to the amount of CP outstanding. The debt maturity schedule of the company's senior notes is laddered. FULL LIST OF RATINGS Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc. --Long-Term IDR 'BBB'; --Senior notes 'BBB'; --Bank revolving credit facility 'BBB'; --Short-term IDR 'F2'; --Commercial Paper 'F2'. Life Technologies Corp. --Long-Term IDR 'BBB'; --Senior notes 'BBB'. Thermo Fisher Scientific (Finance I) B.V. --Senior notes 'BBB'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.

Losses on the Nasdaq were limited by a 12 percent jump in Netflix to a record high, following the video streaming company's robust subscriber growth. Shares of Bank of America slipped 1.6 percent weighing on the S&P;, while Goldman Sachs' 2.6 percent fall dragged the Dow. Last week, shares of JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Citigroup had taken a beating after their quarterly results and forecasts failed to excite investors. The S&P; healthcare sector was under pressure, falling 0.52 percent, after the healthcare bill to replace Obamacare sank in the Senate, as Republicans remained divided on how to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. The failure of the bill spelled uncertainty for President Donald Trump's agenda of tax reform and an infrastructure overhaul, leaving the president without any major legislative accomplishments six months into his tenure.  The healthcare bill not coming through raises some continued concerns about the ability of Washington to push through favorable fiscal policies,  said Lisa Kopp, head of traditional investments at U.S. Bank Wealth Management. News about the bill's collapse sent the U.S. dollar to a 10-month low against a basket of major currencies. UnitedHealth Group fell 0.8 percent and along with Goldman Sachs, shaved off 51 points from the Dow. At 11:04 a.m. ET (1504 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 98.46 points, or 0.46 percent, at 21,531.26, the S&P; 500 was down 3.54 points, or 0.14 percent, at 2,455.60. The Nasdaq Composite was up 4.29 points, or 0.07 percent, at 6,318.72. Seven of the 11 major S&P; 500 sectors were lower, with the financial index's 0.61 percent fall leading the decliners. The market will be keeping a close eye on corporate results to see if the high valuations are justified in the face of mixed economic data, tepid inflation and policy gridlock in Washington.  With valuation where they are, it is really important for earnings to come through for the market to retain their momentum and push upwards,  said Kopp. Analysts are estimating an 8.2 percent rise in second-quarter earnings for the S&P; 500 companies from a year earlier. This follows a robust first quarter when U.S. companies posted their best earnings since 2011, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

UnitedHealth was losing money selling these plans when it pulled out of this market, as it and other insurers questioned the sustainability of former President Barack Obama's health reform law.  Republicans have vowed repeatedly to repeal and replace the law, but have disagreed on how to do that. A Senate effort collapsed late on Monday, prompting U.S. President Donald Trump to again call for a repeal of Obamacare with no replacement. UnitedHealth CEO Stephen Hemsley said during a call with Wall Street analysts on Tuesday that he was optimistic about the business next year, but that national and state healthcare policy were a possible drag on profit in 2018.  Related CoverageUnitedHealth CEO says national healthcare policy a risk for 2018UnitedHealth says health insurance tax raises costs At this stage in the national conversation, speculation about any outcome here would be just that,  Hemsley said. The bill's failure removed one of the benefits of the bill for insurers - the planned repeal of an industry wide health insurance tax, Leerink Partners analyst Ana Gupte said. UnitedHealth shares fell 0.7 percent to $184.97 in midday trading. Other insurers like Aetna Inc (AET.N), Anthem Inc (ANTM.N), Cigna Corp (CI.N) and Humana Inc (HUM.N) were also down on the news.       They had traded up a little on this expectation that the tax would go away next year,  Gupte said.  I think investors are saying nothing is happening for a while.   Insurers typically raise prices on health plans to pass the 3-percent premium tax onto the insured but that part of Obamacare was put on hiatus last year after both Democrats and Republicans voted to do so. It would have been permanently repealed in the failed Republican bill. UnitedHealth called on Tuesday for the permanent repeal of the health insurance tax, saying it hurts consumers. Earnings Rise UnitedHealth, which sells employer-based insurance as well as for the government programs Medicare for the elderly and Medicaid for the poor, said net earnings rose to $2.28 billion, or $2.32 per share, in the second quarter ended June 30, from $1.75 billion, or $1.81 per share, a year earlier.  Excluding items, UnitedHealth earned $2.46 per share, beating average estimate of $2.38, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Total revenue rose 7.7 percent to $50.05 billion, largely in line with estimates. The insurer said its withdrawal from Obamacare individual markets, combined with the health insurance tax deferral, reduced second-quarter revenue by about $1.8 billion and lowered revenue growth rate by 4.5 percent.

Claimants with 94.1 percent of the principal amount cast votes, the state-run bank said in a statement on Tuesday. Two-thirds support was needed for the plan to be adopted. IBA creditors include domestic sovereign wealth fund SOFAZ, commodities trader Cargill, Italian lender Intesa Sanpaolo , Germany's Commerzbank and Bayerische Landesbank and France's Societe Generale. Several big asset managers are holders of its Eurobond. IBA infuriated investors when it first unveiled the restructuring in May but, after modifying terms, offered them the chance to swap some holdings for sovereign bonds, with senior creditors holding some 2.4 billion given three options.  The satisfactory outcome of IBA's restructuring demonstrates that the plan supported by the Ministry of Finance serves the long-term interests of the Bank and of its creditors,  said Azeri Finance Minister Samir Sharifov in a statement. Senior creditor SOFAZ will see its $1 billion exchanged for a new 7-year IBA bond under the plan. Among the remaining senior creditors, more than 92 percent opted to swap their IBA debt for a new 15 year sovereign bond, representatives for IBA said on a conference call. Among junior bond holders, which held 100 million and were forced to take the highest haircut of 50 percent, the approval rate was still in excess of 85 percent, said IBA adviser Eric Lalo from Lazard on the call. The success of the operation would help the government meet a target of privatising IBA by the end of 2018, according to the statement. IBA Chairman Khalid Ahadov added on the call that he the lender had been approached by certain financial institutions already.  They have been waiting when the restructuring process will be successfully over, so after that they will start an official process with us,  Ahadov said. A global slump in oil prices has battered the economy of the former Soviet republic, in turn hurting Azerbaijan's manat currency and local banks. Also speaking on the call, Ian Clark from IBA's legal adviser White & Case LLP said there had been no contact with a group of creditors in New York, who had filed an objection against the restructuring plan in June. Asset managers Fidelity Management & Research Company and Franklin Templeton Investment Management Ltd and hedge funds Promeritum Fund SPC and VR Global Partners LP are members of that group, which holds some $220 million worth of IBA bonds.

Out-of-pocket spending by parents fell to 23 percent from 29 percent of the average amount the typical family pays for college, according to a survey released Monday. That translates to about $5,527 out of the average $23,757 yearly tab.  That's the lowest dollar amount spent by parents since 2009, as well as the smallest percentage of the total tuition spent since the study started.  Much of the difference was made up by a big jump in student borrowing to 19 percent of the total, from 13 percent.  Sallie Mae's study does not directly address why parental spending fell, but there are several indicators.   It could be price sensitivity,  says Mark Kantrowitz, publisher of Cappex.com, a college financing resource.  Parents may be telling students, if you want to go to that more expensive school, you'll have to pay for it.  Model Budgeting The typical family that emerges from Sallie Mae's study is not big on planning: While 9 out of 10 expect their kids to go to college, only 4 out of 10 budget for it.  But there are some bright spots, notably that 69 percent eliminated some colleges from their selections because of cost, a number that jumped from 58 percent ten years ago.  For those taking active steps, like saving in a tax-advantaged 529 plan, the road to college is a lot less bumpy.  Financial adviser Therese Nicklas serves as a model for her Boston-based clients. Her first step was deciding on a budget based on what she could reasonably save over time and what she could take from monthly cash flow to stash money away for two kids.   I told my kids, if you go over, you'll have to borrow,  says Nicklas.  Her older son was disciplined about working and graduated with less than $25,000 in loans, but her younger son racked up so much debt he had to live at home after graduation while he aggressively chipped away at it.  One way families can come up with a reasonable budget number is by filling out the federal financial aid form known as the FAFSA, regardless of whether they think they will be getting financial aid.  Sallie Mae's survey found that FAFSA participation has made a steady climb to 86 percent, 12 percent higher than in 2008.  The FAFSA calculates an  expected family contribution  which colleges can use to calculate financial aid awards. But it also may be serving as a psychological cap for what parents can reasonably shell out.   Two decades ago, college costs could be more related to buying a car. Now these costs are like buying a house. It’s two completely different scenarios,  says financial adviser Melissa Sotudeh, who is based in the Washington, D.C. area  Facing Loans While planning ahead works for parents, students have fewer options. Federal student loans max out at about $27,000, with no limit on higher-interest private borrowing.   Therese Nicklas is a big fan of leaning on student income from work rather than loans, but there's only so much of a dent a student is able to make in their total loans with their pay checks, especially if they face a massive tuition bill. Sallie Mae's survey found that 76 percent of students work to help pay their costs, with 55 percent of those working year-round.  About 1 percent of families use home equity loans or retirement plan loans, while about 3 percent put tuition on credit cards. Parents also take out federal PLUS loans and private loans.   I heavily discourage 401(k) loans. I also discourage pulling money out of Roth IRAs,  says financial adviser Jason Lina, who is based in the Atlanta area.  But credit card debt is the worst.

The EU has over 40 anti-dumping measures to aid European steel producers, mostly aimed at China. In June, the bloc set duties of up to 35.9 percent on Chinese hot-rolled steel, prompting an angry response from Beijing. Steel is the second biggest industry in the world after oil and gas and the EU's attention has recently shifted as barriers aimed at cheap Chinese imports have an impact.  While far from perfect, this outcome surpasses earlier expectations, will help cut import pressure into the EU and should boost earnings expectations for local steelmakers,  investment bank Jefferies said in a note. The European Commission, which oversees EU trade policy, launched an investigation into hot-rolled steel from Brazil, Iran, Russia and Ukraine as well as Serbia in July 2016, following a complaint by European steel association Eurofer. Its investigation found hot-rolled steel from all the countries save Serbia rose to take 12.6 percent of the EU market in the year to mid-2016 from 7.5 percent in 2013, with prices falling by about a quarter, according to the document. The Commission terminated its investigation into Serbian steel imports with no tariffs set, the document showed.  However, it is proposing duties of 16.3 percent for steel from ArcelorMittal Brasil, 17.5 percent for Usinas Siderurgicas and 15.7 percent for Companhia Siderurgica National. For Russia, NLMK would face 15.0 percent duties, MMK 33.0 percent and PAO Severstal 5.3 percent. For Iran's Mobarakeh Steel Co 23 percent duties would apply and for Ukraine's Metinvest Group [METIV.UL] 19.4 percent. The Islamic Republic is now free to export steel after the easing of international sanctions against it. Definitive duties need to be applied by October 6.

The proposed class-action complaint accused Uber of  pervasive and ongoing discrimination  because people in wheelchairs can use only a few dozen of its more than 58,000 vehicles in the city. Given Uber's growing popularity, this  substantially undermines  the benefits of New York City's prior commitment to make half of its yellow taxis wheelchair-accessible by 2020, the complaint said.  Riders either face very long wait times or can't get rides at all,  Rebecca Serbin, a staff attorney for Disability Rights Advocates, said in an interview.  The human rights law reflects the City Council's commitment to accessibility. Uber is flagrantly violating that law.  Uber had no immediate comment, having yet to review the complaint filed in state Supreme Court in Manhattan. According to the complaint, Uber offers wheelchair-accessible rides through its UberWAV service, but fewer than 100 vehicles in its city fleet provide it. The case follows lawsuits in Chicago and Washington accusing Uber of violating other laws protecting the disabled. It adds to problems affecting the San Francisco-based company, which has been beset by complaints about its workplace culture, a federal inquiry into software to help drivers avoid police, and an intellectual property lawsuit by Waymo, the self-driving car unit of Google parent Alphabet Inc. Tuesday's lawsuit was brought by the Brooklyn Center for Independence for the Disabled (BCID), Disabled in Action of Metropolitan New York, and the Taxis for All Campaign. Two other plaintiffs are Gabriela Amari of Brooklyn and Valerie Joseph of Queens Village in the city's Queens borough, who use wheelchairs and say they want to use Uber vehicles but cannot. Both work for BCID. Neither was immediately available for comment. The complaint seeks to require Uber to implement a plan  to ensure full and equal access to its services for riders who require accessible transportation.

TT is rated Long-Term Foreign and Local Currency (FC and LC) Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'BBB-' with Negative Outlook. We currently rate TT on a standalone basis. We see no negative impact on TT's credit profile from the problems at its main shareholder given a strong ring-fence around TT with dividend payments being the only source of cash being moved upstream to Otas, and there are no cross default provisions on TT's debt from Otas. A sale of Otas's 55% stake to a third party in itself should not have an impact on TT's ratings as long as this ring-fence remains in place. TT's rating is currently not constrained by Turkey's sovereign ratings (FC BB+/LC BBB-; both Stable) as we believe the Turkish government has a limited influence on TT's operations with its 31.7% minority stake. According to TT's articles of association, the Turkish government has the right to take control of the board of TT if Otas defaults on its debt. Such developments, which may be temporary, would not cause us to materially alter our view of TT's government linkage in the absence of any additional share purchase by the government. In analysing the possible scenarios that could emerge from resolving the financial difficulties at Otas, we do not expect the Turkish government to increase its minority stake in TT. However, a potential increase in the Turkish government's shareholding to a controlling stake could lead us to reassess TT's government linkage to strong. Under Fitch methodology, a strong government linkage between TT and Turkey could restrict TT's Long-Term Foreign Currency IDR to Turkey's Long-Term FC IDR. However, this is mitigated by TT's dividend payments being already limited to the company's net profit and hence constraining the amount of cash that can be up-streamed to shareholders.

UnitedHealth was losing money selling these plans when it pulled out of this market, as it and other insurers questioned the sustainability of former President Barack Obama's health reform law.  Republicans have vowed repeatedly to repeal and replace the law, but have disagreed on how to do that. A Senate effort collapsed late on Monday, prompting U.S. President Donald Trump to again call for a repeal of Obamacare with no replacement. UnitedHealth CEO Stephen Hemsley said during a call with Wall Street analysts on Tuesday that he was optimistic about the business next year, but that national and state healthcare policy were a possible drag on profit in 2018.  Related CoverageUnitedHealth CEO says national healthcare policy a risk for 2018UnitedHealth says health insurance tax raises costs At this stage in the national conversation, speculation about any outcome here would be just that,  Hemsley said. The bill's failure removed one of the benefits of the bill for insurers - the planned repeal of an industry wide health insurance tax, Leerink Partners analyst Ana Gupte said. UnitedHealth shares fell 0.7 percent to $184.97 in midday trading. Other insurers like Aetna Inc (AET.N), Anthem Inc (ANTM.N), Cigna Corp (CI.N) and Humana Inc (HUM.N) were also down on the news.       They had traded up a little on this expectation that the tax would go away next year,  Gupte said.  I think investors are saying nothing is happening for a while.   Insurers typically raise prices on health plans to pass the 3-percent premium tax onto the insured but that part of Obamacare was put on hiatus last year after both Democrats and Republicans voted to do so. It would have been permanently repealed in the failed Republican bill. UnitedHealth called on Tuesday for the permanent repeal of the health insurance tax, saying it hurts consumers. Earnings Rise UnitedHealth, which sells employer-based insurance as well as for the government programs Medicare for the elderly and Medicaid for the poor, said net earnings rose to $2.28 billion, or $2.32 per share, in the second quarter ended June 30, from $1.75 billion, or $1.81 per share, a year earlier.  Excluding items, UnitedHealth earned $2.46 per share, beating average estimate of $2.38, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Total revenue rose 7.7 percent to $50.05 billion, largely in line with estimates. The insurer said its withdrawal from Obamacare individual markets, combined with the health insurance tax deferral, reduced second-quarter revenue by about $1.8 billion and lowered revenue growth rate by 4.5 percent.

The EU has over 40 anti-dumping measures to aid European steel producers, mostly aimed at China. In June, the bloc set duties of up to 35.9 percent on Chinese hot-rolled steel, prompting an angry response from Beijing. Steel is the second biggest industry in the world after oil and gas and the EU's attention has recently shifted as barriers aimed at cheap Chinese imports have an impact.  While far from perfect, this outcome surpasses earlier expectations, will help cut import pressure into the EU and should boost earnings expectations for local steelmakers,  investment bank Jefferies said in a note. The European Commission, which oversees EU trade policy, launched an investigation into hot-rolled steel from Brazil, Iran, Russia and Ukraine as well as Serbia in July 2016, following a complaint by European steel association Eurofer. Its investigation found hot-rolled steel from all the countries save Serbia rose to take 12.6 percent of the EU market in the year to mid-2016 from 7.5 percent in 2013, with prices falling by about a quarter, according to the document. The Commission terminated its investigation into Serbian steel imports with no tariffs set, the document showed.  However, it is proposing duties of 16.3 percent for steel from ArcelorMittal Brasil, 17.5 percent for Usinas Siderurgicas and 15.7 percent for Companhia Siderurgica National. For Russia, NLMK would face 15.0 percent duties, MMK 33.0 percent and PAO Severstal 5.3 percent. For Iran's Mobarakeh Steel Co 23 percent duties would apply and for Ukraine's Metinvest Group [METIV.UL] 19.4 percent. The Islamic Republic is now free to export steel after the easing of international sanctions against it. Definitive duties need to be applied by October 6.

The town of 1,600 people in Teton County, just west of the jagged peaks of the Rocky Mountains Teton Range, is getting poised to receive as many as 100,000 visitors on Aug. 21 for the celestial event, said Johnson, who was both excited and worried. Driggs is one of hundreds of towns and cities along a 70-mile arc, stretching from Oregon to South Carolina, that are in the direct path of the moon's shadow. The full eclipse and the sun's corona around the disk of the moon will be visible for a little more than two minutes only to those within this narrow band.  Driggs and other towns like it are scrambling to prepare for the onslaught of curious visitors.  We expect gridlock,  Johnson, 46, said as he drove his pickup truck through town. Tucked amid seed potato and quinoa farms, Driggs normally enjoys a more languid pace of life, with highlights including $5 lime shakes sold on balmy summer days at the corner drug store. But with the impending eclipse, planning has kicked into high gear. To make sure nothing more than the roads will be clogged, Johnson took shipment this month of two massive generators that can be deployed at key spots along the city's sewage system to keep it flowing in case of a power outage.   We are telling our residents to hunker down,  Johnson said.  And while Johnson would have preferred to have taken his family backpacking during the time of the eclipse, he's planning to stay in town in case anything goes wrong. Books and a cardboard cutout representation of the moon eclipsing the sun on August 21, 2017 are seen at a bookstore in Jackson, Wyoming, U.S. July 12, 2017.Ann Saphir'All Hands on Deck' Over on the east side of the Teton Range, authorities are preparing for the day  kind of like a fire,  said Denise Germann, a public information officer at Grand Teton National Park. Estimating crowds is nearly impossible, she said, but  it is an 'all hands on deck' event.   The 480-square-mile park's campsites are completely booked, and it expects visitors to pour in from all over, including the bigger Yellowstone National Park, just north of the path of totality. Grand Teton will waive its $30 entry fee to keep traffic from backing up.  Slideshow (6 Images)Many of the park's 465 summer staff will be posted at trailheads and along roads to warn visitors to brace themselves for failed cellphone service, jammed roads and scarce parking, and to urge them to carry plenty of food and water, as well as bear spray to ward off wildlife. In nearby Moose, Huntley Dornan said the county had warned business owners like him to expect four times the usual number of customers in the days leading up to the eclipse.   I find that hard to believe, but I'm not going to be the guy who has his head in the sand and didn't plan for it,  said Dornan, who runs a restaurant, deli, gas station and wine shop, the last place to get supplies before entering the park from the south.  Dornan plans to park a 48-foot refrigerated trailer stocked with a couple of thousand pounds of pizza cheese, 150 pounds of ground buffalo meat, a few hundred tomatoes, and gallons of ice cream, among other provisions for the expected hordes of tourists.  On eclipse day, only people who paid as much as $100 each to attend his viewing parties will be allowed access to the narrow road on his property that offers a clear view. Security will keep others out. About 14 miles down the highway, in Jackson, Wyoming, Bobbie Reppa expects the family business to be flush with demand. She and her husband run Macy's Services, the only purveyor of portable toilets for miles. The 50 she normally has on hand simply aren't enough.   We'll be bringing them in from as far as Ogden, Utah,  she said. Editing by Ben Klayman and Bernadette Baum","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-eclipse-idUSKBN1A30WS"},

The Advertising Standards Authority, which plays a big role in regulating the industry in Britain, said it would take a harder line against adverts that feature common sexist stereotypes or which mock people who do not adopt typical gender roles.  The crackdown follows a barrage of complaints by British consumers about a 2015 campaign by Protein World for weight loss products which featured a bikini-clad model with the tag line  Are you beach body ready?  The ad, which ran on posters on the London Underground network, is no longer in circulation.  The majority of complaints relate to how women are portrayed, according to ASA research. A major review based on evidence from an independent study showed that some stereotypes could restrict the choices and opportunities of children and adults, the ASA said.   Within the ad framework, a drip-drip feed of many ads featuring gender stereotypes for certain roles for boys and girls narrows people's views in terms of aspirations, what they can do and their role in society,  said ASA senior media relations officer Matt Wilson.   That's what we are trying address in our own specific way.   Previously, the ASA ruled against ads it deemed to promote objectification, inappropriate sexualization or unhealthy body ideals. The new standards will not ban all gender stereotypes, just those that could cause  potential harm.   Adverts simply featuring a woman cleaning or a man doing DIY projects would not be considered problematic. However, an ad featuring a woman as solely responsible for cleaning up a mess made by her family, or a man failing to complete a simple household task, would do, ASA said.  The new regulations will be applied only to future advertisements. ASA said the new standards were being formed now by the Committees and Advertising Practise and were expected to be announced and go into effect in 2018.

The bank's hard currency reserves dropped to $7.80 billion - or 5.2 months of imports - last week, and traders said the central bank had sold dollars in the market at least twice since Thursday to support the local currency.  We believe that our (reserves) cover is adequate,  Patrick Njoroge, the bank's governor said, adding that some of the recent pressure on the shilling was due to bets on the outcome of the election, which takes place on Aug. 8.  There is a lot of speculation out there... and frankly some of those speculators need to chill,  he told a news conference at the central bank. Elections can be fraught and tense occasions in Kenya. The most recent one in 2013 passed relatively peacefully, but violence following the previous ballot in 2007 killed around 1,200 people. At 10:10 GMT on Tuesday, the shilling was little changed at 103.80 per dollar. Central bank currency reserves reached at record $8.27 billion at the end of May, central bank data showed. Given the drop since then, traders have expressed concerns about the bank's ability to intervene further to support the shilling should the need arise. The Kenyan currency has been broadly stable against the dollar this year and Njoroge said this trend should continue as inflation eased. He said he expected annual inflation to drop into the government's preferred band of 2.5-7.5 percent within two months as food prices continued to fall. Headline inflation raced to a five-year high of 11.7 percent in May following a drought, but it fell to 9.21 percent last month after rains boosted supplies.  We expect (inflation) to breach 7.5 (percent) within this quarter,  the central bank head said. He linked the fall in currency reserves to government payments of just over half a billion dollars that were included in the budget. Njoroge said concerns about the recent closures of at least 10 bank branches by Barclays Kenya and other lenders was  overblown,  saying technological innovations such as mobile phone banking were reducing the need for physical branches.  We cannot just be stuck on brick and mortar,  he said. (writing by John Stonestreet)","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/kenya-cenbank-idUSL5N1K91VX"},

By Claire Ruckin LONDON, July 18 (Reuters) - Banks are gearing up to launch a jumbo US$7.75bn-equivalent debt financing backing US life sciences company Avantor’s take-private of lab supplies company VWR Corp, banking sources said. Avantor, owned by New Mountain Capital, announced on 5 May it would buy VWR Corp for about US$4.38bn. Goldman Sachs, Barclays and Jefferies have underwritten the debt financing and are preparing to launch syndication, which could happen within the next week in a bid to sell down risk before the summer period kicks in, the sources said. If the financing hasn’t launched by around July 26, the likelihood is that any sell down will wait until September, the sources said. At launch, more banks are expected to join the line up alongside the lead underwriters. Avantor and VWR were not immediately available to comment. “There is a short term window to launch new deals before the summer slowdown. The US and European leveraged markets are hot right now and there is appetite, but launches need to happen within the next week otherwise they will miss the boat,” a senior banker said. This is the second jumbo deal banks are considering launching within the next week, as underwriters on a €3bn financing backing a potential buyout of German generic drugmaker Stada decide whether to bring the deal to market before knowing the outcome of the takeover offer. The US$7.75bn-equivalent financing backing Avantor’s acquisition of VWR comprises a US$5bn senior secured first-lien term loan that will include around a €1bn tranche; a US$2.25bn senior unsecured bridge facility; and a US$500m revolving credit facility. There is also preferred equity totalling US$2bn senior and US$650m junior. There has been various de-risking of the deal in the US already and some of the unsecured bridge facility and preferred pieces have already been syndicated. The financing has been long awaited by investors, eager to put a meaningful amount of money to work in a larger cross-border deal. Having done some background on the deal in anticipation of its launch, it is expected the financing should be able to work its way through the market and sold down quickly, the sources said. “Syndication is starting from a very educated base as everyone has known it’s coming for a long time, so people started work ahead of time,” a second banker said. Avantor entered into a definitive agreement to acquire VWR for US$33.25 per share in cash, representing an enterprise value of US$6.4bn. The merger will create a global lab equipment giant supplying everything from beakers to microscopes to the healthcare and technology industries. The deal combines Avantor's strength in manufacturing and its presence in emerging markets with VWR's distribution network in the Americas and Europe, the companies said previously. Avantor, formed in August 2010 when New Mountain Capital purchased the business from Covidien Inc, manufactures materials and chemicals for the biopharma industry. VWR, a company that traces its roots to the California Gold Rush in the 1850s, was bought by Madison Dearborn Partners in 2007 and went public in October 2014.

Toshiba is scrambling to sell its flash memory unit to cover losses from its bankrupt U.S. nuclear business Westinghouse but it has been locked in a legal battle with Western Digital, which is a joint venture partner in the memory chip business. In June, Toshiba announced its preferred bidder was a group made up of Japanese-government backed funds, Bain Capital and South Korean chip maker SK Hynix. Western Digital, which also wants to buy the memory chip business, sought an injunction to block the transaction, arguing that any sale required its consent. Western Digital CEO Steve Milligan is meeting with officials who were recently appointed to senior positions at the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI), the sources said.  METI has been trying to orchestrate the sale in an effort to keep Toshiba's semiconductor technology in domestic hands.

It is unclear whether Milligan will meet Toshiba executives, said the sources, who declined to be named because the talks were private.

The 440-page report chronicles teachers doling out physical violence including slapping boys in the face so hard that the marks could be seen the next day, whipping them with wooden sticks and violin bows and subjecting them to severe beatings.  Boys who tried to escape the  Regensburger Domspatzen , or Regensburg Cathedral Sparrows, were hauled back into the school and beaten and humiliated in front of other boys, it said. Allegations of abuse at the school, which dates back over a thousand years and now tours the world to perform choral music, surfaced in 2010.  After criticism of that investigation, the diocese, which acknowledged on Tuesday it had  made mistakes , commissioned lawyer Ulrich Weber in 2015 to put together the independent report. Former Pope Benedict's brother, Georg Ratzinger, 93, led the choir from 1964 to 1994. He acknowledged in 2010 that he had slapped pupils in the face but said he had not realized how brutal the discipline was. Weber said he was  to be blamed especially for turning a blind eye and not intervening despite having knowledge , adding the investigation did not show he was aware of sexual abuse. Several testimonies said he was generally friendly.  It was not possible to contact Ratzinger for a comment.  Weber said the system was focused on achieving musical excellence choral success and to that end, a high degree of discipline was commonplace. That provided a basis for violence.   Severely Traumatized   He found that a total of 547 former pupils had probably  been victims of physical and/or sexual violence. Of those, some 67 suffered sexual abuse.  He blamed 49 individuals, 45 of whom were physically violent and nine of whom were believed to have committed sexual violence.   Victims ... described the institution as a prison, hell and a concentration camp,  Weber told a news conference.    Many of them called the time there as the worst of their lives which was marked by violence, fear and helplessness.  Allegations of sexual and physical abuse in Catholic schools in Germany, in particular in the former pope's native Bavaria, have shaken the church and abuse scandals have also rocked it in the United States, Austria and Ireland.  Choir school victims, many of whom implored their parents to let them come home, said they were still traumatized.   These are not 547 cases where an individual was affected once. Rather, this was an ongoing practice over decades where 547 children were tormented, abused, mistreated and socially harmed,  former choir boy and abuse victim Alexander Probst told Reuters TV.   They are severely traumatized to this very day. This upsets me. I thought I had gotten over it after a seven-year battle but in fact this greatly upset me today.  The Diocese of Regensburg acknowledged its past mistakes and said it wanted to find out what happened and deal with it.  We all made mistakes and have learned a lot. We see today that we could have done things better and sooner,  said Michael Fuchs, General Vicar of Regensburg Diocese.

Toshiba is scrambling to sell its flash memory unit to cover losses from its bankrupt U.S. nuclear business Westinghouse but it has been locked in a legal battle with Western Digital, which is a joint venture partner in the memory chip business. In June, Toshiba announced its preferred bidder was a group made up of Japanese-government backed funds, Bain Capital and South Korean chip maker SK Hynix. Western Digital, which also wants to buy the memory chip business, sought an injunction to block the transaction, arguing that any sale required its consent. Western Digital CEO Steve Milligan is meeting with officials who were recently appointed to senior positions at the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI), the sources said.  METI has been trying to orchestrate the sale in an effort to keep Toshiba's semiconductor technology in domestic hands.  A U.S. court judge on Friday postponed a decision on Western Digital's injunction request and proposed requiring Toshiba to give the U.S. company two weeks notice before closing the sale. It is unclear whether Milligan will meet Toshiba executives, said the sources, who declined to be named because the talks were private. A Western Digital spokeswoman confirmed Milligan's visit to Japan but declined to comment on details.

Start with a then-and-now comparison. When the global financial system nearly collapsed about a decade ago, the world's major central banks launched a series of aggressive counter-measures, including trillions of dollars worth of asset-buying. The global economics team at Bank of America-Merrill Lynch - in a report that argues central banks are not currently capable of responding to a new crisis - calculate that from 2006 to 2009 the five major central banks cut rates by an average of about 350 basis point. Could they do that now? Short answer, no. BofAML reckons the current average nominal policy rate is just 50 basis points, with the European Central Bank and Bank of Japan in particular at the bottom limit of what they can do.  It is not the first time this concern has been raised. The Bank for International Settlements, often called the central banks' bank, fired a warning shot two years ago.  In some jurisdictions, monetary policy is already testing its outer limits,  it said in its 2014/2015 annual report. In the same vein, Stephen King, HSBC's senior economic adviser, has noted that in all U.S. recessions since the 1970s, the benchmark Federal Reserve interest rate has fallen by a minimum of 5 percentage points. It is currently at a range of 1 percent to 1.25 percent. Similarly, central banks have been buying up the shop since 2008, when the financial crisis hit and the Great Recession began. Between them, the U.S., Swiss, British, Japanese and euro zone central banks have balance sheets -- essentially cash and asset holdings -- totaling roughly $15 trillion. That compares with only around $4 trillion at the start of 2008. They could and probably would expand this in a crisis; central banks have shown great innovation in the past. But with the store of assets available to buy dwindling as a result of the $15 trillion, any expansion would have to be far broader. Doable, but relatively untried and possibly politically difficult.   A man rides a bicycle past the Bank of Japan (BOJ) building in Tokyo, Japan March 18, 2009.Yuriko Nakao/File PhotoInflation Key Despite the huge monetary largesse, inflation remains low and well below target in all major industrialized economies bar Brexit-hit Britain - and even there it may be easing back because of the ebbing of base effects from sterling's fall. This means that central banks such as the Fed, ECB, Bank of England and Bank of Japan are all making noises of varying hawkishness without necessarily having solved their main problem. The Fed has already started tightening and is talking about cutting its balance sheet, the Bank of England is at least thinking about raising rates, and the ECB is hinting at tapering its asset-buying. Even the Bank of Japan, or some members, have been quietly retreating from its radical monetary experiment. FILE PHOTO - The U.S. Federal Reserve Building is shown in Washington, March 18, 2008.Jason ReedIronically, it is this desire to normalize that some economists believe is the main risk for global economic growth and for the next downturn.  In the past, some recessions have been caused by central banks acting too aggressively,  Sarah Hewin, chief European economist at Standard Chartered Bank, said, adding that her firm did not see any sustained inflation pressures to rationalize tightening. BofAML economists Ethan Harris and Aditya Bhave go further, saying central banks should prepare for the next recession by keep the taps open to overshoot their inflation targets, not make do with bumping up close to them.  In other words, let inflation spike, then tighten. What then, if a downturn hits first, before normalization of monetary policy? Innovation. The idea of  helicopter money  has already been floated, involving anything from direct transfers to the private sector to monetizing government deficits by direct bond sales between government and central bank.  Then, there is always the government itself, opening up its own purse.  There will be greater need for a fiscal response, as monetary policy alone will not be as effective,  said Leila Butt, senior economist at Prudential Portfolio Management Group. Central banks can't do everything, especially when the have already been doing it for close to a decade.

The Libyan Investment Authority (LIA), which holds about $66 billion-worth of mostly frozen assets, is the subject a long ownership struggle in a country where rival factions support different governments.      The fund is a potentially important source of income for Libya, whose economy is in crisis because of conflict, diminished oil revenues and bloated public salary and subsidy bills. The U.N.-backed Government of National Accord (GNA) said the new board of trustees included the GNA's prime minister, the ministers of finance, planning, and economy, and the governor of the Tripoli's central bank.  They held an inaugural meeting on Saturday, where they appointed a board of directors made up of members of an LIA steering committee that the GNA nominated in 2016.    Under the new legal framework, the board of directors will have the full authority to deliver the strategic, operational and legal vision of the LIA, by building an institution that is transparent, accountable and neutral,  a GNA statement said. Head of the board of directors, Ali Mahmoud Hassan Mohamed, said:  This positive move forward provides us with the mandate and the authority to continue the reform programme we initiated last year.   The GNA's steering committee nominated last year was challenged by AbdulMagid Breish, who was appointed LIA chairman in Tripoli in 2013, leading to a struggle for control of the LIA's main offices in Tripoli.  Breish, who said the committee was illegal because the GNA has never been endorsed by a parliament based in eastern Libya, won a legal appeal against its creation. He has previously said any attempt by the GNA to set up a board of trustees would be  a blatant abuse of power . Ali Shamekh, who was appointed chief executive of the LIA by authorities in eastern Libya in 2016, also questioned the latest move by the GNA, saying a board of trustees under Libya's eastern government had already filed a court appeal against the new, rival board.    The GNA said the formation of its boards was in accordance with a law regulating the LIA and that any move to contest it would be  destabilising .  A U.N. report last month pointed to losses due to the failure to reinvest LIA investments that have matured, but concluded that it would be difficult to modify the sanctions regime while the fund remained divided.

The process, European Union officials say, will require a series of successful bond sales and the build-up of a  sizeable  cash buffer.  Euro zone creditors are keen to see Athens develop a strategy to tap the markets well before the end of its current 86-billion-euro financial aid program, so that when the bailout expires in August 2018 the country will be more likely to stand on its own feet. But at the same time, there is concern about potential Greek complacency or backtracking that could necessitate an extension of financial support and continued monitoring of Greece's  reforms. Three EU officials, asking not to be named, told Reuters that Athens' first task should be to refrain from any hints about retreating from agreed reforms. That would increase instability, especially as the country comes under markets' close watch again. A return to markets is on the cards soon. Investors expect Greece to raise at least 3 billion euros in five-year bonds once its benchmark borrowing costs drop below 5 percent, a level it is fast approaching GR10YT=TWEB.  It would be the country's first borrowing since 2014 when it briefly returned to markets with two issuances before plunging again into financial trouble. In that sale, it raised in the first issuance 3 billion euros with five-year bonds yielding 4.95 percent. Who buys the bonds will also be key for Greece. To be deemed successful, one euro zone official said, a new sale should attract mostly foreign capital, with minimal participation of Greek banks. Prolonged Monitoring? Even if the issuance is successful in terms of investors interest and yields, euro zone officials also caution that Athens should not relax, because part of the money is meant to be used to build cash buffers. The European Commission has said Greece should set aside around 9 billion euros to cover financing needs for the first 10 months after the end of the bailout program. Part of this money is expected to come from savings and new euro zone loans under the existing program. But a chunk of the buffer should be built also with the funds borrowed from the markets, two of the officials said. To reach the target buffer and fully rebuild its creditor reputation, Greece should tap the markets more than once before August 2018, and with issuances of different, longer maturities, officials added. Backtracking on reforms, even if bond issuances were successful, could increase creditors' appetite to push Greece to consider a precautionary credit line from the euro zone bailout fund, the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), after the end of its current bailout program, the third since 2010, officials said. Other euro zone countries which received financial aid after the 2010-2012 bloc's debt crisis, such as Ireland and Portugal, refused to use this facility, which is meant to calm markets with a guarantee of support in exchange for prolonged international monitoring on reforms and savings.    Greece would have to ask for this support, a politically unpalatable move in Athens, but a measure seen as useful by creditors to keep control on the country at least until agreed reforms on pensions and tax are implemented in 2019 and 2020.

The Tricastin plant has four pressurised water reactors with an installed capacity of 915 megawatts (MW) each. EDF said on its website that output at reactors 1 and 3 was reduced by 735 MW and 651 MW respectively. It said this was done for  environmental issues,  without giving further details. A company spokeswoman said that, due to a heatwave in France on Tuesday, the company decided to reduce the amount of heated non-radioactive water from the cooling systems that flows into a canal near the plant and into the Rhone river.  This was done so as not to increase the temperature of the already heated water and thus preserve plant and animal life,  she said, adding that a heavy thunderstorm forecast for the area later on Tuesday was expected to cool the situation. EDF said it expected output at the reactors to return to normal on Wednesday. France has recorded scorching temperatures in the past couple of days, with the mercury in some areas in the south and southeastern France hitting 38 degrees Celsius (100 degrees Fahrenheit), according to Meteo France. Available nuclear power, which provides over 75 percent of France's electricity needs, rose above 70 percent of capacity on Tuesday afternoon from 68 percent previously as the restart of EDF's 1,300 MW St Alban 1 reactor was ramped up.

Yields on the 10-year note, which move inversely to prices, dropped to three-week lows, while those on the 30-year bond slid to their lowest in two weeks.  The uncertainty in Washington may be giving a little bit of a bid in Treasury prices,  said Lou Brien, market strategist at DRW Trading in Chicago. After two Republicans said they would not back the latest Obamacare rollback bill, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell was weighing a vote on simply repealing the 2010 healthcare law with no replacement. Investors fretted about the growing division within U.S. President Donald Trump's Republican party that has hampered the administration's legislative policy goals. Tuesday's economic data also weighed on sentiment. U.S. import prices fell for a second straight month in June amid further declines in the cost of petroleum products, evidence of tepid inflation that could further reduce chances of another Federal Reserve interest rate hike in December. In mid-morning trading, U.S. 10-year yields fell to 2.267 percent from 2.309 percent late on Monday. Yields earlier hit a three-week low of 2.266 percent. DRW's Brien said the drop below the key 2.30 percent yield on the 10-year was a significant technical indicator that would suggest further buying in Treasuries. The next key level for 10-year yields would be 2.25 percent, Brien added. U.S. 30-year bonds were down 21/32 in price to yield 2.859 percent, from 2.893 percent Monday. Those yields earlier touched a two-week low of 2.858 percent. U.S. two-year yields were down at 1.351 percent from Monday's 1.36 percent. The yield curve continued to flatten on Tuesday. The gap between shorter-dated and longer-dated Treasury yields fell further, with the spread between five-year and 30-year yields narrowing to 103.90 basis points. The same was true for the spread between U.S. two-year and 10-year notes, with the gap shrinking slightly to 92.10 basis points, the tightest in two weeks. Analysts, however, continued to price in a steepening of the yield curve, as a move away from interest rate hikes would support Treasury prices on the short end, while low inflation would prompt investors to sell the long end of the curve.

The Libyan Investment Authority (LIA), which holds about $66 billion-worth of mostly frozen assets, is the subject a long ownership struggle in a country where rival factions support different governments.      The fund is a potentially important source of income for Libya, whose economy is in crisis because of conflict, diminished oil revenues and bloated public salary and subsidy bills. The U.N.-backed Government of National Accord (GNA) said the new board of trustees included the GNA's prime minister, the ministers of finance, planning, and economy, and the governor of the Tripoli's central bank.  They held an inaugural meeting on Saturday, where they appointed a board of directors made up of members of an LIA steering committee that the GNA nominated in 2016.    Under the new legal framework, the board of directors will have the full authority to deliver the strategic, operational and legal vision of the LIA, by building an institution that is transparent, accountable and neutral,  a GNA statement said. Head of the board of directors, Ali Mahmoud Hassan Mohamed, said:  This positive move forward provides us with the mandate and the authority to continue the reform programme we initiated last year.   The GNA's steering committee nominated last year was challenged by AbdulMagid Breish, who was appointed LIA chairman in Tripoli in 2013, leading to a struggle for control of the LIA's main offices in Tripoli.  Breish, who said the committee was illegal because the GNA has never been endorsed by a parliament based in eastern Libya, won a legal appeal against its creation. He has previously said any attempt by the GNA to set up a board of trustees would be  a blatant abuse of power . Ali Shamekh, who was appointed chief executive of the LIA by authorities in eastern Libya in 2016, also questioned the latest move by the GNA, saying a board of trustees under Libya's eastern government had already filed a court appeal against the new, rival board.    The GNA said the formation of its boards was in accordance with a law regulating the LIA and that any move to contest it would be  destabilising .  A U.N. report last month pointed to losses due to the failure to reinvest LIA investments that have matured, but concluded that it would be difficult to modify the sanctions regime while the fund remained divided.

One of those remanded in custody on suspicion of belonging to a terrorist organization was Amnesty International's Turkey director, Idil Eser. Amnesty said truth and justice had become  total strangers . Eser, the German Peter Steudtner and eight other activists were detained this month while attending a workshop on digital security near Istanbul. A Turkish prosecutor asked a court on Monday to extend their detention pending trial on suspicion of links to the network of Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom Ankara blames for last year's attempted coup. The court ordered four of the 10 released, the newspaper Hurriyet said. In unscheduled remarks at a ceremony for athletes, Merkel said the case was another example of innocent people being  caught up in the wheels of the justice system . She said Steudtner's arrest was absolutely unjustified.  We declare our solidarity with him and all the others arrested ... the German government will do all it can, on all levels, to secure his release.  The comments were likely to further strain ties between Berlin and Ankara. These are already beset by a host of issues including Ankara's arrest of Deniz Yucel, a Turkish-German dual national who is a correspondent for the German newspaper Die Welt, on charges of spreading propaganda in support of a terrorist organization and inciting violence..  Political Witch-Hunt  Amnesty International's secretary general, Salil Shetty, said the decision to keep six of the activists in detention  shows that truth and justice have become total strangers in Turkey .  This is not a legitimate investigation,  he said,  this is a politically motivated witch-hunt that charts a frightening future for rights in Turkey.  In June, authorities detained Amnesty's local board chairman, Taner Kilic, along with 22 other lawyers, also for suspected links to Gulen, who has condemned the coup attempt and denied any involvement.  Some 150,000 people have been sacked or suspended from jobs in the civil service, military and private sector and roughly 50,000 people have been detained since the coup. Rights groups and some Western allies say Turkey is using the crackdown to quash all dissent. Opposition media outlets have been closed and around 160 journalists detained. Turkey is now the world's biggest jailer of journalists, according to the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists. The government - which on Monday extended the state of emergency brought in after the failed putsch for another three months - says such measures are necessary because of the gravity of the security threat. Steudtner's friends, family members and colleagues urged Turkey to release him immediately, saying in a statement that he and his Swedish colleague, Ali Gharavi, had been on an assignment for a development organization.

The heavily weighted financials group slipped 0.5 percent. Canada's biggest banks were among the most influential losers on the index, but individuals stocks were only down marginally. The materials group, home to precious and base metals miners as well as fertilizer companies, lost 0.2 percent as a retreat in base metal prices weighed, offsetting the boost gold miners received from higher bullion prices. First Quantum Minerals Ltd fell 2.5 percent to C$13.35, while Tech Resources Ltd declined 1.2 percent to C$24.25. Zinc and other base metal prices were dragged lower by profit-taking and producer selling after data showed China's property market had slowed. Losses were somewhat tempered by higher gold prices, which helped give a number of gold miners a modest lift. The price of bullion rose on the back of a weaker U.S. dollar amid setbacks for the U.S. Trump Administration and scaled back expectations for another Federal Reserve rate hike this year. Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd slipped 1.4 percent to C$205.43. The overall industrials group fell 0.7 percent. At 10:29 a.m. ET (1429 GMT), the Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P;/TSX composite index fell 58.81 points, or 0.39 percent, to 15,106.55. Energy stocks, which climbed 0.4 percent, was the lone gainer among the index's 10 key sectors. Crude oil prices rose on higher demand, with U.S. crude prices up 0.6 percent to $46.29 a barrel. Encana Corp rose 0.9 percent to C$11.97, while ARC Resources Ltd gained 0.9 percent to C$17.32. In economic data, lending to Canadian small businesses rose to 124.2 in May from 121.9 in April on stronger activity in the agriculture and consumer sectors, according to the PayNet Small Business Lending Index. This suggested companies were becoming more willing to invest two years after a slump in oil prices hit the economy.

Speaking on Mexican television, Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo also raised questions about U.S. hopes to scrap the North American Free Trade Agreement's Chapter 19 dispute settlement mechanism that hinders the United States in pursuing anti-dumping and anti-subsidy cases against Mexico and Canada. Talking by telephone from Japan, Guajardo likened the U.S. desire to cut trade deficits with its NAFTA partners Mexico and Canada to a  mercantilist  vision of international trade.  What I have said insistently in my conversations with my colleagues is that we're delighted to review trade balances provided that we focus on how to improve them by expanding commerce, not by reducing it,  he said. U.S. President Donald Trump has pushed for a renegotiation of NAFTA, threatening to dump it if he cannot rework the accord to the benefit of the United States. He argues it has fueled a trade deficit with Mexico and cost thousands of U.S. jobs. Guajardo said the document sent by U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to lawmakers on Monday contained  no surprises , and he explicitly welcomed parts of it, including plans to enshrine anti-corruption provisions in NAFTA.    What is positive is that (the United States) themselves paraphrased that they won't reintroduce quotas or tariffs during this process (of renegotiation),  he added. Aside from his concern over Chapter 19, Guajardo also expressed doubts about the United States' intention to get rid of NAFTA's so-called  global safeguard exclusion  that curbs Washington's ability to impose measures on others.  This will all have to be subject to the three sides being in agreement in the process,  he said. One Mexican official told Reuters on Monday he expected the Canadian government to fight to the  death  on Chapter 19, suggesting it could become a major bone of contention in negotiations due to begin next month. Both Mexico and the United States face important elections in 2018 which could complicate the NAFTA revamp, and Guajardo has said it would be in the interests of both nations to wrap up the three-way talks by the end of this year. However, there was no guarantee the process would be finished as quickly as they would like, Guajardo said.

The process, European Union officials say, will require a series of successful bond sales and the build-up of a  sizeable  cash buffer.  Euro zone creditors are keen to see Athens develop a strategy to tap the markets well before the end of its current 86-billion-euro financial aid program, so that when the bailout expires in August 2018 the country will be more likely to stand on its own feet. But at the same time, there is concern about potential Greek complacency or backtracking that could necessitate an extension of financial support and continued monitoring of Greece's  reforms. Three EU officials, asking not to be named, told Reuters that Athens' first task should be to refrain from any hints about retreating from agreed reforms. That would increase instability, especially as the country comes under markets' close watch again. A return to markets is on the cards soon. Investors expect Greece to raise at least 3 billion euros in five-year bonds once its benchmark borrowing costs drop below 5 percent, a level it is fast approaching GR10YT=TWEB.  It would be the country's first borrowing since 2014 when it briefly returned to markets with two issuances before plunging again into financial trouble. In that sale, it raised in the first issuance 3 billion euros with five-year bonds yielding 4.95 percent. Who buys the bonds will also be key for Greece. To be deemed successful, one euro zone official said, a new sale should attract mostly foreign capital, with minimal participation of Greek banks. Prolonged Monitoring? Even if the issuance is successful in terms of investors interest and yields, euro zone officials also caution that Athens should not relax, because part of the money is meant to be used to build cash buffers. The European Commission has said Greece should set aside around 9 billion euros to cover financing needs for the first 10 months after the end of the bailout program. Part of this money is expected to come from savings and new euro zone loans under the existing program. But a chunk of the buffer should be built also with the funds borrowed from the markets, two of the officials said. To reach the target buffer and fully rebuild its creditor reputation, Greece should tap the markets more than once before August 2018, and with issuances of different, longer maturities, officials added. Backtracking on reforms, even if bond issuances were successful, could increase creditors' appetite to push Greece to consider a precautionary credit line from the euro zone bailout fund, the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), after the end of its current bailout program, the third since 2010, officials said. Other euro zone countries which received financial aid after the 2010-2012 bloc's debt crisis, such as Ireland and Portugal, refused to use this facility, which is meant to calm markets with a guarantee of support in exchange for prolonged international monitoring on reforms and savings.

The Egyptian blue chip index, which had closed at a record high on Monday, sank 1.7 percent in rising turnover - a negative technical sign. The broader EGX100 dropped 1.6 percent. Ezz Steel plunged 10 percent after it reported a quarterly consolidated net loss after tax and minority interests of 521 million Egyptian pounds ($29.2 million), versus a loss of 137 million pounds a year ago. The company said it had suffered from a very low rate of capacity utilisation because of a working capital shortage after the devaluation of the Egyptian pound; it expects to cover the working capital gap gradually in coming quarters. Arabian Food Industries (Domty) slid 5.6 percent after reporting a second-quarter net profit of 12 million pounds, below some analysts' estimates. Large-cap Orascom Telecom Media slipped 4.2 percent as its subsidiary Beltone Financial lost 3.6 percent. In Dubai, the index dropped 0.7 percent to 3,578 points after rising for seven straight sessions through Monday, but it held technical support at 3,573 points, the April peak. DAMAC, which had led the rally, fell back 9.0 percent in heavy profit-taking. The Saudi index slipped 0.5 percent. Saudi Kayan rose in early trade but closed 2.1 percent lower after reporting its second-quarter net profit climbed to 242 million riyals ($64.5 million) from 97.3 million riyals a year ago; analysts had on average predicted 212 million riyals. Qassim Cement fell 0.4 percent after it reported a quarterly profit of 53.2 million riyals versus 113.9 million riyals; analysts had on average expected 66 million riyals. But National Co for Glass Industries jumped its 10 percent daily limit after reporting a 224 percent leap in quarterly net profit, although operating profit actually fell sharply. Jouf Cement gained 4.8 percent after shareholders approved a 10 percent capital increase via an issue of bonus shares, to be paid for with the company's retained earnings. Qatar's index slipped 0.5 percent as Masraf Al Rayan , the second-largest bank by market value, dropped 1.4 percent. It reported flat quarterly net profit, in line with analysts' forecasts, suggesting the impact of Qatar's diplomatic crisis has so far been minor. Customer deposits were 61.21 billion riyals ($16.8 billion) at the end of June, up 5.9 percent from a year earlier but down 3 percent from the previous quarter. Al Khalij Commercial Bank, which reported flat first-half earnings, slipped 1.8 percent and Ahli Bank, which reported a 3 percent rise in net profit for the first half, closed flat. Highlights Saudi Arabia * The index dropped 0.5 percent to 7,255 points. Dubai * The index fell 0.7 percent to 3,578 points. Abu Dhabi * The index edged down 0.1 percent to 4,572 points.

Sudan's economic problems have been building since the south seceded in 2011, taking with it three-quarters of the country's oil output, the main source of foreign currency and government income. The United States lifted 20-year-old sanctions in January for six months, suspending a trade embargo, unfreezing assets and removing financial penalties that weigh on Sudan's economy. But it said Sudan had to make progress on key issues, including internal conflicts, before it would lift the sanctions permanently. Last week, the United States extended the review by three months, citing human rights concerns. Currency traders said that decision has sent the pound reeling as people buy up dollars amid an ongoing shortage.  After the U.S. decision, there has been huge demand for buying dollars at any price. There is a panic to buy dollars and a major scarcity of it in the market,  said one black market currency trader. Sudan's central bank has held the official exchange rate at 6.7 pounds to the dollar.  We expect a further rise in the price of the pound currency because the government does not have any money to inject into the banks,  another currency trader said.

A surge in fighting between militias in several hotspots has uprooted more than 100,000 people since April, in the worst spell of displacement since the peak of the conflict in 2014, say aid groups including the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC). More than 1 million people are displaced - about half are living as refugees in neighboring countries - and nearly one in two people - at least 2.2 million - need aid, according to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).  It is tragic to see so many people displaced by mindless conflict and brutal atrocities ... the country is experiencing a deteriorating cycle of violence,  the U.N. humanitarian chief, Stephen O'Brien, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  It has the worst level of humanitarian needs per capita,  O'Brien added by phone from Bangui, calling on donors to boost support to avert the risk of a repeat of the  devastating large-scale crisis that gripped the country only four years ago . The country's humanitarian response plan for 2017 has been less than quarter funded - $118 million of a requested $497 million - the U.N.'s Financial Tracking Service (FTS) shows. Central African Republic has been plagued by conflict since March 2013, when mainly Muslim Seleka rebels seized power, triggering reprisals by Christian  anti-balaka  militias.  The Seleka and other groups have since splintered, prompting further violence despite the election in March 2016 of President Faustin-Archange Touadera, which raised hopes of reconciliation. Thirteen of the 14 armed groups along with representatives from the government signed a peace deal last month, yet as many as 100 people were killed in the town of Bria, northeast of the capital Bangui, in fighting between factions the very next day. Fighting has since continued and intensified in towns such as Bangassou and Zemio, where militants last week shot and killed a baby in a hospital, forcing aid agency Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) to temporarily suspend its operations there. Children are being increasingly targeted in the violence - ending up victims of murder, abduction, rape and recruitment into armed groups, said the U.N. children's agency (UNICEF).   The peace agreement brought hope, but this hope has been shattered by the increase in violence and new displacement during the last weeks,  said Eric Batonon, NRC country head.  We need to wake up to the fact that the Central African Republic is again spiraling towards a devastating crisis.

Unedic's EUR37 billion euro medium-term note (EMTN) programme has also been affirmed at 'AA' and 'F1+'. Its EUR10 billion commercial paper programme (NeuCP) programme has been affirmed at 'F1+' and its EUR8 billion medium-term notes (NeuMTN) at 'AA'. The affirmation reflects the unchanged links between Unedic and the French State (AA/Stable) over the last 12 months. Fitch classifies Unedic as an entity credit-linked to France under its top down-approach in its 'Rating of Public Sector Entities - Outside the United States' criteria, in light of the very strong expected extraordinary support from the state. The ratings reflect Unedic's mission as sole manager of the French unemployment insurance system (UIS) under state delegation. They are underpinned by the French Labour Code regulating Unedic's financial stability, and by support from the government through its approval of the unemployment insurance agreement. KEY RATING DRIVERS Legal Status (Midrange) UNEDIC is a private law association created in 1958 to provide unemployment insurance, which is a mandatory state responsibility. It is managed by the social partners comprising trade unions' and employers' representatives. They negotiate every two to three years a convention that has to be approved by the State. The convention defines the unemployment insurance financing mechanisms for the next three years with a legal obligation for a balanced budget under the French Labour Code. A new convention was adopted in April 2017 and approved by decree in May and will become effective in October 2017 for a three-year period. The association can be dissolved at its members' discretion. Strategic importance (Stronger) UNEDIC exercises a mandatory state responsibility through a State delegation under the Labour Code. At end-2016 it provided compulsory unemployment insurance to 16.8 million private sector employees and unemployment benefits to 3.4 million jobseekers. Its counter-cyclical activity makes it one of the most important economic stabilisers in France during economic difficulties. Should the social partners fail to reach an agreement, the State will extend the current convention or even take over the whole unemployment insurance system. Control (Midrange) Although the State does not exercise formal control over Unedic, it supervises its management through the presence of a State comptroller in Unedic's governance institutions and through its approval of the unemployment insurance agreement. In the absence of approval of the insurance agreement, the State is responsible for Unedic's debt repayment. Integration (Stronger) UNEDIC's integration within the French State is strong as the association's debt is included in the general government gross debt under the Maastricht criteria and as the association's long-term debt benefits from an explicit guarantee from the State. The State provides an explicit guarantee every year on Unedic's issuance under its EUR37 billion EMTN programme (EUR5 billion in both 2017 and 2016). As of end-June 2017, 77% of its gross debt benefited from the explicit state guarantee. The guarantee exempts Unedic from the application of article L.213-15 of the monetary code, which mandates associations with shrinking equity to recapitalise or lose the ability to issue bonds. As marketable debt instruments, issues from the NeuMTN and NeuCP programmes do not fall under the scope of this legal provision and therefore the state guarantee is not required. The EUR10 billion NeuCP programme is sufficiently covered by a liquidity buffer corresponding to 15 days of either total expenditure or CP repayments, with a minimum amount of EUR2 billion. In case of adverse market conditions, Fitch believes that this buffer would be sufficient to meet immediate liquidity needs before the State steps in to provide financial support to Unedic, which would be forthcoming in view of its strategic importance. Unedic's performance is sensitive to economic cycles and has to be viewed in light of the association's not-for-profit mission and counter-cyclical role as an economic and social buffer. In 2016 the annual deficit reached EUR4.2 billion (2016: EUR4.17 billion) due to mild economic growth. Over the medium term, Unedic projects a gradual improvement based on the national economic recovery and on the savings and extra revenue generated by the new convention signed in April 2017. Its annual deficit is expected to reduce to EUR3.6 billion in 2017 and to shrink to negligible levels by 2021. Since 2009 insufficient coverage of unemployment benefits by contributions paid by private sector employers and employees has caused Unedic's net financial debt to rise significantly, to EUR27.8 billion from EUR4.9bn in 2008. It is likely to reach EUR34 billion in 2017 according to the latest projections from Unedic. It should, however, start declining after 2020 as Unedic's accounts reach a balance based on the association's projections. RATING SENSITIVITIES Rating actions on the sovereign would be reflected by Unedic's ratings. A significant unfavourable change to UIS's characteristics would also prompt a downgrade as would a weaker liquidity back-up package.

Barack Obama, then U.S. president, ordered the seizure of two Russian diplomatic compounds in New York and Maryland and the expulsion of 35 Russian diplomats in December over what he said was their involvement in hacking the 2016 U.S. presidential election campaign, something Russia flatly denies. President Vladimir Putin decided not to retaliate at the time, saying he would wait to see what the new administration of Donald Trump would do.  But Trump, besieged by a regular stream of questions about his associates' purported links to Russia, has scant room for maneuver. He risks being accused of being overly friendly to Moscow if he hands back the compounds without getting something politically substantial in return. Moscow had said a lot would depend on the outcome of a meeting in Washington on Monday between Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov and U.S. Undersecretary of State Thomas Shannon. The meeting ended without agreement. The Russian Foreign Ministry said its patience was wearing thin.  The Russian side stressed (in the meeting) that if Washington does not remove this and other irritants, including continued obstacles to the work of our diplomatic institutions, we reserve the right to take retaliatory measures based on the principle of reciprocity,  it said in a statement. Russia has complained that U.S. officials are not issuing visas to its diplomats, preventing it from replacing its staff who were expelled in December.  Deputy Foreign Minister Ryabkov said he had submitted a list of things that needed to be done to improve battered US-Russia ties. Reports of a breakthrough being close were wide of the mark, he said.  To say we are on the brink of finding a solution and sorting out this situation would be an exaggeration,  Ryabkov told the TASS news agency.  Such unacceptable and contradictory actions cannot be left without a response.  The U.S. State Department said that the talks on areas of mutual concern had been  tough, forthright, and deliberate, reflecting both parties’ commitment to a resolution.  But though it said the talks had reflected a spirit of goodwill, it said it was clear  that more work needs to be done.  It said an agreement had been reached to hold talks focusing on strategic stability and the reduction of strategic arms, however.

Ericsson shares fell more than 11 percent to 54.20 crowns by 1110 GMT, with the figures fuelling concerns that plans by CEO Borje Ekholm, who took charge in January, will not be enough to restore profitability. The company is facing mounting competition from China's Huawei [HWT.UL] and Finland's Nokia as well as weak emerging markets and falling spending by telecoms operators with demand for next-generation 5G technology still years away. Ericsson has responded by cutting jobs and costs but those efforts are yet to stop the rot.  We are in a phase of turnaround but it's going to take some time,  Ekholm said on Tuesday, repeating the firm was on course to double 2016 margins after 2018. Operating loss in the second quarter was 1.2 billion Swedish crowns ($145.3 million), compared with a 2.8 billion profit a year earlier and a mean forecast for a 244 million crown loss seen in a Reuters poll of analysts. Ekholm's strategy to stabilize the business includes exploring options for its loss-making media arm and reviewing unprofitable managed services and network rollout contracts.  We see a more challenging investment environment in Europe and Latin America, that's clearly the market area with the biggest impact,  Ekholm added.  We see macro economic uncertainty in Middle East and Africa that is hurting investment. We see also that operators have funneled the investments more into fiber investments for example than into radio capacity.  The company, backed by prominent Wallenberg family-backed Investor AB and Industrivarden, said it was targeting cost cutting to achieve an annual run rate reduction of at least 10 billion crowns by mid-2018. The exterior of an Ericsson building is seen in Stockholm April 30, 2009.Bob Strong/File PhotoMarket Decline Ericsson stunned investors earlier this year by announcing $1.7 billion in provisions, writedowns and restructuring costs. Moody's cut the company's credit rating to junk in May, partly due to worries that the cost-cutting could hamper innovation. Adding to the sense of gloom, Ericsson said it now sees the mobile infrastructure market falling by a high single-digit percentage this year, compared to its earlier guidance of a 2-6 percent decline.  Ericsson doesn't deliver, they lose versus the market and the market is weak,  said Inge Heydorn, fund manager at Sentat Asset Management, which has no position in Ericsson shares. In 2018 it expects the mobile infrastructure market to fall by a low single digit percentage and to flatten out in 2019, CFO Carl Mellander told Reuters. Sales at Ericsson, one of the top global mobile networks equipment makers, were 49.9 billion crowns below a consensus forecast of 50.5 billion, while the gross margin came in at 27.9 percent versus the 28.4 percent seen by analysts. Operating profit in the Networks segment almost halved to 2.6 billion crowns in the second quarter, while both IT & Cloud and the media segments posted higher losses versus a year ago. It had a net cash position of 24 billion crowns by the end of June, down from 28 billion at the end of March.

Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel said the transparent open canopy made him feel dizzy when it was tested briefly, and for the first time on track, at Silverstone last Friday in British Grand Prix practice. The German also said forward vision was not very good, with some distortion from the curvature of the screen, and he felt his helmet being pushed forward on the straights.   Based on the comments that I've read from Sebastian, it didn't sound to be too popular,  Horner told reporters after Sunday's race.  It feels immature in its concept at the moment to introduce for next year. I'm sure it will be discussed in the strategy group on Wednesday.  The  shield  is designed to protect the driver's head from flying debris and had emerged as the governing body's favored choice after previous trials of a  halo  concept whose looks drew criticism. Force India deputy principal Bob Fernley, who will attend Wednesday's meeting in Geneva, said the technical regulations for 2018 already provided for either the halo or the shield.  We're committed to do something, it's just a question of which direction we decide to go down,  he told Reuters on Tuesday.  That's for discussion tomorrow.   The best solution would probably be to build in the mountings for the shield and continue to work on it and introduce it as and when it is perfected,  added Fernley.  We've just got to make a decision on which one we're going to evaluate fully.  While the shield might be better at deflecting minor components and debris, the less aesthetically pleasing halo could offer greater protection against bouncing wheels and heavier objects. A meeting of the Strategy Group in April decided to give priority to the shield. Decisions made by the group have to be approved by the FIA's World Motor Sport Council but that is usually a formality. Promotional Duties The meeting is also expected to discuss future aerodynamic regulations, the race weekend timetable and an obligation on drivers to attend a number of promotional events, such as a recent one in London. Vettel was asked about that on Sunday and sounded non-committal.  Without getting too political, we have contracts with the team and not with the commercial rights holder,  he said.

Not so, according to a study of the world's foreign exchange markets by Roel Oomen, global co-head of electronic FX spot trading at Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE), one of the world's top FX trading banks.  Instead, adding more liquidity providers or traders to a platform is ultimately counterproductive for clients, he said in an interview.  Banks' share of the foreign exchange market -- the world's biggest financial market, with more than $5 trillion changing hands daily -- has fallen in recent years as trading platforms have proliferated. New technology has made it easier for institutional players and retail punters alike to trade at prices previously only available to the major banks. It is now possible, for example, to get the best prices from multiple players in a single order book, a process known as aggregation.  While some of the world's biggest banks have their own trading platforms for clients, such as Citibank's Velocity, they also offer liquidity on some external trading platforms. But Oomen's study found that adding more than a certain number of liquidity providers to a platform is unlikely to benefit the client and can result in worse pricing over time.   This is because it appears to increase the probability of 'winner's curse', where dealers end up losing money on deals because they have to submit overly aggressive pricing to win transactions,  he said.  They subsequently gave less competitive prices than they might ordinarily have offered to shield themselves from future potential losses, leading to a drop in liquidity.       The study has implications for trading and hedging strategies used by companies and large funds, which increasingly use such technology offered by banks and non-bank participants.  The top five banks' share of FX trading fell to less than half in 2016 from a peak of 60 percent in 2013, according to the latest triennial survey of the market, published by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) last year. That reflects lower participation by big hedge funds as currency volatility has declined, hitting banks which trade on their behalf.  The difficulty of generating a steady income over long periods from carry trades, in which an investor borrows in a low-yielding currency to buy a higher yielding one, while interest rates are low has also sapped trading appetite. Daily volumes on non-bank trading platforms such as XTX Markets, Virtu Financial (VIRT.O) and Citadel Securities can nowadays run into billions of dollars, according to BIS analysts.

Britain's statistics chief said last month he would stop giving government officials early access to sensitive economic figures ahead of publication, reducing from July 1 how widely the figures are disseminated confidentially before publication. While the Office for National Statistics says this move was not in response to queries about leaks into the marketplace, it followed reports by Reuters and the Wall Street Journal that showed unusual pre-release trading patterns in the pound that often correctly anticipated the subsequent price direction.  After rising to a 10-month high of $1.3126 half an hour before the data, sterling sank just over half a cent in the minutes before the 0830 GMT release and almost another half-cent immediately afterwards. The ONS said it did not comment on market rumours. Traders and analysts were quick to point to the currency moves as raising fresh question marks over whether the official numbers were being kept confidential.  Given the suspicions that ONS data was being leaked to the market it is worrying to see another correct move just before the release,  said David Woolcock, Chair of the Committee for Professionalism at ACI the Financial Markets Association, a body representing foreign exchange dealers.  The measures taken by the ONS may possibly have been insufficient.  Several market participants contacted by Reuters, all of whom spoke on condition of anonymity after the data, raised concerns about the moves but also said there were other possible reasons that owed more to re-positioning of the marketplace.  The pound had been lifted sharply against the dollar ahead of Tuesday's figures by an overnight drop in the greenback, even as some major currency dealing banks such as Barclays had below-consensus forecasts for the upcoming inflation release.  You've got to put it in the context of where we are - a 10-month high in cable before the data and inflation already its highest in four years. It makes perfect sense for sterling to soften a little bit given those factors,  said Michael Hewson, chief analyst with CMC Markets in London.   The new ONS methodology came into effect on July 1 and it's only July 18. If it's still happening in a few months time then they may need to have another look at it.

Alcon sales rose 1 percent to $1.5 billion, including intraocular lenses sales that grew for the first time in the second quarter since 2014. Spending to promote products with eye surgeons resulted in a $19 million operating loss. Novartis has been reviewing the future ownership of Alcon, with an update slated for this year. All options are under consideration, Jimenez said on Tuesday, including a possible IPO that he has suggested could value Alcon at $25 billion to $35 billion.   It just increases the options we have,  Jimenez told reporters on a call.  It makes a capital markets exit a possibility, because you've got a growing business with presumably over time margins that are going to grow.  The shares traded 0.5 percent higher at 1400 GMT. Novartis lifted Alcon's full-year sales outlook slightly and now expects revenue to rise by a low single-digit percentage rate. It previously forecast revenue to remain stable or to rise by a low-single digit percentage.  Although Alcon profits continued to decline, this is now moderating and showing signs that the company have it under control,  Deutsche Bank analyst Tim Race said. For all of Novartis, second-quarter core net income fell 2 percent to $2.87 billion, but beat the average analyst forecast of $2.668 billion in a Reuters poll. Sales fell 2 percent to $12.242 billion, hurt by declining revenue from blood cancer drug Gleevec. Jimenez underscored plans to return Novartis to growth in 2018, as newer drugs including heart failure medicine Entresto, psoriasis treatment Cosentyx and breast cancer medicine Kisqali make up for generic competition now eating into Gleevec sales. Cosentyx sales rose 90 percent to $490 million, while Entresto more than doubled to $110 million and remained on track to hit $500 million in 2017. Even so, U.S. pricing headwinds are working against Novartis's Sandoz generics division, whose sales fell 5 percent to $2.5 billion. Fierce competition will continue, Jimenez said, predicting further price erosion.  Sandoz was soft,  Bernstein analyst Timothy Anderson said.  Volume growth was anemic, and overwhelmed by steady price erosion.  Doj, Sec Subpoena Analysts now hope Sandoz's launch of biosimilars - knockoff versions of Roche's (ROG.S) blockbuster Rituxan and Amgen's (AMGN.O) Enbrel won approval in June - will help but Jimenez tempered expectations. He remains uncertain how quickly these cheaper drugs will poach patients from name-brand rivals.  We really don't know yet what the market reaction will be,  he said.  This will be a slow burn, you shouldn't see a big spike in it...but nice steady growth.  Scrutiny continues over business practices at Novartis, which was fined $49 million over kickbacks in South Korea this year. In the second quarter, Alcon was hit with a subpoena by the U.S. Department of Justice and Securities and Exchange Commission regarding activities in Russia and Asia.  It had to do with sales practices,  Jimenez said.  We had done an investigation a couple of years ago, based on some aggressive sales practices, we took action in terms of changing certain leaders in that part of the world. We're cooperating fully with the investigation, and we're able to show them what we found.

Volkswagen's (VOWG_p.DE) cheating on diesel emissions tests has cast a shadow over its Porsche division and the sports car brand, which first introduced diesel in its Cayenne sports utility vehicle (SUV) in 2009, is considering its options.  Of course we are looking into this issue,  CEO Blume said in an interview at the Nuerburgring motorsports complex in western Germany.  We have not made a decision on it.  Blume said Porsche would offer a mix of combustion engines, plug-in hybrid vehicles and purely battery-powered cars over the next 10-15 years and would decide at the end of the decade whether diesel had a future at Porsche. German prosecutors last month started investigating Porsche staff to see whether they were involved in designing illicit engine-control software and regulators are examining whether the Cayenne was fitted with such a device. A redesign of the Cayenne will be launched in September and it will still offer a diesel version, Blume said, just like the Panamera saloon that hit dealerships last November.  For the generations that will follow there are different scenarios,  Blume said. One scenario has Porsche backing out of diesel altogether, sources at the carmaker said. Stuttgart-based Porsche still relies on diesels, which account for about 15 percent of its global sales, to help it bring down emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) as they are more fuel-efficient than petrol engines. At luxury rival BMW (BMWG.DE), diesel cars make up 35 percent of new registrations while Audi's (NSUG.DE) European diesel sales alone account for two-thirds of deliveries. Electric Cities  FILE PHOTO: A Porsche Cayenne Diesel is displayed during the first media day of the 79th Geneva Car Show at the Palexpo in Geneva March 3, 2009.Denis Balibouse/File PhotoBut diesel's image has been badly tarnished by the emissions scandal and revelations that some engines pump dangerously high levels of poisonous nitrogen oxides into the air, prompting many carmakers to review their strategies. To tap into growing demand for electric cars, Porsche is spending a billion euros ($1.2 billion) to overhaul its main Stuttgart plant and build its first battery-only model - the four-door Mission E saloon which is due on the market in 2019. Battery-only vehicles could account for a quarter of Porsche's sales by 2025, give or take 5 to 10 percentage points, Blume said, contradicting a media report that said up to half of its output by 2023-24 could be electric. Slideshow (5 Images)Earlier this month, Geely's GEELY.UL Volvo said all its cars launched after 2019 would be electric or hybrids, making it the first major traditional carmaker to set a date for phasing out vehicles power solely by combustion engines. Porsche and Audi, which together contribute 60 percent of VW's profits, are targeting  significant savings  in development and material costs for their electric-car programs by sharing a new production platform code-named PPE, Blume said. The new architecture will allow both brands to save money by sharing components and modules, helping Porsche with a goal of keeping its return on sales at about 15 percent a year, he said.  Further platforms are conceivable, for instance with SUVs.   Porsche sales rose 6 percent to a record 238,000 cars in 2016 and Blume said the carmaker had a guideline for increasing its sales about 5 percent per year through 2025. Counting on growing demand for high-end electric cars, Porsche may spawn another zero-emission model off the Mission E platform, for which it plans an initial capacity of about 20,000 cars at its Zuffenhausen factory, Blume said. An electrified version of the top-selling Macan SUV is also possible.  We expect the metropolises in China and Asia will switch to pure electric mobility very fast,  the CEO said.  I believe there will be few pure combustion engines to be seen in the large cities there in five years time. The development in rural areas will, however, proceed much more slowly.

International subscriber count increased 8.6 percent to 52.03 million at the end of the June quarter, eclipsing domestic customer numbers of 51.92 million, Netflix said on Monday. The company's shares jumped as much as 9.7 percent to a record high of $177.44 on Tuesday, on track to add roughly $7 billion to Netflix's $70 billion market value. Betting on original shows puts Netflix in pole position to win over more millennials who are shunning traditional television, analysts said. Netflix has a new-found ally as well: pay-TV platforms. Several companies such as Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O), Virgin Media in UK, and Altice in France are bundling Netflix into their pay-TV offerings, which could rapidly ramp up viewer numbers in younger markets, Morgan Stanley analysts wrote. At least 17 brokerages raised their price targets on Netflix. Morgan Stanley and JP Morgan were the most bullish, each raising their target to $210. The median price target is $192.50.  We believe the rapidly growing content offering led by originals, that in aggregate garnered 91 Emmy nominations last week, drove the stronger new sign-ups,  Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a research note. This year, original TV shows including  Stranger Things ,  The Crown  and the latest season of Kevin Spacey-starrer  House of Cards  brought in more customers than Netflix had predicted for the second quarter. Netflix has a long way to go to get more content to please more members, Hastings said on a conference call on Monday, adding that positive returns made him comfortable that the company should continue to invest in original shows. The company has often been criticized for spending too much on content. It said earlier it planned to spend about $6 billion this year for original shows and expected to have negative free cash flow of $2 billion to $2.5 billion. While most analysts backed the company's strategy favoring scale over profit, a few disagreed.  We think that Netflix is destined to be a cash burning high growth company until it changes its strategy and accepts its fate as a highly profitable slow growth company,  said Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter, a long-time critic of the company. He has an  underperform  rating and a $82 price target.

Not so, according to a study of the world's foreign exchange markets by Roel Oomen, global co-head of electronic FX spot trading at Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE), one of the world's top FX trading banks.  Instead, adding more liquidity providers or traders to a platform is ultimately counterproductive for clients, he said in an interview.  Banks' share of the foreign exchange market -- the world's biggest financial market, with more than $5 trillion changing hands daily -- has fallen in recent years as trading platforms have proliferated. New technology has made it easier for institutional players and retail punters alike to trade at prices previously only available to the major banks.

They subsequently gave less competitive prices than they might ordinarily have offered to shield themselves from future potential losses, leading to a drop in liquidity.       The study has implications for trading and hedging strategies used by companies and large funds, which increasingly use such technology offered by banks and non-bank participants.  The top five banks' share of FX trading fell to less than half in 2016 from a peak of 60 percent in 2013, according to the latest triennial survey of the market, published by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) last year. That reflects lower participation by big hedge funds as currency volatility has declined, hitting banks which trade on their behalf.  The difficulty of generating a steady income over long periods from carry trades, in which an investor borrows in a low-yielding currency to buy a higher yielding one, while interest rates are low has also sapped trading appetite. Daily volumes on non-bank trading platforms such as XTX Markets, Virtu Financial (VIRT.O) and Citadel Securities can nowadays run into billions of dollars, according to BIS analysts.

Anderson,US,NOVARTIS,RESULTS,Results Forecasts / Warnings,Chemicals (Legacy),Performance / Results / Earnings,Switzerland,Company News,Western Europe,Corporate Events,Biotechnology and Medical Research (TRBC),Europe,Healthcare (TRBC),Generic and Specialty Pharmaceuticals (TRBC),United States","sector":"News - Housing","content":"ZURICH (Reuters) - Sales growth at Alcon, Novartis's (NOVN.S) struggling eye care unit, accelerated in the second quarter, boosting options for the business including a possible sale, Chief Executive Joe Jimenez said on Tuesday. Alcon sales rose 1 percent to $1.5 billion, including intraocular lenses sales that grew for the first time in the second quarter since 2014. Spending to promote products with eye surgeons resulted in a $19 million operating loss. Novartis has been reviewing the future ownership of Alcon, with an update slated for this year. All options are under consideration, Jimenez said on Tuesday, including a possible IPO that he has suggested could value Alcon at $25 billion to $35 billion.   It just increases the options we have,  Jimenez told reporters on a call.  It makes a capital markets exit a possibility, because you've got a growing business with presumably over time margins that are going to grow.  The shares traded 0.5 percent higher at 1400 GMT. Novartis lifted Alcon's full-year sales outlook slightly and now expects revenue to rise by a low single-digit percentage rate. It previously forecast revenue to remain stable or to rise by a low-single digit percentage.  Although Alcon profits continued to decline, this is now moderating and showing signs that the company have it under control,  Deutsche Bank analyst Tim Race said. For all of Novartis, second-quarter core net income fell 2 percent to $2.87 billion, but beat the average analyst forecast of $2.668 billion in a Reuters poll. Sales fell 2 percent to $12.242 billion, hurt by declining revenue from blood cancer drug Gleevec. Jimenez underscored plans to return Novartis to growth in 2018, as newer drugs including heart failure medicine Entresto, psoriasis treatment Cosentyx and breast cancer medicine Kisqali make up for generic competition now eating into Gleevec sales. Cosentyx sales rose 90 percent to $490 million, while Entresto more than doubled to $110 million and remained on track to hit $500 million in 2017. Even so, U.S. pricing headwinds are working against Novartis's Sandoz generics division, whose sales fell 5 percent to $2.5 billion. Fierce competition will continue, Jimenez said, predicting further price erosion.  Sandoz was soft,  Bernstein analyst Timothy Anderson said.  Volume growth was anemic, and overwhelmed by steady price erosion.  Doj, Sec Subpoena Analysts now hope Sandoz's launch of biosimilars - knockoff versions of Roche's (ROG.S) blockbuster Rituxan and Amgen's (AMGN.O) Enbrel won approval in June - will help but Jimenez tempered expectations. He remains uncertain how quickly these cheaper drugs will poach patients from name-brand rivals.  We really don't know yet what the market reaction will be,  he said.  This will be a slow burn, you shouldn't see a big spike in it...but nice steady growth.  Scrutiny continues over business practices at Novartis, which was fined $49 million over kickbacks in South Korea this year. In the second quarter, Alcon was hit with a subpoena by the U.S. Department of Justice and Securities and Exchange Commission regarding activities in Russia and Asia.  It had to do with sales practices,  Jimenez said.  We had done an investigation a couple of years ago, based on some aggressive sales practices, we took action in terms of changing certain leaders in that part of the world. We're cooperating fully with the investigation, and we're able to show them what we found.

The vote, which is subject to approval by the U.S. National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), would take place on Aug. 3 and 4 at Nissan's Canton, Mississippi, plant, involving at least 4,000 production and skilled trade workers. In a release announcing the agreement, the UAW said that in the days after the union filed a July 11 petition with the NLRB,  Nissan employees have reported widespread pressure by company supervisors in one-on-one meetings and in videos broadcast inside the Canton plant.  UAW Secretary-Treasurer Gary Casteel said in the statement that Nissan is  running one of the most aggressive anti-worker campaigns that we’ve seen in modern U.S. history.  Nissan said in its own statement that it does not believe UAW representation is  is in the best interest  of the plant and its workers.  Our success has been built upon the direct relationship we have with employees,  said Rodney Francis, human resources director at Nissan's Canton plant.  Given the UAW’s history of strikes, layoffs and plant closures, it is clear that their presence could be harmful.  Francis added that Nissan technicians  enjoy pay and benefits that are among the best in Mississippi.  The UAW's representation is largely focused in northern U.S. states. The last major vote on union representation in the South was at Volkswagen AG's plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee, in 2014. That vote failed, but the union was able to get a toehold in the plant in late 2015 when around 165 skilled trades workers voted to become the first members of UAW Local 42. But that toehold is tenuous, as the German automaker has refused to acknowledge the result, arguing against allowing a small group within the plant to have union representation and saying that all 1,500 hourly workers should be treated as one unit.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/autos-nissan-uaw-idUSL1N1K90PL"},

International subscriber count increased 8.6 percent to 52.03 million at the end of the June quarter, eclipsing domestic customer numbers of 51.92 million, Netflix said on Monday. The company's shares jumped as much as 9.7 percent to a record high of $177.44 on Tuesday, on track to add roughly $7 billion to Netflix's $70 billion market value. Betting on original shows puts Netflix in pole position to win over more millennials who are shunning traditional television, analysts said. Netflix has a new-found ally as well: pay-TV platforms. Several companies such as Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O), Virgin Media in UK, and Altice in France are bundling Netflix into their pay-TV offerings, which could rapidly ramp up viewer numbers in younger markets, Morgan Stanley analysts wrote. At least 17 brokerages raised their price targets on Netflix. Morgan Stanley and JP Morgan were the most bullish, each raising their target to $210. The median price target is $192.50.  We believe the rapidly growing content offering led by originals, that in aggregate garnered 91 Emmy nominations last week, drove the stronger new sign-ups,  Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a research note. This year, original TV shows including  Stranger Things ,  The Crown  and the latest season of Kevin Spacey-starrer  House of Cards  brought in more customers than Netflix had predicted for the second quarter. Netflix has a long way to go to get more content to please more members, Hastings said on a conference call on Monday, adding that positive returns made him comfortable that the company should continue to invest in original shows. The company has often been criticized for spending too much on content. It said earlier it planned to spend about $6 billion this year for original shows and expected to have negative free cash flow of $2 billion to $2.5 billion. While most analysts backed the company's strategy favoring scale over profit, a few disagreed.  We think that Netflix is destined to be a cash burning high growth company until it changes its strategy and accepts its fate as a highly profitable slow growth company,  said Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter, a long-time critic of the company. He has an  underperform  rating and a $82 price target.

The survey, which polled 207 asset managers with $586 billion under management, was carried out between July 7 and 13, and showed investors rotating out of technology stocks, which 68 percent of poll participants said were  expensive . Since the 2009 market lows, tech stocks have been the most overweight sector in portfolios 80 percent of the time, but investors have grown uneasy about the valuations. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite was again picked as the  most crowded  trade, with 38 percent of poll respondents nominating this, the same as last month.   The Nasdaq sold off sharply in June, losing almost 2 percent in the final week, but has rebounded since and is trading back near its previous highs. Cash levels fell to 4.9 percent from last month's 5 percent, but remain above the 4.5 percent 10-year average.  Some 25 percent of investors who are holding higher cash levels are doing so because of their bearish views on markets, the poll indicated. Expectations that global growth would accelerate fell to 38 percent in July, down from 62 percent in January.  Investors were also concerned about a crash in global bond markets, with 28 percent choosing this as their top tail risk, just ahead of a policy mistake by the U.S. Federal Reserve or European Central Bank, chosen by 27 percent. Last week, Fed chair Janet Yellen indicated that U.S. rate hikes could be gradual, and weak inflation data on Friday appeared to sharply reduce the chances of a third rate rise this year. Meanwhile, the European Central Bank (ECB) is keen to keep its asset purchases open-ended rather than setting a potentially distant date on which bond-buying will stop, to retain flexibility in case the outlook sours. BAML said the ECB was the most likely central bank to spark a global  risk off  trade, with euro zone exposure high relative to BAML's global fund manager survey history.

In the consumer division, Bank of America managed to increase deposits at a lower cost and use those cheaper funds to fuel loan growth. That business posted profits higher than any other unit, and contributed more to the bottom line. Overall, Bank of America hit a target of spending 60 cents for every dollar of revenue it produces, down from 63 cents a year earlier. Investors have been watching that metric closely as a sign of how efficiently the bank is run. Bank of America, the second-largest U.S. lender by assets, is working to reduce annual operating expenses to $53 billion next year.  This was a good quarter all around for BofA,  said Evercore ISI analyst Glenn Schorr.  You really have to look hard to find a few issues to talk about.  Chief Executive Officer Brian Moynihan and Chief Financial Officer Paul Donofrio both characterized the second quarter as one of the best in the bank's history.  These results tell us that responsible growth is working,  Donofrio said in a call with journalists on Tuesday. Bank of America delivered net income of $4.9 billion, or 46 cents per share, up 11 percent from the year-ago period. Analysts had been expecting 43 cents, on average, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The bank's total revenue of $23.07 billion also beat the average analyst estimate of $21.78 billion. Its shares were slightly down at $23.98 in premarket trading, following a 8.4 percent year-to-date rise through Monday's close. Even as big banks have reported better results, investors have been disappointed that profits are not growing faster. Last week, shares of JPMorgan Chase & Co, Wells Fargo & Co and Citigroup Inc each fell after beating analysts' estimates, as did Goldman Sachs Group Inc on Tuesday. Gains across Bank of America's businesses were broad, but particularly in its consumer bank. The business reported loan growth across residential mortgages, credit cards and autos compared with the year-ago quarter. Even as interest rates rose during the quarter following a rate hike from the U.S. Federal Reserve, Bank of America managed to lure an additional $17 billion in deposits while paying less to attract those funds. Analysts consider Bank of America the most interest-rate sensitive among big U.S. banks because of the way its balance sheet is constructed in terms of loan maturities, types of funding and hedges. Its net interest income, which measures the difference between its cost of funding and the income it generates from those funds, rose 8.6 percent to $10.99 billion in the second quarter. Apart from its global markets unit, which suffered a downturn in trading like other Wall Street banks, Bank of America's other business lines also produced higher profits. Wealth and investment management reported record net income of $804 million, and a record pretax profit margin of 28 percent. Both the wealth business and retail brokerage, which sits inside the consumer business, attracted more assets. Global banking also earned more money, with growth in corporate and commercial loans, more revenue from transaction services and higher investment banking fees related to those customers. Non-interest expenses rose 1.7 percent, partly due to charges related to closing data centers. But the bank still managed to hit Moynihan's efficiency target and produced 5 percentage points of  operating leverage,  which measures how well a company can maintain revenue while cutting costs.

The move would be part of a wider plan to promote EU public and private spending on clean energy and other green industries. The European Commission estimates that Europe will need 180 billion euros ($207 billion) in additional investment every year in the next two decades if it wants to achieve its goal of curbing global warming. Clearer classification and common labels for green financial products are expected to boost environment-friendly markets and help curb  greenwashing , a practice whereby companies and other organizations claim to be  greener  than they really are. The EU Commission's vice president Valdis Dombrovskis said the decision of President Donald Trump to pull the United States out of the 2015 Paris global accord on fighting climate change would create new opportunities for Europe.  (Improved labelling) will provide the confidence and trust in sustainable and green products needed for investors to fund the transition to the low-carbon economy,  he told a conference on Tuesday. The Commission will make proposals early next year on how to foster financial markets' shift towards greener products, he added.  The European Investment Bank, the EU's financial arm, has pledged to maintain a target of investing around 20 billion dollars a year to fight climate change over the next five years, which would make it the largest contributor among multilateral institutions. But private funding is also crucial to boost the sector. The lack of commonly agreed labels and standards for green financial products has so far hampered market development, according to a report prepared by an EU expert group on sustainable finance. Green funds had around €145 billion of assets under management in 2016, against €3.1 trillion invested in European bonds and €3.4 trillion in equity funds, the report said. Classification in green bonds is predicted to nearly double its global value to 131 billion euros this year, Dombrovskis sad, despite the continued absence of a European standard for such products which could further fuel their expansion. The expert group's report said clearer definitions of green credentials should also be used for equity funds and other assets to favor investors' decisions and match global targets to reduce climate change.  The group will present by the end of the year a more comprehensive assessment of the regulatory changes needed at EU level to boost sustainable finance.

The trial, which puts on public display the challenges Pope Francis faces in trying to clean up the Vatican, began with the court rejecting a defense motion to dismiss, as well as a request to bar journalists. Giuseppe Profiti and Massimo Spina, respectively the former president and treasurer of the Bambino Gesu hospital in Rome, are charged with spending 422,000 euros ($481,000) in 2013 and 2014 on refurbishing the large Vatican apartment of Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, the Vatican's former number two. The trial was adjourned until Sept. 7, and the court left open the possibility that Bertone, who was not indicted, might be called as a witness.  His retirement apartment, which has a huge terrace and breath-taking view of the dome of St. Peter's Basilica, has become a symbol of the frugal-minded pope's efforts to rein in the luxury some Church leaders still enjoy. Bertone, 82, was the Vatican secretary of state, effectively the deputy pope, for most of the pontificate of former Pope Benedict and was one of the most powerful men in the Roman Catholic Church. He was removed from office in 2013, eight months after the election of Francis. The renovation started a few weeks later on the spacious property, which is next door to the Vatican guest house where the pope lives in a modest suite. At the trial's start in the Vatican's tiny courtroom in a building just a stone's throw from the both the apartment and the pope's residence, lawyers for the defense asked that journalists be barred from future hearings. One, Antonello Blasi, said journalists would disturb the hearings and that their  gestures of disapproval  could influence the three-judge panel.  Breathing Down Our Backs  The trial is being covered by a rotating pool of eight journalists who then report back to their colleagues.  Chief prosecutor Gian Piero Milano, ridiculed another defense lawyer who said he felt the journalists were  breathing down our backs . Milano said:  I am sorry that you have no 'safety distance' from the journalists.  The judges rejected the request that journalists watch via a video link in an adjacent room, saying the trial was in the public interest. They also rejected two defense requests to declare that the Vatican court had no jurisdiction over the accused because the hospital they ran is in Italy and because the money paid to an Italian construction company to finance the renovation was first sent to an affiliate in London. The Bambino Gesu, considered one of Italy's best pediatric hospitals, is in Rome but has extra-territorial status as part of the Vatican, a sovereign state. It was founded by a wealthy Italian family in 1869 and donated to the Vatican in 1924. Profiti and Spina risk prison sentences of three to five years if convicted, under Vatican laws on conspiracy to commit a crime and misappropriation of funds. When the Vatican confirmed last year that Profiti and Spina were under investigation, a lawyer for Bertone said the cardinal had never asked for or authorized payment for the restoration work from hospital funds. Profiti has said the hospital used its funds to renovate Bertone's apartment because the cardinal had agreed that it could be used for fundraising. Hospital officials said at the time that Bertone had given 150,000 euros of his own money to Bambino Gesu to make amends for damage done to the hospital's image.

Michael Makuei, who is also the information minister, said the army would be given powers to stop the fighting in Gogrial state, and that citizens' rights would be suspended, though the presidency has not announced which rights will be curtailed. Local media said dozens of people had been killed in the fighting in the state in the country's north, though Reuters could not independently verify the number of those killed. Makuei said the state of emergency also applied to the neighboring areas of Tonj, Wau, and Aweil East. Wau has experienced fighting this year between government forces and rebels under former vice president Riek Machar, an ethnic Nuer, who is waging an insurgency in much of the country. South Sudan descended into civil war in December 2013, largely between soldiers and militia from the Dinka and Nuer ethnic groups. The war has killed tens of thousands of people and displaced nearly 4 million people from their homes. The clashes in Gogrial have been between militiamen from the Apuk and Aguok clans of the Dinka group, which Kiir belongs to.  The president declared a state of emergency in order to bring this situation under control,  Makuei told Reuters by telephone.  These are tribal fights which are connected to issues of land, grazing areas,  Makuei said. Separately, 36 people were killed over the weekend in an attack on a village near Bor town in the Dinka-dominated central Jonglei state, the United Nations said Tuesday.  The United Nations said its peacekeepers were treating some of the 24 people injured in the attack. Makuei, who is from Bor, blamed militia from the Murle tribe from neighboring Boma state for committing the attack and stealing thousands of cattle. Bor Dinka and Murle militia clashed earlier this year before signing a cessation of hostilities in May. The minister said the Boma governor was summoned to a security council meeting and directed to apprehend those responsible for the attack. Deadly cattle raids are common in South Sudan, an impoverished country awash in automatic weapons where livestock are used as money.

Spot gold        was up 0.5 percent at $1,240.51 an ounce at 1346 GMT, having touched $1,242.52, its highest since July 3. U.S. gold futures         rose 0.2 percent to $1,239.80.     The dollar sank to a 10-month low against a basket of currencies, making dollar-denominated metals cheaper for holders of other currencies, which could boost demand.             We see gold averaging around $1,300 over the third quarter,  said ING commodities strategist Warren Patterson.       Indian imports are rising after the very poor year last year. We expect that trend to continue even with the tax changes.       Data from consultancy GFMS shows India's gold imports climbed to an estimated 75 tonnes in June from 22.7 tonnes a year earlier. For the first half of the year imports rose to 514 tonnes, up 161 percent year on year.                  GFMS analysts said the jump was caused by Indian consumers buying ahead of July's increase in the goods and services tax on gold to 3 percent from 1.2 percent.     Weighing on the dollar is the collapse of U.S. President Donald Trump's efforts to deliver a new healthcare bill in a market deeply worried by the pace of America's economic growth.      The Fed is unlikely to be able to increase rates again soon, possibly not again this year, and it will certainly not rush to reduce its balance sheet,  ICBC Standard Bank analysts said in a note.     However, investors are still retreating from physical gold. Holdings of SPDR Gold Trust      , the world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, slipped to 827.07 tonnes on Monday, down from 828.84 tonnes on Friday.               On the technical front, resistance kicks in at $1,245-$1,247, the 55-day and 100-day moving averages respectively. Those are followed by $1,250, a Fibonacci retracement level. Support is around $1,230, near the 21-day and 200-day moving averages.     Meanwhile the price of silver        gained 1 percent to $16.23 an ounce after touching a two-week high at $16.26.     Platinum        gained 0.4 percent to $925.1 while palladium        slipped by 0.1 percent to $863.7.

Five major U.S. lenders have reported an average 31 percent drop in second-quarter mortgage banking revenue in the past few days, compared with the same quarter of last year. An ongoing decline in refinancing activity, higher funding costs, tougher competition and a greater portion of business coming from third parties, who generally deliver lower margins, all contributed to the slide. Even so, executives sounded optimistic about the core operation of lending to people who want to buy homes.  We continue to see good growth in residential mortgages,  Paul Donofrio, finance chief at Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), said on Tuesday. New mortgages were the primary driver of loan growth in its consumer bank last quarter. However, mortgage banking revenue fell 26 percent because the bank has been keeping more loans on its balance sheet, which generates income over time, rather than selling them to investors for quick fees. At Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), the biggest U.S. home lender, its mortgage banking revenue of $1.4 billion was down 19 percent from the year-ago period. A variety of factors hurt results, including the sale of a legacy portfolio of risky loans, but Wells saw improved credit quality among borrowers, and strong demand for mortgages to purchase new homes. The bank sees  huge opportunities  in growing first and second mortgages, Chief Executive Officer Tim Sloan said.  I wouldn't throw in the towel on the mortgage business,  said Sloan. JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), PNC Financial Services Group Inc (PNC.N), Citigroup Inc (C.N) have also reported mortgage banking revenue declines of 19 percent to 41 percent. Starting in 2009, banks began to benefit from a surge in mortgage refinancing, thanks to rock-bottom interest rates and federal programs to help struggling borrowers. That activity has been trailing off as rates have started to rise and many borrowers who sought lower rates have already gotten fresh loans. It will be difficult to make up for lost refinancing volumes, even though the market for home purchases has been improving, analysts said. New and existing home sales rose in May while prices reached all-time highs, according to federal housing data and the National Association of Realtors (NAR). Weekly mortgage applications shot to a seven-year high at one point during the quarter, according to data from the Mortgage Bankers Association. NAR predicts new single-family home sales will rise 8.4 percent this year. Those improvements in the market may continue for some time, analysts said, since mortgage rates remain low by historical standards and young American millennials have only recently begun to enter the housing market. But banks' mortgage businesses will only show improvements as comparisons with a previous year become easier, they said.  While we saw some pressure in the second quarter, we think that's a low point for the year,  Marty Mosby, an analyst at Vining Sparks brokerage and asset manager, told Reuters.  We should start to see some pickup in home purchase activity.

Investors were also concerned about a crash in global bond markets, with 28 percent choosing this as their top tail risk, just ahead of a policy mistake by the U.S. Federal Reserve or European Central Bank, chosen by 27 percent. Last week, Fed chair Janet Yellen indicated that U.S. rate hikes could be gradual, and weak inflation data on Friday appeared to sharply reduce the chances of a third rate rise this year. Meanwhile, the European Central Bank (ECB) is keen to keep its asset purchases open-ended rather than setting a potentially distant date on which bond-buying will stop, to retain flexibility in case the outlook sours. BAML said the ECB was the most likely central bank to spark a global  risk off  trade, with euro zone exposure high relative to BAML's global fund manager survey history.

Faraday is part of a network of young electric vehicle (EV) firms in China and the United States backed by Jia, whose indebted film production-to-cars conglomerate is facing a severe cash crunch after rapid expansion. Kranz joins as Faraday struggles to support some of its loftier goals, including beating Elon Musk's Tesla Motors in premium EV making. It said last week it would move production of the FF91 to a new site to get the car to production faster, effectively mothballing a stalled $1 billion Las Vegas factory. Faraday said in a statement late on Monday that Kranz would lead all engineering and technology research and development, purchasing and manufacturing improvements -  focused on getting the FF91 to production quickly . At BMW, Kranz led the carmaker's i electric vehicle project, launching vehicle lines including the i8, i3, Z3 and X5. He also worked on the revival of the Mini brand, Faraday said. BMW said Kranz handed over responsibility for developing BMW's  i  vehicles to colleague Robert Irlinger on January 1, 2017. BMW has seen a string of electric vehicle engineers defect to Chinese startup carmakers.  Last year Dirk Abendroth, manager of BMW's  i  powertrain group, Henrik Wenders, vice president product management BMW  i , and Carsten Breitfeld,  head of the i8 vehicle program, were poached by Future Mobility Corp. BMW said defections were not affecting the carmaker's ability to develop more electric vehicles. The engineering team developing its  iNext  vehicle is bigger than ever, a spokesman for the company said on Tuesday.  Stefan Krause, a BMW veteran and now Faraday's global chief financial officer, also was appointed chief operating officer.

Trump,Elaine Chao,Robert Latta,USA,SELFDRIVING/,Americas,United States","sector":"Homepage","content":"WASHINGTON, July 18 (Reuters) - A U.S. House subcommittee will vote on Wednesday on a sweeping proposal to allow automakers to deploy up to 100,000 self-driving vehicles without meeting existing auto safety standards and bar states from imposing driverless car rules. The measure, which would be the first significant federal legislation aimed at speeding self-driving cars to market, would require automakers to submit safety assessment reports to U.S. regulators, but would not require pre-market approval of advanced vehicle technologies. Automakers would have to show self-driving cars  function as intended and contain fail safe features  but the Transportation Department could not  condition deployment or testing of highly automated vehicles on review of safety assessment certifications,  the draft measure unveiled late Monday said. Last month, a U.S. House Energy and Commerce subcommittee held a hearing on a draft plan to allow U.S. regulators to exempt up to 100,000 vehicles a year per manufacturer from federal motor vehicle safety rules that prevent the sale of self-driving vehicles without human controls and bar states from setting rules that could block their use. Automakers must meet nearly 75 auto safety standards, many of which were written with the assumption that a licensed driver will be in control of the vehicle. The 30-page draft bill would also require the Transportation Department within two years to adopt rules requiring automakers to add a driver alert to check rear seating in an effort to prevent children from being left behind and consider setting performance standards for headlights.  This legislation puts important benchmarks into place that will prioritize consumer safety technologies and enhance mobility opportunities for people across the country,  said Republican U.S. Representative Robert Latta, who chairs the panel that will vote on the measure Wednesday. Democrats had sought a number of new safety requirements during negotiations over the measure. The bill also includes automakers to take steps to ensure the cybersecurity of self-driving cars. General Motors Co, Alphabet Inc, Tesla Inc and others have been lobbying Congress to pre-empt rules under consideration in California and other states that could limit self-driving vehicle deployment. States could still set rules on registration, licensing, liability, insurance and safety inspections, but could not set self-driving car performance standards, under the proposal. The administration of former Democratic President Barack Obama last year unveiled voluntary guidelines on self-driving cars that asked automakers to submit a 15-question safety assessment. President Donald Trump's transportation secretary, Elaine Chao, said she plans to update those in the coming months. The issue has taken new urgency after U.S. road deaths rose 7.7 percent in 2015 over the previous year to 35,200, the highest annual jump since 1966. Traffic deaths climbed nearly 8 percent in the first nine months of 2016, government data shows. Automakers also say that without changes in regulations, U.S. self-driving car testing could move to Europe and elsewhere.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-selfdriving-idUSL1N1K90NV"},

Shares of Bank of America slipped 0.8 percent, while Goldman Sachs was down 0.9 percent after reporting quarterly results. Last week, shares of JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Citigroup had taken a beating after their quarterly results and forecasts failed to excite investors. Harley-Davidson slumped 9.6 percent after the motorcycle maker cut its 2017 shipments forecast. The healthcare sector will be under scrutiny after the Republican healthcare bill to replace Obamacare sank in the Senate, with news that two Republican senators would not support the latest version of the bill. The healthcare bill failure spelled uncertainty for President Donald Trump's agenda of tax reform and an infrastructure overhaul, leaving the president without any major legislative accomplishments six months into his tenure. News on the healthcare bill sent the U.S. dollar to a 10-month low against a basket of major currencies.  Investor sentiment is pessimistic this morning,  said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets UK.  The fiasco of the healthcare bill means that the tax reforms or the so called infrastructure spending plan are in jeopardy.  UnitedHealth Group fell 0.2 percent, while Johnson and Johnson fell 0.4 percent. At 9:34 a.m. ET (1334 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 61.69 points, or 0.29 percent, at 21,568.03, the S&P; 500 was down 5.71 points, or 0.23 percent, at 2,453.43. The Nasdaq Composite was down 16.48 points, or 0.26 percent, at 6,297.95. Eight of the 11 major S&P; 500 sectors were lower, with the healthcare index's 0.50 percent fall leading the decliners. As the earnings season gets under way, the market will be keeping a close eye on corporate results to see if the high valuations are justified in the face of mixed economic data, tepid inflation and policy gridlock in Washington. Analysts' are estimating an 8.2 percent rise in second-quarter earnings for the S&P; 500 companies from a year earlier. This follows a robust first quarter when U.S. companies posted their best earnings since 2011, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. IBM, United Continental Holdings, CSX and Navient are among the companies scheduled to report results after the bell. Netflix jumped 8.8 percent after the streaming-television pioneer's added more subscribers than expected in the second quarter. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,552 to 899. On the Nasdaq, 1,596 issues fell and 631 advanced. (Reporting by Tanya Agrawal; Editing by Arun Koyyur)","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-stocks-idUSL3N1K94KQ"},

Villar, his son - named by Spanish media as Gorka - and several other Spanish soccer federation members were detained on allegations of collusion, fraud and embezzlement, the police said in a statement. Spain's High Court said one of its investigating magistrates and anti-corruption prosecutors were leading the investigation.  The RFEF could not be reached for comment.  Villar, a one-time midfielder for Athletic Bilbao, has been at the head of the federation for nearly 30 years.  He was fined 25,000 Swiss francs ($26,000) last year by FIFA's Ethics Committee for failing to co-operate with an investigation into the contest to host the 2018 and 2022 World Cups that triggered the worst crisis in the soccer world governing body's history.

The Advertising Standards Authority, which plays a big role in regulating the industry in Britain, said it would take a harder line against adverts that feature common sexist stereotypes or which mock people who do not adopt typical gender roles.  The crackdown follows a barrage of complaints by British consumers about a 2015 campaign by Protein World for weight loss products which featured a bikini-clad model with the tag line  Are you beach body ready?  The ad, which ran on posters on the London Underground network, is no longer in circulation.  The majority of complaints relate to how women are portrayed, according to ASA research. A major review based on evidence from an independent study showed that some stereotypes could restrict the choices and opportunities of children and adults, the ASA said.   Within the ad framework, a drip-drip feed of many ads featuring gender stereotypes for certain roles for boys and girls narrows people's views in terms of aspirations, what they can do and their role in society,  said ASA senior media relations officer Matt Wilson.   That's what we are trying address in our own specific way.   Previously, the ASA ruled against ads it deemed to promote objectification, inappropriate sexualization or unhealthy body ideals. The new standards will not ban all gender stereotypes, just those that could cause  potential harm.   Adverts simply featuring a woman cleaning or a man doing DIY projects would not be considered problematic. However, an ad featuring a woman as solely responsible for cleaning up a mess made by her family, or a man failing to complete a simple household task, would do, ASA said.  The new regulations will be applied only to future advertisements. ASA said the new standards were being formed now by the Committees and Advertising Practise and were expected to be announced and go into effect in 2018.

In 2016, the company's gold output fell by 9.2 percent to 65,394 ounces, less than targeted. The London-listed firm said copper production at Azerbaijan's Gedabek main mine and the Gosha mine rose to 1,322 tonnes in the first half of this year from 969 tonnes a year earlier. Silver output declined to 85,087 ounces from 90,782 ounces.  Our (gold output) forecast for 2017 remains at between 64,000 ounces and 72,000 ounces whilst we continue our production optimisation programme, providing a very solid platform for us to build on in 2018 and beyond,  Anglo Asian CEO Reza Vaziri said in a statement. Vaziri said  maintaining production during this phase of optimisation is a significant achievement for Anglo Asian and puts us in a strong position as we look to increase production from current levels with the introduction of ore from Ugur in the fourth quarter of 2017.  Anglo Asian started a significant exploration programme at the end of last year after making a new gold discovery at Ugur, three km (1.8 miles) from its Gedabek processing facilities. Gold sales in the second quarter of this year totalled 7,406 ounces at an average price of $1,258 per ounce, down from 8,283 ounces sold in the first quarter at an average of $1,220 per ounce. Gold is produced at Gedabek and other Azeri mines under a production venture with Anglo Asian, in which the government owns 49 percent. Anglo Asian began production at Gedabek, 350 km west of the capital Baku, in July 2009 with plans to extract 22 tonnes of gold. Overall, Anglo Asian plans to exploit seven mines in western Azerbaijan with estimated gold reserves of 430 tonnes.

Central European currencies have gained strength in recent weeks on the back of a softer dollar, which has lost some favour as other major central banks signal they could change monetary policy. The region is trading at more than 2-year highs against the U.S. currency.     The dollar continued to fall, hit by the latest collapse of U.S. President Donald Trump's efforts to deliver a new healthcare bill.     The weaker dollar is helping central European currencies against the euro, the region's main trading pair. The forint  was just off a one-month high against the euro on Tuesday and was bid at 306.69 at 1316 GMT, up 0.1 percent.     The forint showed little reaction to the Hungarian central bank leaving interest rates at record lows on Tuesday. The bank said it was ready to loosen policy if needed.     Analysts have forecast the bank may keep borrowing costs unchanged into 2019.     Capital Economics said, however, it may need to tighten next year.  There is a growing risk that the bank fails to shift its dovish stance, which could cause a nasty inflation shock and prompt more aggressive rate hikes further down the road,  emerging Europe economist Liam Carson said.     Other currencies were mixed, with the Polish zloty up a tad and the Czech crown edging down less than 0.1 percent. The Romanian leu inched up while Bucharest stocks added 0.5 percent on Tuesday, to lead central Europe's gain.     Prague rose on the back of an almost 9 percent jump in Pegas. Czech investment group R2G launched an offer to buy the group, although analysts said the bid might not be high enough.

It was speaking a day after Russia's Supreme Court rejected the religious group's appeal and upheld an April ruling which declared the organization  extremist  and ordered it to disband in Russia.  We plan to appeal this at the European Court of Human Rights as soon as we can,  Yaroslav Sivulskiy, a member of the European Association of Jehovah's Christian Witnesses, said by phone.  All legal avenues inside Russia have been exhausted.  Sivulskiy said the Jehovah's Witnesses strongly disagreed with the court's ruling against it, but had no option but to comply. Religious life in Russia is dominated by the Orthodox Church, which exerts considerable political influence and enjoys the support of President Vladimir Putin. Some Orthodox scholars view Jehovah's Witnesses as a 'totalitarian sect'. A European Union foreign policy spokeswoman said in a statement that the ban had already created serious problems for the group.  This ban has already resulted in cases of criminal prosecutions against Jehovah's Witnesses, as well as police raids on their prayer halls, arson attacks and other forms of harassment,  the spokeswoman said.   Jehovah’s Witnesses, like all other religious groups, must be able to peacefully enjoy freedom of assembly without interference, as guaranteed by the Constitution of the Russian Federation, as well as by Russia's international commitments and international human rights standards.    Prior to the ban, Russian authorities put several of the group's publications on a list of banned extremist literature and prosecutors have long cast it as an organization that destroys families, fosters hatred and threatens lives. The group, a United States-based Christian denomination known for its door-to-door preaching and rejection of military service and blood transfusions, says this description is false. It says it has 175,000 followers in Russia.

Some foreign banks have scaled back new business with Qatar since the four Arab nations cut diplomatic ties with the country and imposed economic sanctions on it on June 5, while state-owned Qatar Investment Authority has placed deposits with some local banks to help ease liquidity. QIB also reported an 8.3 percent rise in second-quarter net profit on Tuesday, according to Reuters calculations, which was in line with analysts' forecasts. But the bank did not comment on the diplomatic crisis in its results statement.  The out-flux may have been related to withdrawal of deposits from other Gulf Cooperation Council countries post the strained diplomatic ties or it may be an usual outflow of deposits, after the bank witnessed a strong 8 billion riyals of inflow in the first quarter,  Chiradeep Ghosh, banking analyst at Bahrain's Securities & Investment Company (SICO), said. QIB is considered one of the banks most dependent on funding from its Gulf neighbours, obtaining 24 percent of its funding and 24 percent of deposits from the rest of the GCC, according to research published last month by Goldman Sachs. Customer deposits at the bank reached 97 billion riyals at the end of June, up 2 percent from the previous year period, but down 6.6 percent from the previous quarter. QIB made a net profit of 609.7 million riyals during the three months to June 30, compared with 562.9 million riyals in the same period a year earlier, Reuters calculated from financial statements in the absence of a quarterly breakdown. Four analysts polled by Reuters had forecast on average a quarterly net profit of 562.8 million riyals. QIB, which in May completed the issue of a $750 million sukuk, posted net profit of 1.17 billion riyals for the six month period, 10 percent higher than the same period a year earlier, according to a bourse statement. Financing activities reached 110 billion riyals at the end of June, up by 13.6 percent from the year earlier period.

The new note follows the introduction last year of a five pound note made from a polymer film, which the central bank says is more durable and harder to forge. The 5 pound note drew criticism from vegetarians and some religious groups for containing trace amounts of animal fats - something which will also be the case for the new 10 pound note. The British central bank is working to find an alternative production method in time for when it launches a new 20 pound note in 2020. Tuesday marks the 200th anniversary of Austen's death. She was buried in Winchester Cathedral in 1817, and completed many of her best-known works such as  Pride and Prejudice  and  Emma  in the village of Chawton, 15 miles away.  Austen's novels have a universal appeal and speak as powerfully today as they did when they were first published,  Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said ahead of the launch event in the cathedral, which dates back to the 7th century. He was likely to face questions from reporters at the launch about the choice of a quotation -  I declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading!  - used on the banknote. The Guardian newspaper said in 2013, when a first version of the design was made public, that the quotation came from a character in  Pride and Prejudice  who in fact had no interest in books and was merely trying to impress a potential suitor. The new 10 pound note includes tactile features to make it easier for blind people to identify, and the BoE says each note should last for around five years, compared to around two years for the current paper note featuring scientist Charles Darwin. The 10 pound notes which feature Darwin will cease to be legal tender during the first half of next year.

Five major U.S. lenders have reported an average 31 percent drop in second-quarter mortgage banking revenue in the past few days, compared with the same quarter of last year. An ongoing decline in refinancing activity, higher funding costs, tougher competition and a greater portion of business coming from third parties, who generally deliver lower margins, all contributed to the slide. Even so, executives sounded optimistic about the core operation of lending to people who want to buy homes.  We continue to see good growth in residential mortgages,  Paul Donofrio, finance chief at Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), said on Tuesday. New mortgages were the primary driver of loan growth in its consumer bank last quarter. However, mortgage banking revenue fell 26 percent because the bank has been keeping more loans on its balance sheet, which generates income over time, rather than selling them to investors for quick fees. At Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), the biggest U.S. home lender, its mortgage banking revenue of $1.4 billion was down 19 percent from the year-ago period. A variety of factors hurt results, including the sale of a legacy portfolio of risky loans, but Wells saw improved credit quality among borrowers, and strong demand for mortgages to purchase new homes. The bank sees  huge opportunities  in growing first and second mortgages, Chief Executive Officer Tim Sloan said.  I wouldn't throw in the towel on the mortgage business,  said Sloan. JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), PNC Financial Services Group Inc (PNC.N), Citigroup Inc (C.N) have also reported mortgage banking revenue declines of 19 percent to 41 percent. Starting in 2009, banks began to benefit from a surge in mortgage refinancing, thanks to rock-bottom interest rates and federal programs to help struggling borrowers. That activity has been trailing off as rates have started to rise and many borrowers who sought lower rates have already gotten fresh loans. It will be difficult to make up for lost refinancing volumes, even though the market for home purchases has been improving, analysts said. New and existing home sales rose in May while prices reached all-time highs, according to federal housing data and the National Association of Realtors (NAR). Weekly mortgage applications shot to a seven-year high at one point during the quarter, according to data from the Mortgage Bankers Association. NAR predicts new single-family home sales will rise 8.4 percent this year. Those improvements in the market may continue for some time, analysts said, since mortgage rates remain low by historical standards and young American millennials have only recently begun to enter the housing market. But banks' mortgage businesses will only show improvements as comparisons with a previous year become easier, they said.  While we saw some pressure in the second quarter, we think that's a low point for the year,  Marty Mosby, an analyst at Vining Sparks brokerage and asset manager, told Reuters.  We should start to see some pickup in home purchase activity.

Faraday is part of a network of young electric vehicle (EV) firms in China and the United States backed by Jia, whose indebted film production-to-cars conglomerate is facing a severe cash crunch after rapid expansion. Kranz joins as Faraday struggles to support some of its loftier goals, including beating Elon Musk's Tesla Motors in premium EV making. It said last week it would move production of the FF91 to a new site to get the car to production faster, effectively mothballing a stalled $1 billion Las Vegas factory. Faraday said in a statement late on Monday that Kranz would lead all engineering and technology research and development, purchasing and manufacturing improvements -  focused on getting the FF91 to production quickly . At BMW, Kranz led the carmaker's i electric vehicle project, launching vehicle lines including the i8, i3, Z3 and X5. He also worked on the revival of the Mini brand, Faraday said. BMW said Kranz handed over responsibility for developing BMW's  i  vehicles to colleague Robert Irlinger on January 1, 2017. BMW has seen a string of electric vehicle engineers defect to Chinese startup carmakers.  Last year Dirk Abendroth, manager of BMW's  i  powertrain group, Henrik Wenders, vice president product management BMW  i , and Carsten Breitfeld,  head of the i8 vehicle program, were poached by Future Mobility Corp. BMW said defections were not affecting the carmaker's ability to develop more electric vehicles. The engineering team developing its  iNext  vehicle is bigger than ever, a spokesman for the company said on Tuesday.  Stefan Krause, a BMW veteran and now Faraday's global chief financial officer, also was appointed chief operating officer.

The bank flagged possible further loosening in monetary conditions with unconventional tools, saying inflation would reach its target in a sustainable way only in early 2019. It said rising wages in the economy have not posed any upward pressure to inflation so far.  If inflation remains persistently below the target, the Council will stand ready to ease monetary conditions further using unconventional, targeted instruments,  the rate-setting Monetary Council said in a statement. Benign inflation could allow the National Bank of Hungary (NBH) -- central Europe's most dovish central bank -- to keep the base rate at its record low of 0.9 percent through to 2019, a Reuters poll of analysts showed last week. With the bank ruling out further cuts in the main policy rate, reducing the stock of its three-month deposits and pumping liquidity into markets via forex swaps have emerged as its key tools to curb market rates. They have allowed the bank, led by a strong ally of Prime Minister Viktor Orban, to make loans cheaper for businesses and households, while keeping growth at around 4 percent is a cornerstone of Orban's campaign for parliamentary elections due in April 2018. Even though hawkish remarks from European Central Bank President Mario Draghi have driven up Hungary's long-term government bond yields in the past two weeks, the NBH is expected to remain dovish. The central bank said last month it would lower its cap on three-month deposits to 300 billion forints from 500 billion by the end of September. Analysts have said further cuts in the cap -- with a view to easing monetary conditions by boosting liquidity -- were expected by the end of this year. Annual headline inflation slowed to 1.9 percent in June from 2.1 percent in May. The bank's 3 percent target has a one percentage point tolerance on either side. Gergely Urmossy, an analyst at Erste Bank said the bank's communication after the rate decision was in line with expectations.  The Council's message confirmed our interest rate forecast, so we do not expect a change in the 0.9 percent base rate until the end of 2019,  Urmossy said. The forint traded at 306.69 versus the euro at 1323 GMT, a shade weaker from 306.25 before the rate announcement.

The U.S. dollar        sank to a 10-month low as the latest collapse of President Donald Trump's efforts to deliver a new healthcare bill added to worries about the pace of U.S. growth.                  Prices of oil, one of Canada's major exports, rose as demand soaked up some of the surplus supplies from Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and the United States.                  U.S. crude        prices were up 1.69 percent at $46.8 a barrel.     At 9:11 a.m. ET (1311 GMT), the Canadian dollar          was trading at C$1.2611 to the greenback, or 79.30 U.S. cents, up 0.7 percent.     The currency's weakest level was C$1.2702, while it touched its strongest since May 2016 at C$1.2581.     Gains for the loonie came after the Bank of Canada raised interest rates last week for the first time in seven years and signaled it will hike again over the coming months. The currency has gained nearly 7 percent since the central bank turned hawkish in June.     The central bank's policy rate sits at 0.75 percent.     Canadian government bond prices were mixed across the yield curve, with the two-year            down 1 Canadian cent to yield 1.205 percent and the 10-year             flat to yield 1.895 percent.     The gap between the 10-year yield and its U.S. counterpart narrowed by 2.5 basis points to a spread of -38.9 basis points, its narrowest since July 5, 2016.     Lending to Canadian small businesses picked up in May on stronger activity in the agriculture and consumer sectors, data showed, suggesting companies were becoming more willing to invest two years after a slump in oil prices hit the economy.                  Data on Canada's manufacturing sales for May is due on Wednesday, while retail sales data for May and the June inflation report are due out on Friday.

The threat to GM&S; and its 277 jobs is in the political spotlight, as a first industrial policy test for new President Emmanuel Macron's government.  Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire, who took office in May, is pushing for up-front grants of 5 million euros ($5.8 million)from PSA as well as rival Renault, with a matching contribution from the French state. Renault has agreed to contribute 5 million euros and commit to another 50 million in parts orders over five years, raising the pressure on PSA, the maker of Peugeot, Citroen and DS cars.  PSA has confirmed to the minister that it did not wish to participate in this financing,  Le Maire's office said in a statement on Monday. The stand-off deepened on Tuesday as PSA reiterated that it would not go beyond its current offer of a 60 million-euro order commitment over the same five-year period. The Paris-based manufacturer also plans to invest 4 million euros in its own tooling for the GM&S; plant.  We have already made an enormous effort to advance this rescue plan,  a PSA spokesman said.  GM&S; is in this situation today because of other clients who cut their orders.  In support, PSA circulated a July 17 letter in which autos supplier GMD's Chief Executive Alain Martineau informed PSA boss Carlos Tavares that the existing offer is  sufficient to support the site's operations . GMD is proposing to keep  at least 120  of the 277 workers currently employed at GM&S; in the economically deprived central Creuse region of central France. Striking workers from the site blocked a Renault logistics hub in Burgundy on Tuesday. The Poitiers commercial court is due to rule on the rescue plan for the company on Wednesday.

Netanyahu, whose visit to Budapest has been overshadowed by Orban's flirtation with the radical right that has unnerved Hungarian Jews, responded by praising Hungary as a key ally of Israel as it faces growing hostility around the world.  Netanyahu's two-day trip comes less than a month after Orban praised Hungary's interwar leader Miklos Horthy, a Hitler ally, and used an image of Jewish U.S. financier George Soros in an anti-immigration billboard campaign.  It is the duty of every Hungarian government to defend its citizens whatever their heritage. During World War Two Hungary did not honor this moral and political obligation,  Orban told a joint news conference with Netanyahu, adopting a markedly different tone to his usually nationalist rhetoric.  That is a crime, because we chose collaboration with the Nazis over the defense of the Jewish community. That can never happen again. The Hungarian government will defend all of its citizens in the future.  Orban has repeatedly pledged zero tolerance of anti-Semitism but some of his comments have rattled Hungarian Jews, including his praise for Horthy, who only suspended deportations of Jews after the Nazis had shipped half a million to the gas chambers.  Important Words   (Orban) reassured me in unequivocal terms (over the anti-Semitic concerns),  Netanyahu told the news conference.  I appreciate that. These are important words.  He also thanked Orban for  standing up for Israel in international forums.  Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban (R) and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attend a news conference in Budapest, Hungary, July 18, 2017.Bernadett Szabo There is a new anti-Semitism expressed in anti-Zionism,  Netanyahu said.  That is delegitimizing the one and only Jewish state. In many ways Hungary is at the forefront of the states that are opposed to this anti-Jewish policy and I welcome it and express the appreciation of my government.  Netanyahu's visit is the first to Hungary by a serving Israeli prime minister since the fall of communism. He will also meet the Polish, Czech and Slovak leaders in Budapest on Wednesday. Israel has sought better bilateral ties with countries that have a vote in forums such as the European Union or the United Nations, who it hopes will help defend its interests when Israel is criticized. Slideshow (4 Images)Poland has just been elected to the U.N. Security Council as a non-permanent member for the next two years. Orban and Netanyahu have found common cause on the issue of Hungarian-born Soros and his support for non-governmental organizations that have criticized their governments' policies. Earlier this month the Israeli foreign ministry issued a statement denouncing Soros in an apparent attempt to align Israel with Hungary ahead of the Netanyahu trip. The warm ties between Netanyahu and Orban have raised eyebrows in the European Union, where the Hungarian leader is regarded as an illiberal maverick. His party has curtailed press freedom and stymied EU efforts to tackle the migrant crisis. On Tuesday Orban and Netanyahu also discussed mass immigration into Europe as well as other issues. Defending his refusal to accept an EU quota of migrants, Orban said:  Hungary does not want a mixed population, it does not want to change its current ethnic makeup, it will not defer to any external pressure.

Banks, asset managers and insurers have been told to have contingency plans in place showing how they would cope with any abrupt severing in business ties with customers in the EU. While some firms have said privately they are reaching a point of no return and need to move some operations to be ready, Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority, said that the situation differed from firm to firm, and he saw no imminent implementation of contingency plans.  By end of the year firms believe that they are in a position they have to implement (their plans),  Bailey told reporters on Tuesday. Agreement on a transition period between leaving the EU and the start of new trading terms would  break  that time pressure, Bailey said. No transition deal has been agreed, but firms were not talking about actually moving operations yet.  The point at which they think in terms of real business being done and staff moving, they talk more in terms of getting there,  Bailey said. The EU's banking, securities and insurance watchdogs have published guidance for issuing new licences for British-based firms wanting to open new subsidiaries, with the aim of stopping unfair competition between national regulators. Last week the bloc's securities watchdog ESMA published more detailed guidance for asset managers in Britain who want to continue doing business from inside the EU, saying there must be no  letterbox  companies, meaning a presence of substance is required. This has raised fears in the industry that it will curb long-standing  delegation , where asset managers based in Britain manage several funds listed elsewhere in the EU. Bailey said he disagreed with parts of the guidance from ESMA, on which he sits, saying delegation should be allowed to continue after Brexit.  This is a model that works effectively. We know how to regulate it in the public interest. There is no need for it to change,  Bailey said.  I would put the question back to my ESMA colleagues, 'Why do you think Brexit requires these changes to be made?',  he said.

Alinma Bank assisted with structuring the sukuk, the ministry said in a brief statement which did not give further details or specify when issuance would start. It said any issues would be at the ministry's discretion. Finance minister Mohammed al-Jadaan told Al Arabiya television last week that local currency sukuk issues, designed to help Riyadh cover a large budget deficit caused by low oil prices, would begin this month. Besides Alinma, the other qualified banks are Alawwal Bank, Al Rajhi Bank, Arab National Bank, Bank AlBilad, Bank AlJazira, Banque Saudi Fransi, Gulf International Bank, Riyad Bank, Samba Financial Group, Saudi Investment Bank, National Commercial Bank and Saudi British Bank. The ministry did not say how the banks would participate, but commercial bankers said they believed the banks would act as buyers of the bonds in the primary market. Two Saudi bankers predicted the first sukuk offer would be around 10 billion riyals ($2.7 billion) in size, and that issues might then be made monthly. A senior finance ministry official estimated in May that local debt issues would cover 25 to 35 percent of the 2017 deficit, which is officially projected at almost 200 billion riyals. Riyadh launched local currency issues of domestic conventional bonds in 2015 but suspended them late last year after they strained liquidity in the banking system. Liquidity has since improved, and riyal money rates come down, as the government has paid overdue bills to the private sector.

The chairman of a teachers' union described the changes as a huge step in the wrong direction for Turkey's schools and an attempt to avoid raising  generations who ask questions . Education Minister Ismet Yilmaz said the main elements of evolution already underpinned the science curriculum, but there would be no mention of Darwin's landmark theory until university.  Because it is above the students' level and not directly related, the theory of evolution is not part  of the school curriculum, Yilmaz told a news conference. Opposition Republican People's Party lawmaker Mustafa Balbay said any suggestion the theory was beyond their understanding was an insult to high school students.  You go and give an 18-year old student the right to elect and be elected, but don't give him the right to learn about the theory of evolution...This is being close minded and ignorant.  The theory of evolution is rejected by both Christian and Muslim creationists, who believe God created the world as described in the Bible and the Koran, making the universe and all living things in six days. Erdogan, accused by critics of crushing democratic freedoms with tens of thousands of arrests and a clampdown on media since a failed coup last July, has in the past spoken of raising a  pious generation . The curriculum, effective from the start of the 2017-2018 school year, also obliges Turkey's growing number of  Imam Hatip  religious schools to teach the concept of jihad as patriotic in spirit.   It is also our duty to fix what has been perceived as wrong. This is why the Islamic law class and basic fundamental religion lectures will include (lessons on) jihad,  Yilmaz told reporters.  The real meaning of jihad is loving your nation.  Jihad is often translated as  holy war  in the context of fighters waging war against enemies of Islam; but Muslim scholars stress that it also refers to a personal, spiritual struggle against sin. FILE PHOTO: Students of Tevfik Ileri Imam Hatip School wait for the arrival of President Tayyip Erdogan for an opening ceremony in Ankara, Turkey November 18, 2014.Umit Bektas/File PhotoAtaturk Mehhmet Balik, chairman of the Union of Education and Science Workers (Egitim-Is), condemned the new curriculum.  The new policies that ban the teaching of evolution and requiring all schools to have a prayer room, these actions destroy the principle of secularism and the scientific principles of education,  he said. Slideshow (4 Images)Under the AKP, which came to power in 2002, the number of  Imam Hatip  religious schools has grown exponentially. Erdogan, who has roots in political Islam, attended one such school. He has spent his career fighting to bring religion back into public life in constitutionally secular Turkey and has cast himself as the liberator of millions of pious Turks whose rights and welfare were neglected by a secular elite. Liberal Turks see Erdogan as attempting to roll back the work of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the Western-facing founder of modern Turkey who believed education should be free of religious teachings. Some government critics have said the new curriculum - which was presented for public feedback earlier this year - increased the emphasis on Islamic values at the expense of Ataturk's role. But Yilmaz said on Tuesday nothing about Ataturk or his accomplishments had been removed. Changes only emphasized core values such as justice, friendship, honesty, love and patriotism. He said discussion of the militant Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), Islamic State and the network of the U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom Ankara blames for last year's attempted coup, would also be added. Balik, the head of the union, said the changes were being made in an attempt to stamp out dissenting ideas.

Banks, asset managers and insurers have been told to have contingency plans in place showing how they would cope with any abrupt severing in business ties with customers in the EU. While some firms have said privately they are reaching a point of no return and need to move some operations to be ready, Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority, said that the situation differed from firm to firm, and he saw no imminent implementation of contingency plans.  By end of the year firms believe that they are in a position they have to implement (their plans),  Bailey told reporters on Tuesday. Agreement on a transition period between leaving the EU and the start of new trading terms would  break  that time pressure, Bailey said. No transition deal has been agreed, but firms were not talking about actually moving operations yet.  The point at which they think in terms of real business being done and staff moving, they talk more in terms of getting there,  Bailey said. The EU's banking, securities and insurance watchdogs have published guidance for issuing new licences for British-based firms wanting to open new subsidiaries, with the aim of stopping unfair competition between national regulators. Last week the bloc's securities watchdog ESMA published more detailed guidance for asset managers in Britain who want to continue doing business from inside the EU, saying there must be no  letterbox  companies, meaning a presence of substance is required. This has raised fears in the industry that it will curb long-standing  delegation , where asset managers based in Britain manage several funds listed elsewhere in the EU. Bailey said he disagreed with parts of the guidance from ESMA, on which he sits, saying delegation should be allowed to continue after Brexit.  This is a model that works effectively. We know how to regulate it in the public interest. There is no need for it to change,  Bailey said.  I would put the question back to my ESMA colleagues, 'Why do you think Brexit requires these changes to be made?',  he said.

The chairman of a teachers' union described the changes as a huge step in the wrong direction for Turkey's schools and an attempt to avoid raising  generations who ask questions . Education Minister Ismet Yilmaz said the main elements of evolution already underpinned the science curriculum, but there would be no mention of Darwin's landmark theory until university.  Because it is above the students' level and not directly related, the theory of evolution is not part  of the school curriculum, Yilmaz told a news conference. Opposition Republican People's Party lawmaker Mustafa Balbay said any suggestion the theory was beyond their understanding was an insult to high school students.  You go and give an 18-year old student the right to elect and be elected, but don't give him the right to learn about the theory of evolution...This is being close minded and ignorant.  The theory of evolution is rejected by both Christian and Muslim creationists, who believe God created the world as described in the Bible and the Koran, making the universe and all living things in six days. Erdogan, accused by critics of crushing democratic freedoms with tens of thousands of arrests and a clampdown on media since a failed coup last July, has in the past spoken of raising a  pious generation . The curriculum, effective from the start of the 2017-2018 school year, also obliges Turkey's growing number of  Imam Hatip  religious schools to teach the concept of jihad as patriotic in spirit.   It is also our duty to fix what has been perceived as wrong. This is why the Islamic law class and basic fundamental religion lectures will include (lessons on) jihad,  Yilmaz told reporters.  The real meaning of jihad is loving your nation.  Jihad is often translated as  holy war  in the context of fighters waging war against enemies of Islam; but Muslim scholars stress that it also refers to a personal, spiritual struggle against sin. FILE PHOTO: Students of Tevfik Ileri Imam Hatip School wait for the arrival of President Tayyip Erdogan for an opening ceremony in Ankara, Turkey November 18, 2014.Umit Bektas/File PhotoAtaturk Mehhmet Balik, chairman of the Union of Education and Science Workers (Egitim-Is), condemned the new curriculum.  The new policies that ban the teaching of evolution and requiring all schools to have a prayer room, these actions destroy the principle of secularism and the scientific principles of education,  he said. Slideshow (4 Images)Under the AKP, which came to power in 2002, the number of  Imam Hatip  religious schools has grown exponentially. Erdogan, who has roots in political Islam, attended one such school. He has spent his career fighting to bring religion back into public life in constitutionally secular Turkey and has cast himself as the liberator of millions of pious Turks whose rights and welfare were neglected by a secular elite. Liberal Turks see Erdogan as attempting to roll back the work of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the Western-facing founder of modern Turkey who believed education should be free of religious teachings. Some government critics have said the new curriculum - which was presented for public feedback earlier this year - increased the emphasis on Islamic values at the expense of Ataturk's role. But Yilmaz said on Tuesday nothing about Ataturk or his accomplishments had been removed. Changes only emphasized core values such as justice, friendship, honesty, love and patriotism. He said discussion of the militant Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), Islamic State and the network of the U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom Ankara blames for last year's attempted coup, would also be added. Balik, the head of the union, said the changes were being made in an attempt to stamp out dissenting ideas.  The bottom line is: generations who ask questions, that's what the government fears,  he said.

The Dallas-based bank, however, cut its loan growth forecast for the year. U.S. lenders have recently seen a slowdown in loan growth, driven partly by an uptick in interest rates that dissuaded consumers and companies from refinancing mortgage loans. The lender now expects loan growth of 1 percent in 2017 compared with its earlier forecast of a growth of 1 percent to 2 percent. Shares were down about 2 percent in premarket trading. While rising interest rates is hurting loan growth, it is helping banks earn more from deposits. The Fed has raised rates three times since second quarter last year, the latest increase coming in June. Comerica's net income attributable to common shareholders rose to $202 million, or $1.13 per share, in the second quarter ended June 30, from $103 million, or 58 cents per share, a year earlier. (bit.ly/2tBhIwJ) Analysts on average had estimated earnings of $1.06 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Excluding items, the bank earned $1.15 per share. Net interest income rose 12.4 percent to $500 million.  Quarter over quarter, our revenue increased 5 percent as we benefited meaningfully from increased interest rates as well as our relationship banking strategy, which is driving loan and fee growth  Chief Executive Officer Ralph Babb said. Non-interest expenses declined 11.8 percent to $457 million. Provisions for credit losses fell 65.3 percent to $17 million. Provision for credit losses fell 65 percent to $17 million, reflecting an improvement in its energy portfolio. Comerica, like several other U.S. regional banks, has struggled with bad energy loans due to the steep fall in oil prices since mid-2014. Chief Executive Babb said he did not expect the recent decline in energy prices to have a significant impact on the company's energy portfolio.  Total loans dropped nearly 2 percent to $49.41 billion from year ago.

Quarter over quarter, our revenue increased 5 percent as we benefited meaningfully from increased interest rates as well as our relationship banking strategy, which is driving loan and fee growth  Chief Executive Officer Ralph Babb said. Non-interest expenses declined 11.8 percent to $457 million. Provisions for credit losses fell 65.3 percent to $17 million. Provision for credit losses fell 65 percent to $17 million, reflecting an improvement in its energy portfolio. Comerica, like several other U.S. regional banks, has struggled with bad energy loans due to the steep fall in oil prices since mid-2014. Chief Executive Babb said he did not expect the recent decline in energy prices to have a significant impact on the company's energy portfolio.  Total loans dropped nearly 2 percent to $49.41 billion from year ago.

Without further determined progress on structural reforms and rebuilding of fiscal buffers, the economy would remain vulnerable to shocks and risks leavings some segments of the population behind,  the IMF said in the concluding statement of its 2017 report on Spain.  It is time to tackle the remaining vulnerabilities related to elevated public debt and complete the still ongoing post-crisis banking sector adjustment,  it added.  The IMF said Spain's economy recovery had remained strong and revised its growth forecast to 3.1 percent for 2017 compared to a previous estimate of 2.6 percent. Earlier in July, the Spanish government raised its own forecast to 3 percent in 2017 and 2.6 percent in 2018.[nE8N1JB005] The IMF also said reducing still high structural unemployment, especially among Spain's young, and raising productivity growth would be critical for Spain's medium-term economic prospects. Spain's jobless rate has come down but still stands at 18.8 percent, currently the second highest in the European Union after Greece. Regarding the country's financial sector, the IMF said that the  swift resolution  of Banco Popular had removed a source of uncertainty in the banking system.  Popular was taken over by Santander on June 7 for the symbolic price of one euro after European authorities stepped in to prevent its collapse. [nL8N1J40WQ] But, the IMF said in spite of recent consolidation among Spanish banks, there was still room for more mergers or other measures which would help strengthen their profitability.  It said that while lenders had shed non-performing loans and foreclosed assets such as properties sitting on their balance sheets, they remained  relatively high  in a few banks.  A more proactive approach to dealing with legacy issues would help prepare the banking system for new challenges,  the IMF said.

Dubai-based Careem, whose name is a play on the Arabic word for generous or noble, launched in Ramallah in June, aiming to bring digital simplicity to the Palestinian territory. There is certainly a market for easier ride-hailing among the nearly 3 million Palestinians living in the West Bank, but the fact the mobile network is still 2G, that electronic payments are not the norm and that Israeli checkpoints are common, make using the service somewhat cumbersome. Yet Careem is optimistic about the potential.  We are planning to invest hundreds of thousands of dollars within the coming year in the (Palestinian) sector,  Kareem Zinaty, operations manager for the Levant region said.  After the investment, it is also an opportunity to create jobs.  Careem, which launched in 2012 and now operates in 12 countries and more than 80 cities across the Middle East, Africa, and South Asia, has said it aims to provide work for one million people across the region by 2018. An employee shows an advertisement for ride-hailing company Careem, on a laptop in his office in the West Bank city of Ramallah July 17, 2017. Picture taken July 17, 2017.Mohamad TorokmanCareem's Captains While a version of Uber [UBER.UL] and Israeli app Gett already operate in Israel, they do not venture into Palestinian territory. Drivers are excited to work with Careem, which they hope will help boost their incomes, especially with unemployment in the West Bank running at nearly 20 percent.  It's a very wonderful opportunity,” said one of the more than 100 new drivers, known as  captains  by Careem.  Most of the people who use it are young and happy with the price.  Palestinians have limited self rule in parts of the West Bank, which they want for a future state alongside East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip. Israel captured those areas in the 1967 Middle East war. It withdrew from Gaza in 2005, but still occupies the West Bank and East Jerusalem. Under interim peace accords, Israel still controls 60 percent of the West Bank, where most of its settlements are located. Careem's drivers have Palestinian license plates, meaning they usually cannot enter Israeli-controlled areas. In 2015, Israel and the Palestinian Authority agreed to expand 3G mobile access to the West Bank by 2016, but have yet to implement the agreement. In the meantime, the Ramallah municipality has set up public Wifi in parts of the city center, allowing Apps like Careem to be used more easily. Despite 2G's slower service, Zinaty said their model was an opportunity for telecommunication companies to look into expanding services and technologies to better serve Palestinian start ups and businesses.

Shares of Bank of America slipped 0.3 percent, while Goldman Sachs was down 1.2 percent after reporting quarterly results.

News on the healthcare bill sent the U.S. dollar to a 10-month low against a basket of major currencies.  Investor sentiment is pessimistic this morning,  said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets UK.  The fiasco of the healthcare bill means that the tax reforms or the so called infrastructure spending plan are in jeopardy.

As the earnings season gets under way, the market will be keeping a close eye on corporate results to see if the high valuations are justified in the face of mixed economic data, tepid inflation and policy gridlock in Washington.

By Jamie McGeever LONDON, July 18 (Reuters) - For all the talk of secular stagnation, lasting scars from the global financial crisis and investors paralysed by fears over another imminent crash, there's precious little evidence of any of it in financial markets right now. Yes, bond yields are low by historical standards, thanks to a surplus of global savings and years of powerful central bank bond-buying stimulus. But markets are reflecting investors' widespread and deep-rooted belief: extremely bullish. Several market outlooks in recent weeks from a variety of banks, funds and investment houses managing trillions of dollars of investments reveal an overwhelming consensus that growth will remain steady, stocks will continue rising and market volatility will stay low. Blackrock, the world's largest asset manager, reckons the global economy is only half way through its expansion, and says the historically low level of stock market volatility can persist for years. Eric Lonergan at M&G; Investments says the industrialized world is as close to  economic perfection  as you can get and dismisses  secular stagnation  as  patently at odds with the facts . If anything, the global economy and markets are experiencing an unprecedented period of  secular stability . World stocks are their highest ever, led by record highs on Wall Street  , equity market volatility has never been lower, global economic growth is its strongest in six years and corporate profit growth its strongest in seven. Investors are putting their money where their mouths are. According to the latest monthly survey from Bank of America Merrill Lynch, fund managers are loading up most on bank stocks, U.S. and European credit, and euro zone equities, according to BAML. Hardly signs of fear and loathing taking hold. Cash holdings stand at 4.9 percent of portfolios. That's slightly above the 10-year average of 4.5 percent, a level above which sends a contrarian stock market  buy  signal, BAML notes. So even in light of all the bullish talk, portfolios still aren't yet fully invested. By this measure, the green light for further equity gains won't be switching to amber soon, far less red. Only 12 percent of those surveyed say internet stocks are in  bubble  territory, and more than half reckon the Federal Reserve reducing its balance sheet will be a  non-event  or  risk on  for markets. There are risks to the current Goldilocks scenario, including the Fed (and possibly other central bank) policy tightening, a bond market crash, a sharp slowdown in China, and increased political instability in Washington or elsewhere. But these risks have been raised, analyzed and discussed at length in recent months. Even in illiquid, summer markets it's hard to see what the catalyst that will puncture what some observers say is complacency. Ten years ago, then Citigroup chief executive Chuck Prince delivered a line that perfectly summed up the buoyant mood permeating global banking and financial markets.  When the music stops, in terms of liquidity, things will be complicated. But as long as the music is playing, you've got to get up and dance. We're still dancing.  Investors are dancing today and show no sign of changing their tune any time soon. (Reporting by Jamie McGeever)","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/global-markets-optimism-idUSL5N1K93R8"},

I am worried because it's the dry season and I don't have enough food to feed my children,  she said. Kasenza grows potatoes, maize, onions and bananas on 3 hectares (7 acres) of land in the fertile Ruaha basin in southern Tanzania. She says she used to have no problem irrigating her crops but now the river flow slows to a trickle in the dry season.  We have experienced long periods of drought which have badly affected the river flow,  said Kasenza, who runs a channel to drain water from the river to her farm. The 51-year-old mother of six is among the roughly 1 million small-scale farmers who produce much of the East African nation's food, many cultivating rice on water-intensive farms. In the Ruaha basin, the government accuses farmers of illegally squatting on protected land along the river banks. Now, thousands face eviction as authorities try to protect wetlands critical for the river's flow - and the survival of local wildlife. The government says farmers' water-intensive methods and herders' cattle have brought the once mighty river close to death, but farmers and pastoralists say they have lived in harmony with nature for decades, and are victims of drought.  I don't have anywhere to go. We have been staying here all our lives. My children have known no other home than this one,  Kasenza said. Wildlife and Water  Described as the  ecological backbone of Tanzania , the Great Ruaha River flows nearly 500 km (300 miles) from its source in the Kipengere mountains, through vast wetlands and the Ruaha national park before emptying into the Rufiji River in the southeast.  The Ruaha river produced more than half of Tanzania's hydropower for decades but increasingly frequent periods of drought have forced the government to shift to fossil fuels, including gas, for electricity production. A task force set up this year by the Tanzanian government to examine the river's continuing degradation highlighted the impact of intense agriculture on the river's health and recommended the eviction of farmers and pastoralists from some areas.  Speaking in May after reviewing the task force report, Samia Suluhu Hassan, Tanzania's Vice President said the government would consider removing farmers who encroached on water sources to help restore the river's flow.  (We must) come together to save the ecosystem of the valley for the welfare of our lives and the interests of the nation as a whole,  she was reported as saying in local media.  During a visit to the river basin in the Kilolo area last month, muddy, drying ponds were visible along the river and crocodiles and hippos seemingly finding it difficult to cool themselves. In another area, vultures hovered above mounds of dead fish rotting in the sun.  Officials say the degradation of the river spans its entire length, from source to mouth.  In an interview with the Thomson Reuters Foundation, January Makamba, minister of state in the Vice President's environment office, said farmers who divert water from the river to their farms were responsible not only for the degradation of the environment but also for the death of wildlife. It is illegal to divert water from the river in wetland areas the government deems to be protected sites.  We are going to take stern measures against them regardless of their status or position in order to save the river ecology,  he said.  We feel it is necessary to be very aggressive and uncompromising in enforcing the laws.   Long Term Problems Authorities say that the Ruaha river dried up for the first time during the dry season of 1993. Water levels have dropped and dry spells have lengthened since, sometimes lasting several months, the minister said.  You can say, without fear of being contradicted, that the river is collapsing. And, for once, God is not responsible,  Makamba told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. He said that unless urgent action is taken to restore flows to the river, Ruaha National Park - the largest in east Africa and home to about 10 percent of the world's lions - will die.  The beauty of nature across the basin was breath-taking, its destruction is heart-breaking,  he said. According to the minister, farmers with legitimate land claims will be compensated and allocated plots elsewhere but those who occupied land in the river's basin illegally would have to return to  where they came from .   If someone settles in an area that he clearly knows to be protected land, they will not be compensated,  the minister said. According to local analysts however, the government's decision to evict poor farmers from the river basin and the more fertile areas of wetland will cut families off from natural resources they have relied on for generations.  Smallholder farmers along river banks have for a long time  managed to feed themselves and their families adequately without causing any harm to nature,  said Lucas Mnubi, an environmental expert and the editor of Nature magazine in Dar es Salaam. Mnubi said authorities should instead teach communities how to harvest river water sustainably, not evict them from the land. Local farmers say they are being unfairly singled out and the move to evict them would destroy their livelihoods.  We are being accused of destroying water sources, but the government doesn't  realize the biggest enemy is drought,  said Benjamin Nzuki, a farmer in Kilolo. According to Nzuki, local farmers have always tried to conserve water sources, especially in the catchment areas.  We always plant water-friendly trees in order to protect catchment areas so as to allow free flow of the water,  he said. Nzuki called on the government to work with local communities instead of  harassing them and branding them invaders . The minister said farming methods that were less water-intensive would be introduced in some areas and communities taught about the importance of protecting water sources.  We have (also) put a limit on the number of cattle that each household can keep to cope with land scarcity and manage water sustainably,  Makamba said. However herders who graze their animals in the riverlands are not happy.  Pastoralism is business like any other, if you ask me to keep ten cows instead of hundreds you will obviously deny me income,  said Leikim Saburi, a herder in Kilolo district.

Dubai-based Careem, whose name is a play on the Arabic word for generous or noble, launched in Ramallah in June, aiming to bring digital simplicity to the Palestinian territory. There is certainly a market for easier ride-hailing among the nearly 3 million Palestinians living in the West Bank, but the fact the mobile network is still 2G, that electronic payments are not the norm and that Israeli checkpoints are common, make using the service somewhat cumbersome. Yet Careem is optimistic about the potential.  We are planning to invest hundreds of thousands of dollars within the coming year in the (Palestinian) sector,  Kareem Zinaty, operations manager for the Levant region said.  After the investment, it is also an opportunity to create jobs.  Careem, which launched in 2012 and now operates in 12 countries and more than 80 cities across the Middle East, Africa, and South Asia, has said it aims to provide work for one million people across the region by 2018.

Drivers are excited to work with Careem, which they hope will help boost their incomes, especially with unemployment in the West Bank running at nearly 20 percent.  It's a very wonderful opportunity,” said one of the more than 100 new drivers, known as  captains  by Careem.  Most of the people who use it are young and happy with the price.  Palestinians have limited self rule in parts of the West Bank, which they want for a future state alongside East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip. Israel captured those areas in the 1967 Middle East war. It withdrew from Gaza in 2005, but still occupies the West Bank and East Jerusalem. Under interim peace accords, Israel still controls 60 percent of the West Bank, where most of its settlements are located. Careem's drivers have Palestinian license plates, meaning they usually cannot enter Israeli-controlled areas. In 2015, Israel and the Palestinian Authority agreed to expand 3G mobile access to the West Bank by 2016, but have yet to implement the agreement. In the meantime, the Ramallah municipality has set up public Wifi in parts of the city center, allowing Apps like Careem to be used more easily. Despite 2G's slower service, Zinaty said their model was an opportunity for telecommunication companies to look into expanding services and technologies to better serve Palestinian start ups and businesses.

I am worried because it's the dry season and I don't have enough food to feed my children,  she said. Kasenza grows potatoes, maize, onions and bananas on 3 hectares (7 acres) of land in the fertile Ruaha basin in southern Tanzania. She says she used to have no problem irrigating her crops but now the river flow slows to a trickle in the dry season.  We have experienced long periods of drought which have badly affected the river flow,  said Kasenza, who runs a channel to drain water from the river to her farm. The 51-year-old mother of six is among the roughly 1 million small-scale farmers who produce much of the East African nation's food, many cultivating rice on water-intensive farms. In the Ruaha basin, the government accuses farmers of illegally squatting on protected land along the river banks. Now, thousands face eviction as authorities try to protect wetlands critical for the river's flow - and the survival of local wildlife. The government says farmers' water-intensive methods and herders' cattle have brought the once mighty river close to death, but farmers and pastoralists say they have lived in harmony with nature for decades, and are victims of drought.  I don't have anywhere to go. We have been staying here all our lives. My children have known no other home than this one,  Kasenza said.

Dostum, a powerful ethnic Uzbek leader with decades of experience in Afghanistan's wars and turbulent politics, has denied the accusations. Afghan security officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a private jet carrying seven Turkish engineers to Mazar-i-Sharif late on Monday was ordered to fly to Kabul for checks following indications that Dostum was trying to come back to Afghanistan. The plane instead diverted to Turkmenistan. A senior official from Dostum's Junbish party, denied that he had tried to enter Afghanistan, saying that a guest of provincial governor Atta Mohammad Noor had been due to land in Mazar but had gone to Turkmenistan because of technical issues.  If General Dostum wants to come to Afghanistan, no power can stop him because he is Afghanistan's vice president,  said Junbish deputy head Shujauddin Shuja. However, witnesses said hundreds of Dostum's supporters, some carrying posters with slogans like  Welcome back our dear leader!  were waiting in Mazar-i-Sharif, the closest big city to Dostum's home region of Jawzjan, on the border with Turkmenistan.  Dostum is the main leader of the ethnic Uzbek minority, a group estimated to make up some 9 percent of the population, and has been a vocal critic of President Ashraf Ghani. He has not been formally charged with any offence but his departure for Turkey was widely seen as a convenient cover that allowed the government to sideline him without the embarrassment of a public dismissal. However, the case has underlined growing political and ethnic tensions that have threatened the stability of Ghani's unwieldy government, already under pressure over deteriorating security across Afghanistan. Last month, Noor, the powerful governor of Balkh province and one of the main leaders of the Persian-speaking ethnic Tajiks, and deputy Chief Executive Mohammad Mohaqiq, a leader of the mainly Shia ethnic Hazara minority, met Dostum in Turkey. The meeting was widely seen as a possible prelude to a broad opposition movement against the government, which critics say is dominated by Ghani's Pashtun community, traditionally Afghanistan's strongest ethnic group. A spokesman for the NATO-led Resolute Support force, which maintains troops at the Mazar-i-Sharif airport under German command, said that international officials had no role in turning the aircraft away.  Afghan First Vice President Dostum's aircraft was not denied permission to land at Mazar-i-Sharif airport by German forces,  Captain William Salvin said in a statement.  It is not the business of the Resolute Support mission to get involved in internal Afghan government matters.

The presence of suspected insurgents in the camps just across their shared border could further strain relations between the two countries, already at loggerheads over the issue of repatriating around 430,000 Rohingya living in Bangladesh after fleeing Buddhist-majority Myanmar. Manzurul Islam, a 38-year-old Islamic preacher, denied any links to the insurgency in northwestern Myanmar when he spoke to Reuters by telephone from a camp in the Cox's Bazar district of Bangladesh. Two police sources, citing intelligence reports, had said Islam was a member of the Harakah al-Yaqin insurgent group that ambushed Myanmar police border posts in the country's northwest on Oct. 9, killing nine officers.  Since his entrance his movement was suspicious, so members of our security forces and law enforcement agencies monitored him closely,  Bangladesh Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan said, when asked about that information.  They also recorded his phone conversations secretly that showed he had some connections with illegal activities.  Khan declined to give further details about Islam, who is on bail after spending three months in custody in Cox's Bazar town. Bangladeshi officials have previously said no foreign militant organization was active in the country and that it does not tolerate such activities. Khan reiterated that Bangladesh would not allow its territory to be used by any militants. Myanmar's armed forces launched a fierce counterinsurgency operation in response to the October attacks, during which more than 75,000 Rohingya fled to Bangladesh. Harakah al-Yaqin says it is fighting for the rights of 1.1 million Rohingya who live in apartheid-like conditions in Myanmar.  Jungle Training  Islam was arrested from a market near the Kutupalong makeshift camp in Cox's Bazar on Nov. 23, according to a police document seen by Reuters. Police believe he had trained some 30 refugees deep in the jungles near the camp for around two weeks before his arrest, said one of the police sources, who declined to be named given the sensitivity of the matter.  They had no sophisticated weapons but only one or two country-made guns,  said the source.  Security forces went to the training place and found one spot where there were signs that something had happened there: trampled grass, tree branches cleared out, portions of the hill flattened.  Myanmar's police did not respond to a request for comment. But a Myanmar security source said they were aware of Islam's presence in Bangladesh.  Our department received information from the Bangladesh side and we are aware that the man is facing trial,  said the source.  We're not going to accept transfer from Bangladesh ... it's not going to happen.  Islam said Bangladeshi security officials interrogated him for 10 days after his arrest, which he blamed on false information given to the authorities by unidentified enemies.  They accused me of being involved in the insurgency in Myanmar. I told them I had no connection with any group,  he said from Kutupalong, around 400 km (250 miles) southeast of Dhaka, where he lives with his wife and five children.  Nevertheless, they warned me not to get involved in anything wrong and then put me in jail for illegally entering Bangladesh.  Islam, originally from Taung Pyo village just across the border in Myanmar, was charged with entering Bangladesh without proper papers and released on bail on Feb. 15, court documents show. Minister Khan said there was insufficient evidence to charge him with further offences in Bangladesh. Thousands of Rohingya live in Bangladesh without being officially recognized as refugees, but police rarely file immigration charges against them. Still, their presence is a source of tension between the two countries.  We've been continuing our dialogue with the Myanmar government, not only for Islam but for all the illegal entrants, as they are a major problem for us,  Khan said.  They are a burden which we can't afford.  Reporting by Krishna N.

The Australian dollar was by far the biggest beneficiary, jumping 1.8 percent to more than two-year highs after minutes from a Reserve Bank policy meeting showed it turning more upbeat on the economy. In four weeks dominated by doubts over the Federal Reserve's ability to raise interest rates further, and signs that other major central banks are finally turning more hawkish, the dollar is now down more than 3 percent. At 94.650 on Tuesday, the dollar index was down 8.8 percent from the 14-year peak of 103.82 hit on Jan. 3. The euro rose 0.7 percent to $1.1564, its strongest since May last year.  Clearly anything that comes along at the moment just corroborates the market's negative attitude to the dollar,  said Neil Mellor, senior FX strategist with Bank of New York Mellon in London.  There's just not enough inflation at the moment. And anything like this (defeat for Trump) is liable to push it lower.  Two more Republican Senators, Jerry Moran and Mike Lee, announced their opposition late on Monday to a revised Republican healthcare bill, leaving efforts to pass the legislation in chaos.  If the bills won't pass, there will be no money for tax cuts. The implementation of his fiscal policy will be difficult,  said Bart Wakabayashi, Tokyo Branch Manager of State Street. Friday's weak reading on U.S. inflation and retail sales also fanned speculation the Fed may not have justification for another rate hike by the end of this year, despite policymakers' projection for such a move. Money market instruments  price in less than 50 percent chance of a rate increase for the rest of the year. In contrast, central bank policymakers in the euro zone, Britain and Canada have recently signaled they could adjust their policies, with the Bank of Canada raising rates last week for the first time since 2010. But the latest signs from New Zealand, Sweden and the United Kingdom all point in the opposite direction. British inflation surprised by falling for the first time since October, knocking a whole cent off the value of the pound against the dollar and weakening it 1 percent against the euro.

The Syrian agriculture ministry's wheat production forecast puts the 2017 crop higher at 2 million tonnes. Officials, traders and farmers told Reuters earlier in July that figure was grossly inflated. Syria used to produce 4 million tonnes in a good year and was able to export 1.5 million tonnes. The fall in output has put President Bashar al-Assad's government under increasing pressure to import the grain. The latest assessment, conducted by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the World Food Programme (WFP) said the crop had improved on better rainfall and improved access to agricultural land.  Main constraints continue to be the high cost or unavailability of inputs, such as seeds and fertilizer, and the destruction of infrastructure,  the statement said. Syria's wheat harvest dropped to its lowest level in 27 years in 2016, with some estimates putting it as low as 1.3 million tonnes, as fighting and poor rainfall further degraded the farming sector. The FAO and WFP said this year's harvest would be 12 percent higher but did not give a comparative figure for last year. Despite the increase in production, it is unclear how much of the harvest the government will be able to procure. Syria's state grain buyer Hoboob purchases the local crop on behalf of the government. It has so far bought only around 250,000 tonnes, one government source said.  We need to still assess and evaluate how much they (the government) will be able to buy because the trend is that there is cross-border trade,  Adam Yao, FAO Syria Representative, told Reuters in a telephone interview from Damascus. Some of the wheat produced in Hasaka, for example, filters out into neighboring Iraq and Turkey, Yao said. A large part of Syria's agricultural heartland in the north has been under the control of Islamic State since 2014, when the ultra-hardline jihadist group swept through the area and established a de facto capital in Raqqa. While Islamic State has been slowly driven back from its territory by U.S.-backed forces in recent weeks, the retreating militants have laid waste to agricultural infrastructure in the area, which produces the bulk of Syria's main staple wheat.  In Raqqa, shops are destroyed and the cost of the standard food basket has jumped by 42 percent between May and June this year,  the study said. The report estimates that 6.9 million Syrians are still food insecure, while an additional 5.6 million people are likely to become food insecure without the regular food assistance they receive every month.  Access by humanitarian organizations to some besieged areas has improved compared to last year. Yet access continues to be heavily constrained in Deir-ez-Zor, where life-saving air-drops of food and other supplies continue, and in Raqqa where the situation has become critical due to the continuing fighting.

While the running ability of T-rex has been hotly debated among palaeontologists for decades, the consensus from previous biomechanical models was that the Cretaceous-era carnivore could manage speeds of up to 45 mph (75 kmh). That's more than half as fast again as the quickest man in history. But because of its size and weight, the predator would actually have broken its legs had it tried to break into a sprint, the University of Manchester research showed.   The muscles need to be able to generate sufficient power to allow high-speed locomotion, but at the same time the skeleton has to be able to cope with the loads generated by the high speed,  said Professor William Sellers from the university's School of Earth and Environmental Sciences   ...This is where it fails. T-rex's skeleton is simply not strong enough for running locomotion,  he told Reuters. Researchers used an engineering technique called multibody dynamic analysis, coupled with machine learning, to produce what they say is the most accurate simulation of T-rex's gait and biomechanics to date. They concluded that T-rex was limited to walking speeds of about 5 meters/second, equating to 12 mph (18 kmh) -- less than half the speed of Usain Bolt's personal best of 27.8 mph.  A study published in Royal Society journal Biological Sciences in 2007 suggested an at that time conservative top speed of 18 mph - still fast enough to chase down top runners over longer distances. Sellers said his study had forced a re-think on how T-rex caught its prey.  It certainly would not have been able to chase down faster-moving prey animals,  said Sellers.  That leaves other hunting options such as ambush, and of course it means that (discredited) ideas such as 'T-rex the scavenger' have to be reconsidered.

Mass prison breaks, kidnappings, rising militia violence and surging lawlessness since Kabila failed to step down in December have raised fears Democratic Republic of Congo could slip back into the chaos and conflict of the turn of the century that killed millions. About 4,000 inmates escaped from Kinshasa's main prison in May and unidentified assailants killed at least two people and wounded six police officers in an attack last Friday on the city's largest market, leading some Kabila allies to call for a state of emergency. In an decree read late Monday evening on national television, Kabila named Dieudonne Amuli Bahigwa to replace Charles Bisengimana as chief of the national police.  Amuli is a veteran army general who led military operations in eastern Congo in 2009 against the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), one of the largest and most dangerous armed groups operating in the region. Sylvano Kasongo Kitenge was named to replace Celestin Kanyama as head of police in Kinshasa. Kanyama came under U.S. and EU sanctions last year for alleged human rights violations by the police in suppressing anti-Kabila protests. A presidential election to replace Kabila, in power since 2001, was scheduled for last November but was postponed due to delays registering voters.  Congo's election commission head said this month it would probably not be possible to hold the vote this year, leading Kabila's opponents to threaten further street demonstrations.

The first inquiry, set out in January 2016, stems from a report that found that senior managers were responsible for the bank's collapse in the 2007-09 financial crisis. The second relates to events surrounding the discovery of misconduct within the HBOS Impaired Assets team based in Reading, west of London, which dealt with companies in financial distress. The FCA's civil investigation was reopened in April after former HBOS bankers were jailed in February.  We are ... joining it with the investigation that we announced in January last year,  Financial Conduct Authority Chief Executive Andrew Bailey told the watchdog's annual meeting on Tuesday. Bailey said that police had recently passed on evidence from the trial to the FCA and the information is now being absorbed by the watchdog.  It will be completed as soon as is possible. I can't put a date on that,  Bailey said. He later clarified to reporters that evidence from the trial would feed into the investigation of senior officials, who have not been named.  There are two cases and the cases remain separate, but the evidence from Reading obviously informs the ongoing case,  Bailey told reporters. Bailey said there would be separate outcomes from the two investigations.

Soldiers took Aye Nai, Pyae Phone Aung and Lawi Weng, and three ethnic minority men traveling with them, into custody on June 26.  The journalists were on their way back from reporting on some illegal drugs being burned by the Ta'ang National Liberation Army, a rebel group fighting the army for greater autonomy. In video filmed after the procedural court hearing on Tuesday, released by Democratic Voice of Burma (DVB), the three are seen giving their first comments to media since their arrest. Aye Nai said in the video they were held for two days and questioned by members of an army regiment based in the northeastern town of Hsipaw, before being handed over to police. The military then filed charges accusing all six of  unlawful association  under a colonial-era law.   The Ministry of Home Affairs should be handling the case, but the military is handling the case and I think it shouldn’t be like that,  Aye Nai says. The military's communications unit, the True News Information Team, could not immediately be reached for comment. The military ruled Myanmar for decades after seizing power in a 1962 coup but has made way for a civilian government led by democracy champion Aung San Suu Kyi, whose party swept an election in late 2015. But Nobel laureate Suu Kyi remains constrained by a constitution that protects the military's role in politics. The case of the three reporters has raised concern in the media in Myanmar that gains in press freedom since the beginning of the transition from full military rule could be going into reverse. Journalists have warned that jailing colleagues for doing their jobs would have a chilling effect on freedom of expression. The DVB, the employer of Aye Nai and Pyae Phone Aung, and the Irrawaddy magazine, where Lawi Weng is a senior reporter, were both set up in exile when the military still held full power and stifled the press. Both publications set up bureaus in the commercial hub Yangon after the government dropped pre-publication censorship in 2012. The court in Hsipaw had previously announced that the six men would appear on Friday, but the case was unexpectedly brought forward, meaning at least one lawyer was absent on Tuesday. “I planned to go there on Friday, the scheduled date. I was not informed that the court date was moved,” the DVB reporters' lawyer, Maung Maung Win, told Reuters. In the video, the six men are all seen chained together with handcuffs.   Can you call this democracy?  People have been shouting about democracy,  says Lawi Weng.  This is a threat from the military.” Reporting by Shoon Naing; Editing by Simon Lewis, Robert Birsel","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-military-journalists-idUSKBN1A31BG"},

Many roads, bridges, tunnels and metro stations were flooded and cars submerged in torrential downpours that followed two hours of lightning flashes across the city. Television footage showed people swimming in the streets and being rescued by boats from streets and flooded houses. Heavy rainfall and poor visibility caused traffic through the Bosphorus, an important international shipping lane for oil and grain, to be suspended from 8.30 a.m. (0530 GMT) to midday, shipping agents said. Turkish authorities also closed the Dardanelles strait to tankers longer than 200 meters after an oil tanker ran aground, but also reopened the strait at noon.

An unexpected drop in UK inflation in June could grant rate-setters more time to decide whether to raise interest rates for the first time in a decade. The index of consumer prices rose 2.6 percent in June compared with a year ago, the Office for National Statistics said on Tuesday. Though that’s still well above the central bank’s 2 percent target, it’s below the 2.9 percent increase in May. It’s also in line with the central bank’s expectations of a temporary spike in prices caused by the pound’s decline after the 2016 Brexit referendum. Meanwhile, slightly lower inflation eases the pressure on the UK government to relax its cap on public sector wages, which cannot rise by more than 1 percent a year. The BoE still faces a difficult balancing act. Unemployment is at its lowest level in four decades. Economic growth and business confidence have held up. At the same time, though, real disposable income has fallen for three straight quarters and the portion of disposable income that households save is at an all-time low. Consumption has been propped up by a rise in consumer borrowing – itself fuelled by low rates – that the BoE fears brings growing financial risks. Brexit further complicates the picture. The sharp slowdown in growth expected to follow June 2016’s referendum has not materialised. Even so, Britain’s departure from the European Union promises to be messy. Businesses are already making preparations to shift: U.S. bank Citigroup is this week expected to pick Frankfurt as its EU base, two sources told Reuters on Monday. A slowdown in investment might prompt the BoE to delay a rate hike. One month’s data would not normally be sufficient to sway the decision. But the committee is finely balanced: three of its members voted to hike rates in June, and BoE Chief Economist Andy Haldane later admitted he had considered joining them. Weaker inflation gives policymakers another reason to sit on their hands on August 3. The long-awaited normalization of monetary policy may have to wait a bit longer.BreakingviewsReuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko dismissed the idea, describing Alexander Zakharchenko, leader of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic (DNR), as part of  a puppet show , with Russia pulling his strings in order to relay a message. Ukrainian officials said Russia wanted to show the world, and the United States especially, it could keep the crisis in a suspended state and deepen it if need be. A new U.S. envoy for the Ukraine crisis was appointed this month and Moscow and Washington are likely to start regularly engaging on the issue. Zakharchenko, who scarcely would have expected anything other than outright rejection from Kiev, said in a declaration that he and his allies were proposing a new state called Malorossiya (Little Russia) be set up with its capital in rebel-held Donetsk. Malorossiya was the term used to describe swaths of modern-day Ukraine when they were part of the Russian Empire and is one which many Ukrainians today regard as offensive.  We are proposing to residents of Ukraine a peaceful way out of a difficult situation without war. It's our last proposal,  Zakharchenko said in a statement. The new state would be federal, with regions enjoying a large degree of autonomy. He said the move was backed by delegates from different Ukrainian regions, though a statement from the neighbouring rebel territory of the self-proclaimed Luhansk People's Republic said it had been unaware of the initiative.  Sick Fantasies  His declaration cast a shadow over the faltering Minsk peace agreement between the rebels and the Ukrainian government which has failed to quell fighting between the two sides and has only been partially implemented since a pro-Russian uprising broke out in eastern Ukraine in 2014. Russia denies accusations it has delivered arms and provided troops backing rebels in the industrial, largely Russian-speaking east. Yevhen Marchuk, Ukraine's representative in talks on implementing the peace deal, told Ukrainian TV channel 112.ua that Zakharchenko's declaration would complicate negotiations and looked like a Russian attempt to sabotage the process. France, which along with Germany has been closely involved in trying to resolve the Ukraine crisis, condemned the idea and demanded Russia do more to prevent a further escalation. A German government spokeswoman also criticised the move, calling it  totally unacceptable.  Ukraine's top military commander, Viktor Muzhenko, said on social media that the Ukrainian people would  bury  Malorossiya, calling the plan one of the rebels'  sick fantasies . The Kremlin, which denies allegations it controls the rebels, was expected to comment on the matter later on Tuesday. Three former rebel leaders told Reuters in May that a top aide to Russian President Vladimir Putin decides how the pro-Moscow administration of eastern Ukraine is run and who gets what jobs there, challenging Kremlin denials that it calls the shots in the region.

By Beth Pinsker NEW YORK, July 18 (Reuters) - Despite a record-high U.S. stock market and a positive economic outlook, U.S. parents spent less on college tuition during the 2016-17 school year, according to Sallie Mae's 10th annual  How America Pays for College  report. Out-of-pocket spending by parents fell to 23 percent from 29 percent of the average amount the typical family pays for college, according to a survey released Monday. That translates to about $5,527 out of the average $23,757 yearly tab. That's the lowest dollar amount spent by parents since 2009, as well as the smallest percentage of the total tuition spent since the study started. Much of the difference was made up by a big jump in student borrowing to 19 percent of the total, from 13 percent. Sallie Mae's study does not directly address why parental spending fell, but there are several indicators.  It could be price sensitivity,  says Mark Kantrowitz, publisher of Cappex.com, a college financing resource.  Parents may be telling students, if you want to go to that more expensive school, you'll have to pay for it.  Model Budgeting The typical family that emerges from Sallie Mae's study is not big on planning: While 9 out of 10 expect their kids to go to college, only 4 out of 10 budget for it. But there are some bright spots, notably that 69 percent eliminated some colleges from their selections because of cost, a number that jumped from 58 percent ten years ago. For those taking active steps, like saving in a tax-advantaged 529 plan, the road to college is a lot less bumpy. Financial adviser Therese Nicklas serves as a model for her Boston-based clients. Her first step was deciding on a budget based on what she could reasonably save over time and what she could take from monthly cash flow to stash money away for two kids.  I told my kids, if you go over, you'll have to borrow,  says Nicklas. Her older son was disciplined about working and graduated with less than $25,000 in loans, but her younger son racked up so much debt he had to live at home after graduation while he aggressively chipped away at it. One way families can come up with a reasonable budget number is by filling out the federal financial aid form known as the FAFSA, regardless of whether they think they will be getting financial aid. Sallie Mae's survey found that FAFSA participation has made a steady climb to 86 percent, 12 percent higher than in 2008. The FAFSA calculates an  expected family contribution  which colleges can use to calculate financial aid awards. But it also may be serving as a psychological cap for what parents can reasonably shell out.  Two decades ago, college costs could be more related to buying a car. Now these costs are like buying a house. It’s two completely different scenarios,  says financial adviser Melissa Sotudeh, who is based in the Washington, D.C. area Facing Loans While planning ahead works for parents, students have fewer options. Federal student loans max out at about $27,000, with no limit on higher-interest private borrowing. Therese Nicklas is a big fan of leaning on student income from work rather than loans, but there's only so much of a dent a student is able to make in their total loans with their pay checks, especially if they face a massive tuition bill. Sallie Mae's survey found that 76 percent of students work to help pay their costs, with 55 percent of those working year-round. About 1 percent of families use home equity loans or retirement plan loans, while about 3 percent put tuition on credit cards. Parents also take out federal PLUS loans and private loans.  I heavily discourage 401(k) loans. I also discourage pulling money out of Roth IRAs,  says financial adviser Jason Lina, who is based in the Atlanta area.  But credit card debt is the worst.

Africa's top copper producer, Congo has been hit hard by low commodity prices over the last two years and is seeking emergency financial support from international donors to contain inflation expected to top 30 percent this year. The decree, signed by central bank governor Deogratias Mutombo, imposes a penalty of 1 percent of the non-repatriated sum for each day that it is not repatriated. It also decrees a fine of up to 200 million Congolese francs ($125,000) for failure to communicate to the central bank details of a foreign bank account. Mutombo said that the action was taken due to  the manifest failure by certain economic operators (to) respect legal and regulatory dispositions . In a speech on Monday in the mining hub of Lubumbashi, Mutombo said the bank would deploy teams of experts to verify that information submitted by mining companies to the central bank is consistent with their internal financial reports.

Nationwide, home price growth slowed slightly last month as government restrictions to keep prices in check weighed on larger cities, though smaller cities maintained rapid growth due to less severe checks.  Big cities such as Beijing have acted swiftly this year to quell speculative property buying that have shattered price records and fueled concerns about housing affordability. Worries about growing household leverage have been joined by anxiety over China's addiction to debt, which authorities have been trying to curb over the past year in an effort to defuse financial risks.  The latest data suggests the real estate sector is cooling off at a moderate pace and is unlikely to suffer a steep correction as some had feared. In June, average new home prices in China's 70 major cities rose 10.2 percent from a year earlier, decelerating from May's 10.4 percent gain, according to Reuters calculations based on data issued by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). On a monthly basis, new home prices rose 0.7 percent in June, the same as the previous month's reading, the  calculations showed.  Sales declines in the biggest cities were quite significant, so prices are certainly not going to rebound,  said Rosealea Yao, a property economist with Gavekal Dragonomics.  The mild declining trend will continue through at least the first half of 2018,  Yao said. More than 45 cities, most of them top-tier cities with a sizable population, have imposed varying levels of restrictions since last October to curb fast-rising prices, with most of the latest measures introduced in late March.  The cooling effect is most visible in China's the biggest cities. Price growth in Shenzhen, Shanghai and Beijing slowed to 2.7 percent, 8.6 percent and 10.7 percent, respectively, from a year earlier. From a month earlier, prices in Beijing fell 0.4 percent, marking the first fall since February 2015. Shanghai prices slipped by a further 0.2 percent, while Shenzhen prices remained unchanged. FILE PHOTO: Apartment blocks and villas (bottom) are pictured in Wuqing District of Tianjin, China September 10, 2016.Jason Lee/File PhotoDeclining Sales The value of new personal home mortgages in Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen in the first half of 2017 was equal to 30 percent of the total value of home loans in 2016, a Chinese state newspaper reported. Still, real estate investment and sales growth both sped up in June after slowing in May, most likely due to more robust demand in smaller centers that have been encouraged to reduce inventory and are not subject to the strict curbs at work in bigger cities. Luoyang, a third-tier city in central Henan province, topped the list in June, with prices of new units up 2.3 percent on month, compared with a 1.3 percent gain in May, taking the annual growth to 10.2 percent.   That has also been reflected in stronger credit demand in the month from households. Keeping a lid on price fluctuations has become a priority for policymakers in a politically important year, with a major leadership reshuffle expected this autumn. But to make sure the market is neither too hot nor too cold, authorities have increasingly resorted to administrative measures that many analysts warn are anti-market in nature. For example, sales prices for new units in a few cities like Zhengzhou - capital of Henan - are not allowed to be higher than the price level seen last October for new units in the vicinity.     Fading Affordability  The upsurge in house prices since 2001 in most major Chinese cities has spurred growing concerns about affordability. A typical two-bedroom new home in Beijing now costs around 6 million yuan ($870,000), about 69 times the average per capita disposable income in the city, much higher than the ratio of less than 25 times for New York City.  Economists worry that slowing growth in incomes, which had been rising at double-digit rates for decades, will no longer be able to cushion financial risks in an extremely inflated housing market. On average, China's disposable income was up 8.1 percent on-year for city-dwellers in the first half of the year, official data showed, slower than the 10.2 percent annual property price growth in June.

Several big asset managers are holders of its Eurobond. IBA infuriated investors when it first unveiled the restructuring in May but, after modifying terms, offered them the chance to swap their holdings for sovereign bonds, with senior creditors given three options.

The success of the operation would help the government meet a target of privatising IBA by the end of 2018. IBA is being advised by Lazard and White & Case LLP. A global slump in oil prices has battered the economy of the former Soviet republic, in turn hurting Azerbaijan's manat currency and local banks.

Further monetary policy tightening  is desirable  until there are clear signs that inflationary pressures are subsiding, the IMF said in a statement before markets opened on Tuesday. The global lender, which completed its second review of a $1.5 billion loan approved in May last year, said Sri Lanka's performance under its programme has been  broadly satisfactory . The completion of the second review will enable the IMF to release a third tranche of aid of about $167.2 million, bringing total disbursements under the arrangement to the equivalent of about $501.5 million. The spot rupee closed at 153.75/80 per dollar, compared with Monday's close of 153.70/73.  The expected IMF disbursement failed to boost the market. There was some importer (dollar) demand,  a currency dealer said asking not to be named. Analysts expect the currency to depreciate 4 percent this year. It has already fallen 2.6 percent so far in 2017. Central Bank Governor Indrajith Coomaraswamy said on Monday the rupee was still  over-valued  and that the central bank was still buying dollars to avoid any appreciation. He told Reuters that the central bank had bought dollars in the range of $750 million to $800 million from the market, out of the $1.2 billion it had planned to purchase in the 10 months from March this year. The central bank is compelled to buy dollars from the market to meet a reserves target set by the IMF under a $1.5 billion, three-year loan programme. Seasonal demand for dollars is expected to pick up from August, dealers said.

The views expressed are his own.) U.S. oil and gas exploration and production companies are drilling new wells faster than they can be fractured and hooked up to gathering systems, creating a growing backlog of drilled but uncompleted oil and gas wells. By June, the number of drilled but uncompleted oil and gas wells across the seven largest shale plays had topped 6,000, according to estimates from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The estimated number of uncompleted wells across the seven plays has risen by more 1,000 since December 2016, the agency reported on Monday ( Drilling productivity report , EIA, July 2017). The problem is concentrated in the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico, where the number of uncompleted wells has risen by more than 800 since December and more than 1,000 since June 2016. In most other shale plays, the estimated number of drilled but uncompleted wells has been broadly stable over the last year (tmsnrt.rs/2tBi32e). There are now almost 2,250 uncompleted wells in the Permian, up from an estimated 1,200 a year ago, and compared with 3,800 across all the other plays combined. Since the Permian has accounted for more than 40 percent of the extra drilling rigs deployed countrywide over the last year, the concentration of uncompleted wells in the region is not surprising. But the growing number of uncompleted wells represents an obvious imbalance and is ultimately unsustainable, so either the number of new wells drilled must slow or the completion rate must increase (tmsnrt.rs/2uDTreh). The lengthening backlog mostly reflects the shortage of fracking and completion crews, though in a few cases it may reflect a strategic decision to delay bringing wells onstream to wait for higher prices. However, drilling is expensive, using up corporate cash, and wells do not start earning a return until they start flowing, so in most cases there is an incentive to flow them as soon as practical. There are some indications the number of rigs drilling for oil may be stabilizing in response to the fall in WTI prices since February, which should help get the backlog under control (tmsnrt.rs/2u5jnhw). But the large backlog of wells already drilled implies output will continue growing through the rest of 2017 and into 2018, which is likely to act as a cap on oil prices (tmsnrt.rs/2tBO9uG). And the inventory overhang of uncompleted wells will add to instability if WTI prices decline further and force exploration and production companies to curb drilling programs.

The setback leaves the party to weigh a repeal-only strategy to buy more time for a possible replacement plan later as President Donald Trump vowed to return with a new proposal.  As I have always said, let ObamaCare fail and then come together and do a great healthcare plan. Stay tuned!  he tweeted, blaming Democrats and a few members of his own party. Senate Republicans' second attempt at a healthcare bill collapsed on Monday as two more senators refused to back it, prompting President Donald Trump to urge an outright repeal even as other Republicans sought a shift toward bipartisanship with Democrats. Republican's healthcare failure spelled uncertainty for Trump's other top agenda items of tax reform and an infrastructure overhaul, leaving the president without any major legislative accomplishments six months into his tenure. On Monday, Republican Senators Mike Lee and Jerry Moran joined colleagues Susan Collins and Rand Paul in opposing the legislation that would unwind the 2010 Affordable Care Act passed under Democratic former president Barack Obama. Their refusal, combed with full opposition from Democrats, left Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell without enough votes to pass the bill in the 100-member Senate. Trump said Congress should  start from a clean slate  on a new plan that he said Democrats would join. McConnell said he would try to bring repeal legislation to the Senate floor in coming days, but with a two-year delay in implementation to assure a smooth transition. Democrats have remained united against Republican's efforts to undo Obama's signature domestic achievement that aimed to reduce the number of people without health insurance and help lower healthcare costs even as they acknowledged changes were needed. In a statement late Monday, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer urged Republicans to  start from scratch  with Democrats. Representatives for Schumer could not be immediately reached for comment on Trump's Tuesday tweet putting the blame on  all of the Democrats.  Some Republican and Democratic U.S. governors, who help oversee the joint federal-state Medicaid program for the poor as well as private health insurers, have balked at Republican lawmaker's efforts to undo a law that expanded Medicaid in some states and reduced the number of uninsured people. Virginia's Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat who heads the National Governors Association, on Tuesday told CNN that a repeal-only measure  will only bring more uncertainty. Uncertainty is crushing this market because the insurance companies don't know what to do.  Republicans in Congress had hoped to finish with healthcare before an upcoming August recess so they could tackle a wide-ranging rewrite of the U.S. tax code in September. But their failure exposed the sharp divide within their own ranks between moderates concerned about Medicaid cuts and conservatives who back them and want even more dramatic changes. A similar version of the Senate bill passed the House in May but legislation must pass both chambers for Trump to sign into law. As of late Monday, House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan had no immediate comment on his next steps. The U.S. dollar sank to a 10-month low against a basket of major currencies , hit by the latest collapse of efforts to deliver a new healthcare bill in a market deeply worried by the pace of U.S. growth.

Grabbing a bigger piece of the reservations pie has become a priority for chains trying to limit the flow of commission dollars to companies like Expedia Inc and Priceline Group Inc.   It's costly for hotel companies,  said Telsey Advisory Group analyst David Katz.  Necessary, but costly.  Cutting commissions is important enough that the hotel chains have made it easier for loyal customers to win free stays. This has helped them gain ground, although online travel agents still account for the overwhelming majority of U.S. hotel bookings. Six of the top 10 hotel brands had direct bookings increase from May 2016 to May 2017, a recent report by audience insight company Hitwise showed, while just three of the top eight online travel agencies had more bookings during that period.  Wyndham Worldwide Corp, the No. 3 U.S. hotel chain by market cap, more than tripled its share of direct bookings to 9.61 percent, according to the report. Marriott had the industry's biggest share of direct bookings, at 26.21 percent in May 2017. FILE PHOTO - A view shows the Hilton hotel in central Kiev, Ukraine, April 4, 2016.Gleb Garanich/File PhotoDan Wasiolek, an analyst with Morningstar, said Wyndham's jump surprised him, though the company started at a lower base. He cited a $100 million revamping of its loyalty program eliminating blackout dates and other restrictions common to other chains' rewards programs.  Barry Goldstein, Wyndham's chief marketing officer, said in an interview that the loyalty program helped attract more travelers to Wyndham. He said the new rewards program helped drive direct bookings, as did making the chain's website and app more mobile-friendly. Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc and Marriott International Inc have also heavily promoted the linkage between loyalty rewards and direct bookings. Hilton's  Stop Clicking Around  advertising campaign, touted as its largest ever when it was launched in February 2016,  offered loyalty members a discount when booking directly from the hotel's website. Marriott created a similar campaign, also offering discounts to members who booked directly starting in April 2016. Loyalty programs allow hotel companies to circumvent the rate parity rule barring hotel companies from advertising lower rates on their sites than are available through the online agencies, Wasiolek said. But they present the risk of getting travelers to accustomed to discounted rates or free stays.

Naftogaz plans to sign an framework agreement with Vattenfall which will allow it to buy gas worth up to 105.9 billion hryvnias ($4.1 billion), a July 17 regulatory filing showed.

Ukraine has not imported gas directly from Russia since November 2015, instead relying on imports from EU member states and its own production. In the first half of the 2017, Ukraine imported 7 billion cubic metres of gas from Europe and produced 10.3 billion cubic metres. Naftogaz bought gas from 14 European traders last year, funded partly by loans from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.

The $4 trillion blueprint would allow an overhaul of the U.S. tax code to pass Congress without support from Democrats, along with a partial repeal of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law and $203 billion in savings from mandatory federal programs including food stamps over the next decade. Those changes and others would be combined in a single piece of legislation. The prospect of reduced benefits for the poor and major tax cuts for businesses and individuals is already a source of infighting between House Republican conservatives who want larger spending reductions and moderates who oppose them. In the Senate, a similar Republican battle over the repeal of Obamacare taxes on the wealthy and reduced health insurance benefits for lower-income Americans has helped sink healthcare legislation. The spending plan, which covers the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, aims to move the government from a $472 billion deficit in 2018 to a $9 billion budget surplus in 2027. The change is based in part on a House Budget Committee forecast of U.S. economic growth of 2.6 percent annually that assumes future changes in tax, healthcare and financial laws, as well as deregulation. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has forecast economic growth of 1.9 percent from 2017 to 2027. The House budget plan would include $621.5 billion in defense spending and $511 billion on nondefense discretionary spending in 2018. The House Budget Committee is expected to approve the plan later this week and send it to the House floor for a full vote. The plan is vital to Republican aims of overhauling the U.S. tax code while avoiding a Democratic filibuster in the Senate. The plan instructs 11 House committees to find savings from programs and policies they oversee, including taxes, financial regulation, food stamps and federal pensions. The instructions would allow final legislation to pass the Senate with a simple majority through a parliamentary process know as reconciliation. Republicans control the Senate by a 52-48 margin. Without reconciliation, tax reform would require 60 Senate votes. (Editing by Sandra Maler and Jeffrey Benkoe)","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-congress-budget-idUSL1N1K90E0"},

Palestinian officials have urged China, which supports an independent Palestinian state, to do more in the Middle East peace process. Chinese envoys occasionally visit Israel and the Palestinian Territories, though China has traditionally played little role in Middle East conflicts or diplomacy despite its reliance on the region for oil. Speaking to reporters after meeting Abbas in Beijing's Great Hall of the People, Xi said the international community paid close attention to the Middle East peace process.   As the Palestinian people's good friend, partner and brother, China hopes Palestine and Israel can achieve peace as soon as possible and live and work in peace. China will make unremitting efforts for this,  Xi said, after receiving a Palestinian medal of honor from Abbas. China has historically had a good relationship with the Palestinians.  The Middle East, however, is fraught with risk for China, which has little experience navigating the religious and political tensions that frequently rack the region. Deputy Chinese Foreign Minister Zhang Ming later said Xi reiterated support for the establishment of a Palestinian state, and also called for the security of both the Palestinians and Israelis to be protected. China's President Xi Jinping (L) and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas attend a welcoming ceremony outside the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, China July 18, 2017.Jason LeeIt is important to advance a political settlement on the basis of the two state solution, Zhang added, paraphrasing Xi.  U.S. President Donald Trump has renewed efforts to get Israeli-Palestinian talks going again, after they collapsed in 2014.  Slideshow (14 Images)His Middle East envoy, Jason Greenblatt, announced an Israeli-Palestinian water agreement last week but dodged questions on whether he was making headway on reviving peace talks. Diplomats say that China is trying to play the role of  honest broker  in the Middle East, as it lacks the historical baggage of the Americans or the Europeans. Xi told visiting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in March that peaceful coexistence between Israel and the Palestinians would be good for both parties and the region, and that it was favored by the international community. Netanyahu's trip came just days after China hosted Saudi Arabia's King Salman and signed deals worth as much as $65 billion with Riyadh. China also has close ties with Iran, whose nuclear program has seriously alarmed Israel and Saudi Arabia. More broadly, China hopes a peaceful Middle East will lessen the flow of ethnic Uighurs, a Muslim people from the far western Chinese region of Xinjiang, to Syria and Iraq to join up with militant groups there.

Despite or even because of Brexit, European integration remains one of the best ideas that Europeans had in the 20th century,  Schaeuble said in a letter, seen by Reuters on Tuesday and sent to lawmakers from Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives and the co-governing Social Democrats (SPD). Germany and France now had to work closely together and pull in the same direction to strengthen cooperation in the soon-to-be 27-member bloc, the veteran politician said, urging all euro zone governments to further implement structural reforms, reduce debt and make their budgets more sustainable.  Germany advocates a steady implementation of these (fiscal) agreements and is also ready to more effectively prevent future crises and further deepen the monetary union,  he said.  The rule for this is simple and convincing: To set the right incentives and avoid non-sustainable developments, risks and liabilities must be at the same level and in one hand.

Grabbing a bigger piece of the reservations pie has become a priority for chains trying to limit the flow of commission dollars to companies like Expedia Inc and Priceline Group Inc.   It's costly for hotel companies,  said Telsey Advisory Group analyst David Katz.  Necessary, but costly.  Cutting commissions is important enough that the hotel chains have made it easier for loyal customers to win free stays. This has helped them gain ground, although online travel agents still account for the overwhelming majority of U.S. hotel bookings. Six of the top 10 hotel brands had direct bookings increase from May 2016 to May 2017, a recent report by audience insight company Hitwise showed, while just three of the top eight online travel agencies had more bookings during that period.  Wyndham Worldwide Corp, the No. 3 U.S. hotel chain by market cap, more than tripled its share of direct bookings to 9.61 percent, according to the report. Marriott had the industry's biggest share of direct bookings, at 26.21 percent in May 2017. FILE PHOTO - A view shows the Hilton hotel in central Kiev, Ukraine, April 4, 2016.Gleb Garanich/File PhotoDan Wasiolek, an analyst with Morningstar, said Wyndham's jump surprised him, though the company started at a lower base. He cited a $100 million revamping of its loyalty program eliminating blackout dates and other restrictions common to other chains' rewards programs.  Barry Goldstein, Wyndham's chief marketing officer, said in an interview that the loyalty program helped attract more travelers to Wyndham. He said the new rewards program helped drive direct bookings, as did making the chain's website and app more mobile-friendly. Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc and Marriott International Inc have also heavily promoted the linkage between loyalty rewards and direct bookings. Hilton's  Stop Clicking Around  advertising campaign, touted as its largest ever when it was launched in February 2016,  offered loyalty members a discount when booking directly from the hotel's website. Marriott created a similar campaign, also offering discounts to members who booked directly starting in April 2016. Loyalty programs allow hotel companies to circumvent the rate parity rule barring hotel companies from advertising lower rates on their sites than are available through the online agencies, Wasiolek said. But they present the risk of getting travelers to accustomed to discounted rates or free stays.

Surrounded by five empty podiums, Eliud Muthiora Kariara, a former banker turned running mate to independent presidential candidate Japhet Kavinga Kaluyu, answered questions posed by two moderators and the audience.  Why the other candidates were not present was unclear although some had already voiced objections to the debate format. Broadcasters had planned to have six minor candidates, including Kariara, take the stage first, with the front-runners from the two biggest parties facing off separately later.   A letter signed by the six and released on Sunday had said they intended to show up as long as all eight vice-presidential candidates would be debating simultaneously.  We made it clear that we shall take part at 8pm Debates that was to bring all candidates together,  Ekuru Aukot,  presidential candidate for Third Way Alliance, said on Twitter to explain why his running mate did not take part.     He also rejected reports in local media that some candidates had arrived late and not been allowed in.  This is documented. We arrived in time,  he said.  Kenya's current deputy president, William Ruto, said on Twitter that he had not been given details of the event.        I am surprised no one has engaged me on the debate. Courtesy demands that date, time, rules of engagement would have been made available,  Ruto tweeted on Sunday.     But Debate Media Limited, the alliance of broadcasters that organized the debate, said in a statement that all the campaigns had been informed. It noted that one minor candidate had even lodged a court case insisting he should share the podium with the two larger parties.   The suggestion that the campaigns did not know about these debates is therefore at best dishonest,  the statement said. Kenya will also choose legislators and local representatives in the Aug. 8 polls, which will see incumbent President Uhuru Kenyatta challenged by veteran opposition leader Raila Odinga, the head of the National Super Alliance (NASA).  Odinga also ran in 2007, when a disputed presidential poll sparked violence that killed 1,200 people, and in a peaceful election in 2013. Both major parties have published manifestos, although Kenyan voters have often split along ethnic lines in previous elections.      According to polling firm IPSOS, the ruling party and NASA are likely to take about 90 percent of the vote, while none of the six independent presidential candidates is polling above 1 percent. Vice-presidential candidate Kariara used his unexpected place in the spotlight on Monday to call for leadership  to take Kenya to the next level .   There has been so much talk. What Kenya needs is action,  he said. Reporting by George Obulutsa; Editing by Katharine Houreld and Catherine Evans","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-kenya-election-debate-idUSKBN1A3162"},

The $4 trillion blueprint would allow an overhaul of the U.S. tax code to pass Congress without support from Democrats, along with a partial repeal of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law and $203 billion in savings from mandatory federal programs including food stamps over the next decade. Those changes and others would be combined in a single piece of legislation. The prospect of reduced benefits for the poor and major tax cuts for businesses and individuals is already a source of infighting between House Republican conservatives who want larger spending reductions and moderates who oppose them. In the Senate, a similar Republican battle over the repeal of Obamacare taxes on the wealthy and reduced health insurance benefits for lower-income Americans has helped sink healthcare legislation. The spending plan, which covers the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, aims to move the government from a $472 billion deficit in 2018 to a $9 billion budget surplus in 2027. The change is based in part on a House Budget Committee forecast of U.S. economic growth of 2.6 percent annually that assumes future changes in tax, healthcare and financial laws, as well as deregulation. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has forecast economic growth of 1.9 percent from 2017 to 2027. The House budget plan would include $621.5 billion in defense spending and $511 billion on nondefense discretionary spending in 2018. The House Budget Committee is expected to approve the plan later this week and send it to the House floor for a full vote. The plan is vital to Republican aims of overhauling the U.S. tax code while avoiding a Democratic filibuster in the Senate. The plan instructs 11 House committees to find savings from programs and policies they oversee, including taxes, financial regulation, food stamps and federal pensions. The instructions would allow final legislation to pass the Senate with a simple majority through a parliamentary process know as reconciliation. Republicans control the Senate by a 52-48 margin. Without reconciliation, tax reform would require 60 Senate votes. (Editing by Sandra Maler and Jeffrey Benkoe)","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-congress-budget-idUSL3N1K93SX"},

On the 18th hole, in the final round, the then 17-year-old amateur, playing in his first major championship, chipped his wedge shot, from thick rough, into the hole for a birdie, producing what was described as one of the loudest roars ever heard on a course. It also left him with a final round 69 and a tie for fourth in his first ever appearance in a major championship -- although the scorecard that most impressed was arguably his second round of 66, the lowest in a day of extremely testing conditions which produced an average score of 74.7. The skinny teenager was expected to be the next great star of British golf but it did not work quite like that. After turning professional, Rose missed the cut in his first 21 events and although he gradually built up his form, reputation and ranking, it was not until the 2013 U.S. Open that he finally won a major. Curiously, though, in the British event he has yet to better that finish from 19 years ago, something he admits he finds puzzling.  There's no real reason for it. It's disappointing. I think maybe the expectation for a number of years afterwards took its toll coming back, trying to live up to it,  he said on Tuesday after practice at the links course.  I feel now, though, at this stage of my career I've somewhat proved that wasn't a flash in the pan, so I can come back to the Open a little freer than I could for a number of years,  he added.  I've had a few, I would say outside chances of very good weeks that I haven't quite capitalized upon in the past ... but obviously the record suggests it hasn't been very good since.  But I feel that I'm at a stage now where I can put all those past performances behind me and refocus on a good week,  he said. Rose certainly does not try to blot out his past, even re-creating the shot for an Instagram post last week, and he says he would love to recapture some of the spirit of his debut.  In some ways I look back and I try to model it, as well -- just the freedom I had that particular week, the confidence I had in my short game, the innocence in which I played the game, I think, is still a model. Playing With Freedom  I think that when I play my best golf I'm always trying to get rid of things, rather than add more -- get rid of thoughts rather than add thoughts.   When I looked at my performance here when I was 17 it was very much free, playing with freedom and using my natural ability. And obviously I had things going my way, too, that week.  But when I do look back I do marvel at how I was able to compete so closely down the stretch, and finished within two shots of winning an Open Championship at the age of 17.   I guess for me it was a glimpse into what my potential is. And hard work will create another chance here and there.

Despite or even because of Brexit, European integration remains one of the best ideas that Europeans had in the 20th century,  Schaeuble said in a letter, seen by Reuters on Tuesday and sent to lawmakers from Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives and the co-governing Social Democrats (SPD). Germany and France now had to work closely together and pull in the same direction to strengthen cooperation in the soon-to-be 27-member bloc, the veteran politician said, urging all euro zone governments to further implement structural reforms, reduce debt and make their budgets more sustainable.  Germany advocates a steady implementation of these (fiscal) agreements and is also ready to more effectively prevent future crises and further deepen the monetary union,  he said.  The rule for this is simple and convincing: To set the right incentives and avoid non-sustainable developments, risks and liabilities must be at the same level and in one hand.

Since losing the Conservatives' majority in parliament at an election she did not need to call, May has been increasingly unable to dictate to her ministers, who have begun to air their disagreements in public. Much of the criticism, briefed by anonymous sources in the British media, has centered on finance minister Philip Hammond, who has been attacked on his stance on government spending and his approach to Britain's departure from the European Union.  There is a need to show strength and unity as a country and that starts around the cabinet table,  May told her top team of ministers, according to her spokesman.  She said the government would make better decisions if colleagues were able to hold open discussions but it was vital that discussions in cabinet must remain private,  he told reporters.  The PM said the briefings and counter-briefings over the weekend had been a case of colleagues not taking their responsibilities seriously.  Hammond was quoted as saying he believed public sector workers were overpaid last week, a statement at odds with many in the cabinet who want to increase pay to try to win back voters and seized upon by the opposition Labour Party. Described as  an enfeebled chancellor  in parliament by a Labour lawmaker, Hammond said:  I don't know which planet he lives on but I have to tell you I don't feel particularly enfeebled.  Earlier Sky News said May, whose authority was shattered by last month's ill-judged election, had taken the floor at a summer party for Conservative lawmakers to tell them there should be  no backbiting, no carping .

International subscriber count of 52.03 million at the end of the June quarter eclipsed domestic customer numbers of 51.92 million, Netflix said on Monday. The company's shares were up 10.5 percent at $178.72 in Tuesday premarket trading, on track to add over $7 billion to Netflix's $70 billion market value. Morgan Stanley and JP Morgan - the two brokerages most bullish on Netflix's stock - each raised their price target to $210.  We believe the rapidly growing content offering led by originals that in aggregate garnered 91 Emmy nominations last week, drove the stronger new sign-ups,  Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a research note. This year, original TV shows  Stranger Things ,  The Crown  and the latest season of Kevin Spacey-starrer  House of Cards,  received Emmy nominations and brought in more customers than Netflix had predicted for the second quarter. The company, which has over 100 million customers globally, added 4.14 million monthly subscribers in international markets in the latest quarter, handsomely beating the average analyst estimate of 2.59 million, according to data from analytics firm FactSet. In the United States, it signed up 1.07 million subscribers, compared with analysts' expectations of 631,000. Netflix has often been criticized for spending too much on content as it tries to aggressively gain subscribers outside the United States. The company said earlier it planned to spend about $6 billion this year for original shows and expected to have negative free cash flow of $2 billion to $2.5 billion. But most analysts backed the company's strategy favoring scale over profit.  The company's content strategy continues to deliver results, and we liken Netflix's apparent mentality around cash flow (spend as much as makes sense within a modest cash burn and leverage framework) to Amazon's mentality around profit,  Canaccord Genuity analysts wrote in a broker note. At least 10 brokerages raised their price targets on Netflix. The median price target is $185. Of the 41 analysts covering Netflix's stock, 24 have a  buy  or higher rating. Fifteen have a  hold  rating and two a  sell  or lower. Netflix's shares had risen about 30 percent this year, upto Monday's close, versus a roughly 10 percent increase in the Nasdaq Composite.

Justine Damond's American fiance also wondered about the details of how she was shot. She had called the police to report a suspected sexual assault near her home, fiance Don Damond told reporters outside the home.  We lost the dearest of people and we are desperate for information,  Damond said.  Piecing together Justine's last moments before the homicide would be a small comfort as we grieve this tragedy.

Minneapolis Mayor Betsy Hodges and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Minnesota called for answers on why the two responding officers failed to turn on their body cameras when they arrived at Damond's home in a quiet, upper-middle-class neighborhood shortly before midnight on Saturday. Police shot Damond, originally from Sydney, through the door of their patrol car as she approached them in an alley near her home, the Minneapolis Star-Tribune reported, citing three unnamed sources. Minneapolis Police Chief Janee Harteau called Damond's death  tragic  in a statement on Monday and promised a  transparent  investigation. Damond's father, John Ruszczyk, told reporters in Sydney on Tuesday that her death was  our worst nightmare .  Justine was a beacon to all of us.

The statement did not describe Noor's role in the shooting, and authorities have not confirmed the identities of the officers involved.  He came to the United States at a young age and is thankful to have had so many opportunities,  Plunkett said of Noor, who was previously described by the city as a native of Somalia.  The current environment for police is difficult, but Officer Noor accepts this as part of his calling. We would like to say more and will in the future.  Slideshow (4 Images)Hundreds took to the streets of Minneapolis on Sunday to protest Damond's shooting. The state Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA), which reviews shootings involving the police in Minneapolis, said the dashboard camera in the officers' patrol car did not capture the shooting. The BCA is seeking any civilian video of the incident. The ACLU of Minnesota called for the release of the audio from Damond's 911 call, along with any audio from the officers' dash camera. The group's interim executive director, Teresa Nelson, said the officers failed to obey department rules by not having their body cameras on. Damond owned a meditation and life-coaching company, according to her personal website. Media gave her age as 40. Sarah Darmody, who said in a Facebook post that she had been friends with Damond since high school in Sydney, blamed the shooting on the gun laws in the United States, which has one of the highest rates of gun ownership in the world.  There is no good reason and there are no other countries in the world where people would rather arm everyone than stop this happening,  Darmody wrote.  I'm so sad and so angry I can't even breathe.  Both officers have been placed on administrative leave, the state BCA said. Minneapolis police referred further questions about the incident to the BCA.

K. Arora spent more than three years trudging through the Indian summer heat and monsoon rains to inspect tobacco kiosks across this sprawling megacity, tearing down cigarette advertisements and handing out fines to store owners for putting them up. But as fast as he removed the colorful ads, more appeared. The chief tobacco control officer at the Delhi state government, Arora asked the major cigarette companies to put a stop to the cat-and-mouse routine. In official letters and face-to-face meetings, he told them India's tobacco control laws barred such public advertising and promotion of cigarettes. That included the Indian arm of Philip Morris International Inc (PM.N), the world's largest publicly traded tobacco company. Early last year, Arora said, he met with a Philip Morris director for corporate affairs in India, a man named R. Venkatesh, and told him the signs were an unequivocal violation of Indian law. Like other tobacco companies, Philip Morris kept up its ad blitz. Venkatesh says Philip Morris is doing nothing wrong. In response to questions from Reuters, he said the company's advertising is  compliant with Indian law  and that Philip Morris has  fully cooperated with the enforcement authorities  on the matter. But Indian government officials say Philip Morris is using methods that flout the nation's tobacco-control regulations. These include tobacco shop displays as well as the free distribution of Marlboro – the world's best-selling cigarette brand – at nightclubs and bars frequented by young people. (See the web version of this story - reut.rs/2uuye5Y) In internal documents, Philip Morris International is explicit about targeting the country's youth. A key goal is  winning the hearts and minds of LA-24,  those between legal age, 18, and 24, according to one slide in a 2015 commercial review presentation. As with the point-of-sale ads at kiosks, public health officials say that giving away cigarettes is a violation of India's Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Act and its accompanying rules. Philip Morris' marketing strategy for India, which relies heavily on kiosk advertising and social events, is laid out in hundreds of pages of internal documents reviewed by Reuters that cover the period from 2009 to 2016. In them, Philip Morris presents these promotions as key marketing activities. In recent years, they have helped to more than quadruple Marlboro's market share in India, where the company is battling to expand its reach in the face of an entrenched local giant. Reuters is publishing a selection of those documents in a searchable repository, The Philip Morris Files. (reut.rs/2sT51xF) 'Within Walking Distance' The company's goal is to make sure that  every adult Indian smoker should be able to buy Marlboro within walking distance,  according to another 2015 strategy document. In targeting young adults, Philip Morris is deploying a promotional strategy that it and other tobacco companies used in the United States decades ago. A study published in the American Journal of Public Health in 2002 found that during the 1990s,  tobacco industry sponsorship of bars and nightclubs increased dramatically, accompanied by cigarette brand paraphernalia, advertisements, and entertainment events in bars and clubs.  With cigarette sales declining in many countries, Philip Morris has identified India, population 1.3 billion, as a market with opportunity for significant growth.  India remains a high potential market with huge upside with cigarette market still in infancy,  says a 2014 internal document. According to government data, India has about 100 million smokers. Of those, about two-thirds smoke traditional hand-rolled cigarettes. Tobacco use kills more than 900,000 people a year in India, and the World Health Organization estimates that tobacco-related diseases cost the country about $16 billion annually. Philip Morris is not alone in using marketing methods that Indian officials say are illegal. The country's largest cigarette maker, ITC Ltd (ITC.NS), uses similar tactics, such as advertising at kiosks. British American Tobacco Plc (BATS.L) and Indian state-run companies have large, passive stakes in ITC, which controls about 80 percent of the market. Tobacco-control officer Arora, a short, mustachioed man with a gruff demeanor, sent a letter to Philip Morris and other tobacco companies in mid-April, giving them until the end of the month to remove all advertisements.  Legal action will be initiated against the company  if it did not comply, he wrote in the letters, copies of which were reviewed by Reuters. Cigarette Raid A day after Arora's deadline passed, he and his team conducted a raid in an affluent area of cafes and coffee shops in New Delhi that showed his letters did not have the desired effect. On that hot afternoon in May, the team cut down about a dozen advertisements for Marlboro and various ITC brands. As word of the raid spread, worried vendors covered their ads with newspapers or took them down. One kiosk owner, Rakesh Kumar Jain, removed his Marlboro ads before Arora's team arrived. Jain said the signs had been put up by Philip Morris representatives. In return, he said, he received free cigarettes each month worth about 2,000 rupees (about $30). Jain knew that putting up the posters was illegal, but they helped improve sales, he said. About a dozen kiosk owners interviewed by Reuters said that tobacco companies paid them a monthly fee for advertisements and product displays, with the amount determined by factors such as location, volume of business and type of promotional material. In payment receipts seen by Reuters, Philip Morris' India unit promised to pay 500 Indian rupees ($7.50) a month to a cigarette seller with a small roadside kiosk in New Delhi for putting up Marlboro ads. The receipts were signed by a company representative. During the raid, fines were issued to some vendors, many of them repeat offenders, and they were threatened with court action if the ads went up again. Like Philip Morris, ITC says that it is in full compliance with India's 2003 tobacco control law. If it wasn't, the company said in a statement to Reuters, then  the relevant government authorities would have initiated action.  Since Arora's threat of legal action in April, there are fewer Philip Morris advertisements outside cigarette shops in the capital. But both Philip Morris and ITC say that advertising inside a shop is allowed.  Advertisements of tobacco products at the entrance and inside the shops selling tobacco products are clearly and categorically permitted,  ITC said in response to questions from Reuters. Arora, however, said all advertising is prohibited -  There are no two ways about it,  he insisted - but he can't start legal proceedings until getting further guidance from the federal government. He has yet to receive an answer. S.K. Arora, chief tobacco control officer of Delhi's stae goverment, poses for a photogrph next to an anti-tobacco sign pasted on a school wall alongside a road in New Delhi, India, April 13, 2017.Adnan AbidiFederal health officials say in interviews that the ads are out of bounds. Amal Pusp, a director for tobacco control at the health ministry, told Reuters that  there is no confusion : All advertisements - inside and outside shops - are illegal. 'Innocent Minds' The 2003 law allows tobacco companies to advertise at shops, but subsequent rules issued by the government prohibit it. In 2004, India became one of the first countries to ratify the World Health Organization's Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) treaty. The pact has 181 members and contains a raft of anti-smoking provisions, including tobacco taxes, warning labels on cigarette packs and advertising bans. The country enacted its national tobacco control law the year before ratifying the FCTC, and since then the government has added rules to strengthen the law in line with FCTC treaty provisions. The health ministry published rules in 2005 that banned any display of brand names, pack images or promotional messages. The rule specified that tobacco retailers could only display a 60-by-45 centimeter board, roughly 24 by 18 inches. The sign can have a description of the type of tobacco products sold – such as cigarettes or chewing tobacco – but cannot include any brand advertising and must carry a large health warning. The health ministry's rules were challenged in court by a group of cigarette distributors and put on hold by a state-level High Court for seven years. They finally came into force in 2013 on orders of India's Supreme Court. The High Court had overlooked the fact that advertisement of tobacco products  will attract younger generation and innocent minds, who are not aware of grave and adverse consequences of consuming such products,  the Supreme Court said in its ruling. Philip Morris has lobbied against the passing of stricter tobacco control rules by the Indian government. In documents detailing the company's plans for the biennial FCTC treaty convention in India last November, Prime Minister Narendra Modi emerges as a prime target. A key goal: to pre-empt Modi from taking  extreme anti-tobacco measures  before delegates were to gather from around the world for the treaty meeting, according to a 2014 corporate affairs PowerPoint presentation. The company planned to gain Modi's ear through those close to him. It identified several people in this group, including Commerce Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, Health Minister Jagat Prakash Nadda, and Amit Shah, president of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party. Slideshow (9 Images)Modi and the other politicians didn't respond to requests for comment. Philip Morris International also didn't comment on the plan. Marlboro Parties The tobacco giant's efforts to fend off anti-smoking steps have had limited impact so far. Last year, for instance, India ordered manufacturers to cover 85 percent of the surface of cigarette packs with health warnings, up from 20 percent. The rule, which is still being challenged in a state court by the tobacco industry, including Philip Morris' India partner, was implemented by order of the Supreme Court. Marlboro has just a 1.4 percent share of the almost $10 billion cigarette market in India. The industry is dominated by ITC, which has a strong grip on distributors and retailers. One major method Philip Morris is deploying to gain ground, the marketing documents show, is the free distribution of cigarettes at bars and nightclubs - known as Legal Age Meeting Points, or LAMPs, in company jargon. The hiring of young women and men to work at these gatherings is outsourced to event management companies, according to people with knowledge of the gatherings. Some of the recruiting takes place online.  Hey girls…We are searching A++ Hot & Gorgeous girls for the Marlboro pub activity...Pay: 2000/day...Work: Promotion in clubs in Delhi,  read one post on a Facebook public group in June last year. There was no company name attached to the ad. At several parties attended by Reuters in Delhi and Mumbai, young women dressed in the colors of the latest Marlboro variant handed out packs of cigarettes. During one party at a nightclub in a Delhi hotel, a young woman walked around with a tablet showing an ad that highlighted Marlboro features. A television screen played a video promoting the brand:  For trendsetters, for forward thinkers, a smooth and balanced smoking experience.  In many ways, it was right out of the Philip Morris 1990s playbook. The American Journal of Public Health study, drawing on previously secret industry documents, found that Philip Morris ran bar promotions in 1990 using racing jackets, and added  neon message boards and cocktail trays  in 1991. The study described methods for collecting names for a company database  to generate smoker profiles, direct mailing campaigns, and conduct telephone research studies after the bar events.  At the parties in India, people who took the Marlboro packs were asked their names, ages and preferred brands. Philip Morris calls this distribution of free cigarettes  sampling,  which it says in an internal document is allowed under the law. Brief Respite The company has spent millions of dollars on these activities. In 2014, for example, Philip Morris estimated it spent $1.6 million on LAMP events and sampling at kiosks in India, according to the 2015 commercial review presentation. The company planned to use LAMPs in 2015 to generate 30,000  trials,  or samplings of cigarettes. And it planned to generate another 500,000 trials that year through sampling at cigarette shops and kiosks, according to the 2015 strategy document. The company instructs employees to watch their words. An undated training manual for market researchers says:  Do not say this is a 'PROMOTION' or 'ADVERTISING'.  Indian health ministry officials say that anyone who hands out free cigarettes, whatever the circumstances, is breaking the law. The Health Ministry's Amal Pusp says the law against distribution of free cigarettes is unambiguous. He cites Section 5 of the country's tobacco control act, which says:  No person, shall, under a contract or otherwise promote or agree to promote the use or consumption of  cigarettes or any other tobacco product. The law carries a fine of up to 1,000 rupees (about $15) and a sentence of up to two years in prison for a first conviction.  We believe we market our products in a responsible manner, and in compliance with Indian regulations,  Philip Morris' Venkatesh said, without elaborating. In October last year, the month before India was due to host delegations from around the world at the biennial FCTC tobacco control conference in Delhi, tobacco-control officer Arora said he suddenly started getting traction. The cigarette ads vanished and Delhi was  cleaned,  he said. That success couldn't have come at a better time for Arora and his colleagues at the federal health ministry: They wanted to make sure foreign delegates visiting India saw the country was serious about its tobacco regulations. Weeks after the FCTC delegates left town in November, however, kiosks in the capital were again displaying ads for Marlboro. Reporting Aditya Kalra, Paritosh Bansal, Tom Lasseter and Duff Wilson.

Surrounded by five empty podiums, Eliud Muthiora Kariara, a former banker turned running mate to independent presidential candidate Japhet Kavinga Kaluyu, answered questions posed by two moderators and the audience.  Why the other candidates were not present was unclear although some had already voiced objections to the debate format. Broadcasters had planned to have six minor candidates, including Kariara, take the stage first, with the front-runners from the two biggest parties facing off separately later.   A letter signed by the six and released on Sunday had said they intended to show up as long as all eight vice-presidential candidates would be debating simultaneously.  We made it clear that we shall take part at 8pm Debates that was to bring all candidates together,  Ekuru Aukot,  presidential candidate for Third Way Alliance, said on Twitter to explain why his running mate did not take part.     He also rejected reports in local media that some candidates had arrived late and not been allowed in.  This is documented. We arrived in time,  he said.  Kenya's current deputy president, William Ruto, said on Twitter that he had not been given details of the event.        I am surprised no one has engaged me on the debate. Courtesy demands that date, time, rules of engagement would have been made available,  Ruto tweeted on Sunday.     But Debate Media Limited, the alliance of broadcasters that organized the debate, said in a statement that all the campaigns had been informed. It noted that one minor candidate had even lodged a court case insisting he should share the podium with the two larger parties.   The suggestion that the campaigns did not know about these debates is therefore at best dishonest,  the statement said. Kenya will also choose legislators and local representatives in the Aug. 8 polls, which will see incumbent President Uhuru Kenyatta challenged by veteran opposition leader Raila Odinga, the head of the National Super Alliance (NASA).  Odinga also ran in 2007, when a disputed presidential poll sparked violence that killed 1,200 people, and in a peaceful election in 2013. Both major parties have published manifestos, although Kenyan voters have often split along ethnic lines in previous elections.      According to polling firm IPSOS, the ruling party and NASA are likely to take about 90 percent of the vote, while none of the six independent presidential candidates is polling above 1 percent. Vice-presidential candidate Kariara used his unexpected place in the spotlight on Monday to call for leadership  to take Kenya to the next level .   There has been so much talk.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in November banned 500 rupee ($7.77) and 1,000 rupee bank notes as part of a drive against unaccounted wealth in India that has also hit Nepal where Indian rupees are widely used. People holding the notes in India were given a little less than two months to exchange them at banks. In March, officials from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) visited Nepal and promised to allow every Nepali citizen to exchange 4,500 Indian rupees ($70) worth of the old notes for new ones.  That was only a verbal assurance but no formal decision from India has come to us,  said Chinta Mani Shivakoti, a deputy governor of the central Nepal Rastra Bank.  Even if this amount was exchanged, individuals holding more than 4,500 Indian rupees risk losing the excess,  Shivakoti said. Nepal depends heavily on funds from workers in India, who sent home $640 million in 2016, or about 3 percent of its gross domestic product. The Indian central bank declined to comment. An Indian finance ministry spokesman also declined to comment, saying it was a central bank matter. India fears that if it agrees to Nepal's demand to allow Nepalis to exchange unlimited amounts, a large number of Indians may launder their ill-gotten old notes through Nepal. Shivakoti said Nepal's banks hold 78.5 million Indian rupees worth of the old notes, while business officials estimate that up to 10 billion in old Indian rupees ($155 million) may be held by individuals in Nepal's informal sector. Another NRB official, Bhisma Raj Dhungana, said the delay in resolving the issue was causing concern.  India should have allowed the exchange facility much earlier,  Dhungana said. Ordinary Nepalis say they have been hit badly by the delay.  My savings are worth no more than waste papers.

Since losing the Conservatives' majority in parliament at an election she did not need to call, May has been increasingly unable to dictate to her ministers, who have begun to air their disagreements in public. Much of the criticism, briefed by anonymous sources in the British media, has centered on finance minister Philip Hammond, who has been attacked on his stance on government spending and his approach to Britain's departure from the European Union.  There is a need to show strength and unity as a country and that starts around the cabinet table,  May told her top team of ministers, according to her spokesman.  She said the government would make better decisions if colleagues were able to hold open discussions but it was vital that discussions in cabinet must remain private,  he told reporters.  The PM said the briefings and counter-briefings over the weekend had been a case of colleagues not taking their responsibilities seriously.  Hammond was quoted as saying he believed public sector workers were overpaid last week, a statement at odds with many in the cabinet who want to increase pay to try to win back voters and seized upon by the opposition Labour Party. Described as  an enfeebled chancellor  in parliament by a Labour lawmaker, Hammond said:  I don't know which planet he lives on but I have to tell you I don't feel particularly enfeebled.  Earlier Sky News said May, whose authority was shattered by last month's ill-judged election, had taken the floor at a summer party for Conservative lawmakers to tell them there should be  no backbiting, no carping .  The choice is me or Jeremy Corbyn – and nobody wants him,  May told her lawmakers, according to the Daily Mail newspaper.

The move would be part of a wider plan to promote EU public and private spending on clean energy and other green industries. The European Commission estimates that Europe will need 180 billion euros ($207 billion) in additional investment every year in the next two decades if it wants to achieve its goal of curbing global warming. Clearer classification and common labels for green financial products are expected to boost environment-friendly markets and help curb  greenwashing , a practice whereby companies and other organizations claim to be  greener  than they really are. The EU Commission's vice president Valdis Dombrovskis said the decision of President Donald Trump to pull the United States out of the 2015 Paris global accord on fighting climate change would create new opportunities for Europe.  (Improved labelling) will provide the confidence and trust in sustainable and green products needed for investors to fund the transition to the low-carbon economy,  he told a conference on Tuesday. The Commission will make proposals early next year on how to foster financial markets' shift towards greener products, he added.  The European Investment Bank, the EU's financial arm, has pledged to maintain a target of investing around 20 billion dollars a year to fight climate change over the next five years, which would make it the largest contributor among multilateral institutions. But private funding is also crucial to boost the sector. The lack of commonly agreed labels and standards for green financial products has so far hampered market development, according to a report prepared by an EU expert group on sustainable finance. Green funds had around €145 billion of assets under management in 2016, against €3.1 trillion invested in European bonds and €3.4 trillion in equity funds, the report said. Classification in green bonds is predicted to nearly double its global value to 131 billion euros this year, Dombrovskis sad, despite the continued absence of a European standard for such products which could further fuel their expansion. The expert group's report said clearer definitions of green credentials should also be used for equity funds and other assets to favor investors' decisions and match global targets to reduce climate change.  The group will present by the end of the year a more comprehensive assessment of the regulatory changes needed at EU level to boost sustainable finance.

Ericsson shares fell more than 11 percent to 54.20 crowns by 1110 GMT, with the figures fuelling concerns that plans by CEO Borje Ekholm, who took charge in January, will not be enough to restore profitability. The company is facing mounting competition from China's Huawei [HWT.UL] and Finland's Nokia as well as weak emerging markets and falling spending by telecoms operators with demand for next-generation 5G technology still years away. Ericsson has responded by cutting jobs and costs but those efforts are yet to stop the rot.  We are in a phase of turnaround but it's going to take some time,  Ekholm said on Tuesday, repeating the firm was on course to double 2016 margins after 2018. Operating loss in the second quarter was 1.2 billion Swedish crowns ($145.3 million), compared with a 2.8 billion profit a year earlier and a mean forecast for a 244 million crown loss seen in a Reuters poll of analysts. Ekholm's strategy to stabilize the business includes exploring options for its loss-making media arm and reviewing unprofitable managed services and network rollout contracts.  We see a more challenging investment environment in Europe and Latin America, that's clearly the market area with the biggest impact,  Ekholm added.  We see macro economic uncertainty in Middle East and Africa that is hurting investment. We see also that operators have funneled the investments more into fiber investments for example than into radio capacity.  The company, backed by prominent Wallenberg family-backed Investor AB and Industrivarden, said it was targeting cost cutting to achieve an annual run rate reduction of at least 10 billion crowns by mid-2018. The exterior of an Ericsson building is seen in Stockholm April 30, 2009.Bob Strong/File PhotoMarket Decline Ericsson stunned investors earlier this year by announcing $1.7 billion in provisions, writedowns and restructuring costs. Moody's cut the company's credit rating to junk in May, partly due to worries that the cost-cutting could hamper innovation. Adding to the sense of gloom, Ericsson said it now sees the mobile infrastructure market falling by a high single-digit percentage this year, compared to its earlier guidance of a 2-6 percent decline.  Ericsson doesn't deliver, they lose versus the market and the market is weak,  said Inge Heydorn, fund manager at Sentat Asset Management, which has no position in Ericsson shares. In 2018 it expects the mobile infrastructure market to fall by a low single digit percentage and to flatten out in 2019, CFO Carl Mellander told Reuters. Sales at Ericsson, one of the top global mobile networks equipment makers, were 49.9 billion crowns below a consensus forecast of 50.5 billion, while the gross margin came in at 27.9 percent versus the 28.4 percent seen by analysts. Operating profit in the Networks segment almost halved to 2.6 billion crowns in the second quarter, while both IT & Cloud and the media segments posted higher losses versus a year ago. It had a net cash position of 24 billion crowns by the end of June, down from 28 billion at the end of March.

But Dana believes a stay on proceedings in the emirate of Sharjah will still permit it to resume its legal action there, if it wishes, after a London hearing scheduled for September, the source said on Tuesday. The case is being closely watched by the Islamic finance industry around the world because it could affect the structuring and pricing of future issues by other companies. Holders of the sukuk, which Abu Dhabi-listed Dana wants to restructure on the grounds that changes in Islamic finance since they were issued four years ago have made the bonds unlawful in the UAE, have fought the company in the London High Court.  These cases raise serious and complex legal issues which include the applicability of different legal jurisdictions. The ultimate answer will only be known after both the UK and the UAE proceedings have reached their final outcome,” the source said. Dana said this week that it remained keen to engage with holders of the sukuk and reach a restructuring agreement. Last month it applied to the Sharjah Federal Court of First Instance to have the sukuk declared unlawful, and obtained an injunction blocking claims for payments pending a ruling. But a judge at London's High Court said this month he would hold a full hearing on the case in September and upheld an interim High Court injunction blocking holders of the bonds from enforcing claims against Dana, while also ordering it to cancel the Sharjah injunction and seek a stay of proceedings there. Although the purchase undertaking for the original sukuk is governed by English law, the validity of the mudaraba agreement underlying the sukuk will be determined in the UAE, the source said. Mudaraba is a structure that resembles an investment management partnership and Dana argues this has become obsolete.

K. Arora spent more than three years trudging through the Indian summer heat and monsoon rains to inspect tobacco kiosks across this sprawling megacity, tearing down cigarette advertisements and handing out fines to store owners for putting them up. But as fast as he removed the colorful ads, more appeared. The chief tobacco control officer at the Delhi state government, Arora asked the major cigarette companies to put a stop to the cat-and-mouse routine. In official letters and face-to-face meetings, he told them India's tobacco control laws barred such public advertising and promotion of cigarettes. That included the Indian arm of Philip Morris International Inc (PM.N), the world's largest publicly traded tobacco company. Early last year, Arora said, he met with a Philip Morris director for corporate affairs in India, a man named R. Venkatesh, and told him the signs were an unequivocal violation of Indian law. Like other tobacco companies, Philip Morris kept up its ad blitz. Venkatesh says Philip Morris is doing nothing wrong. In response to questions from Reuters, he said the company's advertising is  compliant with Indian law  and that Philip Morris has  fully cooperated with the enforcement authorities  on the matter. But Indian government officials say Philip Morris is using methods that flout the nation's tobacco-control regulations. These include tobacco shop displays as well as the free distribution of Marlboro – the world's best-selling cigarette brand – at nightclubs and bars frequented by young people. (See the web version of this story - reut.rs/2uuye5Y) In internal documents, Philip Morris International is explicit about targeting the country's youth. A key goal is  winning the hearts and minds of LA-24,  those between legal age, 18, and 24, according to one slide in a 2015 commercial review presentation. As with the point-of-sale ads at kiosks, public health officials say that giving away cigarettes is a violation of India's Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Act and its accompanying rules. Philip Morris' marketing strategy for India, which relies heavily on kiosk advertising and social events, is laid out in hundreds of pages of internal documents reviewed by Reuters that cover the period from 2009 to 2016. In them, Philip Morris presents these promotions as key marketing activities. In recent years, they have helped to more than quadruple Marlboro's market share in India, where the company is battling to expand its reach in the face of an entrenched local giant. Reuters is publishing a selection of those documents in a searchable repository, The Philip Morris Files. (reut.rs/2sT51xF) 'Within Walking Distance' The company's goal is to make sure that  every adult Indian smoker should be able to buy Marlboro within walking distance,  according to another 2015 strategy document. In targeting young adults, Philip Morris is deploying a promotional strategy that it and other tobacco companies used in the United States decades ago. A study published in the American Journal of Public Health in 2002 found that during the 1990s,  tobacco industry sponsorship of bars and nightclubs increased dramatically, accompanied by cigarette brand paraphernalia, advertisements, and entertainment events in bars and clubs.  With cigarette sales declining in many countries, Philip Morris has identified India, population 1.3 billion, as a market with opportunity for significant growth.  India remains a high potential market with huge upside with cigarette market still in infancy,  says a 2014 internal document. According to government data, India has about 100 million smokers. Of those, about two-thirds smoke traditional hand-rolled cigarettes. Tobacco use kills more than 900,000 people a year in India, and the World Health Organization estimates that tobacco-related diseases cost the country about $16 billion annually. Philip Morris is not alone in using marketing methods that Indian officials say are illegal. The country's largest cigarette maker, ITC Ltd (ITC.NS), uses similar tactics, such as advertising at kiosks. British American Tobacco Plc (BATS.L) and Indian state-run companies have large, passive stakes in ITC, which controls about 80 percent of the market. Tobacco-control officer Arora, a short, mustachioed man with a gruff demeanor, sent a letter to Philip Morris and other tobacco companies in mid-April, giving them until the end of the month to remove all advertisements.  Legal action will be initiated against the company  if it did not comply, he wrote in the letters, copies of which were reviewed by Reuters. Cigarette Raid A day after Arora's deadline passed, he and his team conducted a raid in an affluent area of cafes and coffee shops in New Delhi that showed his letters did not have the desired effect. On that hot afternoon in May, the team cut down about a dozen advertisements for Marlboro and various ITC brands. As word of the raid spread, worried vendors covered their ads with newspapers or took them down. One kiosk owner, Rakesh Kumar Jain, removed his Marlboro ads before Arora's team arrived. Jain said the signs had been put up by Philip Morris representatives. In return, he said, he received free cigarettes each month worth about 2,000 rupees (about $30). Jain knew that putting up the posters was illegal, but they helped improve sales, he said. About a dozen kiosk owners interviewed by Reuters said that tobacco companies paid them a monthly fee for advertisements and product displays, with the amount determined by factors such as location, volume of business and type of promotional material. In payment receipts seen by Reuters, Philip Morris' India unit promised to pay 500 Indian rupees ($7.50) a month to a cigarette seller with a small roadside kiosk in New Delhi for putting up Marlboro ads. The receipts were signed by a company representative. During the raid, fines were issued to some vendors, many of them repeat offenders, and they were threatened with court action if the ads went up again. Like Philip Morris, ITC says that it is in full compliance with India's 2003 tobacco control law. If it wasn't, the company said in a statement to Reuters, then  the relevant government authorities would have initiated action.  Since Arora's threat of legal action in April, there are fewer Philip Morris advertisements outside cigarette shops in the capital. But both Philip Morris and ITC say that advertising inside a shop is allowed.  Advertisements of tobacco products at the entrance and inside the shops selling tobacco products are clearly and categorically permitted,  ITC said in response to questions from Reuters. Arora, however, said all advertising is prohibited -  There are no two ways about it,  he insisted - but he can't start legal proceedings until getting further guidance from the federal government. He has yet to receive an answer. S.K. Arora, chief tobacco control officer of Delhi's stae goverment, poses for a photogrph next to an anti-tobacco sign pasted on a school wall alongside a road in New Delhi, India, April 13, 2017.Adnan AbidiFederal health officials say in interviews that the ads are out of bounds. Amal Pusp, a director for tobacco control at the health ministry, told Reuters that  there is no confusion : All advertisements - inside and outside shops - are illegal. 'Innocent Minds' The 2003 law allows tobacco companies to advertise at shops, but subsequent rules issued by the government prohibit it. In 2004, India became one of the first countries to ratify the World Health Organization's Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) treaty. The pact has 181 members and contains a raft of anti-smoking provisions, including tobacco taxes, warning labels on cigarette packs and advertising bans. The country enacted its national tobacco control law the year before ratifying the FCTC, and since then the government has added rules to strengthen the law in line with FCTC treaty provisions. The health ministry published rules in 2005 that banned any display of brand names, pack images or promotional messages. The rule specified that tobacco retailers could only display a 60-by-45 centimeter board, roughly 24 by 18 inches. The sign can have a description of the type of tobacco products sold – such as cigarettes or chewing tobacco – but cannot include any brand advertising and must carry a large health warning. The health ministry's rules were challenged in court by a group of cigarette distributors and put on hold by a state-level High Court for seven years. They finally came into force in 2013 on orders of India's Supreme Court. The High Court had overlooked the fact that advertisement of tobacco products  will attract younger generation and innocent minds, who are not aware of grave and adverse consequences of consuming such products,  the Supreme Court said in its ruling. Philip Morris has lobbied against the passing of stricter tobacco control rules by the Indian government. In documents detailing the company's plans for the biennial FCTC treaty convention in India last November, Prime Minister Narendra Modi emerges as a prime target. A key goal: to pre-empt Modi from taking  extreme anti-tobacco measures  before delegates were to gather from around the world for the treaty meeting, according to a 2014 corporate affairs PowerPoint presentation. The company planned to gain Modi's ear through those close to him. It identified several people in this group, including Commerce Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, Health Minister Jagat Prakash Nadda, and Amit Shah, president of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party. Slideshow (9 Images)Modi and the other politicians didn't respond to requests for comment. Philip Morris International also didn't comment on the plan. Marlboro Parties The tobacco giant's efforts to fend off anti-smoking steps have had limited impact so far. Last year, for instance, India ordered manufacturers to cover 85 percent of the surface of cigarette packs with health warnings, up from 20 percent. The rule, which is still being challenged in a state court by the tobacco industry, including Philip Morris' India partner, was implemented by order of the Supreme Court. Marlboro has just a 1.4 percent share of the almost $10 billion cigarette market in India. The industry is dominated by ITC, which has a strong grip on distributors and retailers. One major method Philip Morris is deploying to gain ground, the marketing documents show, is the free distribution of cigarettes at bars and nightclubs - known as Legal Age Meeting Points, or LAMPs, in company jargon. The hiring of young women and men to work at these gatherings is outsourced to event management companies, according to people with knowledge of the gatherings. Some of the recruiting takes place online.  Hey girls…We are searching A++ Hot & Gorgeous girls for the Marlboro pub activity...Pay: 2000/day...Work: Promotion in clubs in Delhi,  read one post on a Facebook public group in June last year. There was no company name attached to the ad. At several parties attended by Reuters in Delhi and Mumbai, young women dressed in the colors of the latest Marlboro variant handed out packs of cigarettes. During one party at a nightclub in a Delhi hotel, a young woman walked around with a tablet showing an ad that highlighted Marlboro features. A television screen played a video promoting the brand:  For trendsetters, for forward thinkers, a smooth and balanced smoking experience.  In many ways, it was right out of the Philip Morris 1990s playbook. The American Journal of Public Health study, drawing on previously secret industry documents, found that Philip Morris ran bar promotions in 1990 using racing jackets, and added  neon message boards and cocktail trays  in 1991. The study described methods for collecting names for a company database  to generate smoker profiles, direct mailing campaigns, and conduct telephone research studies after the bar events.  At the parties in India, people who took the Marlboro packs were asked their names, ages and preferred brands. Philip Morris calls this distribution of free cigarettes  sampling,  which it says in an internal document is allowed under the law. Brief Respite The company has spent millions of dollars on these activities. In 2014, for example, Philip Morris estimated it spent $1.6 million on LAMP events and sampling at kiosks in India, according to the 2015 commercial review presentation. The company planned to use LAMPs in 2015 to generate 30,000  trials,  or samplings of cigarettes. And it planned to generate another 500,000 trials that year through sampling at cigarette shops and kiosks, according to the 2015 strategy document. The company instructs employees to watch their words. An undated training manual for market researchers says:  Do not say this is a 'PROMOTION' or 'ADVERTISING'.  Indian health ministry officials say that anyone who hands out free cigarettes, whatever the circumstances, is breaking the law. The Health Ministry's Amal Pusp says the law against distribution of free cigarettes is unambiguous. He cites Section 5 of the country's tobacco control act, which says:  No person, shall, under a contract or otherwise promote or agree to promote the use or consumption of  cigarettes or any other tobacco product. The law carries a fine of up to 1,000 rupees (about $15) and a sentence of up to two years in prison for a first conviction.  We believe we market our products in a responsible manner, and in compliance with Indian regulations,  Philip Morris' Venkatesh said, without elaborating. In October last year, the month before India was due to host delegations from around the world at the biennial FCTC tobacco control conference in Delhi, tobacco-control officer Arora said he suddenly started getting traction. The cigarette ads vanished and Delhi was  cleaned,  he said. That success couldn't have come at a better time for Arora and his colleagues at the federal health ministry: They wanted to make sure foreign delegates visiting India saw the country was serious about its tobacco regulations. Weeks after the FCTC delegates left town in November, however, kiosks in the capital were again displaying ads for Marlboro. Reporting Aditya Kalra, Paritosh Bansal, Tom Lasseter and Duff Wilson.

Shares of UnitedHealth Group rose 1.8 percent in premarket trading after the largest U.S. health insurer's quarterly profit beat expectations and it raised its earnings forecast. Johnson and Johnson rose 1 percent after the pharma company's quarterly revenue grew from a year ago. The healthcare sector will be under scrutiny after the Republican healthcare bill to replace Obamacare hit yet another snag with news that two Republican senators would not support the latest version of the bill. This could mean that President Donald Trump's policies on tax reform and infrastructure spending will be further delayed. News on the healthcare bill sent the U.S. dollar to a 10-month low against a basket of major currencies. As earnings season gets under way, the market will be keeping a close eye on corporate results to see if the high valuations are justified in the face of mixed economic data and tepid inflation. Analysts' are estimating an 8.2 percent rise in second-quarter earnings for the S&P; 500 companies from a year earlier. This follows a robust first quarter when U.S. companies posted their best earnings since 2011, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The S&P; 500 has been trading at about 18 times earnings estimates for the next 12 months, compared with the long-term average of 15 times. IBM, United Continental Holdings, CSX and Navient are among the companies scheduled to report results after the bell. The U.S. Labor Department is expected to report that import prices fell 0.2 percent in June after sliding 0.3 percent in May, while export prices may be flat in June after falling 0.7 percent in May. The data is expected at 8:30 a.m. ET (1230 GMT). Netflix jumped 11 percent after the streaming-television pioneer's added more subscribers than expected in the second quarter. Bank of America slipped 0.6 percent despite the lender posting a growth in quarterly profit. Shares of JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Citigroup had taken a beating last week as their quarterly results and forecasts failed to excite investors. Harley-Davidson fell 3.6 percent after the motorcycle maker cut its 2017 shipments forecast.

The radio syllabus is providing lessons on literacy and numeracy, and staying safe amid the violence, to about 200,000 displaced and out-of-school children in the Far North region of Cameroon and Niger's southern Diffa region, according to UNICEF.  The level of boredom among children in camps for the displaced is tremendous,  said UNICEF spokesman Patrick Rose.  With this radio education program, children will receive lessons in a structured way, that keeps them in a rhythm ... so that when they go back to school they won't be so far behind,  Rose told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone from Dakar. Boko Haram, whose name loosely means 'Western education is sinful', has killed more than 600 teachers and forced over 1,200 schools to close during its eight-year insurgency in Nigeria, Niger, Cameroon and Chad, according to the U.N. agency. Three years ago, the abduction of more than 200 schoolgirls by the jihadist group in Chibok in northeastern Nigeria sparked global outrage a celebrity-backed campaign #bringbackourgirls. The project - backed by the European Union and governments of Cameroon and Niger - is engaging community leaders to share available radios and bring children together for the lessons. About 150 lessons are being broadcast in both French and the local languages of Kanouri, Fulfulde and Hausa, UNICEF said.  In the very near future, we hope that children who learn by radio will also receive a certification and pass the school year,  said Marie-Pierre Poirier, UNICEF's regional director.  Beyond radio broadcasts, school teachers across the region have been trained by UNICEF to identify and respond to security threats to protect children from Boko Haram, and to provide traumatized children with psychological support. Boko Haram has killed more than 20,000 people and some 2.7 million people have been uprooted from their homes since 2009 as a result of the group's attempt to create an Islamic state. The militants have been driven out of most of the territory they held in early 2015, yet continue to carry out bombings and raids in northeast Nigeria, as well as in Cameroon and Niger.

Rural women at the forefront of issues related to land, environment and natural resources are particularly at risk, excluded from public consultations and decision-making, and denied adequate protection, it said. Women human rights defenders (WHRD) opposing land confiscation, forced evictions, unfair land distribution, the development of extractive industries and environmental damage  have been met with extreme, and sometimes, deadly violence .  The government has failed to ensure that WHRDs are able to access justice and receive protection from harassment, threats, retaliation, and violence,  said the report from advocacy groups the Observatory, Protection International and the Asia Pacific Forum on Women, Law and Development. Government officials have said firm measures are necessary to ensure stability and order, and that they are only aimed at those who stir up violence. Since Thailand's military seized power in the 2014 coup, rural women, in particular, have increasingly been targeted by local authorities while trying to protect their land. Judicial harassment is being used against rural WHRDs, and authorities have also failed to conduct  prompt, impartial, and thorough investigations  into cases of extrajudicial killings of WHRDs, the report said. A number of policies on forestry and environmental protection are in place, and  relevant laws and measures are implemented through a fair and transparent process , the government said in a statement in response to the rights groups. But the report said the Thai government uses existing and newly introduced laws to restrict and criminalize the work of women activists, while a system of  institutionalized discrimination  makes women vulnerable. Members of the ruling junta are all men, and they directly appoint members to the executive and legislative bodies. Women make up only a small percentage of these. A new constitution, which came into effect in April, also fails to ensure equal rights for women in the political system, the report said. The junta has long come under fire from the international community for rights restrictions and crackdowns on dissidents. Earlier this year, rights groups said Thailand failed to address international concerns about the military government's obligation to uphold civil and political rights at a U.N. review in Geneva.

The region of 22 million people, which has a history of separatist and Marxist rebellion, was placed under military rule on May 23 after rebels from the Maute and Abu Sayyaf groups took over parts of Marawi City, plunging the Philippines into its biggest security crisis in years. Insurgents have put up fierce resistance, with scores of fighters still holed up in central Marawi after 57 days of government ground offensives, air strikes and artillery bombardments, in a battle authorities say has killed 413 militants, 98 members of the security forces and 45 civilians.   The primary objective of the possible extension is to allow our forces to continue with their operations unhampered by deadlines and to focus more on the liberation of Marawi and its rehabilitation and rebuilding,  said presidential spokesman Ernesto Abella, reading a letter signed by Duterte. A hardcore of gunmen were on Tuesday clinging on to positions in a deserted commercial heart, which has been reduced to rubble by a bombing campaign that has angered residents with no homes or businesses to return to. Duterte has appointed a taskforce to rebuild Marawi, with a 20 billion peso ($394.81 million) budget. The brazen assault by organized, heavily armed militants who have pledged allegiance to Islamic State has fanned fears that extremists may have radicalized and recruited more fighters than was previously thought. The Marawi siege is the fourth battle between the Maute clan and the military over the past nine months and the country's defense minister, Delfin Lorenzana, has admitted the combat and planning capability of the enemy has been underestimated. Lorenzana on Tuesday met Singaporean counterpart Ng Eng Hen, who offered the Philippines urban warfare training and use of surveillance aircraft to locate militants, adding to reconnaissance support Australia and the United States is currently providing. Duterte has long warned that Mindanao faced contamination by Islamic State, and experts say Muslim parts of the predominantly Catholic southern Philippines are fertile ground for expansion due to their history of marginalization and neglect. Big Problem Activists display placards calling for lifting of martial law in the southern Philippines, as Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has asked the Philippine Congress to extend the implementation of martial law in the island of Mindanao until the end of the year, to allow the armed forces to quell Islamist militancy in parts of the southern island, during a protest outside the presidential palace in Manila, Philippines July 18, 2017.Romeo RanocoWhile few dispute that Duterte has a serious problem on his hands, his critics have derided his declaration of martial law across all of Mindanao, an area the size of South Korea. Martial law allows for deeper surveillance and arrests without warrant, giving security forces a freer rein to go after suspected extremist financiers and facilitators. According to several senate and congress leaders who dined with the president on Monday evening, Duterte had told them he wanted martial law for another 60 days. Slideshow (2 Images)In the case of continuing martial law beyond the initial 60-day limit, the constitution does not restrict how long it can be extended, although Congress can challenge it.  Senator Antonio Trillanes, Duterte's top critic, said such a long extension was a  whimsical misuse of power .  I have already forewarned the public of Duterte's authoritarian tendencies and this is another proof of it,  he said in a statement. Martial law is a sensitive issue in the Philippines, bringing back memories of the 1970s rule of late dictator Ferdinand Marcos, who was accused of exaggerating security threats to justify harsh measures that allowed his regime to suppress dissent brutally. The extension would be the first time since the Marcos era that martial law was renewed. Outrage about martial law has largely been restricted to Duterte's main critics, with the majority of Filipinos behind his security measures, according to opinion polls. Lower house speaker, Pantaleon Alvarez, an ally of Duterte, said it was likely Congress would endorse the president's request to extend martial law until the end of the year. He also said Congress should look into possible intelligence failures that led to the siege, in particular, how the militants managed to stockpile so many weapons.

The Braves saw their three-game winning streak snapped as they were held to just six hits in the opener, after pounding out 31 n a three-game weekend sweep of Arizona. Atlanta's Brandon Phillips finished 2-for-4 Monday and is 9-for-16 with five RBIs since the All-Star break. One Braves hitter struggling at the moment is Freddie Freeman, who is 1-for-12 in the past three games, but Atlanta scored twice in the ninth and loaded the bases before Wade Davis escaped with the save.

The 38-year-old went 11-8 with a 3.35 ERA last season but struggled through the first half, allowing four earned runs or more eight times in 17 starts. Lackey, who gave up three runs on six hits in six innings July 5 against Tampa Bay, is 1-1 with a 2.59 ERA in four career starts against the Braves. Newcomb impressed in his first four major-league starts, but is 0-2 with a 13.50 ERA and 11 runs allowed in 7 1/3 innings in two July starts. The 24-year-old gave up four runs on four hits in four innings July 9 at Washington, five days after surrendering seven runs on 10 hits in 3 1/3 innings of a loss to Houston. Newcomb, who struggled with his control at times in the minors, has walked six batters in July after issuing just eight walks in 24 1/3 innings in his first four outings. Walk-Offs 1. Atlanta INF/OF Sean Rodriguez, sidelined all season after sustaining injuries in an offseason automobile accident, went 0-for-3 with a walk in his season debut Monday. 2.

Minnesota looks to grab hold of the second wild card in the American League when it hosts the New York Yankees on Tuesday for the middle contest of their three-game series. The Twins, who were the only team to reach triple digits in losses (103) last year, posted a 4-2 triumph in Monday's opener to climb within one-half game of New York for the playoff spot. Eduardo Escobar snapped an eighth-inning tie with a pinch-hit RBI single as Minnesota remained 1 1/2 games behind Cleveland for first place in the AL Central. The Yankees fell to 2-3 on their 11-game road trip but remained 3 1/2 in back of Boston for the top spot in the AL East.

The 25-year-old Mexican allowed four runs (two earned) on five hits and three walks over 4 2/3 innings in that outing - a road loss against the Chicago White Sox - but has worked 6 2/3 scoreless frames in a pair of relief appearances since. Cessa came out of the bullpen to face Minnesota once last year, yielding a solo homer and a walk in 1 2/3 innings. Colon is receiving another chance to prove he still can pitch in the major leagues after a horrendous 13-start tenure with Atlanta that resulted in his release on July 4.

The Nationals (56-36) are coming off a four-game sweep in Cincinnati as the National League's most potent offense outscored the Reds 35-12 and hit 13 home runs along the way, including three by Bryce Harper. The Angels (46-49), who lost two of three to Tampa Bay over the weekend, are among the top seven teams in contention for the two wild card spots in the American League.

Oil Minister Carlos Perez said that Ecuador's compliance with the agreed cuts was only around 60 percent, putting current output at 545,000 bpd.  We need funds for the fiscal treasury and for that reason we've taken the decision to gradually increase production, although not to the country's full potential, because of OPEC's output restrictions and the ceiling that we have as a result,  Perez said in a televised interview. The country's fiscal deficit will hit 7.5 percent of GDP this year, the government says, as it continues to suffer from the global fall in oil prices. Under an agreement between members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other oil producers led by Russia, the South American country agreed to contribute a 26,000 barrels per day reduction to its oil production.  Unfortunately, we are currently at a reduction of around 16,000 bpd. We are not meeting the quota imposed on us because of the obvious needs the country has,  Perez said. A Reuters monthly survey of OPEC output shows Ecuador's compliance with the terms of the deal has never been above 69 percent since the agreement came into effect on Jan. 1.  There is an unwritten agreement with OPEC to have some kind of flexibility regarding Ecuador's needs,  he added.  What Ecuador does or does not do has no great impact on OPEC's total output.

That is likely welcome news for Chinese officials that have been trying to tamp down an overheated property market and speculation in financial markets in favor of investment in the real economy and upgrades of China's massive industrial sector.  But a continued slowdown in consumption growth this year could present an ongoing challenge to China's efforts to shift to a consumer-led economy. The industrial sector, which accounts for about a third of the economy, grew 6.6 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier, data from the statistics bureau showed on Tuesday. That was up slightly from 6.5 percent in the first quarter and the fastest pace since the fourth quarter of 2014. The real estate sector, meanwhile, only expanded 6.2 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier, the slowest since the end of 2015, and down significantly from 7.8 percent growth in the first quarter, as government curbs dragged on the sector. Finance sector growth also decelerated to its slowest pace since the third quarter of 2004, after clocking 3.2 percent growth in the second quarter from 4.4 percent in the first quarter.  On Monday, China reported second quarter growth CNGDP=ECI of 6.9 percent, unchanged from the first quarter and setting the country on course to comfortably meet its 2017 growth target. Despite private surveys showing small firms struggling amid weaker demand and greater competition, the statistics bureau said the performance of small and micro businesses was relatively stable in the first half of 2017. A survey showed that business confidence among small and micro companies rebounded to a nearly two-year high in the second quarter on more orders and a better financing environment, NBS official Zhao Yuncheng wrote in a commentary. That is in contrast to a long-running survey by Standard Chartered showing business activity for smaller Chinese firms hit the lowest in 16 months in June. Consumer Spending Growth Slows While policymakers continue to trumpet China's shift to a consumer-oriented economy - it contributed the lion's share of growth in the first half - data from NBS showed real growth in per capita consumer spending of 6.1 percent in the first half was the slowest since the data was first published in 2014. Second quarter growth of the consumer-driven retail and catering/accomodation sectors was the slowest since the third quarter of last year at 7.1 percent and 7.0 percent, respectively, the data showed.

The change, discussed at a meeting of CalPERS board in Monterey, would be closely watched by other U.S. public pensions as they look to improve returns on their investments, in part by cutting fees. The $323 billion pension fund, the largest in the country and a trend setter, has been under increasing pressure to achieve returns closer to the fund's assumed rate of return of 7 percent by 2020. In the fiscal year ended June 30, private equity investment returned 13.9 percent, the second best performer behind public equities, or stock portfolio. The asset class helped to boost the fund's total year-end returns to 11.2 percent, exceeding expectations for the first time since 2014. Private equity has been CalPERS' best performing asset class in the past two decades and accounts for about $26 billion of its portfolio. But CalPERS mainly invests in private equity funds and has been criticized for accepting the high fees and limited disclosures typically associated with the asset class. The shift in strategy, if adopted, is likely to require a considerable investment in staff and expertise in the years ahead to handle the strategic shift. CalPERS Chief Investment Officer Ted Eliopoulos told Reuters he would recommend CalPERS  explore setting up a separate vehicle  for direct investments and expand the current co-investment program. Eliopoulos suggested CalPERS focus on opportunities that do not compete with its current private equity investments, such as owning companies for longer than 10 years, and investing in technology and life science companies.  CalPERS has a unique opportunity to be a leader in the co-investment space,  Sandra Horbach, U.S. buyouts co-head at The Carlyle Group, told the board on Monday. CalPERS' massive size would make it a formidable player and allow the fund to dictate some investment terms, Horbach said. Most U.S.-based funds shy away from such investments, while Canadian pension funds are considered leaders in the strategy. By its own account, CalPERS has developed somewhat of a negative image among private equity firms as being difficult to work with and slow to make decisions, John Cole, CalPERS investment director, told the board at Monday's meeting. A number of funds  have told us that we have become too unpredictable to do business with, and many larger general partners are cutting back the amounts that they are willing to allocate to us in their new funds , Cole said.

But she has adjusted her approach since arriving last year at the 70-bed North Baldwin Infirmary in rural, southern Alabama. Low patient admissions and high costs mean the hospital does not have doctors on site around-the-clock to administer anesthesia in the case of an unexpected emergency Cesarean. As a result, Dr. Arthur performs the surgery if there are any signs of complication, rather than waiting and running the risk that comes with the 20 to 30 minutes it takes for an anesthesiologist to arrive in the middle of the night.  It's better for me to do a C-section when I suspect that something may happen,  she said of her new strategy. “Getting the baby out healthy and happy outweighs some of the risk.” Physicians in rural communities across America are facing the same tough choices as Dr. Arthur. Hospitals are scaling back services, shutting their maternity wards or closing altogether, according to data from hospitals, state health departments, the federal government and rural health organizations. Nationally, 119 rural hospitals that have shut since 2005, with 80 of those closures having occurred since 2010, according to the most recent data from the North Carolina Rural Health Research Program. To save on insurance and staffing costs, maternity departments are often among the first to get shuttered inside financially stressed rural hospitals, according medical professionals and healthcare experts. “It’s been a slow and steady decline,” said Michael Topchik, the National Leader for the Chartis Center for Rural Health, about maternity ward closings. “It’s very expensive care to offer, especially when it’s lower volume.” More than 200 maternity wards closed between 2004 and 2014 because of higher costs, fewer births and staffing shortages, leaving 54 percent of rural counties across the United States without hospital-based obstetrics, data from the University of Minnesota’s Rural Health Research Center show. The trend has escalated recently even though the national healthcare law, known as Obamacare, was designed in part to help rural hospitals thrive. But unpaid patient debt has risen among rural hospitals by 50 percent since the Affordable Care Act was passed, according to the National Rural Health Association, especially in states that decided not to expand Medicaid – the state and federal insurance program for the poor. The outlook for these hospitals was not poised to improve had Congress approved legislation to replace Obamacare. Senate Republicans’ proposed cuts to Medicaid would have pushed about 150 more rural hospitals into the red, according to the Chartis Center for Rural Health, mainly in states that voted Republican in the last election. But late on Monday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the Republican effort to repeal and immediately replace Obamacare will not be successful, after two of McConnell's Senate conservatives announced that they would not support the bill. Pain Felt Beyond the Beltway The consequences go beyond politics. When local doctors and midwives leave town, rural women lose access to essential services. Many skip or delay prenatal care that could prevent complications, premature birth or even death. The U.S. infant mortality rate is among the highest in developing countries at 5.8 deaths per 1,000 births. Pregnant woman in rural areas are more likely to have their deliveries induced or by Cesarean section that, while potentially life-saving, are more expensive and risky than a normal vaginal birth, according to patients, medical professionals and researchers. Almost a year after her second son’s birth, Courtney Cross is still repaying money she borrowed because of the smaller paychecks and larger gas bills she had from driving 60 minutes each way to a specialist in Mobile, Alabama. “There were some days I had to reschedule because of the money factor,” said Cross, a medical technician and mother of two, who some months made the trip multiple times. “I had to make money.” Cross is not alone. The most common reasons for the hospital closures are people and money. More and more people are moving to urban areas in pursuit of work and a better paycheck. And in most states, lower revenue from insurance and U.S. government payments are pushing these hospitals into financial stress, particularly in states that did not build out their Medicaid programs as Obamacare allowed. “The majority of births in rural America are paid for by Medicaid, and Medicaid is not the most generous payer,” said Diane Calmus, government affairs and policy manager for the National Rural Health Association. “For most hospitals it is a money losing proposition.” This is the main reason why Connie Trujillo shuttered her midwife practice this spring in Las Vegas, New Mexico. The local hospital had closed its maternity ward, and the closest hospital to deliver babies was at least 60 miles away. She sees more elective inductions because the patients live far away and can't afford to go back and forth. “Some of them just don’t have the resources,” she said. A year after shuttering, the hospital is trying to hire additional staff to reopen the ward. More Scheduled Deliveries The number of induced U.S. deliveries nationally has doubled since 1990 to about 23.3 percent, but rates are significantly higher in rural areas, where it is routinely offered to women traveling long distances, especially if the weather is bad. Induced labor and surgery come at a high cost. Commercial insurance and Medicaid paid about 50 percent more for Cesarean than vaginal births, according to a 2013 Truven Health Analytics report. The report said Medicaid payments for maternal and newborn care for a vaginal birth was $9,131 versus $13,590 for a C-section. In largely rural West Virginia - where the Summersville Regional Medical Center became the latest hospital to stop delivering newborns earlier this year - elected inductions for first time mothers rose to 28.7 percent in 2015 from 24.1 percent in 2011, according to data provided to Reuters by the West Virginia Perinatal Partnership, a statewide effort to improve care.  Inductions allow the physicians to manage their case loads and timing of deliveries,” said Amy Tolliver, director of the Perinatal Partnership. “We know that inductions are happening in small hospitals that have difficulty with staffing.  To address staffing issues at Dr Arthur’s hospital in Alabama, the facility paid temporary doctors for a year to keep the department open when one of its two maternity doctors stopped doing deliveries. “It’s important to have access (to obstetrics),” said hospital president Benjamin Hansert, who also organized a group of doctors from Mobile about 40 minutes away to cover some of the shifts so that staff doctors would not always be on call. “Where the mother goes for care, the rest of the family will follow.” For the full graphic on hospital closures, click tmsnrt.rs/2us7qDM Editing by Caroline Humer and Edward Tobin","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-healthcare-rural-idUSL1N1K903I"},

That is likely welcome news for Chinese officials that have been trying to tamp down an overheated property market and speculation in financial markets in favor of investment in the real economy and upgrades of China's massive industrial sector.  But a continued slowdown in consumption growth this year could present an ongoing challenge to China's efforts to shift to a consumer-led economy. The industrial sector, which accounts for about a third of the economy, grew 6.6 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier, data from the statistics bureau showed on Tuesday. That was up slightly from 6.5 percent in the first quarter and the fastest pace since the fourth quarter of 2014. The real estate sector, meanwhile, only expanded 6.2 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier, the slowest since the end of 2015, and down significantly from 7.8 percent growth in the first quarter, as government curbs dragged on the sector. Finance sector growth also decelerated to its slowest pace since the third quarter of 2004, after clocking 3.2 percent growth in the second quarter from 4.4 percent in the first quarter.  On Monday, China reported second quarter growth CNGDP=ECI of 6.9 percent, unchanged from the first quarter and setting the country on course to comfortably meet its 2017 growth target. Despite private surveys showing small firms struggling amid weaker demand and greater competition, the statistics bureau said the performance of small and micro businesses was relatively stable in the first half of 2017. A survey showed that business confidence among small and micro companies rebounded to a nearly two-year high in the second quarter on more orders and a better financing environment, NBS official Zhao Yuncheng wrote in a commentary. That is in contrast to a long-running survey by Standard Chartered showing business activity for smaller Chinese firms hit the lowest in 16 months in June. Consumer Spending Growth Slows While policymakers continue to trumpet China's shift to a consumer-oriented economy - it contributed the lion's share of growth in the first half - data from NBS showed real growth in per capita consumer spending of 6.1 percent in the first half was the slowest since the data was first published in 2014. Second quarter growth of the consumer-driven retail and catering/accomodation sectors was the slowest since the third quarter of last year at 7.1 percent and 7.0 percent, respectively, the data showed.

Droughts are shriveling high-quality wheat crops in key breadbaskets, sending prices to multi-year highs as bread makers scramble for supplies.  Low prices against a backdrop of plentiful supply had discouraged U.S. farmers from planting wheat, and dry weather is now exacerbating the shortage from North America to Australia. Canada's Alberta province, another top wheat producer, is also suffering from unusually dry weather.       The million-dollar question that the trade is still trying to figure out is, of all the global supplies out there, how much is going to be high-protein wheat?  said Terry Reilly, senior commodity analyst with Futures International in Chicago. Wanted: High-Protein Wheat The world is awash with lower grades, with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) projecting world wheat stocks at the end of the 2017/18 marketing year at a record high of 260.6 million tonnes.  But flour millers and bakers need milling wheat, often with a protein level of 12 percent or higher, to make consistent bread. U.S. spring wheat, typically with a protein content of 14 percent or higher, is also used for blending with lower grades of wheat. Spring wheat usually commands a premium over the lower-quality grades. The United States is one of the world's biggest wheat exporters. Latest estimates from the USDA put U.S. production of spring wheat other than durum, which is used for pasta, at 423 million bushels, the smallest since 2002. Wheat futures on the Chicago Board of Trade hit two-year highs this month above $5.50 a bushel, while values on the Minneapolis Grain Exchange - a niche market for high-protein spring wheat - spiked above $8 a bushel for the first time in four years. Market direction will depend now in part on how spring wheat crops in the United States and Canada, which typically have high protein levels, finish the growing season, and whether Australia's drought persists. Next week, the market will find out how bad the damage is to wheat fields in North Dakota, by far the biggest U.S. spring wheat producer, when industry experts and farmers conduct an annual crop tour. Drought and searing heat have scorched crops in the western portion of the state, but crops along the eastern border and in neighboring Minnesota so far have escaped major damage. The impact of weather problems is magnified because wheat plantings in the United States for 2017 were the smallest in records dating to 1919, reflecting low prices that prompted farmers to plant other crops including soybeans and corn. European Option?  The European Union and Russia, which vie with the United States to be the world's top exporter, have the potential to supply some customers that normally rely on North American high-protein grain. European traders are hopeful German high-protein wheat will take over export sales to traditional customers of U.S. spring wheat, especially Nigeria and other African countries. There are some concerns, however, that late-season rains in Germany may reduce protein levels.  The late rain could cause higher yields in tonnage terms but these larger-yield crops often have lower protein,” one trader said.  It is too early to say if the rain will reduce protein or if Germany’s harvest will contain sufficient volumes of high-protein wheat.  Russia's wheat crop has been delayed this year by rainy and cold weather but the country's harvest is still expected to be large, only slightly lower than a record crop a year ago.  The quality in general will be higher than a year ago,  Arkady Zlochevsky, the head of Russia's Grain Union, a non-government farmers' lobby, told reporters in Moscow on Tuesday. Traders and analysts are, however, cutting expectations for Australia's wheat production due to a lack of soil moisture.   Some areas in Western Australia (one of the larger wheat and rapeseed producing states) are experiencing all-time record low record soil moisture levels. With conditions as they are ... drought stress will almost certainly be an issue for crops moving forward,  said Thomson Reuters weather analyst Ed Whalen.  The market is beginning to factor in a crop of between 19 million to 21 million tonnes,  said Matthew Pattison, trading manager at Nidera, the grains trader acquired this year by China's COFCO Group.  Australia's chief commodity forecaster in June pegged wheat output at 24.1 million tonnes.  Should Australian exporters have less wheat to ship, Indonesian and South Korean millers will be forced to turn to supplies from the Black Sea, where production has been aggressively expanded in the last decade. Australia has steadily lost market share in recent years, especially to Russia, and analysts believe there could be a permanent shift away from the world's No. 4 exporter. A shortfall in the U.S. spring wheat crop could bolster imports of Canadian spring wheat, said Jay O'Neil, an agricultural economist with Kansas State University.  Not everyone faces shortages of high-quality wheat, however. China has increased output of better-quality wheat significantly this year, and that could cut its demand for imports from major suppliers such as the United States and Australia.

Three sources with knowledge of the discussions said the two state-owned firms have been in negotiations for months, though any agreement could still be some time away. The talks between two of China's largest metals producers are part of Beijing's broad efforts to shake up its indebted and inefficient state sector, streamline the number of companies and create globally competitive firms in sectors including power generation, shipping and metals. Minmetals, which controls Hong Kong-listed unit MMG, said it was not aware of any discussions over a tie-up and said it would publish any statement on its website. China National Gold - one of the top gold miners in a country that has become the world's largest producer - declined to comment. The State Assets and Supervision Administration Commission (SASAC), which oversees the sector and favors an overall shake-up, did not respond to a request for comment. A combination of Minmetals, one of China's biggest state-owned enterprises, and much smaller, precious metals-focused CNG would not be without challenges, not least in terms of scale. It was not immediately clear how a combined group would be managed. China Minmetals, already a major mining company, became the world's largest metallurgical construction and operation services company after merging with state-owned China Metallurgical Group in 2015. [reut.rs/2u0rZ8V] With total assets of around $236 billion globally, Minmetals became one of the world's largest copper miners when it bought Australia's Oz Minerals in 2009 and Glencore's Las Bambas copper mine in Peru for $7 billion in 2014 - one of China's largest overseas acquisitions at the time.  Debt racked up as a result of the Peru deal, combined with plunging global commodities prices then dragged Minmetals to a loss. It reported an 18.2 billion yuan ($2.7 billion) loss in 2015. That turned around to a 4.1 billion yuan profit in 2016. It signed an exploration deal with Rio Tinto last month, and employs over 240,000 people. China National Gold is a much smaller company, with combined total assets of around $9 billion from its two listed entities. It is China's only gold industry firm directly managed by the central government, with operations also in silver, copper and molybdenum.  China Minmetals owns eight listed companies in China and Hong Kong, including Metallurgical Corporation of China which has a market capitalization of around $15 billion, and MMG with a $3 billion market value. The two listed units under China National Gold have a combined market value of around $5.8 billion. Management Changes? The management make-up of a merged entity is not clear. One of the sources said China Minmetals' Chairman He Wenbo, 62, was expected to be near retirement. And Guo Wenqing, president, is expected to move to SASAC after the 19th communist party congress that is to be held later this year, the source added. China National Gold's board members, by contrast, are newly confirmed, having been appointed by SASAC just months ago.  Minmetals did not reply immediately to a Reuters request for comment on its personnel changes. If carried out, this would be the second marriage of metals companies overseen by Beijing as part of the government's goal to fight overcapacity in its bloated heavy industries. Last year, Baosteel's takeover of its smaller, debt-laden rival Wuhan created China's largest steelmaker.  Coal giant Shenhua Group Corp Ltd [SHGRP.UL] and top-five state power producer China Guodian Corp [CNGUO.UL] are in talks to merge some assets, Reuters reported in June. Reuters reported in May that chemical giant Sinochem was in talks with ChemChina, which completed its $43 billion acquisition of Swiss seeds company Syngenta AG.

Iraqi forces last week declared victory over Islamic State in Mosul, though clashes continue in parts of the Old City.   Die Welt newspaper said the five women had been detained during the military operations in the city and it identified the German teenager only as Linda W. Lorenz Haase, chief prosecutor for the state of Saxony, said officials were investigating whether the 16-year-old was the same teenager who went missing last summer from the small town of Pulsnitz, near the eastern German city of Dresden. Authorities had launched an investigation of the girl for alleged contacts with the jihadist group about preparation for a possible act of terrorism.  A German foreign ministry source said the ministry was seeking information on the nationality of the five women detained in Mosul, adding that anybody with a German passport would be offered consular assistance. An Iraqi official said he believed the teenager arrested was not German but of Slavic origin, possibly Russian. He said she had been taken to a hospital for burns and was in the custody of Iraqi security services, adding that they would likely hand her over to her country's diplomatic mission and not kept in Iraq.  Haase told Reuters the German teenager had traveled to Turkey about a year ago with the apparent goal of reaching Iraq or Syria. Security officials later lost her trail but new evidence has now emerged in the case, Haase said. Die Welt said the girl had converted to Islam shortly before she disappeared and had been in contact with Islamic State via internet chats. The BfV domestic intelligence agency, which had no immediate comment on Die Welt report, estimates that 930 people have left Germany in recent years to join Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. Around 20 percent are women. Minors account for about 5 percent of the total number, of which half are female, a spokeswoman told Reuters.  A French diplomat said the French wife of a suspected Islamic State fighter and her four children had been detained in the ruins of Mosul 10 days ago and that France was ready to offer consular services. The husband is still missing.

After years of underinvestment, the former monopoly was privatised in 2013 and has since reduced layers of management, upgraded technology and cut its property bill. However, the company was left struggling last year as its domestic parcels business faced stiff competition and as uncertainty following Britain's vote to leave the European Union worsened the rate of decline in its letters business. Against this backdrop, Royal Mail said on Tuesday that increased revenue from political mail related to Britain's June 8 general election meant that its postal business helped to limit the damage in the first quarter to June 25. Revenue from the business fell 4 percent in the three months, versus a 3 percent decline a year ago but better than a 5 percent drop over last year as a whole.  Royal Mail has emerged as the one clear winner of last month's general election, with political mailings helping to slow the inexorable decline in UK letter volumes,  Hargreaves Lansdown equity analyst Nicholas Hyett said.  However, increasingly it's the international business which will be driving growth long term. The division put in another respectable performance this quarter, with recent acquisitions increasing its importance to the overall business. The pan-European delivery business on Tuesday showed continued growth, with first-quarter revenue rising 6 percent despite some impact from the timing of Easter and other public holidays across Europe. Revenue was up 13 percent a year ago. Royal Mail has been bulking up its GLS delivery business, as it has forecast continued challenging conditions in Britain and now faces an uphill battle negotiating pension arrangements with some of the country's largest unions. To expand the unit, Royal Mail bought Spain-focused ASM and U.S.-based GSO last year and U.S. overnight delivery company Postal Express in April.  GLS continues to be a driving force for the group. Its ongoing, focussed international expansion is increasing our geographic diversification, scale and reach,  Chief Executive Moya Greene said in a statement. The company's shares were up 3 percent at 411.1 pence at 1030 GMT, making it the second-top gainer on London's FTSE 100 index. The stock has lost over a fifth in value over the past year.

Its human right's body and voiced concern at the fate of those still in their custody. The LNA is pushing to expand its presence in central and southern Libya, where it has been vying for control with forces linked to the U.N.-backed government in Tripoli and other opponents. LNA leader Khalifa Haftar has gained ground with Egyptian and Emirati support, and Western states say Haftar must be part of any solution to Libya’s conflict  We are deeply concerned that, after recent fighting in Benghazi, people taken prisoner by members of the Libyan National Army, which effectively controls eastern Libya, may be at imminent risk of torture and even summary execution,  U.N. human rights spokeswoman Liz Throssell told a news briefing. Reports have suggested the involvement of Special Forces, a unit aligned with the LNA,  in torturing detainees and summarily executing at least 10 captured men , she said. The Libyan National Army announced last March that it would conduct investigations into alleged war crimes but has not shared any information, Throssell said.   We urge the LNA to ensure there is a full, impartial investigation into these allegations,  she said. Throssell also called on the group to suspend Mahmoud al-Werfalli from his duties as a Special Forces field commander pending the conclusion of such an investigation. A video circulating on social media in March allegedly showed al-Werfalli shooting dead three men who were kneeling and facing a wall with their hands tied behind their backs, Throssell said. In June, two further videos appeared to show summary executions carried out by LNA fighters on his orders.  One of these videos, which emerged on 9 June, shows four men kneeling with their hands tied behind their backs who are shot dead as al-Werfalli watches,  she said.  The latest video, which was posted on social media this month, seems to shows LNA fighters kicking and taunting prisoners, while al-Werfalli is apparently heard accusing two men who have their hands tied behind their backs of belonging to terrorist groups,  she said. The LNA has declined comment on the images.

China is the world's top fertiliser consumer, and the move comes as Beijing tries to cap the growth in traditional fertilisers and pesticides that have caused severe pollution. International Finance Corporation (IFC), the private sector investment arm of the World Bank, says products such as those offered by Kingenta can reduce environmental harm through more efficient plant take-up and less contamination of water. Kingenta is aiming to reach 50 million farmers with the service centres that will be run by a new venture called Kingfarm Co-operative, according to a statement. The company said the Kingfarm centres will be the first in China to offer farmers full agricultural services in one outlet.  It's mostly a question of scale. If you distribute product in larger volumes, you get a better price and shorten the distribution time,  said Sergio Pimenta, head of manufacturing, agribusiness and services at IFC, which is investing $200 million in the project. Kingenta executives could not be reached for further comment on their plans. The company produces compound fertilisers, made from combining fertilizer materials like ammonia, urea and potassium salts, as well as water-soluble and slow-release fertilisers. Its centres will also distribute seeds and pesticides from third-party suppliers - including global chemicals firm BASF and France's seeds-to-crop protection firm InVivo - and offer services for processing and distribution of products, Kingenta's statement said. China consumes around a third of global fertilisers, with rapid growth in use in recent years driven largely by higher fruit and vegetable production. The agriculture ministry said in 2015 that it was targeting  zero growth  in consumption of nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers by 2020. Compound fertilizers can increase crop yields by up to 40 percent with the same amount of application as conventional fertilizer, said the IFC. However, such product represents only about 30 percent of the annual fertilizer consumption in China, compared with 50 to 60 percent in other large food producers, such as Brazil and Thailand, it said. Kingfarm will upgrade 10 conventional fertiliser plants located near its planned service centres to produce more specialty fertilisers, the IFC also said. The first such plant scheduled for an upgrade is in Hubei province, China's top producer of rice.

Iron ore shipments were impacted by an acceleration in our rail maintenance program following poor weather in the first quarter,  Chief Executive Jean-Sebastien Jacques said. Second-quarter iron ore shipments from Australia fell 6 percent from a year ago to 77.7 million tonnes, slightly below analysts' forecasts as Rio Tinto transitions to a driverless train network. First-half shipments totaled 154.3 million tonnes, indicating the company expects to pick up shipments in the remaining two quarters. Second-quarter production from its Australian mines fell 1 percent to 79.8 million tonnes, Rio Tinto said. In other minerals, Rio Tinto cut its full-year production target for hard coking coal to 7.2–7.8 million tonnes following a 14 percent fall in second-quarter production after a cyclone that swept across its collieries earlier this year.

Its human right's body and voiced concern at the fate of those still in their custody. The LNA is pushing to expand its presence in central and southern Libya, where it has been vying for control with forces linked to the U.N.-backed government in Tripoli and other opponents. LNA leader Khalifa Haftar has gained ground with Egyptian and Emirati support, and Western states say Haftar must be part of any solution to Libya’s conflict  We are deeply concerned that, after recent fighting in Benghazi, people taken prisoner by members of the Libyan National Army, which effectively controls eastern Libya, may be at imminent risk of torture and even summary execution,  U.N. human rights spokeswoman Liz Throssell told a news briefing. Reports have suggested the involvement of Special Forces, a unit aligned with the LNA,  in torturing detainees and summarily executing at least 10 captured men , she said. The Libyan National Army announced last March that it would conduct investigations into alleged war crimes but has not shared any information, Throssell said.   We urge the LNA to ensure there is a full, impartial investigation into these allegations,  she said. Throssell also called on the group to suspend Mahmoud al-Werfalli from his duties as a Special Forces field commander pending the conclusion of such an investigation. A video circulating on social media in March allegedly showed al-Werfalli shooting dead three men who were kneeling and facing a wall with their hands tied behind their backs, Throssell said. In June, two further videos appeared to show summary executions carried out by LNA fighters on his orders.  One of these videos, which emerged on 9 June, shows four men kneeling with their hands tied behind their backs who are shot dead as al-Werfalli watches,  she said.  The latest video, which was posted on social media this month, seems to shows LNA fighters kicking and taunting prisoners, while al-Werfalli is apparently heard accusing two men who have their hands tied behind their backs of belonging to terrorist groups,  she said. The LNA has declined comment on the images.

Britons voted just over a year ago to leave the EU and envoys on Monday began a first round of negotiations on the terms of the split before Britain departs - with or without a deal - at the end of March 2019. There is still little lucidity on what tone the talks will take but several Reuters polls over the past few months have concluded that fractious negotiations would be the worst outcome for both Britain's economy and sterling.  We expect the exit negotiations to be bumpy,  economists at Morgan Stanley wrote in a note to clients.  We see MPC action as dependent on economic performance (and) we assume that the economy will slow and keep them on hold despite inflation overshooting the target.   The medians in the poll of economists said the Monetary Policy Committee would hold Bank Rate at its record low of 0.25 percent until 2019. Those forecasters gave, on average, a near one-in-three chance of rates rising before this year is out.  Financial markets have fully priced in a 25 basis point hike by May 2018 but the poll said rates will not rise until 2019, ending that year at 0.75 percent. Only two of the 80 economists polled in the past few days expect the MPC to tighten policy when it meets on Aug. 3, but they are joined by four others who expect an increase by end-December. The chances of a hike in August are only one-in-five, according the poll.   Weak GDP and wage growth will keep higher interest rates at bay,  said Samuel Tombs at Pantheon Macroeconomics.  Households' real incomes are set to flatline this year.  Consumer spending played a large part in Britain's economic growth last year but workers' pay fell further behind inflation in the three months to May, even as the unemployment rate hit a new 42-year low. The MPC is watching wage growth closely as it gauges whether the increase in inflation from the fall in the pound becomes more longer-lasting pressure. The BoE expects wages to rise 2 percent this year before picking up in 2018 and 2019. But that will lag price rises as inflation will average 2.7 percent this year, 2.6 percent next and 2.2 percent in 2019, the Reuters poll found. The MPC targets it at 2 percent. Inflation hit an almost four-year high of 2.9 percent in May, a bigger increase than economists had expected. Figures due later on Tuesday will probably show prices rose at the same annual rate in June.  Although the predicted recession after Britain voted to leave the bloc never happened, growth slowed sharply at the start of 2017 as consumers felt the hit from rising inflation. GDP growth is forecast between 0.3 and 0.4 percent through to the end of 2018, barely keeping pace with the euro zone. On an annual basis, the forecasts are for 1.6 percent this year and just 1.3 percent in 2018.

R2G, which owns 8 percent of Pegas, said on Monday its investment vehicle R2G Rohan Czech would bid 1,010 crowns per share, valuing the Prague-listed firm at 9.3 billion crowns ($411 million). Pegas shares jumped more than 8 percent to a record high of 1,020 crowns and were trading at 1,019 crowns at 0942 GMT on Monday, above the offer price. R2G, a Czech family fund, is the second biggest shareholder after Wood Textiles Holding, part of the Wood & Co. investment group that owns about a quarter of Pegas shares. Wood told Reuters it was not considering selling its stake.  At the moment we regard the long-term growth potential of Pegas. So we are not changing our strategy, which is long-term,  Wood Textiles director Petr Vosvrda said by phone.  We are a shareholder since 2009 and are not considering a sale.  Analysts had expected the offer might not be enough and saw a chance it might be raised. J&T; analyst Bohumil Trampota said the two shareholders had not worked closely so far, noting Wood had rejected most of R2G's counterproposals at Pegas' June shareholder meeting.  We think that taking over Pegas at 1,010 crowns a share is not very likely,  he said.  Minority shareholders have at least a month to make a decision. We recommend wait-and-see tactics as the offer price could be raised.  A Pegas spokesman had no immediate comment on the offer. Pegas runs eight production lines making non-woven fabrics for hygiene products in the Czech Republic. It also has a factory in Egypt and plans to invest in a South African plant. It has customers in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. R2G, with funds of more than 1 billion euros was started in 2016 by businessman Oldrich Slemr after he and his business partner sold CGS Holding tyre group to Sweden's Trelleborg. The group manages the family money of Eduard Kucera and Pavel Baudis, founders of Czech security software group Avast. It said on Monday it was a long-term investor and believed Pegas should accumulate cash to enable it to undertake acquisitions in its sector.

Veteran leader Mahathir and his former protege Najib have been embroiled in a feud for nearly two years, with Mahathir campaigning to oust Najib over alleged graft linked to scandal-ridden state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB). Najib denies wrongdoing. Mahathir said Najib should attend a town hall session he dubbed  Nothing to Hide .  This is a good platform to state the truth, and Najib should attend to speak the truth or address the allegations,  Mahathir told a news conference.  Also, I want to ask Najib on his many failures and several issues that have drawn public attention,  he said. Najib's office had no immediate comment on Mahathir's call. The government recently formed a royal commission to investigate a two-decade-old multi-billion-dollar foreign-exchange scandal that occurred during Mahathir's tenure as prime minister. FILE PHOTO: Former Malaysian prime minister Mahathir Mohammad arrives to speak at a rally to pro-democracy group Bersih during a 1MDB protest, calling for Prime Minister Najib Abdul Razak to resign, in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia November 19, 2016.Edgar Su/File PhotoThe prime minister’s office said on Tuesday the commission would complete its investigation and present a report within three months. Mahathir, who dealt ruthlessly with opponents during his 1981 to 2003 rule, has emerged at the center of opposition to Najib, even at the age of 92. Mahathir has joined a fractured opposition alliance and even offered to head the government again if it wins an election, due by next year. He would be the world's oldest prime minister if that happened. FILE PHOTO: Former Malaysian prime minister Mahathir Mohamad speaks during an interview with Reuters in Putrajaya, Malaysia, March 30, 2017.Lai Seng Sin/File Photo The fact is I'm the chairman of this grouping of opposition parties ... So I think I am the equivalent of Najib, albeit unofficially,  he said. 1MDB is the subject of money laundering investigations in at least six countries. The U.S. Justice Department alleged in civil lawsuits that about $4.5 billion of funds were misappropriated from the fund. Najib denied taking money from 1MDB after it was reported that investigators traced nearly $700 million to his bank accounts. Authorities cleared him of any wrongdoing saying the money was a donation from Saudi Arabia. Najib is widely expected to call the election in coming months. He will be fighting to reverse dismal showings for the ruling party in the last two elections, when it lost considerable ground although still won enough seats to rule in a coalition with its allies.  Najib's party has held power since Malaysia's independence in 1957.

We cannot comment in detail on ongoing negotiations, but we can confirm that talks have resumed,  a spokesman for Discovery said in an e-mailed statement. Germany's Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung had reported late on Monday that the renewed negotiations were focused on the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, for the moment, but said a cooperation on subsequent Games had become more likely. In 2015, Discovery won the European broadcast rights for the Olympics from 2018 to 2024 for 1.3 billion euros ($1.5 billion), beating national public broadcasters such as the BBC and France Television. It had been expected to pass on some lucrative rights. But last November ARD and ZDF said they would not show the Olympic Games for the first time, having failed to clinch a deal. Discovery said in its statement on Tuesday that its goal was to bring the Olympic Games to a larger audience than ever before.  In Germany, ARD and ZDF have a long tradition of broadcasting the Olympic Games, and both the audience and partners respect the knowledge and experience that they can bring to the table,  it said.  That is why we invited them, also as broadcaster of the 2018 Paralympics, to join us in a broadcaster meeting in Pyeongchang.  ARD/ZDF were not immediately available for comment. Germany's Manager Magazin said last year that initial talks between Discovery and ARD and ZDF had stalled over the price of a sub-licence. The magazine said at the time that ARD and ZDF wanted to pay no more than 100 million euros for the broadcast rights in Germany, while Discovery was demanding at least 150 million.

Leading homegrown online retailer Flipkart has revised its offer for SoftBank-backed Snapdeal to between $900 million and $950 million, said the sources, adding the new proposal is being evaluated by Snapdeal's board. Reuters previously reported that Snapdeal had earlier this month rejected Flipkart's initial bid of between $800 million and $850 million as its board was unsatisfied with the offer and the payment terms.   Flipkart's revised offer was made for Snapdeal's marketplace and its e-commerce solutions provider Unicommerce, but does not include its logistics arm Vulcan Express and digital payments unit FreeCharge, which may be sold separately, said the sources, who did not want to be named as the discussions are not public. One of the sources said Flipkart may withhold $150 million of the deal price for 12-24 months after the consummation of a deal. Both sources said negotiations to address the concerns of Flipkart and Snapdeal shareholders were continuing. Japan's SoftBank (9984.T) is Snapdeal's biggest shareholder.  Flipkart plans to absorb Snapdeal's employees, but it has not given any assurances around levels of employee retention, said one of the sources, noting that this was a sticking point in the talks.

Axis Bank (AXBK.NS), India's third-biggest private sector lender, top digital payments firm Paytm and a few others are in talks to buy FreeCharge which was likely to be sold for between $70 million and $80 million, one of the sources said.

The announcement overnight that two Republican senators would not support the latest version of the healthcare bill -- had led to speculation that the reform proposal was likely to be withdrawn. It fed into a belief that Trump's tax cuts and spending plans will come to nought. The dollar index against a basket of major currencies sank to its lowest since last September with euro rising above $1.15 against the greenback for the first time since May 2016. In Asian hours, the Australian dollar surged more than 1 percent after minutes from the central bank's last policy meeting showed it turning more upbeat on the economic outlook.  The reform momentum of the Trump administration has received another blow,  said strategists at Morgan Stanley led by Hans Redeker, in a note to clients. The strategists, however, added that the  Goldilocks  scenario for the United States -- loose monetary policy along with relatively healthy economic growth -- was likely to continue. Expectations for the Fed hiking interest rates this year have been pushed back to the fourth quarter, the latest Reuters poll of more than 100 economists showed. A poll conducted last month predicted the Fed would raise rates by September.  Clearly anything that comes along at the moment just corroborates the market's negative attitude on the dollar,  said Neil Mellor, senior FX strategist with Bank of New York Mellon in London.  There's just not enough inflation at the moment. And anything like this (defeat for Trump) is liable to push it lower.  Expectations for a rate hike at the Bank of England were also dented, hurting sterling, as British inflation unexpectedly slowed for the first time since last October. The drop in the pound helped the exporter-heavy FTSE 100 recoup earlier losses and trade higher on the day. Elsewhere in Europe, stocks struggled with European shares off 0.4 percent as a set of disappointing results from the likes of Ericsson and Lufthansa soured the mood. Regional stocks have rushed back into the limelight this year as foreign investors have piled in on the back of receding political risks, upbeat earnings and an economic recovery gaining traction. Bullish bets on euro zone equities were named as one of three top crowded trades in the latest Bank of America-Merrill Lynch global fund managers survey, leaving them most vulnerable to earnings disappointments or signs of central bank tightening. The MSCI All-Country World index was little changed while U.S. stock futures  were off 0.1 percent. Tempered expectations for Trump's spending plans weighed on European bond yields which edged lower, tracking U.S. equivalents, after the collapse of the second healthcare bill. U.S. 10-year bond yields fell after the news, while German 10-year yields dipped 2 basis points to 0.57 percent when European trading started on Tuesday. Yields across the globe rose sharply after Trump won the U.S. election in November on promises for tax reforms and infrastructure investment that were expected to boost growth and inflation in the world's largest economy. In commodity markets, oil prices steadied as expectations of firm demand, particularly from China, was met ample supply. Brent crude futures eased 0.1 percent to $48.35 a barrel while U.S. crude oil fell 0.2 percent to $45.93.

While setting aside money to develop Japan's growth strategy, the government will curb spending in other areas such as public works by 10 percent from this fiscal year, the sources said on condition of anonymity as the plan has not been finalised. The 4 trillion yen pool will be spent on steps that include the nurturing of talented people, making education free of charge and boosting service-sector productivity, by allocating funds saved by cutting spending elsewhere, the sources said. The plan will be part of an outline on the budget for the next fiscal year that begins in April 2018. Based on the outline, to be approved by Abe's cabinet later this week, the Ministry of Finance will gather spending requests from government ministries by the end of August. The government will not set a ceiling for total expenditure, the sources added, indicating the premier's stance of attaching greater importance to growth than fiscal consolidation. However, it will aim to cap annual gains in social security spending, which is snowballing due to Japan's fast-ageing population, at 630 billion yen through streamlining efforts, they said.

Leading homegrown online retailer Flipkart has revised its offer for SoftBank-backed Snapdeal to between $900 million and $950 million, said the sources, adding the new proposal is being evaluated by Snapdeal's board. Reuters previously reported that Snapdeal had earlier this month rejected Flipkart's initial bid of between $800 million and $850 million as its board was unsatisfied with the offer and the payment terms.   Flipkart's revised offer was made for Snapdeal's marketplace and its e-commerce solutions provider Unicommerce, but does not include its logistics arm Vulcan Express and digital payments unit FreeCharge, which may be sold separately, said the sources, who did not want to be named as the discussions are not public. One of the sources said Flipkart may withhold $150 million of the deal price for 12-24 months after the consummation of a deal. Both sources said negotiations to address the concerns of Flipkart and Snapdeal shareholders were continuing. Japan's SoftBank (9984.T) is Snapdeal's biggest shareholder.  Flipkart plans to absorb Snapdeal's employees, but it has not given any assurances around levels of employee retention, said one of the sources, noting that this was a sticking point in the talks.

Republican Senators Jerry Moran and Mike Lee announced their opposition on Monday to a U.S. legislation to dismantle and replace the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, leaving it without enough votes to pass.      Ever since Trump's Obamacare repeal failed, there has been an unwinding of a risk-off bias into a risk-on bias,  said Taye Shim, head of research at Jakarta-based Mirae Asset Sekuritas.     In Southeast Asia, Indonesian shares closed 0.3 percent lower, hurt by financials and consumer staples.     The decline was primarily driven by foreign net selling, he said.       Mixed signals from the European Central Bank with regards to their monetary policy are causing a bit of jitters, so investors might be risk-off with regards to emerging markets,  he added.      Bank Rakyat Indonesia closed down 0.7 percent, while Unilever Indonesia fell 1.4 percent to a one-week closing low.      An index of the country's 45 most liquid stocks closed 0.45 percent lower.     Thai shares declined for the third consecutive session to close at a one-week low, dragged down by financial and telecom stocks.     Siam Commercial Bank ended 2.2 percent lower, while Advanced Info Service fell 1.1 percent to a one-week closing low.     Philippine shares closed at their highest in one month, helped by gains in financial and real estate stocks.     However, the upside was limited by falls in telecom stocks. PLDT Inc dropped 3.5 percent to its lowest close in nearly two months after it shed about 2.2 percent on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday.

The 2016 deal has been under public scrutiny since it emerged that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's personal lawyer also represented the local agent of ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems, which was set to build the vessels. Thyssenkrupp said its internal probe of the matter was over for now. It said it was limited by not being allowed to conduct its own investigation in Israel and not having the powers that prosecutors or police have.  Based on the investigative measures we were able to carry out, we found no concrete indications of corruption – neither with regard to submarine projects, nor in connection with the procurement of corvettes,  it said.  However, these investigation results are explicitly provisional,  it added. The steel-to-elevators group declined to comment on Israeli media reports that the signing of the deal by Israel and Germany for the purchase of three submarines had been postponed in the wake of the ongoing corruption investigation in Israel. Officials at both the German chancellery and defense ministry declined comment on the postponement. German government officials have previously declined comment on the investigation and proceedings in Israel, describing it as an internal matter for Israel.   Last week, three suspects were remanded in custody and a fourth ordered held under house arrest after Israeli police questioned six public officials and private citizens on suspicion of corruption relating to the deal. Thyssenkrupp has suspended its relationship with its agent for the deal, Mickey Ganor, and is not currently the subject of German or Israeli investigations, it said.

Odorizzi gave up seven runs over 4 1/3 innings in a loss to the Boston Red Sox. After that defeat, he said he hoped to recharge during the All-Star break and bounce back strong in the second half, just as he did last season. So far so good. Odorizzi allowed one run on one hit over seven innings, and the Rays defeated the Oakland Athletics 3-2 at the Oakland Coliseum in the opener of a three-game series. Odorizzi (6-4) struck out five and walked two. He also gave up a home run in his 14th consecutive appearance, an ongoing franchise record.  It's just nice to get back to what I feel I'm capable of doing,  he said.  It was a frustrating first half, that's for sure, and that kind of helps ease those troubles when you come out and just do what I'm used to doing. Granted, the one hit, I'm not going to do that every time, let's be honest, but it was just good to execute pitches. Related CoveragePreview: Rays at AthleticsTampa Bay Rays - PlayerWatchOakland Athletics - PlayerWatch I was on top of balls, off-speed was better, fastball location was much better, and I wasn't constantly throwing balls in the top of the zone. Just a little adjustment I made really helped out. It was just nice to get back to being me again.  The biggest adjustment Odorizzi made was pitching out of the stretch for the entire game after walking leadoff hitter Matt Joyce in the first inning.  I felt more comfortable,  Odorizzi said.  I don't know why, but I'm going to continue doing it. Once I walked Joyce, I was in the stretch for the rest of the game because I felt better. I felt everything was just a little more crisp and I was able to get the ball down in the zone better.  Steven Souza Jr. hit his 19th home run of the season, and Evan Longoria hit his 14th, both solo shots for the Rays, who moved to within two games of the first-place Boston Red Sox in the American League East. Longoria went 2-for-4 and extended his hitting streak to 10 games.  I feel like I'm not up there fighting my swing,  Longoria said.  Until the last month, it's been a battle just to feel good going into the box.  Khris Davis hit his 26th home run of the season, a solo shot off Odorizzi in fourth inning.  We know he throws a lot of splits and he throws a lot of off-count splits,  A's manager Bob Melvin said of Odorizzi.  Threw some sliders and cutters today, and we just couldn't get a bead on him. We were having a tough time getting a good swing, let alone hitting the ball hard. Got to give him some credit tonight, he kept us off balance.  Tommy Hunter pitched a scoreless eighth inning for the Rays. In the ninth, Rays closer Alex Colome gave a leadoff double to Yonder Alonso, who scored from third with two outs on a wild pitch, making it 3-2. However, Colome retired Ryon Healy on a ground ball to record his 27th save. A's rookie right-hander Daniel Gossett allowed three runs on seven hits over a career-high seven innings in his seventh career start. He gave up two homers and has allowed 10 this season. Gossett struck out three and walked one.  He had some other baserunners that he had to pitch around tonight, but I thought getting that deep in the game, keeping his pitch count down, I thought (it was) one of his better outings we saw,  Melvin said. Souza gave Tampa Bay a 1-0 lead with a leadoff home run in the second. He lined Gossett's 1-1 pitch to left, over the out-of-town scoreboard. The Rays extended their lead to 2-0 with a run in the third. Mallex Smith walked with one out, went to second on a wild pitch and eventually scored from third when Longoria grounded into a forceout. The A's cut Tampa Bay's lead in half in the fourth when Davis launched Odorizzi's 2-2 pitch over the right-center-field fence.  It was a little bit up,  Odorizzi said of the pitch.  He's got a lot of power. I used to play with him in the minor leagues. I've seen him do that many, many times. He just had a nice bit of hitting.  Longoria answered with a two-out blast down the left field line in the fifth inning off Gossett, making it 3-1. NOTES: Rays 2B Tim Beckham was ejected by plate umpire Lance Barrett after the top of the fourth inning. Beckham had struck out looking in the fourth and appeared to dispute the call. He continued arguing as he was taking his position in the field and was ejected for the first of his career. INF Trevor Plouffe, who was traded by Oakland to Tampa Bay on June 17 after being designated for assignment, replaced Beckham. ... Tampa Bay C Wilson Ramos (sore left hamstring) missed his third consecutive game but is making progress in his recovery. He might return to the starting lineup Tuesday, Rays manager Kevin Cash said. ... Oakland INF/OF Chad Pinder (strained left hamstring) ran the bases for the second time in three days and will begin a rehab assignment Tuesday with Triple-A Nashville. ... Oakland RHP Blake Treinen, who was acquired Sunday from the Washington Nationals, made his A's debut, pitching a scoreless eighth inning.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-rays-athletics-writethru-idUSMTZED7I9T5TBL"},

Four major U.S. lenders reported an average 33 percent drop in second-quarter mortgage banking revenue on Friday, compared with the same quarter of last year. An ongoing decline in refinancing activity, higher funding costs, tougher competition and a greater portion of business coming from third parties, who generally deliver lower margins, all contributed to the slide. Even so, executives sounded optimistic about the core operation of lending to people who want to buy homes.  I wouldn't throw in the towel on the mortgage business,  Tim Sloan, chief executive officer of Wells Fargo & Co, the biggest U.S. home lender, said on Friday. Wells's quarterly mortgage banking revenue of $1.4 billion was down 19 percent from the year-ago period. A variety of factors hurt results, including the sale of a legacy portfolio of risky loans, but Wells saw improved credit quality among borrowers, and strong demand for mortgages to purchase new homes. The bank sees  huge opportunities  in growing first and second mortgages, Sloan said. JPMorgan Chase & Co, PNC Financial Services Group Inc and Citigroup Inc also reported mortgage banking revenue declines of 33 to 41 percent last week. Bank of America Corp reports results on Tuesday. Starting in 2009, banks began to benefit from a surge in mortgage refinancing, thanks to rock-bottom interest rates and federal programs to help struggling borrowers. That activity has been trailing off as rates have started to rise and many borrowers who sought lower rates have already gotten fresh loans. It will be difficult to make up for lost refinancing volumes, even though the market for home purchases has been improving, analysts said. New and existing home sales rose in May while prices reached all-time highs, according to federal housing data and the National Association of Realtors (NAR). Weekly mortgage applications shot to a seven-year high at one point during the quarter, according to data from the Mortgage Bankers Association. NAR predicts new single-family home sales will rise 8.4 percent this year. Those improvements in the market may continue for some time, analysts said, since mortgage rates remain low by historical standards and young American millennials have only recently begun to enter the housing market. But banks' mortgage businesses will only show improvements as comparisons with a previous year become easier, they said.  While we saw some pressure in the second quarter, we think that's a low point for the year,  Marty Mosby, an analyst at Vining Sparks brokerage and asset manager, told Reuters.  We should start to see some pickup in home purchase activity.

Europe's biggest economy is set for solid expansion in 2017 after growing by 0.6 percent in the first three months, driven by strong private investments, solid household spending and rebounding exports.  Our overall assessment of the economic development in Germany remains unchanged compared to the previous month,  ZEW President Achim Wambach said.  The outlook for the German economic growth in the coming six months continues to be positive,  he added. The Mannheim-based research institute said its monthly survey among German investors showed that economic sentiment deteriorated to 17.5 from 18.6 in June. This undershot a Reuters consensus forecast for a fall to 18.0. A separate gauge measuring investors' assessment of the economy's current conditions dropped to 86.4 from 88.0 last month. This compared with the Reuters consensus forecast  predicting a stable reading. VB Bank analyst Thomas Gitzel attributed the drop to possible currency effects.  German exporters don't like the prospect of a stronger euro. If the euro is rising, export goods become more expensive on world markets,  Gitzel said. The euro has risen above 1.1530 dollar EUR=, a fresh 14-month high, ahead of the next European Central Bank policy meeting on Thursday. The Economy Ministry said last week that the economy will continue to enjoy solid growth in the second quarter, driven by soaring private consumption and higher construction activity while net foreign trade is unlikely to add to the expansion. Analysts expect Germany's gross domestic product to grow by at least 0.6 in the April-June period. The Federal Statistics Office will publish preliminary second quarter GDP growth figures in mid-August. The International Monetary Fund expects the German economy to grow by 1.8 percent in 2017 in real terms and by 1.6 percent in 2018.

Setya Novanto, chairman of Indonesia's second-biggest political party, Golkar, made the denial to reporters after a meeting with leaders of the House of Representatives. The speaker said he read media reports saying he was named by the independent Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) as a suspect in the alleged state loss of at least 2.3 trillion rupiah ($173 million) from the identity-card programme. Late on Monday, KPK Chairman Agus Rahardjo told reporters that a legislator with the initials  SN  was suspected to have abused his authority to benefit himself or others while the electronic identity card, known as e-KTP, was put in place in 2011 and 2012.  The KPK always refers to suspects by their initials and never confirms their full names. After Rahardjo's statement, many Indonesian media named Novanto as the suspect the agency is investigating. On Tuesday, Novanto told reporters he would obey the legal process, but said he was  shocked  by the allegations and denied any wrongdoing.   Whatever I'm accused of is not true,  he said.  If they say that I received funds, I've never done that. The sum of that money is incredibly huge. How was it transferred, how was it received?  The KPK has been investigating allegations that sums ranging from $5,000 to $5.5 million - money generated by marking up the costs of the e-KTP procurement - were divided up in a room in parliament.

Antara Foto/Hafidz Mubarak via REUTERSIn March, two public servants on trial for corruption linked to the e-KTP case named at least 37 people, including Novanto, who they said had benefited. The KPK's large-scale investigation, which also implicates members of President Joko Widodo's own ruling party, PDI-P, shows the independence of the anti-graft agency, political analysts say. Despite repeated efforts by politicians to undermine it, the KPK has remained independent and highly popular with the Indonesian public.

Antara Foto/Hafidz Mubarak via REUTERSIt is also seen as crucial for Widodo's drive to battle graft in the country that ranked 90th out of 176 in Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions index last year. The decision to designate Novanto, whose Golkar party is part of Widodo's coalition, as a suspect is  a very positive sign , said Keith Loveard, a Jakarta-based analyst at Concord Consulting.   This most certainly demonstrates how tough the KPK is,  Loveard said, adding that Widodo is unlikely to get in the way of the KPK's investigation in the e-KTP case.  While all the parties are virtually implicated, including the PDI-P, public support for the KPK remains extremely high. So for him to attempt to slow the process or to create obstacles would be very damaging to his popularity,  Loveard added. In late 2015, the parliament's ethics committee launched a probe into allegations by a Freeport Indonesia executive that Novanto had tried to extort $1.8 billion worth of shares from the local unit of the U.S. mining company.  Novanto denied the allegations but stepped down temporarily. He was reappointed as speaker a year later after he was cleared by the parliament's ethics panel.

The 2016 deal has been under public scrutiny since it emerged that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's personal lawyer also represented the local agent of ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems, which was set to build the vessels. Thyssenkrupp said its internal probe of the matter was over for now. It said it was limited by not being allowed to conduct its own investigation in Israel and not having the powers that prosecutors or police have.  Based on the investigative measures we were able to carry out, we found no concrete indications of corruption – neither with regard to submarine projects, nor in connection with the procurement of corvettes,  it said.  However, these investigation results are explicitly provisional,  it added. The steel-to-elevators group declined to comment on Israeli media reports that the signing of the deal by Israel and Germany for the purchase of three submarines had been postponed in the wake of the ongoing corruption investigation in Israel. Officials at both the German chancellery and defense ministry declined comment on the postponement. German government officials have previously declined comment on the investigation and proceedings in Israel, describing it as an internal matter for Israel.   Last week, three suspects were remanded in custody and a fourth ordered held under house arrest after Israeli police questioned six public officials and private citizens on suspicion of corruption relating to the deal. Thyssenkrupp has suspended its relationship with its agent for the deal, Mickey Ganor, and is not currently the subject of German or Israeli investigations, it said.

Myanmar has declined to grant visas to three experts appointed by the United Nations in May to look into allegations of abuses against the powerful armed forces. Last week, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations in New York, Nikki Haley, called on Myanmar to accept the mission, which was mandated in a Human Rights Council resolution.  We dissociated ourselves from the decision because we found that it was less than constructive,  said National Security Adviser Thaung Tun, speaking to U.N. officials and diplomats, including U.S. Ambassador Scot Marciel. The decision of other countries - including China and India - to join Myanmar in distancing themselves from the resolution was a  principled stand , Thaung Tun said.   We feel that that mission can only aggravate the situation on the ground,  he said. The treatment of the roughly one million Muslim Rohingya has emerged as majority Buddhist Myanmar's most contentious rights issue as it makes a transition from decades of harsh military rule. The Rohingya are denied citizenship and classified as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh, despite claiming roots in the region that go back centuries, with communities marginalized and occasionally subjected to communal violence. The government denounces the violence but has done little to improve the lot of the Rohingya. 'Increasing Terrorist Activity' The European Union proposed the investigation after the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights said the army's operation in the northern part of Rakhine State - where most people are Rohingyas - likely included crimes against humanity. Troops fanned out to villages after Rohingya militants killed nine policemen in attacks on border posts in October. The operation sent an estimated 75,000 people across the nearby border to Bangladesh, where many gave accounts of abuses. Reuters was among international media escorted to the area last week in a tour closely overseen by security forces. Rohingya women told reporters of husbands and sons arbitrarily detained, and of killings and arson by security forces that broadly match the accounts from refugees in Bangladesh. Myanmar has largely denied the accusations, and says most are fabricated. Thaung Tun did not directly address the allegations, but said Myanmar had a  clear right to defend the country by lawful means  as it tackles  increasing terrorist activities . Officials say a domestic investigation, led by Vice President Myint Swe, a former lieutenant general, is sufficient. A commission headed by former U.N. chief Kofi Annan is looking into the problems in Rakhine State, but is not tasked with investigating rights abuses. Thaung Tun said the government had started implementing interim recommendations the panel proposed in March, which included shutting camps where more than 120,000 Rohingya have languished since communal violence five years ago.

Software AG aims to play a key role in the so-called industrial internet in which connected machines produce vast amounts of data that need to be processed and analysed, and has invested heavily in its digital business platform (DBP). DBP licence sales, which bring high-margin service and maintenance revenues in their wake, fell 7 percent in the second quarter. DBP maintenance revenues increased by 8 percent, taking overall revenue for the business to 104 million euros ($120 million). Analysts polled by Reuters had expected DBP revenue of 108 million euros - accounting for about half of Software AG's total sales, with the rest split roughly evenly between its legacy database software and consulting. The company said it had had  execution issues  in Britain, where digital licences halved in the second quarter and it contrasted this with triple-digit growth rates in some other countries including Italy and Switzerland.  Disappointment around DBP is likely to outweigh the margin guidance increase,  said UBS analyst Michael Briest, who rates Software AG shares a  buy . Software AG, a distant second to Germany's biggest business software firm SAP, also raised its 2017 operating profit margin target to 31 to 32 percent from previous guidance for 30.5 to 31.5 percent, thanks to the strong digital maintenance. Shares in Software AG rose more than 3 percent in early trading before reversing gains to trade more than 2 percent lower. By 0909 GMT, they were up 0.2 percent at 38.24 euros, outperforming a 0.5 percent lower German mid-cap index. Chief Executive Karl-Heinz Streibich said the Darmstadt-based company's current run at capitalising on the industrial internet should be more successful than its previous attempt in 2013 because the business was more mature.  It took much much longer than we anticipated to monetise that investment,  he told analysts and reporters on a conference call.  Nobody was talking about internet of things then.  In the second quarter, Software AG's operating profit (EBITA) jumped 10 percent to 61 million euros, beating consensus for 58 million in the Reuters poll.

Europe's biggest economy is set for solid expansion in 2017 after growing by 0.6 percent in the first three months, driven by strong private investments, solid household spending and rebounding exports.  Our overall assessment of the economic development in Germany remains unchanged compared to the previous month,  ZEW President Achim Wambach said.  The outlook for the German economic growth in the coming six months continues to be positive,  he added. The Mannheim-based research institute said its monthly survey among German investors showed that economic sentiment deteriorated to 17.5 from 18.6 in June. This undershot a Reuters consensus forecast for a fall to 18.0. A separate gauge measuring investors' assessment of the economy's current conditions dropped to 86.4 from 88.0 last month. This compared with the Reuters consensus forecast  predicting a stable reading. VB Bank analyst Thomas Gitzel attributed the drop to possible currency effects.  German exporters don't like the prospect of a stronger euro. If the euro is rising, export goods become more expensive on world markets,  Gitzel said. The euro has risen above 1.1530 dollar EUR=, a fresh 14-month high, ahead of the next European Central Bank policy meeting on Thursday. The Economy Ministry said last week that the economy will continue to enjoy solid growth in the second quarter, driven by soaring private consumption and higher construction activity while net foreign trade is unlikely to add to the expansion. Analysts expect Germany's gross domestic product to grow by at least 0.6 in the April-June period. The Federal Statistics Office will publish preliminary second quarter GDP growth figures in mid-August.

Yingluck and her Puea Thai Party say the trial is politically motivated, aimed at discrediting a populist movement that has won every election since 2001.  Yingluck's brother Thaksin Shinawatra first introduced the rice programs before he himself was ousted in a 2006 coup. But Yingluck took it a step further by offering to buy rice from farmers at up to 50 per cent above market prices.  The measure helped her sweep to power in the 2011 general election. But government losses from the scheme -- which also distorted global rice prices -- helped fuel protests that led to her removal from power days before the 2014 coup. If found guilty, Yingluck like her brother Thaksin, would be disqualified from becoming premier again. Thaksin has been living in self-imposed exile for 11 years to avoid serving a two-year sentence over a corrupt land deal. That has left political circles guessing who would lead the party in the next election, scheduled for next year, and whether that leader could possibly be someone outside the Shinawatra clan that has dominated the movement until now. Unchallenged in Northeast Farmers from the Shinawatra powerbase in the northeast told Reuters they would vote for the Puea Thai Party again in the next election.  The Yingluck rice scheme made rice farmers prosperous from having a reliable income that came on time,  said Paisan Pachanda, 59, a rice farmer and co-operative leader in Khon Kaen, a major commercial hub that lies on a plateau in the center of the northeast region.  If there's an election . . . people in the northeast will still vote for the Puea Thai Party, even if there is no Shinawatra in the party,  he said. Even the rival Democrat Party concedes Puea Thai remains unchallenged in the Northeast.  Puea Thai Party's political base, its MPs and politicians, have developed strong networks in the northeast,  said Ong-art Klampaiboon, deputy leader of the Democrat Party.  So even if the party changes its leadership it is unlikely that it will affect its strong bonds on the ground,  he told Reuters. Asked about Puea Thai's popularity, Lieutenant General Sansern Kaewkamnerd, a spokesman for the government, said:  The people get to decide who they want to represent them.  Rice Legacy Yingluck, whose government was ousted in a 2014 military coup, faces up to 10 years in jail if found guilty of negligence over her role in the rice program. FILE PHOTO: Former Thai Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra greets supporters as she arrives at the Supreme Court for a trial on criminal negligence looking into her role in a debt-ridden rice subsidy scheme during her administration, in Bangkok, Thailand, August 5, 2016.Jorge Silva/File Photo The last hearing in her 2-year long case will be at a Bangkok court on Friday. A verdict is expected after closing statements are delivered in a few weeks' time.  The rice subsidy scheme was a state policy declared to parliament. Yet the charge has been brought against me alone in a criminal case,  Yingluck told Reuters in a written reply to questions.  No other government has been charged over its public policies,  she said. Yingluck, though banned from politics, remains the unofficial face of the party and toured Thailand extensively last year, meeting with rural supporters. Junta leader Prayuth Chan-ocha, who led the 2014 coup, has made no secret of his disdain for the Shinawatras. In 2010, he favored a heavy-handed approach to an army crackdown on red-shirted Shinawatra supporters that killed more than 90 people. The junta's attempts to repress the Shinawatra clan and its movement, and even introduce its own farm subsidies for the politically-powerful farmers, are not working, many in the rice fields of the northeast say.  The more the military pushes the Puea Thai Party the more sympathy the party gets,  Rotcharin Waratsirisophon, 54, a party member told Reuters in the northeastern province of Khon Kaen. Slideshow (5 Images) Puea Thai is even more popular now.  Next in Line With Yingluck and her brother sidelined for next year's scheduled elections, other potential movement leaders have emerged. One is another of Thaksin's sisters, Monthathip Kovitcharoenkul, 58, a businesswoman. Yingluck has told reporters Monthathip has no interest in politics. The other is veteran politician Sudarat Keyuraphan, 56, a former agriculture minister and a former deputy leader of Thaksin's now-defunct Thai Rak Thai Party. Sources in the party said Sudarat was the favorite but some party members prefer a candidate from within the Shinawatra family. Acting Puea Thai Party secretary-general, Phumtham Wechayachai, said it was too soon to talk about party nominations.  We have to wait until an election date has been confirmed. We can't do much at the moment,  Phumtham told Reuters. Politics has been put on hold in Thailand, partly out of respect for late King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who died last October and whose cremation will take place in October.  The junta, which calls itself the National Council on Peace and Order, has also cracked down on dissent by tightening restrictions on the media and silencing activists through imposing the kingdom's strict lese-majeste and cybercrime laws. Whatever new government comes in will still have to deal with the military. The new constitution the generals have implemented introduces a military-appointed senate and requires any future government to follow the junta's 20-year development plan.

But she has adjusted her approach since arriving last year at the 70-bed North Baldwin Infirmary in rural, southern Alabama.  Low patient admissions and high costs mean the hospital does not have doctors on site around-the-clock to administer anesthesia in the case of an unexpected emergency Cesarean.  As a result, Dr. Arthur performs the surgery if there are any signs of complication, rather than waiting and running the risk that comes with the 20 to 30 minutes it takes for an anesthesiologist to arrive in the middle of the night.   It's better for me to do a C-section when I suspect that something may happen,  she said of her new strategy. “Getting the baby out healthy and happy outweighs some of the risk.”   Physicians in rural communities across America are facing the same tough choices as Dr. Arthur. Hospitals are scaling back services, shutting their maternity wards or closing altogether, according to data from hospitals, state health departments, the federal government and rural health organizations.         Nationally, 119 rural hospitals that have shut since 2005, with 80 of those closures having occurred since 2010, according to the most recent data from the North Carolina Rural Health Research Program.   To save on insurance and staffing costs, maternity departments are often among the first to get shuttered inside financially stressed rural hospitals, according medical professionals and healthcare experts.  “It’s been a slow and steady decline,” said Michael Topchik, the National Leader for the Chartis Center for Rural Health, about maternity ward closings. “It’s very expensive care to offer, especially when it’s lower volume.”      More than 200 maternity wards closed between 2004 and 2014 because of higher costs, fewer births and staffing shortages, leaving 54 percent of rural counties across the United States without hospital-based obstetrics, data from the University of Minnesota’s Rural Health Research Center show.   The trend has escalated recently even though the national healthcare law, known as Obamacare, was designed in part to help rural hospitals thrive. But unpaid patient debt has risen among rural hospitals by 50 percent since the Affordable Care Act was passed, according to the National Rural Health Association, especially in states that decided not to expand Medicaid – the state and federal insurance program for the poor.  The outlook for these hospitals was not poised to improve had Congress approved legislation to replace Obamacare. Senate Republicans’ proposed cuts to Medicaid would have pushed about 150 more rural hospitals into the red, according to the Chartis Center for Rural Health, mainly in states that voted Republican in the last election.  But late on Monday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the Republican effort to repeal and immediately replace Obamacare will not be successful, after two of McConnell's Senate conservatives announced that they would not support the bill.  Pain Felt Beyond the Beltway  The consequences go beyond politics.  When local doctors and midwives leave town, rural women lose access to essential services. Many skip or delay prenatal care that could prevent complications, premature birth or even death. The U.S. infant mortality rate is among the highest in developing countries at 5.8 deaths per 1,000 births.  Dr. Nicole Arthur (R), visits Tariyana Wiggins, a high school teacher, shortly after the birth of Troy O’Brien Williams in the hospital room at the North Baldwin Infirmary, a 70-bed hospital in rural Bay Minette, Alabama, U.S. on June 22, 2017.Jilian Mincer   Pregnant woman in rural areas are more likely to have their deliveries induced or by Cesarean section that, while potentially life-saving, are more expensive and risky than a normal vaginal birth, according to patients, medical professionals and researchers.   Almost a year after her second son’s birth, Courtney Cross is still repaying money she borrowed because of the smaller paychecks and larger gas bills she had from driving 60 minutes each way to a specialist in Mobile, Alabama.  “There were some days I had to reschedule because of the money factor,” said Cross, a medical technician and mother of two, who some months made the trip multiple times. “I had to make money.”     Cross is not alone. The most common reasons for the hospital closures are people and money. More and more people are moving to urban areas in pursuit of work and a better paycheck. And in most states, lower revenue from insurance and U.S. government payments are pushing these hospitals into financial stress, particularly in states that did not build out their Medicaid programs as Obamacare allowed.  Slideshow (6 Images)“The majority of births in rural America are paid for by Medicaid, and Medicaid is not the most generous payer,” said Diane Calmus, government affairs and policy manager for the National Rural Health Association. “For most hospitals it is a money losing proposition.”   This is the main reason why Connie Trujillo shuttered her midwife practice this spring in Las Vegas, New Mexico. The local hospital had closed its maternity ward, and the closest hospital to deliver babies was at least 60 miles away. She sees more elective inductions because the patients live far away and can't afford to go back and forth.  “Some of them just don’t have the resources,” she said. A year after shuttering, the hospital is trying to hire additional staff to reopen the ward.   More Scheduled Deliveries  The number of induced U.S. deliveries nationally has doubled since 1990 to about 23.3 percent, but rates are significantly higher in rural areas, where it is routinely offered to women traveling long distances, especially if the weather is bad.  Induced labor and surgery come at a high cost. Commercial insurance and Medicaid paid about 50 percent more for Cesarean than vaginal births, according to a 2013 Truven Health Analytics report. The report said Medicaid payments for maternal and newborn care for a vaginal birth was $9,131 versus $13,590 for a C-section.     In largely rural West Virginia - where the Summersville Regional Medical Center became the latest hospital to stop delivering newborns earlier this year - elected inductions for first time mothers rose to 28.7 percent in 2015 from 24.1 percent in 2011, according to data provided to Reuters by the West Virginia Perinatal Partnership, a statewide effort to improve care.    Inductions allow the physicians to manage their case loads and timing of deliveries,” said Amy Tolliver, director of the Perinatal Partnership. “We know that inductions are happening in small hospitals that have difficulty with staffing.      To address staffing issues at Dr Arthur’s hospital in Alabama, the facility paid temporary doctors for a year to keep the department open when one of its two maternity doctors stopped doing deliveries.  “It’s important to have access (to obstetrics),” said hospital president Benjamin Hansert, who also organized a group of doctors from Mobile about 40 minutes away to cover some of the shifts so that staff doctors would not always be on call. “Where the mother goes for care, the rest of the family will follow.”   Editing by Caroline Humer and Edward Tobin","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-healthcare-rural-idUSKBN1A30C5"},

Republican leaders in the House of Representatives and the Senate are unlikely to allow the budget deficit to grow, so officials said they now hope for a corporate tax at the low end of a 20 percent to 25 percent range.  It's going to be truly deficit neutral,  House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady told reporters.  We're going for permanence. That means our reforms have to balance in the budget.  Six months into Trump’s presidency, Republicans who control House, Senate and the White House have yet to agree on important features of a tax code overhaul. Under Senate rules, Republicans who want to take advantage of their simple majority and pass tax legislation without Democratic support must show the new policies will not add to the federal deficit after 10 years. Cutting the corporate tax rate to 15 percent from a current 35 percent would cost more than $2 trillion over a decade, according to independent analysts, and that total would be hard to offset when proposals to raise revenue face broad political opposition.  I don’t think there are $2 trillion of politically saleable offsets on the corporate side of the ledger,  said Rohit Kumar, a former aide to Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell who now serves as a principal in the tax policy group at the consulting and accounting firm PwC LLP. Two House Republican proposals could help pay for such a reduction: a border adjustment tax and a proposed elimination of business deduction of debt interest payments. But these face broad opposition from industry and many Republican lawmakers. Administration officials hope the negotiators will agree on a plan by the end of July, convert it to legislation during August, unveil it in September and have Trump sign it into law well before the end of 2017. Independent analysts and lobbyists say a more likely timeline would see the release of tax legislation in October or November and a vote in early 2018. The negotiators, Brady, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, White House economic adviser Gary Cohn, House Speaker Paul Ryan, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Finance Committee Chair Orrin Hatch, have yet to agree on a new corporate tax rate or how to pay for tax cuts. They also have yet to agree on which tax breaks to eliminate or whether to include a controversial border tax on imports. They want to end taxation on the foreign profits of U.S. multinational corporations and must agree on a measure to stop U.S. corporations from moving headquarters and shifting profits overseas. Lobbyists say the group is likely to consider a minimum tax on foreign corporate earnings as an alternative to the border tax. Some Republicans in Congress acknowledge that it will be a challenge to identify tax code changes that can unite party factions now battling over healthcare and a fiscal 2018 budget that includes a legislative tool crucial for passing tax legislation without Democratic votes.  The question is, can we get a framework that has a chance of passage? And the answer to that is, we'll see,  Hatch told reporters after taking part in a principals meeting last week.

The town of 1,600 people in Teton County, just west of the jagged peaks of the Rocky Mountains Teton Range, is getting poised to receive as many as 100,000 visitors on Aug. 21 for the celestial event, said Johnson, who was both excited and worried. Driggs is one of hundreds of towns and cities along a 70-mile arc, stretching from Oregon to South Carolina, that are in the direct path of the moon's shadow. The full eclipse and the sun's corona around the disk of the moon will be visible for a little more than two minutes only to those within this narrow band.  Driggs and other towns like it are scrambling to prepare for the onslaught of curious visitors.  We expect gridlock,  Johnson, 46, said as he drove his pickup truck through town. Tucked amid seed potato and quinoa farms, Driggs normally enjoys a more languid pace of life, with highlights including $5 lime shakes sold on balmy summer days at the corner drug store. But with the impending eclipse, planning has kicked into high gear. To make sure nothing more than the roads will be clogged, Johnson took shipment this month of two massive generators that can be deployed at key spots along the city's sewage system to keep it flowing in case of a power outage.   We are telling our residents to hunker down,  Johnson said.  And while Johnson would have preferred to have taken his family backpacking during the time of the eclipse, he's planning to stay in town in case anything goes wrong. Books and a cardboard cutout representation of the moon eclipsing the sun on August 21, 2017 are seen at a bookstore in Jackson, Wyoming, U.S. July 12, 2017.Ann Saphir'All Hands on Deck' Over on the east side of the Teton Range, authorities are preparing for the day  kind of like a fire,  said Denise Germann, a public information officer at Grand Teton National Park. Estimating crowds is nearly impossible, she said, but  it is an 'all hands on deck' event.   The 480-square-mile park's campsites are completely booked, and it expects visitors to pour in from all over, including the bigger Yellowstone National Park, just north of the path of totality. Grand Teton will waive its $30 entry fee to keep traffic from backing up.  Slideshow (6 Images)Many of the park's 465 summer staff will be posted at trailheads and along roads to warn visitors to brace themselves for failed cellphone service, jammed roads and scarce parking, and to urge them to carry plenty of food and water, as well as bear spray to ward off wildlife. In nearby Moose, Huntley Dornan said the county had warned business owners like him to expect four times the usual number of customers in the days leading up to the eclipse.   I find that hard to believe, but I'm not going to be the guy who has his head in the sand and didn't plan for it,  said Dornan, who runs a restaurant, deli, gas station and wine shop, the last place to get supplies before entering the park from the south.  Dornan plans to park a 48-foot refrigerated trailer stocked with a couple of thousand pounds of pizza cheese, 150 pounds of ground buffalo meat, a few hundred tomatoes, and gallons of ice cream, among other provisions for the expected hordes of tourists.  On eclipse day, only people who paid as much as $100 each to attend his viewing parties will be allowed access to the narrow road on his property that offers a clear view. Security will keep others out. About 14 miles down the highway, in Jackson, Wyoming, Bobbie Reppa expects the family business to be flush with demand. She and her husband run Macy's Services, the only purveyor of portable toilets for miles. The 50 she normally has on hand simply aren't enough.   We'll be bringing them in from as far as Ogden, Utah,  she said. Editing by Ben Klayman and Bernadette Baum","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-eclipse-idUSL1N1JY1T6"},

Reproduction or retransmission in whole or in part is prohibited except by permission. All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch’s factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch’s ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed. The information in this report is provided “as is” without any representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or   a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction.

Wirapol Sukphol, formerly known by his monastic name Luang Pu Nenkham, sparked an uproar in 2013 when a YouTube video appeared showing the then-monk on a private jet with a Louis Vuitton bag, behavior deemed contrary to Buddhist teachings and a monk's vow to shun material goods. Later that year, he was expelled from the monkhood after being accused of having sexual intercourse - a grave offense for monks - with an underage girl. He then fled to the United States.  Investigations led to the filing of charges of child molestation, child abduction, public fraud, money laundering and computer crime against him, police said.    Authorities in the United States will send him back to Thailand tomorrow night,  Paisit Wongmuang, director of the special investigation police division, told reporters. Wirapol was not available for comment and it was not clear if he had a lawyer.  Buddhism is deemed to be one of the three pillars of Thai society alongside the nation and monarchy. Temples remain at the center of the community, especially in the countryside, despite the rapid encroachment of the modern, materialistic world. But the institution that organizes Buddhism and oversees the monkhood has come under scrutiny in recent years after a series of sex and money scandals. The military government has been pushing to bring Buddhism under greater control since March, when an influential temple defied a three-week siege by police searching for its former abbot on money-laundering charges. He is still on the run. This year, the government introduced a bill that appears to significantly reduce the influence of Buddhism's supreme council.  Last month, the National Buddhism Office said it would propose another law to force the country's tens of thousands of temples to declare their finances.

Launched in October by Tradition - the interdealer broking arm of Switzerland's Compagnie Financiere Tradition - the short-term financing platform is one of a growing number of initiatives that aim to address dislocations in the mechanism by which collateral is moved around the system. Liquidity provision from traditional bank sources has deteriorated in response stringent bank capital rules and other post-crisis reforms. That has raised the cost of repo transactions, particularly during reporting periods, for a range of players including asset managers, pension funds, central counterparty clearinghouses, local authorities, government agencies and corporate treasuries. A number of counterparties traded sterling general collateral repo through the CLOB during the June quarter-end, executing at or near the UK base rate, according to the venue. Bid/offer spreads on the platform averaged 3bp around mid, versus a reported 40bp-50bp spread in traditional markets for buyside counterparties. “As access to liquidity remains challenging through traditional channels, Elixium offers an alternative model that allows participants to view and execute directly with each other in a regulated MTF environment,” said Nick McCall, CEO of Elixium. “As our membership continues to grow, the liquidity and pricing benefits will become even more pronounced.” The CLOB provides live markets based on fixed tenor points to create deeper liquidity pools and avoid date-specific liquidity squeezes. The latest execution protocol adds to auctions on standard collateral baskets, request for quote, indications of interest and collateral transformation. The platform is built on TradAir’s cloud-based “Marketplace Technology”, which provides end-to-end infrastructure from price generation and distribution to aggregation and along trading optimisation.

Europe's biggest online-only fashion retailer needs to scale up quickly to compete with e-commerce giant Amazon but preliminary quarterly sales growth of 19-21 percent undershot the Berlin-based company's annual target. In a nod to Amazon's popular Prime service, Zalando on Tuesday announced its own membership scheme. For 19 euros ($21.93) per year, members will get faster delivery, pick-up of returns on demand and personal fashion advice. The  Zet  loyalty programme will start in four German cities. Co-chief executive Rubin Ritter said it will then be rolled out to other countries and Zalando hopes to sign up the most active third of its customers. Zalando has always offered free deliveries and returns and has been trialling free home pick-ups of returns since last year, driven by the belief that this will encourage customers to order more even if higher courier costs might squeeze profits. The company has said heavy investment would keep its earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin this year to 5-6 percent, below original analyst expectations. Zalando, founded in 2008, now delivers 2,000 brands in 15 countries and is expanding deliveries from distribution centres in Germany and France. New warehouses in Poland and Sweden are set to come on stream later this year. Zalando said preliminary second-quarter sales were between 1.091 billion and 1.109 billion euros, compared with an average analyst forecast of 1.1 billion, according to Thomson Reuters SmartEstimates. That marks a slowdown from 23 percent growth in the previous quarter and 26 percent in the fourth quarter of 2016 and is below the 20 to 25 percent growth that Zalando aims to reach on an annual basis. Ritter told Reuters growth in the quarter was also dented by the timing of public holidays and Easter. Zalando shares, which had already taken a hit last month after Amazon launched its push into fashion, were down 7 percent at 0917 GMT, making them the biggest faller on the European retail index. Ritter said the company aimed to meet the sales growth target in the full year as a whole. Britain's ASOS trades at a premium to Zalando as it is seen as better insulated from Amazon as it is more focused on a target audience and sells more own-label clothes. Last week ASOS forecast sales growth for the full 2016-17 year at the upper end of its 30 to 35 percent guided range. Driving Growth Zalando last month set a target to double in size by 2020 as it announced new partnerships that underline its ambition to shift from just selling clothes and accessories to providing logistics, technology and marketing services to fashion brands. Ritter said  gross merchandise value , which includes the use of the Zalando site to sell stock owned by others, would become more relevant as a measure of the company's success over time and should grow faster than direct revenue. Adjusted earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) were at 80 to 86 million euros, compared with average analyst forecasts for 85 million, to give a margin of 7.3 to 7.8 percent. Amazon last month launched a test programme called Prime Wardrobe to allow selected members of its shopping club to order three or more items without paying for them up front, with a week to decide which to keep. Amazon offers a limited home collection service in Britain but charges for each return. Luxury site Net-a-Porter offers a free home pick up service, but it can more easily absorb courier costs with an average order value of over 300 euros - five times that at Zalando.

We cannot comment in detail on ongoing negotiations, but we can confirm that talks have resumed,  a spokesman for Discovery said in an e-mailed statement. Germany's Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung had reported late on Monday that the renewed negotiations were focused on the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, for the moment, but said a cooperation on subsequent Games had become more likely. In 2015, Discovery won the European broadcast rights for the Olympics from 2018 to 2024 for 1.3 billion euros ($1.5 billion), beating national public broadcasters such as the BBC and France Television. It had been expected to pass on some lucrative rights. But last November ARD and ZDF said they would not show the Olympic Games for the first time, having failed to clinch a deal. Discovery said in its statement on Tuesday that its goal was to bring the Olympic Games to a larger audience than ever before.  In Germany, ARD and ZDF have a long tradition of broadcasting the Olympic Games, and both the audience and partners respect the knowledge and experience that they can bring to the table,  it said.  That is why we invited them, also as broadcaster of the 2018 Paralympics, to join us in a broadcaster meeting in Pyeongchang.  ARD/ZDF were not immediately available for comment. Germany's Manager Magazin said last year that initial talks between Discovery and ARD and ZDF had stalled over the price of a sub-licence. The magazine said at the time that ARD and ZDF wanted to pay no more than 100 million euros for the broadcast rights in Germany, while Discovery was demanding at least 150 million.

The firm's Vice President of Public and Government Affairs Erwin Maryoto told Reuters in an email the decision was taken after completing a  technology and market review .  Exxon's exit likely means further delays in developing a field that was first discovered in the 1970s. Difficulties with the field have included contract disputes and the remoteness of the block, which is on the southern edge of the South China Sea. The East Natuna field holds approximately 46 trillion cubic feet of recoverable gas resources, according to Exxon, although it comes with a carbon dioxide content of more than 70 percent - which also increases the cost of extracting useable fuel. State energy firm Pertamina had expected to sign a production sharing contract with ExxonMobil and Thailand's PTTEP for the project last year.  Syamsu Alam, Pertamina's upstream director, said the company has not been informed directly of Exxon's decision, but that it was committed to developing the East Natuna field, once a partner is found.  Surely Pertamina wouldn't be able to develop the block alone, we need a partner,  Alam told Reuters in a text message. Indonesia's government has received a letter from the U.S. oil major on its decision to pull out of the gas block, Wiratmaja Puja, director general of oil and gas at the energy ministry, told reporters.  In the letter, Exxon said developing the block would be  uneconomical for the company under current terms , but it offered to help with technology and technical assistance for the project if needed, according to Puja.      Puja estimated that developing the project under current terms would make its gas too expensive, at about $10-15 per million British thermal units (mmBtu). That compares with spot prices for liquefied natural gas (LNG) in Asia that are currently less than $6 per mmBtu.      The government plans to invite Exxon to discuss the project again, saying it might offer  a special incentive  to make it economically viable, Puja said.  Malaysia's Petronas and France's Total were previously involved with the East Natuna project, but they have both pulled out.  In the past, Pertamina's official has said that developing the East Natuna project could cost up to $40 billion.

State energy firm Pertamina had expected to sign a production sharing contract with ExxonMobil and Thailand's PTTEP for the project last year.  Syamsu Alam, Pertamina's upstream director, said the company has not been informed directly of Exxon's decision, but that it was committed to developing the East Natuna field, once a partner is found.  Surely Pertamina wouldn't be able to develop the block alone, we need a partner,  Alam told Reuters in a text message. Indonesia's government has received a letter from the U.S. oil major on its decision to pull out of the gas block, Wiratmaja Puja, director general of oil and gas at the energy ministry, told reporters.  In the letter, Exxon said developing the block would be  uneconomical for the company under current terms , but it offered to help with technology and technical assistance for the project if needed, according to Puja.      Puja estimated that developing the project under current terms would make its gas too expensive, at about $10-15 per million British thermal units (mmBtu). That compares with spot prices for liquefied natural gas (LNG) in Asia that are currently less than $6 per mmBtu.      The government plans to invite Exxon to discuss the project again, saying it might offer  a special incentive  to make it economically viable, Puja said.  Malaysia's Petronas and France's Total were previously involved with the East Natuna project, but they have both pulled out.  In the past, Pertamina's official has said that developing the East Natuna project could cost up to $40 billion.

Analysts said investors were taking the opportunity to take a long position - essentially a bet that an asset will strengthen in price - over the summer months given the higher yields offered by lower-rated southern European bond markets. Spain's 10-year bond yield fell 4 basis points to a two-week low at 1.548 percent, pushing the gap over German Bund yields to around 98 basis points - the tightest since September 2016.  The consensus is that in the absence of negative drivers, one should enjoy the positive carry offered by peripheral bonds and go long,  said Richard McGuire, head of rates strategy at Rabobank.

NOC Chairman Mustafa Sanalla will share with a technical committee  the factors enabling and constraining Libya's production recovery , he said in a statement.  I will consult with significant Libyan decision-makers before I leave and hope to present a unified Libyan position in St Petersburg that will show we can act together in the national interest,  Sanalla said. The technical committee involving six OPEC and non-OPEC members is due to convene before ministers from the countries hold talks in the Russian city on July 24. OPEC members Libya and Nigeria have boosted production since they were exempted from an OPEC-led deal to cut output, weighing on global prices.  That prompted talk among producers about including them in the pact, though Kuwait's OPEC governor Haitham Al-Ghais said on Friday it would be premature to cap Libyan and Nigerian production. Sanalla has said Libya's political, humanitarian and economic problems must be considered in any discussion about limiting the country's output. Libya's oil production is fluctuating at just over 1 million barrels per day, still well under the 1.6 million bpd the North African country was producing before its 2011 uprising.

The National Development and Reform Commision (NDRC) said in a statement it would  properly deal  with the impact of cutting capacity in the world's top consumer of the fuel, and would try to stabilise supplies and prevent supply disruptions.  While ensuring mine safety, China will release quality-coal capacity in an orderly way to boost coal supply... A total of around 200 million tonnes of net increased coal capacity will be launched this year,  the NDRC statement said. This included 90 million tonnes of coal capacity already added in the first half of the year, the statement said. More projects were under construction and expected to be operating by the end of the year. The comments come as thermal coal futures have surged this year, hitting record highs above 600 yuan per tonne amid fears that supplies would fail to meet demand during a prolonged heatwave across the north of the country. The statement reflects the government's challenge in removing excess coal capacity from the market while at the same time ensuring stable supply.  There is an uneasiness in China to quickly drive prices lower by bringing on new supply into the market,  said Prakash Sharma, who heads Wood Mackenzie's China research.  However, this would mean reversing the hard work done on coal sector reforms and increasing uncertainty for the global coal market.  The NDRC said earlier on Tuesday it had cut 111 million tonnes of coal capacity by the end of June, some 74 percent of its 2017 target.

The FTSE 100 was up 0.2 percent by 0845 GMT, propelled higher by a weaker pound as investors adjusted interest rate expectations after lower inflation figures. Inflation unexpectedly eased in June for the first time since October, surprising the market and adding to the likelihood the Bank of England will keep interest rates on hold in August.  The Bank of England's rhetoric has taken an increasingly hawkish tone in recent weeks,  said Hargreaves Lansdown senior economist Ben Brettell.  However if today's pullback in inflation marks the start of a sustained decline, the pressure on the Bank to raise rates will ease.  Major companies on the FTSE 100 benefit from a weaker pound making their exports relatively cheaper abroad. Britain's second-largest listed property developer British Land was a top blue-chip performer, as investors cheered a 300 million share buyback plan which added to signs of a pick-up in share buybacks among European corporates, a trend Morgan Stanley analysts last week predicted would accelerate.  British Land's 300 million pound buyback confirms the limited opportunities the group sees to deploy surplus capital into its end-markets,  said Liberum analysts.  Given the significant discount to net asset value at which the shares are trading, this would be NAV accretive with the scale of enhancement subject to the amount of share bought and at what price,  said analysts at Stifel. A flurry of mail activity around the UK election helped Royal Mail perform better this quarter, sending its shares up 3.1 percent to the top of the FTSE.  We remain concerned that parcels growth is not fast enough to offset the decline in letters,  said Liberum analsyts, who have a 'sell' on the stock. Mid-cap IG Group jumped 9 percent to the top of the STOXX, after the spreadbetter firm released a better than expected statement.  We regard these as very solid results in a year where market volatility has been at a multi-year low,  said Shore Capital analysts. Greater market volatility tends to bolster trading firms' profits as jittery investors turn portfolios around more frequently. Crisis-hit British construction firm Carillion again led mid-caps, jumping 12 percent after its joint venture won two further contracts, worth 158 million pounds, to supply services for British military sites. The stock was now up 50 percent from last week's lows. Defence contractor G4S rose to the top of the FTSE 100 as investors read across from Carillion's gains.

MSCI's benchmark emerging stocks index held at levels not seen since end-April 2015, still underpinned by Monday's solid Chinese economic growth data, which beat consensus forecasts and showed firmer exports and production. Chinese mainland shares rose 0.3 percent after falling 1.4 percent on Monday due to a sharp sell off in small caps, and Hong Kong gained 0.2 percent. Russian dollar-denominated stocks also rose 0.4 percent, helped by higher oil prices. But gains were offset by losses in other markets. Turkish stocks fell 0.5 percent and Indian shares slipped 0.6 percent from the record highs hit in the previous session. Higher taxes on cigarette makers clobbered index heavyweight ITC. Emerging currencies made marginal gains after the dollar slipped 0.4 percent against a basket of currencies, hit by the failure of the revised U.S. healthcare reform bill .  (It raises) doubts about President Trump's ability to reflate the economy,  said Inan Demir, senior emerging economist at Nomura. Fading U.S. rate hike bets have also weighed on the dollar after Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen indicated the Fed's rate hikes could be gradual.  Emerging market currencies have already benefited from a strong risk appetite since Yellen's speech last week, which was followed up by the weak CPI data,  Demir added.  Even though the (healthcare bill) failure led to a broad-based dollar weakness, the incremental impact on EM currencies from this is limited given that they have already rallied.  Higher-yielding currencies in Asia were among the beneficiaries, with the Thai baht hitting a two-year high and the South Korean won gaining 0.3 percent to touch a one-month high. China's yuan also firmed for the seventh straight session. Both the South African rand and Turkish lira held near two-week highs. On Monday Turkey extended emergency rule for another three months, almost a year after it was imposed in the wake of last July's failed military coup. The Hungarian forint was steady against the euro ahead of a central bank meeting at which it is expected to keep rates on hold at record lows of 0.9 percent. The International Bank of Azerbaijan, the country's biggest state-run bank, will announce full voting results from creditors on its proposed $3.3 billion debt restructuring after a claimants' meeting later in the day. Meanwhile President Trump has threatened  strong and swift economic actions  if Venezuela goes ahead with plans to create a Constituent Assembly with powers to rewrite the constitution and annul the opposition-led legislature.  With FX reserves below $10 billion for the first time since 2002 and the economy falling further into an abyss, it is only trade partners who can have a say now,  Simon Quijano-Evans, an emerging markets strategist at Legal & General Investment Management, said in a note, pointing out that almost 40 percent of the country's exports go to the United States.

The radio syllabus is providing lessons on literacy and numeracy, and staying safe amid the violence, to about 200,000 displaced and out-of-school children in the Far North region of Cameroon and Niger's southern Diffa region, according to UNICEF.  The level of boredom among children in camps for the displaced is tremendous,  said UNICEF spokesman Patrick Rose.  With this radio education program, children will receive lessons in a structured way, that keeps them in a rhythm ... so that when they go back to school they won't be so far behind,  Rose told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone from Dakar. Boko Haram, whose name loosely means 'Western education is sinful', has killed more than 600 teachers and forced over 1,200 schools to close during its eight-year insurgency in Nigeria, Niger, Cameroon and Chad, according to the U.N. agency. Three years ago, the abduction of more than 200 schoolgirls by the jihadist group in Chibok in northeastern Nigeria sparked global outrage a celebrity-backed campaign #bringbackourgirls. The project - backed by the European Union and governments of Cameroon and Niger - is engaging community leaders to share available radios and bring children together for the lessons. About 150 lessons are being broadcast in both French and the local languages of Kanouri, Fulfulde and Hausa, UNICEF said.  In the very near future, we hope that children who learn by radio will also receive a certification and pass the school year,  said Marie-Pierre Poirier, UNICEF's regional director.  Beyond radio broadcasts, school teachers across the region have been trained by UNICEF to identify and respond to security threats to protect children from Boko Haram, and to provide traumatized children with psychological support. Boko Haram has killed more than 20,000 people and some 2.7 million people have been uprooted from their homes since 2009 as a result of the group's attempt to create an Islamic state. The militants have been driven out of most of the territory they held in early 2015, yet continue to carry out bombings and raids in northeast Nigeria, as well as in Cameroon and Niger.

The $4 trillion blueprint, which must be approved by both the House and Senate, would also set the stage for a Republican-only repeal of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law and $203 billion in savings from mandatory federal programs including food stamps over the next decade. The plan aims to move the U.S. fiscal position from a $472 billion deficit in 2018 to a $9 billion budget surplus in 2027. The change is based in part on a committee forecast of 2.6 percent annual U.S. economic growth that assumes future changes in tax, healthcare and financial laws, as well as deregulation. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has forecast economic growth of 1.9 percent from 2017 to 2027. Covering the year beginning Oct. 1, the budget plan represents the latest Republican attempt to show they can govern since the party took control of both the White House and Congress in January. But the cloud of party infighting already hangs over those prospects. The House and Senate are still struggling to enact legislation to dismantle and replace Obamacare and have not yet addressed other priorities including spending legislation for 2018 or a measure to raise the federal debt limit. The House budget plan would spend $621.5 billion on defense and $511 billion on nondefense discretionary spending in 2018. The House Budget Committee is expected to approve the plan later this week and send it to the floor of the chamber for a full vote. But conservative lawmakers are already balking over mandatory cuts they think are too small and demanding to see a tax reform plan before supporting the measure. The plan is vital to Republican aims of overhauling the U.S. tax code while avoiding a Democratic filibuster in the Senate. The plan requires the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee to find $52 billion in savings, a directive that allows Republicans to pass a tax bill with a simple majority in the Senate, which they control by a 52-48 seat margin. Without reconciliation, tax reform would require 60 Senate votes. A $14 billion savings instruction for the House Financial Services Committee would allow the same procedure for legislation to replace Dodd-Frank, which passed the House in June.

The PayNet Small Business Lending Index rose to 124.2 in May from 121.9 the month before. Compared to a year ago the index was up 5 percent, its second straight month of annual gains. Lending to medium-sized businesses also picked up, rising to 235.1 from 234.5 in April. Increased lending was seen in most provinces, including Alberta and Saskatchewan, which are sensitive to the energy sector. The drop in oil prices put Canada in a brief recession in 2015 but economic growth has rebounded, prompting the central bank to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly seven years last week.  Canadian business is back,  said PayNet President Bill Phelan.  It certainly is very positive for future growth because you have all these sectors contributing, it's not just an energy-driven economy.  The gauge of lending to agriculture companies rose to 208.3 from 200.7 while the accommodation and food sector increased to 217.4 from 214.5. Lending to construction companies rose to 140.6 from 137.9 as groundbreaking on new homes has been strong this year, despite signs of cooling in some parts of Canada's housing market. The financial health of Canadian companies continued to look strong, with the share of small companies that were behind 30 days or more on their loans holding steady at 1.09 percent. Those that were 90 days or more in arrears dipped to 0.32 percent from 0.35 percent.

We expect continued growth in (Transneft) dividend payouts in the next few years,  Dmitriev told Interfax, adding that the potential share conversion would help the company to tap  new world markets, including Asian ones . The conversion plan was confirmed in an RDIF statement.  The RDIF considers it expedient to consider the issue of converting Transneft preferred shares into ordinary ones,  RDIF said.  This will allow us to significantly raise shareholder value and share liquidity.  Sovereign wealth funds from the Middle East have bought into Transneft along with the RDIF, Dmitriev told Interfax without elaborating.

The manner of Fitch’s factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors.

The former street hawker from Guinea now works as a caterer in Venice, rents his own apartment, and sends money back home regularly to his mother and siblings in the West African nation.  I am happy I came to Europe, and my family is also happy,  he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation as he packed up leftovers at a training event for people who work with refugees, where he had served a menu which included traditional African dishes.   I talk to my family frequently, ask them their needs, and help them however I can,  added the Guinean refugee. Yet about 40 km (25 miles) from the city, standing outside a former army barracks housing hundreds of asylum seekers, Osayi, a 35-year-old from Nigeria, is preparing to head into the heart of Venice to beg for money from tourists.   If I knew that things were like this, I would never have come,  said Osayi, who arrived in Italy six months ago, dreaming of providing a better life for his wife and children back home. Muhammed and Osayi are among more than 600,000 migrants, mainly from sub-Saharan Africa, who over the past four years have made it to Italy, the main arrival point in Europe for people fleeing conflict, persecution and poverty in Africa. Italy has won praise for its handling of these newcomers, yet a recent surge in arrivals has piled pressure on the government, shifted public perceptions amid growing tensions, and caused friction with other European Union countries. Amid this political uncertainty in Italy - where asylum applications are slow to be processed, migrants are herded into detention centers and few job opportunities exist - tens of thousands of migrants, such as Osayi, fear for their future.  Really Suffering       Activists fear for the fate of 175,000 asylum seekers across Italy after its center-right parties were the big winners in recent mayoral elections - a setback for the ruling center-left Democratic Party less than a year before national elections. Italy last month appealed to the European Union for help in taking in African migrants, even raising the possibility of closing its ports to humanitarian rescue ships to pressure EU partners, sources familiar with the matter said.  There is a very large populist front that polluted the debate on migration,  said Stefano Bleggi of Melting Pot, a civil society group focused on migration.  As a consequence, progressive parties ... have started to use the worst slogans and thoughts in their electoral campaigns - they also see migration as a problem for people's security.  Despite Venice's history of welcoming foreigners and its reputation as a sanctuary city for migrants and refugees, success stories such as Muhammed's seem to be few and far between as arrivals from Africa come ashore at record pace. A record 181,000 migrants reached the country by boat last year. About 85,000 newcomers have arrived from Libya this year so far, roughly 20 percent up on the same period in 2016. This influx has overwhelmed cities across Italy, such as Venice, with many asylum seekers packed into detention centers which activists have criticized as unhygienic and inhumane. Earlier this year, migrants in Cona, near Venice, barricaded staff inside a reception center to protest living conditions after the death of a woman in the facility designed for 15 migrants that housed up to 1,500 people.  They give us pasta for breakfast, lunch and dinner,  said Osayi, who sleeps in a bunk bed in the imposing ex-military building he shares with about 800 other asylum seekers.   There are no jobs - we are really suffering,  added Osayi, who did not disclose his surname because of his asylum request.  Overcoming Hatred Worsening attitudes from the Italian public towards migrants are not just exacerbated by the upswing in arrivals, but also by the huge and often intimidating centers in which they are housed, said Carlo Geromel, a mediator with Cooperativa Sociale.  If you see detention centers that look like Nazi camps or ghettos, it is evident that people will get worried,  he said. His organization works in smaller centers that house no more than 20 people, and connects them with local associations, volunteer and job opportunities, and vocational training.   In this way the local population has the opportunity to meet them, speak with them and overcome the hate,  Geromel said. Yet hostility from the public towards migrants and refugees is still rife, and many people oppose the government's plans to redistribute asylum seekers across the country, activists say. Last November, residents of the small village of Gorino, about 100 km (62 miles) south of Venice, set up makeshift roadblocks to prevent a small group of migrant women and children being given accommodation in a hostel. And earlier this year, Italian magistrates launched an investigation after a video was posted online showing an African man drowning in Venice's Grand Canal as onlookers watched from nearby boats, with no-one jumping in to help him. Many asylum seekers fear the worst after former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, leader of the Democratic Party, said this month that Italy had no moral duty to host migrants, and urged the nation to escape its 'do-gooder mentality'. Newcomers such as Osayi not only face such negative rhetoric from politicians and the Italian public, but also from older migrants who left Africa years ago before settling in Italy.  Because of them, it's now so difficult to rent a place,  said Alexander Akinmoladun, a Nigerian caretaker at the center where Osayi lives, who has worked in Italy for almost 10 years.  Once people hear that you're Nigerian, they say they don't want you to rent their place. These refugees are a nuisance.

A middle-aged woman, trudging through waist-deep floodwater, clutched a rooster carefully above the torrent, while a small girl struggled to hold onto the woman’s waist, at times barely able to keep her head above water. “Not just the public, but even policy makers are the same: They look at natural disasters as isolated events and the main aim is to save movable and immovable property, not lives,” charged Ranjith Punyawardena, the head of climatology in the agricultural department of Sri Lanka’s University of Peradeniya. Disasters – from deadly floods to worsening droughts – are happening more frequently in Sri Lanka. But efforts to begin treating the crises as a new “normal” – which requires fundamental changes to how the country’s systems work, rather than one-time responses – is struggling, some officials say. In May, floods and landslides killed 216 people, left 76 missing and affected over 600,000 - just a year after similar floods killed more than 100 people. A 10- month drought, meanwhile, is lingering in the northern part of the island – despite some recent rain – and is likely to result in the 2017 rice harvest being the lowest in a decade, according to the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization. One of the main problems, Punyawardena said, is the difficulty of sustaining changes put in place in the wake of disasters. Real Change? In each of the last three years floods have killed at least a hundred people in Sri Lanka, and in each case disaster officials have initiated inquiries afterward to identify what went wrong, Punyawardena said.  After this year’s flooding, Sri Lanka’s Disaster Management Centre and Department of Meteorology were widely criticized for failing to provide sufficient early warnings of the approaching floods. Officials at the Department of Meteorology said a lack of sophisticated radar technology prevented it from issuing detailed-enough warnings. The disaster center has since revamped its procedures for issuing early warnings and the government has signed a $ 22 million agreement with Japan to set up new weather radar stations.  The government also has said it will set up 100 disaster evacuation centers across the island nation. But Punyawardena said it remained to be seen whether such action would cut the death toll from floods in coming years. “Hopefully these new changes will not end like sudden bursts. We need sustained emphasis. The policies have been there in the past as well. It is the implementation that has been lacking,” he said. The problem, said Punyawardena  and Sarath Premalal, director general of the Department of Meteorology, is that disasters usually lead to a flurry of government activity that then peters out as the disaster situation eases. The cycle then begins again with the next disaster, they said. “The policies are clearly there in documents and plans. I don’t think we need newer ones. What we need is to properly implement these for the long haul,” Punyawardena said.  Disaster officials say one big problem for them is lack of access to top-level decision makers as they try to bring change. Normally such access comes only during major disasters, Premalal said. “We need support at the very top level to make sure we are prepared. Sometimes it is very difficult to gain access to decision makers. That slows down a lot of the work,” he said. Working Together Lack of coordination can also be a problem. During May’s floods, for instance, both the country’s president and its prime minister chaired separate committees aimed at addressing the disaster, leading to confusion in the early stages of the crisis, according to Disaster Management Centre officials and officials of United Nations relief organizations. Getting officials from across agencies – such as agriculture, water, disaster and meteorology – together to coordinate plans also is a challenge, Premalal said.  “We tend to still work in silos. There is a need  for practical, real-time data and information sharing,” he said. Since 2010, government agencies have come together to hold a pre-monsoon meeting each March to share and discuss information on expected rainfall. The problem is that very little activity then takes place to head off problems that might be anticipated from the data, said the head of the meteorological department. For example, data provided by the Department of Meteorology before the May floods suggested very heavy rainfall was possible, and should have led to the country’s Department of Irrigation running computer models on what flooding might be expected, Punyawardena said. Currently the irrigation department  relies primarily on water gauges in rivers to assess water levels and determine when flood alerts should be issued, he said. M. Thuraisingham, director general of the irrigation department, said that his team did not have the technical capacity or human resources to accurately run computer models of possible flooding. Anura Priyadarshana Yapa, Sri Lanka’s minister of disaster management, said efforts to better spur and coordinate action are underway, however. “At ministry level we are now having regular meetings with all connected departments and if the need arises we will seek (a) meeting with the President,” he said.  He noted that the government had also renewed its pioneering national natural disaster insurance policy, which last year earned the country a $2 million payout amid floods just six weeks after being purchased.  The country also is seeking help to improve its weather radar network, he said.

The company, which owns the Meadowhall shopping centre in Sheffield and office property at Paddington Central in London, said its shares were trading at a substantial discount to its net asset value, making a buyback a  clear value opportunity .  Investment in the company's shares at the prevailing discount offers better value than further asset acquisitions,  Britain's second-largest listed property developer said in a statement ahead of its general meeting. The company's shares were the second-top London gainers, up 3 percent at 622 pence by 0824 GMT, but still about 30 percent lower than the firm's EPRA net asset value of 915 pence per share as of March 31. Rival Land Securities was up 1.5 percent at 1,025 pence. British Land and Land Securities, both large holders of London office property, have seen the value of their assets fall since the country's vote to leave the European Union last year. The outcome of the referendum has raised concerns that the worth and allure of London property might be hit by the departure of financial companies to Europe. In response, British Land has been reducing the amount of space it was developing before securing tenants. Chief Executive Chris Grigg said on Tuesday that the company had the flexibility to respond to a changing market and was retaining resources to develop its pipeline of opportunities. British Land's buyback comes a decade after the company's former chief executive announced a 500 million pound buyback, citing similar market conditions, only to quickly shelve plans.  2017 looks like a rerun of 2007 and Grigg's gamble of running more leverage risk anticipating an extended real estate cycle is faltering as global bond yields rise,  Jefferies analyst Mike Prew said in a note.

Yesterday, the Venezuelan people again made clear that they stand for democracy, freedom and rule of law. Yet their strong and courageous actions continue to be ignored by a bad leader who dreams of becoming a dictator,  Trump said in a statement issued by the White House.  The United States will not stand by as Venezuela crumbles. If the Maduro regime imposes its Constituent Assembly on July 30, the United States will take strong and swift economic actions,  Trump said. Maduro's foes are demanding a presidential election and want to stop the leftist leader's plan to create the Constituent Assembly, which would have the power to rewrite the constitution and annul the opposition-led legislature. On Sunday, 98 percent of opposition supporters in an unofficial vote rejected the proposed assembly.

Senior White House officials told Reuters last month the Trump administration was considering sanctions on Venezuela's vital energy sector, including state oil company PDVSA, a major escalation in U.S. efforts to pressure the country's government amid a crackdown on the opposition. The idea of striking at the core of Venezuela’s economy, which relies on oil for some 95 percent of export revenues, has been discussed at high levels of the administration as part of a wide-ranging review of U.S. options. The White House officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters the United States could hit PDVSA as part of a “sectoral” sanctions package that would take aim at the OPEC nation’s entire energy industry for the first time. They made clear the administration was moving cautiously, mindful that if such an unprecedented step was taken, it could deepen the country’s economic and social crisis, in which millions suffer food shortages and soaring inflation. Another complicating factor would be the potential impact on oil shipments to the United States, for which Venezuela is the third largest oil supplier after Canada and Saudi Arabia. It accounted for 8 percent of U.S. oil imports in March, according to U.S. government figures.

When it still hadn't rained at the beginning of spring we realized it was already irreparable,  he said, adding that he had installed fans to try and cool his cows that were suffering in the heat. Drought in southern Europe threatens to reduce cereal production in Italy and parts of Spain to its lowest level in at least 20 years, and hit other regional crops including olives and almonds. Castile and Leon, the largest cereal growing region in Spain, has been particularly badly affected, with crop losses estimated at around 60 to 70 percent.  This year was not bad, it was catastrophic. I can't remember a year like this since 1992 when I was a little child,  said Joaquin Antonio Pino, a cereal farmer in Sinlabajos, Avila. Pino said many of his fields had not even been harvested, because crop revenues would not cover the wages of laborers who gathered them. While the EU is collectively a major wheat exporter, Spain and Italy both rely on imports from countries including France, Britain and Ukraine. Spanish soft wheat imports are expected to rise by more than 40 percent to 5.6 million tonnes in the 2017-2018 marketing year, according to Agroinfomarket. The drought has helped support EU wheat futures, which have risen around 6 percent since the beginning of June, although the prospect of a larger harvest in France this year should ensure adequate overall supplies in the trading bloc. Scorched Olives Spain and Italy are also among the world's top producers of olive oil. Production in both countries is expected to fall, but the decline is likely to be particularly steep in Italy, where drought is the latest headache for olive growers already plagued by insects and a bacterial disease in recent years.

We expected good production this year, but it hasn't turned out like that,  said Francesco Suatoni, who tends about 4,000 olive trees on the fringe of the ancient town of Amelia, in Umbria, central Italy. Holding up a branch with small, shriveled pods on it he added:  Each little ball could have been an olive, but it's scorched.  This year we expect to produce 50 percent less than last year. Let's hope not, but it will be very difficult to have a good crop.  Slideshow (17 Images)Other crops have been damaged, and Italy's agricultural association Coldiretti has estimated the drought could cost the nation's farmers more than 1 billion euros.  The drought is affecting, to a greater or lesser extent, all crops in Spain, even those that rely on greenhouses, because there's a limit on the amount of water available,  said Jose Ugarrio, analyst at the Spanish young farmers' association. The production of nuts such as almonds and pistachios has also fallen sharply.  We expect a 23 pct drop in almond production this year from last year,  Ugarrio said. Some see rising temperatures as a long-term trend, which threatens the viability of farming in the region.  In this situation ... you realize it's almost impossible to keep going. You think OK, this year I will try to manage, but if the harvest is like this next year you won't be able to cope any more,  said farmer Tocchi, who is also the local head of farmers' group Confagricoltura. Some scientists have said heat waves like this year's are becoming more frequent, and are linked to man-made climate change.  This is the first year we have watered the plants. There was never any need before,  said olive grower Suatoni.

The broader euro zone earnings picture was expected to weaken slightly in the third quarter as analysts see a stronger currency likely weighing on the bloc's large exporting companies.

Nationwide, home price growth slowed slightly last month as government restrictions to keep prices in check weighed on larger cities, though smaller cities maintained rapid growth due to less severe checks.  Big cities such as Beijing have acted swiftly this year to quell speculative property buying that have shattered price records and fueled concerns about housing affordability. Worries about growing household leverage have been joined by anxiety over China's addiction to debt, which authorities have been trying to curb over the past year in an effort to defuse financial risks.  The latest data suggests the real estate sector is cooling off at a moderate pace and is unlikely to suffer a steep correction as some had feared. In June, average new home prices in China's 70 major cities rose 10.2 percent from a year earlier, decelerating from May's 10.4 percent gain, according to Reuters calculations based on data issued by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). On a monthly basis, new home prices rose 0.7 percent in June, the same as the previous month's reading, the  calculations showed.  Sales declines in the biggest cities were quite significant, so prices are certainly not going to rebound,  said Rosealea Yao, a property economist with Gavekal Dragonomics.  The mild declining trend will continue through at least the first half of 2018,  Yao said. More than 45 cities, most of them top-tier cities with a sizable population, have imposed varying levels of restrictions since last October to curb fast-rising prices, with most of the latest measures introduced in late March.  The cooling effect is most visible in China's the biggest cities. Price growth in Shenzhen, Shanghai and Beijing slowed to 2.7 percent, 8.6 percent and 10.7 percent, respectively, from a year earlier. From a month earlier, prices in Beijing fell 0.4 percent, marking the first fall since February 2015. Shanghai prices slipped by a further 0.2 percent, while Shenzhen prices remained unchanged. FILE PHOTO: Apartment blocks and villas (bottom) are pictured in Wuqing District of Tianjin, China September 10, 2016.Jason Lee/File PhotoDeclining Sales The value of new personal home mortgages in Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen in the first half of 2017 was equal to 30 percent of the total value of home loans in 2016, a Chinese state newspaper reported. Still, real estate investment and sales growth both sped up in June after slowing in May, most likely due to more robust demand in smaller centers that have been encouraged to reduce inventory and are not subject to the strict curbs at work in bigger cities. Luoyang, a third-tier city in central Henan province, topped the list in June, with prices of new units up 2.3 percent on month, compared with a 1.3 percent gain in May, taking the annual growth to 10.2 percent.   That has also been reflected in stronger credit demand in the month from households. Keeping a lid on price fluctuations has become a priority for policymakers in a politically important year, with a major leadership reshuffle expected this autumn. But to make sure the market is neither too hot nor too cold, authorities have increasingly resorted to administrative measures that many analysts warn are anti-market in nature. For example, sales prices for new units in a few cities like Zhengzhou - capital of Henan - are not allowed to be higher than the price level seen last October for new units in the vicinity.     Fading Affordability  The upsurge in house prices since 2001 in most major Chinese cities has spurred growing concerns about affordability. A typical two-bedroom new home in Beijing now costs around 6 million yuan ($870,000), about 69 times the average per capita disposable income in the city, much higher than the ratio of less than 25 times for New York City.  Economists worry that slowing growth in incomes, which had been rising at double-digit rates for decades, will no longer be able to cushion financial risks in an extremely inflated housing market. On average, China's disposable income was up 8.1 percent on-year for city-dwellers in the first half of the year, official data showed, slower than the 10.2 percent annual property price growth in June.

The family has lodged an appeal with the Tokyo High Court, their lawyer said, calling the ruling  unjust . The descendents of the Idemitsu founder, Sazo Idemitsu, have been locked in a battle with the Japanese refiner's management for more than a year over the proposed Showa Shell buyout. The new share sale would dilute the family's stake and make it harder for them to oppose the deal. Idemitsu, however, has earlier said it planned to sell 48 million new shares, equivalent to 30 percent of its outstanding shares, mainly to raise funds and help repay loans. The court recognizes the management's intention to dilute the founding family's stake, according to court papers seen by Reuters. But it also recognizes the firm's need to raise funds to repay 159 billion yen ($1.42 billion) in loans - taken to buy Showa Shell shares - that will be up for redemption on Dec. 18.  Idemitsu, Japan's No.2  refiner by sales, in December 2016 completed the purchase of just under a third of Showa Shell, the first stage in its buyout of the smaller competitor. It had planned to refinance the debt with subordinated loans but lenders have refused to provide it with the terms they had previously agreed, following the founding family's firm opposition to the deal, the court paper shows.  The court cannot categorically determine the main objective of the new share issue is to enhance management's position, rather than to raise fund,  according to the paper.  The new share sale, calculations by Thomson Reuters show, would cut the founding family's stake in Idemitsu to about 26 percent, from more than a third now, eliminating its ability to veto the Showa deal. The family says the two firms' cultures will not mesh. If the deal goes through, it would be the second in Japan's bloated refining sector after JX Holdings Inc bought TonenGeneral Sekiyu.  Idemitsu shares ended down 3 percent at 2,646 yen, while Showa Shell gained 4.4 percent. The Nikkei 225 closed down 0.6 percent.

Colorado scored seven times in the first three innings, then held on for a 9-6 win over the San Diego Padres on Monday night at Coors Field. Trevor Story drove in three runs, and Charlie Blackmon hit his fourth leadoff homer among three hits as the Rockies followed up their 13-4 rout of the New York Mets on Sunday by winning for the seventh time in 22 games. The win enabled the Rockies (54-41) to move within a half game of the idle Arizona Diamondbacks for the top National League wild-card spot and maintain their 5 1/2-game lead over the Chicago Cubs for the second wild-card berth. Gerardo Parra hit his eighth home run, giving him seven consecutive games with at least one RBI and 11 in that span since coming off the disabled list. Since being reinstated after missing 28 games due to a right quad strain, Parra is 13-for-28 (.464). The Rockies held a 7-2 lead after three innings but were forced to use four pitchers in the eighth after the Padres scored three times. Related CoveragePreview: Padres at RockiesSan Diego Padres - PlayerWatchColorado Rockies - PlayerWatchHector Sanchez hit a solo homer off Jake McGee, Jabari Blash lifted a sacrifice fly, and Allen Cordoba hit an RBI single off Adam Ottavino to cut Colorado's lead to 8-6. Scott Oberg gave up a single before Mike Dunn recorded the out of the inning. DJ LeMahieu's sacrifice fly in the bottom of the eighth gave closer Greg Holland a three-run cushion. Holland gave up a two-out double but earned his 29th save in 30 opportunities. The Rockies knocked out Padres starter Luis Perdomo (4-5) after 2 1/3 innings. Perdomo allowed seven runs (five earned) and six hits.  He clearly wasn't his typical self,  Padres manager Andy Green said.  He didn't have his normal sink, wasn't locating really much of anything. I think he got squared up a few times in the first inning and after that kind of pitched away from contact. And he's a guy that's always pitched to contact, always gotten ground balls. But even the balls that were hit in the first, most of those were in the air, and that's not his M.O.  Colorado's German Marquez (7-4) allowed three runs and eight hits in 6 2/3 innings. He tied a career high with nine strikeouts and walked two. Marquez gave up a two-run homer to Blash in the second -- a 477-foot shot to center, the longest home run at Coors Field this season -- but seemed to find a groove after third baseman Nolan Arenado started an inning-ending double play in the third with a nifty stop. Marquez packed five of his strikeouts from the fourth through the sixth when he retired nine of the 11 batters he faced.  My fastball at first wasn't working as well,  Marquez said through a translator.  Once I got into the third inning, I had really good command of it, and my curveball was just on point from the very start of the game.  Blackmon's leadoff homer extended his franchise record for such homers to 26. His 22nd home run overall soared an estimated 451 feet, banging off the facade of the third deck in right field. Story hit a game-tying single in the second after Blash's homer, and the Rockies chased Perdomo by scoring five times in the third. Story hit a two-run double and Marquez hit a run-scoring infield single after the Rockies scored on bases-loaded walks to Mark Reynolds and LeMahieu. Story has recorded multi-RBI games for the first time this season and has five hits in his past 12 at-bats to raise his average to .230, the highest it has been since June 20.  I see certain counts where the swing is shortening,  Rockies manager Bud Black said.  He's taking a better approach to the overall at-bat.  The Rockies improved to 9-6 in starts by Marquez. The 22-year-old rookie has pitched into the seventh in consecutive starts for the first time in his career, and his fastball was still clocked at 96 mph in the seventh.  His ability to land some breaking balls as the game went on (was good),  Black said.  He mixed in some changeups, too. But to have three pitches and keep those guys on guard for any of them at any time is good stuff.  He's growing as a pitcher in regards to the ability to throw a 1-0 curveball and a 2-1 curveball. Those are things that good pitchers do.  NOTES: Rockies RHP Jairo Diaz was recalled from Triple-A Albuquerque, and LHP Zac Rosscup was optioned there. ... Rockies RHP Chad Bettis (testicular cancer) is scheduled to make his second rehab start for Double-A Hartford on Tuesday and throw three innings or about 45 pitches. ...

Investors, hearing President Xi Jinping signal for a crackdown on financial risk, are speeding their flight from expensive technology stocks and small caps into traditional economy blue chips. The overheated early-stage startup space might be next.     Mainland investors read Xi's weekend comments, delivered at a five yearly financial forum, as a sign conditions will tighten further. That poured cold water on Chinese small caps, and on the tech-heavy ChiNext growth board. Some 500 companies hit their 10 percent limit down on Monday. The ChiNext index lost over 5 percent, its worst day in years, and is down around 20 percent year to date, compared to a 10 percent rise in the benchmark CSI300.   Graphic: China's tech-heavy ChiNext growth board has plummeted while blue chips rally: reut.rs/2u4ioxO      The correction may mark the end of a broader trend that started in 2015, when Premier Li Keqiang publicly praised young entrepreneurs and said he would  stoke the fires of innovation . Bureaucrats poured money into incubators and subsidized college student startups. Policy initiatives focused on upgrading the old economy helped pushed up valuations for tech companies - far above global peers. And subsidies flooded the country with more than its fair share of 20-something CEOs running online stores, bicycle sharing services, or doing something with drones.         But pragmatic Xi has now seized the economic reins from his idealistic premier, and he's more focused on financial risk than reinventing the economy. Many entrepreneurial rock stars have fallen on hard times. Jia Yueting, for example, founder of tech empire LeEco, has become a poster child for hubris – and his flagship listed unit is one of the largest tickers on ChiNext.  For all the talk of transformation, in 2017 it was mostly traditional sectors, including export manufacturing, real estate, and old-fashioned infrastructure investment, that kept China's economic growth on track. Government rhetoric about innovation and entrepreneurship is cooling too.  Taking the heat out of an overheated market is unlikely to depress genuine creativity - in fact, less cash might attract fewer copycats – and may make valuations more reasonable for investors. But for many wannabe CEO college kids, it might be time to write a real resume. BreakingviewsReuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

Shares in the construction and support services company jumped 10 percent by 0810 GMT, a second day of gains after news on Monday that a consortium including Carillion had won a 1.4 billion pound contract to help build Britain's High Speed 2 railway. The contracts wins follow a torrid week for Carillion which lost two-third of its value after parting ways with chief executive Richard Howson and booking an 845 million pound writedown on problematic construction contracts. Rail and property services are areas where Carillion has said it wants to focus as it seeks to stabilise its business and rebuild its balance sheet. The shares are now up 50 percent from last week's lows. Analysts believe Carillion might have to raise at least 500 million pounds via a share sale or that a debt-for-equity swap could be on the cards to shore up the balance sheet. Carillion said on Tuesday it would deliver facilities management services, including catering, to about 233 military establishments under the new contracts. Its joint venture partner is U.S. catering company Aramark. The two contracts, awarded by the Defence Infrastructure Organisation (DIO), are worth 158 million pounds over the initial five-year contract period, Carillion said, adding that there were opportunities to double that figure through catering and retail sales. The DIO is part of Britain's defence ministry.  The DIO is a key support services customer with whom we have built a long-term successful partnership. We are committed to building on... our position as a leading supplier to the DIO by using our core skills and capabilities,  interim CEO Keith Cochrane said. Liberum analyst Joe Brent wrote the contracts provided evidence that the government remained generally supportive of Carillion, which is a key supplier to the government and employees about 19,000 people in the UK on its own.  We expect more positive contract news over the summer, including potentially contracts for telecoms infrastructure and government department outsourcing,  Brent wrote in a note. Carillion was demerged from the Tarmac group in 1999 and went on to buy construction firm Alfred McAlpine. The company has worked on projects ranging from London's Tate Modern gallery to the Twickenham rugby stadium.

Since late last year, regulators have made it harder for developers to sell onshore corporate bonds in a bid to help cool an overheating property market. Separately, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) stopped granting new quotas for offshore dollar bond issuance in the second quarter of this year. However, a bond underwriter told Reuters that the NDRC, the regulatory body that approves offshore corporate debt sales, in June lifted the curbs on offshore bond issuance by developers. A number of developers have already issued into the offshore market in recent weeks.  There are no written words, but the message was communicated in meetings with officials. This way, policies can be flexible,  the underwriter said, declining to be named as he was not authorised to talk to the media. Meanwhile, three developers told Reuters they can once again apply for onshore issuance with the China Securities Regulatory Commission, the agency responsible for onshore bond oversight. New regulations governing many land auctions and setting limits on home prices in some mainland cities are threatening many developers' business models, which in turn is hurting their cashflow. If liquidity continues to be tight, companies and analysts said the market might start to see bond defaults next year when many bonds reach maturity, especially in the onshore market. According to the NDRC's website, 10 property companies, including Longfor, Country Garden, CIFI and Greentown China have been given the green light since June 23. Five have already completed their bond issuance. Neither the NDRC nor the CSRC replied to a request for comment. However, one of the developers that applied to issue offshore said that the amount approved was less than what the company had sought, a sign regulators are still keeping a tight rein on financing in the property sector.  There seems to be some progress for approvals after the hiatus although further approvals still seem uncertain at this point. We think that for refinancing and more solid developers, approvals will still be forthcoming but it won't be a floodgate situation,  S&P; analyst Christopher Yip. For onshore bonds, developers such as China Vanke and Shanghai Shimao announced the sale of corporate bonds earlier this month, although both were using a 2015 quota so required fresh approval from the CSRC for the issuance. Agile also sold 3 billion yuan bonds last Wed.  The tightening seems to have relaxed a bit in May, they now resume the review process and our application is waiting to do that now,  said a state-owned developer. Developers are looking for alternative refinancing channels after the bond window at the main exchange was shut for months. Beijing Capital Land Ltd said on Friday it plans to sell a bond worth up to 2 billion yuan on the Beijing Financial Assets Exchange (CFAE), a listing where CSRC approval is not required.

Pegas shares jumped 7.6 to 1,015 crowns by 0726 GMT, after hitting an all-time peak of 1,020 crowns in early trade. R2G, a Czech family fund, is the second biggest shareholder after Wood Textiles Holding, part of the Wood & Co. investment group that owns about a quarter of Pegas shares. Analysts said the offer might not be enough.  The offered price represents 15.3 percent premium to our target price, hence we deem it attractive. However, we expect pressure from the biggest shareholder to raise the offer,  Komercni Banka's analyst Miroslav Frayer wrote in a note. A Pegas spokesman had no immediate comment on the offer. A Wood & Co. representative could not be reached for comment. Pegas runs eight production lines making nonwoven fabrics for hygiene product in the Czech Republic. It has a factory in Egypt and plans to invest in a South African plant. It has customers in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. R2G, with funds of more than 1 billion euros ($1.15 billion), was started in 2016 by businessman Oldrich Slemr after he and his business partner sold CGS Holding tyre group to Sweden's Trelleborg for 31 billion crowns.

The family has lodged an appeal with the Tokyo High Court, their lawyer said, calling the ruling  unjust . The descendents of the Idemitsu founder, Sazo Idemitsu, have been locked in a battle with the Japanese refiner's management for more than a year over the proposed Showa Shell buyout. The new share sale would dilute the family's stake and make it harder for them to oppose the deal. Idemitsu, however, has earlier said it planned to sell 48 million new shares, equivalent to 30 percent of its outstanding shares, mainly to raise funds and help repay loans. The court recognizes the management's intention to dilute the founding family's stake, according to court papers seen by Reuters. But it also recognizes the firm's need to raise funds to repay 159 billion yen ($1.42 billion) in loans - taken to buy Showa Shell shares - that will be up for redemption on Dec. 18.  Idemitsu, Japan's No.2  refiner by sales, in December 2016 completed the purchase of just under a third of Showa Shell, the first stage in its buyout of the smaller competitor. It had planned to refinance the debt with subordinated loans but lenders have refused to provide it with the terms they had previously agreed, following the founding family's firm opposition to the deal, the court paper shows.  The court cannot categorically determine the main objective of the new share issue is to enhance management's position, rather than to raise fund,  according to the paper.  The new share sale, calculations by Thomson Reuters show, would cut the founding family's stake in Idemitsu to about 26 percent, from more than a third now, eliminating its ability to veto the Showa deal. The family says the two firms' cultures will not mesh. If the deal goes through, it would be the second in Japan's bloated refining sector after JX Holdings Inc bought TonenGeneral Sekiyu.  Idemitsu shares ended down 3 percent at 2,646 yen, while Showa Shell gained 4.4 percent. The Nikkei 225 closed down 0.6 percent.

KEY RATING DRIVERS SCOR announced on 17 June that it agreed with MutRe's other shareholders to acquire 100% of the shares of MutRe. MutRe  is owned by three groups of shareholders with  33.33%  each: SCOR  Global  Life,  a  core subsidiary  of SCOR; MATMUT,  a  multi-line  mutual  insurer  operating  in France; and the French Federation of Health Mutual Insurers and other mutual companies which hold respectively 18% and  15.34%  of  MutRe's  capital. SCOR has been a 33% shareholder and a major technical and commercial partner of MutRe since MutRe was created in 1998. Through this acquisition, SCOR aims to further strengthen its Life and Health offering to the French mutual insurance industry. The transaction is subject to the authorisation of the Autorite de controle prudentiel et de resolution (ACPR) and relevant competition and regulatory authorities and, if approved, would be finalised in January 2018. MutRe is small in size compared with SCOR: its shareholders' funds amounted to EUR132 million at end-2016 compared with SCOR's EUR6.7 billion. With an return on equity (ROE) of 2.1% in 2016, MutRe is also less profitable than SCOR (ROE of 9.5%). Fitch plans to determine MutRe's strategic importance to SCOR after discussion with SCOR's management. If the acquisition is approved, it expects that MutRe's rating would be at the same level as or close to the rating of SCOR. RATING SENSITIVITIES MutRe's rating is likely to be upgraded once the acquisition has been approved by ACPR and relevant regulatory authorities.

The company, which provides online stockbroking and trading services to retail investors, also said on Tuesday it had made good progress in getting regulatory approval for a subsidiary based in the European Union as it prepares for Britain's exit from the bloc. Shares in the company, which did not say where its EU subsidiary would be located, has risen 7.6 percent to 597 pence by 0807 GMT, the second-biggest gainer on the FTSE Midcap Index . Founded in 1974 as the world's first spread-betting company, IG Group is now in the early stages of exploring further opportunities outside the EU, it said. IG reported a 3 percent rise in pretax profit for the year ended May to 213.7 million pounds ($280 million), beating company compiled consensus estimates of 211.7 million pounds, based on five analysts, in a year it called one of the least volatile in financial markets for decades. Markets were volatile last year, roiled by global politics, such as U.S. President Donald Trump's victory and Britain's decision to leave the European Union. But markets calmed down after the U.S. election in November. Full-year net trading revenue rose 8 percent to 491.1 million pounds, IG said. Its client base increased 18 percent in the year to 186,000. Revenue in Britain, its largest market, rose marginally to 223 million pounds, while in Europe, Middle East and Africa it rose 17 percent to 137.5 million pounds. Britain, due to its large client base responds more to volatility, both negatively and positively, IG said. Quiet markets around the Brexit vote and the U.S. Presidential election and a higher number of clients meant that average revenue per client was down by 7 percent to 3,446 pounds, it said.

Sunac announced a deal last week to buy tourism projects and hotels in the country from Dalian Wanda in a $9.3 billion deal, one of China's largest property deals. A large part of the deal would be funded by new debt. The share price drop came after Chinese regulators told banks to stop providing funds for several of Dalian Wanda's overseas deals as Beijing looks to curb the group's offshore buying spree, sources told Reuters on Monday. The shares had gained some ground by mid-afternoon trading and closed down 7.3 percent to HK$15.94, in line for their biggest one-day percentage decline since January. Sunac's bonds due 2019 fell 6 points to around 99 cents on the dollar. A report by Chinese publication Jiemian.com, citing unnamed sources, said earlier on Tuesday that some banks were reviewing risks associated with extending credit to Sunac, and halting some loans extended to the developer. Responding to the report, Sunac Chairman Sun Hongbin told Tencent Finance News the company confirmed banks have started reviewing the company after its deal with Wanda. Another publication, China Business Journal, reported Sun said Sunac was in communication with the company's lenders.  This is very normal; many of the banks have business with us and Wanda, they have to pay attention,  Sun was cited as saying. Sunac did not give an immediate comment on Sun's statements when contacted by Reuters. Sun was elected on Monday to the board of directors of Leshi Internet Information & Technology Corp Beijing, the listed unit of embattled LeEco, into which Sunac has invested $2.2 billion.

Demand for loans continued to rise in the second quarter and access to credit became easier in most categories, driven in part by increased competition among banks and access to even cheaper wholesale and retail funding, the ECB said.   While most factors contributed to a net easing of credit standards on loans to enterprises in the second quarter of 2017, competitive pressure remained the main contributing factor,  the ECB said.   For loans to households for house purchase and for consumer credit and other lending to households, competitive pressure and risk perceptions had an easing impact on credit standards,  it added. Among the euro zone's biggest countries, access to corporate credit eased the most in Italy and Germany while in the case of mortgages, notably easier conditions were recorded in the Netherlands and Italy, the ECB added.      Keeping borrowing costs ultra low with massive asset buys and negative policy rates, the ECB has managed to push lending growth to its best level since before the bloc's debt crisis, firming hopes that Europe is finally moving past a nearly decade-long economic slump. Still, household and corporate lending are both expanding at less than half of the pre-crisis rate as banks, held back by nearly a 1 trillion euros worth of soured debt, are reluctant to lend and instead sit on a massive cash pile.  The survey is based on responses from 142 banks collected between June 12 and 27.

The fertiliser maker reported net income of 699 million Norwegian crowns ($86 million), down from 3 billion a year earlier and well short of the 1.21 billion forecast by analysts polled by Reuters. Yara shares were down 4.3 percent at 0803 GMT, lagging an Oslo benchmark index down 0.49 percent. It was the third-worst performing stock on Europe's STOXX 600.  First reaction is negative; a big miss in EBITDA,  said Patrick Lambert, an analyst at Raymond James.  Our industry is facing strong oversupply of urea and other commodity nitrogen products,  CEO Svein Tore Holsether said, noting this was hitting margins. High gas prices in the energy-intensive business were also hurting, with Yara's average global gas costs up 24 percent on a year earlier. The company said this would spur it to expand in premium fertilisers and industrial applications, where it said margins are more stable.  After the very weak Q2 report, we are likely to lower our estimates for 2017, but long-term should be less affected,  said Tomas Skeivys, an analyst at Norne Securities, who holds a  Sell  rating on the stock. Yara said its cost-cutting remained on track and would deliver at least $500 million in annual earnings improvement -- or 10 crowns net income per share -- of which an estimated $150 million would be realised in 2017.

Fitch Ratings has affirmed the ratings of Jih Sun Financial Holding Co., Ltd (JSH) and its subsidiaries, Jih Sun Securities Co.,Ltd (JSS) and Jih Sun International Bank (JSIB). The Outlook on all three entities is Stable. A full list of rating action is at the end of this commentary. KEY RATING DRIVERS IDRS, NATIONAL RATINGS AND VIABILITY RATING The Issuer Default Ratings (IDR), National Ratings and Viability Rating reflect a holistic assessment of JSH's credit profile and that of its two fully owned subsidiaries. We do not believe the profiles of the three entities can be meaningfully disentangled due to high integration, consolidated supervision and limited restriction of capital and liquidity fungibility within the group. The affirmation reflects the group's stable credit profile, largely underpinned by its sustained modest core profitability, moderate risk taking and low use of leverage. Fitch believes the group's credit strength will remain constrained by its weak franchise. The group does not have pricing power in either the securities or commercial banking business and lacks a competitive niche. This makes it vulnerable to fluctuations in the operating environment and capital markets, leading to variable performance over economic cycles. JSH's return on assets has ranged from 0.5%-1% during 2012-2016. The Stable Outlook reflects our expectation that the group will continue to expand selectively with adequate underwriting prudence. Its balance sheet has only grown modestly at about 3.6% per year over 2012-2016. Thus, the group is likely to maintain strong capitalisation with manageable asset quality. Fitch believes the group's intention to increase its small-to-medium enterprise exposure and its proprietary trading position will not alter our assessment of the group's risk appetite, which we consider as modest relative to peers. For example, JSIB's loan composition is not overly aggressive, with about 70% of its loan book being secured. About half of the loan portfolio consisted of mortgages, which are mostly owner-occupied and have a loan/value ratio of about 40%. Furthermore, stockholdings accounted for about 3% of total group assets, with a large part of its investment portfolio being government bonds and investment-grade private-sector bonds. The 'A-(twn)' National Ratings of the three entities correspond to their IDRs and reflect moderate default risk relative to domestic issuers in Taiwan. JSIB's Support Rating of '5' and Support Rating Floor of 'No Floor' reflect our belief that there is low likelihood of sovereign support due to its small deposit franchise and limited systemic importance. SUBORDINATED DEBT JSIB's non-Basel III-compliant subordinated bond is rated one notch below its National Long-Term Rating to reflect its subordinated status and the absence of going-concern loss-absorption features. JSIB's Taiwanese Basel III Tier 2 (BIIIT2) capital is rated two notches below its anchor rating - the National Long-Term Rating. This comprises of zero notching for non-performance risk and two notches for loss severity. Wider notching than Fitch's base case of one notch reflects the poor recovery prospects for Taiwanese BIIIT2 debt at the point of non-viability or government receivership. Taiwan's authorities would only move a bank into insolvency administration when it reaches a very low capital level or a 2% capital adequacy ratio, reducing the recovery prospects for BIIIT2 debt. The above notching practices are in accordance with Fitch's criteria on rating bank regulatory capital and similar securities. RATING SENSITIVITIES IDRS, NATIONAL RATINGS AND VIABILITY RATING The group's IDRs and National Ratings are Viability Rating-driven and have a Stable Outlook. The ratings have already captured its weakened securities franchise, as brokerage market share has dropped to 3.2% in 2016, from 4.1% in 2010. Rating downgrade pressure is limited unless the group incurs unexpected large trading losses or loan impairments that significantly weaken its capital profile. An upgrade is likely if the group can improve its franchise meaningfully, bringing up its profitability to sector average while maintaining stable risk appetite. SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR The Support Rating and Support Rating Floor are sensitive to any change in assumptions around the propensity or ability of Taiwan's government to provide timely support to JSIB. SUBORDINATED DEBT Any rating action on JSIB's National Long-Term Rating could trigger a similar move on its debt ratings.

Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch’s factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch’s ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.

A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security.

Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction.

Fitch Ratings has placed the ratings of Taiwan-based KGI Bank (BBB/Stable) on Rating Watch Negative (RWN); including its Long- and Short-Term Issuer Default Ratings (IDR), National Long- and Short-Term Ratings and Viability Rating. At the same time, we have placed the bank's Support Rating and Support Rating Floor on Rating Watch Evolving (RWE). A full list of rating action is at the end of this commentary. This follows a 7 July 2017 announcement that KGI Bank's sole parent, China Development Financial Holding Corp, plans to acquire a 25.33% stake in Taipei-based China Life Insurance Co., Ltd. (China Life (Taiwan)) in a cash tender offer. The transaction is pending regulatory approval and is planned for completion in 3Q17. China Development Financial currently has three main fully owned subsidiaries; KGI Bank, KGI Securities and CDIB Capital Group. The transaction is in line with Fitch's expectation of the group pursuing inorganic expansion, considering the abundant capital release from the divestment of CDIB Capital's direct investment portfolio to increase capital efficiency. The transaction, which amounts to TWD30.8 billion, will be financed by a capital reduction of TWD20 billion from CDIB Capital, a capital reduction of TWD5 billion from KGI Securities and the rest through the issuance of subordinate debt. We believe the capital reductions will not significantly undermine capitalisation at the two companies. CDIB Capital's direct investments would remain fully equity-funded and KGI Securities has adequate capitalisation relative to its moderate risk-taking, further backed by its strong and profitable brokerage franchise. If the tender offer is successful, China Development Financial will own 34.96% of China Life (Taiwan), as it already holds 9.63% through KGI Securities. According to Taiwan's Financial Holding Company Act, a stake of 25% or more will allow China Development Financial to consolidate China Life (Taiwan) as a subsidiary. This would result in China Life (Taiwan) accounting for a majority of group assets. Based on Fitch's calculations, KGI Bank, KGI Securities and CDIB Capital each represented about 62%, 30% and 8% of total assets, respectively, at end-2016. KEY RATING DRIVERS IDRS, NATIONAL RATINGS AND VIABILITY RATING The RWN reflects Fitch's view that KGI Bank's ratings would be influenced by the addition of China Life (Taiwan) to China Development Financial and the transaction's incremental risks and benefits to the group as a whole. KGI Bank's ratings reflect a holistic assessment of China Development Financial's credit profile due to the high integration between group subsidiaries, consolidated supervision and limited restriction on capital and liquidity fungibility within the group. We expect China Development Financial would benefit gradually from increased business and revenue diversification, a larger retail customer base and enhanced product platform. This is, however, counterbalanced by a rise in the group's use of leverage, with equity/assets decreasing from 18.7% at end-2016 to a Fitch-estimated 10.0% on a pro forma basis. That being said, use of leverage would remain moderate against peers with a similar business mix in commercial banking and insurance. In 2016, KGI Bank's profitability weakened due to a lower interest margin, lacklustre fee income generation and higher credit costs. Its return on assets was down to 0.7% in 2016, from 1.0% in 2015, though still above the 0.6% sector average. The bank's loan book expanded at 15.8% in 2016 and 5.6% in 1Q17, reflecting rapid growth that could undermine its asset quality and capitalisation if it continues over the medium term. SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR KGI Bank's Support Rating and Support Rating Floor are placed on RWE as we believe the likelihood of sovereign support could increase if China Development Financial becomes more systemically important, despite KGI Bank's small deposit franchise and limited systemic importance. RATING SENSITIVITIES IDRS, NATIONAL RATINGS AND VIABILITY RATING Fitch expects to resolve the RWN once the transaction is completed. The ratings will be sensitive to the group's overall risk appetite and strategic focus post the transaction; in particular, to its overseas strategy, China exposure, investment quality and ability to maintain a healthy capital profile. KGI Bank's rating is most likely to be maintained if we deem that China Life (Taiwan) will not drag down the group's overall credit profile. On the other hand, we will downgrade KGI Bank's ratings by one notch if we assess that China Life (Taiwan) is of a significantly weaker profile than the group. In the medium term, we believe that China Development Financial's credit profile will depend on whether it continues to increase its stake in China Life (Taiwan) and the relative growth and importance of its other subsidiaries, in particular, KGI Bank. Regardless, we expect execution risk to increase, as China Development Financial recently acquired KGI Securities and Cosmos Bank (now KGI Bank) and integration and system enhancement is still under progress. SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR Fitch expects to resolve the RWE once the transaction is completed. The Support Rating and Support Rating Floor are sensitive to any change in assumptions around the propensity or ability of Taiwan to provide timely support to KGI Bank.

The girls are hoping to receive the documentation there that they need to travel to the United States. The reversal reportedly came at the request of U.S. President Donald Trump, who has been embroiled in controversy over his efforts to restrict immigration from several Muslim-majority countries. Afghanistan itself is not on the list, and Team Afghanistan's robot had already been allowed entry to the United States.  We are so happy from the support of the Americans and Mr. Trump, and we thank them for providing us visas to allow us to travel and attend the competitions,  Qaderyan said.

Trump's daughter, Ivanka Trump, wrote in a statement on Facebook.  These girls represent our world's future scientists, engineers, and innovators!  While officials did not comment on the reasons for initially denying the girls visas, the United States often denies visa requests from Afghans over fears that they will refuse to return home. Members of the team said they see the competition as a chance to help improve conditions in Afghanistan, where women and girls often face significant limitations in public and private life.  Afghanistan is a war-torn country where it is difficult for women to improve,  said 15-year-old Lida Azizi.  But now this is a big chance for us to attend in the competitions and also it’s good for our country.

The Saudi index edged down 0.1 percent in the first half-hour as Saudi Kayan, the most heavily traded stock, rose 2.2 percent. Its second-quarter net profit climbed to 242 million riyals ($64.5 million) from 97.3 million riyals a year ago; analysts had on average predicted 212 million riyals. Jouf Cement jumped 9.5 percent after shareholders approved a 10 percent capital increase via an issue of bonus shares, to be paid for with the company's retained earnings. National Co for Glass Industries surged 7.1 percent after reporting a 224 percent leap in quarterly net profit, although operating profit actually fell sharply. Qassim Cement fell 0.4 percent after it reported a quarterly profit of 53.2 million riyals versus 113.9 million riyals year ago; analysts had on average expected 66 million riyals. In Dubai, the index edged down 0.2 percent after rising for seven straight sessions through Monday. Property firm DAMAC, one of the stocks which led the rally, fell back 4.3 percent. Qatar's index slipped 0.3 percent as Masraf Al Rayan , the second-largest bank by market value, dropped 1.1 percent. It reported flat quarterly net profit, in line with analysts' forecasts, suggesting the impact of Qatar's diplomatic crisis has so far been minor. Customer deposits were 61.21 billion riyals ($16.8 billion) at the end of June, up 5.9 percent from a year earlier but down 3 percent from the previous quarter. Share prices were unchanged for Al Khalij Commercial Bank , which reported flat first-half earnings, and Ahli Bank, which reported a 3 percent rise in net profit for the first half.

The announcement overnight that two Republican senators would not support the latest version of the healthcare bill -- had led to speculation that the reform proposal is likely to be withdrawn. It fed into a belief that Trump's tax cuts and spending plasn will come to nought. The dollar index against a basket of major currencies sank to its lowest since last September with euro rising above $1.15 against the greenback for the first time since May 2016. In Asian hours, the Australian dollar surged more than 1 percent after minutes from the central bank's last policy meeting showed it turning more upbeat on the economic outlook.  The reform momentum of the Trump administration has received another blow,  said strategists at Morgan Stanley led by Hans Redeker, in a note to clients. The strategists, however, added the  Goldilocks  scenario for the United States -- loose monetary policy along with relatively healthy economic growth -- is likely to continue. Expectations for the Fed hiking interest rates this year have been pushed back to the fourth quarter, the latest Reuters poll of more than 100 economists showed. A poll conducted last month predicted the Fed to raise rates by September. Stocks struggled with European shares off more than 0.4 percent as a set of disappointing results from the likes of Ericsson and Lufthansa soured the mood. Regional stocks have rushed back into the limelight this year as foreign investors have piled in on the back of receding political risks, upbeat earnings and an economic recovery gaining traction. Bullish bets on euro zone equities were named as one of three top crowded trades in the latest Bank of America-Merrill Lynch global fund managers survey, leaving them most vulnerable to earnings disappointments or signs of central bank tightening. The MSCI All-Country World index was little changed while U.S. stock futures  were off 0.1 percent. Tempered expectations for Trump's spending plans weighed on European bond yields which edged lower, tracking U.S. equivalents, after the collapse of the second healthcare bill. U.S. 10-year bond yields fell after the news, while German 10-year yields dipped 2 basis points to 0.57 percent when European trading started on Tuesday. Yields across the globe rose sharply after Trump won the U.S. election in November on promises for tax reforms and infrastructure investment that were expected to boost growth and inflation in the world's largest economy. In commodity markets, oil prices steadied as expectations of firm demand, particularly from China, was met ample supply. Brent crude futures eased 0.1 percent to $48.35 a barrel while U.S. crude oil fell 0.2 percent to $45.93.

Demand for loans continued to rise in the second quarter and access to credit became easier in most categories, driven in part by increased competition among banks and access to even cheaper wholesale and retail funding, the ECB said.   While most factors contributed to a net easing of credit standards on loans to enterprises in the second quarter of 2017, competitive pressure remained the main contributing factor,  the ECB said.   For loans to households for house purchase and for consumer credit and other lending to households, competitive pressure and risk perceptions had an easing impact on credit standards,  it added. Among the euro zone's biggest countries, access to corporate credit eased the most in Italy and Germany while in the case of mortgages, notably easier conditions were recorded in the Netherlands and Italy, the ECB added.      Keeping borrowing costs ultra low with massive asset buys and negative policy rates, the ECB has managed to push lending growth to its best level since before the bloc's debt crisis, firming hopes that Europe is finally moving past a nearly decade-long economic slump. Still, household and corporate lending are both expanding at less than half of the pre-crisis rate as banks, held back by nearly a 1 trillion euros worth of soured debt, are reluctant to lend and instead sit on a massive cash pile.  The survey is based on responses from 142 banks collected between June 12 and 27.

Local media reported that the blaze, which started shortly after midnight, has spread across 20 km and first threatened the villages of Srinjine, Sitno Gornje and Sitno Donje. One death has been reported, although it was not clear whether the cause was a heart attack or smoke inhalation. By the evening hours the blaze had reached eastern suburbs of Split. Some parts of the city were without water or electricity. Visitors were asked to leave two shopping malls as the smoke entered ventilation systems. The fire has also reached the city's waste dumping site. Authorities prepared places for some 250 people inside a Split sports hall in case there were evacuations. Citizens were warned not to go near petrol stations threatened by fire on some roads approaching Split. Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic said that if necessary Croatia might consider asking for help from its European Union partners.

A church in one of the villages was saved when firefighters extinguished flames heading towards the building.

Some 400 firefighters struggled to bring the blaze under control in an area largely covered by pine forest and scrubland. Around 20 smaller fires were burning elsewhere in the southern Croatian region of Dalmatia. The cause of the fire around Split, the second biggest Croatian city and a popular tourist destination, was unknown.

It will be difficult to successfully run the company much longer under the current conditions,  acting Chief Executive Ake Bengtsson said in a statement, adding Haldex would struggle to show growth in 2017. Haldex said quarterly operating profit, excluding one-off items, fell to 78 million crowns ($9.44 million) from 87 million a year earlier. It warned that its operating margin would fall slightly this year partly due to lower net sales. Second quarter sales of 1.18 billion crowns represented a fall of 2 percent adjusted for currency swings. German car parts maker Knorr-Bremse said on June 30 it would continue to pursue Haldex despite the Swedish company's management withdrawing its support for a takeover a day earlier. It had made an all-cash takeover offer of 5.53 billion crowns ($664 million) for Haldex whose board rejected it, saying competition authorities were unlikely to approve the deal. Haldex on Tuesday said the drawn-out bidding process - which has run for almost a year - was hurting it in negotiations over long-term contracts with customers.  We still have an opportunity to win a number of contracts where our creative solutions have kept us at the negotiating table, but with each month that passes the chances are shrinking and soon the window will be closed for a number of years in the future,  Bengtsson said.  An extension of the bidding process by only a few months therefore risks impairing Haldex' ability to grow over the next few years.  $1 = 8.2602 Swedish crowns Reporting by Johannes Hellstrom; editing by Niklas Pollard and Jason Neely","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/haldex-ab-results-idUSL5N1K915K"},

Further monetary policy tightening  is desirable  until there are clear signs that inflationary pressures are subsiding, the IMF said in a statement before markets opened on Tuesday. The global lender, which completed its second review of a $1.5 billion loan approved in May last year, said Sri Lanka's performance under its program has been  broadly satisfactory . The completion of the second review will enable the IMF to release a third tranche of aid of about $167.2 million, bringing total disbursements under the arrangement to the equivalent of about $501.5 million. The spot rupee was trading at 153.75/85 per dollar at 0716 GMT, compared with Monday's close of 153.70/73.  The expected IMF disbursement failed to boost the market. There was some importer (dollar) demand,  a currency dealer said asking not to be named. Analysts expect the currency to depreciate 4 percent this year. It has already fallen 2.6 percent so far in 2017. Central Bank Governor Indrajith Coomaraswamy said on Monday the rupee was still  over-valued  and that the central bank was still buying dollars to avoid any appreciation. He told Reuters that the central bank had bought dollars in the range of $750 million to $800 million from the market, out of the $1.2 billion it had planned to purchase in the 10 months from March this year. The central bank is compelled to buy dollars from the market to meet a reserves target set by the IMF under a $1.5 billion, three-year loan programme.

Formed by the merger of Just Retirement and Partnership Assurance in 2016, the company said it had achieved its original target for synergies of 40 million pounds ($52.39 million) a year earlier than expected. It now aims to make cost savings of 45 million pounds. Total sales in the first half of the year were 975 million pounds, the company said in a statement, up from 949 million pounds a year earlier, driven by a 16 percent rise in sales of retirement income products to 720 million pounds. It also took on more risk from corporate defined benefit pension schemes, with sales up 80 percent to 296 million pounds in the period.  These figures show the continuing benefits of the merger,  CEO Rodney Cook said, adding that the company will focus on writing high-quality business rather than chasing volume growth. Cook said profitability in the first six months of the year is expected to have exceeded 7 percent and, combined with more moderate volume growth, the company remained  comfortable with full year expectations . Sales of its Guaranteed Income for Life product, a re-branded annuity, were down 2 percent on the year although up 24 percent from the first-quarter. Lifetime Mortgage advances, where the company helps clients release some of the value of their home to help fund their retirement, fell 28 percent on the year to 230 million pounds. Shares in Just were up 0.5 percent in early trade.  We expect the company to continue to be selective in writing new business, maintain strong margins, offer dividend growth of 6 percent, and maintain surplus capital around or above 700 million pounds,  Numis analyst Marcus Barnard said.

The Australian dollar was by far the biggest beneficiary of another slide for the greenback, jumping 1.5 percent to more than two-year highs after minutes from the Reserve Bank's last policy meeting showed it turning more upbeat on the economy. In four weeks dominated by expectations that by doubts over the Federal Reserve's ability to raise interest rates further, and signs that other major central banks are finally turning more hawkish, the dollar is now down more than 3 percent. Since hitting a 14-year peak of 103.82 on Jan. 3, at 94.830 on Tuesday, the dollar index was down 8.8 percent.  Clearly anything that comes along at the moment just corroborates the market's negative attitude o the dollar,  said Neil Mellor, senior FX strategist with Bank of New York Mellon in London.  There's just not enough inflation at the moment. And anything like this (defeat for Trump) is liable to push it lower.  Two more Republican Senators, Jerry Moran and Mike Lee, announced their opposition late on Monday to a revised Republican healthcare bill, leaving efforts to pass the legislation in chaos.  If the bills won't pass, there will be no money for tax cuts. The implementation of his fiscal policy will be difficult,  said Bart Wakabayashi, Tokyo Branch Manager of State Street. Friday's weak reading on U.S. inflation and retail sales also fanned speculation that the Fed may not have justification for another rate hike by the end of this year, despite policymakers' projection for such a move. Money market instruments  price in less than 50 percent chance of a rate increase for the rest of the year. In contrast, central bank policymakers in the euro zone, the UK and Canada have recently signal led they could adjust their policies, with the Bank of Canada raising rates last week for the first time since 2010.  A lot of countries are catching up with the U.S. in terms of tightening in monetary policy. So it is natural that the dollar is losing its advantage,  said Yuki Ishizuki, senior currency strategist at Damian Securities. The euro rose 0.3 percent to $1.1517, hitting its highest levels since May last year. The European Central Bank is expected to keep its policy on hold at its rates review on Thursday while many investors expect it to signal a reduction of its stimulus in the following policy meeting in September. That the move overnight was more about politics than interest rates, however, was visible in dollar-yen moves. The Japanese currency, which has suffered from the hawkish shift globally, gained 0.4 percent to 112.30 yen. The Aussie was on track to make its biggest daily gain in four months, spurred by references to  neutral  interest rates.

He did not make an appearance in the Rays' 3-2 victory. Kittredge went 4-1 with a 1.90 ERA and 54 strikeouts in 52 innings for Durham. He'll work out of the bullpen.  I guess it does make it a little bit sweeter that it's taken so long, that it finally has happened,  Kittredge said before the game.  I just love the game, and playing baseball throughout my career, it was just kind of an honor to play, and even if it was in the minor leagues or whatever, I was constantly trying to get better and constantly trying to get here. But I never really took it as, 'Hey, I'm 25, I'm 26, I'm not there yet.' It's just one of those things you take it year by year, get better and eventually if I'm good enough it will happen.  The Rays acquired Kittredge from Seattle on Nov. 18, 2016, as part of a five-player trade. RF Steven Souza Jr. hit his 19th home run of the season, an ongoing career high, in a 3-2 victory against Oakland on Monday night. Souza hit a solo shot leading off the second inning. He lined RHP Daniel Gossett's 1-1 pitch to left field, above the out-of-town scoreboard at the Oakland Coliseum. He hit 17 home runs last season, which was a career high. RHP Jake Odorizzi (6-4) allowed one run on one hit over seven innings in a 3-2 victory against Oakland on Monday night. Odorizzi struck out five, walked two and gave up a home run in his 14th consecutive appearance, an ongoing franchise record.  It's just nice to get back to what I feel I'm capable of doing,  said Odorizzi, who struggled in the first half.  It was a frustrating first half, that's for sure, and that kind of helps ease those troubles when you come out and just do what I'm used to doing. Granted, the one hit, I'm not going to do that every time, let's be honest, but it was just good to execute pitches. I was on top of balls, offspeed was better, fastball location was much better and I wasn't constantly throwing balls in the top of the zone. Just a little adjustment I made really helped out. It was just nice to get back to being me again.  The biggest adjustment Odorizzi made was pitching out of the stretch for the entire game after walking leadoff hitter Matt Joyce.  I felt more comfortable,  Odorizzi said.  I don't know why, but I'm going to continue doing it. Once I walked Joyce I was in the stretch for the rest of the game because I felt better. I felt everything was just a little more crisp and I was able to get the ball down in the zone better.  RHP Jumbo Diaz was designated for assignment. He went 1-4 with a 5.70 ERA in 31 relief appearances for the Rays this season. Diaz had 28 strikeouts but also 15 walks 30 innings. 3B Evan Longoria went 2-for-4 with a solo home run, his 14th of the season, in a 3-2 victory against Oakland on Monday night. Longoria extended his hitting streak to 10 games.  I feel like I'm not up there fighting my swing,  Longoria said.  Until the last month, it's been a battle just to feel good going into the box.  C Wilson Ramos (sore left hamstring) missed his third straight game Monday night against Oakland but is making progress in his recovery and might return to the starting lineup Tuesday, Rays manager Kevin Cash said.  We're excited that he's feeling better, that's for sure,  Cash said.  Yesterday he did a pretty complete workout as far as taking swings, did some catching drills. He's getting better, he's getting better.  2B Tim Beckham was ejected by home plate umpire Lance Barrett after the top of the fourth inning. Beckham had struck out looking in the fourth, on a pitch that appeared to be high, and disputed the call as he walked back to the dugout. He continued arguing as he was taking his position in the field and was ejected for the first time of his career. INF Trevor Plouffe, who was traded by Oakland to Tampa Bay on June 17 after being designated for assignment, replaced Beckham. Plouffe made his first appearance at second base since April 24, 2012.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-rays-playerwatch-idUSMTZED7IA00TCK"},

C Austin Hedges was scratched from the lineup. He didn't play Saturday or Sunday after getting hit hard in the mask with a foul ball in the seventh inning Friday. Manager Andy Green said Hedges was  optimistic  he was going to be able to play Monday but as he increased his activity before batting practice discovered  he's still not quite right, and it's just still not worth challenging kind of the way he feels out on the field right now.  Green has described Hedges as feeling  hazy,  and when asked whether going on the seven-day concussion disabled list is a possiblity, Green said,  I don't know. We're three days in at this point in time, so we'll see how that all plays out. I don't know how that works -- if he's passing the (concussion protocol) tests, so to speak, but still can't get over the hump and play. As of right now, we don't have any anticipation of putting him on that at this moment.  C Hector Sanchez homered in his career-high third consecutive game. He followed his walk-off homer Saturday with a first-inning homer Sunday. He joins Scott Hairston in 2007 as the only players in franchise history to accomplish the feat. Sanchez joins Houston's George Springer and Washington's Bryce Harper as the only players this season to follow a walk-off homer with a first-inning homer the next day. RHP Kirby Yates was reinstated from the paternity leave list and struck out the one batter he faced in the ninth, He was placed on the list Friday. Yates was with his wife, Ashlee, for the birth of their daughter Oaklee Malia. In 31 games with the Padres, Yates is 2-1 with a 1.91 ERA and has held opponents to a .208 average -- .167 by right-handed hitters (11-for-66) and .275 by left-handed hitters (11-for-40). RHP Luis Perdomo saw his three-start winning streak end as he pitched a season-low 2 1/3 innings and allowed six hits and seven runs (five earned) with three walk and no strikeouts.

They recalled him June 26 and he allowed three runs (two earned) on four hits with two strikeouts in one inning at San Francisco and was optioned the following day. He missed the entire 2016 season after undergoing Tommy John surgery in March 2016. Diaz began the 2017 season on the 10-day disabled list before being reinstated and optioned to Albuquerque on April 29. He's 0-1 with three saves and a 2.13 ERA with two walks and 16 strikeouts in 12 2/3 innings. RHP German Marquez allowed three runs on eight hits in 6 2/3 innings with two walks and a career-high tying nine strikeouts. His other nine-strikeout game was also against the Padres on June 2 at San Diego. In his past five home games, Marquez is 4-0 with a 2.43 ERA (33 1/3 innings, nine earned runs) with six walks and 30 strikeouts. RHP Antonio Senzatela will be officially recalled Tuesday from Triple-A Albuquerque to start against the Padres. It will be his first start for the Rockies since June 22. At that point, Senzatela had thrown 88 1/3 innings in 15 starts. Because Senzatela, 22, threw just 34 2/3 innings last year at Double-A Hartford when he was twice sidelined with shoulder inflammation, the Rockies want to limit the rookie right-hander's innings this season. He made three relief appearances totaling five innings for the Rockies from June 26-July 7 and was optioned to Albuquerque where he threw 61 pitches in 3 1/3 innings Thursday, allowing four hits and one run with one walk and two strikeouts. CF Charlie Blackmon went 3-for-4 with his 22nd homer of the season and extended his hitting streak to 12 games. The homer was Blackmon's fourth leadoff homer of the season and the 26th of his career, extending his franchise record. During his 12-game hitting streak, Blackmon is batting .455 (21-for-51). RHP Chad Bettis (testicular cancer) is scheduled to make his second rehab start Tuesday for Double-A Hartford against Bowie. In his first start Thursday for Hartford, Bettis gave up one unearned run in two hitless innings with no walks and three strikeouts and threw 31 pitches, 19 strikes. If all goes well, Bettis is likely to move up to Triple-A Albuquerque for his third rehab start. Rehab assignments for pitchers can last 30 days, and Bettis is expected to take most, if not all, of that time, since he is essentially going through spring training. LHP Zac Rosscup was optioned to Triple-A Albuquerque. They acquired him June 26 from the Chicago Cubs for reliever Matt Carasiti and recalled him from Albuquerque on July 8. In two games with the Rockies, Rosscup, who pitched a hitless two-thirds of an inning for the Cubs on May 22, made two appearances for the Rockies and had a 3.00 ERA in those outings, allowing four hits and one run in three innings with no walks and four strikeouts. LHP Kyle Freeland is expected to start Sunday against the Pittsburgh Pirates. He pitched 8 1/3 hitless innings and threw a career-high 126 pitches on July 9 in the final game before the All-Star break, bringing the 24-year-old rookie's innings total to 107 1/3 innings. To limit his innings, the Rockies were planning to briefly put Freeland in the bullpen, and he did pitch three scoreless innings Saturday at New York in his first professional relief appearance after starter Tyler Chatwood (right calf strain) was injured. With Chatwood on the disabled list, Freeland will take his spot in the rotation and make his 19th start of the season Sunday in the series finale against the Pirates. OF Gerardo Parra went 2-for-4 with his eighth homer. He has homered in back-to-back games for the fourth time in his career and first time since Aug. 15-16, 2015. Since being reinstated July 7 after missing 28 games due to a right quad strain, Parra is batting .464 (13-for-28) with five multi-hit games.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-rockies-playerwatch-idUSMTZED7IA00TCE"},

The reliever has been on the disabled list since May  20. A's manager Bob Melvin said Monday that if all continues to go well for Dull, he could be activated as early as during the A's series at Toronto on July 24-27.  That's still up for a little bit of debate, but I think by the time we get home (July 28) there's a good chance we have him back.  INF/OF Chad Pinder (strained left hamstring) ran the bases for the second time in three days Monday and will begin a rehab assignment Tuesday with Triple-A Nashville. Pinder has been on the disabled list since June 24. A's manager Bob Melvin said that  if all goes well,  Pinder might be activated at the start of the A's next homestand, which begins on July 28. RHP Bobby Wahl (strained right shoulder) threw a simulated game Monday and will begin a rehab assignment Thursday at Class A Stockton. Wahl has been on the disabled list since May 24.

RHP Daniel Gossett (1-5) allowed three runs on seven hits over a career-high seven innings in his seventh career start Monday night in a 3-2 loss to Tampa Bay. He gave up two homers and has allowed 10 blasts this season. Gossett struck out three and walked one.  He had some other base runners that he had to pitch around tonight but I thought getting that deep in the game, keeping his pitch count down, I thought one of his better outings we saw,  A's manager Bob Melvin said. LF/DH Khris Davis hit his 26th home run of the season, a solo shot in the fourth inning of a 3-2 loss to Tampa Bay on Monday night. Davis has 68 home runs since the start of the 2016 season, which is the most in the major leagues. Davis launched RHP Jake Odorizzi's 2-2 pitch over the right-center field fence at the Oakland Coliseum. RHP Blake Treinen, who was acquired Sunday from the Washington Nationals, reported to the A's Monday and made his debut, pitching a scoreless eighth inning in a 3-2 loss to Tampa Bay. He walked one and hit as high as 99 mph on the radar gun.  It doesn't look like it's red-line max effort type delivery with it,  A's manager Bob Melvin said.  Looked like he had a sharp slider and threw a changeup. He's got three pitches and the ball gets on you. The ball's sinking when he throws his two-seamer and has decent ride to the four-seamer.

The pound touched $1.3102 in early trade after unsuccessfully trying to clear 1.31 in the last two sessions. It has risen 4 percent in the last month.  Dollar weakness is giving a lift to other currencies and sterling is benefiting,  said Sue Trinh, head of Asian FX strategy at RBC Capital Markets in Hong Kong. The dollar's index against a basket of six major currencies sank to a 10-month low of 94.706 on worries that U.S. President Donald Trump will fail to deliver on healthcare reforms. From its 14-year peak of 103.82 touched on Jan. 3, it has lost 8.8 percent. Carry trades have also contributed to dollar declines, driven by recent weak U.S. data at a time of relatively strong readings from emerging markets. The commodities-linked Australian dollar earlier hit a two-year high after the country's central bank turned more upbeat on the economic outlook after data showing China's economy expanded faster than expected in the second quarter. Investors were wary of pushing sterling higher before UK June inflation data. The market is expecting the headline and core inflation rates to remain steady at 2.9 and 2.6 percent, respectively.  If the estimates are correct then this would be the first time that the headline rate hasn’t increased since March, which could ease fears about the squeeze on the U.K. consumer, and may actually boost sterling,  Kathleen Brooks, research director at City Index, wrote in a daily note. A lower than expected reading would be a clearer trigger for more sterling gains, with options data suggesting it might test its September 2016 high of $1.32.

The pan-European STOXX 600 was down 0.3 percent. The basic resources sector fell more than 1 percent while banks were down 0.5 percent. Ericsson dropped 8.5 percent after cutting its forecast for the mobile infrastructure market and reporting a wider than expected loss, a further blow to the company undergoing a cost-cutting effort. Zalando weighed on the retail index after it reported slowing sales growth, with the German online retailer's co-CEO saying capacity constraints limited growth as new warehouses came on stream. German airline Lufthansa fell 3.8 percent, the worst DAX performer, despite upping its profit forecast after a bumper summer of bookings. UK peers International Consolidated Air and EasyJet were among top FTSE 100 losers. Norwegian fertilizer company Yara fell 5.7 percent after its quarterly earnings were dented by a squeeze in margins. Among boosts to the index were British spread-betting firm IG Group, leading gainers after reporting an increase in annual profit, beating analysts' estimates. Struggling UK mid-cap Carillion rose more than 8 percent after more contract wins. The stock is now up for than 50 percent from last week lows. Britain's second largest listed property developer British Land jumped 2.7 percent after announcing a 300 million pound share buyback and among the top performers on the STOXX 600. Analysts at Morgan Stanley last week predicted European share buybacks would accelerate as corporates react to a happy combination of better economic growth and solid balance sheets.

(YFHC) and its subsidiaries, including Yuanta Securities Co., Ltd. (YS) and Yuanta Commercial Bank Co., Ltd. (YCB). The Outlook for the three entities is Stable. A full list of rating action is at the end of this commentary. KEY RATING DRIVERS IDRS, NATIONAL RATINGS AND SENIOR DEBT The ratings affirmation reflects Yuanta group's strengthening franchise from several acquisitions - including Ta Chong Bank in 2016 and Tong Yang Securities Inc and New York Life Taiwan in 2014 - which have improved revenue diversity by product and geography as well as the group's funding profile. Fitch expects YFHC to slow its expansion in 2017-2018 as it focuses on consolidating recent acquisitions and organic growth opportunities that are not capital intensive. The group's earning structure has shifted, with the securities business and commercial banking operations each contributing about 50% to group profits in 2016, compared with a high reliance on securities earnings in 2014-2015. Fitch expects YFHC's earnings profile to gradually improve as it benefits from group integration. YFHC has maintained stable risk appetite and asset quality. Asset quality, on a group-consolidated basis, is comparable with the industry average, with the impaired loans ratio at 1.5% and adequate impairment coverage at end-2016. In addition, YFHC's capitalisation is stronger on a group-consolidated basis than that of its bank-centric peers based on Fitch's assessment, partly due to the more strict regulatory capital requirement for securities operations. Fitch expects the group to maintain its capital position for the next two years, supported by stable profits and a slowdown in acquisitions. The group's regulatory capital adequacy ratio indicates a sufficient capital buffer, although the ratio declined to 129% at end-2016, from 142% at end-2015, due to the acquisition of Ta Chong Bank. The Stable Outlook reflects the stability of the group companies' operating performance while the group works on consolidating its franchise. YCB's senior unsecured bonds are rated at the same level as its National Long-Term Rating, reflecting the bonds relative probability of default within Taiwan's national scale. VIABILITY RATING YFHC's Viability Rating reflects its credit profile on a consolidated basis. The Viability Rating for YCB is aligned with the group's rating. SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR YCB's Support Rating and Support Rating Floor reflect its moderate systemic importance and moderate probability of state support, if needed, based on its aggregate 3% deposit market share. RATING SENSITIVITIES IDRS, NATIONAL RATINGS AND SENIOR DEBT Negative ratings action could result from a weakened risk appetite, which could arise from overly aggressive acquisitions that significantly dilute group capitalisation or from excessive risk-taking for yield that compromises underwriting standards and risk controls. A rating upgrade is less likely in the near-term, as the group will need to demonstrate its ability to successfully integrate and synergise its subsidiaries and improve its profitability. The rating actions are as follows: Yuanta Financial Holding Co., Ltd.: Long-Term Foreign-Currency IDR affirmed at 'BBB+'; Outlook Stable Short-Term Foreign-Currency IDR affirmed at 'F2' National Long-Term Rating affirmed at 'AA-(twn)'; Outlook Stable National Short-Term Rating affirmed at 'F1+(twn)' Viability Rating affirmed at 'bbb+' Yuanta Securities Co., Ltd.: Long-Term Foreign-Currency IDR affirmed at 'BBB+'; Outlook Stable Short-Term Foreign-Currency IDR affirmed at 'F2' National Long-Term Rating affirmed at 'AA-(twn)'; Outlook Stable National Short-Term Rating affirmed at 'F1+(twn)' Yuanta Commercial Bank Co., Ltd.: Long-Term Foreign-Currency IDR affirmed at 'BBB+'; Outlook Stable Short-Term Foreign-Currency IDR affirmed at 'F2' National Long-Term Rating affirmed at 'AA-(twn)'; Outlook Stable National Short-Term Rating affirmed at 'F1+(twn)' Viability Rating affirmed at 'bbb+' Support Rating affirmed at '3' Support Rating Floor affirmed at 'BB+' Senior unsecured debt affirmed at 'AA-(twn)' Contact: Primary Analyst Rowena Chang Associate Director +886 2 8175 7602 Fitch Australia Pty Ltd, Taiwan Branch Suite 1306, 13F, 205, Tun Hua N.

Note to editors: Fitch's National ratings provide a relative measure of creditworthiness for rated entities in countries with relatively low international sovereign ratings and where there is demand for such ratings. The best risk within a country is rated 'AAA' and other credits are rated only relative to this risk. National ratings are designed for use mainly by local investors in local markets and are signified by the addition of an identifier for the country concerned, such as 'AAA(twn)'for National ratings in Taiwan.

The manner of Fitch’s factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors.

Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee.

The 10-year JGB futures edged up 0.14 point to 150.17 , while the yield on the benchmark 10-year cash JGBs dipped 0.5 basis point to 0.070 percent, its lowest since June 30. The market found support from the rise in U.S. bonds during the long weekend in Japan, following soft U.S. inflation and retail sales data on Friday. Japanese financial markets were closed on Monday for a public holiday. Earlier this month, the BOJ increased buying in JGBs and conducted a special operation to curb the rise in JGB yields, showing its strong commitment to keep the 10-year yield around zero percent. In its buying of five- to ten-year JGBs on Tuesday, the BOJ kept the size of its purchases at the increased level of 500 billion yen, compared with 450 billion yen in previous months.

The structure and size of ETFs, together with the trend-following nature of passive funds, mean the breadth of selling from this investor base when the market does turn south could quickly accelerate. To date, this hasn't happened. Although bouts of market turbulence in recent years have led to corrections of 10 percent or more on Wall Street, the selloffs all proved short-lived. Worries about the collapsing oil price in 2014, fears over China's banking system in 2015 and concern over a U.S. economic slowdown in early 2016 all pushed the S&P; 500 down at least 10 percent before the upswing to fresh highs resumed. Richard Turnill at Blackrock, the world's largest asset management firm which runs some of the world's biggest ETFs, said one of the main reasons markets survived these rocky rides was precisely the liquidity provided by ETFs. In each of these episodes ETF liquidity arguably held up better than their underlying constituents, and the vehicles themselves provided greater price discovery. Liquidity is  a good thing and reduces the risks of financial stresses,  Turnill reckons. Yet there was no shortage of liquidity sloshing around every conceivable corner of world financial markets in 2007, and that didn't prevent the financial tsunami that followed the next year. Indeed, the opaqueness of derivatives markets and off balance sheet investment vehicles played a major role in the 2008 crisis. ETFs were originally designed as investment vehicles for retail investors and households. But large institutional funds and asset managers are taking over, and the scale of money involved means these products can move markets much more easily. Blackrock pulled $140 billion into its ETFs in the first half of this year, more than the total for all of last year. Over $80 billion has poured into Vanguard ETFs, well on course to beat last year's record $97 billion. Although they have survived a few market scares in recent years and even thrived subsequently, ETFs are essentially untested. They came to prominence after the 2008 crisis and there hasn't been a market shakeout anywhere near that magnitude since. Liquidity Is a Coward A question mark remains over whether ETFs have the inventory of underlying stocks to back them up in times of crisis. In 2008 a whole slew of derivatives and over-the-counter financial products and investment vehicles were simply priced at zero when the market froze. That wasn't because they were worth nothing, but because there was no price visibility and so had to be marked down to zero. Would the same apply to ETFs in a crisis? The nature of ETFs and passive investment is worth noting. A vanilla S&P; 500 ETF, for example, effectively puts company and sector fundamentals to one side and buys or sells 500 stocks at a time. This is fine in a rising market, but potentially dangerous in a falling market. ETFs are becoming much more complex too, with some of the more exotic products use a combination of underlying securities, swaps and derivatives to boost returns. They are untested yet, and could unravel in a major selloff. The longer ETFs and passive investments mushroom in size, while implied volatility remains anchored at historically low levels, the more the risks grow. Some of the numbers are huge. U.S. stock market trading volume is now 24 percent ETFs and 76 percent single stocks, compared with 20 percent and 80 percent only three years ago, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Vanguard's share of the overall S&P; 500 market cap has doubled since 2010 to 6.8 percent today, and the share of passively managed U.S. equity fund assets has nearly doubled to 37 percent today from 19 percent in 2009, BAML estimates. These shifts bear monitoring because they suggest the amount of shares in the hands of non-passive investors is smaller than thought. This isn't a problem until it is, when the selling snowballs, there are suddenly not enough buyers and liquidity isn't as deep was assumed. And it remains unclear whether, in a major selloff, ETF liquidity will be backed up by their underlying securities. According to Mark Yusko at Morgan Creek Capital Management,  liquidity is a coward, it only exists when you don't need it . Yusko points to Investment Trusts of the 1920s, products aimed at U.S. retail investors that exploded in popularity during that decade but ultimately helped bring about the 1929 market crash. The modern day equivalent? ETFs, Yusko reckons. (Reporting by Jamie McGeever Editing by Jeremy Gaunt)","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-markets-etf-idUSL5N1K91BJ"},

The blue-chip CSI300 index rose 0.1 percent, to 3,667.18 points, while the Shanghai Composite Index added 0.3 percent to 3,187.57 points. The tech-heavy start-up board ChiNext gained 0.7 percent. On Monday, it tumbled 5.1 percent to its lowest since January 2015.  The slump in major indexes on Monday was mainly driven by sharp drops in start-up shares, as they forecast continued falls in profit growth, with heavyweight start-ups leading the profit decline,  Haitong Securities said in a report. On Monday, China reported its economy grew an annual 6.9 percent in the second quarter, defying expectations for a slight loss of momentum. The growth data helped the Shanghai SE 50 Index, dubbed China's  nifty 50 , hit a two-year high on Monday, helped by the growth data. The root cause for the divergent performances in the SE 50 and the start-up index was investors' preference for solid fundamentals in a range-bound market, Haitong Securities said. Analysts also expect MSCI's decision to include China shares into its key emerging markets index to further reinforce investors' focus on fundamentals rather than speculative factors. Global fund managers are ramping up their presence in China, aiming to be well ahead of next June's inclusion of mainland-listed stocks into MSCI's benchmark index that is expected to boost investment into the $8 trillion equity market. Sector performance was mixed. Banks lost ground, while infrastructure and the real estate sector led gains, despite data showing China's property market slowed in June as top-tier cities cooled. Investors continued to chase cyclical firms, including steelmakers and coal miners, on expectations their mid-year earnings will greatly improve as industries gain from supply-side reform.

Yields across the globe rose sharply after Trump won the U.S. election in November on promises for tax reforms and infrastructure investment that were expected to boost growth and inflation in the world's largest economy. However, for most of this year, yields have been grinding lower as investors tempered expectations both for the speed at which Trump's plans can be implemented and the pace of monetary tightening by the U.S. central bank.  It is further evidence that not much will come from (Trump's) pro-growth policy that he pledged when he came to power. The market reaction is consistent but it is fairly small suggesting a lot of this had already been priced in,  KBC strategist Piet Lammens said. The announcement on Monday that two Republican Senators would not support the latest version of the healthcare bill -- meaning it does not have enough votes to pass -- was yet another blow for Trump. U.S. 10-year bond yields and the dollar immediately fell after the news, while German 10-year yields dipped 2 basis points to 0.57 percent when European trading started on Tuesday. Most other euro zone yields were flat or 1-2 bps lower. Analysts said further falls would be kept in check by upcoming supply which tends to put upward pressure on yields as investors sell outstanding bonds to make room in their portfolios for new debt. Europe's bailout fund - the European Financial Stability Facility - mandated a group of banks on Monday for a dual-tranche bond sale, a deal expected to come to market on Tuesday. There is also widespread speculation that Greece will end a three-year exile from markets this week and sell new debt.

The Nikkei fell 0.6 percent to 19,999.91, the lowest closing level since July 7. The dollar dropped to trade at a two-week low of 111.97 yen , having lost steam after hitting a near four-month high of 114.495 a week ago.  U.S. yields seemed to have hit the ceiling and the dollar is weakening against the yen, and that's dragging down stocks,  said Toru Ibayashi, executive director of Wealth Management at UBS Securities in Tokyo. Pressure on the dollar has come from Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen's cautious stance on tightening in her congressional testimony last week as well as Friday's tame U.S. inflation data. Investors were also held back by weakening support for Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, which has fallen to below 30 percent, the lowest since he returned to power in 2012, traders said.  I'm getting more and more calls from foreign investors who want thorough explanations on why his support rate is falling so rapidly,  said Kyoya Okazawa, head of institutional clients, APAC at BNP Paribas Securities. The suspicion of scandal over favouritism for a friend's business and missteps by cabinet ministers have taken a toll on Abe, who until recently was favoured to win a third three-year term as party leader, and hence, premier when his current term expires in September 2018.  It's easy to place yen buying-stock selling trade in the short-term... Abe's most attractive policy was to weaken the yen, so if his support rate falls further, the yen will likely strengthen further and hit Japanese shares,  Okazawa said. Since coming to power in late 2012, Abe has orchestrated massive monetary and fiscal stimulus policies whose most prominent impact has been seen in a sharply weaker yen  - a boon to export-reliant Japan. Financial stocks lost ground, with the banking sector dropping 1.1 percent. Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group declined 1.4 percent and Mizuho Financial Group fell 0.9 percent. Automakers weakened, with Toyota Motor Corp falling 1.3 percent and Honda Motor Co dropping 1.2 percent. On the brighter side, Toshiba Corp jumped 19 percent to 275.8 yen after U.S. hedge fund Greenlight Capital on Friday said it had added a stake. Further helping the stock was news  Western Digital Corp had failed to gain an immediate injunction to block the $18 billion sale of Toshiba's chip unit. Greenlight Capital said that Toshiba may be worth as much as 400 yen per share once it resolves a legal dispute with Western Digital over the sale of its chip business. The broader Topix dropped 0.3 percent to 1,620.48 and the JPX-Nikkei Index 400 fell 0.4 percent to 14,413.49.

The Reserve Bank of India last month asked creditor banks to begin insolvency proceedings against 12 of the country's biggest loan defaulters, and subsequently mandated that the banks would need to make provision for up to 50 percent of the amount of soured loans. The 12 companies account for 1.78 trillion rupees ($27.7 billion) in non-performing bank loans, according to RBI data.

The U.S. dollar sank to a 10-month low against a basket of major currencies on Tuesday, hobbled by uncertainty over the pace of the Fed's policy tightening and setbacks to the passage of a U.S. healthcare bill.             With the street repricing its U.S. interest rate outlook following soft data and a dovish Yellen, and with President Donald Trump's reflationary reforms seemingly lost in the legislative Bermuda Triangle of Congress, a weaker U.S. dollar should continue to support gold,  said Jeffrey Halley, a senior market analyst at OANDA.     Republicans in the U.S. Congress were in chaos over healthcare legislation after a second attempt to pass a bill in the Senate collapsed late on Monday, with President Donald Trump calling for an outright repeal of Obamacare and others seeking a change in direction toward bipartisanship.                  Spot gold        was up 0.3 percent to $1,237.66 per ounce at 0631 GMT, after touching $1,238.76, the highest since July 3, earlier in the session.       U.S. gold futures         for August delivery rose 0.3 percent to $1,236.80 per ounce.      At this moment, gold is likely to be in the trading range of $1,200-1,250,  said Mark To, head of research at Hong Kong's Wing Fung Financial Group.     Prices of the metal are unlikely to significantly break above these levels since there are no other major drivers, including geopolitical factors, for gold as of now, he added.    Spot gold        faces a resistance at $1,239 per ounce, and may temporarily hover below this level or retrace towards a support at $1,226, according to Reuters technical analyst Wang Tao.                  Meanwhile, SPDR Gold Trust      , the world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, said its holdings fell 0.21 percent to 827.07 tonnes on Monday from 828.84 tonnes on Friday.               In other precious metals, silver        rose 0.4 percent to $16.14 per ounce, after earlier touching its highest in just over two weeks at $16.23.     Platinum        rose 0.3 percent to $923.80 per ounce. It had touched an over one-month high of $934.40 in the previous session.     Palladium        was mostly unchanged at $864.98 per ounce.

MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fluttered between positive and negative territory and last was slightly higher. But it remained well shy of its loftiest levels since April 2015, scaled in the previous session. Republican Senators Jerry Moran and Mike Lee announced their opposition on Monday to U.S. legislation to dismantle and replace the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, leaving it without enough votes to pass. U.S. S&P; stock futures edged down slightly after the news, and were last off 0.1 percent. In Europe, futures for the Eurostoxx 50 and the DAX were both down 0.4 percent, while the FTSE was 0.3 percent lower. Wall Street ended little changed on Monday in low-volume trading, as investors braced for a flood of second-quarter earnings reports later this week. Overall Asian sentiment remained underpinned by solid China data on Monday, which showed its economy expanded at a faster-than-expected 6.9 percent clip in the second quarter, setting the country on course to comfortably meet its 2017 growth target. Chinese shares on Tuesday faced profit-taking as well a sell-off in small-caps. Both both the blue chip CSI300 index and the Shanghai Composite Index were down in the morning, then turned marginally up.  At the end of this month, corporate China has to pay their tax bill, so you have people taking money off the table and liquidating,  said Gavin Parry, managing director at Parry International Trading Limited in Hong Kong. The dollar, already down in early trade, extended losses. It slipped 0.5 percent on the day to 112.14 yen, well below its nearly four-month high of 114.495 touched last week. The euro jumped 0.4 percent to $1.1522, after earlier pushing to its highest since May 2016. The Australian dollar surged 1.5 percent to two-year highs after minutes of the last meeting of the country's central bank showed policymakers turned more upbeat on the economic outlook. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, wallowed at 94.791, down 0.2 percent after plumbing its lowest levels since September 2016.  It's hard to be bullish on the dollar, both from the monetary side and from the U.S. politics side,  said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief currency strategist at Mizuho Securities. Fading support for U.S. President Donald Trump was weighing on the dollar, he said, as the U.S. administration struggled to gather enough backers in the Senate to pass the healthcare reform bill, raising doubts about how the rest of its ambitious agenda would fare.  Trump's falling popularity, although it was not spectacular from the beginning, is another hurdle for pushing for the changes, and that will be negative for the U.S. economy and the dollar,  said Yamamoto. Japan's Nikkei stock index dropped 0.6 percent to end the day a hair below the key 20,000 level, as markets resumed trading after a public holiday on Monday and caught up to the resurgent yen. Fading U.S. rate hike bets also weighed on the dollar. Fed funds futures  continue to show less than a 50 percent chance of a rate hike in December after Fed Chair Janet Yellen sounded a cautious tone last week in congressional testimony, and following downbeat U.S. inflation and retail sales data on Friday.  U.S. data is still not strong,  said Harumi Taguchi, principal economist at IHS Markit in Tokyo. The combination of that data and the political situation has pressured U.S. Treasury yields, which undermines the dollar, she said. The U.S. 10-year yield stood at 2.303 percent in Asian trading, down from its U.S. close on Monday of 2.309 percent.  We still expect the Fed to hike in December, but unless the market expects the same, I don't think interest rate differentials are going to widen,  Taguchi said. Crude oil futures edged higher, benefiting from the weaker dollar, with U.S. crude was slightly higher at $46.03 per barrel and Brent crude adding 0.1 percent to $48.46. On Monday, crude prices had skidded about 1 percent as investors held out for strong indications that an OPEC-led effort to drain a glut was proving effective. The weaker dollar lifted spot gold which rose 0.3 percent to $1,237.50 per ounce.

The Australian dollar jumped 1.3 percent to two-year highs after minutes from the central bank's last policy meeting showed it turning more upbeat on the economic outlook. The dollar's index against a basket of six major currencies sank to a 10-month low of 94.706. From its 14-year peak of 103.82 touched on Jan. 3, it has lost 8.8 percent. Weighing on the greenback, two more Republican Senators, Jerry Moran and Mike Lee, announced their opposition on late Monday to a revised Republican healthcare bill, delivering a serious blow to the legislation.  If the bills won't pass, there will be no money for tax cuts. The implementation of his fiscal policy will be difficult,  said Bart Wakabayashi, Tokyo Branch Manager of State Street. Friday's weak reading on U.S. inflation and retail sales also fanned speculation that the Fed may not have justification for another rate hike by the end of this year, despite policymakers' projection for such a move. Money market instruments  are now pricing in less than 50 percent chance of a rate increase for the rest of the year. In contrast, central bank policymakers in the euro zone, the UK and Canada have recently signalled they could adjust their policies, with the Bank of Canada raising rates last week for the first time since 2010.  A lot of countries are catching up with the U.S. in terms of tightening in monetary policy. So it is natural that the dollar is losing its advantage,  said Yukio Ishizuki, senior currency strategist at Daiwa Securities. The dollar's losses accelerated after the euro rose above a major big number of $1.15. The common currency rose 0.4 percent to $1.1528, hitting its highest levels since May last year. The European Central Bank is expected to keep its policy on hold at its rates review on Thursday while many investors expect it to signal a reduction of its stimulus in the following policy meeting in September. The dollar fell 0.4 percent to 112.30 yen, having lost steam after hitting a near four month high of 114.495 a week ago. The Australian dollar is on track to make its biggest daily gain in four months after the minutes from the Reserve Bank of Australia's policy meeting. They showed policymakers revised down the new estimate of  neutral  interest rates, or rates that are not tight or too loose to the economy, to 3.5 percent, from around 5.0 percent.  Arguably, the discussion around the neutral rate can be interpreted as laying the foundation for a tightening cycle. However with uncertainty around wages and inflation; the consumer; and, of course, the labour market and housing it would be inappropriate to over interpret this signal,  wrote Bill Evans, chief economist at Westpac in Sydney. The Aussie was also helped by surges in commodity prices such as iron ore and copper following Monday's data showing robust economic growth in China. China's economy expanded at a faster-than-expected 6.9 percent clip in the second quarter, setting the country on course to comfortably meet its 2017 growth target. The Australian currency last stood at $0.7912, up 1.5 percent on day. The New Zealand dollar slipped as much as 0.8 percent to $0.7261 after data showed consumer price inflation was flat in the second quarter, below the 0.2 percent expected by analysts in a Reuters poll, and sharply lower from the 1.0 percent posted in the first quarter. The latest data is likely to reinforce the central bank's view that it is in no rush to hike interest rates. The kiwi last stood at $0.7350, up 0.4 percent, helped by the U.S. dollar's broad decline. The Canadian dollar scaled a 14-month high of C$1.2627 on Monday before easing a tad on weak Canadian home sales data. It last stood at C$1.2640 per U.S. dollar.

At the same time, we have placed the bank's Support Rating and Support Rating Floor on Rating Watch Evolving (RWE). A full list of rating action is at the end of this commentary. This follows a 7 July 2017 announcement that KGI Bank's sole parent, China Development Financial Holding Corp, plans to acquire a 25.33% stake in Taipei-based China Life Insurance Co., Ltd. (China Life (Taiwan)) in a cash tender offer. The transaction is pending regulatory approval and is planned for completion in 3Q17. China Development Financial currently has three main fully owned subsidiaries; KGI Bank, KGI Securities and CDIB Capital Group. The transaction is in line with Fitch's expectation of the group pursuing inorganic expansion, considering the abundant capital release from the divestment of CDIB Capital's direct investment portfolio to increase capital efficiency. The transaction, which amounts to TWD30.8 billion, will be financed by a capital reduction of TWD20 billion from CDIB Capital, a capital reduction of TWD5 billion from KGI Securities and the rest through the issuance of subordinate debt. We believe the capital reductions will not significantly undermine capitalisation at the two companies. CDIB Capital's direct investments would remain fully equity-funded and KGI Securities has adequate capitalisation relative to its moderate risk-taking, further backed by its strong and profitable brokerage franchise. If the tender offer is successful, China Development Financial will own 34.96% of China Life (Taiwan), as it already holds 9.63% through KGI Securities. According to Taiwan's Financial Holding Company Act, a stake of 25% or more will allow China Development Financial to consolidate China Life (Taiwan) as a subsidiary. This would result in China Life (Taiwan) accounting for a majority of group assets. Based on Fitch's calculations, KGI Bank, KGI Securities and CDIB Capital each represented about 62%, 30% and 8% of total assets, respectively, at end-2016. KEY RATING DRIVERS IDRS, NATIONAL RATINGS AND VIABILITY RATING The RWN reflects Fitch's view that KGI Bank's ratings would be influenced by the addition of China Life (Taiwan) to China Development Financial and the transaction's incremental risks and benefits to the group as a whole. KGI Bank's ratings reflect a holistic assessment of China Development Financial's credit profile due to the high integration between group subsidiaries, consolidated supervision and limited restriction on capital and liquidity fungibility within the group. We expect China Development Financial would benefit gradually from increased business and revenue diversification, a larger retail customer base and enhanced product platform. This is, however, counterbalanced by a rise in the group's use of leverage, with equity/assets decreasing from 18.7% at end-2016 to a Fitch-estimated 10.0% on a pro forma basis. That being said, use of leverage would remain moderate against peers with a similar business mix in commercial banking and insurance. In 2016, KGI Bank's profitability weakened due to a lower interest margin, lacklustre fee income generation and higher credit costs. Its return on assets was down to 0.7% in 2016, from 1.0% in 2015, though still above the 0.6% sector average. The bank's loan book expanded at 15.8% in 2016 and 5.6% in 1Q17, reflecting rapid growth that could undermine its asset quality and capitalisation if it continues over the medium term. SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR KGI Bank's Support Rating and Support Rating Floor are placed on RWE as we believe the likelihood of sovereign support could increase if China Development Financial becomes more systemically important, despite KGI Bank's small deposit franchise and limited systemic importance. RATING SENSITIVITIES IDRS, NATIONAL RATINGS AND VIABILITY RATING Fitch expects to resolve the RWN once the transaction is completed. The ratings will be sensitive to the group's overall risk appetite and strategic focus post the transaction; in particular, to its overseas strategy, China exposure, investment quality and ability to maintain a healthy capital profile. KGI Bank's rating is most likely to be maintained if we deem that China Life (Taiwan) will not drag down the group's overall credit profile. On the other hand, we will downgrade KGI Bank's ratings by one notch if we assess that China Life (Taiwan) is of a significantly weaker profile than the group. In the medium term, we believe that China Development Financial's credit profile will depend on whether it continues to increase its stake in China Life (Taiwan) and the relative growth and importance of its other subsidiaries, in particular, KGI Bank. Regardless, we expect execution risk to increase, as China Development Financial recently acquired KGI Securities and Cosmos Bank (now KGI Bank) and integration and system enhancement is still under progress. SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR Fitch expects to resolve the RWE once the transaction is completed. The Support Rating and Support Rating Floor are sensitive to any change in assumptions around the propensity or ability of Taiwan to provide timely support to KGI Bank. The full list of rating actions is as follows: KGI Bank Long-Term IDR at 'BBB'; placed on RWN Short-Term IDR at 'F3'; placed on RWN National Long-Term Rating at 'A+(twn)'; placed on RWN National Short-Term Rating at 'F1(twn)'; placed on RWN Viability Rating at 'bbb'; placed on RWN Support Rating at '5'; placed on RWE Support Rating Floor at 'NF'; placed on RWE In accordance with Fitch's policies, the issuer appealed and provided additional information to Fitch that resulted in a rating action that is different than the original rating committee outcome.

Prudential's Pruco Life Insurance Company unit has acquired a 49 percent stake in PT Asuransi Jiwa Mega Indonesia, the life insurance subsidiary of Indonesia-based CT Corp, the companies said in a statement. Financial terms were not disclosed. The deal presents Newark, New Jersey-based Prudential Financial with an opportunity to tap the expanding middle class of Indonesia, the world's fourth-largest country by population. Prudential Financial, which managed more than $1 trillion in assets as of March 31, already does business in 40 countries, including Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and China, the company said.  The partnership advances our business growth strategy by expanding PFI’s international footprint into an attractive market with long-term growth potential,  Charles Lowrey, chief operating officer of Prudential's international businesses, said in a statement. CT Corp is an Indonesian holding company whose businesses include Bank Mega and other financial services institutions. It manages more than $10 billion in assets, it said.   The need for life insurance is increasing as disposable income, life expectancy and financial literacy improves in Indonesia,  said Chairul Tanjung, CT Corp's chairman and founder. Average life expectancy in Indonesia increased to 68.9 years in 2014 from 64.7 years in 1994, according to United Nations data.  Life insurance premiums in Indonesia are projected to increase at a compound annual growth rate of 13 percent between 2015 and 2020, the companies said, citing industry data. Still, the number of Indonesians who buy life insurance is small. Premiums underwritten represent 1.3 percent of the country's gross domestic product, they said. Prudential and CT Corp said they finalized the joint venture on July 3.

With inflation still well short of the bank's 2 percent target, the BOJ is nowhere near dialing back stimulus even as its U.S. and European counterparts eye an exit from ultra-loose policies. Given the bank's dwindling policy ammunition, however, many BOJ bureaucrats want to temper market expectations of additional easing and - through careful, delicate communication - lay the grounds for a smooth tapering of asset purchases. The task could be made more difficult by a reshuffle in the BOJ's decision-making policy board this month, when two skeptics of huge stimulus leave. One vacancy will be filled by a vocal proponent of huge asset purchases. The change comes at a time when the BOJ, having failed to drive up inflation for years, shifts its focus to target interest rates instead of the pace of money printing.  The impact on monetary policy may not come immediately, but the board will clearly have more advocates of big asset buying,  said Hideo Kumano, a former BOJ official who is now chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.  That could complicate the BOJ's efforts to educate markets that its primary focus has become interest rates, not the pace of asset purchases.  The addition of Goushi Kataoka, an advocate of massive money printing, could deepen a rift in the nine-member board. Kuroda and a majority in the board believe the BOJ should allow its bond purchases to fall as long as it can keep yields capped at its zero percent target. But two in the board - Deputy Governor Kikuo Iwata and board member Yutaka Harada - are opposed to any significant slowdown in the BOJ's bond purchases. Kataoka, who co-wrote a book with Harada, has stressed the key role big money printing plays in heightening inflation expectations, suggesting he would fall under the camp of Iwata and Harada.  Full-blown monetary and fiscal policies coupled with a growth strategy are crucial to break completely out of prolonged economic stagnation,  Kataoka, an economist at Mitsubishi UFJ Research and Consulting, wrote in a research note in January. In September last year, he called on the BOJ to expand stimulus at an early stage to prop up weak inflation expectations. The view runs counter to that of most BOJ policymakers, who prefer to hold off on additional easing given their dwindling policy ammunition. Kataoka declined to comment, when approached by Reuters this month on whether he maintains these views. Counter-Balance The other vacancy will be filled by Hitoshi Suzuki, a bank executive who analysts predict will take a neutral stance on monetary policy. That would leave the nine-member board with four swing voters. While most of them will likely side with Kuroda, the increasing presence of those favoring big asset buying could confuse markets if they openly voice opposition to tapering at a time the BOJ's main scenario is to gradually slow purchases.  At some point, the BOJ probably wants to abandon a pledge to keep buying bonds at the current pace. That could become difficult with the new board,  said a source familiar with the bank's thinking. The BOJ also loses a counter-balance to Kuroda's radicalism with the departure of Takehiro Sato and Takahide Kiuchi, who dissented to most of his monetary-easing steps. Sato and Kiuchi were against Kuroda's pledge in 2013 to set a two-year deadline for hitting his 2 percent inflation target and voiced doubts that heavy money printing can change the public's perception that deflation will persist. Their views were dismissed until last September, when stubbornly low inflation forced the BOJ to concede it would take a long time for inflation to hit its target and that changing people's perception on future price moves wasn't easy. Izuru Kato, a long-time BOJ watcher who is chief economist at Totan Research, said Kuroda could have avoided such an about face if he engaged more with the dissenters.  Instead of taking into account the views of the dissenters, Kuroda rejected them,  he said.  Now he's paying the price.  The BOJ is set to cut its inflation forecasts but keep monetary policy steady at a two-day rate review that ends on Thursday, which will be the final policy meeting for Sato and Kiuchi. The first policy-setting meeting for the newcomers will be held on Sept. 20-21. Having outliers in the board is important as it helps central banks justify shifting course on monetary policy when the current approach isn't working, said another source familiar with the BOJ's thinking.  In Japan's case, they could have helped lay the grounds for a future withdrawal of stimulus.  Editing by Lincoln Feast","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-japan-economy-boj-idUSKBN1A30GH"},

Lukaku lashed home a left-footed shot in the 38th minute after taking three touches to round a defender and the Salt Lake keeper, providing the first returns on a transfer fee media reports put at just under $100 million.  I'm delighted with the win for the team,  the Belgium international striker, who moved from Everton last week, told MUTV.  I'm here to score goals and to be sort of the focal point for the team but at Manchester United we play to win, and that's my mentality when I get on the pitch and everything else comes with it.  Henrikh Mkhitaryan had scored United's first goal of the match just before the half hour mark to cancel out Luis Silva's 20th minute opener for the home side. Jul 17, 2017; Sandy, UT, USA; Manchester United midfielder Henrikh Mkhitaryan (22) shoots for a goal in the first half against Real Salt Lake defender David Horst (4) at Rio Tinto Stadium.  Jeff Swinger-USA TODAY SportsUnited manager Jose Mourinho was furious after another of his forwards, Antonio Valencia, was shown a straight red card in the second half for a foul on Sebastian Saucedo and refused the referee's request to substitute the Ecuadorian winger. Slideshow (3 Images) I didn't because I don't agree with the card,  the Portuguese said.  Because Saucedo, I think is the name of the boy, he was really aggressive during all of the second-half.  Spanish midfielder Juan Mata was forced off the pitch after a Saucedo challenge and Italian defender Matteo Darmian was also injured during the match.   Mata has a (swollen) ankle but I hope it is nothing important,  Mourinho told reporters.   A few days, a week, probably. Darmian's problem is not an important one.

The S&P;/ASX 200 index fell 65.87 points, or 1.14 percent, to 5,689.6 at 0606 GMT. The benchmark dipped 0.2 percent on Monday. Rio Tinto, the world's second-largest iron ore producer, sagged 1.4 percent after it trimmed its 2017 iron ore guidance for 2017 because of bad weather and work to modernise its rail lines. The 'Big Four' banks, the quartet that account for more than 80 percent of the country's lending, ended between 1.6 percent to 1.9 percent lower.  It was led lower by a selloff in banks which took about 30 points out of the index. Rio released FY guidance which sees softer iron ore, leading the miners lower,  said Peter Spanos, Volatility Risk Manager, CMC Markets. Investors expect capital changes for banks because the government is planning to expand the powers of the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority (APRA). The benchmark index of financial stocks fell as much as 1.9 percent, to its lowest in nearly four weeks.  U.S. Futures and Far East markets have been sold off in general so that selling pressure has obviously continued,  Spanos added. Wall Street ended flat in lacklustre trade on earnings news. New Zealand's benchmark S&P;/NZX 50 index rose 7.76 points, or 0.101 percent, to 5,689.6 at 0607 GMT. Gains in materials and utilities outweighed losses, primarily from the healthcare sector, in the index. Fisher and Paykel Healthcare Corporation led decliners while CBL Corporation led gainers. New Zealand's inflation slowed more than expected in the second quarter, vindicating the central bank's determination to maintain its monetary policy stance.

Operating profit in the quarter fell marginally to 5.26 billion Swedish crowns ($637 million) compared to a year-ago 5.28 billion, beating a mean forecast of 5.00 billion seen in a Reuters poll of analysts. Swedish banks have remained profitable throughout the financial crisis, despite headwinds from ultra-low interest rates imposed by the country's central bank. Handelsbanken, one of Sweden's top mortgage banks, reported higher interest income on the back of strong household lending in the second quarter. Net interest income, which includes income from mortgages, rose 8 percent to 7.32 billion crowns from 6.81 billion a year ago to come in above the 7.22 billion seen by analysts. The bank reported a common equity tier 1 ratio, a measure of the banks capital, of 23.4 percent at the end of the second quarter, more than 3 percentage points above the regulators requirement of 20.3 percent. The bank targets a 1-3 percentage points buffer above the requirement.  Thus the bank's common equity tier 1 ratio slightly exceeded the upper limit of the target interval,  it said in the report. Net commission income rose to 2.51 billion crowns from 2.28 billion a year ago and the 2.39 billion seen by analysts. Loan losses also unexpectedly fell to 186 million crowns versus 229 million a year earlier.

Prudential's Pruco Life Insurance Company unit has acquired a 49 percent stake in PT Asuransi Jiwa Mega Indonesia, the life insurance subsidiary of Indonesia-based CT Corp, the companies said in a statement. Financial terms were not disclosed. The deal presents Newark, New Jersey-based Prudential Financial with an opportunity to tap the expanding middle class of Indonesia, the world's fourth-largest country by population. Prudential Financial, which managed more than $1 trillion in assets as of March 31, already does business in 40 countries, including Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and China, the company said.  The partnership advances our business growth strategy by expanding PFI’s international footprint into an attractive market with long-term growth potential,  Charles Lowrey, chief operating officer of Prudential's international businesses, said in a statement. CT Corp is an Indonesian holding company whose businesses include Bank Mega and other financial services institutions. It manages more than $10 billion in assets, it said.   The need for life insurance is increasing as disposable income, life expectancy and financial literacy improves in Indonesia,  said Chairul Tanjung, CT Corp's chairman and founder. Average life expectancy in Indonesia increased to 68.9 years in 2014 from 64.7 years in 1994, according to United Nations data.  Life insurance premiums in Indonesia are projected to increase at a compound annual growth rate of 13 percent between 2015 and 2020, the companies said, citing industry data. Still, the number of Indonesians who buy life insurance is small. Premiums underwritten represent 1.3 percent of the country's gross domestic product, they said. Prudential and CT Corp said they finalized the joint venture on July 3.

With inflation still well short of the bank's 2 percent target, the BOJ is nowhere near dialing back stimulus even as its U.S. and European counterparts eye an exit from ultra-loose policies. Given the bank's dwindling policy ammunition, however, many BOJ bureaucrats want to temper market expectations of additional easing and - through careful, delicate communication - lay the grounds for a smooth tapering of asset purchases. The task could be made more difficult by a reshuffle in the BOJ's decision-making policy board this month, when two skeptics of huge stimulus leave. One vacancy will be filled by a vocal proponent of huge asset purchases. The change comes at a time when the BOJ, having failed to drive up inflation for years, shifts its focus to target interest rates instead of the pace of money printing.  The impact on monetary policy may not come immediately, but the board will clearly have more advocates of big asset buying,  said Hideo Kumano, a former BOJ official who is now chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.  That could complicate the BOJ's efforts to educate markets that its primary focus has become interest rates, not the pace of asset purchases.  The addition of Goushi Kataoka, an advocate of massive money printing, could deepen a rift in the nine-member board. Kuroda and a majority in the board believe the BOJ should allow its bond purchases to fall as long as it can keep yields capped at its zero percent target. But two in the board - Deputy Governor Kikuo Iwata and board member Yutaka Harada - are opposed to any significant slowdown in the BOJ's bond purchases. Kataoka, who co-wrote a book with Harada, has stressed the key role big money printing plays in heightening inflation expectations, suggesting he would fall under the camp of Iwata and Harada.  Full-blown monetary and fiscal policies coupled with a growth strategy are crucial to break completely out of prolonged economic stagnation,  Kataoka, an economist at Mitsubishi UFJ Research and Consulting, wrote in a research note in January. In September last year, he called on the BOJ to expand stimulus at an early stage to prop up weak inflation expectations. The view runs counter to that of most BOJ policymakers, who prefer to hold off on additional easing given their dwindling policy ammunition. Kataoka declined to comment, when approached by Reuters this month on whether he maintains these views. Counter-Balance The other vacancy will be filled by Hitoshi Suzuki, a bank executive who analysts predict will take a neutral stance on monetary policy. That would leave the nine-member board with four swing voters. While most of them will likely side with Kuroda, the increasing presence of those favoring big asset buying could confuse markets if they openly voice opposition to tapering at a time the BOJ's main scenario is to gradually slow purchases.  At some point, the BOJ probably wants to abandon a pledge to keep buying bonds at the current pace. That could become difficult with the new board,  said a source familiar with the bank's thinking. The BOJ also loses a counter-balance to Kuroda's radicalism with the departure of Takehiro Sato and Takahide Kiuchi, who dissented to most of his monetary-easing steps. Sato and Kiuchi were against Kuroda's pledge in 2013 to set a two-year deadline for hitting his 2 percent inflation target and voiced doubts that heavy money printing can change the public's perception that deflation will persist. Their views were dismissed until last September, when stubbornly low inflation forced the BOJ to concede it would take a long time for inflation to hit its target and that changing people's perception on future price moves wasn't easy. Izuru Kato, a long-time BOJ watcher who is chief economist at Totan Research, said Kuroda could have avoided such an about face if he engaged more with the dissenters.  Instead of taking into account the views of the dissenters, Kuroda rejected them,  he said.  Now he's paying the price.  The BOJ is set to cut its inflation forecasts but keep monetary policy steady at a two-day rate review that ends on Thursday, which will be the final policy meeting for Sato and Kiuchi. The first policy-setting meeting for the newcomers will be held on Sept. 20-21. Having outliers in the board is important as it helps central banks justify shifting course on monetary policy when the current approach isn't working, said another source familiar with the BOJ's thinking.  In Japan's case, they could have helped lay the grounds for a future withdrawal of stimulus.  Editing by Lincoln Feast","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/japan-economy-boj-idUSL4N1K51NO"},

John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2v92ssF By John Kemp LONDON, July 17 (Reuters) - Hedge funds have continued to cover their short positions in crude and refined products, but the impact on oil prices has been surprisingly muted so far, with a much smaller rally in prices than expected. Hedge funds and other money managers reduced short positions in the five main futures and options contracts linked to petroleum prices by a combined 69 million barrels in the week to July 11. Fund managers have cut the total number of short positions over two weeks by 116 million barrels, falling from a record 510 million barrels on June 27 to just 394 million barrels on July 11 (tmsnrt.rs/2v92ssF). Over the same period, total long positions increased by just 10 million barrels, rising from 815 million barrels to 825 million barrels, according to regulatory and exchange data. Short covering was widely expected after hedge funds established record or near-record short positions in most contracts by the end of June (“Hedge funds walk into a bear trap in oil”, Reuters, July 3). The concentration of short positions and relatively small number of long positions left the market looking stretched on the downside. Crowded trades such as this have often preceded a sharp price reversal in the past. But instead of rallying, crude prices generally declined over the week between July 3 and July 11, and have only risen modestly since, indicating hedge funds found plenty of willing sellers as they closed their short positions. If oil traders became less confident about further falls in prices, there was no sign of them positioning for a rebound. Sentiment remains bearish despite the sustained draw in U.S. crude stocks, record U.S. refinery runs and repeated verbal interventions by OPEC sources. Hedge funds built large bullish positions twice earlier this year, in February and April, anticipating a tightening oil market and higher prices, only to be disappointed and incur significant losses both times. With investors’ patience wearing thin, few managers can afford to be wrong a third time, so many seem to be waiting on the sidelines until signs of market rebalancing are unambiguous.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/oil-hedge-funds-kemp-idUSL8N1K83JC"},

Venkaiah Naidu as its candidate for vice president, senior officials have said, choosing a southerner to boost its political standing in a region where it lacks a base. Naidu, a former BJP president, will face opposition nominee Gopalkrishna Gandhi, a grandson of independence hero Mahatma Gandhi, in an Aug. 5 parliamentary vote.  The position of the vice president, like that of the president, is largely ceremonial under India's constitution, in which the prime minister and his Cabinet colleagues wield executive power. However, the vice president runs the Rajya Sabha, or the upper house of parliament, where Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government lacks a majority and has faced problems getting its legislative agenda through. Modi said in a Twitter post late on Monday that Naidu, who ran the urban development ministry, would be a fitting candidate for the vice presidency. Lawmakers from the two houses of parliament take part in the Aug. 5 vote. Naidu is considered a certainty to win because of the commanding majority the BJP and its allies enjoy in the 545-member lower house, which more than makes up for its weakness in the upper house. Lawmakers voted on Monday to choose a new president, with the BJP's Ram Nath Kovind a clear favorite. Kovind and Naidu have both been associated with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, or the National Volunteer Corps, the ideological fountainhead of Hindu groups, early on in their political careers. Naidu is from southern Andhra Pradesh state and political experts said his candidature was an attempt by the Modi government to ensure adequate representation in top public offices dominated by northerners.  The BJP is also aiming to expand its political base in the south from the Hindi heartland.

Twenty-four of 27 economists said the Reserve Bank will hold rates at 7.00 percent on Thursday. Two predicted a 25-basis- point cut and one expects the repo rate to be cut by half a percent.  Economic growth in South Africa will be weaker this year after the country slipped into recession in the first quarter, and with inflation easing an interest rate cut is expected in the first quarter of next year.  While our consumer price index view indicates that the SARB has room to ease rates from as early as next week, it will first look to change its inflation rates narrative before pulling the trigger,  said Jeffrey Schultz, an economist at BNP Paribas. Schultz said at least two members of the Monetary Policy Committee could vote in favor of a 25-basis-point cut next Thursday. At its May meeting, only one of the six committee members voted for a cut.  This should send a signal that September is a `live' meeting,  he said. At 5.4 percent in May, inflation has been slowing after a drought last year and will probably average 5.4 percent this year and 5.3 percent next year. The rand is expected to end this year around 13.60 per dollar. It is currently at 12.96 with slower rate increases now expected in the United States. Wall Street's top banks brought forward expectations for when the Federal Reserve will begin reducing its $4.5 trillion bond portfolio to as early as September. They see balance sheet reduction as more of a priority than another rate rise. South Africa's economy is expected to expand 0.7 percent in 2017 and 1.2 percent the following year, after contracting 0.7 percent in the first quarter. South Africa's finance minister has laid out a 14-point program on Thursday to lift the economy out of recession. It includes the sale of non-core assets and partial privatization of state-owned companies. Editing by Larry King","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-safrica-economy-poll-idUSKBN1A30ET"},

Dubai's index rose for a seventh straight session on Monday to 3,602 points, eclipsing its April peak of 3,573 points. The next, strong resistance is at 3,737-9 points, the January and February peaks. This may mean a long period of Dubai underperformance compared with the region and other emerging markets is ending. The April peak is now immediate support for the index. Meanwhile, Saudi Kayan Petrochemical said second-quarter net profit climbed to 242 million riyals ($64.5 million) from 97.3 million riyals year ago; analysts had on average predicted 212 million riyals. However, Qassim Cement came in under expectations with a quarterly profit of 53.2 million riyals versus 113.9 million riyals year ago; analysts had on average expected 66 million riyals. Qatari banks' second-quarter earnings so far are showing only a small impact from the diplomatic crisis surrounding the country. Masraf Al Rayan, the second-largest bank by market value, reported flat net profit, in line with analysts' forecasts. Customer deposits rose to 61.21 billion riyals ($16.8 billion) by the end of June, up 5.9 percent from a year earlier but down 3 percent from the previous quarter. In Egypt, Ezz Steel may see selling after it reported a quarterly consolidated net loss after tax and minority interests of 521 million Egyptian pounds ($29.2 million) versus a loss of 137 million pounds a year ago. The company said it had suffered from a very low rate of utilisation of production capacity because of a working capital shortage after the devaluation of the Egytpian pound; it added that it expected to cover the working capital gap gradually in coming quarters.

The CSI300 index fell 0.8 percent, to 3,632.99 points at the end of the morning session, while the Shanghai Composite Index lost 0.6 percent, to 3,156.76 points. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index dropped 0.2 percent, to 26,427.27 points while the Hong Kong China Enterprises Index lost 0.5 percent, to 10,728.90 points. Sunac China Holdings shares plunged as much as 13.5 percent in early morning trade, after media reports said Chinese banks are reviewing the property group's financial risk. Wanda Hotel Development, a listed arm owned by the founder of Dalian Wanda Wang Jianlin, dropped nearly 5 percent after Reuters quoted sources as saying China has told banks to stop providing funding for several of the group's overseas deals. On mainland exchanges in the morning, 16 stocks - most of them small-caps - plunged by the 10 percent trading limit. The tech-heavy start-up board ChiNext slid 0.8 percent. On Monday, it tumbled 5.1 percent to its lowest since January 2015.  The slump in major indexes on Monday was mainly driven by sharp drops in start-up shares, as they forecast continued falls in profit growth, with heavyweight start-ups leading the profit decline,  Haitong Securities said in a report. On Monday, China reported its economy grew an annual 6.9 percent in the second quarter, defying expectations for a slight loss of momentum. The growth data helped the Shanghai SE 50 Index, dubbed China's  nifty 50 , hit a two-year high on Monday, helped by the growth data. The root cause for the divided performances in the SE 50 and the start-up index, was investors' preference for solid fundamentals in a range-bound market, Haitong Securities said. Analysts also expect MSCI's decision to include China shares into its key index to further reinforce investors' focus on fundamentals rather than other speculative factors. Global fund managers are ramping up their presence in China, aiming to be well ahead of next June's inclusion of mainland-listed stocks into MSCI's benchmark index that is set to boost investment into the economy's $8 trillion equity market. Most sectors lost ground in the morning, led by banking and healthcare stocks. Real estate sector gained 0.9 percent, despite data showing China's property market slowed in June as top-tier cities cool.

Zimmermann picked up his first victory in seven starts, and Nicholas Castellanos and Mikie Mahtook hit two-run homers as the Detroit Tigers beat the sputtering Kansas City Royals 10-2 Monday night. Zimmermann threw 79 strikes in 97 pitches. His 81 percent strike rate was the highest by a major league starter since 2008. The records go back to 1988, and he posted the best mark by a Tigers starter in that span.  I looked up in the fourth or fifth and saw how many balls I threw and couldn't hardly believe it,  said Zimmermann, who threw first-pitch strikes to 24 of 28 batters, 85.7 percent. He did not throw two consecutive pitches out of the strike zone until facing Alcides Escobar with two outs in the fourth. Staked to a 6-0 lead after three innings, Zimmermann filled up the zone. He allowed one run on seven hits over 6 2/3 innings. He walked none, hit a batter and struck out seven.  Those guys scored a ton of runs early, so I was able to pound the zone,  Zimmermann said.  They're a pretty aggressive team. Obviously, I was throwing strikes, too.  Zimmermann (6-7) claimed his first victory since June 3. He was 0-3 with three no-decisions in his previous six starts. He is 3-0 and with a 1.26 ERA in four career starts at Kauffman Stadium. The Royals (45-46) have lost six of seven. The Tigers (42-49) won their third straight. Related CoveragePreview: Tigers at RoyalsDetroit Tigers - PlayerWatchKansas City Royals - PlayerWatchVictor Martinez reached base four times with three hits and a walk. He also drove in three Detroit runs and scored twice. Zimmermann was removed after Whit Merrifield's double in the seventh scored Ramon Torres, a pinch runner for Alcides Escobar, who was hit by a pitch in the left wrist.  It hit him on the wrist, deadened it, numbed it,  Royals manager Ned Yost said.  He's OK. He'll probably play tomorrow. He's feeling much better. He's fine.  Escobar has started in a club-record 262 consecutive games, all at shortstop. While Zimmermann was sharp, Royals left-hander Jason Vargas was anything but. Vargas (12-4) was pulled after a season-low 2 2/3 innings. He allowed six runs and seven hits, and his ERA rose from 2.62 to 3.06.  I wasn't really competitive at all,  Vargas said.  I left a lot of pitches over the middle, very similar the last time out in Seattle. I just wasn't able to get out of the innings. I really didn't give us much to work with.  It's all about being able to get into a rhythm and into a rhythm in the strike zone. I just wasn't able to that apparently. Because of that, I left some pitches up and definitely I got punished for them.  Eric Hosmer homered, his 13th, on a 2-0 Warwick Saupold pitch to lead off the Kansas City eighth, cutting the deficit to 8-2. Tigers right fielder J.D. Martinez left after six innings with lower back tightness. He was replaced by Alex Presley. The Tigers wasted no time jumping out to a sizable lead and sending Vargas to the showers. Detroit scored a run in the first inning when Victor Martinez walked with the bases loaded, bringing home Castellanos. Detroit tacked on three more in second. Ian Kinsler's triple scored Alex Avila, who led off the inning with a walk. Castellanos homered on a 2-2 Vargas pitch to straightaway center with Kinsler aboard. Vargas gave up a two-run blast in the third to Mahtook that traveled an estimated 445 feet to left-center field after Victor Martinez opened the inning with a single. After Kinsler's second triple, manager Ned Yost pulled Vargas with two outs. Vargas entered the game with American League-best 1.84 ERA at home this season. Scott Alexander replaced Vargas and gave up a run in the fourth when Victor Martinez's two-out single scored Justin Upton. With Vargas out and the Royals down big early, it was Zimmermann's cue to flood the strike zone.  He's been around long enough to know when you have a lead to throw strikes,  Tigers manager Brad Ausmus said. NOTES: The Royals optioned OF Jorge Soler and RHP Miguel Almonte to Triple-A Omaha. Soler was hitless in his last 17 at-bats. RHP Neftali Feliz came off the paternity list and allowed two runs and four hits in the ninth inning. ... CF Billy Burns was recalled from Omaha and made a spectacular diving catch in the seventh to rob Justin Upton of a hit. ... Tigers RF J.D. Martinez was named the AL player of the week after hitting .455 with a 1.591 OPS. The Royals showed their respect by intentionally walking him in the first inning to load the bases. ... The Tigers improved to 40-25 when they homer. ... The Royals fell to 13-22 against AL Central opponents. ...

Kyle Seager and Danny Valencia clubbed back-to-back home runs in the 10th inning and the Seattle Mariners completed a wild 9-7 win over the Houston Astros at Minute Maid Park. Seager, who hit his 13th homer, and Valencia, who smacked his 11th, completed a four-homer night for Seattle (47-47) by taking Astros left-hander Tony Sipp (0-1) deep. That power surge made a winner of Mariners right-hander Yovani Gallardo, who benefited from three strong defensive plays by shortstop Jean Segura as Houston loaded the bases in the ninth. The last of those plays was a backhanded stop of an Alex Bregman grounder that led to a force at second that got Brian McCann with the bases full.  I knew the only chance I had was the force at second,  Segura said of his final play in the ninth.  It was just 'go get it.' It was the last out and if I don't get it or make an error, they win the game. I tried to make the play as quick as I can.  Related CoveragePreview: Mariners at AstrosSeattle Mariners - PlayerWatchHouston Astros - PlayerWatchSipp was the seventh pitcher of the night for the Astros (62-31), and the third reliever to yield a home run. The Mariners went seven relievers deep after the Astros chased Seattle starter Ariel Miranda with a four-run sixth inning. Gallardo (4-7) escaped the ninth and handed the ball and the lead to Edwin Diaz, who breezed en route to his 17th save on the season.  We had pitchers make big, big pitches tonight, (and) Gallardo getting out of that jam he was in,  Seager said.  It was a really good all-around win for us.  Momentum swung back and forth once the Mariners chased Astros starter Lance McCullers, with Houston posting a four-run, two-out rally in the sixth to erase a 5-2 deficit. Seven consecutive batters reached base including right fielder George Springer, whose bases-loaded walk off Tony Zych forced in McCann as the go-ahead run. But the Mariners responded with a pair of solo blasts, first from Nelson Cruz off right-hander Chris Devenski in the seventh inning to tie the game at 6-6. Mike Zunino added his 13th homer in the eighth, pushing the Mariners ahead with his shot to left-center off Luke Gregerson.  Clearly, we struggled with making pitches the whole night, starting with Lance,  Astros manager A.J. Hinch said.  It is tough to lose that game. We had plenty of opportunities. We kept battling, they kept battling and they win.  The Astros matched that tally in their half of the eighth, with Springer plating Norichika Aoki with a sacrifice fly after the first three batters reached base to open the inning. For a brief spell, McCullers appeared to right himself after his first-inning throwing error allowed Segura to score from second with one out. McCullers retired nine consecutive batters before the Mariners forged a rally in the fourth inning and knocked out the right-hander in the fifth. After McCullers issued the second of his two walks in the fifth, he was pulled. Seager hit his second infield single, this one a run-scoring hit, before McCullers departed after allowing five runs (four earned) on six hits and three walks over 4 2/3 innings. Over his last three starts, McCullers has allowed 14 runs (12 earned) on 21 hits in 14 1/3 innings.  I didn't do a very good job of controlling some big at-bats, especially there in the fourth,  McCullers said.  I'm not going to look too much into it. Our team is in a great spot. The offense did a great job of fighting back and getting us back into it tonight.  NOTES: Astros RHP Collin McHugh made his last rehab start with Double-A Corpus Christi on Sunday night, allowing one unearned run while tossing 69 pitches over six innings. McHugh ran his pitch count past 90 with additional work in the bullpen. He will throw a bullpen session on Tuesday and is tentatively scheduled to rejoin the bullpen this weekend in Baltimore. McHugh has missed the entire season with a posterior impingement in his elbow. ... Mariners OF Mitch Haniger did some light work in the batting cage and took soft toss but missed a second consecutive game with a jammed finger sustained on Saturday. The club is hopeful that he can return to action on Tuesday. ... Mariners RHP Sam Gaviglio will be recalled from Triple-A Tacoma and will start on Tuesday night. Gaviglio was optioned to the Rainiers on July 7 and suffered a 5-1 loss to the Fresno Grizzlies on July 13, allowing four runs on three hits and two walks over five innings.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-mariners-astros-writethru-idUSMTZED7I9QW6AK"},

Thai and Myanmar nationals were arrested in 2015 following the discovery of graves in jungle camps used by traffickers to hold migrants near the Thailand-Malaysia border. The grim discovery prompted a Thai crackdown on smuggling and trafficking networks which led to smugglers abandoning boatloads of migrants at sea. That led to a regional crisis involving Malaysia, Thailand, Myanmar, Bangladesh and Indonesia which initially refused the boats permission to land. The trial, which began in 2015, has been beset by allegations of threats against witnesses, interpreters, and police investigators. The verdict reading at a Bangkok court begins on Wednesday and is expected to last three days. Rights groups say the arrests in 2015 were just the tip of the iceberg and that regional smuggling and trafficking networks continue to operate with impunity. A lead investigator in the case fled Thailand in 2015 and sought political asylum in Australia citing threats to his life.  It hasn't been without its challenges. Throughout the trial we saw threats against witnesses, we saw interpreters and investigators under threat,  Amy Smith, an executive director of rights organization Fortify Rights, told Reuters on Tuesday.  We also documented physical assault on witnesses that were involved in the trial,  said Smith.  Although these irregularities don't invalidate the judgment, it does raise concern about the fairness of the trial.  Many of those abandoned at sea in 2015 were Rohingya Muslims escaping persecution in Myanmar's troubled Rakhine state which has seen renewed violence in recent months. The defendants include 21 Thai government officials, including a senior army general. They stand accused of trafficking Rohingya and Bangladeshi nationals. All deny the charges against them. The justice ministry initially provided protection for around a dozen witnesses in the trial. Reuters was not immediately able to contact the ministry for comment on Tuesday. Despite the crackdown, which has made smuggling more dangerous, people-smuggling across the Thai-Myanmar border has risen, Reuters reported in May. Last month the U.S. State Department left Thailand on a Tier 2 Watchlist, just above the lowest ranking of Tier 3, in its annual Trafficking in Persons (TIP) Report because it did not do enough to tackle human smuggling and trafficking.

The veteran left-hander admitted it bothered him to think about how he was knocked around as he never had been in his career. Lester bounced back to throw seven strong innings on Monday, helping the Chicago Cubs win their fourth consecutive game, a 4-1 victory over the Atlanta Braves at SunTrust Park. Lester (6-6) showed none of the issues that plagued him in his previous outing, when he was tagged for 10 runs in two-thirds of an inning against the Pittsburgh Pirates on July 9.  The long layoff let it kind of fester and think about that for a while,  he said. He threw 102 pitches on Monday and allowed one run on three hits with one walk and six strikeouts. Lester retired the last 10 batters he faced. Related CoveragePreview: Cubs at BravesChicago Cubs - PlayerWatchAtlanta Braves - PlayerWatch There have been some things the past couple of starts that haven't felt right,  Lester said.  I don't know if it was the break or what, but I was just able to get my body to repeat a little better tonight. Stuff had a little more crispness to it than the last start.  Lester also contributed on offense with a double, a walk and the first stolen base of his career. Koji Uehara worked a scoreless eighth, but the Braves rallied to scored twice in the ninth against closer Wade Davis. Atlanta had the bases loaded before Davis retired Johan Camargo on a soft fly to left to end the game and earn his 18th save.  I've probably had two or three this year where I'm like I don't know where anything is going,  Davis said.  With the outcome that the team wins, I'm not even upset. We just had to scratch and get out of it somehow.  The Braves provided plenty of theatrics in the final inning. Davis allowed three hits and two walks before facing off against Camargo, a rookie who entered the game batting .333. Davis finally retired Camargo on a 2-2 pitch that landed in the glove of left fielder Ben Zobrist.  It was like a playoff game almost with the energy in the stadium,  Atlanta manager Brian Snitker said.  I felt good with the last two guys we had up there. That's these guy's M.O. They give you a hard 27 outs. We gave ourselves a chance.  Atlanta catcher Tyler Flowers said,  It was fun, and it was almost real fun. Great job getting guys on, putting some pressure ... a lot of quality at-bats in that inning.  Chicago first baseman Anthony Rizzo went 2-for-4 and homered for the third straight game. He launched a seventh-inning line drive against reliever Ian Krol that sailed over the 400-foot sign in straightaway center field for his 23rd homer. Atlanta starter Julio Teheran (7-7) lasted six innings and allowed two runs on five hits and four walks. Teheran threw 107 pitches and retired the side in order only once. He stranded runners at third base three times and at second base another time. It was the seventh straight home loss for Teheran.  Julio really battled his way through,  Snitker said.  Those last two innings he really had to work. He never gave in, he kept pitching. He wasn't as sharp as he's been, but he gave us a chance to win. He kept the game manageable.  The loss ended Atlanta's three-game winning streak. The Braves scored the game's first run in the third inning. Ender Inciarte reached on a fielder's choice and took second when Chicago shortstop Javier Baez fired his relay throw about 20 feet wide and into the Atlanta dugout. Inciarte stole third, an outcome verified by a video review, and scored on a looping single hit by Brandon Phillips. The Cubs took a 2-1 lead in the fifth on Zobrist's two-run single. Chicago went on to load the bases with two outs, but the Braves escaped when first baseman Freddie Freeman snared Kyle Schwarber's line drive and raced to the bag for the putout. NOTES: The game started one hour and three minutes late because of a storm in the area. ... A sellout crowd of 41,256 was in attendance. It was Atlanta's eighth sellout of the season. ... The Braves activated INF/OF Sean Rodriguez (left shoulder surgery) and OF Danny Santana (bacterial infection) from the disabled list and sent INF Jace Peterson and RHP Jason Hursh to Triple-A Gwinnett. Rodriguez, who had missed the entire season after being involved in an automobile accident in January, played third base and went 0-for-3 with a walk. ... The Cubs will activate RHP John Lackey (5-9, 5.20 ERA) from the disabled list on Tuesday, and he will start against the Braves and LHP Sean Newcomb (1-4, 4.26). Lackey has being sidelined due to right plantar fasciitis.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-cubs-braves-writethru-idUSMTZED7I9QKH9U"},

The mood was clearly brighter, with the word  positive  appearing repeatedly in the five-page minutes of the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) July meeting and catapulting the local dollar to a more than two-year high of $0.7905. While traders bid the Aussie higher, economists said the RBA would be in no hurry to raise rates anytime soon as it remained watchful on risks to jobs and housing.       We would need to see an upgrade to inflation and wages forecasts to change our view of policy on hold until well into next year,  said Kristina Clifton, economist at Commonwealth Bank.  Besides, analysts suspect the recent sharp rise in the local dollar would itself add to the case against a hike. The RBA has long warned that a rising currency would hurt the economy's transition away from a decade-long mining investment boom.   Since the RBA's July meeting, the Aussie has rocketed nearly 4 percent to a level that will be highly unwelcome to policy makers in the face of weak inflation at home. Domestic financial conditions had been further tightened by a recent increase in mortgage rates at Australia's major banks, which followed a clamp-down by regulators on risky lending. The RBA's policy board also discussed estimates of the neutral level of interest rates - that which neither stimulates the economy nor retards it. This was put at around 3.5 percent, which was down from 5 percent in 2007 but still implied the current rate of 1.5 percent was  expansionary.    The discussion around neutral rates caught the market off guard,  said Michael Turner, strategist at RBC Capital Markets.  They are not necessarily laying the groundwork for a hike but this would be the first step if they were moving in that direction.   Futures market now implied a 24 percent chance of a rate rise by December, up from just 8 percent previously. It is fully pricing in an increase of 25 basis points by mid-2018.        The Positives The RBA welcomed the broad-based recovery in the world economy which had led some other central banks to upgrade their outlooks for growth and interest rates. At home, the RBA noted a run of stronger employment outcomes augured well for wages, where growth has been stuck at a record low 1.9 percent.  Household consumption growth was showing signs of a pick up with retail sales rebounding for two months. Indeed, data out on Tuesday showed new vehicle sales climbed for a fourth straight month in June to hit record highs. A new development was an upturn in fiscal spending which was now expected to be stronger in 2017/18 than previously expected, mainly thanks to public infrastructure. Still, there were a few notes of caution in the minutes.    ...The outlook for growth and inflation meant that developments in the labor and housing markets continued to warrant careful monitoring,  the RBA said.   The Board judged that holding the accommodative stance of monetary policy unchanged at this meeting would be consistent with sustainable growth in the economy and achieving the inflation target over time.

Four major U.S. lenders reported an average 33 percent drop in second-quarter mortgage banking revenue on Friday, compared with the same quarter of last year. An ongoing decline in refinancing activity, higher funding costs, tougher competition and a greater portion of business coming from third parties, who generally deliver lower margins, all contributed to the slide. Even so, executives sounded optimistic about the core operation of lending to people who want to buy homes.  I wouldn't throw in the towel on the mortgage business,  Tim Sloan, chief executive officer of Wells Fargo & Co, the biggest U.S. home lender, said on Friday. Wells's quarterly mortgage banking revenue of $1.4 billion was down 19 percent from the year-ago period. A variety of factors hurt results, including the sale of a legacy portfolio of risky loans, but Wells saw improved credit quality among borrowers, and strong demand for mortgages to purchase new homes. The bank sees  huge opportunities  in growing first and second mortgages, Sloan said. JPMorgan Chase & Co, PNC Financial Services Group Inc and Citigroup Inc also reported mortgage banking revenue declines of 33 to 41 percent last week. Bank of America Corp reports results on Tuesday. Starting in 2009, banks began to benefit from a surge in mortgage refinancing, thanks to rock-bottom interest rates and federal programs to help struggling borrowers. That activity has been trailing off as rates have started to rise and many borrowers who sought lower rates have already gotten fresh loans. It will be difficult to make up for lost refinancing volumes, even though the market for home purchases has been improving, analysts said. New and existing home sales rose in May while prices reached all-time highs, according to federal housing data and the National Association of Realtors (NAR). Weekly mortgage applications shot to a seven-year high at one point during the quarter, according to data from the Mortgage Bankers Association. NAR predicts new single-family home sales will rise 8.4 percent this year. Those improvements in the market may continue for some time, analysts said, since mortgage rates remain low by historical standards and young American millennials have only recently begun to enter the housing market. But banks' mortgage businesses will only show improvements as comparisons with a previous year become easier, they said.  While we saw some pressure in the second quarter, we think that's a low point for the year,  Marty Mosby, an analyst at Vining Sparks brokerage and asset manager, told Reuters.  We should start to see some pickup in home purchase activity.

But she has adjusted her approach since arriving last year at the 70-bed North Baldwin Infirmary in rural, southern Alabama.  Low patient admissions and high costs mean the hospital does not have doctors on site around-the-clock to administer anesthesia in the case of an unexpected emergency Cesarean.  As a result, Dr. Arthur performs the surgery if there are any signs of complication, rather than waiting and running the risk that comes with the 20 to 30 minutes it takes for an anesthesiologist to arrive in the middle of the night.   It's better for me to do a C-section when I suspect that something may happen,  she said of her new strategy. “Getting the baby out healthy and happy outweighs some of the risk.”   Physicians in rural communities across America are facing the same tough choices as Dr. Arthur. Hospitals are scaling back services, shutting their maternity wards or closing altogether, according to data from hospitals, state health departments, the federal government and rural health organizations.         Nationally, 119 rural hospitals that have shut since 2005, with 80 of those closures having occurred since 2010, according to the most recent data from the North Carolina Rural Health Research Program.   To save on insurance and staffing costs, maternity departments are often among the first to get shuttered inside financially stressed rural hospitals, according medical professionals and healthcare experts.  “It’s been a slow and steady decline,” said Michael Topchik, the National Leader for the Chartis Center for Rural Health, about maternity ward closings. “It’s very expensive care to offer, especially when it’s lower volume.”      More than 200 maternity wards closed between 2004 and 2014 because of higher costs, fewer births and staffing shortages, leaving 54 percent of rural counties across the United States without hospital-based obstetrics, data from the University of Minnesota’s Rural Health Research Center show.   The trend has escalated recently even though the national healthcare law, known as Obamacare, was designed in part to help rural hospitals thrive. But unpaid patient debt has risen among rural hospitals by 50 percent since the Affordable Care Act was passed, according to the National Rural Health Association, especially in states that decided not to expand Medicaid – the state and federal insurance program for the poor.  The outlook for these hospitals was not poised to improve had Congress approved legislation to replace Obamacare. Senate Republicans’ proposed cuts to Medicaid would have pushed about 150 more rural hospitals into the red, according to the Chartis Center for Rural Health, mainly in states that voted Republican in the last election.  But late on Monday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the Republican effort to repeal and immediately replace Obamacare will not be successful, after two of McConnell's Senate conservatives announced that they would not support the bill.  Pain Felt Beyond the Beltway  The consequences go beyond politics.  When local doctors and midwives leave town, rural women lose access to essential services. Many skip or delay prenatal care that could prevent complications, premature birth or even death. The U.S. infant mortality rate is among the highest in developing countries at 5.8 deaths per 1,000 births.  Dr. Nicole Arthur (R), visits Tariyana Wiggins, a high school teacher, shortly after the birth of Troy O’Brien Williams in the hospital room at the North Baldwin Infirmary, a 70-bed hospital in rural Bay Minette, Alabama, U.S. on June 22, 2017.Jilian Mincer   Pregnant woman in rural areas are more likely to have their deliveries induced or by Cesarean section that, while potentially life-saving, are more expensive and risky than a normal vaginal birth, according to patients, medical professionals and researchers.   Almost a year after her second son’s birth, Courtney Cross is still repaying money she borrowed because of the smaller paychecks and larger gas bills she had from driving 60 minutes each way to a specialist in Mobile, Alabama.  “There were some days I had to reschedule because of the money factor,” said Cross, a medical technician and mother of two, who some months made the trip multiple times. “I had to make money.”     Cross is not alone. The most common reasons for the hospital closures are people and money. More and more people are moving to urban areas in pursuit of work and a better paycheck. And in most states, lower revenue from insurance and U.S. government payments are pushing these hospitals into financial stress, particularly in states that did not build out their Medicaid programs as Obamacare allowed.  Slideshow (6 Images)“The majority of births in rural America are paid for by Medicaid, and Medicaid is not the most generous payer,” said Diane Calmus, government affairs and policy manager for the National Rural Health Association. “For most hospitals it is a money losing proposition.”   This is the main reason why Connie Trujillo shuttered her midwife practice this spring in Las Vegas, New Mexico. The local hospital had closed its maternity ward, and the closest hospital to deliver babies was at least 60 miles away. She sees more elective inductions because the patients live far away and can't afford to go back and forth.  “Some of them just don’t have the resources,” she said. A year after shuttering, the hospital is trying to hire additional staff to reopen the ward.   More Scheduled Deliveries  The number of induced U.S. deliveries nationally has doubled since 1990 to about 23.3 percent, but rates are significantly higher in rural areas, where it is routinely offered to women traveling long distances, especially if the weather is bad.  Induced labor and surgery come at a high cost. Commercial insurance and Medicaid paid about 50 percent more for Cesarean than vaginal births, according to a 2013 Truven Health Analytics report. The report said Medicaid payments for maternal and newborn care for a vaginal birth was $9,131 versus $13,590 for a C-section.     In largely rural West Virginia - where the Summersville Regional Medical Center became the latest hospital to stop delivering newborns earlier this year - elected inductions for first time mothers rose to 28.7 percent in 2015 from 24.1 percent in 2011, according to data provided to Reuters by the West Virginia Perinatal Partnership, a statewide effort to improve care.    Inductions allow the physicians to manage their case loads and timing of deliveries,” said Amy Tolliver, director of the Perinatal Partnership. “We know that inductions are happening in small hospitals that have difficulty with staffing.      To address staffing issues at Dr Arthur’s hospital in Alabama, the facility paid temporary doctors for a year to keep the department open when one of its two maternity doctors stopped doing deliveries.  “It’s important to have access (to obstetrics),” said hospital president Benjamin Hansert, who also organized a group of doctors from Mobile about 40 minutes away to cover some of the shifts so that staff doctors would not always be on call. “Where the mother goes for care, the rest of the family will follow.”   Editing by Caroline Humer and Edward Tobin","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-healthcare-rural-idUSL1N1JU0LN"},

The long weekend made Monday night's opener against the Twins challenging too. Eduardo Escobar's pinch-hit single snapped a tie in the eighth inning and Eddie Rosario followed with an RBI single as the Twins (47-45) held on for a 4-2 win against New York (47-44).  We were looking at options on how to get through the inning and give us the best chance to score,  Minnesota manager Paul Molitor said of Escobar.  He did a nice job. It was an off-speed pitch and he can go down and get that low pitch, especially right-handed, and he poked it out there.  Yankees manager Joe Girardi said he didn't have many bullpen options, deciding to keep rookie left-hander Caleb Smith in the game as the eighth inning unraveled. Escobar took advantage. Joe Mauer and Miguel Sano each singled to lead off the eighth against Smith (0-1), who was making his major league debut. Max Kepler couldn't get down a sacrifice bunt and ended up striking out before Escobar batted for Kennys Vargas. Escobar stroked the second pitch he saw into left field to plate Mauer. Rosario's single drove in Sano. Related CoveragePreview: Yankees at TwinsNew York Yankees - PlayerWatchMinnesota Twins - PlayerWatch Not too many options,  Girardi said.  If we took the lead, I probably would have went to Adam (Warren) for Sano. I had Adam, I had Dellin (Betances). (Tyler) Clippard, it would have been the third day in a row, had him for a little bit and (Chasen) Shreve was probably not. So, I didn't really have a lot of options. Because we didn't take the lead, I couldn't really make the change.  Rosario had two hits and drove in two runs for the Twins, who have struggled mightily against New York for years and beat the Yankees for just the seventh time in 26 meetings at Target Field. All-Star closer Brandon Kintzler finished off his 26th save in 29 chances in a heavy downpour in the ninth.  I got 2-1 and I was like, 'Good God, let's hurry up,'  Kintzler said.  Throw it down the middle and see what happens. It worked in my favor.  Taylor Rogers (5-1) allowed one hit and struck out two batters in 1 1/3 innings of relief. Minnesota's Adalberto Mejia gave up one run on five hits in 5 1/3 innings. Smith surrendered two runs on four hits and a walk in three innings. He struck out five batters in relief of starter Bryan Mitchell. Rookie Garrett Cooper had three hits for New York.  I think his slider was pretty good tonight,  Girardi said of Mejia.  We hit some balls hard with runners in scoring position, didn't have anything to show for it.  Vargas walked in the second inning and scored the first run on a double to right field by Rosario. Brian Dozier and Zack Granite led off the third with singles and Mauer walked, loading the bases for Sano. He lofted a soft liner to right field that Aaron Judge circled under and then unloaded a throw home to nab Dozier trying to score from third.  I was just turning around when the throw was coming in,  Mitchell said.  That was an unbelievable play. That was really big for us.  Kepler followed with a grounder to second and Mitchell dropped Starlin Castro's throw, allowing Granite to score.  I was there, I was on the bag,  Mitchell said.  It just went off the end of my glove. I don't know if I looked away at the last second. That's just a ball I need to catch.  Mejia struck out four of the first six batters he faced and didn't allow a hit until Cooper's infield single with one out in the third. New York had runners on first and third in the fourth, but Castro's liner was caught by a diving Kepler in right field. Austin Romine had an RBI double over Kepler's head in the fifth for the Yankees' first run, scoring Cooper after he doubled. NOTES: New York manager Joe Girardi announced 1B Greg Bird is scheduled to have ankle surgery on Tuesday. Girardi said Bird will need six weeks to recover from surgery, putting his return for this season in doubt. Bird has played in 19 games this season, hitting .100. ... Minnesota LHP Hector Santiago (upper thoracic back pain) played catch Monday and is scheduled to throw bullpen sessions on Tuesday and Friday. ... Yankees RHP Michael Pineda is scheduled for Tommy John surgery in Cincinnati on Tuesday. The surgery will be performed by Reds medical director Dr. Timothy Kremcheck. ... Twins SS Jorge Polanco was out of the lineup again with Ehire Adrianza starting. Manager Paul Molitor said he wanted to give Polanco a two-day break because he felt he was  forcing the action.  Polanco is in a 5-for-51 (.098 average) slump.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-yankees-twins-writethru-idUSMTZED7I9OKT6L"},

Hall of Fame plans. Choi, the world number two amateur, finished runner-up to compatriot Park Sung-hyun at the U.S. Women's Open in New Jersey on Sunday, coming within three shots of becoming the first amateur champion since Catherine Lacoste in 1967. In addition to missing out on the bumper $540,000 prize money due to her amateur status, Choi also had to forgo the 100 million won ($88,845) winner's check from a Korean event earlier this month. Choi, who turns 18 next month, finished 38th at the U.S. Open last year at CordeValle in California and arrived at Trump National in New Jersey with some modest targets.  My number one goal was just to make the cut and do better than last year,  Yonhap News quoted her as saying on Tuesday.  I also thought that if things went well I could finish in the top 10.  Things went really well for the teenager and had she not dunked her tee shot into the water at the par-three 16th while co-leading the tournament on Sunday, she might have been returning to South Korea with the trophy.  I knew as soon as I hit it, it was in the water,  she said of her errant tee shot, adding that she could not stop thinking about it on the flight home.  I kept thinking if only I could hit the shot over again.  While Choi will undoubtedly look back on the tournament as a missed opportunity, she could take the domestic KLPGA by storm if she maintains this kind of form, and there is no doubting the confidence she has in her own ability.  I'd like to follow Pak Se-ri and Park In-bee into the Hall of Fame,  she said of her future goals. Local media quoted her coach, Park So-young, as saying she had the potential to do big things.  If she handles the pressures of being a professional she will be a better player than any of us expect,  said Park.

Regretfully, it is now apparent that the effort to repeal and immediately replace the failure of Obamacare will not be successful,  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement. Two of McConnell's Senate conservatives announced just hours earlier that they would not support the Republican leader's latest version of legislation to repeal portions of President Barack Obama's landmark 2010 healthcare law and replace them with new, less costly healthcare provisions. With Republican Senators Mike Lee and Jerry Moran joining Senators Susan Collins and Rand Paul in opposition - and amid a solid wall of opposition from Democrats -  McConnell no longer had enough votes to pass a Republican healthcare bill in the 100-member Senate. It was the latest in a series of healthcare setbacks for Republicans, despite their control of both chambers of Congress and the White House. It also came after seven straight years of promising voters that they would repeal Obamacare if they were to control Congress and the White House, only to find that the public liked Obamacare more than their proposed substitutes, according to public opinion polls. The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office has determined that the various versions of Republican healthcare legislation would result in anywhere from 18 million to 23 million people losing their health insurance. However, Republicans argue that Obamacare is a government over-reach and costs too much money. Major Blow Monday's developments had an immediate impact on financial markets as Asian shares stepped back from more than two-year highs on Tuesday and the dollar extended losses. In the United States, the latest setback delivered a major political blow to Trump, who has failed to win any major legislative initiative in the first six months of his presidency. In response, Trump said on Twitter Congress should immediately repeal Obamacare and  start from a clean slate  on a new healthcare plan. He said Democrats would join such an effort, even though they have refused to have any part of an Obamacare repeal. McConnell, apparently backing Trump's latest approach, announced that he would try to bring legislation to repeal Obamacare to the Senate floor in coming days, but with a two-year delay in implementation to assure a smooth transition. That idea was rejected by Republicans months ago in favor of simultaneously repealing and replacing Obamacare in order to avoid chaos in insurance markets. Republican Senator John McCain, who is recovering from surgery in his home state of Arizona, urged a much different change of course - bipartisanship.  The Congress must now return to regular order, hold hearings, receive input from members of both parties  and pass a bill that  finally provides Americans with access to quality and affordable health care,  McCain said in a statement.  Start from Scratch  It was not yet clear whether Republicans would get behind the latest Trump-McConnell plans or McCain's prescription. Like McCain, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer held out the possibility of bipartisanship. In a statement, he urged Republicans to  start from scratch and work with Democrats on a bill that lowers premiums, provides long-term stability to the markets and improves our health care system.  Republicans in Congress had been hoping to settle on a healthcare bill before an upcoming August recess so they could begin work in earnest in September on a wide-ranging rewrite of the U.S. tax code. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan had no immediate comment on the next steps he would like to see following the collapse of the healthcare bill in the Senate. One health industry lobbyist said that, in the run-up to the second collapse of the Senate's healthcare bill this summer, there was growing anger among senators over proposed Medicaid cuts and an amendment by Senator Ted Cruz that would have allowed insurance companies to offer cheaper plans that did not have Obamacare's guaranteed coverage of services such as maternity care. A similar version of the Senate bill passed the House in May but passage in the Senate was always expected to be more difficult, given the deep tensions between moderates and conservatives. Moderates worry about cuts to the Medicaid health insurance program for the poor and disabled, while conservatives want those cuts as well as a more dramatic dismantling of Obamacare's framework. The first version of the Senate bill failed to attract enough support, forcing McConnell's office to revise it in a bid to make it more palatable. That version was released last week. Senator Bernie Sanders, the former Democratic presidential candidate, celebrated what he termed the  collapse  of the Republican effort.  This is a great victory for the millions of Americans who stood up and fought back against this dangerous legislation,  Sanders said in a statement.

Eleven years later, Wainwright is on the back end of a stellar career but is still tormenting the Mets by imparting those long-ago lessons. Wainwright shrugged off a trio of errors committed behind him in a two-batter span in the sixth inning Monday night to retire the final batter he faced and steady the Cardinals, who used four relievers to blank the Mets the rest of the way in a 6-3 win at Citi Field.  'Waino' (is) one of those pitchers who seems to make better pitches when he gets the heat turned up,  Cardinals manager Mike Matheny said.  You're not afraid to let him try and to work through it because he knows how to get out of those situations.  Wainwright and the Cardinals appeared on their way to an easy victory after Tommy Pham's three-run homer capped a six-run top of the sixth for a 6-1 lead. However, the Mets pulled within 6-3 during a wild six-pitch span in which Lucas Duda homered, Jose Reyes doubled and raced home on a pair of errors by right fielder Magneuris Sierra -- he first misplayed the ball and then overthrew third base -- and Travis d'Arnaud reached second when center fielder Dexter Fowler dropped a routine fly to the track. Related CoveragePreview: Cardinals at MetsSt. Louis Cardinals - PlayerWatchNew York Mets - PlayerWatch The key is to keep pitching and not let those things go crazy in your head,  Wainwright said.  That was something that (former Cardinals closer Jason) Isringhausen taught me, too, from my days in the bullpen as a rookie. Just step back, take a breath and reset and slow the game down. That's something I used here in Game 7 many years ago.  The stakes weren't as high Monday as they were on Oct. 19, 2006, when Wainwright struck out the potential winning run, Mets center fielder Carlos Beltran, on a knee-buckling curveball to close out the Cardinals' 3-1 win in Game 7 of the National League Championship Series across the street at what used to be Shea Stadium. St. Louis went on to win the World Series in five games over the Detroit Tigers. But the Cardinals (45-47) will have to rely on the steadiness Wainwright showed Monday -- when he bounced back to retire pinch hitter Wilmer Flores on a groundout before giving way to Tyler Lyons, who snared Michael Conforto's liner for the final out of the inning -- if they are to reach the playoffs for the seventh time in his career. St. Louis is 5 1/2 games behind the first-place Milwaukee Brewers in the NL Central and 7 1/2 games behind the Colorado Rockies, who hold the NL's second wild-card position.  It's not always a young or old thing -- it's the ability to be able to slow it down,  said Wainwright, who improved to 11-5 after allowing three runs (two earned) on six hits and two walks while striking out three over 5 2/3 innings. A quartet of relievers -- Lyons, Matt Bowman, Kevin Siegrist and Brett Cecil -- combined to blank the Mets on two hits over the final 3 1/3 innings. Siegrist struck out the side on 10 itches in the eighth before walking Curtis Granderson to lead off the ninth, after which Cecil came in and got the final three outs for his first save. Cecil allowed a single to Asdrubal Cabrera and fell behind Yoenis Cespedes 3-0 before Cespedes hit into a 6-4-3 double play on the next pitch.  He's the big guy on our team (that) you turn to,  Mets manager Terry Collins said of Cespedes.  Got him in a great count, and he's got to get something good to hit. And he just didn't hit it.  Rookie Paul DeJong hit a two-run homer in the sixth to give the Cardinals the lead for good. DeJong has 10 homers in 40 games -- the fastest a Cardinals rookie has reached 10 homers since Albert Pujols hit 10 homers in his first 30 games in 2001.  That's good company,  DeJong said with a grin. Two batters later, Wainwright laced an RBI double to chase Mets starter Zack Wheeler. Left-hander Josh Edgin walked Matt Carpenter before Hansel Robles gave up Pham's three-run homer.  It's my fault,  Wheeler said.  I should have made my pitches and gotten out of that. But our bullpen, I trust them in every situation. Today we couldn't get the job done when we needed to.  Wheeler allowed four runs on seven hits and four walks in 5 1/3 innings. He struck out five. Pham reached base four times in five plate appearances via two walks, a single and the home run. Yadier Molina had two hits, including an infield single leading off the sixth. Conforto homered in the fifth for the Mets (41-49), who have lost two straight. Reyes, Duda and Jay Bruce had two hits apiece.

Asian shares stepped back from more than two-year highs on Tuesday and the dollar extended losses, as two Republican senators opposed legislation to dismantle and replace the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, leaving it without enough votes to pass.     Overnight in the United States, stocks closed little changed in low volume as gains in utilities and consumer shares offset declines in healthcare, with the S&P; health sector falling 0.3 percent.      In Southeast Asia, Philippine shares were up marginally.       Financials and real estate stocks are driving the market today,  said Jeffrey Kucero, equity analyst at RCBC Securities.  However, the pressure from PLDT is keeping the market subdued.      Property developer SM Prime Holdings Inc rose as much as 1.1 percent, while consumer bank GT Capital Holdings  hit a more than one-month high.     PLDT fell as much as 2.1 percent, its lowest in nearly two months. It dropped 2.2 percent on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday.      The slide of the PLDT ADR on Wall Street last night dims the outlook for the Philippine market today,  said RCBC Securities in a note.      Singapore was little changed, with gains in financials and consumer staples offset by losses in telecommunication stocks.     DBS Group hit a more than 17-year high, while Singapore Telecommunications shed as much as 0.8 percent.     Vietnam shares were up 0.2 percent after earlier falling to their lowest in one week.      Indonesia slipped 0.3 percent, as financials and consumer staples pulled the index down.

Dee Gordon, all of 5-foot-11 and 170 pounds, hit a walk-off single in the 10th inning to lead the Miami Marlins to a 6-5 win over the Philadelphia Phillies on Monday night at Marlins Park. Gordon, who was the sixth hitter due up in the 10th, was in the clubhouse watching video of Phillies reliever Mark Leiter (1-2) when things changed quickly. With one out, Derek Dietrich tripled to right field as Ty Kelly -- normally a backup infielder -- crashed into the wall. The Phillies issued two intentional walks and got A.J. Ellis out on a fielder's choice.  It was chaotic for a second because those intentional walks happen quickly,  Gordon said.  I didn't even have my batting gloves on when I ran to the on-deck circle.  Gordon slapped the gloves on quickly and delivered a line-drive single to right for Miami's fourth walk-off of the season and its first since June 19. Related CoveragePreview: Phillies at MarlinsPhiladelphia Phillies - PlayerWatchMiami Marlins - PlayerWatchMeanwhile, Stanton has 28 homers, which puts him first in the National League and second in the majors behind New York Yankees slugger Aaron Judge, who has 30. In the seventh, Stanton nearly hit a third homer. But his high drive to deep left-center was caught by left fielder Cameron Perkins, who jumped just a bit higher than center fielder Odubel Herrera to make the grab up against the wall. After making the catch, Perkins fell on top of Herrera. Justin Bour, who has 21 homers, hit a two-run shot in the fifth to give Miami a 5-4 lead, and the Marlins (42-49) eventually snapped a three-game losing streak.  G's homers gave us a spark,  Marlins manager Don Mattingly said of Stanton.  And (Bour) gave us the lead.  Miami reliever Drew Steckenrider (1-1) earned his first big-league win, pitching a scoreless inning in the top of the 10th. Leiter, who gave up Gordon's single, took the loss and was sent to the minors after the game. The Marlins, who were swept over the weekend by the team with the best record in the majors, the Los Angeles Dodgers, found Philadelphia (30-61) a much more favorable matchup. The Phillies have the worst record in the majors. Miami got off to a good start in the first inning. Gordon's pop fly fell just behind shortstop Freddy Galvis for a single. Stanton followed with his two-run shot down the left-field line. The homer was measured at 441 feet, and the exit velocity was 115 mph. Philadelphia took a 4-2 lead in the third, forcing Miami starter Tom Koehler to throw 38 pitches in the frame. Koehler got the first two batters in the inning before walking Cesar Hernandez. Galvis followed with an opposite-field RBI double. After another walk, Maikel Franco delivered an RBI single to center, and Nick Williams hit a two-run double on a ball that one-hopped the wall in right-center. Miami grabbed a 5-4 lead in the fifth, scoring on Stanton's two-run homer that traveled 386 feet to left and Bour's solo shot that landed in the upper deck in right. That blast went 446 feet.  Everyone knows about them,  Hernandez said of Stanton and Bour.  They were in the Home Run Derby, and they were there because they hit so many shots.  Philadelphia tied the score 5-5 on Hernandez's sacrifice fly in the seventh. Brock Stassi drew a full-count walk and advanced on a hit-by-pitch and a sacrifice bunt before coming home. In the end, the Phillies came up short yet again.  Another one-run loss,  Phillies manager Pete Mackanin said.  We battled.  NOTES: Marlins 3B Martin Prado was removed after four innings (right knee). He was by replaced in the lineup by Derek Dietrich. After the game, Prado was placed on the disabled list.

The Outlook on all three entities is Stable. A full list of rating action is at the end of this commentary. KEY RATING DRIVERS IDRS, NATIONAL RATINGS AND VIABILITY RATING The Issuer Default Ratings (IDR), National Ratings and Viability Rating reflect a holistic assessment of JSH's credit profile and that of its two fully owned subsidiaries. We do not believe the profiles of the three entities can be meaningfully disentangled due to high integration, consolidated supervision and limited restriction of capital and liquidity fungibility within the group. The affirmation reflects the group's stable credit profile, largely underpinned by its sustained modest core profitability, moderate risk taking and low use of leverage. Fitch believes the group's credit strength will remain constrained by its weak franchise. The group does not have pricing power in either the securities or commercial banking business and lacks a competitive niche. This makes it vulnerable to fluctuations in the operating environment and capital markets, leading to variable performance over economic cycles. JSH's return on assets has ranged from 0.5%-1% during 2012-2016. The Stable Outlook reflects our expectation that the group will continue to expand selectively with adequate underwriting prudence. Its balance sheet has only grown modestly at about 3.6% per year over 2012-2016. Thus, the group is likely to maintain strong capitalisation with manageable asset quality. Fitch believes the group's intention to increase its small-to-medium enterprise exposure and its proprietary trading position will not alter our assessment of the group's risk appetite, which we consider as modest relative to peers. For example, JSIB's loan composition is not overly aggressive, with about 70% of its loan book being secured. About half of the loan portfolio consisted of mortgages, which are mostly owner-occupied and have a loan/value ratio of about 40%. Furthermore, stockholdings accounted for about 3% of total group assets, with a large part of its investment portfolio being government bonds and investment-grade private-sector bonds. The 'A-(twn)' National Ratings of the three entities correspond to their IDRs and reflect moderate default risk relative to domestic issuers in Taiwan. JSIB's Support Rating of '5' and Support Rating Floor of 'No Floor' reflect our belief that there is low likelihood of sovereign support due to its small deposit franchise and limited systemic importance. SUBORDINATED DEBT JSIB's non-Basel III-compliant subordinated bond is rated one notch below its National Long-Term Rating to reflect its subordinated status and the absence of going-concern loss-absorption features. JSIB's Taiwanese Basel III Tier 2 (BIIIT2) capital is rated two notches below its anchor rating - the National Long-Term Rating. This comprises of zero notching for non-performance risk and two notches for loss severity. Wider notching than Fitch's base case of one notch reflects the poor recovery prospects for Taiwanese BIIIT2 debt at the point of non-viability or government receivership. Taiwan's authorities would only move a bank into insolvency administration when it reaches a very low capital level or a 2% capital adequacy ratio, reducing the recovery prospects for BIIIT2 debt. The above notching practices are in accordance with Fitch's criteria on rating bank regulatory capital and similar securities. RATING SENSITIVITIES IDRS, NATIONAL RATINGS AND VIABILITY RATING The group's IDRs and National Ratings are Viability Rating-driven and have a Stable Outlook. The ratings have already captured its weakened securities franchise, as brokerage market share has dropped to 3.2% in 2016, from 4.1% in 2010. Rating downgrade pressure is limited unless the group incurs unexpected large trading losses or loan impairments that significantly weaken its capital profile. An upgrade is likely if the group can improve its franchise meaningfully, bringing up its profitability to sector average while maintaining stable risk appetite. SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR The Support Rating and Support Rating Floor are sensitive to any change in assumptions around the propensity or ability of Taiwan's government to provide timely support to JSIB. SUBORDINATED DEBT Any rating action on JSIB's National Long-Term Rating could trigger a similar move on its debt ratings. The full list of rating actions is as follows: JSH Long-Term Foreign-Currency IDR affirmed at 'BB+'; Outlook Stable Short-Term Foreign-Currency IDR affirmed at 'B' National Long-Term Rating affirmed at 'A-(twn)'; Outlook Stable National Short-Term Rating affirmed at 'F2(twn)' Viability Rating affirmed at 'bb+' JSIB Long-Term Foreign-Currency IDR affirmed at 'BB+'; Outlook Stable Short-Term Foreign-Currency IDR affirmed at 'B' National Long-Term Rating affirmed at 'A-(twn)'; Outlook Stable National Short-Term Rating affirmed at 'F2(twn)' Viability Rating affirmed at 'bb+' Subordinated debt (non-Basel III-compliant) rating affirmed at 'BBB+(twn)' Subordinated debt (Basel III Tier 2 capital) rating affirmed at 'BBB(twn)' Support Rating affirmed at '5' Support Rating Floor affirmed at 'NF' JSS Long-Term Foreign-Currency IDR affirmed at 'BB+'; Stable Outlook Short-Term Foreign-Currency IDR affirmed at 'B' National Long-Term Rating affirmed at 'A-(twn)'; Stable Outlook National Short-Term Rating affirmed at 'F2(twn)' In accordance with Fitch's policies, the issuer appealed and provided additional information to Fitch that resulted in a rating action that is different than the original rating committee outcome.

Inflation will accelerate gradually toward 1 percent later this year, say analysts, but it will still fall short of that both in this fiscal year and next, the poll predicted. In May, core consumer prices rose just 0.4 percent on a year ago.  Wages and prices are rising but not as quickly as the BOJ forecasts. The bank will have to postpone the timing to achieve its price target at some point,  said Hidenobu Tokuda, senior economist at Mizuho Research Institute.  The BOJ isn't likely to change its 2 percent price target itself but there is a chance that the central bank will make it as a medium- to long-term target.  As the economy strengthens, the BOJ this week is set to raise its growth forecast but cut its inflation outlook, sources told Reuters. Twenty-seven of 33 analysts say the BOJ will push back its estimate of when it will meet its 2 percent inflation target, currently pegged to fiscal 2018. But a majority of analysts surveyed July 6-17 say the BOJ won't change the target.  The Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank set the price target at 2 percent, so if the BOJ does not keep the same level, the yen could strengthen and damage its stability,  said Atsushi Takeda, chief economist at Itochu Economic Research Institute.  So I don't expect the BOJ will change the 2 percent price target itself under the current policy framework.  The median forecast from the poll forecast the core consumer price index, which includes oil products but not fresh foods, will rise just 0.7 percent this fiscal year to March 2018 and 0.8 percent the following year. The world's third-largest economy will grow 1.4 percent in the current fiscal year but then lose some momentum, expanding 1.1 percent in the following year, the poll predicted. Another Delay Under Governor Haruhiko Kuroda, the BOJ in 2013 adopted an aggressive stimulus program with the aim to lift inflation to 2 percent in about two years and pull Japan out of prolonged deflation. The BOJ has had to repeatedly delay the timing of reaching this goal despite the bank's ultra-loose policy. More than three years of huge asset purchases failed to boost inflation, so the central bank switched its policy framework last September to focus on market interest rates instead of the pace of money printing. Even though inflation remains low, yields on Japanese government bonds (JGB) have risen as the Fed raises interest rates and the ECB contemplates when it may have to reduce its monthly asset purchases. The BOJ will likely keep its 10-year JGB yield target around zero throughout next year but some expect the bank will raise it as far as 0.5 percent by later next year, the poll showed.  There may be a chance for the BOJ to raise the long-term interest rate target next year if gains in wages and prices stemming from demand rise are confirmed,  said Harumi Taguchi, principal economist at IHS Economics.  But inflation expectations are weak and it is difficult to forecast when the BOJ would do so.  The poll found 31 of 37 economists project the BOJ's next policy move, if it decides to change course, would be to pare back its ultra-loose monetary policy. A majority said that would be some time later next year or after but a few expect the BOJ will be able to withdraw from easing policy this year or early next.

The asset class helped to boost the fund's total year-end returns to 11.2 percent, exceeding expectations for the first time since 2014. Private equity has been CalPERS' best performing asset class in the past two decades and accounts for about $26 billion of its portfolio. But CalPERS mainly invests in private equity funds and has been criticized for accepting the high fees and limited disclosures typically associated with the asset class. The shift in strategy, if adopted, is likely to require a considerable investment in staff and expertise in the years ahead to handle the strategic shift.  CalPERS Chief Investment Officer Ted Eliopoulos told Reuters he would recommend CalPERS  explore setting up a separate vehicle  for direct investments and expand the current co-investment program. Eliopoulos suggested CalPERS focus on opportunities that do not compete with its current private equity investments, such as owning companies for longer than 10 years, and investing in technology and life science companies.  CalPERS has a unique opportunity to be a leader in the co-investment space,  Sandra Horbach, U.S. buyouts co-head at The Carlyle Group, told the board on Monday.  CalPERS' massive size would make it a formidable player and allow the fund to dictate some investment terms, Horbach said. Most U.S.-based funds shy away from such investments, while Canadian pension funds are considered leaders in the strategy. By its own account, CalPERS has developed somewhat of a negative image among private equity firms as being difficult to work with and slow to make decisions, John Cole, CalPERS investment director, told the board at Monday's meeting. A number of funds  have told us that we have become too unpredictable to do business with, and many larger general partners are cutting back the amounts that they are willing to allocate to us in their new funds , Cole said.

In an attempt to curb China's addiction to debt and defuse financial risks, authorities have intensified curbs on speculative investments, shadowbanking activity and excessive credit growth over the past year.

(Reuters) - The California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS) on Monday said it was considering making direct investments in private companies, a potential major shift in strategy that would be the first such action by a U.S. public pension fund.

Born in 1911, a year before the Titanic sank, Shigeaki Hinohara was for decades the director and public face of St. Luke's International Hospital in Tokyo, so well known as an  international  hospital that it treated luminaries such as Paul McCartney when he fell ill during a 2014 Japanese tour.  He was working at St Luke's as early as 1945, when he treated victims of the World War Two Tokyo firebombing that left vast swathes of the city in ruins.   From the start of this year his health wasn't so good, but until then he'd drop into the hospital every so often to conduct exams and talk with patients,  a hospital spokeswoman said. An early advocate of healthier living to stave off the ills of ageing, Hinohara in 1954 introduced Japan's so-called  human dry-dock  system of comprehensive annual physical exams, part of the preventive medical system said to contribute to Japan's longevity. The author of 75 books, including a bestseller on living well penned at 101, Hinohara was also a frequent guest on Japanese television, where he unveiled a lifestyle that included orange juice with olive oil for breakfast and said that energy comes from feeling good, not fixed rules about living.  We all remember how as children, when we were having fun, we often forgot to eat or sleep,  he was quoted as saying.  I believe we can keep that attitude as adults - it's best not to tire the body with too many rules such as lunchtime and bedtime.

The quake, which was initially measured by the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center at 6.3, was 44 km (27 miles) deep and centered 194 km (120 miles) southwest of Puquio, Peru, the USGS said. The quake was felt in Peru's second largest city of Arequipa and in northern Chile, local media reported. Mining company Southern Copper had no reports of damage at its two mines in southern Peru, company spokesman Guillermo Vildalón said. Arequipa region's President Yamila Osorio said on Twitter authorities were monitoring rocks that had fallen on local roads. Though the earthquake appeared not to have caused injuries, residents of small towns like Caravelí were startled and ran out of their homes, Caraveli mayor Santiago Neyra told local radio station RPP.
