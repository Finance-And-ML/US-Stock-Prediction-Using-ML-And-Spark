But once the game began, the night belonged to three of Big Papi's former teammates as Rick Porcello, Sandy Leon and Hanley Ramirez led the Boston Red Sox to a 9-4 victory over the Los Angeles Angels in the opener of a three-game series.  It was, to me, vintage Rick Porcello,  Boston manager John Farrell said after his reigning Cy Young Award winner went 6 1/3 innings for his first win his last six starts -- thus avoiding becoming the first 10-game loser in the majors.  The sink had returned to his two-seamer and it's a tribute to the work that he continues to do.  In other words, he kept the ball down, which allowed him to give up a run on five hits until one out in the seventh. Then, as his pitches rose, three straight extra base hits ended his night. Leon (3-for-4) drove in a career-high four runs for the fourth time in his career, with a two-run homer and two-run double and Ramirez hit a two-run homer -- the 250th home run of his career.  We got a good team,  Leon said.  I think we were going to just get a win for David today. He deserved that.  Related CoveragePreview: Angels at Red SoxLos Angeles Angels - PlayerWatchBoston Red Sox - PlayerWatchDespite his long winless streak, Porcello has notched nine straight outings of at least six innings. He struck out eight and has 61 strikeouts and 10 walks in 68 2/3 innings over his last 11 starts.  I felt good,  Porcello said.  Obviously I would have liked to have finished the ballgame off better than I did, but I felt good from the get-go.  The Red Sox (40-32) scored three runs on one hit off Alex Meyer (3-4) in the first inning, Meyer wild-pitched home two of the runs after Xander Bogaerts' RBI double -- in a 38-pitch first inning.  It's unacceptable,  said Meyer, who had thrown six scoreless frames in his previous start.  You can't go out there and put two guys on before basically the game starts. (I) just put them on first and second (with walks).  It's frustrating and there's not much more to say than that. The first inning was just not acceptable.  Ramirez hit his 10th homer of the season in the fourth, while Leon connected in the sixth and then doubled home the pair in the eighth. Martin Maldonado, Cliff Pennington and Kole Calhoun had RBI doubles for the Angels (38-39, 12-12 without the injured Mike Trout) in the seventh. Eduardo Paredes made his major league debut and Huston Street, activated Thursday, pitched for the first time this season. With Red Sox greats Carl Yastrzemski, Pedro Martinez, Jim Rice and Wade Boggs among those on hand, Ortiz received his usual ovation from the Papi-loving crowd pre-game.  Walking out there and seeing -- there wasn't an empty seat,  he said later.  It made me feel like one of those important games that we have where the fans want to be there from the very beginning and show some love and support. It was pretty amazing.  Said Angels manager Mike Scioscia:  I know everyone in our organization has the utmost respect for David and what he did. A lot of his successes, unfortunately, in playoffs were at our expense, but I know everyone respects his career, respects him as a person. That was a terrific honor they did for him tonight and it was fun to watch.   It was a special night,  said Dustin Pedroia, who represented the 2017 team with pre-game words for Ortiz.  Obviously he means a lot to us and the city ... he played with a lot of guys and he affected them in a major way.  Pedroia was the final speaker before Ortiz, noting Ortiz was  family.  Ortiz, dabbing tears, then said:  The little guy made me cry.  NOTES: Veteran RHP Doug Fister, who opted out of a minor league deal with the Angels after three starts, was claimed off waivers by the Red Sox and will start against the Angels in Sunday's series finale. ... Boston 2B Dustin Pedroia, who missed the three games in Kansas City after being struck in the back with a pitch Sunday in Houston, was a late addition to the lineup, with Josh Rutledge nursing a sore hip. ... 3B Jhonny Peralta signed a minor league deal with the Red Sox and will report to Pawtucket. ...

PETERSBURG, Fla. -- The Tampa Bay Rays moved four games above .500 for the first time in nearly two years, surging past the Baltimore Orioles with an easy 15-5 win on Friday night at Tropicana Field. The Rays (40-36) jumped out to a 9-2 lead in the first three innings and reset their season high for scoring, getting home runs from Derek Norris, Shane Peterson and Logan Morrison. The slumping Orioles (35-38) matched a dubious major league record by allowing at least five runs in 20 straight games -- the first team to do so since the 1924 Philadelphia Phillies.  We feel good about where we are at,  Rays manager Kevin Cash said.  It was nice to see us cash in and capitalize on those runs and not leave the guys on base.  Tampa Bay roughed up starter Ubaldo Jimenez (2-3), who didn't survive the third inning. Rays starter Chris Archer (6-4) threw six innings, not needing his best stuff to win his second straight start. Related CoverageBaltimore Orioles - PlayerWatchTampa Bay Rays - PlayerWatchThe Rays got four RBIs each from Evan Longoria and Peterson, who was called up before the game and had a two-run home run.  Anytime we get a win and you have a chance to help the team, it's awesome, especially at the big-league level,  said Peterson, whose four RBIs were a career high.  You go out there and try to do too much, next thing you know, you look up and you're not there anymore. For me, it's just do what I can do, do the best I can do and whatever happens, happens.  Tampa Bay hasn't been four games over .500 at any point since July 1, 2015, but has now won three of four games on their current homestand. Morrison's home run was his 22nd, extending his team lead as he makes a case for the All-Star Game.  We're going to go as far we let ourselves go,  Morrison said. The Rays set their season high with 14 runs by the fifth inning, with unlikely stars leading the way. Norris, potentially being designated for assignment this weekend, had three hits, including a two-run home run. Jimenez allowed nine runs on seven hits before his early exit. He walked the first two batters on 10 pitches, advanced them with a wild pitch and saw both score on a two-run single by Longoria. Morrison followed with an RBI triple and scored on an infield groundout for a 4-0 lead.  It's tough. Sucks the air out of you a little bit,  Orioles manager Buck Showalter said of the rough start.  Our guys got back in it at 4-2, just couldn't get any shutdown innings. You walk seven or eight guys and hit somebody. I think we had the same number of hits they had (11 each).  Archer gave up two runs on three hits in the second, but Longoria's sacrifice fly extended the lead to 5-2 in the second. Peterson hit a two-run home run in the third, and then Norris did the same to chase Jimenez.  Command,  Showalter said.  Never really had it. We're trying to squeeze every out we can out of him, to try to take some load off the bullpen. We couldn't get him through any type of length of an outing. You come out and walk the first two guys, it doesn't bode well.  Jonathan Schoop's two-run double in the fourth cut Tampa Bay's lead to 9-4, but the Rays got five more runs in the fifth off reliever Miguel Castro. Castro came in with the bases loaded and all three runs scored, first on a bases-loaded walk to Longoria, then back-to-back infield errors. Peterson's sacrifice fly made it 14-4. NOTES: The Orioles got RHP Darren O'Day back from the 10-day disabled list, and he pitched a scoreless eighth inning. RHP Gabriel Ynoa was optioned to Triple-A Norfolk to make room. ... The Rays placed OF Colby Rasmus on the 10-day disabled list, retroactive to June 19, with left hip tendinitis. Orioles manager Buck Showalter was back in the dugout after missing Wednesday's game for the birth of his first grandchild.

But the Marlins, for the second time in three days, beat a 2016 playoff team despite getting three or less hits. First it was the Washington Nationals on Wednesday. On Friday, it was the defending World Series champion Chicago Cubs. It helps, though, when one of those three hits on Friday was a home run by Giancarlo Stanton and Jose Urena pitched six scoreless innings. To cap it off, the bullpen did its job flawlessly. Add it all up, and Miami shut out Chicago 2-0 at Marlins Park. One night after the Cubs routed Miami 11-1, Urena (6-2) held the Cubs to five hits and three walks (with three strikeouts). Relievers Kyle Barraclough, David Phelps and A.J. Ramos completed the shutout. Ramos earned his 11th save of the season. Urena, who has won a career-high five consecutive decisions, impressed Cubs third baseman Kris Bryant. Related CoveragePreview: Cubs at MarlinsChicago Cubs - PlayerWatchMiami Marlins - PlayerWatch The guy went up to 100 mph with sink,  Bryant said. The Cubs were familiar with Urena going into the game because he had defeated them as recently as June 7 in Chicago. But he looked different this time out.  They changed their tactic,  Cubs manager Joe Maddon said of Urena and the Marlins.  Their guy (Urena) threw a lot more breaking balls than last time, and he was good with it.  Perhaps that is part of the maturation of Urena, who leads all Marlins pitchers with his six wins.  We know the power is there,  Marlins manager Don Mattingly said of Urena's fastball.  But he's pitching more now.  He's using his changeup. He's using his slider. You still want him to continue to improve, but he's using them, and that makes you think as a hitter.  Stanton's solo homer -- his ninth game-winning RBI this season -- gave Miami a 1-0 lead in the third. He hit a curveball on the outside part of the plate for his 19th long ball of the season, and he also doubled and was hit by a pitch in a 2-for-3 performance as Miami improved to 33-39. The Cubs (37-36) got a good pitching performance by John Lackey (5-8), who allowed three hits, two walks and two runs, one earned, in six innings. Lackey has lost his past three decisions against the Marlins. Offensively, Chicago hit into three double plays and went 0-for-4 with runners in scoring position. The Cubs managed just one extra-base hit, a two-out double by rookie right fielder Ian Happ in the first inning. Urena got the next batter, Addison Russell, to ground out to end the threat. The Cubs threatened again in the fifth. With two outs, Bryant drew a five-pitch walk. Happ, who has six hits in the past two games, singled to put runners on the corners, but Russell struck out looking as Urena escaped again.  I just focused on putting the ball down in the zone,  Urena said.  That's how I can get people out.  Miami extended its lead to 2-0 in the sixth. Dee Gordon blooped a soft single over the shortstop, stole second, advanced to third on catcher Miguel Montero's throwing error. After Stanton was hit by a pitch, Gordon scored on Christian Yelich's sacrifice fly.  Whatever,  Stanton said when asked his reaction to getting hit in the back with that pitch from Lackey.  Do your job, Yelly.  Yelich indeed did his job, and the Marlins emerged with the win, even with very little offensive firepower. NOTES: Marlins 2B Dee Gordon stole his 28th base, tying him for second place in the National League. ... Miami activated 3B Martin Prado, who went 0-for-3. Prado had been on the disabled list since May 7 due to his second hamstring injury of the year. He hit in the sixth hole because RF Giancarlo Stanton has found his niche is the second spot in the order. ... Miami designated INF Christian Colon for assignment. ... Miami is reportedly shopping starting SS Adeiny Hechavarria, who is on the disabled list due to an oblique injury. The Orioles, Rays and Cardinals are reportedly interested in Hechavarria, who has been replaced by rookie SS J.T. Riddle. Miami could also turn to SS Miguel Rojas when he gets healthy. ... With SS Addison Russell and RF Ian Happ each going 4-for-5 on Thursday, it was the first time since 1913 that the Cubs had two players age 23 or younger each collect at least four hits in a game. ...

The U.N. secretary-general on Tuesday appointed a new special envoy for Haiti tasked with leading fundraising efforts for the plan to beat cholera, introduced in 2010 when peacekeepers dumped infected sewage into a river.  We acknowledge that there's a problem and we are here to reiterate the commitment of the United Nations and the international community to work together to fight this problem and to work to solve it,  Bolivia's U.N. Ambassador Sacha Sergio Llorentty Soliz told journalists at the national palace. Llorentty is also president of the U.N. Security Council for the month of June. Aviol Fleurant, Haiti's acting minister of foreign affairs, said the U.N. Security Council and the government had discussed plans for better management of aid in a closed-door meeting.  A large part of aid travels through NGOs ... which could be used to efficiently and sustainably finance the implementation of public policy through governmental channels,  he said.

The U.N. does not accept legal responsibility for the outbreak of the disease, which causes uncontrollable diarrhea.

The beauty salon, designed by owner Huda Quhshi to cater mostly to Muslim women, opened in January in the Bay Ridge neighborhood of Brooklyn.  I actually only started wearing the hijab one year ago,  said Shehadeh, an undergraduate studying math and economics at Fordham University in New York.  I always wanted to, but I wasn't ready. It was actually during Ramadan last year, one week before Eid that I had this feeling to wear the hijab.  Shehadeh, a Palestinian-American, was with her two sisters, Shireen, 26, and Nisrien, 18, and aunt, Najah, 37. They reminisced about meeting Quhshi two years ago when the beauty entrepreneur was hired to do make-up at a family wedding.     Quhshi, 37, said that as a Yemeni-American whose cultural norms often barred women from the workplace, she did not think creating a space where conservative Muslim women could receive beauty services in a comfortable environment was possible. Between Wednesday and Friday, Quhshi said she received 48 customers for Eid services.  Most salons aren't all women,  said Shehadeh, who plans to celebrate Eid on a Staten Island beach with her family on Sunday, marking the end of Islam's holy month of Ramadan.  Here we feel comfortable. We're not paranoid of someone walking in.

Scalise was shot in the hip on June 14 when a lone gunman opened fire on Republican lawmakers practicing for an annual charity game against the Democrats. He entered the hospital in critical condition and has undergone several surgeries.  Congressman Steve Scalise’s continued good progress allowed him to be transferred out of the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) on Thursday,  said MedStar Washington Hospital Center.  He remains in fair condition as he continues an extended period of healing and rehabilitation,  the hospital said in a statement posted on its web site. Matt Mika, a lobbyist wounded in the same shooting at an Alexandria, Virginia ball field, has been released from George Washington University Hospital, his family said in a statement on Friday. Local media reported that Mika, a Tyson Foods lobbyist, was visited before leaving in his hospital room by Jayson Werth, a Washington Nationals star player. Scalise, 51, is the No. 3 Republican in the House. He, Mika and others were shot or otherwise injured in a mass shooting carried out by James Hodgkinson, 66, of Belleville, Illinois, who later died in the hospital of gunshot wounds. The FBI, which investigated the incident, said on Wednesday that Hodgkinson did not post online any threats against or references to members of Congress before the attack. The agent said authorities found a laptop computer, a cell phone and a digital camera in Hodgkinson's car after the incident, and 200 rounds of ammunition in a storage locker Hodgkinson had rented in April in Alexandria. The shooting occurred as 25 to 30 Republican members of the House and Senate had gathered for an early morning practice a day before the annual charity game, which was played on June 15. With many players on both teams wearing hats to honor Scalise, the game was won by the Democrats, 11-2, but they loaned the trophy to the Republicans until Scalise is better.

Brazil is the world's largest meat exporter but business has been marred by scandal and safety concerns and on Thursday the United States barred imports from there. The ban will not be an issue for American diners hungry for Brazilian dishes such as picanha, a famous cut from a cow's rump.  It doesn't even come close to beef from Colorado,  Joao de Matos, one of the owners of top-notch Brazilian steakhouse Churrascaria Plataforma in New York City, said of his homeland's beef in a telephone interview.  De Matos also buys meat from Texas, the biggest cattle producing state, and said he probably would not buy from Brazil even if the ban is lifted.  Our supplier is the same that we had for 21 years,  de Matos said.  He doesn't even know what Brazilian beef is.  In Chicago, the historic center of the massive U.S. meat packing industry, managers of restaurants such as Carnivale and Zed451 said their themes may be Brazilian but the beef isn't.  We try to use local vendors but several chefs' recipes are  specific to Brazilian regions,  said an employee at Carnivale.  And we do have a couple of meats that come from Australia.  Brazilian steakhouse chain Fogo de Chao has more than two dozen restaurants across the United States, as well as nine in Brazil. None of the meat used at their U.S. restaurants comes from Brazil, Mary Nelson, a spokeswoman for the chain, said in an email. A little over 7,000 metric tons of fresh beef has been imported to the United States from Brazil so far in 2017, said Eric Mittenthal, spokesman for trade association the North American Meat Institute. That is a tiny fraction of total U.S. meat consumption, he added. Much of the Brazilian meat is imported as trimmings, which typically end up used in hot dogs, meatballs and other processed meat products. Reporting by Jonathan Allen in New York and Renita D.

Officials in Canada and the European Union also said they had rejected some shipments of Brazilian beef in recent months. Brazil's government and meat industry said most problems stemmed from vaccinations and were being addressed. The U.S. Department of Agriculture described repeated import violations involving raw beef from seven Brazilian facilities,  indicating a  system-wide problem,  according to a letter seen by Reuters on Friday explaining the reason for Thursday's ban. While fresh beef shipments to the United States represent only 1 percent Brazil's beef exports, the ban there and scrutiny elsewhere threatens to tarnish the country's powerhouse protein industry, which has suffered a series of recent scandals.  If you look at the financial aspect, it's important for the country but the bigger damage is to our image,  said Antonio Camardelli, head of Brazilian meat exporters association Abiec. He said USDA approval for Brazil's fresh beef, which was only granted last year, was expected to open the door to bigger fresh beef importers such as Japan and South Korea.  We worked a long time to open the U.S. market because it's a passport to other markets,  Camardelli said. Brazil Deputy Agriculture Minister Eumar Novacki said the problems laid out by the USDA posed no risk to public health. Novacki told reporters at a news conference that some cattle had adverse reactions to certain vaccines. Related CoverageBrazilian restaurants in U.S. not bothered by beef banAmong the violations the USDA detected were abscesses, unidentified foreign material and  ingesta,  which can include any food, drink or medicine that cattle consume. Brazilian beef exports to the United States from companies including Marfrig Global Foods SA and Minerva SA also have been missing shipping marks and had labeling problems on containers, according to USDA data. Novacki recognized there were flaws in Brazil's inspection system but suggested there could be  commercial motivations  for the U.S. ban. He said U.S. and European authorities had stepped up inspections of Brazilian beef in recent months. Since March, the USDA has rejected 11 percent of Brazilian fresh beef products, compared to the rejection rate of 1 percent for shipments from the rest of the world. The shipments, totaling about 1.9 million pounds, raised concerns about public health, animal health and sanitation, the USDA said. FILE PHOTO: A man cools cattle on a beached boat in the Amazon river, in the city of Manaus, Brazil, October 26, 2015.Bruno Kelly/File photoCamardelli said about 120 containers with some 3,000 tonnes of Brazilian meat currently are at sea headed to the United States. European and Canadian officials also described issues found in inspections of imported Brazilian beef.    The EU said it had rejected some shipments of Brazilian beef due to the presence of Shiga toxin-producing E. coli. Some Brazilian poultry shipments were refused because of salmonella. Canada has rejected six shipments of Brazilian beef out of 191 meat shipments since April 10, according to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency.

Novacki said Brazil was working with European officials to allay concerns and declined to comment on issues in Canada. The problems, detailed by representatives in response to questions by Reuters, illustrate that Brazil meat industry is still under a cloud of scrutiny. Three months ago, Brazilian meatpackers were hit with a scandal involving alleged bribery of health officials, which briefly shut Brazil's protein exports out of major global markets from China to Europe. Shares of JBS and Marfrig fell about 1 percent in Sao Paulo. Marfrig said beef exports from Brazil to the U.S. market have contributed less than 1 percent of its revenue this year. JBS declined to comment on the matter.  Minerva, whose shares were up slightly, said it would ship fresh beef to the U.S. market from Uruguay rather than Brazil, adding that the change would not affect its export volumes.

Five Republican senators have announced they will not support the bill, which is designed to repeal and replace Obamacare, in its current form. White House officials said on Friday that Trump has been in touch with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and made calls on Thursday and Friday to other lawmakers. Trump's role is expected to become more pronounced in coming days as the vote nears. Senate Republican leaders may rely on the deal-making former businessman to lean on conservative senators who are balking at the bill.  We're pleasantly surprised with a lot of the support that's already come out and I think we'll continue to work through (it,) in particular the four individuals who have expressed some ideas and concerns,  White House spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters at a White House briefing. With all Democrats expected to oppose the measure, the Republicans can afford to lose the support of only two of their 52 members if they want to pass the legislation. After Spicer spoke, Republican Senator Dean Heller became the fifth Republican opponent on Friday, saying he would not support the bill in its current form.   This bill that's currently in front of the United States Senate is not the answer,  Heller, a moderate who is up for re-election in 2018, said at a news conference in Las Vegas. Related CoverageFactbox: Where Republican U.S. senators stand on healthcare billThat could add Heller's name to Trump's call list. A White House official said the Trump has pushed his team to stay involved and plans to flex his negotiating muscle, the official said. An outside political group aligned with the White House, America First Policies, said it is planning an advertising campaign targeting Heller for his opposition to the bill. Healthcare stocks closed down 0.1 percent on Friday, clawing back some losses after the sector dropped sharply late in the session on Heller's announcement. The Senate's 142-page proposal, worked out in secret by a group led by McConnell, aims to deliver on a central Trump campaign promise to undo former President Barack Obama's signature healthcare law, which has provided coverage to 20 million Americans since it was passed in 2010.

Four Conservatives Oppose Bill On Thursday, four of the Senate's most conservative members said the new plan failed to rein in the federal government's role. Rand Paul, who has rejected the plan along with fellow Republican Senators Ted Cruz, Mike Lee and Ron Johnson, said fundamental problems remained that would leave taxpayers subsidizing health insurance companies. Slideshow (3 Images)Trump, in an interview with Fox News that aired on Friday morning, called the group of conservative lawmakers  four very good people.   It's not that they're opposed,  he said.  They'd like to get certain changes. And we'll see if we can take care of that.  Trump said getting approval would require traveling a  very, very narrow path  but that  I think we're going to get there.   It's going to be a good bill,  Trump said in a separate Fox News interview to air on Sunday.   For the House of Representatives' version of healthcare, Trump held regular meetings with representatives at the White House. He celebrated the bill's narrow passage last month in a Rose Garden event with House Republican leaders.  Trump later criticized the House bill privately as  mean  and this week called for a health plan  with heart.  He indicated the Senate plan met that request. McConnell said in an interview with Reuters last month that he told Trump early on in the process that he did not need his help but that there may be a role for him later. The Senate bill maintains much of the structure of the House's but differs in key ways. It would phase out Obamacare's expansion of the Medicaid program for the poor more gradually, waiting until after the 2020 presidential election, but would enact deeper cuts starting in 2025. It also would provide more generous tax subsidies than the House bill to help low-income people buy private insurance.

The outside cladding engulfed in June 14's deadly blaze has since been shown to fail all safety tests, police said. They have already seized material from a number of undisclosed organizations. Fire safety checks are now taking place on public buildings across Britain. Late on Friday, one municipal authority in north London began to evacuate nearly 4,000 people from five tower blocks after firefighters said it was unsafe for them to stay. Detective Superintendent Fiona McCormack said experts had now concluded that the earlier fire, the mostly deadly blaze in London since World War Two, had started in a fridge freezer. The blaze has provoked anger and heaped pressure on Prime Minister Theresa May, who is fighting for her political survival after her party lost its parliamentary majority in a snap election at a time when Britain is beginning divorce talks with the European Union. The speed at which the fire engulfed the 24-storey Grenfell Tower raised questions about the external cladding on the block. Asked if the insulation and aluminum tiles used were acceptable for such buildings, McCormack told reporters:  No they're not.   All I can say at the moment is they don't pass any of the safety tests. So that will form part of what is a manslaughter investigation.  As well as possible manslaughter, police will consider health and safety offences and breaches of other building regulations. McCormack said all companies involved in the building and refurbishment of the building would be reviewed. Britain also ordered an immediate technical examination of the Hotpoint (WHR.N) fridge model FF175BP, which had not been subject to any recall to establish whether further action should be taken, but said there was no need for owners to switch off their appliances.

Whirlpool owns the Hotpoint brand in the Europe and Asia Pacific regions.

We are working with the authorities to obtain access to the appliance so that we can assist with the ongoing investigations,  said Whirlpool, the world's largest maker of home appliances.  Words cannot express our sorrow at this terrible tragedy,  Whirlpool said in a statement. The company said 64,000 such fridge freezers were made by Indesit between 2006 and 2009 when the model was discontinued, some years before Whirlpool acquired Indesit.

The government said it was urgently conducting tests on some 600 high-rise buildings in England which have exterior cladding, often added to insulate them or improve the external appearance of ageing blocks. Some councils have begun removing the panels. May, who faced criticism for slow public reaction to the fire, said on Twitter that her thoughts were with the 800 households being evacuated from a group of tower blocks in north London on Friday evening. Residents complained of first hearing about the evacuation from the media and getting very short notice to leave from city officials going door to door. Slideshow (8 Images) It was farcical communication. You don't get everyone to leave this quickly,  21-year-old Daniel Tackaberry told Reuters outside a nearby sports center where the local council had laid out air beds for people for whom they could not find hotels. Broadcaster Sky News showed one resident, Abdul, who has cerebral palsy and uses a wheelchair, who said he had been told there was no hotel for him and he had to stay on an air bed. The council's leader, Georgia Gould, said in a statement outside the council's offices that it would take up to four weeks to repair the blocks that were evacuated and later added in a radio interview that nearly 4,000 residents were affected. Ed Miliband, the former leader of the opposition Labour Party, said on Twitter that May should have convened a central government emergency committee to assist the local council. Grenfell Tower, in west London, had undergone an 8.7 million pound ($11 million) refurbishment that was completed in 2016, but residents of the more than 120 apartments had complained about its fire safety.  McCormack said the police investigation would look at the entire facade of the building, how the building was constructed and the refurbishment work. She said it would examine all aspects of the cladding: the aluminum tiles, the insulation behind it, how it was fitted to building and the installation. In addition to the criminal investigation, police and firefighters were continuing painstaking efforts to locate the victims. So far only nine people have been formally identified and police said the remains of some might never be found, the blaze having been so fierce. Some residents believe the official number of the dead or missing presumed dead was lower than the true figure. McCormack acknowledged they might not know everyone who was in the building as some people might fear coming forward because they were in the country illegally.  She said the government had given assurances they were not interested in anyone's immigration status.  I remain really concerned though that we do not have a complete picture,  she said.  I fear that there are more.

U.S. District Judge John Kane granted the petition filed by Jamshid Muhtorov, who claims he should be given bail after repeated delays in the case violated his right to a speedy trial. Kane, who said he “weighed heavily” his decision given the seriousness of the charges, did not order Muhtorov to be released immediately and scheduled a hearing for next week to set the conditions of his bond. “There is a presumption of flight risk and dangerousness that attaches to Mr. Muhtorov because he is charged with conspiracy and attempt to provide material support to terrorism,” Kane wrote in his 11-page order. Muhtorov, 40, is accused of trying to smuggle smart phones and other electronic equipment to the Islamic Jihad Union, a Pakistan-based extremist group that opposes secular rule in Uzbekistan and seeks to install a government based on Islamic law.However, the judge noted that Muhtorov will have spent six years in custody by the time his trial gets under way early next year. He faces a maximum 15 years in prison if convicted. No one died or was injured in the plot, which was thwarted.  “Six years of detention awaiting trial on these charges approaches the range of sentences imposed in other cases,” Kane wrote, calling the situation “unprecedented” in anything he has seen in his 40 years on the federal bench. Citing a gag order Kane imposed at the outset of the case, a spokesman for acting U.S. Attorney Robert Troyer said prosecutors cannot comment on the ruling.     Muhtorov, who lived in suburban Denver, came to the United States as a legal Uzbek refugee.  He was arrested in January 2012 at Chicago’s O’Hare airport as he was attempting to board an overseas flight, according to a FBI arrest warrant affidavit. In Friday’s ruling, Kane said Muhtorov’s “professed desire to join a movement that justifies the murder and maiming of all who dare to think differently than he does on matters of faith and religion deeply offend our values of religious liberty, the sanctity of life, tolerance, justice, and the rule of law.” Nevertheless, Muhtorev’s family ties and evidence suggesting his “bark was more serious than his bite” warranted the granting of a bond, he said.   Reporting by Keith Coffman; Editing by Dan Whitcomb and Cynthia Osterman","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-colorado-terror-idUSKBN19F00V"},

However, drilling a hole into that hopeful scenario is the current bear market in oil prices and an economy showing signs of growth below the pace expected earlier in the year.  A lot of the expectation for a recovery in earnings is predicated on oil prices being around $47-$50 a barrel,  said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer of Hugh Johnson Advisors LLC in Albany, New York.  So if you don't get those numbers, you don't get the strong earnings the stock market needs. This is not trivial stuff. It creates a lot of uncertainty and volatility in forecasts.  U.S. crude futures CLc1 have been pressured lower by a supply glut. They've averaged over $48 per barrel so far this quarter, but traded around $43 on Friday and are down more than 20 percent from February, when they hit an 18-month high. U.S. stocks are in the ninth year of a bull run which has been fueled of late by bets on pro-growth policies from U.S. President Donald Trump. However, with the timetable for reforms stretching further into the future, earnings are seen as a critical support for stock prices. With indexes near record highs, there is speculation among Wall Street analysts about whether a correction is due. Earnings expectations have dropped for 10 of 11 industry groups since early April, with only industrials looking better than they did then. The benchmark S&P; 500 stock index as a whole is expected to deliver 7.9 percent profit growth, down from 15.3 percent in the first quarter, and below the 10.2 percent forecast in April, Thomson Reuters data shows. On Thursday, Nike (NKE.N) will be the first Dow component to report earnings for the most recent quarter. The season heats up in the second week of July. Technology earnings are seen posting double-digit growth, helped by gains in semiconductor companies, and financials are close behind with estimated 8.1-percent profit growth.     While lower energy prices can help some sectors such as industrials and transports, as well as boosting consumer sentiment, high expectations for energy earnings growth mean any stumble will be felt broadly. Energy sector profits are seen up a whopping 683 percent from a year ago, when many companies posted losses, according to Thomson Reuters data. Without energy, profit growth estimates drop to 4.8 percent for the quarter. Expectations for the sector will probably have to come down for the second half of the year if low oil prices persist, said David Joy, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial in Boston.    The one wild card right now is the price of oil. Expectations that are baked into full-year forecasts assume a higher price for oil certainly than we have now,  he said.  Energy has been the weakest performing sector so far this year, with the S&P; energy index .SPNY down near 15 percent. Over-Optimistic Forecasts? The drop in oil prices notwithstanding, some analysts have cautioned that Wall Street has been too optimistic about overall earnings.  Michael Purves, chief global strategist at Weeden & Co, cut his 2017 S&P; 500 earnings estimates from $127 to $116, below the $131.51 consensus, as economic growth and inflation are not as high as expected.  I'm looking for CEOs to start taking down their forecasts for the year,  Purves said.      In fact, the Citigroup U.S. economic surprise index .CESIUSD, a gauge of economic data compared to expectations, this month fell near a six-year low. An Atlanta Federal Reserve model recently forecast second-quarter economic growth coming in at a 2.9-percent annualized pace, down from a previous 3.2 percent. Another hurdle for earnings growth: declining corporate buybacks.  Over the past two years, more than 20 percent of S&P; 500 issues have given at least a 4 percent tailwind for (earnings per share) via reduced share counts,  Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P; Dow Jones Indices, said in a note. For the first quarter of 2017, that rate fell to 14.8 percent of companies, and there are indications of  even less support  in the second quarter, he said.

The sensors are leading Big Oil's mining of so-called big data, with some firms envisioning billions of dollars in savings over time by avoiding outages, managing supplies and identifying safety hazards. The industry has long used sophisticated technologies to find oil and gas. But only recently have oil firms pooled data from across the company for wider operating efficiencies - one of many cost-cutting efforts spurred by the two-year downturn in crude oil CLc1 prices. ConocoPhillips (COP.N) says that sensors scattered across its well fields helped it halve the time it once took to drill new wells in Eagle Ford shale basin of South Texas. By comparing data from hundreds of sensors, its program automatically adjusts the weight placed on a drill bit and its speed, accelerating the extraction of oil, said Matt Fox, ConocoPhillips' executive vice president for strategy, exploration and technology. It is just one application, but if applied to the more than 3,000 wells ConocoPhillips hopes to drill in the Texas basin, those small sensors could lead to  billions and billions of dollars  in savings, Fox said in an interview.  We started using data analytics in our Eagle Ford business,  he said.  And everywhere we look there are applications for this.  The cost and complexity of such systems vary widely. Oil giants such as ConocoPhillips buy a mix of off-the-shelf and custom programs, along with data repositories. The Houston-based producer's employees use Tibco Software Inc's Spotfire data visualization package to analyze information from well sites. Tibco declined to discuss its pricing. Services firms including Schlumberger NV (SLB.N) and General Electric Co (GE.N) oil and gas unit sell sensor-equipped gear, data repositories and software to improve producers' decision-making.  Back when oil traded at more than $100 a barrel - before the price crash in 2014 - data analysis was an  afterthought  for most oil firms, said Binu Mathew, who oversees digital products at GE Oil & Gas. Now - with prices at about $43 a barrel after recovering from a low of about $26 in early 2016 -  the efficiency aspect is far, far more important,  Mathew said. Finding Hidden Value A survey by Ernst & Young last year examined 75 large oil and gas companies and found that 68 percent of them had invested more than $100 million each in data analytics during the past two years. Nearly three quarters of those firms planned to allocate between 6 and 10 percent of their capital budgets to digital technology, the survey found. Effectively mining large data sets could lead to supplanting workers with artificial intelligence and machine learning systems, according to firms selling and buying data-driven technology. Simple sensors already increase safety and savings by eliminating the need to send workers to rigs or production facilities to gather data. Automating drilling decisions can produce more consistent results by cutting out human errors, said Duane Cuku, vice president of sales for rig technology at Precision Drilling Corp (PD.TO).  The driller is now able to focus his attention on the well - and the performance and safety of his crews - as opposed to the manual manipulation of controls,  Cuku said. Occidental Petroleum Corp (OXY.N) also uses an analytical tool to find the best design for hydraulic fracturing wells. A new version of the software analyzes data on well completions and geology to recommend whether injecting steam or water would produce more oil. Abhishek Gaurav, a petroleum engineer for closely-held Texas Standard Oil, said he uses big-data analytics to help his company choose which properties to explore.  Using Spotfire, the same program utilized by Conoco, Standard applies a combination of data science and petroleum engineering to rank asking prices for land based on a variety of completion, production and geological variables - such as the amount of sand that likely would be required to complete a well in a given formation. The technique, Gaurav said, has reduced the time needed for evaluating land parcels from weeks to hours - and resulted in better decisions.  We found value in properties when many other teams did not,  he said. RECRUITING IN CALIFORNIA    Some of the information craved by oil firms isn't so easy to gather or analyze.  Surveys and maps that companies use to acquire acreage for drilling, for instance, are often not digitized. Older company data on wells may be unstructured or spread among suppliers using different storage formats, making integration and analysis a challenge.  General Electric and its oil-and-gas unit are moving aggressively into the business of digitizing industrial equipment for other firms, and have invested in large data processing centers for energy clients.  GE sees huge potential for market growth: A company study estimated that only 3 percent to 5 percent of oil and gas equipment is connected digitally, and less than one percent of the data collected gets used for decision-making, the study found. Getting the industry more fully connected will take time.  There is a huge amount of data prep, data sanitization and data extraction needed for big data to be totally disruptive,  said Kate Richard, chief executive at private equity investor Warwick Energy.  She projects a major payoff from the technology is still five or ten years away. Oklahoma City-based Warwick - which manages interests in thousands of wells across Oklahoma and Texas - is preparing for that payoff by hiring people from tech hubs in California, Richard said.  They all have computer programming and data science backgrounds,  she said.

The outside cladding engulfed in June 14's deadly blaze has since been shown to fail all safety tests, police said. They have already seized material from a number of undisclosed organizations. Fire safety checks are now taking place on public buildings across Britain. Late on Friday, one municipal authority in north London began to evacuate nearly 4,000 people from five tower blocks after firefighters said it was unsafe for them to stay. Detective Superintendent Fiona McCormack said experts had now concluded that the earlier fire, the mostly deadly blaze in London since World War Two, had started in a fridge freezer. The blaze has provoked anger and heaped pressure on Prime Minister Theresa May, who is fighting for her political survival after her party lost its parliamentary majority in a snap election at a time when Britain is beginning divorce talks with the European Union. The speed at which the fire engulfed the 24-storey Grenfell Tower raised questions about the external cladding on the block. Asked if the insulation and aluminum tiles used were acceptable for such buildings, McCormack told reporters:  No they're not.   All I can say at the moment is they don't pass any of the safety tests. So that will form part of what is a manslaughter investigation.  As well as possible manslaughter, police will consider health and safety offences and breaches of other building regulations. McCormack said all companies involved in the building and refurbishment of the building would be reviewed. Britain also ordered an immediate technical examination of the Hotpoint (WHR.N) fridge model FF175BP, which had not been subject to any recall to establish whether further action should be taken, but said there was no need for owners to switch off their appliances. Related CoverageWhirlpool says working with Britain after Hotpoint fridge freezer sparked London blazeWhirlpool's shared closed down 3.3 percent on Friday, wiping almost $500 million off the company's value. Whirlpool owns the Hotpoint brand in the Europe and Asia Pacific regions. In the United States, the Hotpoint brand now belongs to Haier, following the Chinese group's purchase of General Electric Co's (GE.N) appliance business.   We are working with the authorities to obtain access to the appliance so that we can assist with the ongoing investigations,  said Whirlpool, the world's largest maker of home appliances.  Words cannot express our sorrow at this terrible tragedy,  Whirlpool said in a statement. The company said 64,000 such fridge freezers were made by Indesit between 2006 and 2009 when the model was discontinued, some years before Whirlpool acquired Indesit.  A woman looks at flowers, tributes and messages left for the victims of the fire at the Grenfell apartment tower in North Kensington, London, Britain, June 23, 2017.Hannah McKayFocus of Anger The fire has acted as a focal point for anger at local authority funding cuts and, if more buildings are deemed unsafe, the government faces the task of rehousing people within existing social housing facilities which are stretched. The government said it was urgently conducting tests on some 600 high-rise buildings in England which have exterior cladding, often added to insulate them or improve the external appearance of ageing blocks. Some councils have begun removing the panels. May, who faced criticism for slow public reaction to the fire, said on Twitter that her thoughts were with the 800 households being evacuated from a group of tower blocks in north London on Friday evening. Residents complained of first hearing about the evacuation from the media and getting very short notice to leave from city officials going door to door. Slideshow (8 Images) It was farcical communication. You don't get everyone to leave this quickly,  21-year-old Daniel Tackaberry told Reuters outside a nearby sports center where the local council had laid out air beds for people for whom they could not find hotels. Broadcaster Sky News showed one resident, Abdul, who has cerebral palsy and uses a wheelchair, who said he had been told there was no hotel for him and he had to stay on an air bed. The council's leader, Georgia Gould, said in a statement outside the council's offices that it would take up to four weeks to repair the blocks that were evacuated and later added in a radio interview that nearly 4,000 residents were affected. Ed Miliband, the former leader of the opposition Labour Party, said on Twitter that May should have convened a central government emergency committee to assist the local council. Grenfell Tower, in west London, had undergone an 8.7 million pound ($11 million) refurbishment that was completed in 2016, but residents of the more than 120 apartments had complained about its fire safety.  McCormack said the police investigation would look at the entire facade of the building, how the building was constructed and the refurbishment work. She said it would examine all aspects of the cladding: the aluminum tiles, the insulation behind it, how it was fitted to building and the installation. In addition to the criminal investigation, police and firefighters were continuing painstaking efforts to locate the victims. So far only nine people have been formally identified and police said the remains of some might never be found, the blaze having been so fierce. Some residents believe the official number of the dead or missing presumed dead was lower than the true figure. McCormack acknowledged they might not know everyone who was in the building as some people might fear coming forward because they were in the country illegally.  She said the government had given assurances they were not interested in anyone's immigration status.  I remain really concerned though that we do not have a complete picture,  she said.  I fear that there are more.

In a report this week on the May 2016 crash of a Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) Model S that killed a driver who was using Autopilot,  the National Transportation Safety Board demonstrated that users could mostly keep their hands off the wheel for extended periods despite repeated warnings from the vehicle. But the crash underscored a vexing problem for automakers that want to gain an edge by launching technology that completely automates driving tasks. Unless a car is capable of driving itself safely in every situation, drivers will still have to remain alert and ready to take control even if the car is piloting itself.    The NTSB, the federal agency charged with investigating significant transportation accidents, said during a 37-minute section of the 41-minute Tesla trip, the driver kept his hands on the wheel for just 25 seconds, putting his hands on the wheel for one- to- three second increments after getting repeated visual and audible warnings.    General Motors Co (GM.N) delayed introduction of a driver assistance technology called Super Cruise that was initially planned for late last year because it said it was not ready. The technology will go on sale this fall.     Barry Walkup, chief engineer of Super Cruise, said the company added  a driver attention function, to insist on driver supervision.     The system uses a small camera that focuses on the driver and works with infrared lights to track head position to determine where the driver is looking.    If the system - which uses facial recognition software - detects the driver is not paying attention, it will prompt the driver to return attention to the road. If the driver does not respond, it will escalate alerts, including a steering wheel light bar, visual indicators, tactile alerts in the seat and audible alerts. If the driver does not respond, the vehicle is brought to a controlled stop. Volkswagen AG's (VOWG_p.DE) luxury Audi unit has a system that handles steering and braking at speeds of up to 40 miles. The system requires the driver to check in with the steering wheel every 15 seconds. Audi said the system will beep alerts at the driver, and if the driver does not respond, it will bring the vehicle to a stop. FILE PHOTO - New Autopilot features are demonstrated in a Tesla Model S during a Tesla event in Palo Alto, California October 14, 2015.Beck Diefenbach/File PhotoThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which is the lead agency for regulating self-driving cars, does not test or preapprove driver assistance systems before automakers install them. Instead, the agency responds to complaints or crashes when it investigates whether a potential defect poses an unreasonable risk to driver safety. The May 2016 Tesla accident has raised concerns about the regulation of self-driving cars. The NTSB will issue probable cause findings and may make recommendations to the NHTSA in the Tesla crash but does not plan to hold a public hearing on the incident, spokesman Keith Holloway said.      FILE PHOTO: A Tesla Model X is photographed alongside a Model S at a Tesla electric car dealership in Sydney, Australia, May 31, 2017.Jason Reed/File PhotoIn September 2016, Tesla unveiled new restrictions on Autopilot after widespread concerns the system lulled users into a false sense of security through its  hands-off  driving capability.    The updated system temporarily prevents drivers from using the system if they do not respond to audible warnings to take back control of the car. The car sounds warnings if drivers take their hands off the wheel for more than a minute at speeds above 45 miles per hour (72 kph) when there is no vehicle ahead, Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk told reporters in September. If the driver ignores three audible warnings in an hour, the system temporarily shuts off until it is parked. Musk said at the time that autopilot accidents are far more likely for expert users of the system, saying some users got as many as 10 warnings in an hour under the prior system. “It's not the neophytes, it's the experts. They get very comfortable with it and repeatedly ignore the car's warnings and in effect it becomes like a reflex action,” Musk said. Tesla monitors drivers through their interactions with the steering wheel, turn signal, and speed setting, NHTSA said in a separate report. Alphabet Inc's (GOOG.O) Waymo unit, which is also working on self-driving technology, is taking a different approach, arguing that asking drivers to pay attention while the car drives itself is wrong. Waymo is focusing its efforts on fully autonomous vehicles where humans take no part in driving, rather driver assistance.     We're not seeking to build a better car. Our goal is to build a better driver,  Waymo Chief Executive Officer John Krafcik said earlier this year.

After opening with a superb 63, Spieth could manage only a pedestrian one-under-par 69 at TPC River Highlands in Cromwell. “For an off day, to shoot one-under, hopefully that’s the high score for this week,” he told Golf Channel after posting an eight-under 132 total, one stroke ahead of fellow Americans Patrick Reed and Troy Merritt. Former world number one Spieth missed a couple of short putts in a round marred by two dropped shots at the par-five 13th where his drive sailed out-of-bounds, but he also had his high moments, including a 35-foot birdie at the third. “I made a double on a birdie hole and that throws you back a few shots but rebounded nicely,” he said. “The mid-range game I’m feeling a little bit better about (but) I’ve got to put some more work in.” Reed, a team-mate of Spieth's at the past two Ryder Cups, moved within a shot of the leader with a 13-foot birdie at the final hole in a testing afternoon breeze. “Hardest I’ve seen the golf course play in the past couple of years,” said Reed, a five-time PGA Tour winner who is coming off a tie for 13th at last week’s U.S. Open.

Mandatory Credit: Bill Streicher-USA TODAY SportsThe cut fell at even-par 140, with Rory McIlroy making it on the number after bogeying the final hole, where his approach shot came up short of the green after his back foot slipped during his downswing. Another former world number one, Jason Day, bowed out, missing the cut by two strokes after signing for a score one stroke higher than he actually shot. He birdied the third hole, but marked down a par on his card. A player is not disqualified for signing for a higher score, but nor is he allowed to rectify the mistake once he puts his signature on the card. In this case it was merely academic, because Day would have missed the cut anyway. Day also missed the cut at the U.S. Open.

In an update to awards announced in January by former President Barack Obama's administration, the department released a new list of grant recipients and amounts, shifting money to law enforcement offices and away from groups that combat U.S.-based extremism. Reuters reported in February that President Donald Trump's administration wanted to revamp the program to focus solely on Islamist extremism. A DHS spokeswoman said the department changed the grant criteria after the release of the initial list to consider whether applicants would partner with law enforcement, had experience implementing counter-extremism prevention programs, and would be able to continue after the awards were spent.  Top-scoring applications that were consistent with these priorities remained as awardees, while others did not,  said DHS spokeswoman Lucy Martinez. Three local law enforcement offices in California, Washington state and Minnesota were among the new awardees, receiving grants totaling $1.2 million. A spokesman for the Alameda County Sheriff's Office in California said it would use the money to address extremism  on all fronts,  not just Islamist violence. Sergeant Ray Kelly cited violent clashes between right-wing and left-wing demonstrators that recently erupted in the city of Berkeley as an example of local extremism in the county. Kelly said the office would use the grant money to train officers to better recognize and address signs of alienation that make young people vulnerable to extremism, with the help of behavioral health counselors who are already on staff. The Muslim Public Affairs Council, a nonprofit group that works to improve public understanding and policies that affect American Muslims, said the Trump administration revoked its nearly $400,000 grant because the group  did not meet the criteria of working with law enforcement to counter violent extremism.  The revised list also omitted several original awardees focused on U.S.-based extremism, such as Life After Hate, which tries to steer young people away from far-right extremism. Christian Picciolini, a co-founder of Life After Hate, told Reuters his group was planning to use its $400,000 grant to scale up its counselor network of former extremists to  meet the highly increased requests for our services since Election Day.   The current administration's lack of focus on domestic white extremist terrorism, let alone its denial to even acknowledge it exists, is highly troubling,  Picciolini wrote in an email.

The FTC, along with the attorneys general of California and the District of Columbia, will file a complaint in federal district court seeking a preliminary injunction to block the deal, the antitrust regulator said. The companies said in a joint statement that they were considering their legal options.  We are disappointed by this decision and continue to believe that a merger is in the best interests of our players, our companies, our employees and the fantasy sports industry,  DraftKings Chief Executive Jason Robins and his FanDuel counterpart, Nigel Eccles, said in the statement. This is the latest setback for two companies, which have faced regulatory challenges in several states. They announced the deal in November 2016 as a merger of equals that would cut their legal bills. Between them, the two companies have 95 percent of daily fantasy sports, according to data from Eilers and Krejcik Gaming LLC. DraftKings and FanDuel have argued that they compete against larger, more powerful companies in the broader fantasy sports business, like ESPN and Yahoo.  This merger would deprive customers of the substantial benefits of direct competition between DraftKings and FanDuel,  said Tad Lipsky, acting director of the FTC’s Bureau of Competition. The FTC will ask for the preliminary injunction to prevent the companies from closing the deal while it proceeds with an internal review to determine if the merger is legal under antitrust law. In practice, if companies are slapped with a preliminary injunction, they normally terminate a merger because deals cannot be held together during the lengthy internal process. The FTC has won a long list of court fights to stop deals of all sizes in recent years. Most notably, the agency stopped food distribution giant Sysco Corp from buying US Foods Inc and prevented office supplies retailer Staples Inc from buying Office Depot Inc. Modern fantasy sports started in 1980 and have mushroomed online. Participants typically create teams that span an entire season in professional sports, including American football, baseball, basketball and hockey. Daily fantasy sports, a turbocharged version of the season-long game, have developed over the past decade into a multibillion-dollar industry. Participants draft teams for a single game, enabling fans to spend money on contests with a frequency critics compare to sports betting. FanDuel has paid contests in 39 states while DraftKings is in 40 where successful players win money. The companies have a history of aggressive advertising as they have battled for market share. They cut ad spending significantly in 2016 and said the combined company could again expand spending on advertising and customer acquisition. The tie-up would reduce costs as both companies separately fund legal defenses and lobbying for legislation to authorize fantasy sports in states that have declared it illegal. Without a merger, the companies may have to go back to outspending each other to win customers. New York's Eric Schneiderman was one of several state attorneys general who cracked down on the industry in 2015. New York settled for $12 million and changes in how the companies market their games, including disclosures about expected winnings. FanDuel's investors include Shamrock Capital, Comcast Ventures, NBC Sports and Google Capital. DraftKings' investors include KKR and others.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/fanduel-ma-draftkings-idUSL1N1JI1QG"},

Modern fantasy sports started in 1980 and have mushroomed online. Participants typically create teams that span an entire season in professional sports, including American football, baseball, basketball and hockey. Daily fantasy sports, a turbocharged version of the season-long game, have developed over the past decade into a multibillion-dollar industry. Participants draft teams for a single game, enabling fans to spend money on contests with a frequency critics compare to sports betting. FanDuel has paid contests in 39 states while DraftKings is in 40 where successful players win money. The companies have a history of aggressive advertising as they have battled for market share. They cut ad spending significantly in 2016 and said the combined company could again expand spending on advertising and customer acquisition. The tie-up would reduce costs as both companies separately fund legal defenses and lobbying for legislation to authorize fantasy sports in states that have declared it illegal. Without a merger, the companies may have to go back to outspending each other to win customers. New York's Eric Schneiderman was one of several state attorneys general who cracked down on the industry in 2015. New York settled for $12 million and changes in how the companies market their games, including disclosures about expected winnings. FanDuel's investors include Shamrock Capital, Comcast Ventures, NBC Sports and Google Capital. DraftKings' investors include KKR and others.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/fanduel-ma-draftkings-idUSL1N1JL00L"},

Under Brazilian law, any criminal charges against a sitting president must be approved by two-thirds of the lower house of Congress in order for the Supreme Court to put a leader on trial. Top prosecutor Rodrigo Janot is expected to charge Temer with receiving bribes early next week. The president is also facing accusations of racketeering and obstruction of justice.  Temer's office and his attorney, Antonio Mariz, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Temer has repeatedly said he is innocent of all accusations. The investigation is hampering the president's ability to push his economic reforms through Congress.  Key lawmakers in Temer's alliance told Reuters this week, on condition of anonymity so they could speak freely, that they will set aside work on those proposed labor law reforms if forced to vote on criminal charges against Temer.  They also said they will not even consider advancing work on pension reforms until changes to the labor law are passed. Temer is being investigated in connection with a political graft scheme involving JBS SA, the world's largest meatpacker. Company executives said in plea-bargain testimony that the president took nearly $5 million in bribes in return for help resolving tax matters, for freeing up loans from state-run banks and other matters.  Joesley Batista, one of the brothers who control JBS, also made a recording of a conversation he had with Temer earlier this year. In it the president appears to condone paying off a potential witness. Batista also accused Temer and aides of negotiating millions of dollars in illegal campaign donations for his Brazilian Social Democracy Party. Lawyers defending Temer were trying to dismiss the use of the recording in the investigation, saying it was manipulated. But police said on Friday after finishing an analysis of the audio files and the equipment used by Joesley Batista to record the president that they were valid. Lawmakers in Temer's alliance say they have the one-third of lower-house votes required to block any charges against Temer. Out of 513 deputies, leaders in the alliance said this week they have between 250 and 300 votes.   But they also told Reuters they widely expected Janot to use the strategy of dragging out the charges against Temer in an effort to wear down lawmakers with multiple votes.  Those ballots will be deeply unpopular with Brazilian voters who overwhelmingly believe Temer is corrupt, according to opinion polls. It also gives more time for possible new corruption revelations to surface against Temer, said another key lawmaker speaking on condition of anonymity, potentially eroding his support in the house.

Russian authorities are asking Western tech companies to allow them to review source code for security products such as firewalls, anti-virus applications and software containing encryption before permitting the products to be imported and sold in the country. The requests, which have increased since 2014, are ostensibly done to ensure foreign spy agencies have not hidden any  backdoors  that would allow them to burrow into Russian systems.  But those inspections also provide the Russians an opportunity to find vulnerabilities in the products' source code - instructions that control the basic operations of computer equipment - current and former U.S. officials and security experts said.  REUTERS CYBER RISK COVERAGEExclusive: Fake online stores reveal gamblers' shadow banking system Russians targeted 21 election systems, U.S. official saysNew Girl Scout badges focus on cyber crime, not cookie sales While a number of U.S. firms say they are playing ball to preserve their entree to Russia's huge tech market, at least one U.S. firm, Symantec, told Reuters it has stopped cooperating with the source code reviews over security concerns. That halt has not been previously reported.  Symantec said one of the labs inspecting its products was not independent enough from the Russian government.  U.S. officials say they have warned firms about the risks of allowing the Russians to review their products' source code, because of fears it could be used in cyber attacks. But they say they have no legal authority to stop the practice unless the technology has restricted military applications or violates U.S. sanctions.  From their side, companies say they are under pressure to acquiesce to the demands from Russian regulators or risk being shut out of a lucrative market. The companies say they only allow Russia to review their source code in secure facilities that prevent code from being copied or altered. (Graphic on source code review process: tmsnrt.rs/2sZudWT)  The demands are being made by Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB), which the U.S. government says took part in the cyber attacks on Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign and the 2014 hack of 500 million Yahoo email accounts. The FSB, which has denied involvement in both the election and Yahoo hacks, doubles as a regulator charged with approving the sale of sophisticated technology products in Russia.  The reviews are also conducted by the Federal Service for Technical and Export Control (FSTEC), a Russian defense agency tasked with countering cyber espionage and protecting state secrets. Records published by FSTEC and reviewed by Reuters show that from 1996 to 2013, it conducted source code reviews as part of approvals for 13 technology products from Western companies. In the past three years alone it carried out 28 reviews.  A Kremlin spokesman referred all questions to the FSB. The FSB did not respond to requests for comment. FSTEC said in a statement that its reviews were in line with international practice. The U.S. State Department declined to comment.  Moscow's source code requests have mushroomed in scope since U.S.-Russia relations went into a tailspin following the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014, according to eight current and former U.S. officials, four company executives, three U.S. trade attorneys and Russian regulatory documents.  In addition to IBM, Cisco and Germany's SAP, Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co and McAfee have also allowed Russia to conduct source code reviews of their products, according to people familiar with the companies' interactions with Moscow and Russian regulatory records.  Until now, little has been known about that regulatory review process outside of the industry. The FSTEC documents and interviews with those involved in the reviews provide a rare window into the tense push-and-pull between technology companies and governments in an era of mounting alarm about hacking.  Roszel Thomsen, an attorney who helps U.S. tech companies navigate Russia import laws, said the firms must balance the dangers of revealing source code to Russian security services against possible lost sales.   Some companies do refuse,  he said.  Others look at the potential market and take the risk.    We Have a Real Concern   If tech firms do decline the FSB's source code requests, then approval for their products can be indefinitely delayed or denied outright, U.S. trade attorneys and U.S. officials said. The Russian information technology market is expected to be worth $18.4 billion this year, according to market researcher International Data Corporation (IDC).  Six current and former U.S. officials who have dealt with companies on the issue said they are suspicious about Russia's motives for the expanded reviews.   It’s something we have a real concern about,  said a former senior Commerce Department official who had direct knowledge of the interaction between U.S. companies and Russian officials until he left office this year.  You have to ask yourself what it is they are trying to do, and clearly they are trying to look for information they can use to their advantage to exploit, and that’s obviously a real problem.   However, none of the officials who spoke to Reuters could point to specific examples of hacks or cyber espionage that were made possible by the review process.  Source code requests are not unique to Russia. In the United States, tech companies allow the government to audit source code in limited instances as part of defense contracts and other sensitive government work. China sometimes also requires source code reviews as a condition to import commercial software, U.S. trade attorneys say.  An exterior view shows a building, which houses the office of technology testing company Echelon, in Moscow, Russia June 18, 2017.Sergei Karpukhin Clean Rooms   The reviews often takes place in secure facilities known as  clean rooms.  Several of the Russian companies that conduct the testing for Western tech companies on behalf of Russian regulators have current or previous links to the Russian military, according to their websites.  Echelon, a Moscow-based technology testing company, is one of several independent FSB-accredited testing centers that Western companies can hire to help obtain FSB approval for their products.  Echelon CEO Alexey Markov told Reuters his engineers review source code in special laboratories, controlled by the companies, where no software data can be altered or transferred.    Markov said Echelon is a private and independent company but does have a business relationship with Russia’s military and law enforcement authorities.  Echelon’s website touts medals it was awarded in 2013 by Russia’s Ministry of Defense for  protection of state secrets.  The company’s website also sometimes refers to Markov as the  Head of Attestation Center of the Ministry of Defense.   In an email, Markov said that title is only intended to convey Echelon’s role as a certified outside tester of military technology testing. The medals were generic and insignificant, he said.  Slideshow (2 Images)But for Symantec, the lab  didn't meet our bar  for independence, said spokeswoman Kristen Batch.  “In the case of Russia, we decided the protection of our customer base through the deployment of uncompromised security products was more important than pursuing an increase in market share in Russia,” said Batch, who added that the company did not believe Russia had tried to hack into its products.  In 2016, the company decided it would no longer use third parties, including Echelon, that have ties to a foreign state or get most of their revenue from government-mandated security testing.   It poses a risk to the integrity of our products that we are not willing to accept,  she said.  Without the source code approval, Symantec can no longer get approval to sell some of its business-oriented security products in Russia.  As a result, we do minimal business there,  she said.  Markov declined to comment on Symantec’s decision, citing a non-disclosure agreement with the company.  Trusted Labs  Over the past year, HP has used Echelon to allow FSTEC to review source code, according to the agency's records. A company spokesman declined to comment.        An IBM spokesman confirmed the company allows Russia to review its source code in secure, company-controlled facilities  where strict procedures are followed.   FSTEC certification records showed the Information Security Center, an independent testing company based outside Moscow, has reviewed IBM’s source code on behalf of the agency. The company was founded more than 20 years ago under the auspices of an institute within Russia’s Ministry of Defense, according to its website. The company did not respond to requests for comment.  In a statement, McAfee said the Russia code reviews were conducted  at  certified testing labs  at company-owned premises in the United States.  SAP allows Russia to review and test source code in a secure SAP facility in Germany, according to a person familiar with the process. In a company statement, SAP said the review process assures Russian customers “their SAP software investments are safe and secure.”  Cisco has recently allowed Russia to review source code, according to a person familiar with the matter.  A Cisco spokeswoman declined to comment on the company's interactions with Russian authorities but said the firm does sometimes allow regulators to inspect small parts of its code in  trusted  independent labs and that the reviews do not compromise the security of its products.  Before allowing the reviews, Cisco scrutinizes the code to ensure they are not exposing vulnerabilities that could be used to hack the products, she said.

Officials in Canada and the European Union also said they had rejected some shipments of Brazilian beef in recent months. Brazil's government and meat industry said most problems stemmed from vaccinations and were being addressed. The U.S. Department of Agriculture described repeated import violations involving raw beef from seven Brazilian facilities,  indicating a  system-wide problem,  according to a letter seen by Reuters on Friday explaining the reason for Thursday's ban. While fresh beef shipments to the United States represent only 1 percent Brazil's beef exports, the ban there and scrutiny elsewhere threatens to tarnish the country's powerhouse protein industry, which has suffered a series of recent scandals.  If you look at the financial aspect, it's important for the country but the bigger damage is to our image,  said Antonio Camardelli, head of Brazilian meat exporters association Abiec. He said USDA approval for Brazil's fresh beef, which was only granted last year, was expected to open the door to bigger fresh beef importers such as Japan and South Korea.  We worked a long time to open the U.S. market because it's a passport to other markets,  Camardelli said. Brazil Deputy Agriculture Minister Eumar Novacki said the problems laid out by the USDA posed no risk to public health. Novacki told reporters at a news conference that some cattle had adverse reactions to certain vaccines. Related CoverageBrazilian restaurants in U.S. not bothered by beef banAmong the violations the USDA detected were abscesses, unidentified foreign material and  ingesta,  which can include any food, drink or medicine that cattle consume. Brazilian beef exports to the United States from companies including Marfrig Global Foods SA and Minerva SA also have been missing shipping marks and had labeling problems on containers, according to USDA data. Novacki recognized there were flaws in Brazil's inspection system but suggested there could be  commercial motivations  for the U.S. ban. He said U.S. and European authorities had stepped up inspections of Brazilian beef in recent months. Since March, the USDA has rejected 11 percent of Brazilian fresh beef products, compared to the rejection rate of 1 percent for shipments from the rest of the world. The shipments, totaling about 1.9 million pounds, raised concerns about public health, animal health and sanitation, the USDA said. FILE PHOTO: A man cools cattle on a beached boat in the Amazon river, in the city of Manaus, Brazil, October 26, 2015.Bruno Kelly/File photoCamardelli said about 120 containers with some 3,000 tonnes of Brazilian meat currently are at sea headed to the United States. European and Canadian officials also described issues found in inspections of imported Brazilian beef.    The EU said it had rejected some shipments of Brazilian beef due to the presence of Shiga toxin-producing E. coli. Some Brazilian poultry shipments were refused because of salmonella. Canada has rejected six shipments of Brazilian beef out of 191 meat shipments since April 10, according to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency. Cattle walk on a tract of Amazon rainforest that has been cleared by loggers and farmers near the city of Novo Progresso, Para State, Brazil, July 2, 2013.Nacho DoceThe Canadian agency said it recently blocked imports from one JBS SA plant in Brazil that did not meet food safety requirements, but is accepting meat from plants that meet its standards. Novacki said Brazil was working with European officials to allay concerns and declined to comment on issues in Canada. The problems, detailed by representatives in response to questions by Reuters, illustrate that Brazil meat industry is still under a cloud of scrutiny. Three months ago, Brazilian meatpackers were hit with a scandal involving alleged bribery of health officials, which briefly shut Brazil's protein exports out of major global markets from China to Europe. Shares of JBS and Marfrig fell about 1 percent in Sao Paulo. Marfrig said beef exports from Brazil to the U.S. market have contributed less than 1 percent of its revenue this year. JBS declined to comment on the matter.  Minerva, whose shares were up slightly, said it would ship fresh beef to the U.S. market from Uruguay rather than Brazil, adding that the change would not affect its export volumes.

North Korea's foreign ministry spokesman said Warmbier was  a victim of the policy of strategic patience  of former U.S. President Barack Obama whose government never requested his release, according to comments carried by the official KCNA agency.  The fact that Warmbier died suddenly in less than a week just after his return to the U.S. ... is a mystery to us as well,  KCNA quoted the spokesman as saying. Warmbier, 22, was arrested while visiting the reclusive country as a tourist. He was sentenced to 15 years of hard labor for trying to steal an item bearing a propaganda slogan from his hotel, North Korean state media said. He was sent home last week suffering from brain damage and in what U.S. doctors called a state of unresponsive wakefulness. He died on Monday.  Katina Adams, a spokeswoman for the U.S. State Department’s East Asia Bureau, said Washington had repeatedly requested the release of Warmbier under the Obama administration. A former senior State Department official said the United States had made repeated requests for Warmbier's release on humanitarian grounds under Obama, including via the North Korean mission at the United Nations, via the Swedish mission in Pyongyang, at unofficial talks with North Korean officials involving former U.S. officials, and via third parties. Warmbier's death fanned a conflict between the North and the United States that was already aggravated by North Korea's defiant missile launches and two nuclear tests since early last year as part of its effort to build a nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) capable of hitting the U.S. mainland. A U.S. official said on Thursday that North Korea had conducted another test of a rocket engine believed to be linked to Pyongyang's ICBM program.  Clearly a Criminal   Fred and Cindy Warmbier follow their son's, Otto Wambier, casket to the hearse after his funeral at Wyoming High School in Wyoming, Ohio, U.S. June 22, 2017.John Sommers IIU.S. President Donald Trump blamed  the brutality of the North Korean regime  for Warmbier's death. South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who had advocated talks with the North, said Pyongyang had a  heavy responsibility  in the events leading up to the University of Virginia student's death. The North's unnamed ministry spokesman said that such accusations were part of a smear campaign to slander the country that had given  medical treatments and care with all sincerity  to a person who was  clearly a criminal . U.S. doctors who traveled to the North last week to bring Warmbier home recognized that the North had provided him with medical treatment, the spokesman said.  To make it clear, we are the biggest victim of this incident.  FILE PHOTO: A person believed to be Otto Warmbier is transferred from a medical transport airplane to an awaiting ambulance at Lunken Airport in Cincinnati, Ohio, U.S., June 13, 2017.Bryan Woolston/File PhotoNorth Korea accepted repeated requests from the present U.S. administration, the spokesman said, and repatriated the student on humanitarian grounds  in consideration of his bad health.  The exact cause of Warmbier's death remains unclear. Officials at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center, where he was treated after his return, declined to provide details. His family asked the local coroner not to perform an autopsy. Thousands of friends and relatives gathered at Wyoming High School in suburban Cincinnati on Thursday for a memorial service for Warmbier, who graduated from the school as salutatorian in 2013. After returning from a five-day trip to North Korea on June 17, former National Basketball Association star Dennis Rodman suggested on Friday that his visit may have had something to do with Pyongyang's decision to send the student home. Rodman, who has faced ridicule and criticism for visiting North Korea in the past, has said he was trying to bring sports to the increasingly isolated country.  I was just so happy to see the kid released,  Rodman told ABC News in an interview.  Some good things came of this trip.    The United States has demanded North Korea release three other U.S. citizens it holds in detention: missionary Kim Dong Chul and academics Tony Kim and Kim Hak Song.

The e-commerce giant would need to add a large network of specialized grocery distribution warehouses, former AmazonFresh employees and logistics experts said. This is something Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) and other competitors have already done. Whole Foods, with a relatively small distribution footprint of its own, does little to change the picture for Amazon, they said. Amazon has a little more than 3 million square feet of U.S. warehousing dedicated to its existing AmazonFresh and Prime Pantry grocery programs - a tenth of the warehouse space Wal-Mart has for specialized food distribution, according to logistics consulting firm MWPVL International Inc.  AmazonFresh really was for lack of a better word an after-thought,  said Brittain Ladd, who until March was a senior manager for the grocery delivery program, which launched in 2007. One key to Amazon's success in general retail sales has been its speed in delivering products to consumers, facilitated by warehouses located strategically throughout the United States. As of 2016, the company had about 100 million square feet of space in its fulfillment and data centers, some of it outfitted with state-of-the-art robotics to boost efficiency. Facilities for distributing fresh food are far more complicated than ordinary warehouses. A single facility can need a half dozen or more temperature settings to house products from Popsicles to berries. Some require certification from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and extra care must be taken to keep shelves clean and prevent pests from contaminating food. Whole Foods has over 1 million square feet of warehouse space for distribution to its markets, and a chunk of its inventory goes straight from suppliers to stores, MWPVL said.  The logo of Amazon is seen at the company logistics center in Lauwin-Planque, northern France, February 20, 2017.Pascal Rossignol It's a peanut. It's nothing,  MWPVL President Marc Wulfraat said of Whole Foods' distribution.  If Amazon wants to become a dominant grocery company in a short period of time, then there would be an investment required, and it would be big.  Amazon, which did not return requests for comment, has not detailed its plans for Whole Foods. 12 or More Grocery Warehouses Needed Amazon's fulfillment expenses jumped 31 percent in 2016 - a bit faster than in prior years and faster than its retail sales growth - to $17.6 billion, according to its annual regulatory filing. Industry experts estimate the company would have to add a dozen or more grocery warehouses, particularly if it wanted to supply Whole Food stores in addition to homes. The cost to do that is unclear. They said Amazon would likely continue to rely on United Natural Foods Inc (UNFI.O) to supply Whole Foods with hard-to-source products, but would probably aim to cut costs and handle more of the distribution for conventional items. Even using Whole Foods stores to provide food for delivering  to nearby urban shoppers would have hard limits, since many outlets lack the floor space to handle thousands of online orders.  It’s a space issue for stuff coming through. It’s a labor issue for people tripping over each other,  said Tom Furphy, former vice president of consumables and AmazonFresh, and now chief executive of Consumer Equity Partners. There would also be a risk that  the quality starts to go down because the e-commerce orders are getting better product.

Officer Ray Tensing shot once, hitting 43-year-old Samuel DuBose in the head after stopping him for a missing front license plate on his car in July 2015, a body camera worn by Tensing showed. Tensing, 27, was charged with murder and voluntary manslaughter in a retrial of the case. A mistrial was declared last November after jurors could not agree on a verdict. Tensing has said in both trials that he feared for his life during the traffic stop.  DuBose's shooting added to the debate in the United States over the use of excessive force by police, especially against minorities. The mistrial was called one week after a police officer in Minnesota was acquitted of killing a black motorist and two days after a former Milwaukee cop was found not guilty of reckless homicide in the fatal shooting of a black man during a foot chase.   At this time, this court is in a position and will have to, as a result of the jury being unable to reach a verdict, declare a mistrial in this case,  Judge Leslie Ghiz said after jurors at the Hamilton County Common Pleas Court in Cincinnati said they were hopelessly deadlocked for a second time Friday.   Friday's mistrial came after more than 30 hours of deliberations, which started on Monday. Former University of Cincinnati police officer Ray Tensing walks out of the courtroom after the judge declares a mistrial after jury deadlocks ending the retrial in the death of Samuel DuBose in Cincinnati, Ohio, U.S. June 23, 2017.William PhilpottAudrey DuBose, Samuel DuBose's mother, demanded a retrial immediately after the mistrial was declared and called for  peaceful protest of what she called  this unjust result.   We are outraged that a second jury has now failed to convict Ray Tensing,  she said in a statement.  We demand another retrial.  Slideshow (7 Images)Hamilton County Prosecuting Attorney Joe Deters would not comment until early next week, a spokeswoman said. Stew Mathews, Tensing's attorney, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  As I have said many times before, I do not believe that Sam DuBose should have been killed in that situation,  Mayor John Cranley told reporters.  Tensing has been free on a $1 million bond. The university police fired him after he was charged. During the traffic stop, Tensing asked DuBose to remove his seat belt and tried to open the car door. DuBose did not comply and closed the door. The vehicle started slowly rolling forward with Tensing's arm pinned against the steering wheel, his lawyer said. Tensing pulled his gun and fired once. In the latest trial, prosecutors said Tensing ignored his training when he reached into the car, and that he was never in danger.

Five Republican senators have announced they will not support the bill, which is designed to repeal and replace Obamacare, in its current form. White House officials said on Friday that Trump has been in touch with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and made calls on Thursday and Friday to other lawmakers. Trump's role is expected to become more pronounced in coming days as the vote nears. Senate Republican leaders may rely on the deal-making former businessman to lean on conservative senators who are balking at the bill.  We're pleasantly surprised with a lot of the support that's already come out and I think we'll continue to work through (it,) in particular the four individuals who have expressed some ideas and concerns,  White House spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters at a White House briefing. With all Democrats expected to oppose the measure, the Republicans can afford to lose the support of only two of their 52 members if they want to pass the legislation. After Spicer spoke, Republican Senator Dean Heller became the fifth Republican opponent on Friday, saying he would not support the bill in its current form.  This bill that's currently in front of the United States Senate is not the answer,  Heller, a moderate who is up for re-election in 2018, said at a news conference in Las Vegas. That could add Heller's name to Trump's call list. A White House official said the Trump has pushed his team to stay involved and plans to flex his negotiating muscle, the official said. Healthcare stocks closed down 0.1 percent on Friday, clawing back some losses after the sector dropped sharply late in the session on Heller's announcement. The Senate's 142-page proposal, worked out in secret by a group led by McConnell, aims to deliver on a central Trump campaign promise to undo former President Barack Obama's signature healthcare law, which has provided coverage to 20 million Americans since it was passed in 2010. Republicans view the law, formally known as the Affordable Care Act, as a costly government intrusion and say individual insurance markets created by it are collapsing. Four Conservatives Oppose Bill On Thursday, four of the Senate's most conservative members said the new plan failed to rein in the federal government's role. Rand Paul, who has rejected the plan along with fellow Republican Senators Ted Cruz, Mike Lee and Ron Johnson, said fundamental problems remained that would leave taxpayers subsidizing health insurance companies. Trump, in an interview with Fox News that aired on Friday morning, called the group of conservative lawmakers  four very good people.   It's not that they're opposed,  he said.  They'd like to get certain changes. And we'll see if we can take care of that.  Trump said getting approval would require traveling a  very, very narrow path  but that  I think we're going to get there.   It's going to be a good bill,  Trump said in a separate Fox News interview to air on Sunday. For the House of Representatives's version of healthcare, Trump held regular meetings with representatives at the White House. He celebrated the bill's narrow passage last month in a Rose Garden event with House Republican leaders. Trump later criticized the House bill privately as  mean  and this week called for a health plan  with heart.  He indicated the Senate plan met that request. McConnell said in an interview with Reuters last month that he told Trump early on in the process that he did not need his help but that there may be a role for him later. The Senate bill maintains much of the structure of the House's but differs in key ways. It would phase out Obamacare's expansion of the Medicaid program for the poor more gradually, waiting until after the 2020 presidential election, but would enact deeper cuts starting in 2025. It also would provide more generous tax subsidies than the House bill to help low-income people buy private insurance.

White House spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters that while Trump  retains the authority  to dismiss special counsel Robert Mueller,  he has no intention of doing that.  Trump voiced concern in a TV interview on Fox News on Friday about what he said was the close relationship between former FBI Director James Comey and Mueller, who was named to take over the Russia investigation after Trump fired Comey.  He's very, very good friends with Comey, which is bothersome,  Trump told Fox News.  Look, there has been no obstruction. There has been no collusion. There has been leaking by Comey.  Lawmakers investigating allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election have raised questions about whether Comey's May 9 firing was an attempt by Trump to stop the Russia probe. While White House officials have said the firing was due to concerns about Comey's actions at the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Trump told an interviewer the Russia investigation was one of his concerns in taking the action.

There's been no collusion, no obstruction and virtually everybody agrees to that,  Trump told Fox, adding that Mueller  is an honorable man and hopefully he'll come up with an honorable solution.  Russia denies it meddled in the U.S. presidential election. In excerpts from a separate interview, Trump criticized President Barack Obama for inaction in the face of Russian meddling.   Well I just heard today for the first time that Obama knew about Russia a long time before the election, and he did nothing about it,  Trump said, according to excerpts from a Fox News interview to be broadcast on Sunday.  In congressional testimony on Wednesday, Jeh Johnson, who headed the Homeland Security Department under Obama, said his department had warned about hacking into voter databases. When asked why the Obama administration did not do more to warn the public, he said:  We were very concerned that we would not be perceived as taking sides in the election, injecting ourselves into a very heated campaign.

Brazil is the world's largest meat exporter but business has been marred by scandal and safety concerns and on Thursday the United States barred imports from there. The ban will not be an issue for American diners hungry for Brazilian dishes such as picanha, a famous cut from a cow's rump.  It doesn't even come close to beef from Colorado,  Joao de Matos, one of the owners of top-notch Brazilian steakhouse Churrascaria Plataforma in New York City, said of his homeland's beef in a telephone interview. De Matos also buys meat from Texas, the biggest cattle producing state, and said he probably would not buy from Brazil even if the ban is lifted.  Our supplier is the same that we had for 21 years,  de Matos said.  He doesn't even know what Brazilian beef is.  In Chicago, the historic center of the massive U.S. meat packing industry, managers of restaurants such as Carnivale and Zed451 said their themes may be Brazilian but the beef isn't.  We try to use local vendors but several chefs' recipes are specific to Brazilian regions,  said an employee at Carnivale.  And we do have a couple of meats that come from Australia.  Brazilian steakhouse chain Fogo de Chao has more than two dozen restaurants across the United States, as well as nine in Brazil. None of the meat used at their U.S. restaurants comes from Brazil, Mary Nelson, a spokeswoman for the chain, said in an email. A little over 7,000 metric tons of fresh beef has been imported to the United States from Brazil so far in 2017, said Eric Mittenthal, spokesman for trade association the North American Meat Institute. That is a tiny fraction of total U.S. meat consumption, he added.

Franzese has been in and out of prison for much of his adult life, having been granted parole by the U.S. Bureau of Prisons at least six times, Newsday reported. He was most recently incarcerated, at the age of 93 in 2010, for a racketeering conspiracy involving the shakedown of New York strip clubs. Federal prison officials could not be reached immediately to confirm his release or details of his criminal record. Franzese was acquitted in several murder cases going back for decades, Newsday reported, but he was sentenced to 50 years in prison in 1967 for his involvement in a bank robbery conspiracy. He was released long before he completed the full term in that case.

The official spoke to reporters in advance of U.S. President Donald Trump's first meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday, a White House visit that will include one-on-one talks and a working dinner. Securing agreement on the purchase of 22 unarmed drones, worth more than $2 billion, is seen in New Delhi as a key test of defense ties that flourished under former President Barack Obama but have drifted under Trump, who has courted Asian rival China as he seeks Beijing's help to contain North Korea's nuclear program.  The U.S.-based company that makes the drones, General Atomics Aeronautical Systems Inc, said on Friday that the U.S.  government had approved the sale of a naval variant of the Predator drone to India. The senior White House official said any arms transfer would take into account the regional situation.   We want to avoid a situation that escalates the tension  between India and Pakistan, the official said. India and Pakistan should engage in direct talks and seek a normalization of ties, the official said.  Some of the defense systems we're talking about we don't believe impact Pakistan,  the official added. The Indian navy wants the surveillance drones, variants of the Predator drones, to keep watch over the Indian Ocean. The deal would be the first such purchase by a country that is not a member of North Atlantic Treaty Organization. India, a big buyer of U.S. arms that was recently named by Washington as a major defense ally, wants to protect its 7,500- km (4,700-mile) coastline as Beijing expands its maritime trade routes and Chinese submarines increasingly lurk in regional waters. But sources tracking the discussions say the U.S. State Department has been concerned about the potential destabilizing impact of introducing high-tech drones into South Asia, where tensions are simmering between India and Pakistan, particularly over Kashmir, which is divided between them. Such a sale of sensitive military hardware must be authorized by the State Department before being sent to Congress for review. The drone deal would still require approval by Congress. The State Department declined comment ahead of any notification. Defense cooperation, the U.S. trade deficit with India, counter-terrorism efforts and regional tensions are expected to be discussed between the two leaders.  Modi's two-day visit to Washington begins on Sunday. Trump met Chinese President Xi Jinping in April and has also had face time with the leaders of nations including Japan, Britain and Vietnam since taking office in January, prompting anxiety in New Delhi that India is no longer a priority in Washington. Other strains have emerged in U.S.-India relations, with the United States vexed by a growing bilateral trade deficit and Trump accusing New Delhi of negotiating unscrupulously at the Paris climate talks to walk away with billions in aid. U.S. officials expect a relatively low-key visit by Modi, without the fanfare of some of his previous trips to the United States, and one geared to giving the Indian leader the chance to get to know Trump personally and to show that he is doing so. India and the United States will also discuss the sale of U.S. fighter jets during Modi's trip, in what could be the biggest deal since they began deepening defense ties more than a decade ago.

But while the Northern Irishman eventually advanced to the weekend without a stroke to spare, another former world number one, Jason Day, headed home early for the second week in a row after signing for the wrong score. McIlroy and Day both missed the cut at the U.S. Open last week, so McIlroy was clearly relieved not to suffer the same fate as he tries to get some competitive rounds under his belt after recovering from an early-season rib injury. On the fairway at the par-four 18th, he had barely 100 yards to the hole, a wedge in his hand and birdie in his mind at TPC River Highlands. But his back foot slipped substantially during his downswing, causing him to hit the ball fat, advancing it barely halfway to the hole and leaving it in rough. The dropped shot left McIlroy sweating whether he would make the cut with his even-par 140 halfway total, but he ended up advancing to the weekend by the skin of his teeth, eight strokes behind halfway leader Jordan Spieth.

It was weird. As soon as I started down (on the downswing) I just felt it and I couldn’t stop. Not a very nice shot to finish with. “I hope I get two more rounds, more than anything to learn where my game’s at going into the next two weeks.” Australian Day, meanwhile, shot a 69 but signed for a 70 after marking a par on his card at the third hole, where he actually made birdie. Under the rules, a player is not disqualified for signing for a higher score than he shoots.  Day bogeyed the last and signed for a two-over 142 total, two strokes shy of making the cut.

The deal, announced Friday by lawyers for people whose information was compromised, must still be approved by U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose, California, who is presiding over the case. The money will be used to pay for two years of credit monitoring for people affected by the hack, the lawyers said. Victims are believed to include current and former customers of Anthem and of other insurers affiliated with Anthem through the national Blue Cross Blue Shield Association. People who are already enrolled in credit monitoring may choose to receive cash instead, which may be up to $50 per person, according to a motion filed in California federal court Friday.  We are very satisfied that the settlement is a great result for those affected and look forward to working through the settlement approval process,” Andrew Friedman, a lawyer for the victims, said in a statement. The credit monitoring in the settlement is in addition to the two years of credit monitoring Anthem offered victims when it announced the breach in February 2015, according to Anthem spokeswoman Jill Becher, who said the company was pleased to be resolving the litigation. The Indianapolis-based company did not admit wrongdoing, and there was no evidence any compromised information was sold or used to commit fraud, Becher said. Anthem said in February 2015 that an unknown hacker had accessed a database containing personal information, including names, birthdays, social security numbers, addresses, email addresses and employment and income information. The attack did not compromise credit card information or medical information, the company said. More than 100 lawsuits filed against Anthem over the breach were consolidated before Judge Koh. The breach is one of a series of high-profile data breaches that resulted in losses of hundreds of millions of dollars to U.S. companies in recent years, including Target Corp, which agreed to pay $18.5 million to settle claims by 47 states in May, and Home Depot Inc, which agreed to pay at least $19.5 million to consumers last year.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/anthem-cyber-settlement-idUSL1N1JK1WV"},

The preliminary injunction requires the Wisconsin Department of Corrections to reach an agreement on detainee treatment with the American Civil Liberties Union and the Juvenile Law Center, which in January sued the state over conditions at the Lincoln Hills School for Boys and the Copper Lake School for Girls. As many as 20 percent of detainees at the facilities are held in solitary confinement for all but one or two hours each day, the lawsuit alleged, and officers  repeatedly and excessively  use pepper spray and routinely handcuff detainees.  The state argued that the  restrictive housing  employed at the centers should not be considered solitary confinement, and that the use of pepper spray and restraints was not excessive, according to a brief filed by the defendants last month. U.S. District Judge James Peterson wrote in Friday's decision that the state should aim to limit isolation time to a maximum of five to seven days, reduce or eliminate the use of pepper spray, and only employ mechanical restraints when needed to ensure safety. Peterson added that allowing detainees only one hour outside a cell per day is  likely unconstitutional.  He ordered the parties in the lawsuit to agree within two weeks on how to improve conditions at the facilities, which share a campus in Irma in northeastern Wisconsin. The plaintiffs filed the motion asking for the preliminary injunction in April.  We felt the kids were in such harm that, even before the resolution of the lawsuit, we were asking the court to take immediate action,  said Jessica Feierman, attorney for the Juvenile Law Center. Wisconsin Department of Corrections spokesman Tristan Cook said in a statement on Friday that the department has been working to implement reforms at the centers and will use the two-week period to further that work. The facilities, which held 174 inmates as of last week, according to state documents, have been subject to scrutiny before. In 2015, the state's attorney's office and the FBI began investigating allegations about the facilities, including child neglect and sexual assault.

Two people with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters early talks had started on whether and how European countries could co-operate on a new sixth-generation fighter, which could involve a combination of manned and unmanned systems. Though complicated by Britain's decision to leave the European Union, business executives and politicians at the Paris Airshow this week said U.S. President Donald Trump's cooler stance toward Europe had given the effort some fresh momentum.  But they warned of massive hurdles, including bickering among European states and companies, the troubled history of past joint projects such as the A400M military transport plane, and the sheer cost of developing advanced military aircraft. Any project is likely to cost far more than the 10 billion-plus euros sunk into the Eurofighter, the last joint fighter built, at a time when Europe is grappling with other expensive problems such as increased Islamist militancy and the influx of well over a million migrants from the Middle East and Africa. Yet EU politicians are determined to increase cooperation on defense and security in the face of a more assertive Russian military, and they are wary of effectively leaving the fighter jet market to the United States.   It's the same with food. Some things you have to be able to do yourself,  Monika Hohlmeier, a German member of the European Parliament and chair of the parliament's Sky & Space Intergroup, told Reuters during a visit to the A400M at the air show. Russia is also working on a new fighter jet that would be  smarter, faster,  and could fly further and higher, the head of its MiG aviation firm told Reuters on Friday. Germany, which has begun early work on a next-generation fighter, last month asked the United States for a classified briefing on the U.S. F-35 stealth fighter built by Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N), as it prepares for a more intense look at fighter options after the Sept. 24 election.   The F-35, which showed off its moves during its premiere at the Paris show, is being bought in Europe by Britain, Italy, the Netherlands, Denmark, Norway and Turkey. Belgium, Finland, Switzerland and Spain have also expressed interest. Buying the F-35 would help improve Germany's ability to fight with key allies, but could prove politically difficult in a country with strong labor unions eager to safeguard jobs. Corporate rivalries add another level of complexity. Corporate Battlelines  We are already working on the Next Generation Weapon System, which has been initiated by Germany but with strong interest from Spain and other nations, as part of a bigger concept of future combat systems including unmanned aircraft,  Fernando Alonso, head of military aircraft at Airbus (AIR.PA), told a briefing ahead of the Paris Airshow.

Airbus represents Germany and Spain in the maturing Eurofighter program, which also includes Britain through BAE Systems (BAES.L) and Italy via Leonardo (LDOF.MI). France, however, dropped out of that project early on due to disagreements over the sharing out of work, with its Dassault Aviation (DAST.PA) going on to develop the Rafale fighter jet. Airbus is pressing Dassault to join in this time instead of forcing Britain to choose a preferred continental partner. It is also unclear what role, if any, Sweden's SAAB (SAABb.ST) might play. SAAB builds the Gripen fighter, which is in use in Sweden, South Africa and Hungary, among others. One French diplomat said it was clear no one European nation could develop a new combat jet in the current environment.  Those days are over. Period,  the diplomat said. Even the United States' F-35 was developed with funds from Britain and other countries. Volker Thum, managing director of the German Aerospace Industries Association, said Franco-German cooperation was a  key driver for the urgently needed agreement  on the project. He said new President Emmanuel Macron's arrival at the air show on an A400M signaled his commitment to European cooperation. Airbus's Alonso said this month that upgrades and modernization would keep the Eurofighter flying into the 2040s, and possibly longer, but older warplanes like the pan-European Tornado and Spain's F/A-18s would soon need to be replaced, with buyers likely to want the latest technology and capabilities. Given the costs and timescale involved, aerospace analyst Richard Aboulafia said the need to get started on  an indigenous homegrown alternative to the F-35  was one of the biggest defense issues facing Europe.  But Brexit and disagreements among remaining EU members made him skeptical.  The odds are they probably won't get their act together,  he said, citing historical angst about military issues in Germany, Europe's largest economy, and Britain's increasing focus on U.S. ties.

The attack did not compromise credit card information or medical information, the company said. More than 100 lawsuits filed against Anthem over the breach were consolidated before Judge Koh. The breach is one of a series of high-profile data breaches that resulted in losses of hundreds of millions of dollars to U.S. companies in recent years, including Target Corp (TGT.N), which agreed to pay $18.5 million to settle claims by 47 states in May, and Home Depot Inc (HD.N), which agreed to pay at least $19.5 million to consumers last year.

Two people with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters early talks had started on whether and how European countries could co-operate on a new sixth-generation fighter, which could involve a combination of manned and unmanned systems. Though complicated by Britain's decision to leave the European Union, business executives and politicians at the Paris Airshow this week said U.S. President Donald Trump's cooler stance toward Europe had given the effort some fresh momentum.  But they warned of massive hurdles, including bickering among European states and companies, the troubled history of past joint projects such as the A400M military transport plane, and the sheer cost of developing advanced military aircraft. Any project is likely to cost far more than the 10 billion-plus euros sunk into the Eurofighter, the last joint fighter built, at a time when Europe is grappling with other expensive problems such as increased Islamist militancy and the influx of well over a million migrants from the Middle East and Africa. Yet EU politicians are determined to increase cooperation on defense and security in the face of a more assertive Russian military, and they are wary of effectively leaving the fighter jet market to the United States.   It's the same with food. Some things you have to be able to do yourself,  Monika Hohlmeier, a German member of the European Parliament and chair of the parliament's Sky & Space Intergroup, told Reuters during a visit to the A400M at the air show. Russia is also working on a new fighter jet that would be  smarter, faster,  and could fly further and higher, the head of its MiG aviation firm told Reuters on Friday. Germany, which has begun early work on a next-generation fighter, last month asked the United States for a classified briefing on the U.S. F-35 stealth fighter built by Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N), as it prepares for a more intense look at fighter options after the Sept. 24 election.   The F-35, which showed off its moves during its premiere at the Paris show, is being bought in Europe by Britain, Italy, the Netherlands, Denmark, Norway and Turkey. Belgium, Finland, Switzerland and Spain have also expressed interest. Buying the F-35 would help improve Germany's ability to fight with key allies, but could prove politically difficult in a country with strong labor unions eager to safeguard jobs. Corporate rivalries add another level of complexity. Corporate Battlelines  We are already working on the Next Generation Weapon System, which has been initiated by Germany but with strong interest from Spain and other nations, as part of a bigger concept of future combat systems including unmanned aircraft,  Fernando Alonso, head of military aircraft at Airbus (AIR.PA), told a briefing ahead of the Paris Airshow.   And I very much hope that we will see France involved in that because it is clearly very much in all our interest to see a common solution,  he added.

Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates have sent a 13-point list of demands apparently aimed at dismantling their tiny but wealthy neighbor's two-decade-old interventionist foreign policy which has incensed them. Kuwait is helping mediate the dispute. A Qatari government spokesman said Doha was reviewing the list of demands and that a formal response would be made by the foreign ministry and delivered to Kuwait, but added that the demands were not reasonable or actionable.  This list of demands confirms what Qatar has said from the beginning – the illegal blockade has nothing to do with combating terrorism, it is about limiting Qatar’s sovereignty, and outsourcing our foreign policy,  Sheikh Saif al-Thani director of Qatar's government communications office, said in a statement.  A Qatar semi-government human rights body said the demands  were a violation of human rights conventions and should not be accepted by Qatar. Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani had said on Monday that Qatar would not negotiate with the four states until economic, diplomatic and travel ties cut this month were restored. The countries that imposed the sanctions accuse Qatar of funding terrorism, fomenting regional unrest and drawing too close to their enemy Iran. Qatar rejects those accusations and says it is being punished for straying from its neighbors' backing for authoritarian hereditary and military rulers. The uncompromising demands leave little prospect for a quick end to the biggest diplomatic crisis for years between Sunni Arab Gulf states, regional analysts said.  The demands are so aggressive that it makes it close to impossible to currently see a resolution of that conflict,  said Olivier Jakob, a strategist at Switzerland-based oil consultancy Petromatrix.    Ibrahim Fraihat, Conflict Resolution Professor at the Doha Institute for Graduate Studies, forecast a prolonged stand-off. Qatar will reject the demands as a  non-starter , he said,  and its neighbors had already escalated as far as they were likely to go.  Military action remains unlikely at the moment so the outcome after the deadline would be a political stalemate ...  Washington, which is a close military ally of countries on both sides of the dispute, has called for a resolution. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Qatar's neighbors should make their demands  reasonable and actionable . Related CoverageQatar tries to reopen neighbors' skies at special U.N. hearing June 30Factbox: Arab states issue ultimatum to Qatar to meet list of demandsTen Days to Comply An official from one of the four nations, who gave details of the demands on condition of anonymity, told Reuters the offer would be  void  unless Qatar complied within 10 days. The UAE has said sanctions could last for years. Qatar, the world's richest country per capita, says the sanctions amount to a  blockade , but it has ample reserves to weather the storm.  The dispute is a big test for the United States, which has a large base in Qatar housing the headquarters of its Middle East air power and 11,000 troops. President Donald Trump has backed the sanctions, even as his Defense and State departments have tried to remain neutral, resulting in mixed signals. Trump called Qatar a  funder of terrorism at a very high level , only for his Pentagon to approve selling it $12 billion of warplanes five days later. The most powerful country in the region to back the Qatari side in the dispute has been Turkey, whose President Tayyip Erdogan has his roots in an Islamist political party similar to movements that Qatar has backed in the region. Days after the sanctions were imposed, Turkey rushed through legislation to send more troops to its base in Qatar as a sign of support. The Al Jazeera Media Network logo is seen on its headquarters building in Doha, Qatar June 8, 2017.Naseem Zeitoon - RTX39N4RDefence Minister Fikri Isik rejected the demand to close the base, saying it would represent interference in Ankara's relations with Doha. Instead, Turkey might bolster its presence.  Strengthening the Turkish base would be a positive step in terms of the Gulf's security,  he said.  Re-evaluating the base agreement with Qatar is not on our agenda.  Qatar has used its vast wealth over the past decade to exert influence abroad, backing factions in civil wars and revolts across the Middle East. It infuriated Egypt's present rulers and Saudi Arabia by backing a Muslim Brotherhood government in Cairo that ruled for a year until it was deposed by the army in 2013. Qatar's state-funded satellite broadcaster Al Jazeera became hugely popular across the Middle East, but has long infuriated Arab governments used to exercising firm control over the media in their countries. Jazeera hit back at the closure order, calling it  nothing but an attempt to silence the freedom of expression in the region . Stop Interfering The demands, handed to Qatar by mediator Kuwait, tell Qatar to stop interfering in the four nations' domestic and foreign affairs and refrain from giving Qatari nationality to their citizens, the official from one of the sanctioning states said. Slideshow (3 Images)They also include severing ties with the Muslim Brotherhood, Islamic State, al Qaeda, Hezbollah, and Jabhat Fateh al Sham, formerly al Qaeda's branch in Syria, and the surrender of all designated terrorists on Qatari territory. Qatar denies it has relationships with terrorist groups or shelters terrorists. It was ordered to scale down diplomatic relations with Iran, limit its commercial ties and expel members of Iran's Revolutionary Guards. Qatar denies they are there. The sanctioning countries demanded Qatar pay them reparations for any damage or costs incurred due to Qatari policies. Compliance with the demands would be monitored, with monthly reports in the first year, then every three months the next year, then annually for 10 years, the official said.  Although Reuters was told about the contents of the ultimatum by an official from one of the sanctioning countries, UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash accused Qatar of leaking the demands.  There is a price for the years of plotting and there is a price to return to the neighborhood,  Gargash said on Twitter.  The leak (of demands) seeks to derail mediation.  Qataris who spoke to Reuters described the demands as unreasonable, particularly the closure of Jazeera, which millions of Arabs see as an important outlet for voices willing to challenge the region's authoritarian rulers, but which neighboring governments call a conduit for Islamist propaganda.  Imagine another country demanding that CNN be closed,  40-year-old Haseeb Mansour, who works for telecom operator Ooredoo, said.  A Lot on the List  Abdullah al-Muhanadi, a retired public sector worker shopping for groceries in Doha on Friday morning, said the boycott must be lifted before negotiations to resolve the dispute could start.  There's a lot on the list that is simply not true or unreasonable, so how can we comply?  he said.  There are no IRGC (Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps) elements in Qatar and the agreement with Turkey is a long-standing diplomatic agreement so we cannot ask them to leave.  Qatar has only 300,000 citizens enjoying the riches produced by the world's largest exports of liquefied natural gas. The rest of its 2.7 million people are foreign migrant workers, mostly manual laborers employed on vast construction projects that have crowned the tiny desert peninsula with skyscrapers as well as stadiums for the 2022 soccer world cup. The sanctions have disrupted its main routes to import goods by land from Saudi Arabia and by sea from big container ships docked in the United Arab Emirates. But it so far has avoided economic collapse by quickly finding alternative routes, and it says its huge financial reserves will meet any challenges. Qatar says the sanctions have also brought personal hardship for its citizens who live in neighboring countries or have relatives there. The countries that imposed the sanctions gave Qataris two weeks to leave, which expired on Monday.

The Iowa Supreme Court ruled that state prosecutors waited beyond the three-year statute of limitations to bring charges against Eddie Tipton, a security expert with the Multi-State Lottery Association, which provides services to Iowa, Wisconsin and several other state lotteries. An Iowa jury convicted Tipton in 2015 of fraudulently passing or redeeming a lottery ticket, and tampering with lottery equipment to influence the drawing of the state's $16.5 million Hot Lotto jackpot in December 2010. The high court, however, dismissed the tampering conviction, rejecting state prosecutors' arguments that the violations were  continuing  offences that transcend legal time bars. It also vacated the fraud conviction and sent it back to the lower court. But Tipton has already pleaded guilty to separate felony charges in Wisconsin related to the high-tech rigging of software that affected that state's lottery.     The plea agreement, announced on June 12, also requires him to plead guilty to one count of ongoing criminal conduct in Iowa at a later date and to pay restitution to Colorado, Kansas and Oklahoma for similar fraudulent lottery wins. As a result, he faces 13-1/2 years in prison and a fine of $35,000 for theft by fraud and computer crime for programming lottery software resulting in him winning nearly $800,000, Wisconsin Attorney General Brad Schimel said. His sentencing is scheduled for Sept. 21. In 2007, Tipton programmed a modified code in the random number generator software that, when certain conditions were met, produced a predictable set of winning numbers, Schimel said. He then supplied these numbers to his friend, Robert Rhodes, who purchased a winning in Wisconsin Megabucks ticket worth $783,257 on Dec. 29, 2007. Rhodes and Tipton split the proceeds.

There is a price for the years of plotting and there is a price to return to the neighborhood,  Gargash said on Twitter.  The leak (of demands) seeks to derail mediation.  Qataris who spoke to Reuters described the demands as unreasonable, particularly the closure of Jazeera, which millions of Arabs see as an important outlet for voices willing to challenge the region's authoritarian rulers, but which neighboring governments call a conduit for Islamist propaganda.  Imagine another country demanding that CNN be closed,  40-year-old Haseeb Mansour, who works for telecom operator Ooredoo, said.  A Lot on the List  Abdullah al-Muhanadi, a retired public sector worker shopping for groceries in Doha on Friday morning, said the boycott must be lifted before negotiations to resolve the dispute could start.  There's a lot on the list that is simply not true or unreasonable, so how can we comply?  he said.  There are no IRGC (Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps) elements in Qatar and the agreement with Turkey is a long-standing diplomatic agreement so we cannot ask them to leave.  Qatar has only 300,000 citizens enjoying the riches produced by the world's largest exports of liquefied natural gas. The rest of its 2.7 million people are foreign migrant workers, mostly manual laborers employed on vast construction projects that have crowned the tiny desert peninsula with skyscrapers as well as stadiums for the 2022 soccer world cup. The sanctions have disrupted its main routes to import goods by land from Saudi Arabia and by sea from big container ships docked in the United Arab Emirates. But it so far has avoided economic collapse by quickly finding alternative routes, and it says its huge financial reserves will meet any challenges. Qatar says the sanctions have also brought personal hardship for its citizens who live in neighboring countries or have relatives there. The countries that imposed the sanctions gave Qataris two weeks to leave, which expired on Monday.

The Iowa Supreme Court ruled that state prosecutors waited beyond the three-year statute of limitations to bring charges against Eddie Tipton, a security expert with the Multi-State Lottery Association, which provides services to Iowa, Wisconsin and several other state lotteries. An Iowa jury convicted Tipton in 2015 of fraudulently passing or redeeming a lottery ticket, and tampering with lottery equipment to influence the drawing of the state's $16.5 million Hot Lotto jackpot in December 2010. The high court, however, dismissed the tampering conviction, rejecting state prosecutors' arguments that the violations were  continuing  offences that transcend legal time bars. It also vacated the fraud conviction and sent it back to the lower court. But Tipton has already pleaded guilty to separate felony charges in Wisconsin related to the high-tech rigging of software that affected that state's lottery. The plea agreement, announced on June 12, also requires him to plead guilty to one count of ongoing criminal conduct in Iowa at a later date and to pay restitution to Colorado, Kansas and Oklahoma for similar fraudulent lottery wins. As a result, he faces 13-1/2 years in prison and a fine of $35,000 for theft by fraud and computer crime for programming lottery software resulting in him winning nearly $800,000, Wisconsin Attorney General Brad Schimel said. His sentencing is scheduled for Sept. 21. In 2007, Tipton programmed a modified code in the random number generator software that, when certain conditions were met, produced a predictable set of winning numbers, Schimel said. He then supplied these numbers to his friend, Robert Rhodes, who purchased a winning in Wisconsin Megabucks ticket worth $783,257 on Dec. 29, 2007. Rhodes and Tipton split the proceeds.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/iowa-lottery-idUSL1N1JK1UK"},

Two people with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters early talks had started on whether and how European countries could co-operate on a new sixth-generation fighter, which could involve a combination of manned and unmanned systems. Though complicated by Britain's decision to leave the European Union, business executives and politicians at the Paris Airshow this week said U.S. President Donald Trump's cooler stance towards Europe had given the effort some fresh momentum. But they warned of massive hurdles, including bickering among European states and companies, the troubled history of past joint projects such as the A400M military transport plane, and the sheer cost of developing advanced military aircraft. Any project is likely to cost far more than the 10 billion-plus euros sunk into the Eurofighter, the last joint fighter built, at a time when Europe is grappling with other expensive problems such as increased Islamist militancy and the influx of well over a million migrants from the Middle East and Africa. Yet EU politicians are determined to increase cooperation on defence and security, and wary of effectively leaving the fighter jet market to the United States.  It's the same with food. Some things you have to be able to do yourself,  Monika Hohlmeier, a German member of the European Parliament and chair of the parliament's Sky & Space Intergroup, told Reuters during a visit to the A400M at the air show. Germany, which has begun early work on a next-generation fighter, last month asked the United States for a classified briefing on the U.S. F-35 stealth fighter built by Lockheed Martin Corp, as it prepares for a more intense look at fighter options after the Sept. 24 election. The F-35, which showed off its moves during its premiere at the Paris show, is being bought in Europe by Britain, Italy, the Netherlands, Denmark, Norway and Turkey. Belgium, Finland, Switzerland and Spain have also expressed interest. Buying the F-35 would help improve Germany's ability to fight with key allies, but could prove politically difficult in a country with strong labour unions eager to safeguard jobs. Corporate rivalries add another level of complexity. Corporate Battlelines  We are already working on the Next Generation Weapon System, which has been initiated by Germany but with strong interest from Spain and other nations, as part of a bigger concept of future combat systems including unmanned aircraft,  Fernando Alonso, head of military aircraft at Airbus, told a briefing ahead of the Paris Airshow.  And I very much hope that we will see France involved in that because it is clearly very much in all our interest to see a common solution,  he added. Airbus represents Germany and Spain in the maturing Eurofighter programme, which also includes Britain through BAE Systems and Italy via Leonardo. France, however, dropped out of that project early on due to disagreements over the sharing out of work, with its Dassault Aviation going on to develop the Rafale fighter jet. Airbus is pressing Dassault to join in this time instead of forcing Britain to choose a preferred continental partner. It is also unclear what role, if any, Sweden's SAAB might play. SAAB builds the Gripen fighter, which is in use in Sweden, South Africa and Hungary, among others. One French diplomat said it was clear no one European nation could develop a new combat jet in the current environment.  Those days are over. Period,  the diplomat said. Even the United States' F-35 was developed with funds from Britain and other countries. Volker Thum, managing director of the German Aerospace Industries Association, said Franco-German cooperation was a  key driver for the urgently needed agreement  on the project. He said new President Emmanuel Macron's arrival at the air show on an A400M signalled his commitment to European cooperation. Airbus's Alonso said this month that upgrades and modernisation would keep the Eurofighter flying into the 2040s, and possibly longer, but older warplanes like the pan-European Tornado and Spain's F/A-18s would soon need to be replaced, with buyers likely to want the latest technology and capabilities. Given the costs and timescale involved, aerospace analyst Richard Aboulafia said the need to get started on  an indigenous homegrown alternative to the F-35  was one of the biggest defence issues facing Europe. But Brexit and disagreements among remaining EU members made him sceptical.  The odds are they probably won't get their act together,  he said, citing historical angst about military issues in Germany, Europe's largest economy, and Britain's increasing focus on U.S. ties.

Chicago, a city of 2.7 million, has had 303 murders this year, down slightly from 304 over the same period last year, according to police figures. The number of shootings has dropped 15 percent to 1,277 this year. The law was a rare point of agreement between Chicago's Democratic mayor, Rahm Emanuel, and Rauner, who have clashed recently over the handling of the state's historic budget impasse.  Improving public safety is everyone's responsibility, and this law will help make neighborhoods across Illinois stronger, safer and more secure,  Emanuel said in a statement. Critics of the measure said it fails to adequately address the underlying issues driving Chicago's violence.  We believe that this violence, and the resulting stress and trauma, is both a public health and community mental health issue, and as such, would be best served by economic, public health, and social service interventions and approaches,  Stephanie Schmitz Bechteler, executive director of the research and policy center at the Chicago Urban League, which opposed the law, said by email.

In an unexpectedly divided decision, Banco de México raised its benchmark rate by a notch to 7 percent, as forecast by all 17 analysts surveyed by Reuters last week. One member voted to hold rates.     In its policy statement, the bank said  the reference rate has reached a level that is consistent with the process of efficient convergence of inflation to the 3 percent target,  hinting that further increases are no longer necessary.      The market shows they could cut as soon as December, but we don't think the bank will move that fast,  said Salvador Orozco, a strategist at Santander in Mexico City.     Economists at Morgan Stanley said it was premature to expect cuts soon.  Mexico is still not out of the inflation woods,  they wrote.      Rate-future prices indicated a nearly 100 percent probability that the central bank will keep its reference rate at 7 percent in its August meeting and showed that the market is betting on a cut in December.     The yield on Mexico's benchmark 10-year peso denominated bond bid down 27 basis points to 6.67 percent, its biggest one-day drop in two years.      Despite fading expectations of further policy tightening, the Mexican peso strengthened 0.6 percent, tracking an increase in crude prices. Mexico is a major oil exporter.

U.S.-trained urban warfare units are leading the fight in the maze of narrow alleyways of the Old City, the last district in the hands of the Sunni Islamist insurgents. Iraqi authorities are hoping to declare victory in the northern Iraqi city in the Muslim Eid holiday, which marks the end of the fasting month of Ramadan, during the next few days. Military analysts say government troops' advance will gather pace after Islamic State fighters blew up the 850-year-old al-Nuri mosque and its famous leaning minaret on Wednesday. Islamic State retaliated with a triple bombing on a neighborhood in east Mosul, the other side the Tigris River.  The attack was carried out by three people who detonated explosive belts, killing and wounding an unspecified number of people, according to a military statement.  Destruction of the mosque gives troops more freedom in attack as they no longer have to worry about damaging the ancient site. It was in the al-Nuri mosque that Islamic State's leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, proclaimed its  caliphate  over parts of Iraq and Syria three years ago.   A U.S.-led international coalition is providing air and ground support in the 8-month-old offensive to drive the militants from their de facto capital in Iraq. A map published by the Iraqi forces media office showed the elite Counter Terrorism Service pushing along al-Faruq Street, from north to south, and Nineveh Street, from east to west.  The two roads cross in the center of the Old City. When the troops reach this point, they will have isolated the remaining IS fighters in four separate pockets.   The aim is to open ways for civilians to evacuate. We give them indications by loudspeaker when it's possible,  an Iraqi military spokesman told Reuters by phone. Some 7,000 civilians were brought out of the Old City this week, the Iraqi state news website said. Several street intersections were seized during the day. Reuters journalists in Mosul saw people reaching safety. Some were injured and some had been carried on army humvees to rear positions where they were given bananas, biscuits and water.  The army's 16th division evacuated us,  said a man who had fled with his wife and 15-day-old baby.  God bless them,  said another man, who was limping. Medical workers attend to a displaced civilian shot by an ISIS State militant sniper, after he was rescued by Iraqi security forces from battle at Old City in western Mosul, Iraq June 23, 2017.Erik De CastroDoctors Without Borders (MSF) reported an influx of wounded to its trauma clinic in the west of the war-torn city on Friday morning.  This ... is yet another example of the horrific suffering and indiscriminate violence suffered by civilians, including women and children,  said Jonathan Henry, MSF Emergency Coordinator for West Mosul, in a statement.   More than 100,000 civilians, of whom half are children, are trapped in the crumbling old houses of the Old City, with little food, water or medical treatment. Aid organizations say Islamic State has stopped many from leaving, using them as human shields. Hundreds of civilians fleeing the Old City have been killed in the past three weeks. Rubble Of  The Hunchback   The Iraqi government once hoped to take Mosul by the end of 2016, but the bloody campaign has dragged on as the militants reinforced positions in civilian areas, launched suicide car and motorbike bombs, laid booby traps and kept up barrages of sniper and mortar fire. Slideshow (9 Images)The military said it had defused dozens of booby traps as troops advanced on Friday.  The area still under IS control is about 2 square kilometers (0.77 square miles) in extent, alongside the western bank of the Tigris, which bisects Mosul. The fall of Mosul would mark the end of the Iraqi half of the militants'  caliphate  as a state structure, but Islamic State would remain in control of large areas of both Iraq and Syria. Islamic State posted a video online showing the remaining square base of the mosque's leaning minaret amid a mountain of rubble, with wrecked cars nearby.  The destruction caused anger and grief for Mosul's people, who affectionately call the tower al-Hadba, or  the hunchback . Islamic State's black flag had been flying on the 150-foot (45-metre) minaret since June 2014. Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said the militants' decision to blow it up was an admission of defeat. Baghdadi has left the fighting in Mosul to local commanders and has been assumed to be hiding in the Iraqi-Syrian border area. There has been no confirmation of Russian reports over the past week that he has been killed, and officials in the region  are skeptical.   We don't have any concrete evidence on whether or not he's dead either,  U.S. Army Colonel Ryan Dillon, spokesman for the international coalition battling Islamic State, told a Pentagon briefing. In Syria, the insurgents'  capital , Raqqa, is nearly encircled by a U.S.-backed Kurdish-led coalition.   We certainly know that if he is still alive, we expect that he is not being able to influence what is currently happening in Raqqa or Mosul or overall in the ISIS (Islamic State) as they continue to lose their physical caliphate,  Dillon said. U.S. intelligence officials say Islamic State has moved most of its leaders, along with its online propaganda operation and its limited command and control of attacks in Europe and elsewhere, to Al Mayadin in eastern Syria's Deir al Zour province.

Hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans have taken to the streets across the country since April to demand elections, solutions to hunger and shortages, and an end to President Nicolas Maduro's plan to overhaul the constitution. On Thursday, a thousands-strong march that was aiming to reach the chief prosecutor's office in Caracas was broken up by security forces with tear gas and pellets. Protesters burned a truck, before dispersing to a wide junction on an urban freeway that has been the site of clashes on several occasions recently. The freeway runs past La Carlota air base, and soldiers and National Guards fired gas from inside the perimeter of the base to try to clear the highway. About a hundred protesters threw rocks back and began to tear a part of the fence.  Garcia, who has photographed this spot many times, used a concrete barrier in the road for protection and shot the scene with a long lens.   There are several points, on the bridge of the junction, or below, but always trying to keep ourselves covered by the crash barrier of the freeway,  said Garcia, 38.   Yesterday, the protesters broke open the fence.  In a matter of seconds, a youth standing in the gap in the fence jumped down as a group of military men carrying long firearms approached from inside the base.  David Jose Vallenilla, 22, was crouched down on the highway by the fence. At this moment he stood up, protected only by a small rucksack strapped to his chest, and just a few feet from the soldier, who began shooting. Garcia captured the moment in a series of photos, as Vallenilla falls to the ground, then gets to his feet to escape, as another activist wrapped in the Venezuelan flag and carrying a flimsy wooden shield tries to give him cover and also comes under fire. Garcia rushed in as protesters gathered round Vallenilla to drag him away, and captured another stark image, of the young man's face as paramedics drove him away on a motorbike.   By then he looked very bad, badly injured,  he said.  Vallenilla died in hospital a few minutes later. At least 75 people have been killed since the protests began in April. The protest outside the air base carried on after shooting.   It was the second time in a week that media caught on camera military elements firing weapons at protesters resulting in deaths. In response the government has swiftly detained several members of the security forces accused of the shootings. A former small businessman who owned phone shops, Garcia has been covering Venezuela for Reuters for more than a decade. His daughter was born two weeks before the latest protests exploded in April. He says the mood is different than a previous round of demonstrations three years ago.  This time people have lost their fear of authority, they are furious,  Garcia said.  Before, many protesters would run as a soon as they smelt tear gas, now they don't run.   He said that over the past month the protests against Maduro have become more intense and less organized, meaning photographers must move with the ebb and flow of the demonstrators. His team tries to place itself in different spots, somewhere high up, somewhere at mid distance and somewhere close.   The opposition protests have been getting more chaotic as the days pass, more disorganized, now it's not two groups fighting each other,  said Garcia, describing the challenge of following the protests as they fracture into small groups.   Every day is different.

In fact, in a recent group of elderly patients, “the benefit of an ideal cardiovascular health in reducing mortality and vascular events was comparable to what is observed in younger populations,” Dr. Bamba Gaye from University Paris Descartes in France told Reuters Health by email. “This is a very good news, which suggests that it is never too late to prevent the development of risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD).” Gaye and colleagues analyzed whether achieving some or all of the American Heart Association (AHA) seven “ideal” goals – “Life’s Simple 7” - would affect people’s risk of dying or having a stroke or heart attack during a specific study period. The seven goals include: -Keep body mass index (BMI) - a ratio of weight to height - lower than the overweight cutoff; -Never start smoking, or have stopped at least 12 months ago; -For at least 75 minutes a week, perform vigorous activity, or perform moderate physical activity at least 150 minutes a week; -Follow a healthy diet that includes vegetables and fresh fruit daily, fish twice or more a week, and less than 450 calories a week from sugar; -Keep blood pressure below 120/80 without medication; -Maintain a normal cholesterol level without medication; -Maintain a normal blood sugar without medication. Out of the 7371 study participants, whose average age was 74, only one individual had met all seven goals. Only 5% of participants met at least five goals, researchers reported in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology. For all goals except physical activity and total cholesterol, women were more likely than men to be at ideal levels.  The research team tracked the study subjects to monitor their health; half of the participants were tracked more than nine years.  Compared to people who meet no more than two of the goals, in those who met three or four the risk of death during the study was reduced by 16 percent, and meeting five to seven goals cut the risk by 29 percent. In fact, the risk of death fell by 10 percent for each additional goal at the ideal level. Similarly, the risk of coronary heart disease and stroke fell by 22 percent for each additional goal at the ideal level. “The ideal goal would be to have no risk factors for cardiovascular disease at all,” Gaye said. “However, our study also shows a graded benefit on outcome according to the number of risk factors at the optimal level. Hence, a perhaps more realistic approach would be to advise older subjects to have at least one risk factor at an optimal level, and to progressively gain more risk factors at optimal level.”  “We would like emphasize that (good) health in general and cardiovascular health in particular is the cornerstone of (good) life and we all need to take care of it over the life course,” Gaye concluded. “The good news is that it is never too late to optimize our own health in elderhood.” “The goal of successful aging is not immortality, but limiting time spent with illness and disability,” writes Dr. Karen P. Alexander from Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, North Carolina in an editorial published with the study.  This study, she continued, “reminds us that risk factor and lifestyle modifications have no expiration date and continue to yield benefits for a healthy old age, well beyond age 70.” “Older adults should focus not so much on the perfect attainment of Life’s Simple 7, but on the process of working to achieve these goals,” she concludes. Dr. Dana E. King from West Virginia University Medicine, Morgantown, West Virginia, who has studied elderly health extensively, told Reuters Health by email,  It is never too late to start or improve your healthy lifestyle habits. Elderly people who adopt healthier diets, get active, and quit smoking, actually benefit sooner and to a greater degree than young people.” SOURCE: bit.ly/2sOWXS0 and bit.ly/2s51MCd Journal of the American College of Cardiology, online June 19, 2017.

Abramoff's filing, saying that in December he worked to set up a meeting between Republic of Congo President Denis Sassou Nguesso and then-President-elect Donald Trump, was the first to show that he has resumed work as a lobbyist. Federal law requires Americans acting on behalf of a foreign entity - either as a lobbyist or doing other messaging work - to register with the Department of Justice. While Abramoff told Justice that he accepted no payment for his work on behalf of Nguesso, the filings are a clear indication that he believes he met the legal definition of lobbying. Had Abramoff done lobbying work for domestic companies before December, he would have had to disclose that to Congress. He has made no such disclosures.  In his filing with the Justice Department, Abramoff said he did not succeed in arranging a meeting between Nguesso and Trump in Palm Beach, Florida.  Abramoff in 2006 pleaded guilty to felony counts of conspiracy, fraud, and tax evasion. His name became synonymous with government corruption, and Democrats attacked their Republican opponents who had ties or had received campaign donations from him.

Abramoff was released from federal prison in 2010 and was then subject to three years on probation. The work that Abramoff did for Nguesso is described by the former lobbyist as a one-off incident. According to Abramoff, Congo officials enlisted Iancu Costel, a consultant in Romania, with the goal of improving U.S. relations, expanding trade, getting help fighting Boko Haram and stemming illegal immigration to the U.S. In turn, Costel asked Abramoff to help.  Abramoff said in the filing that he contacted Republican U.S. Representative Dana Rohrabacher for assistance in trying to arrange the meeting. According to Abramoff, Rohrabacher was the only government official he spoke with while helping Nguesso. In his disclosure, Abramoff said he did not plan to work with Costel again.      An Abramoff attorney pointed to the filings when asked for comment. Neither Costel nor a spokesman for Rohrabacher could immediately be reached for comment.

The Pentagon ended its ban on openly transgender people serving in the U.S. military in 2016 under the Obama administration. It was expected to also start allowing transgender individuals to begin enlisting this year, provided they had been  stable  in their preferred gender for 18 months. News of a potential delay under President Donald Trump's administration alarmed transgender advocates.  There are thousands of transgender service members openly and proudly serving our nation today ... what matters is the ability to get the job done — not their gender identity,   said Stephen Peters of the Human Rights Campaign.

Higher cattle prices paid by packers last month generated more profits for feedlot operators, allowing them to buy more calves for fattening.     Cattle that entered feedyards last month will be ready for processing beginning around October, analysts said.     On Monday, Chicago Mercantile Exchange live cattle futures        may see a mildly bearish response to Friday's report because placements were not as high as some investors had anticipated, said analysts.     Market participants will mainly focus on next week's cattle and wholesale beef prices, they said, after both declined this week.     USDA's report showed May placements at 2.119 million head, up from 1.889 million a year earlier and above the average forecast of 2.085 million. It was the most for the month since 2.159 million in 2007.     The government put the feedlot cattle supply as of June 1 at 11.096 million head, up 3.0 percent from 10.804 million a year ago. Analysts, on average, forecast a 2.4 percent gain.     USDA said the number of cattle sold to packers, or marketings, were up 9.0 percent in May from a year ago, to 1.951 million head.     Analysts had projected an increase of 8.5 percent from 1.794 million last year.      It's all about the economics of cattle feeding returns near unprecedented levels that continued to pull cattle into feedyards aggressively,  said Livestock Marketing Information Center (LMIC) director Jim Robb.     LMIC calculated that feedlots in May, on average, made a profit of $262 per steer sold to meat companies, which is  in spitting distance  of the October 2003 record of about $269, said Robb.     U.S. Commodities President Don Roose said that after a period of monetary losses, producers began rushing cattle to feedlots  when they saw a light at the end of the tunnel profit-wise.      Reasonably-priced feed contributed to reduced input costs for cattle feeders, which has helped support their margins, he said.     Roose noted that states in the Corn Belt led the way in terms of placements, which he partly attributed to animals that were displaced by drought conditions in the northern U.S. Plains.

Jassim Saif Al Sulaiti told Reuters the Gulf state was pushing to  get more routes for Qatar  and wants the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) to open international air routes over Gulf waters currently managed by the United Arab Emirates.  The UAE is among four countries, including Saudi Arabia,  Bahrain and Egypt, that have closed their airspace to Qatar, forcing state-owned Qatar Airways to fly longer, more expensive routes. The four Arab states that imposed a boycott on Qatar have issued an ultimatum to Doha to close Al Jazeera television, curb ties with Iran, shut a Turkish base and pay reparations. It appears compliance would be difficult with the far-reaching demands. A decision on Friday by the Montreal-headquartered ICAO to hold the briefing next week follows concerns by Qatar Airways chief executive Akbar Al-Baker, who recently suggested the U.N agency was not working quickly enough to resolve the dispute. By contrast, Al Sulaiti said he trusted ICAO to find a solution to the dispute, and  take action very quickly.  ICAO's 36-state governing council can act to settle the overflights row presented by Qatar, but such interventions are rare and time-consuming because the specialized UN agency usually negotiates disputes diplomatically through consensus.  ICAO cannot impose rules on states, but regulators from its 191-member countries almost always adopt and enforce its international aviation standards.  Qatar has asked ICAO to use a dispute resolution mechanism in the Chicago Convention, a 1944 treaty that created the agency and set rules for international aviation.  Article 84 says that if two states cannot resolve a dispute related to the convention through negotiation, one can ask the council to settle it, although the process is long. It took years to resolve a dispute in the late 1990s between Cuba and the United States, which would not allow Cuban carriers to fly through U.S. airspace on the way to Canada because of Washington's economic embargo on Cuba, said Armand de Mestral, a professor emeritus of international law at McGill University. Cuba was eventually allowed to resume flights with restrictions, a precedent that would bolster Qatar's case, he said.

The opinions expressed here are his own.) By John Lloyd June 23 (Reuters) - We are beginning to glimpse what underpins Emmanuel Macron’s success. France’s new president has amazed Europe with the speed and élan of his rise, from a former minister to head of the republic in less than a year, from political neophyte to creator and leader of a winning party. He has amazed that world, too, with his charm, his debate incisiveness and ideological creativity, plucking ideas and policies now from the left, now from the right. It’s ruthlessness that has got him there. This week, he caused four ministers to leave his cabinet, three of whom were members of the closely allied MoDem party and one who had played a large part in building Macron’s own Republique en Marche. No talk of being innocent till proven guilty. All are being investigated for (relatively mild) corruption and it’s only a preliminary inquiry, but the accusation was enough to force them out. Bolstering the impression of Macron’s ruthlessness, the French media on Wednesday were full of anonymous quotes to the effect that he exercised tight control over ministers: “an outsized ego” who “stops them governing,” said the unnamed party sources. Macron will need to be both ruthless and controlling. He now embarks on a twofold mission to succeed where his predecessors have failed, in a France seen as declining in its economy, its status and its optimism. That mission is, first, to revivify France, and second, to re-establish it as an equal partner with Germany in revivifying the European Union. He’s beginning with France. Though his clean sweep of presidency and parliament has been impressive, he will be uneasily aware of a record low voter turnout in the June parliamentary elections and that holding the center means both left and right are against him. He has already made clear that he wants to begin negotiations with the labor unions on injecting more flexibility into workplaces - easier firing, more hiring. In doing so he faces what one commentator has termed “the mother of all battles”  with organizations that have stymied change for decades. It will be a clash of different experiences and reflexes. Macron is young and educated at elite institutions, the unions are creatures of an industrial age in which job security and increasing wages were the start and finish of bargaining. The European Union is a larger challenge, in part because he can control it less. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the undisputed but lonely leader of the EU, was visibly relieved by his election. She gushed immediately after his May win that Macron “carries the hopes of millions of French people and also of very many people in Germany and in the whole of Europe.” However, Merkel faces a tough election on September 24 and must calibrate her response to him to avoid alienating her voters. “German support cannot replace French policy making,” she said drily after her enthusiastic welcome to Macron. I don’t see why - as a priority - we should change our policy.” The chancellor was saying that she would not consider the loosening of the fiscal rules on which Germany insists and of her government’s attitude that France and other “Club Med” countries must stop piling on debt that digs them deeper into an economic hole. Then there’s Italy, which has succeeded Greece as the center of Europe’s concern. The third largest economy in the eurozone, Italy’s forecast growth rate of one percent this year lags behind the modest growth in the rest of the EU and does little for the country’s dangerously indebted economy and banking sector. Opposition to the EU is growing in Italy, where an election is likely early next year, perhaps late this one. Although the populist euroskeptic Five Star Movement did badly in recent mayoral elections, it still tops the national polls. The never-to-be-discounted Silvio Berlusconi is also pledging to relaunch his Forza Italia party, while his allies on the right - the League and the Brothers of Italy - all reject pubic disaffection with the EU and could together beat the governing Democratic Party. An ailing, politically turbulent Italy poses a bigger danger to EU reform because, unlike Greece, the Italian economy is too big to save from default. Macron must conquer these problems - along with the agonies of Brexit negotiations and the continued hostility of the central European members Poland, Hungary and Slovakia to much EU policy, especially on immigration - if he is to join Merkel as chief engineer in the Union’s engine room. He has the wind behind him. But the opposing headwinds will be as strong. (Reporting by John Lloyd)","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/lloyd-macron-idUSL1N1JK1T6"},

Both sources spoke on condition of anonymity because the matter is confidential.  Wal-Mart spokesman Greg Hitt declined to comment on whether the company is considering a bid for Whole Foods. Whole Foods and Amazon did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Whole Foods shares have been trading above Amazon's deal price of $42 per share since the deal was announced last Friday, as stock market investors speculate about the possibility of a higher offer.   Whole Foods shares reached a high of $43.84 earlier on Friday, but dropped after Reuters reported that no rival bids have so far emerged. Its shares were last trading after hours at $42.85. Wal-Mart had been tipped as a potential bidder for Whole Foods by retail analysts, although Hitt previously called reports that Wal-Mart might put in a rival offer  false and baseless.

In the early morning, I climbed up to the roof of my house and was stunned to see the Hadba minaret had gone,  Nashwan, a day-laborer who lives near the mosque, said by phone.  I felt I had lost a son of mine.  His words echoed the shock and anger of many over the destruction of the Grand al-Nuri Mosque along with its famous minaret, known affectionately as  the hunchback  by Iraqis.  The demolition came on Wednesday night as Iraqi forces closed in on the mosque, which carried enormous symbolic importance for Islamic State (IS). It was there that its leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi declared a  caliphate  as militants seized swathes of Syria and Iraq. He proclaimed himself the caliph, ruler of all Muslims, from the mosque's pulpit.   His black flag had been flying on the 150-foot (45-metre) minaret since June 2014, after Islamic State fighters surged across Iraq.  Russia said on Thursday there was a high degree of certainty Baghdadi was dead, according to RIA news agency. Moscow said last week its forces might have killed him, but Western and Iraqi officials are skeptical. Baghdadi has left the fighting in Mosul to local commanders and is believed to be hiding in the border area between Iraq and Syria. Liberation  In Days  Some analysts said the destruction of the mosque could in fact speed the advance of government forces, which had been slowed by fear of damaging it. Related CoverageFrench special forces not specifically targeting jihadis: chiefIraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi went further.  Blowing up the al-Hadba minaret and the al-Nuri mosque amounts to an official acknowledgement of defeat,  he said on his website.   It's a matter of a few days and we will announce the total liberation of Mosul,  he later told reporters in Baghdad, pledging to rebuild the mosque and other historical sites destroyed by the insurgents.  The jihadists appear to have chosen to blow up the mosque rather than see their flag torn down by U.S.-backed Iraqi forces battling through the maze of narrow alleys and streets of the Old City, the last district of Mosul still under the control of Islamic State. In the dawn light, all that remained was the base projecting from shattered masonry. A video on social media showed the minaret collapsing vertically, throwing up a pall of sand and dust. Defense analysts said the decision to destroy the mosque could indicate the militants were on the verge of collapse. Mosul's destroyed Grand al-Nuri Mosque is seen in Mosul, Iraq June 22, 2017. Iraqi alsumaria tv channel/Handout via REUTERS They had said they would fight until their last breath defending the mosque,  Baghdad-based security expert Safaa al-A’sam told Reuters.  The fact is that they are no longer capable of standing in the face of Iraqi government forces.  The minaret had seven bands of decorative brickwork in a type of complex geometric pattern also found in Persia and Central Asia. Its tilt and the lack of maintenance made it particularly vulnerable to blasts. U.S. Army Colonel Ryan Dillon, spokesman for the U.S.-led international coalition assisting the Iraqi effort to defeat Islamic State, said Iraqi security forces were continuing to  push into remaining IS-held territory.   There are two square kilometers left in West Mosul before the entire city is liberated,  he told Reuters by phone. The fall of Mosul would mark the effective end of the Iraqi half of the  caliphate , though Islamic State would still hold  some territory west and south of the city. U.S.-backed militias are also closing on Islamic State's Syrian stronghold, Raqqa. Slideshow (6 Images) Symbol of Identity  The United Nations' education organization UNESCO said the Mosul minaret and mosque  stood as a symbol of identity, resilience and belonging  and it deplored their destruction. The mosque was named after Nuruddin al-Zanki, a noble who fought the early crusaders from a fiefdom that covered territory in modern-day Turkey, Syria and Iraq. The mosque's military and religious history embodied the spirit of Mosul, a city which supplied Iraq's armed forces with officers for much of the 20th century.  With the fall of Saddam Hussein in the 2003 U.S.-led invasion, the Sunni city balked at its loss of influence and some local people joined the insurgency against the new Shi'ite rulers of the country. When Islamic State swept into Mosul in June 2014, they were welcomed by those who saw the takeover as promising an end to harsh treatment by Shi'ite-led security forces. The mosque's destruction comes in the holiest period of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, its final 10 days. The night of Laylat al-Qadr falls during this period, when Muslims believe the Koran was revealed to the prophet Mohammed. Islamic State fighters have destroyed many Muslim religious sites and Christian churches and shrines, as well as ancient Assyrian and Roman-era sites in Iraq and in Syria.  Many different enemies controlled Mosul over the past 900 years but none of them dared to destroy the Hadba,  said Ziad, an art student in Mosul.  By bombing the minaret, they proved they are the worst of all barbarian groups in history.

A negative report from the IRSN, the technical arm of French nuclear regulator ASN, would have been a major setback for EDF, costing billions of euros and years of delays as the reactor vessel has been welded in place and the reactor dome was sealed in 2013. Its safety was under scrutiny because of excessive carbon concentrations - which can make steel brittle - in its base and cover. But the report, a copy of which was obtained by Reuters, says the reactor will be able to operate safely, although it will need extra monitoring over its lifetime. A favorable ruling by the nuclear safety authority is also a European Commission condition for its approval of EDF's takeover of state-owned Areva's reactor unit, which has designed the Flamanville European Pressurised Reactor (EPR). EDF also plans to build two EPRs in Hinkley Point, Britain.  The (ASN and IRSN) consider that the anomaly does not put into question the fitness for service of the reactor vessel base, on condition that tests scheduled by EDF are adapted so as to detect any faults,  the report said in its conclusion.  The report added that these tests, which will have to be done before the reactor's first scheduled ten-year inspection, are of a nature to significantly reinforce safety levels.  The report, written jointly by the IRSN and ASN, said that tests of the reactor cover also show that its mechanical properties are sufficient to prevent a brutal rupture.  For the cover too, additional monitoring will be required during the lifetime of the reactor, but since testing of the cover had been less extensive than the base, closer monitoring would be required. Final Ruling in Autumn A group of independent nuclear experts, who received the report last week, will discuss the 180-page document on Monday and Tuesday to formulate an opinion. The ASN has said it will make the report public following the experts' meeting. Based on the IRSN report and the experts' input, the ASN will draft a provisional ruling - expected in July - about the reactor which it will submit for public consultation until September. Once that consultation over, it will issue a binding ruling on whether the reactor can start up as scheduled in 2018.  Industry experts say it is unlikely that the ASN would deviate far from the IRSN report, as no new technical investigations will be done.  In an interview with Les Echos newspaper early this month, EDF's CEO Jean-Bernard Levy had said that he was  more confident than ever  that the ASN would clear the safety of the vessel.  Early 2015, when the carbon concentrations were discovered, ASN director Pierre-Franck Chevet said these represented a very serious anomaly as they affect a crucial reactor component on which no risk of rupture can be taken. A source familiar with the ASN report said that while carbon concentrations of about 0.30 percent in some areas were above the regulatory maximum of 0.22 percent, the deviation was not of a nature to threaten the integrity of the reactor in case of physical or thermal shocks.  The source added that the excess carbon concentrations are only present in the base and cover of the vessel, made by Areva-owned foundry Creusot Forge, but not in the vessel's hull, which is more exposed to radiation than the base and cover.  France's anti-nuclear organizations have repeatedly called on the ASN not to approve Flamanville.  Under pressure from EDF and Areva ... the nuclear watchdog is getting ready to give the green light for this defective piece of equipment which does not meet safety criteria,  Sortir du Nucleaire action group said in a statement early this month.

Italy plans to start liquidation proceedings for Banca Popolare di Vicenza and Veneto Banca on Saturday, a source close to the matter said, issuing an emergency decree that will effectively remove one its biggest banking headaches by splitting the two lenders' assets into  good  and  bad  banks. The country's top retail bank Intesa Sanpaolo (ISP.MI) is set to buy the good assets for one euro, leaving the state to foot the bulk of the bill for losses stemming from the banks' bad loans, legal risks and restructuring costs.   EU state aid rules allow for the possibility of granting state support in these kind of situations,  the European Commission, which must rule on the use of state money, said in a statement.  It added it was in constructive discussions with Italian authorities.  Good progress is being made to find a solution very soon.   The Italian government has been scrambling to prevent the two lenders from being wound down under European banking rules designed to stop the use of state money in banking crises.  Rome feared that under those rules losses could have been imposed on senior bondholders and large depositors, a politically unpalatable prospect in the run-up to elections next year. Instead, under the Italian plan only junior bondholders and shareholders will be hit, but the cost for taxpayers is likely to be hefty.  With the two banks' soured or risky debts totaling more than 20 billion euros ($22.4 billion), one banker said the government would put in 5 billion euros, while some Italian media reports on Friday said the final bill could be as high as 12 billion euros. The logo of Veneto Banca bank is seen in Venice, Italy, January 31, 2016.Alessandro Bianchi/File PhotoThe emergency decree to be approved on Saturday will  create the conditions  for a sale of the banks' good assets to Intesa, the source said.   The sale will allow the regular functioning of the banks' branches on Monday morning,  it said, adding the terms of the transaction will be made public in coming days. Earlier the European Central Bank said the two banks, which have a capital shortfall of 6.4 billion euros and are bleeding deposits, were failing or likely to fail, setting in motion the process that will lead to them being wound down.  The ECB had given the banks time to present capital plans, but the banks had been unable to offer credible solutions going forward,  it said in a statement. Pressure on Rome to find a solution for the two Veneto lenders had increased since Spain's Banco Popular POP.MC was rescued by Santander (SAN.MC) this month in a deal orchestrated by European authorities. In Popular's case, no state money was used and Santander is seeking around 7 billion euros of capital from shareholders to help it take on Popular. The Italian plan instead takes advantage of an exception to EU bank rules that allows the use of routine insolvency proceedings with banks not considered systemically important, allowing the process to be handled by the member state. The plan has sparked criticism from some European officials who said Italy was being allowed to cut corners, while at home, opposition politicians have also criticized the scheme put forward by the government.  Intesa gets a free gift, the state takes on all the bad stuff and the taxpayer pays,  Renato Brunetta, parliamentary leader for former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia (Go Italy!) party said on Thursday.  Did we really need to take so much time to come up with such a rubbish solution?

They are using advances in gut testing to boost health and fitness as they gear up to battle back against New Zealand and win the oldest trophy in international sport. Improving their internal health has improved the number of days the team can sail and train and cut illness rates as they ramp up training in a bid to cut a 3-0 New Zealand lead.  Oracle's gains could also have implications for other sports, businesses and general health and wellbeing as the focus shifts to preventative medicine. A chance meeting in Bermuda between Dr Erika Angle, CEO and co-founder of Ixcela, a biotechnology firm which has developed microbiome tests, and Scott Tindal, Oracle's head physio and team nutritionist, started the U.S. team's foray into stomach health. The gut balances of Oracle's 13 sailors were tested using Ixcela's kit. Their diet was modified based on the results and they also took tailored supplements and probiotics.  We saw a significantly large improvement in performance. This is the front end of the wave,  Angle said.   Oracle experienced a 30 percent reduction in the incidence of upper respiratory tract infections, a 47.5 percent gain in the number of sailing days lost to illness and a 54 percent improvement in the number of training days lost.  It's only going to get better with different tests for professional sports and individuals,  Tindal said. One sailor who suffered from 17 upper respiratory tract infections had that number cut to one and another had 12 similar illnesses reduced to three.  This doesn't stop you from getting sick, but it does reduce the incidence and severity. You do get sick, but you bounce back quicker, that's powerful and significant in a sporting context,  Tindal said.  The introduction of 50-foot catamarans that  fly  on hydrofoils into the America's Cup has increased the physical demands on sailors who are operating at 90 percent plus heart rates during the races as they grind winches by hand or cycle on bikes to move massive wing sails.  We've not seen these levels of fitness in sailing before,  Tindal said.  Oracle is putting in punishingly long days on the water ahead of the resumption of racing on Saturday, leaving the sailors shaking before team coaches helped them rebalance their energy.  This compares to 20-minute races that burn around 500 calories per sailor.  Editing by Ed Osmond","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-sailing-americas-nutrition-idUSKBN19E2IB"},

Italy plans to start liquidation proceedings for Banca Popolare di Vicenza and Veneto Banca on Saturday, a source close to the matter said, issuing an emergency decree that will effectively remove one its biggest banking headaches by splitting the two lenders' assets into  good  and  bad  banks. The country's top retail bank Intesa Sanpaolo (ISP.MI) is set to buy the good assets for one euro, leaving the state to foot the bulk of the bill for losses stemming from the banks' bad loans, legal risks and restructuring costs.   EU state aid rules allow for the possibility of granting state support in these kind of situations,  the European Commission, which must rule on the use of state money, said in a statement.  It added it was in constructive discussions with Italian authorities.  Good progress is being made to find a solution very soon.   The Italian government has been scrambling to prevent the two lenders from being wound down under European banking rules designed to stop the use of state money in banking crises.  Rome feared that under those rules losses could have been imposed on senior bondholders and large depositors, a politically unpalatable prospect in the run-up to elections next year. Instead, under the Italian plan only junior bondholders and shareholders will be hit, but the cost for taxpayers is likely to be hefty.  With the two banks' soured or risky debts totaling more than 20 billion euros ($22.4 billion), one banker said the government would put in 5 billion euros, while some Italian media reports on Friday said the final bill could be as high as 12 billion euros. The logo of Veneto Banca bank is seen in Venice, Italy, January 31, 2016.Alessandro Bianchi/File PhotoThe emergency decree to be approved on Saturday will  create the conditions  for a sale of the banks' good assets to Intesa, the source said.   The sale will allow the regular functioning of the banks' branches on Monday morning,  it said, adding the terms of the transaction will be made public in coming days. Earlier the European Central Bank said the two banks, which have a capital shortfall of 6.4 billion euros and are bleeding deposits, were failing or likely to fail, setting in motion the process that will lead to them being wound down.  The ECB had given the banks time to present capital plans, but the banks had been unable to offer credible solutions going forward,  it said in a statement. Pressure on Rome to find a solution for the two Veneto lenders had increased since Spain's Banco Popular POP.MC was rescued by Santander (SAN.MC) this month in a deal orchestrated by European authorities. In Popular's case, no state money was used and Santander is seeking around 7 billion euros of capital from shareholders to help it take on Popular. The Italian plan instead takes advantage of an exception to EU bank rules that allows the use of routine insolvency proceedings with banks not considered systemically important, allowing the process to be handled by the member state. The plan has sparked criticism from some European officials who said Italy was being allowed to cut corners, while at home, opposition politicians have also criticized the scheme put forward by the government.  Intesa gets a free gift, the state takes on all the bad stuff and the taxpayer pays,  Renato Brunetta, parliamentary leader for former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia (Go Italy!) party said on Thursday.  Did we really need to take so much time to come up with such a rubbish solution?

Ng Lap Seng, 69, has pleaded not guilty to charges he paid hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes. The Chinese national, who was once linked to a Democratic fundraising scandal when Bill Clinton was U.S. president, is one of at least seven people charged since 2015 in the U.N.-related federal corruption probe. Jury selection is set to begin before U.S. District Judge Vernon Broderick in Manhattan. A trial could last several weeks. Prosecutors said Ng paid more than $500,000 in bribes to John Ashe, a former U.N. General Assembly president and ambassador from Antigua and Barbuda, and bribed Francis Lorenzo, a former deputy U.N. ambassador from the Dominican Republic. In exchange, Ng hoped the diplomats would provide U.N. support to help the Sun Kian Ip Group founder build the conference center, prosecutors said. The center was never built.

Lorenzo has pleaded guilty to bribery and money laundering and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors. Three other defendants have also pleaded guilty. Defense lawyers have argued that Ng's prosecution was politically motivated, to help the U.S. government check China's influence over developing countries that might have used the conference center as a permanent meeting venue. Ng's businesses also include apparel and casinos, and he has  sat on the Chinese government's Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. In 1998, a U.S. Senate report said he had from 1994 to 1996 funneled hundreds of thousands of dollars through an Arkansas restaurateur to the Democratic National Committee as it worked to re-elect Clinton, who knew the restaurateur. Ng was not charged in the matter, known as  Chinagate,  and Broderick has said prosecutors may not discuss it at trial. Ng was arrested in September 2015. He was freed the next month on $50 million bail, and permitted to live under 24-hour guard in a luxury apartment in Midtown Manhattan.

It gave no details on what it meant by  pulled out  but said it had intervened in the loan renegotiation talks to prevent job losses and asset stripping. Etisalat Nigeria had repaid $500 million of the loan before it defaulted in February due to a currency devaluation and its only remaining investors are its Nigerian partners, led by company chairman Hakeem Belo-Osagie. On Tuesday, parent company United Arab Emirates' Etisalat, said it was carrying its 45-percent stake at nil value, and that the Nigerian lenders had ordered it to transfer its shares to a loan trustee by June 23 after the renegotiation failed. Neither Etisalat nor Mubadala, which owns 40 percent of Etisalat Nigeria, could be reached for comment.   Given the inability of Etisalat (Nigeria) to come to an acceptable agreement with the banks, the largest shareholder in the company, Dubai-based Mubadala Development Company of the United Arab Emirates, has now pulled out of the company as well as the ongoing negotiations,  the central bank said.  It was based on the attempt of the banks to takeover the company that the financial and telecommunications regulators have moved in to intervene and forestall down-sizing and asset stripping,  it said. In March, the central bank, which is also the banking watchdog, and the Nigeria Communications Commission (NCC)regulator tried to prevent lenders placing the firm in receivership to avoid a wider debt crisis and agreed with banks to pursue a default deal. But lenders, under pressure to avoid loan-loss provisions, have been pushing to finalize a restructuring before half-yearly audits this month. Central bank spokesman Isaac Okorafor said representatives from the central bank and the telecoms regulator would hold talks in the next few days with lenders and IHS Towers, the mobile phone tower managers, as well as  equipment suppliers . The original loan was a seven-year facility to refinance a $650 million loan and fund expansion of Etisalat Nigeria's network. The company missed payments in February after sharp falls in the Nigerian naira bloated the loan's value, making repayments difficult.

The House of Representatives narrowly passed its healthcare bill last month. If the Senate passes its bill, the House will either have to vote on the Senate version of the legislation or the two chambers will have to reconcile their differences in a conference committee. Obamacare extended coverage to some 20 million additional Americans through both subsidized private insurance and an expansion of Medicaid. Since its passage in 2010, Republicans have campaigned on repealing the program and argued that the law is too costly and represents undue government interference in Americans' healthcare. Here is how the two bills compare on their main provisions: Medicaid Under Obamacare, more than 30 states, including about a dozen states with Republican governors, expanded the Medicaid government health insurance program for the poor and disabled. Both bills would roll back the expansion and significantly overhaul the program, which provides insurance to nearly 70 million people. SENATE: The draft legislation would phase out Obamacare's expansion of Medicaid over three years, from 2021 to 2024. It would then overhaul the program and reduce its federal funding more than the House bill would, beginning in 2025. HOUSE: The bill would allow the Medicaid expansion to continue until Jan. 1, 2020. After that date, expansion would end, and people who enrolled in the expansion could not re-enroll once they leave. Medicaid funding would be capped on a per-person basis. Taxes SENATE: The bill would repeal most Obamacare taxes beginning after Dec. 31, 2016, including the 3.8 percent net investment income tax on wealthy Americans. The tax on branded prescription brands would be repealed in 2018, and the legislation would delay the so-called Cadillac tax on high-cost employer-provided insurance. It would also provide more generous tax credits for the purchase of private health insurance for people between zero and 350 percent of the federal poverty level based on income. Under Obamacare, those between 100 and 400 percent of the federal poverty level were eligible for tax credits. HOUSE: The bill would repeal most Obamacare taxes retroactively after Dec. 31, 2016, and delay the Cadillac tax to 2026. It would provide flat age-based tax credits for the purchase of private health insurance ranging from $2,000 to $4,000 per year that would be capped at upper-income levels. Mandates Both bills would repeal the penalties associated with the individual mandate that nearly everyone purchase health insurance or else pay a fine, and the mandate that employers provide insurance to employees. Coverage SENATE: The legislation would maintain the popular Obamacare provision that young adults be allowed to stay on their parents' health insurance until age 26. It would also prevent insurers from discriminating against those with pre-existing conditions, but would give states flexibility to opt out of so-called essential health benefits, such as maternity care and prescription drug coverage, that experts said could make it harder for some sick people to find affordable plans. The bill would also allow insurers to charge older Americans up to five times more than younger Americans. HOUSE: The bill would allow young adults to remain on their parents' insurance until age 26. It would allow states to opt out of essential health benefits and Obamacare's requirement that insurers charge sick and healthy people the same rates. It would also let insurers mark up premiums by 30 percent for those who have a lapse in insurance coverage of about two months or more. Insurers could charge older Americans up to five times more than younger Americans.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-healthcare-senate-idUSL1N1JK1R2"},

On Monday, a Texas border town and some of the state's biggest cities will ask a U.S. federal judge to halt the state law known as Senate Bill 4, arguing it is unconstitutional, violates human rights and illegally diverts police resources from fighting local crime to enforcing U.S. immigration law. The Republican-backed law in Texas, the U.S. state with the longest border with Mexico, takes effect on Sept. 1. It calls for jail time for police chiefs and sheriffs who fail to cooperate in U.S. immigration enforcement. It was the first such legislation approved by a state since Republican Donald Trump, who backs a crackdown on illegal immigration, became president in January. The U.S. Department of Justice filed a  statement of interest  with the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas in San Antonio, saying the law will facilitate cooperation between the state and federal authorities. “President Trump has made a commitment to keep America safe and to ensure cooperation with federal immigration laws,  Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement. Republican Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton welcomed the filing and said in a statement the Department of Justice plans to be involved in all court proceedings on SB 4. Plaintiffs including border town El Cenizo, the city of San Antonio and others, have said SB 4 is an extraordinary intrusion into the way they govern.  Under SB 4, local entities must enforce federal immigration law and must do so regardless of whether such enforcement will divert resources away from more pressing police needs,  they said in court filings. The law allows police to ask about immigration status during a lawful detention. Supporters have said immigrants who do not break the law have nothing to fear. Critics contend it allows police to detain people for up to 48 hours for immigration checks, even for minor infractions such as jay-walking.

Trump,Kristine Grow,USA,HEALTHCARE/INSURERS,Americas,United States","sector":"","content":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Health insurers are concerned about the U.S. Senate's plans to cut the Medicaid program for the poor and the impact such a move would have on state governments, the industry's largest lobbyist said on Friday. Republicans in the U.S. Senate on Thursday unveiled a draft bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare. The bill would replace its individual insurance coverage with new subsidies and requirements and cut federal funding for Medicaid. Hospital groups came out against the bill on Thursday. The legislation includes changes health insurers had been seeking, including tens of billions of dollars to help stabilize the individual insurance market during a transition year and the ability to charge older members more. But it repeals the individual mandate requiring people to buy health insurance without creating incentives for Americans to stay in their plans. In addition, the proposed changes to Medicaid financing for people who were newly covered under Obamacare and those in the standard Medicaid program are dramatic. That program is jointly funded by the states and the federal government.  We're worried about the burden it creates for the states,  Kristine Grow, spokeswoman at America's Health Insurance Plans (AHIP), said on Friday. The lobbying group is waiting to see the analysis of the bill's impact on spending and insurance coverage from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, expected next week. AHIP represents Anthem Inc, one of the largest sellers of health insurance on the Obamacare exchanges, and Cigna Corp, among others. Anthem has decided to leave the individual market in three of the 14 states where it sells Blue Cross Blue Shield plans, while Cigna is still weighing its decision. Molina Healthcare Inc, which has more than 1 million customers in Obamacare plans, said in a statement that dropping the individual mandate with no replacement provision will lead healthy people to forgo coverage and thus drive up premium rates. The U.S. House of Representatives' version of the Obamcare repeal bill includes a provision in which customers must maintain coverage or pay more, but Democrats argued that conflicted with Republican President Donald Trump's promise to keep the guaranteed insurance provision of Obamacare. Molina also said that the bill's proposal to tie cost-sharing subsidies to the lowest-level  bronze -rated healthcare plans will make coverage less affordable, not more, by raising customers' out-of-pocket costs. Under Obamacare, these subsidies are tied to the mid-range  silver -rated plans.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-healthcare-insurers-idUSL1N1JK1PX"},

Jassim Saif Al Sulaiti told Reuters the Gulf state was pushing to  get more routes for Qatar  and wants the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) to open international air routes over Gulf waters currently managed by the United Arab Emirates. The UAE is among four countries, including Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Egypt, that have closed their airspace to Qatar, forcing state-owned Qatar Airways to fly longer, more expensive routes. The four Arab states that imposed a boycott on Qatar have issued an ultimatum to Doha to close Al Jazeera television, curb ties with Iran, shut a Turkish base and pay reparations. It appears compliance would be difficult with the far-reaching demands. A decision on Friday by the Montreal-headquartered ICAO to hold the briefing next week follows concerns by Qatar Airways chief executive Akbar Al-Baker, who recently suggested the U.N agency was not working quickly enough to resolve the dispute. By contrast, Al Sulaiti said he trusted ICAO to find a solution to the dispute, and  take action very quickly.  ICAO's 36-state governing council can act to settle the overflights row presented by Qatar, but such interventions are rare and time-consuming because the specialized UN agency usually negotiates disputes diplomatically through consensus. ICAO cannot impose rules on states, but regulators from its 191-member countries almost always adopt and enforce its international aviation standards. Qatar has asked ICAO to use a dispute resolution mechanism in the Chicago Convention, a 1944 treaty that created the agency and set rules for international aviation. Article 84 says that if two states cannot resolve a dispute related to the convention through negotiation, one can ask the council to settle it, although the process is long. It took years to resolve a dispute in the late 1990s between Cuba and the United States, which would not allow Cuban carriers to fly through U.S. airspace on the way to Canada because of Washington's economic embargo on Cuba, said Armand de Mestral, a professor emeritus of international law at McGill University. Cuba was eventually allowed to resume flights with restrictions, a precedent that would bolster Qatar's case, he said.

Ng Lap Seng, 69, has pleaded not guilty to charges he paid hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes. The Chinese national, who was once linked to a Democratic fundraising scandal when Bill Clinton was U.S. president, is one of at least seven people charged since 2015 in the U.N.-related federal corruption probe. Jury selection is set to begin before U.S. District Judge Vernon Broderick in Manhattan. A trial could last several weeks. Prosecutors said Ng paid more than $500,000 in bribes to John Ashe, a former U.N. General Assembly president and ambassador from Antigua and Barbuda, and bribed Francis Lorenzo, a former deputy U.N. ambassador from the Dominican Republic. In exchange, Ng hoped the diplomats would provide U.N. support to help the Sun Kian Ip Group founder build the conference center, prosecutors said. The center was never built. Ashe was also criminally charged, but died at home last June after dropping a barbell on his neck. Lorenzo has pleaded guilty to bribery and money laundering and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors. Three other defendants have also pleaded guilty. Defense lawyers have argued that Ng's prosecution was politically motivated, to help the U.S. government check China's influence over developing countries that might have used the conference center as a permanent meeting venue. Ng's businesses also include apparel and casinos, and he has sat on the Chinese government's Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. In 1998, a U.S. Senate report said he had from 1994 to 1996 funneled hundreds of thousands of dollars through an Arkansas restaurateur to the Democratic National Committee as it worked to re-elect Clinton, who knew the restaurateur. Ng was not charged in the matter, known as  Chinagate,  and Broderick has said prosecutors may not discuss it at trial. Ng was arrested in September 2015.

The value of the dollar's net long position rose to $7.82 billion in the week ended June 20, from $6.48 billion the previous week. The previous week's net long dollar position was the lowest since the third week of August last year. Last week's interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve along with its hawkish statement have spurred speculators buy back dollars again. Influential New York Fed President William Dudley also added to the hawkish tone on Monday, saying U.S. inflation is a bit low but should rebound alongside wages as the labor market continues to improve. That affirms the Fed's message that a recent patch of weak data is unlikely to derail plans to keep raising interest rates.  Since last week's FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) decision, the dollar has begun to stage a more meaningful rebound after having been heavily pressured for more than a month,  said James Chen, head of research, at Forex.com in Bedminster, New Jersey.  The dollar's latest attempt at a rebound has translated into what appears to be a rough topping pattern for euro/dollar.  The dollar index though was still down 4.8 percent on the year. Euro net longs, meanwhile, fell to a one-month low after hitting a more than six-year high the previous week, CFTC data showed. This week, euro net longs fell to 44,852 contracts, from 79,053 the previous week. Analysts said the euro has been a casualty of recent dollar optimism. While the data and overall performance of the euro zone's private sector economy remain robust, the latest fall in manufacturing sector data along with evidence that firms cut prices again in June could prompt the European Central Bank to delay reducing monetary stimulus.   Such a scenario would likely limit some of the euro's gains going forward,  said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington. The Reuters calculation for the aggregate U.S. dollar position is derived from net positions of International Monetary Market speculators in the yen, euro, British pound, Swiss franc and Canadian and Australian dollars.

The value of the dollar's net long position rose to $7.82 billion in the week ended June 20, from $6.48 billion the previous week. The previous week's net long dollar position was the lowest since the third week of August last year. Last week's interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve along with its hawkish statement have spurred speculators buy back dollars again. Influential New York Fed President William Dudley also added to the hawkish tone on Monday, saying U.S. inflation is a bit low but should rebound alongside wages as the labor market continues to improve. That affirms the Fed's message that a recent patch of weak data is unlikely to derail plans to keep raising interest rates.  Since last week's FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) decision, the dollar has begun to stage a more meaningful rebound after having been heavily pressured for more than a month,  said James Chen, head of research, at Forex.com in Bedminster, New Jersey.  The dollar's latest attempt at a rebound has translated into what appears to be a rough topping pattern for euro/dollar.  The dollar index though was still down 4.8 percent on the year. Euro net longs, meanwhile, fell to a one-month low after hitting a more than six-year high the previous week, CFTC data showed. This week, euro net longs fell to 44,852 contracts, from 79,053 the previous week. Analysts said the euro has been a casualty of recent dollar optimism. While the data and overall performance of the euro zone's private sector economy remain robust, the latest fall in manufacturing sector data along with evidence that firms cut prices again in June could prompt the European Central Bank to delay reducing monetary stimulus.   Such a scenario would likely limit some of the euro's gains going forward,  said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington. The Reuters calculation for the aggregate U.S. dollar position is derived from net positions of International Monetary Market speculators in the yen, euro, British pound, Swiss franc and Canadian and Australian dollars.

The annual inflation rate cooled to 1.3 percent in May, below forecasts for 1.5 percent, pushing it further away from the Bank of Canada's 2 percent target. The central bank's three measures of core inflation remained subdued.                       It is going to be very difficult for the Bank (of Canada) to hike as soon as next month when you still haven't carved out a bottom on inflation,  said Derek Holt, head of capital markets economics at Scotiabank.     Chances of a hike in July fell to just 22 percent from one-in-three before the inflation report, data from the overnight index swaps market showed.                The Bank of Canada's top two officials last week said that looser monetary policies put in place in 2015 had largely done their work, and the bank would assess whether rates must remain at near-record lows.                  Analysts expect policymakers to stay hawkish amid concern that rates have been low too long.                   At 4 p.m. EDT (2000 GMT), the Canadian dollar          was trading at C$1.3267 to the greenback, or 75.37 U.S. cents, down 0.2 percent. It traded in a range of C$1.3211 to C$1.3307     For the week, the loonie lost 0.4 percent.     The impact of the weaker inflation data on the currency was tempered by a rally in crude oil, said Karl Schamotta, director of global markets strategy at Cambridge Global Payments.      Prices of oil, one of Canada's major exports, crept up from a 10-month low earlier this week. U.S. crude oil futures        settled 27 cents higher at $43.01 a barrel.     Speculators cut bearish bets on the Canadian dollar for a fourth straight week, data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission and Reuters calculations showed. Canadian dollar net short positions fell to 82,881 contracts as of June 20 from 88,595 a week earlier.     Canadian government bond prices were higher across a steeper yield curve, with the two-year            up 7 Canadian cents to yield 0.898 percent and the 10-year             rising 19 Canadian cents to yield 1.479 percent.     The two-year yield fell 3.9 basis points further below its U.S. equivalent to a spread of -44.7 basis points, as Canadian bonds outperformed. On Thursday, the spread touched its narrowest in nearly four months at -40.8 basis points.

Rutte told reporters his liberal VVD party will return to the negotiating table next week with the centrist Democrats 66, Christian Democratic CDA and the conservative Christian Union. Previous discussions between the same parties broke down after only hours due to a disagreement between CU and D66 over plans by the latter to expand the euthanasia law. Rutte said on Friday he was confident that this attempt, the third in as many months, will ultimately lead to a deal.  Together we have concluded that we are looking forward to these talks,  he said.  Immigration was the leading theme in the March 15 vote and scuppered the first coalition talks with the Green Left party. Earlier discussions between D66 and CU last month fell apart when CU leader Gert-Jan Segers said  a miracle  would be needed to iron out differences with D66. Before the elections, Segers labeled D66's proposal to broaden euthanasia from the terminally ill to people who feel their lives have been  fulfilled  as a breaking point. D66 leader Alexander Pechtold had called a coalition with the CU  undesirable .     The tiny CU holds only five out of 150 seats in parliament, but can make tough demands as kingmaker in the cabinet formation, since it is the last viable candidate to form a majority government with Rutte’s center-right VVD, after the far right party of Geert Wilders was ruled out by all major parties. The formation process has already past the post-war average of 88 days, and will become the longest since 1977 if talks stretch another month, which looks likely, assuming that D66 and CU will still need some time to find common ground.  The long wait for leadership has not gone unnoticed on the financial markets. Dutch government bonds, which boast among the top credit ratings in the world, have come under slight pressure recently, narrowing the spread between Dutch and lower-rated Belgian loans.      Ultimately, a political compromise, rather than undesirable and snap elections, appears all but certain, political historian and cabinet formation expert Carla van Baalen said.  Another possibility, she said, is a minority government, but that would mean having to seek partners to usher difficult legislation through the two houses of parliament.     New elections are on  nobody’s mind,  Van Baalen said.  We have seen gridlock before, long formations are part of Dutch culture. Although nobody is ever satisfied with the process, at some point a new cabinet always arrives.

Emirates Team New Zealand are seeking to wrest the cup from holders Oracle Team USA and with it the rights to decide when the event is next held, its timing and the type of boats used. This is all dictated by the ancient  Deed of Gift  which stipulates the trophy first won in 1851 by the U.S. schooner  America  was to be  a perpetual challenge cup for friendly competition between nations  and allows the winner to take all. However, the history of the cup has been anything but friendly at times, riddled with costly legal feuds, bitter personal battles and a stop-start reputation which has made it  hard to attract tens of millions of dollars needed in sponsorship and broadcasters willing to pay for rights.  From a sponsor's perspective, you don't have any certainty at all ... the defender decides virtually everything,  Jaguar Land Rover's [TAMOJL.UL] Experiential Marketing Director Mark Cameron said on Friday of the firm's support for Britain's Land Rover BAR team, led by British sailor Ben Ainslie. That could all change if the U.S. holders are able to turn around a 3-0 Kiwi lead in the first-to-seven competition on Bermuda's Great Sound when racing resumes this weekend. The team led by Oracle boss Larry Ellison signed up to a  framework agreement  with four of the other challengers this year which would mean the cup being held every two years in foiling catamarans as in Bermuda and a series of match races along the lines of Formula One around the world. This would please many sponsors, but not everyone liked the idea with some saying it was not true to the spirit of the cup and New Zealand boycotted the agreement. The New Zealand camp have not said so far what they will do if they win the cup back. Whose Cup Is It Anyway? Bermuda offered big financial incentives to have the America's Cup held on the small mid-Atlantic island and is keen to make sure that it gets repeat business. Painted on bus shelters along the island's narrow, winding roads is the official slogan  America's Cup, Bermuda's Legacy, Our Moment , with posters depicting a smiling boy from the island saying  America's Cup is Zico's Cup . But not everyone agrees, with  America's Cup is Larry's (Ellison's) Cup  in graffiti on one bus stop. If the U.S. team manage to keep the cup, there is speculation among other teams that the 36th edition could end up in Chicago rather than Bermuda, with races in places including Britain, France, Japan and Sweden.  But if the Kiwis win, the expectation is that it will move to Auckland, although there are also some suggestions that it could also be held in Dubai, where the main New Zealand sponsor Emirates Airline [EMIRA.UL] is based. While an Auckland cup would be more expensive for some sponsors and create challenges for televising the event in some countries, sponsors such as Land Rover which supports Britain's BAR team do not see it as a deal breaker.  We are clear that we want to compete in the next America's Cup,  Land Rover's Cameron said, adding that his preference was for it to be governed by the framework agreement, with an established class of boats and a  World Series  racing circuit.  We would have to see the details ... but on the basis of location its not a game changer. We would be competing in Auckland,  Cameron told Reuters by telephone.

The group launched its Making Democracy Work for Everyone app a month after it reported a 44 percent surge in the number of hate crimes reported by U.S. Muslims last year. Concerned that the 260 hate crimes CAIR learned of last year represent just a fraction of the actual total, the group intends the app to increase reporting.  In a moment of trauma, you're not thinking that I need to go online and enter something, but your phone will always be in your hand,  said Corey Saylor, who runs the group's anti-Islamophobia efforts. The application allows a user to file a description of an alleged incident, which CAIR staff will then investigate. If the group concludes the incident was the result religious bias, it will include it in its reporting, and if it believes the incident was criminal, it will share the details with local police. The app offers advice about what rights are protected by the U.S. Constitution and contains contact information for CAIR's national headquarters in Washington and chapters nationwide. The group this year resumed tracking anti-Muslim incidents, following a surge in bias cases last year. While the group saw an increase in anti-Muslim incidents prior to Donald Trump's stunning rise in last year's presidential primaries and November election victory, it said the acceleration in bias incidents was due in part to Trump's focus on militant Islamist groups and anti-immigrant rhetoric. Trump has said his policies do not reflect religious discrimination but rather efforts to improve national security, following a series of attacks. It is not the first time a U.S. advocacy group has used an app to try to track bias incidents. The Sikh Coalition Organization launched a similar app in 2012 to report bias incidents in U.S. airports.

The long-term ratings on the region's senior unsecured bonds have also been affirmed at 'A-'. The affirmation reflects the continuing high financial autonomy of VdA due to its special status. This underpins the region's sound budgetary performance, including a balanced health care sector, despite transitory pressures from revised revenue attribution as defined by the national government. The affirmation also reflects VdA's robust debt ratios, solid liquidity, prudent management and wealthy but small economy. The Stable Outlook factors in our expectation that VdA will maintain unchanged special status of autonomy and solid budgetary performance over the medium term. KEY RATING DRIVERS Autonomy Underpins Ratings: VdA is eligible to be rated above the sovereign (BBB/Stable) by virtue of its institutional strength and high financial autonomy. VdA's constitutionally granted special status entitles the region to receive 100% of major national taxes (PIT, CIT and VAT). The special status underpins the region's tax revenue resilience and limits dependence on state transfers, allowing the region to maintain solid budgetary performance while coping with the pressures stemming from Italy's public finances consolidation.  The latter includes changed tax attributions leading to a nearly EUR140 million annual reduction in 2015-2017 compared with 2014 levels and contributions to national budget consolidation averaging EUR200 million annually until 2017. The latter will be reduced by 70% from 2018 onwards, more than offsetting declining revenue. Fitch believes that the two-notch buffer above the 'BBB' sovereign rating (three notches are the maximum allowed by Fitch criteria) captures potential intervention by the state and the subsequent risk of weakening predictability of inter-governmental relations. Robust Operating Performance: Fitch expects VdA will maintain healthy financial flexibility through economic cycles via expenditure control and resilient revenue, benefitting from an additional 5% fiscal leeway. Last year results showed a 14% operating margin (12% in 2015), still down from 18% in 2013-2014, due to the contribution to national budget consolidation, revised  attribution of excise duties on beer and energy and import duties, and decreasing transfers that are only partially compensated by a tight grip on operating costs. From 2018, due to a bilateral agreement on lower contributions to the national government, we expect operating margin to return to 2014 levels, which will provide the region with resources to self-fund part of its capex. The healthcare sector, absorbing less than 25% of operating revenue, is expected to remain balanced over the medium term with high quality standards, due to increasing regional transfers and structure rationalisation. Sustainable Risk: The region successfully reduced its debt stock to EUR175 million at end-2016 from EUR342 million in 2011, when net of the sinking fund for bullet bonds (accounting for EUR443 million) and EUR3.8 million debt serviced by the state. Despite the decision to self-fund its investment plan through current surpluses, reserves and through its development company Finaosta, Fitch's central scenario assumes VdA's direct debt to remain at around EUR200 million, or less than 20% of the budget, over the medium term, with new debt offsetting principal repayment. Even including Finaosta's full financial debt of EUR370 million (EUR175 million drawn at end-2016), in Fitch's view, VdA's overall risk at below 50% of operating revenue does not significantly affect the region's creditworthiness. Its robust cash-generating capacity, supported by excellent tax collection should allow liquidity to remain sound in 2017-2019. This is broadly in line with the region's average cash balance of EUR127 million in 2014-2016, covering debt servicing by more than 2x. Prudent Management: VdA maintains a stable and prudent budgetary policy aimed at reducing financial debt and maintaining a tight grip on costs. Fitch expects VdA to increase investment spending to EUR450 million in 2017-2019 from about EUR300 million in 2014-2016 to stimulate the regional economy while maintaining a balanced budget. Investment will focus on transportation, schools, buildings, agriculture, and tourism activities. VdA's EUR120 million fund balance deficit (EUR200 million fund balance surplus in 2015) posted in 2016 was driven by an extraordinary revision and reallocation of payables and receivables. Fitch expects VdA to reverse the deficit well ahead of the 30-year deadline allowed by the national government, due to its solid budgetary performance. Wealthy but Small Economy: Located in the north-west of Italy, VdA is among the smaller regions, with 127,000 inhabitants and a GDP of about EUR4 billion. However, VdA's GDP per capita, at nearly 30% above the EU average, makes the region one of the wealthiest in Italy and Europe. The economy is driven by tourism and industry, while exports of metals, machinery and beverage, after having declined in 2016, are recovering. Stable employment, at around 66% and above the national average (57%), contributes to the economy's resilience and supports the regional tax base. RATING SENSITIVITIES Rating actions on Italy will be mirrored in VdA's ratings.  This is because VdA's IDRs move in tandem with those of Italy due to the compression from the sovereign ratings on the region's standalone profile. A downgrade could be triggered by unfavourable changes in the region's statute of autonomy. A prolonged economic downturn leading to a sharp deterioration of the operating margin on a sustained basis could also result in a downgrade of VdA's ratings.

The deal would be the first such purchase by a country that is not a member of the NATO alliance. Such a sale of sensitive military hardware must be authorized by the State Department before being sent to Congress for review.

The Outlook is Stable. The 'BBB+' rating reflects the high financial autonomy of Sardinia due to its special status, underpinning the region's sound budgetary performance. The affirmation also reflects our expectation that the region's direct debt, although increasing, will remain low, with solid debt ratios and a satisfactory liquidity position. The affirmation further takes into account Sardinia's expected progressive economic recovery supporting the regional tax base. KEY RATING DRIVERS Autonomy Underpins Ratings: Sardinia is rated above the Italian sovereign (BBB/Stable), as its financial and fiscal autonomy entitles the region to receive fixed shares of major national taxes, ranging from 70% of personal income tax (PIT) and car tax, to 90% of VAT. Its constitutionally protected special autonomous status underpins the region's tax resilience, shielding the revenue structure from the risk of unilateral interference from the state, including risks of annual budgetary appropriations. However, stressed sovereign finances mean Sardinia, as with other regions, is a contributor to Italy's consolidation efforts (EUR680 million annually). Fitch therefore limits the uplift above the sovereign rating to one notch to capture potential intervention by the state and the subsequent risk of weakening predictability of inter-governmental relations. Solid Fiscal Performance: According to preliminary figures, Sardinia posted an operating margin of 9% of revenue in 2016, when adjusted by Fitch for non-recurrent revenue and arrears from the national government. Fitch expects Sardinia to post a stable operating balance of 7%-8% in 2017-2019, or EUR500 million, although recovered credits from the state will be reduced. The stabilisation will be supported by the region's robust tax base, including an additional EUR100 million attribution from the national government as a share of principal taxes, and tighter cost control partly offsetting declining fees and transfers. We estimate Sardinia's flexibility accounts for 5% of operating revenue. Fitch estimates regional investments of about EUR3 billion in 2017-2019, mostly financed by EU funds and capital transfers. In line with regional policies aimed at revitalising economy, investments will focus on hospitals, the environment, hydro-geological works and roads. Sustainable Risks, Healthy Liquidity: Sardinia's stock of direct debt at end-2016 remained at EUR1.1 billion, excluding EUR215 million subsidised loans to pay down commercial liabilities, and EUR14 million debt charged to the state. Fitch expects the regional stock of debt, including subsidised loans, to rise towards EUR1.6 billion by 2019, or around a moderate 25% of revenue (21% in 2016), since new debt will exceed principal repayment to finance investments and liabilities. The agency forecasts a payback ratio (debt coverage by the current balance) at less than four years, below the average life of debt of 12 years. The region's cash position declined to EUR60 million at end-2016 from EUR370 million at end-2015, due to accelerated payments to reduce commercial liabilities. We expect liquidity will remain satisfactory over the medium term, covering 1x debt servicing requirements. Slow Economic Recovery: With a GDP per capita at 75% of the EU average and the unemployment rate still above the national level (17.3% in 2016 versus 11.7% nationally), Sardinia's socio-economic profile remains weaker than the national average. Fitch expects slight GDP improvement in 2017, mainly driven by tourism in addition to industry and commerce, offsetting decreasing exports in oil and mining products. Projects of new public infrastructures as well as tax relief and bureaucratic simplifications will be key to revitalising the region's long-term economy and supporting the regional tax base. Active Management Overcomes Challenges: The healthcare sector continued to post a deficit of EUR290 million in 2016 (EUR320 million deficit in 2015), mainly due to high pharmaceutical costs and inefficient hospitals structures. The regional administration aims to reverse the sector deficit during 2017-2019 through cost restraint and a rationalisation of structures and processes. The regional administration has continued to express its commitment to streamline operating costs, while revitalising the local economy to strengthen revenue. Fitch will continue to monitor the recovery of the region's EUR1.2 billion fund balance deficit, including EUR400 million loans not yet drawn down to pay off liabilities, by 2035. RATING SENSITIVITIES Rating actions on Italy will be mirrored in Sardinia's ratings. This is because Sardinia's IDRs move in tandem with those of Italy due to the compression from the sovereign ratings on the region's standalone profile A prolonged economic downturn or economic shock with an unemployment rate above 20% that jeopardises tax revenue generation could result in a downgrade of Sardinia. A structural deterioration of the adjusted operating margin significantly to below 6% over the medium term, with debt rising sharply above 50% of revenue could also lead to a downgrade.

The issue ratings on Belgium's senior unsecured foreign- and local-currency bonds are also affirmed at 'AA-'. The Country Ceiling is affirmed at 'AAA' and the Short-Term Foreign-Currency and Local Currency IDRs at 'F1+'. The issue ratings on Belgium's short-term debt are also affirmed at 'F1+'. KEY RATING DRIVERS Belgium's ratings balance the government's high public debt burden (general government debt was 106% of GDP in 2016, the highest in the 'AA' peer category and compared with a median of 40%)  against the sovereign's substantial net external creditor position, strong governance indicators, high income per capita and macroeconomic stability. Following recent fiscal slippage with respect to published targets, the general government deficit outturn for 2016, at 2.6% of GDP, was in line with the 2016 Stability Programme and broadly unchanged from 2015. This generally favourable outturn was underpinned by expenditure restraint that offset a decline in revenue as a share of GDP (reflecting a decline in personal direct taxes due to 'tax shift' measures, not fully offset by indirect tax increases). Fitch expects the deficit to narrow further this year, to 1.9% of GDP, on lower interest payments (accounting for almost half of the decline), 1.6% in 2018 and 1.5% by 2019. The Belgian government's current Stability Programme envisages a consolidation in structural terms of around 2pp of GDP over the period 2017-2019, in line with its medium-term objective of achieving a structural balance by 2019. Under the authorities' plans, the consolidation effort is to be concentrated at the federal government (central government) level. This should help reduce execution risks given the decentralised nature of the Belgian political system. Our fiscal projections would be consistent with a modest decline in the general government debt-to-GDP ratio to 103.8% by 2019 from 106% currently. Sovereign refinancing risk is low, due to a long average debt maturity of 8.7 years (versus a 'AA' peer median of around 6.5 years), and a low average weighted bond yield of 2.4%. Recent economic data point to an upturn in economic activity. While real GDP growth slowed to 1.2% in 2016 (compared with 1.5% in 2015), activity has recently picked up, with real GDP rising 0.6% on a seasonally adjusted quarterly basis in 1Q17. We expect GDP growth to pick up to 1.6% for the full year, underpinned by stronger private consumption and investment. Growth should remain steady in 2018, before declining slightly to around 1.3% in 2019, in line with our assumptions on GDP growth over the medium term. Improved growth prospects have been accompanied by a pick-up in the labour market. Employment growth averaged 1.3% on an annual basis in 2016 and has risen further since, while unemployment fell to 7.2% in 4Q16 from 8.6% a year earlier. High inflation poses a risk to Belgium's competitiveness. Consumer price inflation averaged 1.8% in 2016, much higher than the rates seen in neighbouring countries on account of rising prices of certain services. Inflation has picked up further this year, averaging 2.7% in the first five months of 2017. There is a risk that higher inflation could lead to price and wage indexation, pushing up labour costs with negative consequences for companies' competitiveness. Mitigating this risk is a reform of the wage negotiation mechanism introduced by the government that aims to limit the divergence of labour costs in Belgium relative to its neighbours. Social partners have already taken this reform into account and have agreed to limits on increases in real wages of 1.1% over the next two years. House prices have been rising steadily since the global financial crisis, contributing to a rise in household indebtedness - lending to households is increasing at an annual rate of around 7.5%. Despite the increase, household debt, at 60% of GDP at end-2016, was in line with the euro area average. Belgium has a score of '2' on Fitch's Macro-Prudential Risk Indicator (MPI), reflecting a credit/GDP ratio significantly above trend and pointing to moderate vulnerability. At the same time, Belgian households' net wealth position is very strong (EUR1.1 trillion at end-2016, around 2.5x nominal GDP), mitigating risks to financial stability. SOVEREIGN RATING MODEL (SRM) and QUALITATIVE OVERLAY (QO) Fitch's proprietary SRM assigns Belgium a score equivalent to a rating of 'AA-' on the Long-Term Foreign Currency IDR scale. Fitch's sovereign rating committee adjusted the output from the SRM to arrive at the final Long-Term Foreign Currency IDR by applying its QO, relative to rated peers, as follows: - Public finances: -1 notch, to reflect high gross general government debt/GDP and sizeable contingent liabilities. The SRM is estimated on the basis of a linear approach to debt/GDP and does not capture the higher risk at high levels of debt/GDP. - External finances: +1 notch, to reflect Belgium's large net external creditor position, which is not captured by the SRM. Fitch's SRM is the agency's proprietary multiple regression rating model that employs 18 variables based on three year-centred averages, including one year of forecasts, to produce a score equivalent to a Long-Term Foreign Currency IDR. Fitch's QO is a forward-looking qualitative framework designed to allow for adjustment to the SRM output to assign the final rating, reflecting factors within our criteria that are not fully quantifiable and/or not fully reflected in the SRM. RATING SENSITIVITIES The Outlook is Stable, which means Fitch does not expect developments with a high likelihood of leading to a rating change. However, the main factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to a positive rating action, are: - A track record of fiscal restraint placing public debt/GDP on a sustained downward trajectory; - Strengthening medium-term economic growth prospects, particularly if related to an improvement in competitiveness. Future developments that could individually or collectively, result in a negative rating action include: -Larger fiscal deficits resulting in an increase in the public debt/GDP ratio; -Worsening of Belgium's medium-term growth prospects, for example due to a worsening in competitiveness. KEY ASSUMPTIONS In its debt sensitivity analysis, Fitch assumes a primary surplus averaging 0.8% of GDP over the next 10 years, trend real GDP growth averaging 1.4%, an average effective interest rate of 2.1% and GDP deflator of 1.9%. Based on these assumptions, the debt/GDP ratio would decline to 90% by 2026.

Eddie Bauer has hired Guggenheim Partners LLC and Financo LLC to explore its options, the people said. They said the company is not currently pursuing a debt restructuring, although it is seeking relief from a $225 million term loan due in 2020 and $200 million revolving credit line that comes due in 2019. The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Golden Gate Capital declined to comment, while Eddie Bauer, Guggenheim and Financo did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Changing consumer tastes and a boom in internet shopping have prompted upheaval in the retail sector. High-end retailers Neiman Marcus Group Ltd LLC and J. Crew Group Inc have both retained advisors to slash their debt loads. Others including Rue21 Inc and Gymboree Corp have filed for bankruptcy.  Bellevue, Washington-based Eddie Bauer, with about 370 stores in the United States and Canada, was acquired out of bankruptcy by buyout firm Golden Gate Capital in 2009 with a cash bid of $286 million.  Eddie Bauer, founded almost 100 years ago, was an acquisition target before. In 2014, men's apparel retailer Jos A. Bank planned to acquire Eddie Bauer for $825 million in an attempt to stay independent in the face of a bid from rival Men's Wearhouse Inc. The bid for Eddie Bauer ended when Men's Wearhouse succeeded in acquiring Jos A. Bank. Eddie Bauer opened a flagship store on Fifth Avenue in New York City near Union Square in New York City about two years ago, in an attempted turnaround that also includes plans to launch a celebrity stylist-designed line in the fall. Same-store sales at Eddie Bauer were up 8 percent for the holiday period between Black Friday and New Year's Eve, and are up 6 percent year-to-date, according to one of the sources. Over the 12 months to April 1, however, Eddie Bauer has seen revenue declines and lower gross margins, according to credit ratings agency Moody's Investors Service Inc. Both Moody's and Standard & Poor's downgraded Eddie Bauer's debt recently, warning that the brand may have to rely on borrowings to fund working capital needs and interest expense.

The group launched its Making Democracy Work for Everyone app a month after it reported a 44 percent surge in the number of hate crimes reported by U.S. Muslims last year. Concerned that the 260 hate crimes CAIR learned of last year represent just a fraction of the actual total, the group intends the app to increase reporting.  In a moment of trauma, you're not thinking that I need to go online and enter something, but your phone will always be in your hand,  said Corey Saylor, who runs the group's anti-Islamophobia efforts. The application allows a user to file a description of an alleged incident, which CAIR staff will then investigate. If the group concludes the incident was the result religious bias, it will include it in its reporting, and if it believes the incident was criminal, it will share the details with local police. The app offers advice about what rights are protected by the U.S. Constitution and contains contact information for CAIR's national headquarters in Washington and chapters nationwide. The group this year resumed tracking anti-Muslim incidents, following a surge in bias cases last year. While the group saw an increase in anti-Muslim incidents prior to Donald Trump's stunning rise in last year's presidential primaries and November election victory, it said the acceleration in bias incidents was due in part to Trump's focus on militant Islamist groups and anti-immigrant rhetoric. Trump has said his policies do not reflect religious discrimination but rather efforts to improve national security, following a series of attacks. It is not the first time a U.S. advocacy group has used an app to try to track bias incidents. The Sikh Coalition Organization launched a similar app in 2012 to report bias incidents in U.S. airports.

Investment firms Sound Point Capital, Cerberus, Attestor and Varde submitted a rescue proposal for Banca Popolare di Vicenza and Veneto Banca on May 30, said the sources, who declined to be named as the matter is confidential. They picked Deutsche Bank to work on the deal, partly due to its expertise with troubled Greek banks. However the proposal, which was subject to due diligence, was not followed up on by Rome and recent attempts made by the funds to contact the Italian Treasury and restate their interest in the deal went unanswered.  The last conversation with the Treasury was 10 days ago, the sources said, but provided no clarity on whether the funds could play a role. The government is expected to start liquidation proceedings for the two banks on Friday or Saturday, with retail bank Intesa Sanpaolo (ISP.MI) set to buy their good assets for 1 euro. The state is likely to foot the bulk of the bill, using taxpayers' money to take on the lenders' soured debt. The consortium led by U.S. hedge fund Sound Point Capital - who has former Goldman Sachs chairman Stephen Friedman as a limited partner - offered to pump in an overall 1.6 billion euros of capital.  Their proposal envisaged about 1.3 billion euros going into new tier one and tier two bonds that the banks would issue to them, and a further 300 million euros into their shares, the sources said.  The offer was briefly discussed with the Italian Treasury in early June but the funds never got a formal response, the sources said, adding recent reports of a possible deal with Intesa came as a surprise. The logo of Veneto Banca bank is seen in Venice, Italy, January 31 2016.Alessandro Bianchi/File PhotoIn mid-June the funds told the Treasury they had the flexibility to work on an alternative proposal and team up with Italian lenders Intesa and UniCredit (CRDI.MI), one of the sources said, in the event that the biggest Italian banks formed an investment vehicle and led the rescue of the Veneto banks.  But the Treasury ignored their interest, the source said. The Bank of Italy, Deutsche Bank and Sound Point Capital declined to comment while the Italian Treasury, the Veneto Banks, Cerberus, Attestor and Varde were not immediately available for comment. A Banca Popolare di Vicenza sign is seen in Rome, Italy, March 29, 2017.Alessandro BianchiAs part of the deal, the four funds were hoping to take a 15 percent stake in the two banks and control their governance, the sources said.   Having control of the governance and management team was a key point,  one source said, adding this might have put off the Treasury.  The four funds worked closely with Popolare Vicenza boss Fabrizio Viola, a former CEO of Monte dei Paschi, who would have played a leading role had the plan succeeded, the sources said. To proceed the four funds needed at least four weeks to carry out extensive due diligence on the banks' books whereas Rome was looking for a much faster solution. Italy has tried for weeks to prevent the two banks, which have a capital shortfall of 6.4 billion euros, from being wound down under European banking rules due to concerns senior bondholders and large depositors would be hit with heavy losses. However, Rome failed to convince other, healthier lenders, to stump up funds to salvage them.

The deal would be the first such purchase by a country that is not a member of the NATO alliance. Such a sale of sensitive military hardware must be authorized by the State Department before being sent to Congress for review.

Divisions have also surfaced within the ruling African National Congress (ANC) since President Jacob Zuma sacked his finance minister in March and are likely to keep emerging until the party elects a new leader in December. The central bank and Barclays Africa (BGAJ.J) have also asked for a court review of Public Protector Busi Mkhwebane's proposal to change the bank's primary mandate of maintaining currency and price stability to focus instead on growth.   Parliament believes that the remedial action (recommendation), which is binding in terms of the law, usurps the powers of the institution under the Constitution,  it said on its website. Mkhwebane made her proposal at a Pretoria news conference on Monday where she delivered her findings on an apartheid-era bailout of Barclays Africa. The bank has denied any wrongdoing. Her call threatens to further stain South Africa's image as an investor-friendly emerging market, coming less than a week after mines minister Mosebenzi spooked investors by raising the minimum threshold for black ownership of mining companies to 30 percent from 26 percent.  The row over the South African Reserve Bank has also highlighted divisions in the tripartite political alliance of the ruling ANC, the country's biggest union, Cosatu, and the South African Communist Party (SACP). Both the ANC and the SACP are opposed to constitutional changes aimed at altering the role of the central bank while Cosatu has backed calls for amendments. Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa said at a fundraising dinner for the SACP on Friday that suggestions the constitutional mandate of institutions such as the Reserve Bank should be changed must be viewed with concern.   They need to be approached with a comprehensive understanding of the contribution that such institutions make to the stability of our economy, and, hence, the contribution that such institutions make to our ability to fulfill our mandate for fundamental transformation,  he said.

I think it's fair to say that the security situation is extremely worrying as far as delivery of health services is concerned,  she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in a phone interview from the capital Bangui at the end of her visit. After more than four years of violence that have caused  extensive degradation  of health services, Central African Republic's new national plan aims to re-establish public health systems and infrastructure, the WHO said in a statement. The plan also seeks to bolster the fight against HIV/AIDS, which affects almost one in 20 people in the country, and improve treatment of epidemics such as cholera, measles and meningitis. Clashes between rival armed factions are cutting off humanitarian access to civilians most in need of help, while emboldened fighters are infiltrating camps for the displaced, aid agencies said on Thursday, despite militias signing a peace deal this week aimed at ending years of bloodshed. [nL8N1JJ4ET] Moeti's visit was limited to Bangui, one of the few parts of the country where the government still retains control.  There, tens of thousands of displaced people have been returning to their neighborhoods in recent months, after years sheltering in the city's mosques, churches, the airport and other makeshift camps.   When people are in these camps, the humanitarian organizations have (health and other) services provided, but when they go back home, I think the services are more precarious,  Moeti said.  This underlines the importance of this re-establishment plan and having it supported, so that these services are provided where people would normally be living.  Thousands have died in a conflict that broke out after mainly Muslim Seleka rebels seized power in 2013, provoking a backlash from Christian anti-balaka militias. Across the country of 5 million access to quality basic health services remains inadequate. Moeti also launched a program to reduce maternal and infant mortality by training and hiring more health workers, nurses, doctors, gynecologists and obstetricians. Central African Republic is one of the deadliest countries in the world for mothers, with 882 maternal deaths for every 100,000 live births, the WHO said.

On Tuesday, Rio Tinto said it had selected Yancoal (YAL.AX) to buy its Coal & Allied division in Australia for $2.45 billion. [L8N1JC3BL] That was $100 million lower than a previous counter-bid from Glencore, but Rio said it believed Yancoal's offer could be completed more quickly because it had regulatory approvals. Glencore said its latest offer, which includes a coal-linked royalty, was at least $225 million greater than Yancoal's proposal and it would pay the cash amount in full on completion with no deferred payments.  We believe the Glencore offer satisfies the criteria for a 'superior proposal': it delivers substantially greater value to Rio Tinto shareholders and low deal completion risk,  Glencore said in a statement. Rio Tinto confirmed it had received the new offer and said it would give it  appropriate consideration .  Depending on whether it accepts Glencore's revised offer, it said it would adjourn an annual general meeting scheduled for Tuesday and allow Yancoal two days to pursue a counter offer. Glencore shares closed 0.8 percent lower, while London-listed shares in Rio rose 0.5 percent.   Although subject to a limited number of regulatory approvals, Glencore said it was demonstrating its confidence it would get them with a $225 million deposit, which it will forfeit if the transaction does not go ahead. It has said it already has approval from Japan where the majority of the coal would be shipped. Glencore reiterated an earlier pledge it would ensure its net debt to EBITDA ratio was no greater than 2:1 by selling some assets should it complete the deal. It also said the offer would automatically lapse if Rio Tinto did not declare it to be the superior offer on June 26 and subsequently if a binding sales agreement is not clinched on July 5. Glencore has long sought to own Rio's Hunter Valley coal assets, which adjoin mines it already has, offering the possibility for synergies and blending coal to optimize value. Analysts say Rio has deep ties with China, the world's biggest commodity market, which it will not wish to damage, but Glencore's offer is clearly higher.

There were no breaks in the second set although Muller had to fend off two set points at 5-6, the first after turning around a rally Querrey had been in control of with a crafty lob and the second with an unreturnable serve. Muller, who cracked down 12 aces with a swinging serve that is tough to read, finished the job with a feathered drop volley.  I'm going to play semi-finals here for the first time tomorrow.

Divisions have also surfaced within the ruling African National Congress (ANC) since President Jacob Zuma sacked his finance minister in March and are likely to keep emerging until the party elects a new leader in December. The central bank and Barclays Africa (BGAJ.J) have also asked for a court review of Public Protector Busi Mkhwebane's proposal to change the bank's primary mandate of maintaining currency and price stability to focus instead on growth.   Parliament believes that the remedial action (recommendation), which is binding in terms of the law, usurps the powers of the institution under the Constitution,  it said on its website. Mkhwebane made her proposal at a Pretoria news conference on Monday where she delivered her findings on an apartheid-era bailout of Barclays Africa. The bank has denied any wrongdoing. Her call threatens to further stain South Africa's image as an investor-friendly emerging market, coming less than a week after mines minister Mosebenzi spooked investors by raising the minimum threshold for black ownership of mining companies to 30 percent from 26 percent.  The row over the South African Reserve Bank has also highlighted divisions in the tripartite political alliance of the ruling ANC, the country's biggest union, Cosatu, and the South African Communist Party (SACP). Both the ANC and the SACP are opposed to constitutional changes aimed at altering the role of the central bank while Cosatu has backed calls for amendments. Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa said at a fundraising dinner for the SACP on Friday that suggestions the constitutional mandate of institutions such as the Reserve Bank should be changed must be viewed with concern.   They need to be approached with a comprehensive understanding of the contribution that such institutions make to the stability of our economy, and, hence, the contribution that such institutions make to our ability to fulfill our mandate for fundamental transformation,  he said.

John Yarmuth, top Democrat on the U.S. House of Representatives Budget Committee, told Reuters there is bipartisan interest in raising the debt limit before August.  There is talk going on, there is leadership conversation about this,  said Yarmuth, who added that House Democrats do not plan to demand concessions from Republicans in exchange for supporting a debt limit increase. Unlike most countries, the U.S. government has a statutory limit on how much money it can borrow to cover the budget deficit that results from Washington spending more than it collects in taxes. Only Congress can raise that limit.  Related CoverageDemocrat sees bipartisan support for corporate tax reformThe Trump administration has warned the debt limit will need to be raised in the fall. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin last month moved the target deadline for action to September from October, saying tax receipts are coming in slower than expected. Senate Republicans remain in contact with the administration on the issue, but don't have further updates on their plans, a senior aide said. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi has said Democrats will support a  clean  debt-limit bill, free of conditions. Conservative Republicans in the House Freedom Caucus have traditionally voted against clean increases and have already indicated they would like to raise the debt limit less than requested by the Trump administration.

Raising the debt limit adds another obligation. Over the past decade, raising the limit went from a routine job to a politically charged negotiation. In 2011, under former Democratic President Barack Obama, Republicans began demanding concessions in exchange for their votes to raise the limit. Slideshow (2 Images)As a result, the nation twice went to the brink of busting the debt ceiling before an agreement could be reached. Yarmuth said Democrats are not opposed to attaching a debt ceiling increase to  bipartisan  legislation, but warned against adding  poison pills.   “I don't think our side wants to play games with this,” he said. Bipartisan discussions in the Senate on the debt limit have not begun, a leadership aide confirmed.

State-controlled Petrobras is now seeking a double coating on  risers,  or connections for flexible underwater pipelines, after it closed a $300 million contract with TechnipFMC a almost year ago to supply the equipment, she said. The cost for the change, which would be made through a contract addendum, is still being negotiated by Petrobras and TechnipFMC's Brazilian unit, she added. The talks follow two failures, which occurred in gas injection pipeline connections after the contract was signed. The problems, which occurred in Lula and Sapinhoá - Petrobras' top two producing fields in the so-called pre-salt region - led technicians to begin investigating the flaws and monitoring other pipeline connections in pre-salt areas.  Petrobras' production and technology development director, Roberto Moro, played down the probability of problems caused by the incidents. The risk of an environmental accident  is minimal and close to zero, because we are talking about gas risers rather than oil. There is also no risk to production,  Moro said in an interview. The situation underscores the challenges facing Petrobras as it seeks to ramp up output of pre-salt oil and gas, which has heavy carbon dioxide content, in deep waters. Pre-salt refers to deep-sea oil resources off Brazil's coast, trapped beneath a layer of mineral salts under the seabed. TechnipFMC declined to comment. Another Petrobras spokeswoman said the company had not released a statement about the riser issues when they occurred but informed authorities and reporters seeking information on the matter.  Specific Issue  Moro said the incidents were  a specific issue and no problem was detected at another riser, but we continue to monitor it.  There is no deadline for Petrobras and TechnipFMC to close negotiations over the contract addendum, the spokeswoman said, adding that TechnipFMC has hired specialists in carbon dioxide-related corrosion to investigate the failures. In both incidents, pieces of the deficient risers fell to the ocean floor and allowed sea water to leak into the pipes. The risers had been connected to the Cidade de Angra dos Reis platform system in the Lula field and the Cidade de São Paulo platform system in the Sapinhoá field     According to Moro, in both cases, the problem was caused by carbon dioxide-related corrosion, which is more common in risers that carry gas instead of oil.     The issues in gas injection pipelines linking the wells to the two platforms drove Petrobras to decide to reinforce the equipment that will be used in future pre-salt output. Pre-salt already accounts for almost half of oil and gas extraction in Brazil.     However, risers with double protection at the joints, to prevent further infiltration of seawater, will initially be used only in new operations, the first Petrobras spokeswoman said.

A number of Turkish media as well as Turkey's main Muslim religious authority, Diyanet, have poured scorn on the Ibn-Rushd-Goethe Mosque, founded by Seyran Ates, a 54-year-old female lawyer and women's rights campaigner of Turkish origin who does not wear a headscarf. The mosque, which uses the premises of a Protestant church, allows men and women to pray side by side instead of being segregated. Ates herself is the imam, in contravention of mainstream Muslim practice, which reserves the position for men. Diyanet said the mosque's practices  do not align with Islam's fundamental resources, principles of worship, methodology or experience of more than 14 centuries, and are experiments aimed at nothing more than depraving and ruining religion . Martin Schaefer, spokesman for the German Foreign Ministry, said Berlin was concerned by the statement.  I want to be very clear in rejecting all comments that clearly intend to deprive people in Germany of their right to freely exercise their religion and to limit the right to free expression of opinion,  Schaefer said. Germany, which is home to an estimated 4 million or more people of Turkish origin, is already at loggerheads with Turkey on numerous issues. FILE PHOTO: Seyran Ates, founder of the new liberal Ibn-Rushd-Goethe-Mosque, prays in Berlin, Germany, June 16, 2017.Hannibal Hanschke/File PhotoThey include the barring of Turkish politicians planning to campaign in Germany for a referendum expanding President Tayyip Erdogan's powers; Turkey's arrest of a German-Turkish journalist working for a German paper; and Turkey's refusal to let German parliamentarians visit an air force base hosting German planes. Schaefer said it was not for the government to determine how people practised their religion, and that it would protect freedom of worship just as it protected freedom of opinion and press freedom. Turkey's pro-government Sabah newspaper called the mosque's practices  the so-called prayer of the perverse . Diyanet linked the mosque to the network of U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom Turkey blames for last July's failed coup and refers to as the  Gulenist Terrorist Organization  or  FETO . Ates has denied any connection to Gulen. The Turkish pro-government broadcaster A Haber ran a headline that read:  The ugly face of FETO in Berlin . In a caption to a video story, A Haber also wrote:  The Gulenist Terrorist Organization has caused a scandal in Germany's city of Berlin ... How is it trampling the rules and morals of Islam at the so-called mosque it opened?  Gulen has condemned the coup attempt and denied any link to it.

The engineer's email was disclosed in a statement from Honda as part of its defense in a class action suit in Florida, where plaintiffs are seeking compensation for the lost value of vehicles due to defects in Takata air bag inflators. The inflators can explode with excessive force, launching metal shrapnel at passengers in cars and trucks. The inflators prompted the automotive industry's largest ever safety recall and have been linked to at least 16 deaths worldwide. Nine of the 11 U.S. deaths have been reported in 2001-2003 model Honda and Acura vehicles The engineer's July 18, 2013 email, originally written in Japanese and translated by Honda, is part of an exchange with a colleague at the automaker.  I am a witness in the dark who knows the truth about Takata's inflator recall,  the engineer, whose name is blacked out in Honda's statement, wrote in his email.  If I say something to NHTSA, it will cause a complete reversal in the auto industry which adopted Takata inflators,  added the engineer, who told his colleague he had been taken off air bag-related work by Honda because of his supposed inside knowledge. NHTSA is the acronym of the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. In a sworn affidavit filed with a federal court and dated June 1, 2017, the engineer acknowledged he had been mistaken, however.

I believed that the root cause of the October 16, 1999 rupture related to the root cause of the Takata inflator recalls,  the affidavit stated. Based on later findings by the NHTSA,  I now understand that I was incorrect and the root cause of the field events is not related to the root cause of the October 1999 rupture.

A rise in large-cap technology stocks, including Apple , Facebook and Microsoft, pushed up the S&P; 500 information technology sector 0.82 percent. Tech stocks had sold off sharply in the past two weeks on concerns over stretched valuations. Oil prices climbed about 1 percent, edging up from 10-month lows, but remained on course for its biggest first-half decline since the late 1990s as production cuts have failed to reduce oversupply. At current levels, the S&P; 500 energy index, down 15 percent so far this year, is on track to post its worst weekly decline in about 18 months. Sliding oil prices have added to concerns about the inflation outlook, which along with a flattening yield curve, could pose a challenge for the Federal Reserve to decide whether the economy was ready for another interest rate hike this year. The Fed should wait on any further rate increases until it is clear inflation is reliably heading to the central bank's 2 percent target, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said on Friday. At 12:51 p.m. ET (1651 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 18.35 points, or 0.09 percent, at 21,415.64, the S&P; 500 was up 5.97 points, or 0.24 percent, at 2,440.47. The Nasdaq Composite was up 27.33 points, or 0.44 percent, at 6,264.01. The laggards included the healthcare index and the financial index, down 0.24 percent and 0.27 percent.

However, the bill drew skepticism from the Democrats, who attacked the legislation as a callous giveaway to the rich that would leave millions without coverage.

Linder,Indu Mani,US,HEALTH,HOSPITALS,THERAPY,ANIMALS,Infectious Diseases,Alternative Health,Health / Medicine,Public Health,Science,Regulation,Clinical Medicine,Healthcare (TRBC),Communicable Diseases,Corporate Events","sector":"Life","content":"(Reuters Health) - Hospitals and other healthcare facilities don’t consistently follow guidelines to ensure the safety of therapy animals and the people they aim to help, according to a survey of U.S. hospitals, eldercare facilities, and therapy animal organizations.  While most facilities allowed therapy animals to visit, they didn’t always have strong policies in place to ensure programs that were safe and effective - for both the people and the animals,” Dr. Deborah E. Linder from Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine, Tufts University, North Grafton, Massachusetts told Reuters Health.  “Many facilities assume that a friendly animal or any therapy animal organization will have liability insurance, strong training and testing programs, and rigorous health and grooming requirements. But this study shows that this is not always so,” she said in an email. Pet Partners, a Bellevue, Washington-based organization that registers therapy animals, is the only national therapy animal organization that requires volunteer training and recurring evaluation of animal-handler teams every two years, as well as prohibiting a raw meat diet (which can increase the risk of carrying bacteria that can harm patients with weakened immune systems), according to Linder’s team. Other therapy animal organizations have less comprehensive standards. The Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA) wrote guidelines for animals in healthcare facilities that include such important steps as establishing written policies, identifying people to act as liaisons for therapy animal visits, and having training programs for both animals and handlers, but these guidelines are only voluntary. Dr. Linder’s team surveyed 45 hospitals, 45 eldercare facilities, and 27 regional and local therapy animal organizations regarding their therapy animal policies. Eight hospitals and one eldercare facility said they don’t allow therapy animals. All the facilities that do allow therapy animals fell short on at least one of the SHEA guidelines, according to a report scheduled for publication in the American Journal of Infection Control.  Therapy animal policies varied widely. Two hospitals and 10 eldercare facilities had no policy whatsoever. In general, eldercare facilities had fewer animal health and behavior requirements than hospitals, with some requiring only a minimal written health report for the animals. Most hospitals, though, required at least a meeting or registration from a therapy animal organization before participating. As for the therapy animal organizations, one-third required only an American Kennel Club Canine Good Citizen certificate and only 52% required regular retesting of animals.  The organizations’ health guidelines varied widely, too. Most required a veterinary examination, but two of the 27 organizations did not even require a rabies vaccination and 26% did not require a fecal test. Nearly 70% of therapy animal organizations had no policy against feeding raw meat diets to therapy animals, and only 19% had policies specifically forbidding it.  “The relatively new pet food trend of feeding raw meat . . . is without any documented health benefits and can have serious health risks to animals and to people,” Dr. Linder said. “This includes the risk of bacterial infection, since up to 48% of raw meat-based diets can be contaminated with bacteria such as Salmonella.” “Most facilities don’t think to ask about the diet of animals visiting their facilities,” she said.  Liability insurance was available from 19 of the therapy animal organizations. Two organizations said handlers needed to obtain their own liability insurance. “You cannot assume that any program is safe without asking about the health and safety policies, insurance coverage, and rigorous training and evaluation of therapy animals,” Dr. Linder said. “We recommend people be aware and follow the expert guidelines that are out there.” “We register our therapy animal teams through the national organization Pet Partners because they currently have the most rigorous guidelines and policies for therapy animals (www.petpartners.org),” she said.  Dr. Linder added, “Lax health and safety policies typically aren’t intentional but occur as a result of enthusiasm for therapy animal programs without being aware of potential risks and what questions to ask.”  For institutions that want to do more, she said, her team has created a free manual “that walks facilities through developing a program including what questions to ask,” available at bit.ly/2t4601l. Dr. Indu Mani from Brookline Animal Hospital in Massachusetts studies how pet therapy can enhance patient care. She told Reuters Health by email that therapy animals have had good clinical and psychosocial effects in varied settings. But, she added, the potential for allergies, fear of animals/animal temperament, and the risk for infectious diseases need consideration. She too recommends following the SHEA guidelines.  Lack of adherence to accepted professional guidelines could put both pets and human beings at risk, Mani concluded.  She added, “The lack of regulatory oversight and lack of enforcement of the SHEA guidelines is startling.”  SOURCE: bit.ly/2hMzBXC American Journal of Infection Control, released June 19, 2017.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-hospitals-therapy-animals-idUSKBN19E2B8"},

A separate gun attack on police in the southern megacity of Karachi killed four officers on Friday evening, a security official said. Seven police officers were among those killed in the first attack, in Quetta, which happened when police stopped the car to search it at a checkpoint. Abdul Razzaq Cheema, director general of police in Baluchistan province, of which Quetta is capital, told Reuters the bomber had detonated a car packed with explosives.  At least 13 bodies were taken to hospital, along with 19 wounded people, said Wasim Baig, a spokesman for the Civil Hospital in Quetta. Nine security officials were among the wounded, said Fareed Sumalan, a doctor at the hospital. Jamaat ur Ahrar, a splinter group of the Pakistani Taliban, claimed responsibility for the attack in a message sent to Reuters by its spokesman, Asad Mansur.   Our attacks will continue until a true sharia system is enforced in Pakistan,  the spokesman said, referring to Islamic law. Islamic State (IS) also claimed responsibility for the attack in a message sent to journalists. Jamaat ur Ahrar and IS have jointly claimed responsibility for past attacks in Pakistan.  In the evening, several hundred kilometers to the northeast, two explosions in the town of Parachinar killed at least 27 people and wounded 120, a government official told Reuters. The blasts were in a market and within three minutes of each other, senior government official Wazir Khan Wazir said. Parachinar is near the border with Afghanistan. Many people were at the market buying food for iftar, the evening meal with which Muslims break the daily fast during the holy month of Ramadan. Ramadan ends this weekend. No group claimed responsibility for the Parachinar blasts. Police the Target? In Baluchistan, provincial government spokesman Anwar ul Haq Kakar said the Quetta car bomb went off near the office of the inspector general (IG) of police.  It's possible the IG office was the target, or the assailants were trying to enter the cantonment which is close by,  he said, referring to an army housing area. An official from Baluchistan's bomb disposal unit said the car had contained up to 95 kg of explosives.  Television footage showed emergency workers rushing to the debris-strewn scene as security officials cordoned it off. Quetta is about 100 km (60 miles) east of the border with Afghanistan.  Resource-rich Baluchistan province has been plagued by violence for years. Separatist rebels are battling government forces while Taliban and other militant Islamist groups also operate there. Baluchistan is also a main center of Chinese-backed  Belt and Road  infrastructure and energy projects involving some $57 billion worth of investment across Pakistan. Militants loyal to the Islamic State group abducted and killed two Chinese nationals in Quetta last month. That attack prompted Pakistan to boost security for Chinese nationals and other foreigners in the province, which is already one of the most militarized regions in the country. Late on Friday, in Karachi, Pakistan's largest city and financial capital, four police were shot dead as they were observing the iftar meal to break the daily Ramadan fast, local TV and a security official said.

Abiteboul publicly acknowledged this month that the British driver was under pressure to deliver for Renault after a fallow period in which he has yet to score a single point in the Formula One season.  By contrast, team mate Nico Hulkenberg has registered 18 points and sits 11th in the overall standings. Palmer's hopes of building his confidence ahead of Sunday's street-circuit race in Baku were dented in Friday's evening session when he became another victim of the unpredictable track, hitting the wall during a narrow section at Turn Eight.  It's a bit unfair to link today and the future,  Abiteboul told reporters.  Today we saw a lot of drivers going a bit outside of the track - a lot.  Jo has been one of those at a turn that unfortunately doesn't forgive,  he added.  Unlike other turns.  Palmer was one of several drivers to finish prematurely on Friday, with Sergio Perez of Force India crashing during the afternoon session, and Red Bull's Max Verstappen, who ended both practices with the fastest time, colliding with the barriers late in his evening drive.  If you want to link that to the bigger picture for Jo, our situation is very clear: he has a contract with us; we are completely committed to helping him get through the period, which is a tough period, that's obvious,  Abiteboul added.  He has no ultimatum, but having said that he has to deliver, like every single member of the team.   I think what will help him is that frankly we take him out of the spotlight under which he is constantly, all the media attention is not necessarily helping,  the 39-year-old added.   We are trying our best to protect him but at the same time to do the best as a team to explain to him what we are expecting and we had that type of conversation with him yesterday - go through the metrics and try to define the targets short to medium terms so that he can improve.

Republicans in the U.S. Senate on Thursday unveiled a draft bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare. The bill would replace its individual insurance coverage with new subsidies and requirements and cut federal funding for Medicaid. Hospital groups came out against the bill on Thursday. The legislation includes changes health insurers had been seeking, including tens of billions of dollars to help stabilize the individual insurance market during a transition year and the ability to charge older members more. But it repeals the individual mandate requiring people to buy health insurance without creating incentives for Americans to stay in their plans. In addition, the proposed changes to Medicaid financing for people who were newly covered under Obamacare and those in the standard Medicaid program are dramatic. That program is jointly funded by the states and the federal government.  We're worried about the burden it creates for the states,  Kristine Grow, spokeswoman at America's Health Insurance Plans (AHIP), said on Friday. The lobbying group is waiting to see the analysis of the bill's impact on spending and insurance coverage from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, expected next week. AHIP represents Anthem Inc, one of the largest sellers of health insurance on the Obamacare exchanges, and Cigna Corp, among others. Anthem has decided to leave the individual market in three of the 14 states where it sells Blue Cross Blue Shield plans, while Cigna is still weighing its decision. Molina Healthcare Inc, which has more than 1 million customers in Obamacare plans, said in a statement that dropping the individual mandate with no replacement provision will lead healthy people to forgo coverage and thus drive up premium rates.  The U.S. House of Representatives' version of the Obamcare repeal bill includes a provision in which customers must maintain coverage or pay more, but Democrats argued that conflicted with Republican President Donald Trump's promise to keep the guaranteed insurance provision of Obamacare. Molina also said that the bill's proposal to tie cost-sharing subsidies to the lowest-level  bronze -rated healthcare plans will make coverage less affordable, not more, by raising customers' out-of-pocket costs. Under Obamacare, these subsidies are tied to the mid-range  silver -rated plans.

While senior bank officials shifted tone last week to make it clear rate hikes are in store, the annual inflation rate declined to 1.3 percent in May and price pressures remain well below the bank's 2 percent inflation target. Still, economists expect the bank will follow the Federal Reserve's example and raise rates before inflation proves tighter policy is needed - even if such a move appears to go against their inflation-targeting mandate.  I think it's a conundrum for them,  said Mark Chandler, head of Canadian fixed income and currency strategy at Royal Bank of Canada.  With the U.S. Federal Reserve and Bank of England among central banks tightening or biased toward a hike, Chandler believes global policymakers are responding to shared concerns that low rates may have caused financial instability. The prospect of a strong Business Outlook Survey, to be released June 30 by the bank, may also have spurred the more hawkish tone, said Chandler who expected it to echo exporter optimism reported this week in Export Development Canada survey. While markets have priced in a hike before the end of the year, Friday's low inflation reading reduced the likelihood of a July hike to 22 percent from 35 percent before the report was released. The bank has held rates at 0.50 percent since 2015.  CIBC Capital Markets economist Nick Exarhos expects a rate hike in October and again early in 2018. While core inflation numbers and three of the bank's preferred inflation measures are all subdued, Exarhos said service sector inflation is running closer to 2 percent or 2.5 percent, suggesting made-in-Canada price strength.  Service sector inflation tends to lead the turn and it's been pushing up,  he said.  Services are produced inside Canadian borders, so price pressures are driving inside our borders ... and that's seen as a signal of less slack in the economy.  Exarhos said Canada, like the Fed, wants to start hiking early enough that the increases can be gradual once the economy reaches full capacity - an approach Senior Deputy Governor Carolyn Wilkins likened in a speech last week to a driver  letting up on the gas  before braking for a stop light. Still, not everybody sees a 2017 rate hike. Having signaled tightening is in store, policymakers have reduced the incentive for excessive risk-taking and can wait to ensure inflation is in the pipeline before they actually make a move.  We believe they will wait, but with a hawkish stance,  said Carlos Capistran, head of Canada-Mexico economics for Bank of America Merrill Lynch.  They are really in a place where they could go both ways without hurting credibility.  Reporting by Andrea Hopkins","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-canada-economy-cenbank-idUSKBN19E2AM"},

The news sent Portola's shares up as much as 51 percent to $57.90. The drug, BevyxXa, known also as betrixaban, is the first oral treatment and first extended duration treatment for this patient population, the company said. Roughly 200,000 people in the United States develop deep vein thrombosis each year, with about 40,000 of them dying of pulmonary embolism, caused when a blood clot breaks loose and travels to the lungs, blocking blood flow, the company said.  Analysts on average expect the drug to generate sales of $313 million by 2020, rising to more than $1 billion by 2023, according to Thomson Reuters data. The shares were halted at $38.44 pending the news. They rose to $57.90, more than a 1-1/2-year high, following the news before slipping to $54.08 in late afternoon trading. BevyxXa will compete in the hospital setting with the injectable medications heparin and Sanofi TA's Lovenox, which are typically used for short durations. Unlike those drugs, BevyxXa, a once-daily pill, is designed for use both in hospital and for after a patient goes home. The drug does not currently face competition in the home setting, where the majority of DVT events occur, the company said. BevyxXa was tested using a novel clinical trial strategy designed to test a series of subgroups before testing the broader patient population. It first tested the highest risk patients. Then it tested a lower risk group, and finally the overall patient population. Preliminary data from the trial failed to show that BevyxXa was statistically superior to Lovenox in the highest risk cohort, a finding that threatened to sink the entire trial and sent the company's shares plummeting roughly 30 percent in March 2016. A subsequent analysis that included more patients and was published earlier this year showed that the drug had, in fact, met its main goal in the highest risk population. The FDA's analysis found the same thing. BevyxXa reduced the overall rate of death and blood clots by 1.6 percent compared with Lovenox.

Analysts on average expect the drug to generate sales of $313 million by 2020, rising to more than $1 billion by 2023, according to Thomson Reuters data. The shares were halted at $38.44 pending the news. They rose to $57.90, more than a 1-1/2-year high, following the news before slipping to $54.08 in late afternoon trading. BevyxXa will compete in the hospital setting with the injectable medications heparin and Sanofi TA's Lovenox, which are typically used for short durations. Unlike those drugs, BevyxXa, a once-daily pill, is designed for use both in hospital and for after a patient goes home. The drug does not currently face competition in the home setting, where the majority of DVT events occur, the company said. BevyxXa was tested using a novel clinical trial strategy designed to test a series of subgroups before testing the broader patient population. It first tested the highest risk patients. Then it tested a lower risk group, and finally the overall patient population. Preliminary data from the trial failed to show that BevyxXa was statistically superior to Lovenox in the highest risk cohort, a finding that threatened to sink the entire trial and sent the company's shares plummeting roughly 30 percent in March 2016. A subsequent analysis that included more patients and was published earlier this year showed that the drug had, in fact, met its main goal in the highest risk population. The FDA's analysis found the same thing. BevyxXa reduced the overall rate of death and blood clots by 1.6 percent compared with Lovenox.

The left-hander from Luxembourg is enjoying the best form of his 16-year career and is arguably the form player on grass having put together a seven-match winning run. The 34-year-old carved down 12 aces on Friday as he beat former champion Sam Querrey at the Aegon Championships at London's Queen's Club. But he is no one-trick pony. Muller, something of a late bloomer has terrific touch, a tidy baseline game and, most impressively, still revels in the dying art of serve and volley tennis. Ranked a career-high 26, and rising, Muller could clearly do some damage at Wimbledon where, surprisingly, has never got past the third round in nine attempts. This is a year of firsts for the Luxembourger, though, having won his maiden ATP title at Sydney in January and claiming a second last week on the lawns of Den Bosch. The father of two said his new-found status had taken a while to get used to.  You can understand that it was something that I was working for my whole career, I mean I had to wait 16 years,  he told reporters on Friday after dispatching Querrey 6-4 7-6(5). Tennis - Aegon Championships - Queen’s Club, London, Britain - June 23, 2017   Luxembourg's Gilles Muller celebrates winning his quarter final match against USA's Sam Querrey    Action Images via Reuters/Tony O'Brien You can imagine the weight that I had on my shoulders to get that first trophy. When I got it, it was tough, to be honest. The first weeks after that were kind of a lot of questioning in my mind. So what do we do now?  It's something you work for for so long, and then basically you reach that goal, so what are we doing now?  With those initial questions, Muller has gone from strength to strength, reaching the Estoril final on clay to prove that he really is a man for all surfaces. It is on grass, though, that his chances of a career-defining moment look most likely, especially as he will be going into Wimbledon as a seed and with his confidence overflowing.  I think it's a lot about momentum,  Muller, who beat Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in the second round, said.  I think on grass everything goes so fast, and I feel like even when you don't play well you can still stay in the match with your serve.  I feel that on grass I'm always taking the good choice on important moments like I did on break points today.  Muller, his country's only player in the top 1,600 in the ATP rankings, is clearly reveling in the golden days of his career - another example of the 30-something brigade proving that tennis careers can now flourish for longer.  I was never top 30 before in my life, and now this year for the first time I have a  2  in front of my ranking,  he said.  I always dreamed of playing in front of (my two boys), It feels like I don't want to stop.  Editing by Ed Osmond","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-tennis-london-muller-idUSKBN19E2AE"},

Republicans in the U.S. Senate on Thursday unveiled a draft bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare. The bill would replace its individual insurance coverage with new subsidies and requirements and cut federal funding for Medicaid. Hospital groups came out against the bill on Thursday. The legislation includes changes health insurers had been seeking, including tens of billions of dollars to help stabilize the individual insurance market during a transition year and the ability to charge older members more. But it repeals the individual mandate requiring people to buy health insurance without creating incentives for Americans to stay in their plans. In addition, the proposed changes to Medicaid financing for people who were newly covered under Obamacare and those in the standard Medicaid program are dramatic. That program is jointly funded by the states and the federal government.  We're worried about the burden it creates for the states,  Kristine Grow, spokeswoman at America's Health Insurance Plans (AHIP), said on Friday. The lobbying group is waiting to see the analysis of the bill's impact on spending and insurance coverage from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, expected next week. AHIP represents Anthem Inc, one of the largest sellers of health insurance on the Obamacare exchanges, and Cigna Corp, among others. Anthem has decided to leave the individual market in three of the 14 states where it sells Blue Cross Blue Shield plans, while Cigna is still weighing its decision. Molina Healthcare Inc, which has more than 1 million customers in Obamacare plans, said in a statement that dropping the individual mandate with no replacement provision will lead healthy people to forgo coverage and thus drive up premium rates.  The U.S. House of Representatives' version of the Obamcare repeal bill includes a provision in which customers must maintain coverage or pay more, but Democrats argued that conflicted with Republican President Donald Trump's promise to keep the guaranteed insurance provision of Obamacare. Molina also said that the bill's proposal to tie cost-sharing subsidies to the lowest-level  bronze -rated healthcare plans will make coverage less affordable, not more, by raising customers' out-of-pocket costs. Under Obamacare, these subsidies are tied to the mid-range  silver -rated plans.

Among 3,749 black adults participating in a long-term study of heart disease risk factors, experiences with discrimination were a strong determinant of poor sleep, and in particular, short sleep duration and poor sleep quality, the lead researcher told Reuters Health.   It is important to identify those most at risk, and in our study, women were particularly vulnerable to the effects of discrimination on sleep. Women with the most experiences with discrimination slept on average 30 minutes less at night than those with fewer experiences with discrimination,  Dr. Dayna A. Johnson of Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston added in an email. Johnson and her colleagues reported their findings at a joint meeting of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine and the Sleep Research Society in Boston. Between 2000 and 2004 and again between 2008 and 2012, study participants completed the Modified Williams Everyday Discrimination Scale, a questionnaire that asks about the frequency of experiences with everyday mistreatment. For example: How often on a day-to-day basis do you have the following experiences: being treated with less courtesy; being treated with less respect; do people act as if you are dishonest? Participants also reported their sleep duration and rated their sleep quality from 1 (poor) to 5 (excellent).  At the start, the participants were 55 years old on average, about two-thirds were women, and about 55 percent reported that they slept no more than six hours a night.  From the beginning, discrimination and sleep quality were linked. The association remained constant over time, the research team found.  Compared to participants who reported low levels of discrimination, participants who reported higher levels had 43 percent higher odds of short sleep; they slept 15 minutes less on average per night; and they had lower sleep quality scores. Women who reported higher levels of discrimination slept 22 minutes less on average compared to those who reported lower levels of discrimination.  Research has shown that discrimination is strongly related to adverse health outcomes among African Americans,  Johnson said.  Based on our findings, it is likely that the influence of stress on sleep is partially attributable to experiences with discrimination. African Americans are continually exposed to experiences of discrimination firsthand, through the vicarious experiences of friends and family, or through the media.    As a result of the differences in the coping strategies, women may be more affected by experiences of discrimination although they report lower levels and thus have sleep difficulties,  she added.  Dr. Michael Grandner, Director of the Sleep and Health Research Program at the University of Arizona College of Medicine in Tucson, told Reuters Health that in earlier research, exposure to racial discrimination was associated with worse sleep, even after taking stress and depression into account.   Racial and ethnic minorities in the U.S. routinely have worse sleep, and this is important for their overall health and well-being,  noted Grandner, who was not involved in the study.   Knowing that these social-environmental factors play a role in sleep health may persuade clinicians not only to take sleep more seriously, but also to focus more on how they may need to be creative in order to improve health in a social environment that may not be supportive,  he said by email. Johnson said that the study's strengths include the large number of African Americans who participated. She also acknowledges limitations, including that study was confined to residents of Jackson, Mississippi, which limits the generalizability of the results. Also, she points out, people often overestimate how long they’ve slept, so the amounts in the study might not be completely reliable.  Johnson said her team plans to study the issue further using more-reliable sleep data.

While senior bank officials shifted tone last week to make it clear rate hikes are in store, the annual inflation rate declined to 1.3 percent in May and price pressures remain well below the bank's 2 percent inflation target. Still, economists expect the bank will follow the Federal Reserve's example and raise rates before inflation proves tighter policy is needed - even if such a move appears to go against their inflation-targeting mandate.  I think it's a conundrum for them,  said Mark Chandler, head of Canadian fixed income and currency strategy at Royal Bank of Canada.  With the U.S. Federal Reserve and Bank of England among central banks tightening or biased toward a hike, Chandler believes global policymakers are responding to shared concerns that low rates may have caused financial instability. The prospect of a strong Business Outlook Survey, to be released June 30 by the bank, may also have spurred the more hawkish tone, said Chandler who expected it to echo exporter optimism reported this week in Export Development Canada survey. While markets have priced in a hike before the end of the year, Friday's low inflation reading reduced the likelihood of a July hike to 22 percent from 35 percent before the report was released. The bank has held rates at 0.50 percent since 2015.  CIBC Capital Markets economist Nick Exarhos expects a rate hike in October and again early in 2018. While core inflation numbers and three of the bank's preferred inflation measures are all subdued, Exarhos said service sector inflation is running closer to 2 percent or 2.5 percent, suggesting made-in-Canada price strength.  Service sector inflation tends to lead the turn and it's been pushing up,  he said.  Services are produced inside Canadian borders, so price pressures are driving inside our borders ... and that's seen as a signal of less slack in the economy.  Exarhos said Canada, like the Fed, wants to start hiking early enough that the increases can be gradual once the economy reaches full capacity - an approach Senior Deputy Governor Carolyn Wilkins likened in a speech last week to a driver  letting up on the gas  before braking for a stop light. Still, not everybody sees a 2017 rate hike. Having signaled tightening is in store, policymakers have reduced the incentive for excessive risk-taking and can wait to ensure inflation is in the pipeline before they actually make a move.  We believe they will wait, but with a hawkish stance,  said Carlos Capistran, head of Canada-Mexico economics for Bank of America Merrill Lynch.  They are really in a place where they could go both ways without hurting credibility.  Reporting by Andrea Hopkins","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/canada-economy-cenbank-idUSL1N1JK0WU"},

The Pirates of the Caribbean  star spoke during an appearance at Britain's Glastonbury music festival on Thursday when he pondered how long it had been since an actor had killed a U.S. president. His remarks drew rebukes from Trump supporters, and the White House described Depp's remarks as  sad.   President Trump has condemned violence in all forms and it's sad that others like Johnny Depp have not followed his lead,  the White House said in a statement.  I hope that some of Mr. Depp’s colleagues will speak out against this type of rhetoric as strongly as they would if his comments were directed to a Democratic elected official.   Depp on Friday said his remarks were not intended maliciously. “I apologize for the bad joke I attempted last night in poor taste about President Trump,” Depp, 54, said in a statement. “It did not come out as intended, and I intended no malice. I was only trying to amuse, not to harm anyone.” Depp was at a screening of his 2004 film  The Libertine  at the Glastonbury festival when discussion turned to the topic of Trump. Depp said he thought the president  needs help.    Can we bring Trump here?  Depp asked the audience.  ... When was the last time an actor assassinated a president?

Now I want to clarify, I'm not an actor,  Depp continued.  I lie for a living. However, it's been a while, and maybe it's time.  The U.S. Secret Service said it was aware of Depp's comments but had no other comment. Some Republicans criticized Depp's comments as part of a grim trend.   I'm sick of celebrities getting away with such disgusting comments,  Ronna Romney McDaniel, the Republican National Committees chairwoman, wrote on Twitter. Depp, whose latest  Pirates of the Caribbean  movie was panned by critics in May, has had more than a year of bad press following an acrimonious divorce from actress Amber Heard and a lawsuit against his former business managers that has detailed claims of lavish spending by the actor. Earlier in June, Delta Air Lines and Bank of America pulled their sponsorship of a New York production of Shakespeare's  Julius Caesar  because the assassinated Roman ruler was portrayed as a Trump-like businessman. Last month comedian Kathy Griffin posed in photographs holding up a fake bloody, severed head resembling Trump. She also apologized but was fired from hosting CNN's annual New Year's Eve broadcast. Last week, a gunman opened fire on Republican lawmakers in  who were practicing for a charity baseball game.

Chile's President Michelle Bachelet delivers a message asking for forgiveness from Chile's indigenous Mapuche people for  errors and horrors  committed by the state and announcing plans to give them more power and resources, at the government house in Santiago, Chile June 23, 2017. Alex Ibanez/Courtesy of Chilean Presidency/Handout via ReutersEver since the Chilean army invaded the territory of the Mapuche in a brutal campaign in the late 1800s, Mapuche relations with the state and settlers of European descent have been fractious. The Mapuche accuse the state and private companies of taking their ancestral land, draining its natural resources, and using undue violence against them. Their communities are among the poorest in Chile. In recent years, acts of arson against forestry companies and other industries, often attributed to disgruntled Mapuche, have accelerated in the region. While Bachelet's announcement will likely draw support from some Mapuche and elements of her base, it may not be welcomed by industry groups and tough-on-crime conservatives in Chile's divided south. Several congressmen from Araucania and Bio Bio did not attend Bachelet's ceremony in protest. The new measures closely follow an announcement by the Vatican that Pope Francis will visit Chile in 2018, a trip that will include a visit to the heavily Mapuche city of Temuco.  We will have, I hope, good news to give him,  Bachelet said.

The donation by Prince Mohammed bin Salman went to the United Nations Children's Fund and the World Health Organization (WHO), as requested by the organizations, a statement by the Saudi ministry of culture and information said. It would help them  respond effectively to the cholera situation in Yemen, through a combination of water, sanitation and healthcare activities , it said. The number of suspected cases of the disease, which is caused by the contamination of water or food by faeces, reached 179,548 by June 20, with 1,205 deaths, according to the WHO. U.N. humanitarian chief Stephen O'Brien has described the cholera outbreak as a  man-made catastrophe  caused by the warring sides in Yemen's civil war and their international backers. The country has suffered an economic collapse in two years of fighting which has left 19 million people in need of humanitarian aid. The conflict has killed more than 10,000 people, displaced more than 3 million and ruined much of its infrastructure. As defense minister, Prince Mohammed is regarded by diplomats and analysts as a prime mover behind the Saudi decision to take military action in Yemen.1 The exiled Yemeni government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, backed by the Saudi-led coalition, is trying to roll back gains made by the Iran-aligned Houthi group which controls most of northern Yemen, including the capital Sanaa.

The Pirates of the Caribbean  star spoke during an appearance at Britain's Glastonbury music festival on Thursday when he pondered how long it had been since an actor had killed a U.S. president. His remarks drew rebukes from Trump supporters, and the White House described Depp's remarks as  sad.   President Trump has condemned violence in all forms and it's sad that others like Johnny Depp have not followed his lead,  the White House said in a statement.  I hope that some of Mr. Depp’s colleagues will speak out against this type of rhetoric as strongly as they would if his comments were directed to a Democratic elected official.   Depp on Friday said his remarks were not intended maliciously. “I apologize for the bad joke I attempted last night in poor taste about President Trump,” Depp, 54, said in a statement. “It did not come out as intended, and I intended no malice. I was only trying to amuse, not to harm anyone.” Depp was at a screening of his 2004 film  The Libertine  at the Glastonbury festival when discussion turned to the topic of Trump. Depp said he thought the president  needs help.    Can we bring Trump here?  Depp asked the audience.  ... When was the last time an actor assassinated a president?  FILE PHOTO: Actor Johnny Depp poses on a Cadillac before presenting his film The Libertine, at Cinemageddon at Worthy Farm in Somerset during the Glastonbury Festival in Britain, June 22, 2017.Dylan Martinez/File PhotoActor John Wilkes Booth assassinated U.S. President Abraham Lincoln in 1865.   Now I want to clarify, I'm not an actor,  Depp continued.  I lie for a living. However, it's been a while, and maybe it's time.  The U.S. Secret Service said it was aware of Depp's comments but had no other comment. Some Republicans criticized Depp's comments as part of a grim trend.   I'm sick of celebrities getting away with such disgusting comments,  Ronna Romney McDaniel, the Republican National Committees chairwoman, wrote on Twitter. Depp, whose latest  Pirates of the Caribbean  movie was panned by critics in May, has had more than a year of bad press following an acrimonious divorce from actress Amber Heard and a lawsuit against his former business managers that has detailed claims of lavish spending by the actor. Earlier in June, Delta Air Lines and Bank of America pulled their sponsorship of a New York production of Shakespeare's  Julius Caesar  because the assassinated Roman ruler was portrayed as a Trump-like businessman. Last month comedian Kathy Griffin posed in photographs holding up a fake bloody, severed head resembling Trump. She also apologized but was fired from hosting CNN's annual New Year's Eve broadcast. Last week, a gunman opened fire on Republican lawmakers in  who were practicing for a charity baseball game.

Representative John Yarmuth, top Democrat on the House of Representatives Budget Committee, predicted Trump's promise to deliver the biggest tax reform since Ronald Reagan would have to be scaled back if the Republican-controlled Senate fails next week to adopt legislation dismantling Obamacare, formally known as the Affordable Care Act. The Trump administration and Republican congressional leaders are trying to agree in closed-door talks on a comprehensive 2017 tax reform bill that would cut taxes for individuals and businesses and overhaul the U.S. tax code. Their aim is to unveil legislation in September.  But a Republican effort to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, which would could ease the path to tax reform, faces difficulties in the Senate, where a healthcare measure is opposed by enough lawmakers to block passage. Yarmuth, a Kentucky Democrat, said there are also few signs that House and Senate Republicans can unify their fractured caucuses to pass a fiscal 2018 budget resolution, which they must do to enact tax reform without Democratic votes.  Tax reform is going to be really difficult,  Yarmuth said.  If they limited it to corporate tax reform, I think there's an opportunity to get it home and get it done on a bipartisan basis.  Trump wants to cut business tax rates to 15 percent. Yarmuth said  a fair amount of Democrats  agree that the current 35 percent corporate tax rate is too high and should be more competitive with other countries. A bipartisan package could lower the corporate tax rate to 25 percent or 28 percent and include measures to help small businesses, Yarmuth said.    Republicans have thus far balked at the idea of a narrow corporate tax deal. On Thursday, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady said Republicans would reject tax legislation that left the corporate rate at around 28 percent.   But tax rate targets have eluded Republican efforts to hammer out a deal. Some lawmakers say a defeat for the Senate healthcare bill would make tax reform harder by leaving in place hundreds of billions of dollars in Obamacare taxes Meanwhile, the House Budget Committee hopes to send a budget proposal to the floor next week that would include a procedural path for tax reform to proceed with only Republican votes, panel members said. They warned that any Republican deal within the committee did not ensure speedy passage in the Republican-led House, where conservative Republicans want a budget that includes steep cuts to domestic spending, which more moderate Republicans oppose. Yarmuth said Republicans, at one point, considered using language in a 2018 budget proposal - known as reconciliation instructions - for both tax reform and healthcare, a move that could keep hopes for dismantling Obamacare alive if the Senate fails to pass a bill.

The countries' ultimatum to Doha includes closing Al Jazeera television, curbing ties with Iran, shutting a Turkish base and paying reparations, demands so far-reaching it would appear to be hard for Doha to comply. “This is our list of demands from Qatar. They’re (demands) are all important. This is a consistent pattern of behavior that affects all of us,  the UAE ambassador to the United States, Yousef Al Otaiba, told Reuters.  We would hope that Qatar reacts by engaging and not by leaking documents and trying to have this litigated in public.  If Qatar does not engage,  things will stay at the status quo, things will stay as they are,  he said.         Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bahrain and the UAE have cut economic, diplomatic and travel ties with Qatar, which they accuse of funding terrorism, fomenting regional unrest and drawing too close to their enemy, Iran. Qatar rejects those accusations and says it is being punished for straying from its neighbors' backing for authoritarian hereditary and military rulers.         Otaiba also accused Qatar of leaking the 13-point list of demands, an accusation made by UAE Minister of Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash earlier on Friday.     Asked to respond to accusations by UAE officials that Qatar had leaked the document, the Qatar embassy in Washington did not comment. The UAE has said sanctions could last for years. Qatar, the world's richest country per capita, says the sanctions amount to a  blockade,  but it has ample reserves to weather the storm. Washington, which is a close military ally of countries on both sides of the dispute, had called for a resolution.

As part of the lifting of capital controls imposed during the 2008 financial crisis to stop money flooding out of Iceland, the bank wants to buy back the remaining assets - known as  offshore crown  - that were locked in Iceland during its eight years of controls. It had extended the latest round of auctions to give more investors, which were mostly U.S. funds, time to sign up.  Since March 12, when most of the remaining capital controls were lifted, the central bank has bought a total of 112.4 billion crowns of offshore crown assets in two stages at an exchange rate of 137.5 crowns per euro, it said in a statement.  The Central Bank estimates the stock of offshore crown assets at about 88 billion crowns following the trades.  While foreign holders can sell the bonds, the proceeds have to stay in a special ultra-low-interest Icelandic bank account. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Thursday recommended Iceland roll back the reserve requirement on selected debt holdings to zero. With lower interest rates in Iceland and global interest rates trending higher, the IMF said there was little reason to keep measures in place to manage capital flows. U.S. fund Loomis Sayles has said it will not exchange its Icelandic bonds until it is offered the current exchange rate for the assets. The rate is significantly stronger, at 115.65 crowns per euro EURISK=. A tourism boom has helped economic growth in Iceland in recent years but has also pushed the currency up to levels where it hurts exports.

As part of the lifting of capital controls imposed during the 2008 financial crisis to stop money flooding out of Iceland, the bank wants to buy back the remaining assets - known as  offshore crown  - that were locked in Iceland during its eight years of controls. It had extended the latest round of auctions to give more investors, which were mostly U.S. funds, time to sign up.  Since March 12, when most of the remaining capital controls were lifted, the central bank has bought a total of 112.4 billion crowns of offshore crown assets in two stages at an exchange rate of 137.5 crowns per euro, it said in a statement.  The Central Bank estimates the stock of offshore crown assets at about 88 billion crowns following the trades.  While foreign holders can sell the bonds, the proceeds have to stay in a special ultra-low-interest Icelandic bank account. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Thursday recommended Iceland roll back the reserve requirement on selected debt holdings to zero. With lower interest rates in Iceland and global interest rates trending higher, the IMF said there was little reason to keep measures in place to manage capital flows. U.S. fund Loomis Sayles has said it will not exchange its Icelandic bonds until it is offered the current exchange rate for the assets. The rate is significantly stronger, at 115.65 crowns per euro EURISK=. A tourism boom has helped economic growth in Iceland in recent years but has also pushed the currency up to levels where it hurts exports. In response to the crown strengthening, the central bank this month cut its benchmark interest rate for the fourth time in less than a year to 4.5 percent.

And for Iain Murray, the man running the event, the key to making the 35th America's Cup a success has been to have the rules spelt out in  black and white  before crews even took to the crystal-clear waters of Bermuda. That means reams of protocols and instructions that can be understood and adhered to by competitors, reducing the need for  subjective  decisions. The umpires are also using a state-of-the art combination of GPS, electronics and graphics to ensure decisions are accurate.  Essentially, it's the same technology that sends a missile into someone's lounge room,  Murray told Reuters on Friday at Bermuda's Dockyard, where the America's Cup finalists Emirates Team New Zealand and holders Oracle Team USA will resume battle for international sport's oldest trophy this weekend. The regatta director has had some tough calls to make.  The hard one here has been the upper wind limit ... the day it came into question was the day that New Zealand capsized. For some people, it was my fault, but the rules had been modified a week before to actually lower the wind limits and to make it very clear,  he said. The New Zealand crew  pitch poled  - making a spectacular high-speed forward capsize - just before they were about to start a semi-final against Britain's Land Rover BAR (Ben Ainslie Racing) boat. Some of the six crew were plunged into the water and others left clinging to the upended hull of their 50-foot (15-metre) foiling catamaran. The capsize brought back memories from San Francisco in 2013, when Andrew  Bart  Simpson was killed in a similar incident.  It's the same issue we went through in San Francisco after the fatality of Bart,  said Murray, who was a friend of the British Olympic gold medal sailor. Murray was the official who had to come up with a safety plan immediately after Simpson's death that would convince the coastguard to allow the competition to continue. The boats have evolved since 2013. They are smaller and  much more robust , and safety has been a major preoccupation for all the teams and the America's Cup organizers.  These are top-end boats, and in the wrong hands, they can be dangerous. They go fast, and when they go wrong, situations can get bad,  Murray said.  These guys are the best sailors in the world and they have worked for years to sail these boats and develop the systems on their boats. They don't want to crash their boats, they don't want to capsize. You won't win races doing that,  he added.  The difficulty is when they fall off the front or fall underneath ... that's the world of foiling sailing boats.  In recent decades foils - slender underwater  wings  that can lift a speeding vessel out of the water, minimizing its drag - have become ubiquitous in racing sailing.  Ask  Umpapp  Murray's right-hand man Richard Slater, who is chief umpire at the event, has also had some tough calls to make during the racing leading up to the America's Cup final. Slater was on the receiving end of some vocal protests by Artemis Racing's Team Manager Iain Percy during the Swedish team's semi-final races after imposing penalties on them, but said that was to be expected given the intensity of racing.  You're dealing with the heat of the battle and that's one thing, as umpires, you have to remember,  Slater told Reuters, adding that the sailors were in the  red zone  physically and this was bound to result in them reacting strongly to decisions. The umpires are armed with a graphics system called  UmpApp , which allows them to make calls based on information that is accurate to millimeters and milliseconds, and are focused on that to make sure they make the right call quickly.   If anything, when he was yelling at us we weren't even listening at that point,  Slater said, adding that the teams have access to the same information within seconds, so that they can see why a decision has been made.  UmpApp is kind of like a game,  Murray said, saying it was easy for the younger sailors to get their heads around.

The 18-times grand slam champion, whose last title at Halle was in 2015, skipped the entire claycourt season after winning the Australian Open and claiming titles at Indian Wells and Miami this year, to prepare for grass.  He will face rapidly rising talent Karen Khachanov, who won his all-Russian quarter-final against Andrey Rublev 7-6(8) 4-6 6-3 to reach his first tour semi-final of the year.  It was important to be aggressive off the baseline and make him feel my variation and the power I can bring to the court,  Federer said.  I think I did it very well. I had lots of chances to even go up a double break in the second set.   I thought I was very calm out there, even in difficult moments. I was calm serving out the first and second sets. Those are always signs for me that things are slowly starting to fall into place nicely.  Federer, who has yet to drop a set in Halle after losing in Stuttgart in his first match back last week, limited his serve-and-volley game against the German who is a fine returner and Mayer was broken quickly as his opponent won the first set. The 33-year-old Mayer squandered two break-points at 1-0 in the second set and paid the price as Federer broke again and never relinquished his advantage to win in just over an hour. Frenchman Richard Gasquet also reached the last four, edging past Dutchman Robin Haase, who had eliminated second seed Dominic Thiem in the previous round, 6-1 3-6 6-1 and looked to be hitting top grasscourt form at just the right time. Gasquet will next play Germany's Alexander Zverev, last year's finalist who has won three titles this season, after he muscled past baseliner Roberto Bautista-Agut 6-7(6) 7-6(1) 6-1. The pair held serve for almost two hours before Zverev managed the first break of the match early in the third set and the 20-year-old broke again two games later to finish the Spaniard off.

Hamilton dominated practice in Baku last year ahead of Azerbaijan's first grand prix, but struggled on Friday and finished the second session in 10th place, 1.163 seconds behind pace-setter Max Verstappen. He also nearly collided with Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen at the first turn. The three-times world champion will be desperate to banish memories of last year's race, when he clipped a barrier in qualifying, started 10th on the grid, and ended up in fifth.  It was a difficult day out there,  Briton Hamilton said.  This circuit is a tough one and we had a few challenges that we tried to work through today.   We've clearly still got lots of work to do ahead of qualifying, but (team mate) Valtteri (Bottas)'s time in FP2 looked promising, so there is obviously pace in the car, which is encouraging.   Now it's just a case of getting our heads together tonight to work out exactly how to extract that pace across the entire weekend.  Finnish driver Bottas predicted on Thursday that some drivers would struggle with the slippy and dusty conditions in Baku's street circuit, and he was proved right as Sergio Perez, Jolyon Palmer and Verstappen crashed into the barriers. It was a  scrappy day punctuated every few seconds by dozens and dozens of off-track frolics , according to Mercedes technical director James Allison. But although Bottas had a close shave after going into a spin on Turn 10 in practice one, he recovered to finish second, a 10th of a second behind Verstappen, in the evening.  Practice one was quite tricky,  Bottas said.  We were struggling with the set-up of the car and it wasn't so well balanced.   Today, we needed multiple laps in a row to generate the temperatures we want for a good balance. FP1 wasn't a happy session, but we made some changes ahead of FP2 and the car definitely felt more comfortable,  he added.  We are moving in the right direction and hopefully we'll make another step this evening. We'll work hard and if we can find those gains we'll be right up there fighting for pole position.

The 2004 Olympic champion, Gatlin was ineligible for the 2008 Beijing Games while serving a four-year doping ban. He watched from a restaurant as Bolt wiped out world records in the 100 and 200 meters.  It was just total respect for how fast he is, the competition he brings,  the 35-year-old Gatlin said. Since then, with Gatlin returning from his ban in 2010, they have raced nine times at 100 meters with a 2013 Diamond League win in Rome Gatlin's only victory. While Bolt was racking up world and Olympic gold medals, Gatlin won bronze at the 2012 London Olympics followed by silver at the 2013 and 2015 world championships and at last year's Rio Games. This season has been a struggle with various injuries, but Gatlin said it would be pleasing to be back at worlds in London.  It would be the toughest year for me,  the 2005 world champion said.  But it would be an honor to get through and show the fortitude that I have.  While London will be the last race for the 30-year-old Bolt, Gatlin, more than four years older, hopes to continue running.  That's the fun part,  he told Reuters.  Now that void that Usain will leave will open the door for others to step up and be competitive. That's going to be exciting.

The engineer's email was disclosed in a statement from Honda as part of its defense in a class action suit in Florida, where plaintiffs are seeking compensation for the lost value of vehicles due to defects in Takata air bag inflators. The inflators can explode with excessive force, launching metal shrapnel at passengers in cars and trucks. The inflators prompted the automotive industry's largest ever safety recall and have been linked to at least 16 deaths worldwide. Nine of the 11 U.S. deaths have been reported in 2001-2003 model Honda and Acura vehicles The engineer's July 18, 2013 email, originally written in Japanese and translated by Honda, is part of an exchange with a colleague at the automaker.  I am a witness in the dark who knows the truth about Takata's inflator recall,  the engineer, whose name is blacked out in Honda's statement, wrote in his email.  If I say something to NHTSA, it will cause a complete reversal in the auto industry which adopted Takata inflators,  added the engineer, who told his colleague he had been taken off air bag-related work by Honda because of his supposed inside knowledge. NHTSA is the acronym of the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. In a sworn affidavit filed with a federal court and dated June 1, 2017, the engineer acknowledged he had been mistaken, however. When he wrote email to his colleague, he was referring to an Oct. 16, 1999 event in which a prototype Takata air bag inflator ruptured, the engineer stated.  I believed that the root cause of the October 16, 1999 rupture related to the root cause of the Takata inflator recalls,  the affidavit stated. Based on later findings by the NHTSA,  I now understand that I was incorrect and the root cause of the field events is not related to the root cause of the October 1999 rupture.

The breakeven price at the Loma Campana field is $43 per barrel and falling while development costs are $12.90 per barrel and expected to fall to $10 next year, said Pablo Bizzotto, executive manager at YPF's unconventional resources unit.  Ten dollars is world-class compared with the Permian  shale field in Texas, he told reporters this week during a tour of windswept Loma Campana, where YPF produces 40,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and co-investor Chevron Corp produces another 20,000.       If we can get there in Vaca Muerta, we're competitive,  he said, referring to Argentina's Belgium-sized shale formation of which Loma Campana was the first productive field. The cost cuts are good news for Argentine President Mauricio Macri, who has sought to attract investment to Vaca Muerta to help close Argentina's costly energy deficit since taking office in late 2015.  While the play is thought to have some of the world's largest shale oil and gas reserves, just two of its 19 concessions have moved from the pilot to production stage amid investor concerns over high labor costs and logistical difficulties in the distant Patagonian province of Neuquen. To address that, the government plans to invest $1.2 billion to renovate the 1,300 km (807.78 miles) of railroad tracks connecting Atlantic ports in Buenos Aires and Bahia Blanca to Anelo, the closest town to the oil fields, located in an isolated, flat desert region where materials needed for production arrive by truck.   It's much needed,  Bizzotto said of the train, adding that logistics account for 50 percent of the cost of sand needed for hydraulic fracturing.  It will lower logistical costs for things that should not be transported via truck, like sand and tubes.   Price Floors and Geosteering In January, Macri struck a deal to woo investments from major oil companies by ensuring attractive prices and getting unions to agree to a series of measures to lower notoriously high labor costs. As part of the deal, the government has guaranteed producers $55 per barrel for Medanito crude from July onward and $7.50 per million British thermal units of natural gas, helping companies like YPF beat their break-even costs.  Both guarantees are above market prices. On Friday, front-month Brent crude was trading at $45.37 per barrel, while natural gas futures were at $2.92 per million British thermal units. YPF's cost cuts would come mainly from drilling longer horizontal wells and drilling technology improvements, Bizzotto said. The company's horizontal wells are about 2,500 meters (8202.1 feet) long, and YPF is planning to pilot a 3,200-meter well in the second half of this year.  He also showed the company's  geosteering  project, currently in its pilot phase, in which engineers sitting in a control room with dozens of screens can remotely modify a drill's path through a well in real time. The process has increased drilling speed by 27 percent on the 10 to 15 wells where it has been used since the pilot began one year ago, Bizzotto said.   In the future, the new leap in productivity and well quality in Vaca Muerta is totally associated with geosteering,  he said.  What we are doing is profitable.  Vaca Muerta contains 308 trillion cubic feet of shale gas and 16.2 billion barrels of shale oil, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

The court decided that government officials can combine separate parcels of private land in determining whether public officials have effectively taken private property through zoning laws and must pay compensation. The ruling could make it harder for property owners to prove compensation claims. The justices, in the 5-3 ruling written by conservative Justice Anthony Kennedy and joined by the court's four liberals, upheld the use of zoning regulations by Wisconsin to prevent members of the Murr family from selling the vacant lot because the four siblings also owned an adjoining parcel of land. The ruling set out a multi-factor test for courts to use to determine when a property taking requiring compensation to an owner has occurred, weighing how land is divided, its physical relationship to the surrounding environment, and the value of the land.   This is an unfortunate decision for the Murrs, and all property owners,  said John Groen, executive vice president and general counsel of the Pacific Legal Foundation, the conservative legal group that represented the family. The state's attorney general, Republican Brad Schimel, called the ruling a  victory for the rule of law in Wisconsin.  State and local governments nationwide are grappling with ways to manage urban sprawl, provide services to residents and protect the environment, often by limiting the use of private property and leading to litigation by landowners.  Courts have recognized that in some cases, regulation can go so far as to deprive the owner of the value of their property, requiring compensation by the government. The legal issue behind the Murr family's case is how courts should make that call.  The dispute began in 2004 when the four Murr siblings, who own two adjacent parcels of land on the St. Croix River in Troy, Wisconsin, wanted to sell an empty lot purchased by their late parents decades ago as a family investment, hoping to fund repairs to their family cabin on the adjacent parcel. Citing zoning regulations, county officials told them it was too small to develop and they would have to sell it with the adjacent lot.  The Murrs sued, alleging that the government had effectively taken the land without compensation. Without the ability to sell or develop the lot, it had been rendered economically useless, they said. A Wisconsin appeals court sided with the state and local county in 2014, saying officials had not deprived the family of their property because both lots were contiguous and could be sold or developed together.  The family appealed to the Supreme Court. Their position was supported by various agricultural, real estate and business groups, which argued that the Wisconsin court decision made it more difficult to prove the government unfairly deprived them of their land.  Supported by the Trump administration, Wisconsin told the justices that for conservation and other reasons under state law, adjacent lots that are separately too small will be merged if they come under common ownership. Given the test laid out in the ruling, Kennedy said, the Murrs' property  should be evaluated as a single parcel.  Objecting to the test, Chief Justice John Roberts filed a dissenting opinion. Justice Neil Gorsuch, who joined the court after the case was argued, did not participate in Friday's decision.

The yield curve flattened this week as oil prices declined and concerns lingered over last week’s weaker-than-expected Consumer Price Index report.     “For the third month in a row, (CPI) was way below expectations,” said Jim Vogel, an interest rate strategist at FTN Financial in Memphis, Tennessee, adding that continued declines in non-seasonally adjusted consumer prices played a large role in the market move.     A decline in oil prices despite positive fundamentals added to concerns, Vogel said.     The yield curve                was last at 96 basis points after flattening to 95 basis points on Thursday, the lowest since December 2007.     Benchmark 10-year notes             were unchanged on the day in price to yield 2.15 percent.     Expectations that the Fed will continue on its tightening course has weighed on short- and intermediate-dated notes, which are the most sensitive to central bank's policy, even as longer-dated debt rallied.     New York Fed President William Dudley and Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren both took a hawkish tone this week on monetary policy, noting that pausing the tightening cycle could pose risks to the economy.     Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester added to the sentiment on Friday, saying that recent inflation weakness was likely temporary and it should not delay another interest-rate hike this year.                  St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, by contrast, said on Friday that the Fed should wait on any further rate increases until it is clear inflation is reliably heading to the Fed's 2 percent target.                  The Fed has emphasized the improving job market and an expectation that inflation will return to targets despite recent declines.     The next major economic release, June’s employment report on July 7, will be watched for signs of further improvement in the labor force.     “If the Fed is going to continue to watch the employment rate while everyone else watches inflation, the Fed’s probably not going to veer off its course,” said Vogel.

Drillers added 11 oil rigs in the week to June 23, bringing the total count up to 758, the most since April 2015, energy services firm Baker Hughes Inc said in its closely followed report on Friday.  That is more than double the same week a year ago when there were only 330 active oil rigs. Drillers have added rigs in 52 of the past 56 weeks since the start of June 2016.  The higher rig count this week reflects decisions made a couple of months ago when oil prices were higher,  said James Williams, president of WTRG Economics in Arkansas, noting he expects the current low prices to cause the count to fall in some weeks over the next month or two. U.S. crude futures were trading around $43 per barrel, which puts the front-month on track for a fifth consecutive week of declines and close to a 10-month low as OPEC-led production cuts have failed to reduce a global crude glut.  After agreeing in December to cut production by around 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) from January-June, OPEC and other producers in late May agreed to extend those cuts for another nine months through the end of March 2018. Analysts said those OPEC-led cuts were being frustrated by rising output from U.S. shale drillers and other producers hoping to capture higher oil prices in future months. Futures for the balance of 2017 were trading just over $43 a barrel, while calendar 2018 was fetching about $45 a barrel. Analysts said crude prices are likely to remain under pressure until there are signs the number of rigs drilling for oil in the United States is stabilizing or declining. U.S. producers are expected to increase output to 9.3 million bpd in 2017 and a record 10.0 million bpd in 2018 from 8.9 million bpd in 2016, according to federal projections.  The biggest increase in rigs this week was in the Bakken formation in North Dakota where drillers added three rigs, bringing the total there to 52, the most since December 2015 and double the same week a year ago.  It's not surprising the rig count has been rising in the Bakken because producers there will not see the full extent of the crude price drop we've had over the past month,  Williams at WTRG said.  They just got access to a new pipeline, which will reduce the cost of transporting their crude by train,  he said, referring to the Dakota Access pipeline that entered service at the start of June. The break even price for drilling new wells in the United States varies considerably among shale formations and even between different parts of the same play, but most analysts say producers need U.S. crude prices of $45-$50.  However, consultancy Rystad Energy, which specializes in exploration and production, said wellhead break-evens average around $38 per barrel for the Bakken shale wells completed in 2016-2017.

I don't think there is an immediate need to do something, I don't think we are behind the curve, but I do think this gradual reduction of accommodation ... makes sense to me,  said Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester.  Asked what would dissuade her from backing another rate hike and the beginning of shedding bonds this year, she told reporters:  I'd have to see that there is really a sharp decline in demand ... coupled with weak inflation data.   Fed policy will ultimately depend on data, said Mester, who votes on policy next year under a rotation.  What people forget is that we've incorporated in that gradual (median) path some of the fact that inflation is gradually coming back up to target. We've already hedged that,  she added.

Drillers added 11 oil rigs in the week to June 23, bringing the total count up to 758, the most since April 2015, energy services firm Baker Hughes Inc said in its closely followed report on Friday.  That is more than double the same week a year ago when there were only 330 active oil rigs. Drillers have added rigs in 52 of the past 56 weeks since the start of June 2016.  The higher rig count this week reflects decisions made a couple of months ago when oil prices were higher,  said James Williams, president of WTRG Economics in Arkansas, noting he expects the current low prices to cause the count to fall in some weeks over the next month or two. U.S. crude futures were trading around $43 per barrel, which puts the front-month on track for a fifth consecutive week of declines and close to a 10-month low as OPEC-led production cuts have failed to reduce a global crude glut.  After agreeing in December to cut production by around 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) from January-June, OPEC and other producers in late May agreed to extend those cuts for another nine months through the end of March 2018. Analysts said those OPEC-led cuts were being frustrated by rising output from U.S. shale drillers and other producers hoping to capture higher oil prices in future months. Futures for the balance of 2017 were trading just over $43 a barrel, while calendar 2018 was fetching about $45 a barrel. Analysts said crude prices are likely to remain under pressure until there are signs the number of rigs drilling for oil in the United States is stabilizing or declining. U.S. producers are expected to increase output to 9.3 million bpd in 2017 and a record 10.0 million bpd in 2018 from 8.9 million bpd in 2016, according to federal projections.  The biggest increase in rigs this week was in the Bakken formation in North Dakota where drillers added three rigs, bringing the total there to 52, the most since December 2015 and double the same week a year ago.  It's not surprising the rig count has been rising in the Bakken because producers there will not see the full extent of the crude price drop we've had over the past month,  Williams at WTRG said.  They just got access to a new pipeline, which will reduce the cost of transporting their crude by train,  he said, referring to the Dakota Access pipeline that entered service at the start of June. The break even price for drilling new wells in the United States varies considerably among shale formations and even between different parts of the same play, but most analysts say producers need U.S. crude prices of $45-$50.  However, consultancy Rystad Energy, which specializes in exploration and production, said wellhead break-evens average around $38 per barrel for the Bakken shale wells completed in 2016-2017.

The court decided that government officials can combine separate parcels of private land in determining whether public officials have effectively taken private property through zoning laws and must pay compensation. The ruling could make it harder for property owners to prove compensation claims. The justices, in the 5-3 ruling written by conservative Justice Anthony Kennedy and joined by the court's four liberals, upheld the use of zoning regulations by Wisconsin to prevent members of the Murr family from selling the vacant lot because the four siblings also owned an adjoining parcel of land. The ruling set out a multi-factor test for courts to use to determine when a property taking requiring compensation to an owner has occurred, weighing how land is divided, its physical relationship to the surrounding environment, and the value of the land.  This is an unfortunate decision for the Murrs, and all property owners,  said John Groen, executive vice president and general counsel of the Pacific Legal Foundation, the conservative legal group that represented the family. The state's attorney general, Republican Brad Schimel, called the ruling a  victory for the rule of law in Wisconsin.  State and local governments nationwide are grappling with ways to manage urban sprawl, provide services to residents and protect the environment, often by limiting the use of private property and leading to litigation by landowners. Courts have recognized that in some cases, regulation can go so far as to deprive the owner of the value of their property, requiring compensation by the government. The legal issue behind the Murr family's case is how courts should make that call. The dispute began in 2004 when the four Murr siblings, who own two adjacent parcels of land on the St. Croix River in Troy, Wisconsin, wanted to sell an empty lot purchased by their late parents decades ago as a family investment, hoping to fund repairs to their family cabin on the adjacent parcel. Citing zoning regulations, county officials told them it was too small to develop and they would have to sell it with the adjacent lot. The Murrs sued, alleging that the government had effectively taken the land without compensation. Without the ability to sell or develop the lot, it had been rendered economically useless, they said. A Wisconsin appeals court sided with the state and local county in 2014, saying officials had not deprived the family of their property because both lots were contiguous and could be sold or developed together. The family appealed to the Supreme Court. Their position was supported by various agricultural, real estate and business groups, which argued that the Wisconsin court decision made it more difficult to prove the government unfairly deprived them of their land. Supported by the Trump administration, Wisconsin told the justices that for conservation and other reasons under state law, adjacent lots that are separately too small will be merged if they come under common ownership. Given the test laid out in the ruling, Kennedy said, the Murrs' property  should be evaluated as a single parcel.  Objecting to the test, Chief Justice John Roberts filed a dissenting opinion. Justice Neil Gorsuch, who joined the court after the case was argued, did not participate in Friday's decision.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-court-property-idUSL1N1JK0R0"},

And for Iain Murray, the man running the event, the key to making the 35th America's Cup a success has been to have the rules spelt out in  black and white  before crews even took to the crystal-clear waters of Bermuda. That means reams of protocols and instructions that can be understood and adhered to by competitors, reducing the need for  subjective  decisions. The umpires are also using a state-of-the art combination of GPS, electronics and graphics to ensure decisions are accurate.  Essentially, it's the same technology that sends a missile into someone's lounge room,  Murray told Reuters on Friday at Bermuda's Dockyard, where the America's Cup finalists Emirates Team New Zealand and holders Oracle Team USA will resume battle for international sport's oldest trophy this weekend. The regatta director has had some tough calls to make.  The hard one here has been the upper wind limit ... the day it came into question was the day that New Zealand capsized. For some people, it was my fault, but the rules had been modified a week before to actually lower the wind limits and to make it very clear,  he said. The New Zealand crew  pitch poled  - making a spectacular high-speed forward capsize - just before they were about to start a semi-final against Britain's Land Rover BAR (Ben Ainslie Racing) boat. Some of the six crew were plunged into the water and others left clinging to the upended hull of their 50-foot (15-metre) foiling catamaran. The capsize brought back memories from San Francisco in 2013, when Andrew  Bart  Simpson was killed in a similar incident.  It's the same issue we went through in San Francisco after the fatality of Bart,  said Murray, who was a friend of the British Olympic gold medal sailor. Murray was the official who had to come up with a safety plan immediately after Simpson's death that would convince the coastguard to allow the competition to continue. The boats have evolved since 2013. They are smaller and  much more robust , and safety has been a major preoccupation for all the teams and the America's Cup organizers.  These are top-end boats, and in the wrong hands, they can be dangerous. They go fast, and when they go wrong, situations can get bad,  Murray said.  These guys are the best sailors in the world and they have worked for years to sail these boats and develop the systems on their boats. They don't want to crash their boats, they don't want to capsize. You won't win races doing that,  he added.  The difficulty is when they fall off the front or fall underneath ... that's the world of foiling sailing boats.  In recent decades foils - slender underwater  wings  that can lift a speeding vessel out of the water, minimizing its drag - have become ubiquitous in racing sailing.  Ask  Umpapp  Murray's right-hand man Richard Slater, who is chief umpire at the event, has also had some tough calls to make during the racing leading up to the America's Cup final. Slater was on the receiving end of some vocal protests by Artemis Racing's Team Manager Iain Percy during the Swedish team's semi-final races after imposing penalties on them, but said that was to be expected given the intensity of racing.  You're dealing with the heat of the battle and that's one thing, as umpires, you have to remember,  Slater told Reuters, adding that the sailors were in the  red zone  physically and this was bound to result in them reacting strongly to decisions. The umpires are armed with a graphics system called  UmpApp , which allows them to make calls based on information that is accurate to millimeters and milliseconds, and are focused on that to make sure they make the right call quickly.   If anything, when he was yelling at us we weren't even listening at that point,  Slater said, adding that the teams have access to the same information within seconds, so that they can see why a decision has been made.  UmpApp is kind of like a game,  Murray said, saying it was easy for the younger sailors to get their heads around.

The Federal Reserve should wait on any further rate increases until it is clear inflation is reliably heading to the Fed's 2 percent target, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said on Friday, highlighting the central bank's struggle over how to weigh a recent slip in the rate of price increases.

Looking ahead, market will parse Chair (Janet) Yellen next week to see if she makes any notable changes to the Fed's stance since the June meeting.      Allegations of ties to Russia have cast a shadow over U.S. President Donald Trump's first five months in office, North Korea testing a rocket engine and Brexit negotiations are all fuelling concern about global stability.      Political noise out of Washington regarding Trump's ties with Russia is unlikely to provide lasting support to gold while an escalation of the geopolitical tensions with North Korea is a bullish wild card,  Julius Baer analysts said in a note.     The dollar fell against a basket of major currencies on Friday       , on track for its biggest single-day drop in three weeks, on persistent doubts whether the Fed would raise interest rates again this year due to softening inflation data.                  Further pressuring the dollar was Markit's flash June reports on U.S. factory and services activity, which was weaker than expected, while the government said new home sales rebounded more than expected in May.                               Gold is often used by investors as a hedge against political and financial uncertainty. But it doesn't earn interest, dividends or coupons and it costs money to insure and store.     A rising U.S. currency makes dollar-denominated metals more expensive for holders of other currencies, which potentially could subdue demand.            The Fed's rate rise on June 14 saw investors sell gold.  Holdings of the largest gold-backed exchange-traded-fund (ETF), New York's SPDR Gold Trust      , have fallen to 27.456 million ounces from 27.875 million ounces on June 13.

The Governing Council of the ECB has recommended an amendment to Article 22 of the Eurosystem statute, stating that  the ECB and national central banks may provide facilities and ECB may make regulations, to ensure efficient and sound clearing and payment systems, and clearing systems for financial instruments, within the Union and with other countries.  The amendment, which follows proposed changes to the European Market Infrastructure Directive that would enhance third-country oversight and enable ESMA to force CCPs to move some euro clearing activities onshore, is subject to approval by the European Parliament and European Council. “This is a necessary legal step to give the ECB the powers and jurisdiction that it will need as the EU's institutions assert supervisory authority over third-country CCPs,  said Vincent Keaveny, partner and co-chair of financial services at DLA Piper. Speaking at a meeting of the Global Financial Markets Association in Frankfurt earlier this week, ECB executive board member Benoit Coeure said the UK's decision to leave the European Union had prompted a significant rethink of Europe's CCP supervision approach - currently based on cooperative arrangements with UK authorities and a memorandum of understanding between the ECB and Bank of England. He called recent Commission proposals to enhance third-country CCP oversight  a step in the right direction .  What concerns us today in the context of Brexit is that the current EU regime regarding third-country CCPs was never designed to cope with major systemic CCPs operating from outside the EU,  said Coeure.  Reviewing this regime has therefore become urgent in the current environment. We need to ensure we can preserve a framework that ensures the safety and stability of the financial system when the UK is no longer a member of the EU.  LCH's SwapClear currently clears more than 90% of euro-denominated interest rate swaps traded by eurozone banks. In credit default swaps, the Intercontinental Exchange's UK clearing arm is responsible for 40% of cleared activity from eurozone banks. Coeure expressed support for a framework that allows EU regulators to deny recognition to CCPs posing excessive risk to EU financial stability, ultimately forcing those entities to reestablish activities in the bloc in order to continue providing clearing services there.  This would be just one of the tools available to EU authorities under the revised EMIR proposal,  said Coeure.  I believe that such an approach will be justified in case EU authorities are unable to adequately control risks and fulfil their mandates through other means. Ultimately, however, it will be up to the Commission and the EU legislators to decide on the specific conditions for triggering such a requirement.  His comments followed criticism of CCP relocation from Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, earlier in the week. At his Mansion House speech, Carney warned that a  non-recognition approach  would split liquidity into onshore and offshore pools, potentially costing EU-based firms an additional €22bn stemming from a pricing basis that would emerge between the two markets. “Fragmentation is in no one’s economic interest. Nor is it necessary for financial stability. Indeed it can damage it,  Carney said  Fragmenting clearing would lead to smaller liquidity pools in CCPs, reducing the ability to diversify risks and diminishing resilience.” The ECB's support for a euro clearing location policy is long-standing. The central bank's 2011 Eurosystem Oversight Policy Framework aimed to force CCPs with daily net credit exposure of over €5bn in euro-denominated product categories to be legally incorporated in the eurozone. Those efforts were thwarted in 2015 by a Luxembourg court, which deemed the proposals a breach of the EU's single market rules. An enhanced framework providing greater supervisory power over third-country CCPs, which largely replicates approaches already followed by many other major jurisdictions, has been widely anticipated across the industry.  Most market participants accept that dual supervision by the EU authorities and by the UK regulators, and information sharing amongst those regulators, will be necessary after Brexit. It is still not clear whether that will be enough to satisfy all of the EU regulators,  said DLA Piper's Keaveny.

The court decided that government officials can combine separate parcels of private land in determining whether public officials have effectively taken private property through zoning laws and must pay compensation. The ruling could make it harder for property owners to prove compensation claims. The justices, in the 5-3 ruling written by conservative Justice Anthony Kennedy and joined by the court's four liberals, upheld the use of zoning regulations by Wisconsin to prevent members of the Murr family from selling the vacant lot because the four siblings also owned an adjoining parcel of land. The ruling set out a multi-factor test for courts to use to determine when a property taking requiring compensation to an owner has occurred, weighing how land is divided, its physical relationship to the surrounding environment, and the value of the land.   This is an unfortunate decision for the Murrs, and all property owners,  said John Groen, executive vice president and general counsel of the Pacific Legal Foundation, the conservative legal group that represented the family. The state's attorney general, Republican Brad Schimel, called the ruling a  victory for the rule of law in Wisconsin.  State and local governments nationwide are grappling with ways to manage urban sprawl, provide services to residents and protect the environment, often by limiting the use of private property and leading to litigation by landowners.  Courts have recognized that in some cases, regulation can go so far as to deprive the owner of the value of their property, requiring compensation by the government. The legal issue behind the Murr family's case is how courts should make that call.  The dispute began in 2004 when the four Murr siblings, who own two adjacent parcels of land on the St. Croix River in Troy, Wisconsin, wanted to sell an empty lot purchased by their late parents decades ago as a family investment, hoping to fund repairs to their family cabin on the adjacent parcel. Citing zoning regulations, county officials told them it was too small to develop and they would have to sell it with the adjacent lot.  The Murrs sued, alleging that the government had effectively taken the land without compensation. Without the ability to sell or develop the lot, it had been rendered economically useless, they said. A Wisconsin appeals court sided with the state and local county in 2014, saying officials had not deprived the family of their property because both lots were contiguous and could be sold or developed together.  The family appealed to the Supreme Court. Their position was supported by various agricultural, real estate and business groups, which argued that the Wisconsin court decision made it more difficult to prove the government unfairly deprived them of their land.  Supported by the Trump administration, Wisconsin told the justices that for conservation and other reasons under state law, adjacent lots that are separately too small will be merged if they come under common ownership. Given the test laid out in the ruling, Kennedy said, the Murrs' property  should be evaluated as a single parcel.  Objecting to the test, Chief Justice John Roberts filed a dissenting opinion. Justice Neil Gorsuch, who joined the court after the case was argued, did not participate in Friday's decision.

The company reported that software and professional sales fell 4.7 percent to $101 million during the first quarter. Investors pay close attention to that category because growth of high-margin software sales is at the heart of Chief Executive Officer John Chen's turnaround strategy for the company. Its stock had gained about 60 percent over the past quarter on expectations that sales of new software products are starting to take off.   This is a big disappointment for the stock and likely to cast a pall on the sustainability of the turnaround,  said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer with Solaris Asset Management who helps manage $1.5 billion.  The Waterloo, Ontario-based company is focused on expanding sales to automakers and other manufacturers, and expanding in cyber security market, after ceding the smartphone market to rivals including Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS). 'Organic' Growth Chen said at a news conference that the company had  organic growth  in software sales of 12 percent, after adjusting for deferred-revenue from an acquisition in the year-earlier quarter.  He added that the company would have to  play catch up  to meet its goal of boosting software and services revenue by 10 percent to 15 percent this year:  We intend to do that.”  Chen also said the first-quarter drop was due to a decline in professional services, which went from $27 million in the fourth quarter to  almost nothing  in the first quarter.

A year to the day after Britons voted narrowly for Brexit, May admitted differences at the Brussels summit over guarantees to the 3 million EU expatriates in Britain, but said they would be addressed in negotiations begun this week. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said it was a  good start  but  not a breakthrough, to say the least . Summit chair Donald Tusk, a former Polish premier, found it  below expectations  and said it could leave people, including 800,000 Poles, worse off.  It's obvious that this is about reducing the citizens' rights,  Tusk told reporters of his  first impression  of May's offer.  Our role in negotiations is to reduce this risk.  May, facing the first European test of her authority after an election backfire cost her a parliamentary majority, pushed back, calling her proposal a  fair and serious offer .   Those citizens from EU countries that have come to the United Kingdom and who've made their lives and homes in the United Kingdom will be able to stay, and we will guarantee their rights in the United Kingdom,  she said.   There are some differences between that and the proposals of the European Commission, but the matter will now go into the negotiations.  Sitting alongside new French President Emmanuel Macron at joint news conference, Merkel said:  It became clear during the discussion last night that we have a long path ahead of us.   And the 27, especially Germany and France, will be well prepared, we will not allow ourselves to be divided.  Many leaders want to see details that May promised for Monday, including the nitty-gritty of how complex, multinational families would fare and what judicial oversight there would be. Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel was among the most skeptical, wary of getting a nasty  cat-in-the-bag  surprise.  For Poland, Deputy Foreign Minister Konrad Szymanski said:  We appreciate the effort but the offer does not meet all the criteria the EU agreed on as red lines.  British Prime Minister Theresa May shakes hands with European Council President Donald Tusk at the EU summit in Brussels, Belgium, June 23, 2017.Gonzalo FuentesJudges' Role In particular, the EU 27 want their citizens to be able to enforce their rights in Britain through the European Court of Justice, something May has ruled out. They also dispute her attempt to potentially limit those rights to people already living in Britain before she triggered Brexit three months ago. EU chief executive Jean-Claude Juncker said he could not imagine people not having recourse to the European Court of Justice. The Union wants the ECJ to be the arbiter of the Brexit treaty. That would mean Luxembourg judges retaining a role in the lives of EU expatriates in Britain -- as now, via British courts. At the end of a Brussels summit dinner on Thursday, May had outlined five principles. These were notably that no EU citizen resident in Britain at a cut-off date would be deported and that those who had lived in Britain for five years could stay for life -- a right foreigners already have in the rest of the EU.   Slideshow (6 Images)Those more recently arrived would be allowed to stay until they reach the five-year threshold for  settled status . Red tape for permanent residency would be cut and there would be a two-year grace period to avoid  cliff edge  mishaps.[nL8N1JJ5L7] Nonetheless, some EU migrants to Britain still believed they would be required to leave.  I don't feel safe with (May's offer) because I haven't been living here for five years. She hasn't been clear enough for me,  said 26-year-old Italian cafe worker Michele Paoletti.  Paoletti, who moved to Britain in 2014, now intends to move to the Netherlands with his Dutch wife and son. Weakened by an election she did not need to call, May has watered down her government's program to try to get it through parliament and set a softer tone in her approach to Brexit, which she had opposed prior to last year's referendum. Yet her aims have held. She wants a clean break from the bloc, leaving the lucrative single market and customs union and so reducing immigration and ending EU courts' jurisdiction. However, her political weakness have generated concern that the divorce may not be orderly. Manfred Weber, German leader of conservatives in the European Parliament which must approve any Brexit deal, said the lack of detail in May's rights proposals was  quite worrying for the rest of the negotiations . Describing  an island in chaos  compared to a continent growing in confidence in its economy and leaders like Macron, Weber said:  It still seems that the UK government has no idea what they want to achieve.

The breakeven price at the Loma Campana field is $43 per barrel and falling while development costs are $12.90 per barrel and expected to fall to $10 next year, said Pablo Bizzotto, executive manager at YPF's unconventional resources unit.  Ten dollars is world-class compared with the Permian  shale field in Texas, he told reporters this week during a tour of windswept Loma Campana, where YPF produces 40,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and co-investor Chevron Corp produces another 20,000.       If we can get there in Vaca Muerta, we're competitive,  he said, referring to Argentina's Belgium-sized shale formation of which Loma Campana was the first productive field. The cost cuts are good news for Argentine President Mauricio Macri, who has sought to attract investment to Vaca Muerta to help close Argentina's costly energy deficit since taking office in late 2015.  While the play is thought to have some of the world's largest shale oil and gas reserves, just two of its 19 concessions have moved from the pilot to production stage amid investor concerns over high labor costs and logistical difficulties in the distant Patagonian province of Neuquen. To address that, the government plans to invest $1.2 billion to renovate the 1,300 km (807.78 miles) of railroad tracks connecting Atlantic ports in Buenos Aires and Bahia Blanca to Anelo, the closest town to the oil fields, located in an isolated, flat desert region where materials needed for production arrive by truck.   It's much needed,  Bizzotto said of the train, adding that logistics account for 50 percent of the cost of sand needed for hydraulic fracturing.  It will lower logistical costs for things that should not be transported via truck, like sand and tubes.   Price Floors and Geosteering In January, Macri struck a deal to woo investments from major oil companies by ensuring attractive prices and getting unions to agree to a series of measures to lower notoriously high labor costs. As part of the deal, the government has guaranteed producers $55 per barrel for Medanito crude from July onward and $7.50 per million British thermal units of natural gas, helping companies like YPF beat their break-even costs.  Both guarantees are above market prices. On Friday, front-month Brent crude was trading at $45.37 per barrel, while natural gas futures were at $2.92 per million British thermal units. YPF's cost cuts would come mainly from drilling longer horizontal wells and drilling technology improvements, Bizzotto said. The company's horizontal wells are about 2,500 meters (8202.1 feet) long, and YPF is planning to pilot a 3,200-meter well in the second half of this year.  He also showed the company's  geosteering  project, currently in its pilot phase, in which engineers sitting in a control room with dozens of screens can remotely modify a drill's path through a well in real time. The process has increased drilling speed by 27 percent on the 10 to 15 wells where it has been used since the pilot began one year ago, Bizzotto said.   In the future, the new leap in productivity and well quality in Vaca Muerta is totally associated with geosteering,  he said.  What we are doing is profitable.  Vaca Muerta contains 308 trillion cubic feet of shale gas and 16.2 billion barrels of shale oil, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

India's air force needs hundreds of aircraft to replace its Soviet-era fleet, but Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has said foreign suppliers must build the planes in India to boost the domestic industrial base and cut outright imports. MiG General Director Ilia Tarasenko told Reuters in a written interview that his company had been cooperating with India for more than 50 years, providing planes, service and training centers, and remained upbeat about further sales.   We are not afraid of rivalry with the U.S. in this market,  he said.  On the contrary, we believe that attempts by other players to establish cooperation with this country help us to better understand their needs and better meet them.  At the same time, he conceded that Modi's  Make in India  initiative required some changes in Moscow's approach, and said his company was ready to respond.  Regarding improvements, we believe that it is necessary to further deepen cooperation within the framework of the 'Make in India' concept and are ready to take the necessary steps,  Tarasenko said. He did not elaborate. He said MiG's new MiG-35 fighter jet, which will debut at Russia's MAKS 2017 air show next month, was 20 percent cheaper to operate over its lifespan and offered countries capabilities that went beyond those of regular  fourth-generation  planes. Tarasenko said two MiG-35s should complete flight tests by the end of the year or early next, paving the way for serial production once a contract was signed with the defense ministry. At least one of the two MiG-35 jets would appear at the MAKS 2017 air show, Tarasenko said, adding that MiG met with 20 potential customers during the Paris event and expected to make its first exports in 2020. He did not name potential customers. Tarasenko dismissed the importance of grouping jets into  generations,  and said the MiG-35 was already  stronger, smarter and more versatile  than fourth-generation jets, but not as expensive as fifth-generation aircraft that can evade radar.  It will be barely noticeable on the radar - due to the reduction of the reflecting surface, the special radio-absorbing coating, and electronic radio-suppressing equipment,  he said. The MiG's radar would be able to track up to 30 targets, and lead six of them simultaneously, with data streaming into pilots' augmented reality helmets to enable more precise missile firing. In addition, he said the aircraft could take on more fuel in mid-air and refuel other planes, had greater range and could carry up to six tons of weapons.Tarasenko said Russia was already working on new aircraft that would be  smarter, faster  and with increased range and a higher top ceiling range.   We are working on perspective projects that by some characteristics are ahead of the current perception of aviation,  he said.

Britain and the EU started talks this week on the terms of their divorce in March 2019. Brexit risks an end to so-called passporting rights, through which financial institutions are able to sell their services across the EU without locally regulated operations.  Reinsurers such as Munich Re (MUVGn.DE) and Scor (SCOR.PA), who help insurers pay for big claims like hurricanes in exchange for part of the premium, technically do not need passporting rights to operate cross-border in the large marine, aviation and transport sectors.  But without regulatory regimes in Britain and the EU that are formally recognized as equivalent to one another, reinsurers based in Britain may have difficulty doing business in some EU markets due to differing national regulations, industry sources say. Reinsurers outside Britain could also find it harder to get involved in deals led by the Lloyd's of London [LOL.UL] market.  The UK's withdrawal from the EU raises difficult questions about the future trading relationship between the two jurisdictions,  the Zurich-based Global Reinsurance Forum, which represents some of the world's largest reinsurers, said in the letter sent in April.  If passporting arrangements for EU reinsurers into the UK and vice versa are not maintained, then national regulations will inevitably make cross-border reinsurance between the two jurisdictions more difficult and expensive.  The letter called for existing arrangements to continue under a future UK/EU trade deal. The reinsurers rejected suggestions by some industry participants that Britain should make major changes to EU Solvency II capital rules after Brexit, due to stringent capital costs and red tape.  We strongly support the position that the UK should continue to operate an insurance regulatory regime which is consistent with Solvency II,  they said.  The Global Reinsurance Forum is chaired by Inga Beale, chief executive of Lloyd's. Other members of the group of 13 reinsurers include Munich Re, Scor and Swiss Re (SRENH.S), as well as reinsurers based outside Europe. Its main aim is  to promote a stable, innovative, and competitive worldwide reinsurance market,  according to its website.

The company reported that software and professional sales fell 4.7 percent to $101 million during the first quarter. Investors pay close attention to that category because growth of high-margin software sales is at the heart of Chief Executive Officer John Chen's turnaround strategy for the company. Its stock had gained about 60 percent over the past quarter on expectations that sales of new software products are starting to take off.   This is a big disappointment for the stock and likely to cast a pall on the sustainability of the turnaround,  said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer with Solaris Asset Management who helps manage $1.5 billion.  The Waterloo, Ontario-based company is focused on expanding sales to automakers and other manufacturers, and expanding in cyber security market, after ceding the smartphone market to rivals including Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS). 'Organic' Growth Chen said at a news conference that the company had  organic growth  in software sales of 12 percent, after adjusting for deferred-revenue from an acquisition in the year-earlier quarter.  He added that the company would have to  play catch up  to meet its goal of boosting software and services revenue by 10 percent to 15 percent this year:  We intend to do that.”  Chen also said the first-quarter drop was due to a decline in professional services, which went from $27 million in the fourth quarter to  almost nothing  in the first quarter.   A lot of the newer markets BlackBerry is trying to position around are longer-term markets ... Managing short-term, quarter-on-quarter performance in light of that trajectory is going to be a challenge,  said Nick McQuire, vice president for enterprise research at CCS Insight. BlackBerry's U.S.- and Toronto-listed shares were down about 10 percent after falling as much as 13 percent, their biggest respective one-day falls since January 2015. The company reported revenue on adjusted basis of $244 million for the quarter ended May 31, missing analysts' estimates of $264.5 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  It reported a quarterly profit of $671 million, or $1.23 per share, compared with a loss of $670 million, or $1.28 per share, a year earlier.

Briton Ennis-Hill, 31, was upgraded to a gold medal for the heptathlon event in 2011 after Russian winner Tatyana Chernova was stripped of her title in November for a doping violation. However, Chernova has appealed her case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in Switzerland and that means Coe and the sport's world ruling body are currently unable to re-allocate her medal. An IAAF spokesman told Reuters that it was impossible to redistribute medals when cases remain in front of CAS.  Everyone in athletics wants to see the right athletes with the right medal and we are working on a specific policy for the reallocation of medals,  the spokesman said.  In the meantime we want to find the right moment to give athletes the recognition they missed out on and fans of the sport a chance to be part of that celebration wherever we can and if the athlete wants us to.

The dollar fell against a basket of major currencies as preliminary data on U.S. factory and services activities in June fell short of analyst forecasts, stoking doubts about U.S. economic growth for the rest of 2017. That drop in the greenback helped crude oil pull away from 10-month lows, although prices were still set for their worst first-half performance since 1997. On the week, both Brent and WTI crude have lost nearly 4 percent.  In relative terms, it is not such a big move,  said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade in Chicago.  Part of the reason it sparked oil a little bit is it’s the end of the week, there was a big selloff, so I imagine you are just seeing people flatten some positions.  U.S. crude rose 0.58 percent to $42.99 per barrel and Brent was last at $45.50, up 0.62 percent on the day. The climb in crude helped lift energy stocks on Wall Street, with the group up 0.5 percent. The U.S. dollar briefly managed to recoup some of its declines after economic data showed new U.S. single-family home sales rose in May and the median sales price surged to an all-time high. The PHLX housing index advanced 0.6 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 13.75 points, or 0.06 percent, to 21,411.04, the S&P; 500 gained 6.74 points, or 0.28 percent, to 2,441.24 and the Nasdaq Composite added 31.89 points, or 0.51 percent, to 6,268.57. The slide in energy prices in recent weeks has worsened the outlook for inflation, creating a problem for the world's major central banks as they attempt to normalize interest rates after years of ultra-loose policy. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index lost 0.28 percent and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.26 percent. The dollar index fell 0.33 percent, with the euro up 0.41 percent to $1.1196. The dollar hit a one-month high on Tuesday following comments with a hawkish tone from Fed officials including New York Fed President William Dudley and Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren. But it has been stuck in a tight range since and is up slightly on the week. Earlier on Friday, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said the central bank should wait on any further rate increases until it is clear inflation is reliably heading to the Fed's 2 percent target. Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said failure to hike rates in the U.S. could mean missing inflation and employment goals that could cause a recession. Fed Board Governor Jerome Powell is also due to speak on Friday. The lower dollar also helped boost gold prices, but the prospect of further interest rate rises in the United States limited gains. Spot gold added 0.4 percent to $1,255.34 an ounce. U.S. gold futures gained 0.54 percent to $1,256.20 an ounce.

India's air force needs hundreds of aircraft to replace its Soviet-era fleet, but Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has said foreign suppliers must build the planes in India to boost the domestic industrial base and cut outright imports. MiG General Director Ilia Tarasenko told Reuters in a written interview that his company had been cooperating with India for more than 50 years, providing planes, service and training centers, and remained upbeat about further sales.   We are not afraid of rivalry with the U.S. in this market,  he said.  On the contrary, we believe that attempts by other players to establish cooperation with this country help us to better understand their needs and better meet them.  At the same time, he conceded that Modi's  Make in India  initiative required some changes in Moscow's approach, and said his company was ready to respond.  Regarding improvements, we believe that it is necessary to further deepen cooperation within the framework of the 'Make in India' concept and are ready to take the necessary steps,  Tarasenko said. He did not elaborate. He said MiG's new MiG-35 fighter jet, which will debut at Russia's MAKS 2017 air show next month, was 20 percent cheaper to operate over its lifespan and offered countries capabilities that went beyond those of regular  fourth-generation  planes. Tarasenko said two MiG-35s should complete flight tests by the end of the year or early next, paving the way for serial production once a contract was signed with the defense ministry. At least one of the two MiG-35 jets would appear at the MAKS 2017 air show, Tarasenko said, adding that MiG met with 20 potential customers during the Paris event and expected to make its first exports in 2020. He did not name potential customers. Tarasenko dismissed the importance of grouping jets into  generations,  and said the MiG-35 was already  stronger, smarter and more versatile  than fourth-generation jets, but not as expensive as fifth-generation aircraft that can evade radar.  It will be barely noticeable on the radar - due to the reduction of the reflecting surface, the special radio-absorbing coating, and electronic radio-suppressing equipment,  he said. The MiG's radar would be able to track up to 30 targets, and lead six of them simultaneously, with data streaming into pilots' augmented reality helmets to enable more precise missile firing. In addition, he said the aircraft could take on more fuel in mid-air and refuel other planes, had greater range and could carry up to six tons of weapons.Tarasenko said Russia was already working on new aircraft that would be  smarter, faster  and with increased range and a higher top ceiling range.   We are working on perspective projects that by some characteristics are ahead of the current perception of aviation,  he said.

The study tested snap judgments made by youngsters ages 9 to 11 right after they’d seen pictures of children with varied body shapes. Participants were briefly shown pictures of older children who were similar to each other in age, race and sex but of different weights. Right after that, they briefly viewed images of meaningless fractals and were asked to rate these abstract geometric patterns as “good” or “bad.” After seeing pictures of healthy weight children, the participants gave 64 percent of the fractals a “good” rating, compared with just 59 percent of the fractals they saw after looking at overweight children. If the participants had no implicit weight bias, researchers would expect them to rate half of the fractals “good” and the other half “bad,” the study authors say. A difference in the proportion of “good” ratings after pictures of healthy weight versus overweight children, however, indicates implicit bias. “What’s surprising here is that the bias is similar to that seen for race, and shows us that even kids already have strong preferences based on weight,” said lead study author Asheley Cockrell Skinner of Duke University in Durham, North Carolina.  The children had to make their judgments in a hurry. They only saw pictures of other children for 350 milliseconds, followed by an image of a fractal for 200 milliseconds.  Each participant viewed eight pairs of images. Pictures showed children engaged in a variety of activities like reading, running, standing and studying. In the pictures, children wore similar outfits and had similar facial expressions.  The difference in percentages of “good” fractal ratings - that is, the degree of young participants’ implicit bias - depended on how much the participants themselves weighed. Overall, the implicit bias rate was 5.4 percent, researchers report in Pediatrics. But among healthy-weight participants, the implicit bias rate was 7.9 percent, compared with 1.4 percent for overweight participants.  “It’s possible children with obesity have greater exposure to other people, such as family members, who have obesity; (they) may be more accepting of obesity; or healthy children may not see children with obesity as `like them,’ which affects their preferences,” Skinner said by email.  Beyond its small size, other limitations of the study include its group of mostly white, affluent participants recruited from a single location, the authors note. This might mean the results would be different in a more diverse group of children.  Still, the findings add to a growing body of evidence suggesting that weight bias starts early, said Rebecca Pearl, a researcher at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania who wasn’t involved in the study.  “Prior research has shown that children as young as preschool age show preferences for thin versus overweight peers,” Pearl, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.  Parents can influence this, however, said Dr. Anne McTiernan, of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. “Parents should teach their children to be accepting of people of all sizes,” McTiernan, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email. “They can also screen for images their children see on TV and on the Internet.” They should also lead by example, said Justin Ryder, a pediatrics researcher at the University of Minnesota Medical School who wasn’t involved in the study.  “Using terms like fat, unhealthy, lazy, bad, ugly, etc. in reference to a person struggling with being overweight or obese is likely to build a negative attitude toward that people of that body shape over time,” Ryder said by email. “Parents likely do not realize their own implicit bias toward persons who are overweight or obese, making this a challenge.” SOURCE: bit.ly/2t2NDdz Pediatrics, online June 23, 2017.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-kids-weight-prejudice-idUSKBN19E23F"},

Matshidiso Rebecca Moeti visited Bangui this week for the launch of the country's latest health development plan, as renewed fighting swept the country.  I think it's fair to say that the security situation is extremely worrying as far as delivery of health services is concerned,  she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in a phone interview from the capital Bangui at the end of her visit. After more than four years of violence that have caused  extensive degradation  of health services, Central African Republic's new national plan aims to re-establish public health systems and infrastructure, the WHO said in a statement. The plan also seeks to bolster the fight against HIV/AIDS, which affects almost one in 20 people in the country, and improve treatment of epidemics such as cholera, measles and meningitis. Clashes between rival armed factions are cutting off humanitarian access to civilians most in need of help, while emboldened fighters are infiltrating camps for the displaced, aid agencies said on Thursday, despite militias signing a peace deal this week aimed at ending years of bloodshed. [nL8N1JJ4ET] Moeti's visit was limited to Bangui, one of the few parts of the country where the government still retains control.  There, tens of thousands of displaced people have been returning to their neighborhoods in recent months, after years sheltering in the city's mosques, churches, the airport and other makeshift camps.   When people are in these camps, the humanitarian organizations have (health and other) services provided, but when they go back home, I think the services are more precarious,  Moeti said.  This underlines the importance of this re-establishment plan and having it supported, so that these services are provided where people would normally be living.  Thousands have died in a conflict that broke out after mainly Muslim Seleka rebels seized power in 2013, provoking a backlash from Christian anti-balaka militias. Across the country of 5 million access to quality basic health services remains inadequate. Moeti also launched a program to reduce maternal and infant mortality by training and hiring more health workers, nurses, doctors, gynecologists and obstetricians. Central African Republic is one of the deadliest countries in the world for mothers, with 882 maternal deaths for every 100,000 live births, the WHO said.

The world number 50, who reached his first ATP Tour final this year in Sydney and has played for Britain in the Davis Cup, released a statement at a news conference in London.  This is a very difficult day for me and I wanted to come here in person and tell you guys face to face that a few days ago I was notified that in April I tested positive for cocaine,  the 27-year-old from Birmingham said.  It's really important to know that this was taken out of competition and in a context completely unrelated to tennis.  I made a mistake and I must face up to it. I do not condone for one second that this was acceptable behavior,  Evans added.  I've let a lot of people down, my family, my coach, my team, sponsors, British tennis and my fans and I can only apologize from the bottom of my heart.  Evans, who pulled out of this week's grasscourt tournament at Queen's Club due to injury, will be provisionally suspended from June 26 and will not be able to play at next month's Wimbledon championships.  Mr Evans was charged on 16 June with an Anti-Doping Rule Violation,  the International Tennis Federation's Anti-Doping Programme (TADP) said in a statement.  Mr Evans has accepted the finding of cocaine in his sample collected on 24 April.  As positive tests for Non-Specified Substances carry a mandatory Provisional Suspension, Mr Evans will be provisionally suspended with effect from 26 June...pending determination of the case.  Best Spell Evans has enjoyed the best spell of his career in the past 18 months having dropped outside the top 700 two years ago. After reaching the final in Sydney he made the last 16 at the Australian Open where he lost to Jo-Wilfried Tsonga. At the Barcelona Open he won his first Tour-level matches on clay, reaching the last 16 before losing to Dominic Thiem. The Lawn Tennis Association (LTA) said it was  very disappointed  at the news.  We absolutely condemn any form of drug-taking and will support the process which needs to take place,  it said in a statement.  We are in touch with Dan and we will offer appropriate guidance, support and education to him on how best to address the issues he now faces.  Evans is not the first tennis player to fall foul of cocaine. Frenchman Richard Gasquet escaped with a two-and-a-half month ban in 2009 after an ITF tribunal panel ruled that he inadvertently took cocaine by kissing a woman in a nightclub. In 2007, former world number one Martina Hingis said she had tested positive for cocaine during Wimbledon that year and promptly announced her retirement from professional tennis. The Swiss five-times grand slam singles champion was banned for two years but has since returned to the tour as a successful doubles player.

Sellers using Mercado Libre and its Mercado Pago payment platform will be eligible for loans equivalent to as much as two months of their monthly sales, Ignacio Caride, head of company's Mexico operation, told Reuters in an interview. Developments in big-data analysis are helping Mercado Libre leverage information collected about its clients and their transactions in Latin America over 18 years.

Growth also remains stuck at 2 percent, and it remains unlikely that the economic proposals of the Trump administration will raise that anytime soon, said Bullard. Even policy proposals that survive Congress and have the potential to raise growth won't have an impact perhaps until 2019, he said.  They are talking about tax reform and talking about deregulation and these are good things to be working on,  said Bullard.  The earliest you would have meaningful impact is the second half of 2018 or into 2019.  That would be a blow to Trump's pledge to raise U.S. growth to 3 percent, and would leave the Fed setting policy based on the tepid 2 percent growth that has characterized the recovery.  Though the Fed has embarked on what officials see as a slow but steady march toward higher interest rates, recent weak inflation data has raised some doubts about the wisdom of further increases. The Fed has fallen short of its 2 percent inflation target for several years. As it stands, the central bank is not expected to move again on rates until December, while in the meantime taking the first gradual steps to reduce the size of its asset holdings - a policy shift that could push some longer-term interest rates higher. It is a  distinct possibility  that process could kick off at the Fed's September meeting, Bullard said.  The weak inflation readings, coupled with the possible change in the balance sheet policy, provide all the more reason for the Fed to wait on any further policy changes.  Recent inflation data have surprised to the downside and call into question the idea that U.S. inflation is reliably returning toward target,  Bullard said at an Illinois Bankers Association conference.  The Fed can wait and see how the economy develops before making any further adjustments.  The Fed raised rates at its meeting last week with only one dissenting vote. But the policy statement flagged concern over a recent fall in the Fed's preferred measure of inflation to 1.5 percent, and Fed officials since then have split between those worried the trend may persist and those who feel the Fed needs to tighten still-loose monetary policy as a precaution. Even though a low unemployment rate of 4.3 percent would, in theory, lead to higher inflation and provide a reason for raising rates now, Bullard said there is little evidence that is going to happen anytime soon. Is U.S. inflation  about to increase substantially? The short answer is no, based on current estimates of the relationship between unemployment and inflation,  he said.

The tender offer for the agreed 5.3 billion euro ($5.9 billion) deal at 66 euros per share ran through to the end of Thursday, June 22, and was made conditional on securing 67.5 percent of the shares in the drugmaker. By late Friday, they had not announced the threshold had been crossed.  We're not yet there. But hope springs eternal,  one source told Reuters.    Bain, Cinven and Stada declined to comment. By Thursday at 1030 GMT 45.3 percent of the shares had been tendered, the buyout groups said, 22 points short of the required minimum. Even though institutional investors typically tender shortly before the deadline, the bidders have grown increasingly uneasy about the slow uptake, sources close to them have told Reuters. Shares in Stada closed at 63.76 euros on Friday, under the offer price of 66 euros a share. The bid is nevertheless widely regarded as attractive, given the premium of 49 percent over the share price before initial reports emerged that a takeover was on the cards. Bain and Cinven had vied fiercely with a rival consortium comprising Advent and Permira for control of Stada.  Many buyout firms are flush with cash after recent divestments and cheap borrowing costs and they are particularly attracted to healthcare assets for their reliable cash flows that are immune to swings in the business cycle.     In early June Bain and Cinven lowered the minimum acceptance threshold from 75 percent and postponed the cut-off date by two weeks. A relatively large 27 percent of shares are held by individual non-professional investors, many of whom are elderly, according to the sources. Only about half of these retail investors are expected to tender, with the rest expected to ignore or forget letters from custodian banks informing them of the offer. Some custodian banks may take longer to notify Stada and its suitors of the shares tendered, meaning it may be Monday or Tuesday before the last shares arrive.  Some banks still send them in the post,  one investment banker said.   Complicating things further for Stada's suitors, index tracking funds that cannot tender are seen as holding about 12 percent of the shares. While German takeover rules bar Bain and Cinven from amending their offer a second time, they could make a renewed bid with Stada's approval within a year of the first attempt failing.

It is a  distinct possibility  that process could kick off at the Fed's September meeting, Bullard said.  The weak inflation readings, coupled with the possible change in the balance sheet policy, provide all the more reason for the Fed to wait on any further policy changes.  Recent inflation data have surprised to the downside and call into question the idea that U.S. inflation is reliably returning toward target,  Bullard said at an Illinois Bankers Association conference.  The Fed can wait and see how the economy develops before making any further adjustments.  The Fed raised rates at its meeting last week with only one dissenting vote. But the policy statement flagged concern over a recent fall in the Fed's preferred measure of inflation to 1.5 percent, and Fed officials since then have split between those worried the trend may persist and those who feel the Fed needs to tighten still-loose monetary policy as a precaution. Even though a low unemployment rate of 4.3 percent would, in theory, lead to higher inflation and provide a reason for raising rates now, Bullard said there is little evidence that is going to happen anytime soon. Is U.S. inflation  about to increase substantially? The short answer is no, based on current estimates of the relationship between unemployment and inflation,  he said.

The tender offer for the agreed 5.3 billion euro ($5.9 billion) deal at 66 euros per share ran through to the end of Thursday, June 22, and was made conditional on securing 67.5 percent of the shares in the drugmaker. By late Friday, they had not announced the threshold had been crossed.  We're not yet there. But hope springs eternal,  one source told Reuters.    Bain, Cinven and Stada declined to comment. By Thursday at 1030 GMT 45.3 percent of the shares had been tendered, the buyout groups said, 22 points short of the required minimum. Even though institutional investors typically tender shortly before the deadline, the bidders have grown increasingly uneasy about the slow uptake, sources close to them have told Reuters. Shares in Stada closed at 63.76 euros on Friday, under the offer price of 66 euros a share. The bid is nevertheless widely regarded as attractive, given the premium of 49 percent over the share price before initial reports emerged that a takeover was on the cards. Bain and Cinven had vied fiercely with a rival consortium comprising Advent and Permira for control of Stada.  Many buyout firms are flush with cash after recent divestments and cheap borrowing costs and they are particularly attracted to healthcare assets for their reliable cash flows that are immune to swings in the business cycle.     In early June Bain and Cinven lowered the minimum acceptance threshold from 75 percent and postponed the cut-off date by two weeks. A relatively large 27 percent of shares are held by individual non-professional investors, many of whom are elderly, according to the sources. Only about half of these retail investors are expected to tender, with the rest expected to ignore or forget letters from custodian banks informing them of the offer. Some custodian banks may take longer to notify Stada and its suitors of the shares tendered, meaning it may be Monday or Tuesday before the last shares arrive.  Some banks still send them in the post,  one investment banker said.   Complicating things further for Stada's suitors, index tracking funds that cannot tender are seen as holding about 12 percent of the shares. While German takeover rules bar Bain and Cinven from amending their offer a second time, they could make a renewed bid with Stada's approval within a year of the first attempt failing.

Under Brazilian law, any criminal charges against a sitting president must be approved by two-thirds of the lower house of Congress in order for the Supreme Court to put a leader on trial. Top prosecutor Rodrigo Janot is expected to charge Temer with receiving bribes early next week. The president is also facing accusations of racketeering and obstruction of justice. Temer's office and his attorney, Antonio Mariz, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Temer has repeatedly said he is innocent of all accuations. The investigation is hampering the president's ability to push his economic reforms through congress. Key lawmakers in Temer's alliance told Reuters this week, on condition of anonymity so they could speak freely, that they will set aside work on those proposed labor law reforms if forced to vote on criminal charges against Temer. They also said they will not even consider advancing work on pension reforms until changes to the labor law are passed. Temer is being investigated in connection with a political graft scheme involving JBS SA, the world's largest meatpacker. Company executives said in plea-bargain testimony that the president took nearly $5 million in bribes in return for help resolving tax matters, for freeing up loans from state-run banks and other matters. Joesley Batista, one of the brothers who control JBS, also made a recording of a conversation he had with Temer earlier this year. In it the president appears to condone paying off a potential witness. Batista also accused Temer and aides of negotiating millions of dollars in illegal campaign donations for his Brazilian Social Democracy Party. Lawmakers in Temer's alliance say they have the one-third of lower-house votes required to block any charges against Temer. Out of 513 deputies, leaders in the alliance said this week they have between 250 and 300 votes. But they also told Reuters they widely expected Janot to use the strategy of dragging out the charges against Temer in an effort to wear down lawmakers with multiple votes. Those ballots will be deeply unpopular with Brazilian voters who overwhelmingly believe Temer is corrupt, according to opinion polls. It also gives more time for possible new corruption revelations to surface against Temer, said another key lawmaker speaking on condition of anonymity, potentially eroding his support in the house.

Britain and the EU started talks this week on the terms of their divorce in March 2019. Brexit risks an end to so-called passporting rights, through which financial institutions are able to sell their services across the EU without locally regulated operations.  Reinsurers such as Munich Re (MUVGn.DE) and Scor (SCOR.PA), who help insurers pay for big claims like hurricanes in exchange for part of the premium, technically do not need passporting rights to operate cross-border in the large marine, aviation and transport sectors.  But without regulatory regimes in Britain and the EU that are formally recognized as equivalent to one another, reinsurers based in Britain may have difficulty doing business in some EU markets due to differing national regulations, industry sources say. Reinsurers outside Britain could also find it harder to get involved in deals led by the Lloyd's of London [LOL.UL] market.  The UK's withdrawal from the EU raises difficult questions about the future trading relationship between the two jurisdictions,  the Zurich-based Global Reinsurance Forum, which represents some of the world's largest reinsurers, said in the letter sent in April.  If passporting arrangements for EU reinsurers into the UK and vice versa are not maintained, then national regulations will inevitably make cross-border reinsurance between the two jurisdictions more difficult and expensive.  The letter called for existing arrangements to continue under a future UK/EU trade deal. The reinsurers rejected suggestions by some industry participants that Britain should make major changes to EU Solvency II capital rules after Brexit, due to stringent capital costs and red tape.  We strongly support the position that the UK should continue to operate an insurance regulatory regime which is consistent with Solvency II,  they said.  The Global Reinsurance Forum is chaired by Inga Beale, chief executive of Lloyd's. Other members of the group of 13 reinsurers include Munich Re, Scor and Swiss Re (SRENH.S), as well as reinsurers based outside Europe. Its main aim is  to promote a stable, innovative, and competitive worldwide reinsurance market,  according to its website.

Although the banks, including household names like JPMorgan Chase & Co and Bank of America Corp, would suffer $383 billion in loan losses in the Fed's most severe scenario, their level of high-quality capital would be substantially higher than the threshold that regulators demand, and an improvement over last year's level.  This year's results show that, even during a severe recession, our large banks would remain well capitalized,  said Fed Governor Jerome Powell, who leads banking regulation for the central bank.  This would allow them to lend throughout the economic cycle, and support households and businesses when times are tough.  The Fed introduced the stress tests in the wake of the financial crisis to ensure the health of the banking industry, whose ability to lend is considered crucial to the health of the economy. Since the first test was conducted in 2009, big banks have seen losses abate, loan portfolios improve and profits grow. The banks that now undergo the exam have also strengthened their balance sheets by adding more than $750 billion in top-notch capital, the Fed said. Banks and their investors have been hoping the improvements would prompt the Fed to allow them to use more capital for stock buybacks and dividends, especially as the Trump administration is seeking to relax financial regulations. Wall Street analysts and trade groups quickly cheered the results on Thursday, saying regulators should feel comfortable easing tough rules put in place since the financial crisis.  We see today's...stress test results as a positive for Trump administration efforts to deregulate the banks,  said Jaret Seiberg, a policy analyst with Cowen & Co. Rob Nichols, president and chief executive officer of the American Bankers Association, said the Fed should consider a number of recommendations recently laid out by the Treasury Department, including making the stress tests more transparent and less frequent.  From this solid foundation, the focus should now turn to what can be done to help U.S. banks promote economic growth even further,  he said. Awaiting Part Two A combination file photo shows international banks Morgan Stanley, Barclays, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Credit Suisse, Citigroup and Bank of America Merrill Lynch from Reuters archive.File photosThursday's results are the first of a two-part exam. It showed whether the banks would meet minimum requirements under the Fed's methodology, using materials they submitted. The second portion of the test, to be released on Wednesday, will show whether the Fed approves or denies banks' capital plans. Banks now have an opportunity to resubmit those plans if they find their own projections were much sunnier than the Fed's. Under the Fed's worst-case stress-test scenario, the U.S. unemployment rate more than doubles to 10 percent. A J.P. Morgan logo is seen in New York City, U.S. January 10, 2017.Stephanie KeithHowever, even with the losses in that scenario, the banks' aggregate level of high-quality capital would still cover 9.2 percent of their risk-weighted assets, according to the Fed. That is much better than the 4.5 percent threshold that regulators demand, and an improvement on the 8.4 percent common equity tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio assessed last year. Analysts say Citigroup Inc has the most to gain or lose in the stress tests. Shareholders of the fourth-largest U.S. bank have been clamoring for management to buy back more of its stock, which is trading below what its assets are worth. But the bank cannot do so without the Fed's approval. Under the Fed's examination, Citi's minimum CET1 ratio in the most stressful scenario was the highest among big Wall Street banks, at 9.7 percent. Citi's own analysis showed that metric at 10 percent. The Fed's assessment showed the other five largest banks - JPMorgan, Bank of America, Wells Fargo & Co, Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Morgan Stanley - having minimum CET1 ratios between 8.4 and 9.4 percent. Of those, Goldman Sachs had the biggest optimism gap compared with the Fed when it came to the worst-case scenario. Its model produced a 9.8 percent minimum CET1 ratio, 1.4 points better than the Fed's. Wells Fargo's metric also fared better in its own test than under the Fed's, by 0.8 of a point. Conversely, JPMorgan's analysis appeared to be more dour, with its CET1 ratio coming in 1.3 percentage points below the Fed's. Bank of America's was 0.7 of a point worse. Banks that decide to resubmit their plans can only make downward revisions to the amount of capital they plan to use, meaning management teams that were too conservative may regret their submissions even if they pass.  If there is disappointment next week,  said Seiberg,  it is likely because the banks failed to ask for big enough distributions more than it is because the Federal Reserve was too tough.

British Columbia resident Deborah Douez brought a notice of claim against Facebook in 2012, saying that her name and image were used without consent for the social media platform's  sponsored stories  product. Douez said her privacy rights under provincial law were violated, a growing concern among social media users in recent years who fear their personal information or photos will be used without their knowledge. The ads, which the company has since dropped, used Facebook members' names and pictures to advertise companies and products to other members. Menlo Park, California-based Facebook had sought to suspend Douez's lawsuit, saying that its terms of use require disputes to be resolved in the U.S. state. In a 4-3 decision, Canada's Supreme Court ruled that the clause is unenforceable. The justices wrote that there was evidence of  gross inequality of bargaining power  between individual consumers and the company, given users have little choice but to accept Facebook's terms of use. Canadian courts also have a greater interest in deciding cases that impinge on citizens' rights  because these rights play an essential role in a free and democratic society and embody key Canadian values,  the court said. A spokesman for Facebook said the company continues to believe the underlying claims are without merit, and it will defend itself  vigorously . British Columbia's top court is better placed to rule on the province's laws than a California court would be, the court said. Justices said their decision was also supported by the expense and inconvenience of having Canadians travel to California to sue Facebook being greater than any inconvenience the company would face in making its records available in British Columbia. A lower court had allowed Douez's case to be considered as a group lawsuit, but the high court did not address the issue of class action status. Facebook reached a $20 million settlement in the United States in a class action lawsuit over the use of Sponsored Stories. The settlement was given court approval in 2013.

But this could open the way for thousands, even hundreds of thousands of fighters from all over the Arab and Islamic world to participate - from Iraq, Yemen, Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan,  he said. Nasrallah has repeatedly warned Israel against attacking Lebanon, where the Iran-backed Shi'ite group is based, and from where it sends fighters to support Assad against insurgents. Experts on the group say the warnings are part of a policy of deterrence that has also included revealing some of its military capabilities. Nasrallah said in recent months Hezbollah's rocket arsenal can hit any military target in Israel, which is Lebanon's southern neighbor. He said any Israeli war with Lebanon or the Gaza Strip, which is run by the Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas, would be  very costly  and that Israel would not be able to win. Israel has targeted senior Hezbollah commanders in air raids on Syrian soil. But there has been no major confrontation between Hezbollah and Israel in Lebanon since a month-long war between the two sides in 2006.

Their gaps and inconsistencies failed to tell the full story, prompting him to extend his search. When an editor finally called time a year later, Lo submitted a review of 21 books. Now Lo, who is director of MIT’s Laboratory for Financial Engineering and chairman and chief strategist of investment adviser AlphaSimplex, has added his own tome to the pile. In “Adaptive Markets: Financial Evolution at the Speed of Thought,” he argues that it’s time to bury the efficient-market hypothesis championed by University of Chicago economist Eugene Fama. That theory posits that stock prices reflect all available information, making it impossible for an investor to consistently beat the market. Fama’s idea has faced plenty of challenges over the years, not least from the 1987 stock-market crash that saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average fall a record 22 percent in one day. Lo has delivered some of the blows. One of his early research efforts was as co-author of a 1985 paper that proved stock prices don’t fluctuate randomly. Yet the underlying assumption of efficient-market theorists – that investors are rational profit maximizers – has proved remarkably resilient. Lo is determined to shake that foundation. He starts by diving into neuroscience and evolutionary biology. Magnetic resonance imaging of test subjects in game simulations has shown that the prospect of winning money releases dopamine in the brain – the trader’s equivalent of a cocaine fix. Rather than weigh all possible options, humans make decisions using short cuts. If they didn’t, it would be hard to get dressed in the morning. In short, economic actors are human: fighting to survive, making mistakes because of their biases, yet still capable of learning and adapting. That is why markets can seem bipolar, riding the momentum of low volatility and rising prices until some factor - trivial or substantive - triggers a freakout. The story is well told, but it’s hardly new to people familiar with the work of behavioral economists like Richard Thaler and Daniel Kahneman. Indeed, any casual observer of the economy is presented with daily evidence of human frailty. The financial crisis showed how such panic can scale in today’s global markets. The question is what to do with this insight. Lo would like to see more examples like countercyclical capital buffers, which regulators have imposed on banks in an attempt to rein in excesses. He also suggests a financial version of the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board, which would investigate market crashes and provide authoritative remedies. As an investment adviser, Lo’s real interest is in the behavior of investors. He offers some interesting ideas about constructing dynamic index funds that would reduce stock market exposure when volatility spikes. Another suggestion is to create venture-capital mega-funds to place bets on, say, cancer-curing drug treatments or climate-change technologies, in the hope that a few will pay off. It sounds utopian, but Lo is determined to change that perception. Academic proponents of efficiency receive equally short shrift from Richard Bookstaber. Although he holds a Ph.D. in economics from MIT, the title page of “The End of Theory: Financial Crises, the Failure of Economics and the Sweep of Human Interaction,” leaves little doubt about which side of the debate he favors. Bookstaber covers much the same ground as Lo, but from the perspective of a financial engineer. That’s not surprising for a man who worked as a proprietary trader at Morgan Stanley and oversaw risk management at hedge fund Moore Capital. The complexity of the financial system and the ability of traders to find ways around static rules demands agility from managers and regulators. Bookstaber’s proposed solution is agent-based modeling, which eschews fixed rules for computer models that mimic how institutions behave and react to changing market conditions. Think narrative, not mathematics, says the self-proclaimed frustrated novelist. The aim is to provide a kind of weather forecast for financial markets. The idea has been around for some time. Lo did some pioneering work in the late 1990s. At the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Financial Research, where he works, Bookstaber wrote a 2014 paper on the use of agent-based models to try to avert funding crises like the one that brought down Lehman Brothers. The devilish thing about behavior, though, is that humans can adapt to almost anything. Models can be helpful and regulators should think about how real bankers, traders and investors behave. But any successful attempt at reducing risk has the potential to breed complacency. Hyman Minsky wrote that financial stability carries the seeds of its own demise because it encourages risk taking. It’s a simple yet profound behavioral insight that neither Lo nor Bookstaber bothers to mention. It’s a curious oversight, but one that can be forgiven.

British Columbia resident Deborah Douez brought a notice of claim against Facebook in 2012, saying that her name and image were used without consent for the social media platform's  sponsored stories  product. Douez said her privacy rights under provincial law were violated, a growing concern among social media users in recent years who fear their personal information or photos will be used without their knowledge. The ads, which the company has since dropped, used Facebook members' names and pictures to advertise companies and products to other members. Menlo Park, California-based Facebook had sought to suspend Douez's lawsuit, saying that its terms of use require disputes to be resolved in the U.S. state. In a 4-3 decision, Canada's Supreme Court ruled that the clause is unenforceable. The justices wrote that there was evidence of  gross inequality of bargaining power  between individual consumers and the company, given users have little choice but to accept Facebook's terms of use. Canadian courts also have a greater interest in deciding cases that impinge on citizens' rights  because these rights play an essential role in a free and democratic society and embody key Canadian values,  the court said. A spokesman for Facebook said the company continues to believe the underlying claims are without merit, and it will defend itself  vigorously . British Columbia's top court is better placed to rule on the province's laws than a California court would be, the court said. Justices said their decision was also supported by the expense and inconvenience of having Canadians travel to California to sue Facebook being greater than any inconvenience the company would face in making its records available in British Columbia. A lower court had allowed Douez's case to be considered as a group lawsuit, but the high court did not address the issue of class action status.

The verdict by a federal jury in Kansas City, Kansas, was announced by lawyers for the farmers, who blamed the Swiss company for causing catastrophic damage to them after Chinese officials began refusing U.S. corn shipments in 2013. Their case was the first to go to trial. Thousands of other corn producers and traders also are seeking damages over China's non-approval of the agrochemical giant's corn seeds for importation. Lawyers for the corn producers said in a statement that the verdict was  only the beginning.  They have claimed that damages for farmers nationally totaled $5.77 billion, according to court papers. Syngenta said it will appeal the verdict, which included only compensatory damages and no punitive damages.  We are disappointed with today's verdict because it will only serve to deny American farmers access to future technologies even when they are fully approved in the U.S.,  Syngenta said in a statement. In 2010, Syngenta began selling in the United States a strain of insect-resistant genetically modified corn called Agrisure Viptera. It started selling a second strain called Agrisure Duracade in 2013. In their lawsuit, the Kansas corn farmers accused Syngenta of negligently commercializing the corn seeds before obtaining export approval in China, a major importer. In 2013, Chinese officials detected Viptera in U.S. corn shipments. The country began rejecting shipments containing millions of metric tons of U.S. corn because they contained the strain, which was unapproved for import, the farmers said. Nearly 90 percent of corn in the United States, the world's top grains producer, is now genetically engineered, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, as farmers embrace technology that helps kill weeds and fight pests. The loss of the Chinese market caused U.S. corn prices to plummet, leading to over $5 billion in losses for corn producers, the farmers' lawyers said. China did not approve Viptera until December 2014, while Duracade is still pending approval. Syngenta denied wronging. It said at the time that no company had ever delayed launching a U.S. approved corn product in the United States just because China had yet to approve its import. It also said the decline in sales to China was offset by exports to other countries. The case is In Re: Syngenta AG MIR 162 Corn Litigation, U.S. District Court, District of Kansas, No. 14-md-02591.

Foreign investors could tell them.      While the main FTSE 100 index .FTSE has risen 17 percent over the 12 months since Britain voted to leave the European Union, this has been driven almost exclusively by a fall in sterling. In dollar terms, British stocks have underperformed every developed index in the world.   Even at the level of British equity sectors, the picture is similar: companies earning sterling - down 14.3 percent against the dollar GBP=D3 and 13.2 percent against the euro since the June 23, 2016 vote - have underperformed dollar earners. The worst performers are telecoms .MIGB0TC00PGB and utilities <.MIGB0UT00PGB >, both focused on the British economy. Top of the pile are materials companies .MIGB0MT00PGB, which include dollar-earning miners. They have outperformed the MSCI UK index .MIGB00000PUS. Data from Bats Europe, a stock exchange and index provider, shows that FTSE-listed companies that generate a large portion of their revenues from the UK are actually flat, whereas those with a high percentage of revenues from abroad are up 26 percent.      Keeping Safe Another clear winner has been British government debt, a low-risk investment sought in uncertain times.   The yield on 10-year gilts, which moves inversely to price, has dropped by a quarter over the past year while German and U.S. equivalents have risen. GB10YT=RR DE10YT=RR US10YT=RR  Gilts will outperform as growth will ultimately disappoint and increase the risk of a harder Brexit outcome,  said Morgan Stanley market strategist Andrew Sheets. In dollar terms, the 4.2 percent returns on gilts is still better than those on both U.S. Treasuries and German Bunds. Brexit negotiations began this week, against the backdrop of political uncertainty, with British Prime Minister Theresa May trying to forge a deal with a small Northern Ireland party to prop up her minority government after the June 8 snap election delivered a hung parliament.  The picture is further clouded by an apparent split in opinion at the Bank of England on the future path for rates.  Three British rate-setters said earlier this month that rates should start to rise for the first time in a decade, but BoE Governor Mark Carney doused speculation this week that he might soon back this view.

Drillers added 11 oil rigs in the week to June 23, bringing the total count up to 758, the most since April 2015, energy services firm Baker Hughes Inc         said in its closely followed report on Friday. RIG-OL-USA-BHI      That is more than double the same week a year ago when there were only 330 active oil rigs. Drillers have added rigs in 52 of the past 56 weeks since the start of June 2016.     U.S. crude futures        were trading around $43 per barrel on a lift from a falling dollar but remained down for a fifth week in a row and close to a 10-month low as OPEC-led production cuts have failed to reduce a global crude glut.           After agreeing in December to cut production by around 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) from January-June, OPEC and other producers in late May agreed to extend those cuts for another nine months through the end of March 2018.                  Analysts said those OPEC-led cuts were being frustrated by rising output from U.S. shale drillers and other producers hoping to capture higher oil prices in future months.     Futures for the balance of 2017           were trading just over $43 a barrel, while calendar 2018           was fetching about $45 a barrel.     Analysts said crude prices are likely to remain under pressure until there are signs the number of rigs drilling for oil in the United States is stabilizing or declining.                  U.S. producers are expected to increase output to 9.3 million bpd in 2017 and a record 10.0 million bpd in 2018 from 8.9 million bpd in 2016, according to federal projections.               The break even price for drilling new wells in the United States varies considerably among shale formations and even between different parts of the same play, but most analysts say producers need U.S. crude prices of $45-$50.     However, consultancy Rystad Energy, which specializes in exploration and production, said wellhead break-evens average around $38 per barrel for the Bakken shale wells completed in 2016-2017.

Neither the White House, nor the Trump family's commercial empire, has given permission for the rebranding of the village, still better known locally as Marora, the charity said.

Such a step might spur rich people, companies and other donors to come forward and donate money,  he said.   Once basic infrastructure is built here, the popularity of this village will grow and it will act as a motivational factor.  The change is purely symbolic - the name Marora will continue to appear on maps and signs.

A toilet is being constructed, a road is being built and community hall will also be built in the village,  he said.     The event was organized as Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi prepares to fly this weekend for his first meeting with Trump in Washington.

He started the scoring with a two-run homer in the first inning and has now hit each of his 13 homers this season on the road. The last homer he hit at home was Sept. 15, 2016, against Cleveland. Abreu has hit .395 with three home runs, 13 RBIs and 10 runs scored over the last 10 games. 3B Matt Davidson had three hits on Thursday, including his seventh homer in his past 10 games. The three hits matched a career-high done on April 27. Davidson leads Chicago in homers and is second to New York's Aaron Judge in homers among American League rookies.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/bbo-whitesox-playerwatch-idUSMTZED6N0F9Q58"},

Everyone deserve a day off, even Jose Altuve,   Astros manager A.J. Hinch said before a 12-9 win.  Can you give him a better day off than a 12:30 game in Oakland? After a night game? It's like the ultimate tip your cap of respect.  Altuve is batting .322 with 20 doubles, 10 home runs, 34 RBIs and 47 runs. He appeared in 72 of the Astros' first 73 games with 70 starts. OF George Springer was hit by a pitch while leading off in the top of the first inning against Oakland and left the game with a left hand contusion. X-rays were negative, and Springer is day to day. He hopes to play Friday when the Astros begin a three-game series at Seattle.  It hurt a little bit, but I'll be OK,  Springer said.  I got lucky. I'm all right. I'll see how I feel tomorrow.  Springer has 21 home runs and a major-league high eight leadoff blasts. He was hit by A's right-hander Jesse Hahn's 92 mph 3-1 fastball. The pitch sailed high and tight. Springer was replaced by pinch-runner Jake Marisnick and went to the clubhouse accompanied by a team trainer. INF/OF Marwin Gonzalez went 2-for-5 with a three-run homer in the second inning of a 12-9 win over Oakland on Thursday afternoon. Gonzalez's home run was his 13th of the season in just 58 games. He's batting .312 with nine doubles and 40 RBIs. OF Jake Marisnick went 2-for-4 with a three-run homer, his career-high 10th home run of the season, in the second inning of a 12-9 victory over Oakland on Thursday afternoon. Marisnick didn't start the game but came on as a pinch runner in the first inning after CF George Springer was hit by a pitch on his left hand while leading off. Marisnick remained in the game in center.  It's something you never want to see,  Marisnick said of Springer getting hit.  Luckily, it sounds like everything is all right. He came out and was supporting us so that was good to see him.  RHP David Paulino (2-0) allowed three runs and seven hits in 5 1/3 innings in a 12-9 victory over the Oakland A's on Thursday afternoon at Oakland Coliseum. Paulino, a rookie, struck out six and walked one. He was coming off his first career major-league victory, a 7-1 win over Boston on Saturday. Now he has his first winning streak in the big leagues. The Astros gave Paulino a 10-0 lead after two innings.  I thought he did a good job of competing and using all of his pitches, even though he had a 10-run lead,  Astros manager A.J. Hinch said.  It's hard in general to pitch with that big a lead when you're young. Sometimes you go one of two ways. You get a little bit too careful and you get too greedy, or you throw the ball right down the middle and end up getting hit around a little bit. He did a good job of mixing his pitches. He landed his breaking ball well. His changeup was better again.  RHP Charlie Morton was sent on a rehab assignment to Triple-A Fresno. He has been on the disabled list since May 28. OF Josh Reddick went 3-for-4 with a double, a triple and a solo home run, his seventh blast of the season, in a 12-9 victory Thursday afternoon over Oakland, his former team. Reddick also walked and scored four times, matching his career high. He came up a single shy of hitting for his first career cycle. Reddick hoped to get another at-bat in the ninth inning, but he was in the hole when Houston made its third out.  I think anybody would want to have a shot at it just to see,  Reddick said.  Once you get to that one, you want to see the boys bat around for you and get up there to get the opportunity to do it. I got asked a few times if I was going to stop if it was in the gap. I was, like, 'Nah, I can't do that.' If it's in the gap, I'm going two. I don't have it in me to be that guy to get the personal goal.

It was his 12th since being acquired by Atlanta on April 21. His 12 home runs are tied for the most through a player's first 31 games in franchise history, matching the mark set by Justin Upton in 2013. RHP Mike Foltynewicz (4-5, 4.37 ERA) will make his 13th start on Friday. He is 1-0 with a 3.86 ERA in four starts this month. After back-to-back starts with seven shutout innings against the Reds and Phillies, he was rocked for eight runs in 3 1/3 innings against the Nationals.

Get everybody acclimated to each other and the game up here, I feel like we could potentially set up a turning point for this organization for years to come.

In recent weeks, his playing time had been reduced. Vogt, in a conference call, said he  could see  the move coming.  It's something I understand, although I don't like it,  said Vogt, who had been one of the A's biggest leaders. The A's continued their youth movement, recalling C Bruce Maxwell from Triple-A Nashville. Maxwell, a left-handed hitter, like Vogt, will likely get most of the starts against right-handed pitchers.

I really don't have an answer for it,  Hahn said.   I just didn't have good stuff.

However, drilling a hole into that hopeful scenario is the current bear market in oil prices and an economy showing signs of growth below the pace expected earlier in the year.  A lot of the expectation for a recovery in earnings is predicated on oil prices being around $47-$50 a barrel,  said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer of Hugh Johnson Advisors LLC in Albany, New York.  So if you don't get those numbers, you don't get the strong earnings the stock market needs. This is not trivial stuff. It creates a lot of uncertainty and volatility in forecasts.  U.S. crude futures CLc1 have been pressured lower by a supply glut. They've averaged over $48 per barrel so far this quarter, but traded around $43 on Friday and are down more than 20 percent from February, when they hit an 18-month high. U.S. stocks are in the ninth year of a bull run which has been fueled of late by bets on pro-growth policies from U.S. President Donald Trump. However, with the timetable for reforms stretching further into the future, earnings are seen as a critical support for stock prices. With indexes near record highs, there is speculation among Wall Street analysts about whether a correction is due. Earnings expectations have dropped for 10 of 11 industry groups since early April, with only industrials looking better than they did then. The benchmark S&P; 500 stock index as a whole is expected to deliver 7.9 percent profit growth, down from 15.3 percent in the first quarter, and below the 10.2 percent forecast in April, Thomson Reuters data shows. On Thursday, Nike (NKE.N) will be the first Dow component to report earnings for the most recent quarter. The season heats up in the second week of July. Technology earnings are seen posting double-digit growth, helped by gains in semiconductor companies, and financials are close behind with estimated 8.1-percent profit growth.     While lower energy prices can help some sectors such as industrials and transports, as well as boosting consumer sentiment, high expectations for energy earnings growth mean any stumble will be felt broadly. Energy sector profits are seen up a whopping 683 percent from a year ago, when many companies posted losses, according to Thomson Reuters data. Without energy, profit growth estimates drop to 4.8 percent for the quarter. Expectations for the sector will probably have to come down for the second half of the year if low oil prices persist, said David Joy, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial in Boston.    The one wild card right now is the price of oil. Expectations that are baked into full-year forecasts assume a higher price for oil certainly than we have now,  he said.  Energy has been the weakest performing sector so far this year, with the S&P; energy index .SPNY down near 15 percent. Over-Optimistic Forecasts? The drop in oil prices notwithstanding, some analysts have cautioned that Wall Street has been too optimistic about overall earnings.  Michael Purves, chief global strategist at Weeden & Co, cut his 2017 S&P; 500 earnings estimates from $127 to $116, below the $131.51 consensus, as economic growth and inflation are not as high as expected.  I'm looking for CEOs to start taking down their forecasts for the year,  Purves said.      In fact, the Citigroup U.S. economic surprise index .CESIUSD, a gauge of economic data compared to expectations, this month fell near a six-year low. An Atlanta Federal Reserve model recently forecast second-quarter economic growth coming in at a 2.9-percent annualized pace, down from a previous 3.2 percent. Another hurdle for earnings growth: declining corporate buybacks.  Over the past two years, more than 20 percent of S&P; 500 issues have given at least a 4 percent tailwind for (earnings per share) via reduced share counts,  Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P; Dow Jones Indices, said in a note. For the first quarter of 2017, that rate fell to 14.8 percent of companies, and there are indications of  even less support  in the second quarter, he said.

Aid group Sulabh International, which says it has built 1.5 million toilets across the country, has set up  Trump Village  signs around the small community in the northern state of Haryana, each bearing a grinning portrait of the president. Neither the White House, nor the Trump family's commercial empire, has given permission for the rebranding of the village, still better known locally as Marora, the charity said. But founder Bindeshwar Pathak said he hoped the gesture would win enough publicity and good will to at least raise awareness of a major social problem.  Such a step might spur rich people, companies and other donors to come forward and donate money,  he said.   Once basic infrastructure is built here, the popularity of this village will grow and it will act as a motivational factor.  The change is purely symbolic - the name Marora will continue to appear on maps and signs. But locals said they were prepared to embrace the new title, Trump Sulabh Village in its full form, and any good things it brought with it.  All our problems such as electricity and water will be addressed by renaming,  said resident Mohammed Joharuddin. Village head Shaukat Ali also played along, saying he was grateful for the charity's work.  A toilet is being constructed, a road is being built and community hall will also be built in the village,  he said.     The event was organized as Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi prepares to fly this weekend for his first meeting with Trump in Washington. The U.S. embassy in New Delhi said it was aware but referred further inquiries to Washington. Fewer than a third of India's 1.3 billion people have access to sanitation.

It's not that they're opposed. They'd like to get certain changes. And we'll see if we can take care of that,  Trump said in an interview with Fox News that aired on Friday, calling the group of conservative lawmakers  four very good people.  Trump earlier indicated changes may be in store for the proposal unveiled by Senate Republicans on Thursday to replace former President Barack Obama's signature healthcare law. The plan would scale back aid to the poor and kill a tax on the wealthy.  I am very supportive of the Senate #Healthcarebill. Look forward to making it really special!  Trump wrote on Twitter on Thursday. The Republican bill aims to deliver on one of Trump's central campaign promises to  repeal and replace  the 2010 law that expanded coverage to millions of Americans. Its fate remained uncertain since the four lawmakers' refusal to back the Senate draft would leave Republicans short of the votes to pass it. Democrats are united in opposition to the proposal, which was worked out in secret by a group led by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Republicans view Obama's Affordable Care Act as a costly government intrusion into the private marketplace. The four holdouts, among the Senate's most conservative members, said the plan failed to rein in the federal government's role, highlighting Republicans' struggle to craft legislation to revamp a sector that accounts for one-sixth of the world's largest economy. Rand Paul, who has rejected the plan along with fellow Republican Senators Ted Cruz, Mike Lee and Ron Johnson, said fundamental problems remained that would leave taxpayers subsidizing health insurance companies.  I want the bill to look more like a repeal bill,  Paul told MSNBC on Friday. The S&P; 500 healthcare index dipped 0.3 percent at midday on Friday but was on track for a 3.4 percent gain for the week, its best week since November. 'A Good Beginning' Other Republicans appeared more willing to embrace it. Senator Bill Cassidy, who is still studying the proposal and has not yet decided how he will vote, said in several television interviews it was a good beginning.  If the concerns that I have and the others have are addressed, I think it will pass,  even if it takes longer than the Republican leaders' self-imposed deadline of July 4, he told Fox News. The White House said it is hopeful a final bill will be finished before lawmakers leave Washington later this summer. Lawmakers are scheduled to break on July 28. Spicer told Fox News on Friday he thought prospects of Senate passage were  very high,  adding:  I think we're going to get this thing done ... and hopefully by the August recess really have Obamacare repealed and replaced.  The Senate measure maintains much of the structure of a House bill passed in May but differs in several key ways.  If it passes, it would have to be reconciled with the House version before Trump could sign it into law. While Republicans control both chambers of Congress and the White House, the party's efforts to unwind Obamacare have been dogged by internal conflicts between moderate and hard-line members of the party. Trump publicly celebrated the House bill's passage, only to later criticize it in private as  mean.  This week he called for a health plan  with heart.  Democrats have sharply criticized both versions as a giveaway to the wealthy that would leave millions without health insurance. On Thursday, Obama weighed in on Facebook, writing:  If there’s a chance you might get sick, get old, or start a family – this bill will do you harm.  The Senate bill's real-world impact is still unknown, but the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office is expected to provide an estimate early next week. The CBO had found that the House bill would kick 23 million Americans off their health plans, making it unpopular with the public. Fewer than one in three Americans supports it, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling.

Notable differences in the Senate's Better Care Reconciliation Act of 2017 (BCRA), announced yesterday, are more generous tax credits for individuals designed to replace ACA subsidies, a one-year extension of the phase-out date for the current Medicaid funding mechanism, and different Medicaid inflation adjusters. Additionally, the Senate bill does not contain clauses that would let individual states waive community rating regulations. The credit implications of the differences between the bills are mixed. The Senate's more generous tax credits are likely to be credit-positive for health insurers as they would be closer to subsidies currently provided by the ACA and would more significantly reduce the out-of-pocket cost to consumers of health insurers' products. However, the inability of health insurers to divert from current community rating regulations under the Senate bill is credit-negative because it would prevent insurers from adopting the enhanced risk-based pricing differentiation available under the House bill. Differences between the Senate and House bills are also likely to have mixed credit implications on Medicaid business. The Senate bill's one-year extension of the current Medicaid funding mechanism is a modest positive since it gives health insurers and states an additional year to adapt to the legislation's changes. However, over the longer term the Senate bill could provide lower funding levels given its lower inflation adjuster. The credit profiles of large diversified health insurers are unlikely to be significantly affected by the Senate's or House's legislation. However, smaller less diverse players could be materially affected over the long term by some proposals, particularly health insurers that focus on the Medicaid market. Additionally, with such sweeping legislation, unintended and unforeseen consequences are likely to create uncertainty over the ultimate net effect on health insurers. Fitch expects the effects of both the BCRA and AHCA would be more heavily felt by the individual and Medicaid markets rather than employer group sponsored market. Individual and Medicaid business represents fairly small proportions of membership and revenues for most of the health insurers we rate. Under both the Senate and House bills, changes to Medicaid funding to rely more on per capita and block-grant funding are likely to put pressure on state budgets and adversely affect Medicaid-focused insurers. However, these adverse effects might be mitigated by states' desire for budget certainty, leading them to expand risk-sharing with private insurers as part of managed Medicaid programs.

French tycoon Vincent Bollore's merger of Havas, run by his son Yannick, with Vivendi is scheduled to close in two weeks. He controls both via stakes owned by his family-run conglomerate Bollore Group, and the 2.3 billion-euro deal consists of Vivendi buying up Bollore's stake in Havas.  Bollore's strategy is very clear. It's a wealth management strategy,  Levy said in an interview in Cannes. Asked whether this meant the transaction had no business rationale, Levy said  It's just my personal opinion.  Havas Chief Executive Yannick Bollore said on Thursday the deal to create the Vivendi-Havas entity - which would include Universal Music Group, France's biggest pay-TV group Canal Plus and Havas - could create at least 390 million euros in value. He did not elaborate. Levy also pointed to the risk of conflicts of interests because the deal would see a media group taking control of an advertising group.  This is badly perceived by advertisers, because advertisers don't like having media controlling an ad agency or an ad agency controlling media,  Levy said.  They don't like this kind of mixture because it casts suspicion on the way advertising investments are made.  Yannick Bollore, who was lined up by his father to be Vivendi's next CEO, brushed off criticism on Thursday.  The only conflict of interest concerns the media buying capabilities,  Bollore said.  Havas clients represent 0.5 percent of (Vivendi) revenue.   The engagement we have with clients is to be transparent, as we’re doing in France,  he added. WPP's boss Martin Sorrell said combining media and advertising would make sense provided it is transparent to clients. But he was sceptical about the value the deal could create.  They say by coming together, they would create value,  Sorrell said in an interview on Friday.  They had the opportunity to do that...But, you know, maybe they’ll make greater efforts this time.  Vincent Bollore, 65, has stated his plan is to hand over his majority-owned Bollore Group to his four children in 2022, the year of the conglomerate's bicentenary. Four years ago Yannick, 37, became chief executive of Havas, which is 60 percent-owned by Bollore, and last year he joined Vivendi's supervisory board, chaired by his father.

High levels of insecurity after South Sudan slipped into civil war in 2013 and escalating fighting since last year have made conditions even more challenging in the impoverished country. Millions face hunger, and an estimated 3.5 million have fled their homes - 2 million of them children, according to the United Nations.  The U.N. said this month staff working in South Sudan's health centers and schools have been forcibly recruited by armed groups, causing facilities to close.  It's a very challenging situation for the mothers and for us, the midwives, ... people are being displaced all the time,  Deng, 31, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone from Toronto where he attended an international midwifery conference. South Sudan has about 1,700 deaths per 100,000 live births, above the regional average for sub-Saharan Africa of just under 1,000, according to World Bank data.  Most of these deaths would have been prevented if the country had appropriate healthcare for pregnant women and more skilled staff during childbirth, experts say.  Babies are at greater risk too, with 25 percent dying from often preventable childhood diseases before they reach their fifth birthday.  Two Lives in One Go  The number of midwives in South Sudan has risen to more than 400 from an estimated eight when the country became independent in 2011, according to the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA). Still, less than 10 percent of women giving birth in South Sudan receive the help they need to give birth safely, according to UNFPA.    Midwives can provide the majority of the services needed for newborns and pregnant women, and women cared for by midwives are less likely to have complicated births or go into labor early. Deng said more midwives are needed to be able reach pregnant women in remote areas, so they do not have to walk for hours to get looked after.  Sometimes you have one or two midwives in each facility, which makes it impossible for them to go into the community, and (it also) makes it impossible for the mothers to get care on time,  said Deng, who works at Kuajok Hospital in the northern Warrap state. UNFPA estimates a shortfall of 350,000 midwives globally, the majority being in the world's poorer countries, which account for most childbirth-related deaths among newborns and mothers. Despite all the hurdles he faces daily in his job, Deng has never looked back.  In midwifery, you realize saving two lives in one go is a very unique opportunity... , he said.

The verdict by a federal jury in Kansas City, Kansas, was announced by lawyers for the farmers, who blamed the Swiss company for causing catastrophic damage to them after Chinese officials began refusing U.S. corn shipments in 2013. Their case was the first to go to trial. Thousands of other corn producers and traders also are seeking damages over China's non-approval of the agrochemical giant's corn seeds for importation.  Lawyers for the corn producers said in a statement that the verdict was  only the beginning.  They have claimed that damages for farmers nationally totaled $5.77 billion, according to court papers. Syngenta said it will appeal the verdict, which included only compensatory damages and no punitive damages.  We are disappointed with today's verdict because it will only serve to deny American farmers access to future technologies even when they are fully approved in the U.S.,  Syngenta said in a statement. In 2010, Syngenta began selling in the United States a strain of insect-resistant genetically modified corn called Agrisure Viptera. It started selling a second strain called Agrisure Duracade in 2013. In their lawsuit, the Kansas corn farmers accused Syngenta of negligently commercializing the corn seeds before obtaining export approval in China, a major importer. In 2013, Chinese officials detected Viptera in U.S. corn shipments.

Nearly 90 percent of corn in the United States, the world's top grains producer, is now genetically engineered, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, as farmers embrace technology that helps kill weeds and fight pests.

In a report this week on the May 2016 crash of a Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) Model S that killed a driver who was using Autopilot,  the National Transportation Safety Board demonstrated that users could mostly keep their hands off the wheel for extended periods despite repeated warnings from the vehicle. But the crash underscored a vexing problem for automakers that want to gain an edge by launching technology that completely automates driving tasks. Unless a car is capable of driving itself safely in every situation, drivers will still have to remain alert and ready to take control even if the car is piloting itself.    The NTSB, the federal agency charged with investigating significant transportation accidents, said during a 37-minute section of the 41-minute Tesla trip, the driver kept his hands on the wheel for just 25 seconds, putting his hands on the wheel for one- to- three second increments after getting repeated visual and audible warnings.    General Motors Co (GM.N) delayed introduction of a driver assistance technology called Super Cruise that was initially planned for late last year because it said it was not ready. The technology will go on sale this fall.     Barry Walkup, chief engineer of Super Cruise, said the company added  a driver attention function, to insist on driver supervision.     The system uses a small camera that focuses on the driver and works with infrared lights to track head position to determine where the driver is looking.    If the system - which uses facial recognition software - detects the driver is not paying attention, it will prompt the driver to return attention to the road. If the driver does not respond, it will escalate alerts, including a steering wheel light bar, visual indicators, tactile alerts in the seat and audible alerts. If the driver does not respond, the vehicle is brought to a controlled stop. Volkswagen AG's (VOWG_p.DE) luxury Audi unit has a system that handles steering and braking at speeds of up to 40 miles. The system requires the driver to check in with the steering wheel every 15 seconds. Audi said the system will beep alerts at the driver, and if the driver does not respond, it will bring the vehicle to a stop. FILE PHOTO - New Autopilot features are demonstrated in a Tesla Model S during a Tesla event in Palo Alto, California October 14, 2015.Beck Diefenbach/File PhotoThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which is the lead agency for regulating self-driving cars, does not test or preapprove driver assistance systems before automakers install them. Instead, the agency responds to complaints or crashes when it investigates whether a potential defect poses an unreasonable risk to driver safety. The May 2016 Tesla accident has raised concerns about the regulation of self-driving cars. The NTSB will issue probable cause findings and may make recommendations to the NHTSA in the Tesla crash but does not plan to hold a public hearing on the incident, spokesman Keith Holloway said.      FILE PHOTO: A Tesla Model X is photographed alongside a Model S at a Tesla electric car dealership in Sydney, Australia, May 31, 2017.Jason Reed/File PhotoIn September 2016, Tesla unveiled new restrictions on Autopilot after widespread concerns the system lulled users into a false sense of security through its  hands-off  driving capability.    The updated system temporarily prevents drivers from using the system if they do not respond to audible warnings to take back control of the car. The car sounds warnings if drivers take their hands off the wheel for more than a minute at speeds above 45 miles per hour (72 kph) when there is no vehicle ahead, Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk told reporters in September. If the driver ignores three audible warnings in an hour, the system temporarily shuts off until it is parked. Musk said at the time that autopilot accidents are far more likely for expert users of the system, saying some users got as many as 10 warnings in an hour under the prior system. “It's not the neophytes, it's the experts. They get very comfortable with it and repeatedly ignore the car's warnings and in effect it becomes like a reflex action,” Musk said. Tesla monitors drivers through their interactions with the steering wheel, turn signal, and speed setting, NHTSA said in a separate report. Alphabet Inc's (GOOG.O) Waymo unit, which is also working on self-driving technology, is taking a different approach, arguing that asking drivers to pay attention while the car drives itself is wrong. Waymo is focusing its efforts on fully autonomous vehicles where humans take no part in driving, rather driver assistance.     We're not seeking to build a better car. Our goal is to build a better driver,  Waymo Chief Executive Officer John Krafcik said earlier this year.

The success of the bond, which is the second major Greek corporate issue this year, signals improving investor confidence after Greece concluded a bailout review and secured a 8.5-billion-euro loan last week, analysts said. The book building started on June 21 and closed on Friday. The yield was 3.10 percent, close to the low end of the 3.0 to 3.5 percent guidance range. National Bank and Eurobank were the lead managers.  After the completion of the second bailout review, Greek assets are derisking across the board,  Eurobank Equities analyst Nick Koskoletos said.  Mytilineos is capitalising on its fundamentals and export-oriented profile via its aluminium business to tap the market in what is the largest bond issue to be listed on the Athens bourse's fixed-income market,  he said. Expectations that Greece's economy will recover from the second half of the year and the absence of a planned corporate bond issue in the near future also helped, Beta Securities asset manager Konstantinos Boukas said. The yield on 10-year Greek government paper has declined after euro zone finance ministers approved the disbursement of new bailout money last week. It stood at 5.4 percent on Friday. Greece's last venture into international bond markets was with two issues in 2014. The government has said the country should be able to return to bond markets soon. Mytilineos is expected to incorporate its power plant construction, aluminium and electricity production units into the main group by the end of the month to simplify its structure and achieve cost savings.

A market heavyweight, e-commerce and Pay-TV group Naspers, led the bourse higher after posting a 41 percent profit jump. At 1500 GMT the rand was trading 0.5 percent firmer at 12.9200 per dollar, benefiting from a dip in the dollar following weak factory and services data that reignited doubts about U.S. economic growth for the rest of 2017.  The rand has firmed nearly 1.5 percent since South Africa's top court ruled on Thursday that secret ballots may be held for motions of no confidence in parliament, a potential threat to the tenure of the beleaguered president, Jacob Zuma. Data early in the week showing that inflation remained subdued and the current account deficit had grown slightly boosted sentiment, but that was reversed by a spat over the independence of the central bank, which dragged the rand to a three-week low.  Economists said consumer price, credit, employment and trade data due next week could further support optimistic views of the South African economy's ability to bounce back from recession. Bonds were firmer, with the yield on the benchmark paper due in 2026 down 3 basis points to 8.53 percent.  A strategist at Standard Bank Warrick Butler said he expected local paper, along with Turkish and Mexican bonds, to come back into favour  sooner rather than later, especially as U.S. Treasuries have not pushed higher despite some bullishness . On the equities market, the benchmark Top-40 index was up 0.92 percent at 45,358 points and the broader All-share index rose 0.84 percent to reach 51,503 points. Naspers, Africa's biggest listed company by market value, reported a 41 percent jump in annual profit as strong results from its Chinese money spinner Tencent offset weak performances from its pay-TV and other e-commerce ventures.  We were expecting an increase in earnings of 37 percent so they were slightly better than expected ... it's a major component of the All Share index so when it moves in a meaningful direction, then you see the rest of the market move as well,  said Independent Securities trader Ryan Woods.

{"news_time":"2017-06-23 12:35:00","news_title":"Breakingviews: Natural gas inflicts fresh wounds on old victim","keywords":"United States,Westinghouse,SOUTHERN CO,MISSISSIPPI/BREAKINGVIEWS,Americas,United States","sector":"","content":"DALLAS (Reuters Breakingviews) - Southern’s efforts to diversify fuel sources keep blowing up in its face. The $50 billion U.S. utility faces a big writedown risk after Mississippi regulators signaled the withdrawal of their support for its ambitious and expensive “clean-coal” power plant. It’s a fresh hit for a company struggling to complete a nuclear power plant following Westinghouse Electric’s bankruptcy. If the road to hell is paved with good intentions, then Southern executives’ feet must be getting hot. As part of its diversification drive, the company chose an innovative technology for its Kemper facility that converts coal into gas before burning it. But after seven years and some $7.5 billion, it’s still not working as intended. Mississippi regulators said on Wednesday they’d had enough. They want the company to find a way to use the plant without passing any more costs onto consumers through higher rates. That most likely means ditching the so-called clean-coal technology and relying on natural gas, which the completed portion of the plant has already been using for about three years. Such a move could force the company to take a $3.3 billion pre-tax writedown, according to Jefferies. NRG Energy also runs the only commercial-scale clean-coal facility in the country. But rather than start from scratch, it took proven technology that captures carbon dioxide emissions and slapped it onto a coal plant built in 1982. Southern’s penchant for innovation has now burned it twice. The company chose an untested design for its nuclear power plant at Vogtle, Georgia, but massive cost overruns there and at another utility's similar project in South Carolina forced contractor Westinghouse to file for Chapter 11 protection in March. Southern has guarantees from parent Toshiba, but the utility faces uncertain liabilities of its own and may have to pull the plug on the plant. Both facilities were commissioned in a vastly different energy climate years ago. Southern’s ambition of reducing its reliance on any single fuel source, and cleaning up the industry, seemed laudable at the time, but the abundance of cheap natural gas unleashed by hydraulic fracturing has undermined that strategy. There’s a risk that power companies will become overly dependent on gas. For now, though, shareholders are likely to welcome it if Southern stops trying to be the industry’s pioneer. On Twitter twitter.com/TheRealLSL Context News - On June 21, Mississippi regulators called on Southern Co to find a solution that would eliminate “ratepayer risk for unproven technology” on its Kemper facility, a plant that is trying to pioneer a new way to use clean coal. This result could include changing the plant so it operates only on natural gas. The plant, which has taken seven years to finish and cost $7.5 billion, has been running primarily on natural gas for about three years. - For previous columns by the author, Reuters customers can click on - SIGN UP FOR BREAKINGVIEWS EMAIL ALERTS bit.ly/BVsubscribe The author is a Reuters  columnist.

Sometimes it is verbal abuse hurled at her, other times he punches her in her arms and neck when he gets back to their small rented house in a poor southern neighborhood of the Colombian capital Bogota.  Anything can spark his violent rage. He's very jealous,  said Diana, 29, who did not want to give her full name.  Sometimes he accuses me of flirting, other times of speaking too long on the phone or going out with my friends.  Colombia's half-century of war is coming to an end, and   rebels from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) are expected to hand over the last of their weapons on Friday as part of a peace accord signed last year with the government. But for Diana, and tens of thousands of women across Colombia, a daily war continues at home, regardless of any peace deal. Women in the South American nation of 48 million people are more likely to experience violence in their homes than on the street and their attackers are often people they know. The biggest threat of physical or sexual violence to women and girls comes from former or current boyfriends, husbands, stepfathers or relatives, making home the most dangerous place for women in Colombia. In 2015, nearly 41,000 women reported suffering abuse at the hands of their partners, with 80 percent of attacks occurring inside the home, according to Colombia's National Institute of Legal Medicine and Forensic Sciences.    A very high percentage of violence against women happens outside of the conflict and specifically in the domestic space,  Belen Sanz, head of U.N. Women in Colombia, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Femicides One woman is killed every four days in Colombia. Many are victims of femicide - a killing of a woman by a man because of her gender -  often at the hands of a former or current partner. One of the most recent victims was 34-year-old Elcy Yamile Olaya, stabbed to death by her boyfriend in her home one evening in April. Tackling violence against women is a key challenge for Colombia as the nation puts behind it 52 years of war that has killed 200,000 people and displaced 7 million. For Diana, true peace would be feeling safe in her home and earning enough money to put her children through school.  Peace for me would be knowing that I didn't have to rely on him for money, that I could afford to leave him and rent a place of my own. I've nowhere else to go,  said Diana, who works as a part-time manicurist. For Colombian girls, sexual abuse, including rape, in the home is often the greatest threat they face, with stepfathers and relatives the main culprits. The man sexually abusing a girl may be the family's sole breadwinner, who threatens to remove his financial support if the girl reports the crime.  It's abhorrent. There's an enormous under-reporting of cases of sexual violence,  said Cristina Velez, head of gender affairs at the Bogota mayor's office.  We're constantly encouraging women to report crimes of gender violence so that we can provide support and refuge and so that women don't feel they are alone,  she said.  But it's difficult for women to have faith in and trust the justice system.  Social Tolerance Across Latin America, women's rights have advanced in recent decades and Colombian women are now better educated, and more of them have entered the workforce, universities and politics. New laws with tougher punishments for gender crimes have been passed, including a 2015 law against femicide and a law against acid attacks last year. But experts say tolerance of gender violence in Colombia's macho culture means women are often blamed for the violence inflicted on them.   There's a very high tolerance of violence against women in Colombia and that tolerance is reflected in different spaces .. in the private sphere, there's silence about that,  Sanz said.  But also it happens in the public sphere which is extremely concerning because we have leaders in politics sometimes tolerating and even justifying violence against women.  Just last week, elected local councilor Ramon Cardona said in a meeting,  laws are like women, they exist to be violated.  A government poll in 2014 showed nearly two in five people surveyed thought the way a woman dressed exposed them to being raped. It also found 13 percent of Colombian women and 22 percent of men surveyed said a woman who stays with an abusive partner does so because she enjoys being beaten. In response, Velez said Bogota's administration is focused on getting men to confront traditional roles and question what masculinity means, a way to changing their behavior and curbing the abuse of women. About 500 men, including bus drivers, have participated in  masculinity workshops  in the past year.  Ultimately, there has to be a cultural and social transformation towards violence against women,  Velez said.  I think attitudes are changing. There's now more public outrage over cases of gender violence.  Velez said the FARC peace deal is an opportunity for the government to focus more attention and resources on combating gender violence, and for the problem to become more visible.   Gender violence has been a hidden issue and one that took second place,  she said.  The end of the conflict with the FARC has uncovered an issue that we didn't see. It's like opening up a Pandora's box revealing the violence against women and girls.

With 2.6 million people across Kenya short of food due to consecutive failed rains, aid agencies have been slaughtering herders' weakened livestock in northern Kenya and distributing the meat to hungry families.  Their skins could actually have been part of large tanneries,  said Sid Chatterjee, the United Nations resident coordinator in Kenya, describing a small tannery he visited in northern Turkana County, which has been hard-hit by drought. He saw goat skins processed into world-class soft leather, increasing their value ten-fold.  If I had gone and bought that same purse in a Gucci store in Rome, I would probably have not known (it was from Turkana), such was the quality,  he said.  I can see the huge potential of Kenya.  Chatterjee was speaking at a forum on resilience to discuss ways of ending the region's food crises. A record-breaking 26.5 million people are going hungry across the Horn of Africa due to poor rains and conflict, with many on the move in search of grazing, water and work. The long-awaited spring rains were delayed and erratic, with parts of Kenya receiving less than 40 percent of normal rainfall, the country's meteorological department said.   Five major droughts have hit Kenya since 2006, said the Kenya Red Cross Society's (KRCS) operations manager James Mwangi, with 2 to 4 million people needing emergency aid each time.  For me as a humanitarian worker, it becomes increasingly disturbing to go back to the same households to deliver food assistance or other forms of assistance every time,  he said. With droughts every two years, families do not have time to rebuild the assets, like livestock and savings, needed to see them through emergencies, he said. KRCS has set up more than 20 resilience projects in the wake of a devastating 2011 drought, largely focused on using drip irrigation to grow grass for livestock and food for people in lands where rain failures regularly decimate nomads' herds.  We can't just remain relief based organizations,  said KRCS's general secretary Abbas Gullet.  We want to address the root causes of these humanitarian crises.  KRCS has dug boreholes to create dams, lined with tarpaulin to prevent evaporation and seepage, which have produced food during the current drought.  In the middle of nowhere, people are farming,  Gullet said, describing fields of watermelon, onions and kale. If such projects are scaled up, they could have a massive impact, experts said, pointing to the success of the agricultural Green Revolution in boosting harvests in India.  We need to be investing in prevention,  said Mamadou Biteye, the Rockefeller Foundation's Africa managing director, adding every dollar spent on resilience saves $4.5 that would have been spent on disaster response. In Turkana, underground lakes the size of the U.S. state of Delaware were discovered in 2013 but excitement waned when it was found the water was too salty to use without desalination.   The opportunity is there,  said Chatterjee, calling for greater government and private sector investment in Kenya's drought-stricken northern counties.  By focusing our action on a few counties...getting the resilience model going, we'll be able to change the game.

KRCS has set up more than 20 resilience projects in the wake of a devastating 2011 drought, largely focused on using drip irrigation to grow grass for livestock and food for people in lands where rain failures regularly decimate nomads' herds.  We can't just remain relief based organizations,  said KRCS's general secretary Abbas Gullet.  We want to address the root causes of these humanitarian crises.  KRCS has dug boreholes to create dams, lined with tarpaulin to prevent evaporation and seepage, which have produced food during the current drought.  In the middle of nowhere, people are farming,  Gullet said, describing fields of watermelon, onions and kale. If such projects are scaled up, they could have a massive impact, experts said, pointing to the success of the agricultural Green Revolution in boosting harvests in India.  We need to be investing in prevention,  said Mamadou Biteye, the Rockefeller Foundation's Africa managing director, adding every dollar spent on resilience saves $4.5 that would have been spent on disaster response. In Turkana, underground lakes the size of the U.S. state of Delaware were discovered in 2013 but excitement waned when it was found the water was too salty to use without desalination.   The opportunity is there,  said Chatterjee, calling for greater government and private sector investment in Kenya's drought-stricken northern counties.  By focusing our action on a few counties...getting the resilience model going, we'll be able to change the game.

Britain's FTSE 100 was down 0.2 percent at its close, weighed down by weakness in health care and mining stocks - large-cap dollar earners. Friday marked the one-year anniversary of Britons voting in a referendum by a narrow margin to quit the EU, a shock outcome which then sent sterling, British and European stocks into a tailspin. While stocks have recovered sharply from their slump in the immediate aftermath, in U.S. dollar terms, British stocks continue to lag peers in Europe and elsewhere as a cloudy outlook for sterling dented appetite among foreign investors.  Brexit itself, I don't think, has had much of an effect on the market, but what has had an effect has been the fall in sterling,  said Paul Mumford, senior investment manager at Cavendish Asset Management. Mumford said the inconclusive outcome of this month's national election in Britain was also now weighing on sterling.  Because of the uncertainty that might have arisen from the election result, it may be that sterling is going to stay down longer than we thought,  Mumford said. The pan-European STOXX 600 index was down 0.2 percent as falls among financials, pharma firms and energy shares weighed. Elsewhere, broker changes helped drive price action, with British broadcaster ITV rising more than 3 percent after Morgan Stanley upgraded it to  buy , citing its attractive valuation.  Timing is always tricky but typically the right moment to buy TV stocks is when advertising starts to improve, even if this is just on a second derivative basis (i.e. it starts to become less bad),  Morgan Stanley analysts said in a note. Shares in pizza delivery firm Domino's Pizza were among the biggest fallers, down 2.8 percent near a two-year low after a downgrade from Berenberg. Berenberg analysts said Domino's faced potential issues ahead, including falling behind in terms of technology as well as food inflation putting pressure on franchisee margins. Insurer NN Group was the biggest faller, down nearly 4 percent after Dutch watchdog KiFid said that the firm must compensate one its clients in a mis-selling case.

Verstappen topped first practice with a time of 1:44.410, with team mate Daniel Ricciardo finishing four tenths behind him to ensure a Red Bull one-two, before the Dutch teenager capped an excellent day with an improved time of 1:43.362 in the second session.  The only disappointment for the pacesetter came when he appeared to lose control late on before spinning sideways into the advertising hoardings.  It was very weird,  Verstappen told Sky Sports.  I locked up and was still trying to make the corner, but I tried to play it safe and take the exit road.   Suddenly I lost the rear and then I just had a four-wheel power slide into the barrier.  It was a scrappy day punctuated by several misjudgments on the scorching Baku circuit. Force India's Sergio Perez had been flying through the city circuit and registered the fourth best time in the first session before crashing late on.  He escaped unscathed after colliding with the external wall at a narrow section at Turn Eight, and although his car lost its rear right wheel, Force India mechanics succeeded in repairing it for Perez to finish seventh in P2.

The greenback was also broadly weaker versus commodity-linked currencies, which got a boost as global benchmark Brent futures recovered from a seven-month low.      Sterling rose for a third consecutive day following a speech by soon-to-depart Bank of England policymaker Kristin Forbes, who late Thursday urged hiking U.K. rates immediately to stem a weaker pound.     Trading volume was muted in the absence of major economic data, according to traders and analysts.      This has been largely a week of consolidation among major currency pairings given the lack of economic data this week,  said Omer Esiner, chief market strategist at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington.     The dollar index, which tracks the dollar against six major peers, fell 0.37 percent at 97.232, retreating further from a one-month peak reached on Tuesday.      The euro was up 0.45 percent at $1.1200, while the greenback slipped to 111.22 yen.     The pound gained 0.4 percent at $1.2728.      The greenback rose earlier this week on comments from New York Fed President William Dudley, who said a tightening labor market would push up wages and cause U.S. inflation to reverse from its current pullback.     The U.S. Consumer Price Index has come in weaker-than-expected for three consecutive months. This raised concerns whether inflation would reach the Fed's 2 percent goal.     Traders, however, were doubtful about this premise, which would support the case for another rate increase later this year as recent U.S. data on balance have fallen short of forecast.     On Friday, Markit's flash June reports on U.S. factory and services activity was weaker than expected, while the government said new home sales rebounded more than expected in May.       The data need to confirm the Fed's stance for another rate hike this year,  Esiner said.     The futures market implied traders saw a 53 percent chance the Fed would raise rates in December, CME Group's FedWatch program showed.     Meanwhile, commodity-linked currencies rose with a rebound in crude oil prices. Brent crude futures were up 0.9 percent at $45.62 a barrel after hitting their lowest since November on Thursday.     The Australian dollar was up 0.5 percent at $0.7578, while the New Zealand dollar was up 0.4 percent at $0.7291.  ========================================================     Currency bid prices at 12:00PM (1600 GMT)  Description      RIC      Last       U.S. Close  Pct     YTD Pct                                        Previous   Change   Change                                        Session              Euro/Dollar      EUR=     $1.1196    $1.1150     +0.41%  +6.50%  Dollar/Yen       JPY=     111.2700   111.3200    -0.04%  -4.79%  Euro/Yen         EURJPY=  124.58     124.12      +0.37%  +1.17%  Dollar/Swiss     CHF=     0.9691     0.9718      -0.28%  -4.78%  Sterling/Dollar  GBP=     1.2724     1.2681      +0.34%  +3.15%  Dollar/Canadian  CAD=     1.3262     1.3232      +0.23%  -1.25%  Australian/Doll  AUD=     0.7575     0.7541      +0.45%  +4.99%  ar                                                         Euro/Swiss       EURCHF=  1.0850     1.0836      +0.13%  +1.24%  Euro/Sterling    EURGBP=  0.8796     0.8791      +0.06%  +3.26%  NZ               NZD=     0.7292     0.7263      +0.40%  +5.06%  Dollar/Dollar                                              Dollar/Norway    NOK=     8.4469     8.4885      -0.49%  -2.20%  Euro/Norway      EURNOK=  9.4605     9.4677      -0.08%  +4.12%  Dollar/Sweden    SEK=     8.7130     8.7482      +0.01%  -4.33%  Euro/Sweden      EURSEK=  9.7570     9.7562      +0.01%  +1.85%             (Additonal reporting by Jemima Kelly in Paris and Shinichi Saoshiro in Tokyo; Editing by John Stonestreet and Dan Grebler)       ","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/global-forex-idUSL8N1JK2PF"},

Macron, in power for little more than a month, has vowed to protect French workers from what he sees as  social dumping , in which companies employ cheaper labor, and unfair competition from the poorer eastern European states. Poland, Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic say they should be allowed to compete on lower prices - just as more developed western EU nations compete on quality products and know-how - to catch up after decades of communist stagnation. Along with looming negotiations on the EU's next multi-year joint budget that runs from 2021, this dispute is shaping up as one of the most contentious issues facing the bloc, exacerbating an east-west rift as it seeks unity to tackle Brexit. But meeting on the sidelines of an EU summit, Macron and the leaders of the east European states - known together as the Visegrad four - agreed to set up an expert-level group to try to narrow differences over rules for so-called  posted workers .  At the Visegrad meeting this morning we established which issues we disagree on and where we will continue to talk to better understand each other's constraints,  Macron told a joint news conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Friday.  There are issues where I'd like to advance together, the posted workers directive being one... I believe we need a profound reform of the balance. I will do it with respect for our partners.  EU states are divided on rules under which, say, a Bulgarian truck driver or a Lithuanian bricklayer can work in France for a limited time for the eastern European wage, usually below the minimum level guaranteed in the west.  I pointed out to Emmanuel Macron today how low wages are in the Czech Republic compared to France, and that French firms can also do more to raise (their) wages,  Czech Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka said.   We will start with the directive on posted workers.  A diplomatic source said the five leaders had agreed to meet again in September. East-West The Visegrad four have also clashed with France on the treatment of refugees and migrants from outside the EU, and were infuriated by Macron's open criticism of the track record of Warsaw and Budapest on democracy and rule of law. But Macron received strong support from Merkel, Europe's most powerful leader, who said on Friday she believed they were obliged to speak out when common EU values were being damaged. Macron has previously said he would seek sanctions on Poland, whose nationalist-minded government has angered the EU with moves to impose stricter state control over judges and public media and with its refusal to take in any refugees. Earlier this week Macron told the Visegrad four not to treat the EU as a  supermarket  and said they would face consequences if they failed to respect EU rules and values.  He drew scorn from Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who put Macron's comments down to his relative youth. The French leader is 39. On Friday Orban struck a more conciliatory note.  As far as I can see, we identified the issues where pragmatic cooperation and agreement can be achieved on the basis of mutual respect,  he told reporters.

The findings, released in a statement a day before the company's annual shareholder meeting, may quell some of the investor disquiet that has buffeted Infosys in recent months.  Infosys commissioned law firm Gibson Dunn and consultancy Control Risks to look into allegations that a whistleblower made against the company in February. Those accusations included improprieties in the acquisitions of Panaya, a New Jersey-based automation technology provider, and Silicon Valley start-up Skava, as well as inappropriate compensation paid to Infosys Chief Executive Vishal Sikka. The whistleblower also accused Sikka of requesting that improper deals be made with customers, while saying that the company's mergers and acquisitions team acted without proper approvals. A letter from Gibson Dunn to the Infosys audit committee -- published along with the company statement -- said that the investigation found  no evidence whatsoever  of wrongdoing by Infosys, its directors or its employees. Besides the whistleblower allegations, Infosys has also been rocked by accusations by some of its founders of lapses in corporate governance. In early February TV channels reported that the company's founder promoters, led by its first chairman N.R. Narayana Murthy, wrote to the board to express concerns about executive pay rises and severance deals given to two former executives. Murthy didn't answer a call seeking comment on the Gibson Dunn report that also said it  found no evidence that the CEO received excessive variable compensation or incurred unreasonable expenses .  The internal inquiry also reviewed the results of an earlier investigation by Indian law firm Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas (CAM) on the departure of its CFO and on the veracity of its findings.  We also concluded that CAM's two previous investigations were thorough and that their findings and conclusions were reasonable and credible based on the evidence,  the Gibson Dunn letter said. Shares in Infosys have also come under pressure from political rhetoric in the United States about the outsourcing of U.S. jobs and a proposed tightening of visa regulations in a country on which the company and its rivals rely heavily. In a separate statement on Friday, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said that Infosys had paid a $1 million settlement for failing to adequately compensate hundreds of workers, failing to pay applicable taxes and breaking U.S visa rules. The settlement resolved whistleblower claims that Infosys, in the course of providing services, routinely brought foreign IT personnel into New York to perform work in violation of the terms of their visas.

Leaders of the G20 leading economies will hold a July 7-8 summit in Germany's second-largest city posing a challenge for the 20,000 police officers who will secure the event. Their task will be compounded by a planned demonstration against Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan by supporters of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), the official added. Turkish nationalists who support Erdogan are also expected to hold a rival demonstration in support of the Turkish leader, raising the prospect of violence, the official said. Police expect some 3,000 pro-PKK activists and rival Erdogan supporters to show up in the city. The Higher Administrative Court of Hamburg on Friday banned a camp that anti-capitalist protesters had planned to set up in a park in the city, using up to 3,000 tents and offering beds and food to demonstrators. The court ruled in favor of the City of Hamburg and police, who had rejected a request to set up the protest camp from June 30 until July 9. Police will also have to secure the summit against a possible attack by Islamist militants. U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are expected to attend the talks.

Foreign investors could tell them.      While the main FTSE 100 index .FTSE has risen 17 percent over the 12 months since Britain voted to leave the European Union, this has been driven almost exclusively by a fall in sterling. In dollar terms, British stocks have underperformed every developed index in the world.   Even at the level of British equity sectors, the picture is similar: companies earning sterling - down 14.3 percent against the dollar GBP=D3 and 13.2 percent against the euro since the June 23, 2016 vote - have underperformed dollar earners. The worst performers are telecoms .MIGB0TC00PGB and utilities <.MIGB0UT00PGB >, both focused on the British economy. Top of the pile are materials companies .MIGB0MT00PGB, which include dollar-earning miners. They have outperformed the MSCI UK index .MIGB00000PUS. Data from Bats Europe, a stock exchange and index provider, shows that FTSE-listed companies that generate a large portion of their revenues from the UK are actually flat, whereas those with a high percentage of revenues from abroad are up 26 percent.      Keeping Safe Another clear winner has been British government debt, a low-risk investment sought in uncertain times.   The yield on 10-year gilts, which moves inversely to price, has dropped by a quarter over the past year while German and U.S. equivalents have risen. GB10YT=RR DE10YT=RR US10YT=RR  Gilts will outperform as growth will ultimately disappoint and increase the risk of a harder Brexit outcome,  said Morgan Stanley market strategist Andrew Sheets. In dollar terms, the 4.2 percent returns on gilts is still better than those on both U.S. Treasuries and German Bunds. Brexit negotiations began this week, against the backdrop of political uncertainty, with British Prime Minister Theresa May trying to forge a deal with a small Northern Ireland party to prop up her minority government after the June 8 snap election delivered a hung parliament.  The picture is further clouded by an apparent split in opinion at the Bank of England on the future path for rates.  Three British rate-setters said earlier this month that rates should start to rise for the first time in a decade, but BoE Governor Mark Carney doused speculation this week that he might soon back this view.

The findings, released in a statement a day before the company's annual shareholder meeting, may quell some of the investor disquiet that has buffeted Infosys in recent months.  Infosys commissioned law firm Gibson Dunn and consultancy Control Risks to look into allegations that a whistleblower made against the company in February. Those accusations included improprieties in the acquisitions of Panaya, a New Jersey-based automation technology provider, and Silicon Valley start-up Skava, as well as inappropriate compensation paid to Infosys Chief Executive Vishal Sikka. The whistleblower also accused Sikka of requesting that improper deals be made with customers, while saying that the company's mergers and acquisitions team acted without proper approvals. A letter from Gibson Dunn to the Infosys audit committee -- published along with the company statement -- said that the investigation found  no evidence whatsoever  of wrongdoing by Infosys, its directors or its employees. Besides the whistleblower allegations, Infosys has also been rocked by accusations by some of its founders of lapses in corporate governance. In early February TV channels reported that the company's founder promoters, led by its first chairman N.R. Narayana Murthy, wrote to the board to express concerns about executive pay rises and severance deals given to two former executives. Murthy didn't answer a call seeking comment on the Gibson Dunn report that also said it  found no evidence that the CEO received excessive variable compensation or incurred unreasonable expenses .  The internal inquiry also reviewed the results of an earlier investigation by Indian law firm Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas (CAM) on the departure of its CFO and on the veracity of its findings.  We also concluded that CAM's two previous investigations were thorough and that their findings and conclusions were reasonable and credible based on the evidence,  the Gibson Dunn letter said. Shares in Infosys have also come under pressure from political rhetoric in the United States about the outsourcing of U.S. jobs and a proposed tightening of visa regulations in a country on which the company and its rivals rely heavily. In a separate statement on Friday, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said that Infosys had paid a $1 million settlement for failing to adequately compensate hundreds of workers, failing to pay applicable taxes and breaking U.S visa rules. The settlement resolved whistleblower claims that Infosys, in the course of providing services, routinely brought foreign IT personnel into New York to perform work in violation of the terms of their visas. Since the beginning of 2017, shares in Infosys have fallen by 6.7 percent while the Nifty IT Index has dropped 2.2 percent.

In an unexpectedly divided decision, Banco de México raised its benchmark rate by a notch to 7 percent, as forecast by all 17 analysts surveyed by Reuters last week. One member voted to hold rates.     In its policy statement, the bank said  the reference rate has reached a level that is consistent with the process of efficient convergence of inflation to the 3 percent target,  hinting that further increases are no longer necessary.      Now the debate on the timing of potential rate cuts is set to heat up,  economists at Morgan Stanley wrote in a report.      We still see talk of policy easing as premature. While there is merit in arguments that real rates may be already quite high, Mexico is still not out of the inflation woods.      Rate-future prices indicated a nearly 100 percent probability that the central bank will keep its reference rate at 7 percent in its August meeting, with a cut coming only in December.     Despite fading expectations of further policy tightening, the Mexican peso strengthened 0.9 percent, tracking an increase in crude prices. Oil-heavy Colombia's peso firmed 0.6 percent.     The Brazilian real and the country's benchmark Bovespa stock index seesawed as lingering political concerns kept up volatility.      Shares of power utility Centrais Elétricas Brasileiras SA  were the biggest decliners on the index as traders booked gains from a 6.4 percent rally on Thursday triggered by optimism over its restructuring plans.     Meatpackers JBS SA and Marfrig also fell after the United States decided late on Thursday to suspend imports of Brazilian fresh beef for sanitary concerns. Shares of rival Minerva SA, which will export to the United States from Uruguay instead of Brazil, rose 0.7 percent.

The blue chip FTSE 100 index was down 0.2 percent at 7,424.13 points at its close, while mid caps were up 0.1 percent. UK shares were hit hard in the immediate aftermath of last June's Brexit vote, but recovered speedily as a fall in sterling boosted firms that earn revenue in foreign currencies. While the FTSE ended 2016 up more than 14 percent, fresh political concerns stemming from a hung parliament in this month's election and uncertainty around Brexit negotiations have put the brakes on UK shares this year. Despite hitting a series of record highs along the way, British blue chips are up just 4 percent year to date with the FTSE the weakest major European market in terms of performance. The pan-European STOXX 600 has gained more than 7 percent.  The market tries to run higher looking at the benefits from the weaker pound, but then is struck back by the reality of the fact that this is an inherently unsustainable situation,  Ken Odeluga, market analyst at City Index, said. Though sectors such as housebuilders, which were hit hard, have largely bounced back, with Persimmon and Bellway making headway this year, investors remain concerned about firms exposed to the British economy, such as retailers. A depressed sterling has increased concerns around a rise in inflation, which has hit shares in British retail stocks which could come under pressure as consumers' pockets are squeezed.  We expect subpar growth as Brexit bites. We see greater political instability, including a risk of early elections and a new government, but also a softer Brexit and easier policy,  Morgan Stanley's economy and strategy team said in a note. The picture is lacklustre in dollar terms especially, with both the FTSE 100 and mid caps roughly flat since the Brexit vote. Firms in internationally exposed sectors such as miners, tobacco companies and consumer goods have been clear winners, though renewed weakness in the price of oil has dogged the FTSE 100's energy constituents. On Friday, dollar earners were the biggest fallers, with health stocks AstraZeneca and Shire, as well as Smurfit Kappa and Diageo all down between 1.3 and 2.5 percent.

Ford announced on Tuesday it would move some production of its Focus small car to China instead of Mexico, a step that follows the U.S. automaker's January cancellation of a planned $1.8 billion plant in the central state of San Luis Potosi. The scrapping of the Ford plant was a bitter blow, coming after U.S. President Donald Trump had blamed the country for hollowing out U.S manufacturing on the campaign trail, and threatened to impose hefty tariffs on cars made in Mexico. Since then, rhetoric from the Trump administration has become more conciliatory, and Mexico and the United States have expressed confidence that the renegotiation of the NAFTA trade deal, expected to begin in August, could benefit both nations. But the loss of the Focus business is an unwelcome reminder of competition Mexico faces from Asia at a time China's auto exports and the quality of its cars are rising.  For a long time, the quality of vehicles coming out of China was not to global standards. There was a gap in quality that (favored) Mexico - but that is closing,  said Philippe Houchois, an analyst covering the auto industry at investment bank Jefferies.  That is probably a threat to Mexico.  In the past decade, global automakers have invested heavily in Chinese factories to make them capable of building cars at quality levels that make the grade in developed markets. Ford's decision to shift Focus production for the United States market to China from Mexico shows automakers have increasing flexibility to choose between the two countries to supply niche vehicles to American consumers or other markets. 'Very Troubling' Demand for small cars in the United States is waning and General Motors Co (GM.N) faces a similar situation to Ford's with its Chevrolet Cruze compact. Were GM to go down the same path with the Cruze and shift its production out of U.S. factories, it could give more work to its Mexican plants - but might also bring its Chinese operations in Shenyang or Yantai into play.  The Cruze is a global product that is built in multiple GM plants around the world, including the U.S.,  said GM spokesman Pat Morrissey.  Our general philosophy is that we like to build where we sell.  Studies show Mexican manufacturing is competitive, and business leaders believe that NAFTA talks between Mexico, the United States and Canada could ultimately yield tougher regional content rules for the region that benefit local investment. Ford said its decision balanced cheaper Chinese labor rates against pricier shipping, but that in the end an already-planned refit of its Chinese factory saved it some $500 million over retooling both that facility and its Hermosillo plant in Mexico. The volatile state of U.S.-Mexican trade relations also carries big risks if Trump renews his threats to impose 35-percent tariffs on cars made in Mexico. To be sure, Trump has also threatened to levy 45-percent tariffs on Chinese goods and his Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said he found Ford's China move  very troubling.  Trump's threats have battered the peso, ironically making Mexico's goods cheaper. Uncertainty over the future of NAFTA pushed the currency to a record low in January, although it has since rebounded. That same month, the Boston Consulting Group published an assessment of manufacturing competitiveness that gave Mexico an 11-percent lead over China.  That advantage has prompted global firms to plow billions of dollars into the Mexican auto industry, pushing output to record highs. Some officials in the automotive sector painted Ford's move as a one-off decision.  There's still very dynamic investment and growth in plants,  said Alfredo Arzola, director of the automotive cluster in Guanajuato state, one of Mexico's top carmaking hubs. Still, there have been  significant quality improvements  in Chinese cars, consultancy J.D. Power said in a 2016 study. Chinese car manufacturing could catch up with international standards in China by 2018 or 2019, said Jacob George, general manager of J.D. Power's Asia Pacific Operations, citing the consultancy's gauge of  hard quality , or failures.  However, when measured in terms of  perceptual  quality, China was probably still some 4 to 6 years behind, he added.

One of the big three ratings firms, Moody's, is set to publish its review for its Aa2 rating with a stable outlook after European markets close. Macron has pledged to tackle unemployment, seen as one of the main hurdles for France's ailing economy. Through various labour reforms he aims to cut the jobless rate to levels not seen for more than two decades by the end of his term. Moody's said on Monday that the parliamentary majority won on Sunday for Macron's 'En Marche!' eased that path to reform, which is credit positive for the rating.  In France, a positive rating change by Moody's would be premature, but a move (on the) ... outlook seems possible given the better GDP growth outlook and subsiding political risks,  Commerzbank rates strategist Christoph Rieger said. France's 10-year bond yield was flat on the day at 0.6 percent on Friday, near a seven-month low of 0.578 percent hit nine days ago. At about 34 basis points, the gap to the benchmark German equivalent was around the lowest since November. Other euro zone bond yields were little changed on the day. Ratings agency S&P;'s chief economist said this month that it is likely to raise its 1.5 percent growth forecast for France. S&P; is not scheduled to review its AA (stable) rating for France until October, but Fitch - which also welcomed Macron's parliamentary majority this week - will reassess its rating at the end of next month.  (Macron's) labour reforms are going to be a key determinant of whether we see upward pressure ... in terms of France's rating,  Rabobank strategist Richard McGuire said.  There is certainly a lot of positive sentiment. That is all hope rather that reality and I suspect (ratings) agencies would want to see some of that reality before they make a move.  Moody's is also due to review its Aaa rating for Germany and its Caa3 rating for Greece on Friday. DZ Bank analysts are calling for an upgrade to Caa2 for Greece after the country secured a debt deal with creditors this month.

In the first test of her negotiating strength after losing a parliamentary majority at a June 8 election she did not need to call, May responded to criticism by other EU leaders at a summit of the offer, which one described as  inadequate . The 60-year-old leader, who was once in control of immigration when she was Britain's interior minister, said her aim was to make sure those people from EU countries who had made their homes in her country could stay. She added she would spell out the details of her plan on Monday.  I remain of the view that this is a fair and serious offer and let's be clear about what we're saying: those citizens from EU countries that have come to the United Kingdom and made their lives and homes in the United Kingdom will be able to stay and we will guarantee their rights in the United Kingdom,  she told a news conference at the summit in Brussels.  I think that's a very serious offer. There are some differences between that and the proposals of the European Commission but the matter will now go into the negotiations.  European Council President Donald Tusk said his first impression of the offer was that it fell short of expectations, while others said they would have to look at the details before determining whether the proposal reduced EU citizens' rights. The size of the gap between the British and EU positions on what had been viewed as one of the less problematic areas of contention underlines how complicated the negotiations to unravel more than 40 years of union will be. But May suggested differences were to be expected in the early days of the talks, which will run until March 2019. British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the EU summit in Brussels, Belgium, June 22, 2017.Gonzalo Fuentes We've had a good constructive start and want to continue the negotiations exactly in that way and that is what we will be doing,  she said. Recriminations at Home Several EU officials suggested that May's weakness after her failed gamble in calling the election could boost their chances of forcing more compromise from the British team, a lack of strength only highlighted by recriminations at home. Her former colleague, finance minister-turned-newspaper editor George Osborne, embarrassed the prime minister when an editorial in his newspaper reported that May had thwarted attempts by her predecessor to give EU citizens living in Britain unilateral guarantees.  David Cameron wanted to reassure EU citizens they would be allowed to stay. All his cabinet agreed with that unilateral offer, except his Home Secretary, Mrs May, who insisted on blocking it,  the Evening Standard reported. May struck back, saying:  That's certainly not my recollection , but with Conservative lawmakers blaming her personally for leading them into an election in which they lost  seats, her position is perilous.  Lawmakers say she will stay on for now, and May's aides were clear that the message she brought to Brussels was that she planned to lead Britain during the Brexit negotiations.  As I have made clear to my European colleagues, if you look  at what happened in the general election, over 80 percent of voters voted for parties who were committed to the United Kingdom leaving the European Union  she said.  And that is exactly what we are going to do.  Editing by Andrew Roche","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-may-idUSKBN19E1RE"},

The country's largest non-state gas producer is expected to start exporting LNG from the first phase of the Yamal project, situated far above the Arctic circle, towards the end of this year and may bring forward its final stage by six months, CFO Mark Gyetvay said. But it is the inception of Novatek's second, and Russia's third, large-scale LNG project called Arctic LNG 2 that would transform the company, headed by Russia's richest businessman Leonid Mikhelson, into a top global producer within a decade.  We have huge ambitions to be just as large as Qatar is as one country, but as one company,  Gyetvay said in London on the sidelines of an energy forum. Qatar and Russia have long been rivals in global gas markets. Qatar's supplies came under the spotlight in the past month after Saudi Arabia cut economic and diplomatic ties, in a move ratcheting up a wider violent and diplomatic conflict in the Middle East. Russia's energy industry, meanwhile, has been hamstrung by European and U.S. sanctions over its annexation of Ukraine's Crimean peninsula, with Europeans particularly sensitive to any potential Russian gas supply cuts in retaliation for political tensions in the region. Second Phase In terms of LNG, Qatar is by far the largest exporter, selling 77.2 million tonnes of the liquefied gas and accounting for just under 30 percent of market share in 2016, according to energy research group IHS and the International Gas Union. Russia that year was seventh with exports of 10.8 million tonnes and a 4 percent market share. The Yamal project, once all stages are complete, will export an additional 16.5 million tonnes, which would put Russia, already the world's largest crude oil exporter, in third place just below Australia. Of progress on Yamal, Gyetvay said the second phase would be ready in the second half of next year while the third could be completed by the first half of 2019, rather than the second, as all facilities were expected to be delivered this year.  If we do Arctic LNG 2 - we'll start the process of construction in 2019 if we make that FID (final investment decision) - the plan is to make sure we have the first LNG in the market by 2023,  he said. Mikhelson said on March 29 production from the two projects on the Yamal and neighbouring Gydan peninsula could produce more than 70 million tonnes annually - within spitting distance of Qatar's exports. And President Vladimir Putin told Mikhelson a day later Russia not only could but would become the largest LNG exporter should the pace of development continue. Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih expressed the Kingdom's interest in participating in the Arctic LNG 2 project earlier this month although Gyetvay said it was too early to comment on any future foreign investors. Qatar already has a large investment in Russia's energy industry in the form of the 19.5 percent stake in Russia's largest oil company, Rosneft, that it bought last year with trading group Glencore. Western sanctions on Russian companies including Novatek  obviously had an effect  on the Yamal project, Gyetvay said:  We had to revert to the use of Russian and Chinese finance . But for now, he does not see further impact even as Washington tightened those sanctions because they concern financing rather than technology, which Novatek is free to purchase from anywhere as it needs for its projects.

While both May's Conservatives and the opposition Labour Party now explicitly support leaving the club the United Kingdom joined in 1973, some of the Union's most powerful politicians have raised the possibility of Britain cancelling Brexit. Will Brexit actually happen? And if it does, how might it look? Following are some of the options. 1) Brexit in Name Only Under this scenario, Britain leaves the EU but gets a deal that is as close as possible to EU membership. Before the June 8 election, May proposed a clean break from the EU: leaving its single market, which enshrines free movement of people, goods, services and capital, and proposing limits on immigration and a bespoke customs deal with the EU. But the election result deprived her Conservative Party of its majority in parliament, and such is the collapse of May's authority that her Brexit strategy is being picked apart - and softened - in public by her ministers, lawmakers and allies.   When the British people voted (in the EU referendum) last June, they did not vote to become poorer, or less secure,  British finance minister Philip Hammond said in a speech this month.  They did vote to leave the EU. And we will leave the EU. But it must be done in a way that works for Britain,  Hammond said, adding that he wanted an agreement for trade in goods and services and a transition deal to avoid unnecessary disruption. The Brexit referendum result, under this scenario, would be formally honored but Britain would remain either in - or very close - to the single market and the customs union and with some deal on immigration, while paying membership dues to the EU. London Mayor Sadiq Khan has called for continued membership of the single market, though it is unclear what the EU would demand for such a deal.  One option would be a long transitional arrangement that would preserve a British quasi-membership for years to come. Or the negotiations could be extended beyond the expected leaving date of March 2019. Immigration would be the hardest riddle to solve: Big businesses want cheap labor but many British voters see leaving the EU as a way to stop the unlimited immigration from the bloc that membership of the single market implies.  For Brexiteers, an EU exit that left Britain so close to the bloc - and so subject to EU regulation - would be a sellout. 2) Brexit Never Brexit doesn't happen: The $2.5 trillion economy stalls, prompting calls for a second EU referendum that - if held during a deep recession - could produce a vote to remain in the EU.      Many are secretly and shockingly praying for a recession: they want people weeping in the streets from economic pain so that they can have a second EU referendum,  said Richard Tice, who helped found one of the two Leave campaign groups.  If that happened all bets would be off and we would be in a democratic and constitutional crisis in Britain the likes of which none of us have ever seen in our lifetimes.  If the Brexit decision was reversed by a second vote, the Article 50 notice that triggered formal divorce talks would be withdrawn, though there is no legal certainty on how, and Britain would remain a member of the EU.  Other routes to a Brexit halt include disrupting the British government's exit legislation, battling Brexit in the courts or the rise of a credible pro-EU politician who could challenge the consensus and the leaderships of both major political parties. A European Union flag is waved in front of Big Ben outside Parliament after Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May triggered the process by which the United Kingdom will leave the European Union in London, March 28, 2017.Stefan WermuthFrench President Emmanuel Macron has said the EU's door remains open, and German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble has also indicated Britain could be welcomed back. European Council President Donald Tusk even invoked the lyrics of John Lennon to imagine a Brexit rescinded. Many opponents of Brexit - the  Remainers  -  would rejoice, though a reluctant and divided member of the EU could hinder European attempts at further integration.  If all went well, the two parties may want to remarry even before they have divorced,  said billionaire investor George Soros. Cancelling Brexit or holding a second EU referendum would trigger a major crisis in Britain with uncertain consequences.  The election result is certainly a bump in the road for Brexiteers, but its significance should not be overplayed,  said Matthew Elliott, who was chief executive of Vote Leave, the official leave campaign in last year's referendum.  Recalcitrant Remain supporters are understandably buoyant but, as with their Article 50 hopes, their optimism will be shown to be misplaced.   May has been clear Brexit will happen. 3) Disorderly Brexit With her authority so weakened, May will have to gauge whether she can get a deal from the EU that she can sell at home. If she thinks she will fail to get a Brexit deal through parliament, some business leaders fear she will allow talks with the EU to collapse and take Britain out with no deal. A disorderly Brexit could spook financial markets, tarnish London's reputation as one of the world's top two financial centers and sow chaos through the economies of Britain and the EU by dislocating trading relationships. May repeatedly said during the election campaign that  no deal is better than a bad deal , though she has been less forthright since the election result. A crisis in the EU or euro zone could persuade Britain to walk out without an agreement. 4) a Theresa May Brexit  Theresa May has proposed a clean break from the European Union, making control over immigration and ending the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice the priorities. She has said that this entails leaving the single market and customs union, but that she wants a trade deal to secure the best possible access to the bloc. May has said she will work with lawmakers, businesses and the devolved administrations in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales to reach a consensus on Brexit. On Thursday she set out what she called a  fair deal  for EU citizens living in Britain, saying in her first test of negotiating strength that she did not want anyone to have to leave because of Brexit or to split up families. But many observers believe May will no longer be prime minister when Britain leaves the EU.

The Commerce Department said on Friday new home sales increased 2.9 percent to a seasonally adjusted rate of 610,000 units last month. April's sales pace was also revised sharply higher to 593,000 units from 569,000 units. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast new home sales, which make up about 10 percent of all home sales, rising 5.4 percent to a pace of 597,000 units last month. Sales were up 8.9 percent on a year-on-year basis in May.  While the data quality of the new home sales report is notoriously poor, the general picture from this report and the existing home sales report is one of solid housing demand in the important spring selling season,  said Michael Feroli, an economist with J.P. Morgan. The housing market has been bolstered by continued strong job growth. The unemployment rate fell to a 16-year low of 4.3 percent in May and mortgage rates are still favorable by historical standards. However, an increase in the cost of building materials and shortages of lots and labor have crimped homebuilding. With demand outstripping supply, house prices remain elevated. The median house price rose to a record high of $345,800 in May, from $310,200 in the prior month. The average sales price last month was $406,400, also a record high. The U.S. dollar pared losses against the yen after the data. U.S. stocks were trading modestly higher while prices of U.S. Treasuries edged up.

The inventory of new homes on the market increased 1.5 percent to 268,000 units last month. At May's sales rate, it would take 5.3 months to clear inventory, unchanged from April.

The dollar fell against a basket of major currencies as preliminary data on U.S. factory and services activities in June fell short of analyst forecasts, stoking doubts about U.S. economic growth for the rest of 2017. That drop in the greenback helped crude oil pull away from 10-month lows, although prices were still set for their worst first-half performance since 1997. On the week, both Brent and WTI crude have lost nearly 4 percent.  Oil is probably trying to recoup some of the losses that they’ve had this week,  said Jim Davis, regional investment manager at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Springfield, Illinois. U.S. crude rose 0.84 percent to $43.10 per barrel and Brent was last at $45.64, up 0.93 percent on the day. The climb in crude helped lift energy stocks on Wall Street, with the group up 0.8 percent as the best performing of the major S&P; sectors. The U.S. dollar briefly managed to recoup some of its declines after economic data showed new U.S. single-family home sales rose in May and the median sales price surged to an all-time high. The PHLX housing index advanced 0.7 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 14.29 points, or 0.07 percent, to 21,411.58, the S&P; 500 gained 4.95 points, or 0.20 percent, to 2,439.45 and the Nasdaq Composite added 15.91 points, or 0.26 percent, to 6,252.60.  The data has been mixed today and it kind of reflects what has been going on all month and that is the economy, both globally and in the U.S., we are expanding but the pace of expansion is not accelerating,  Davis said. The slide in energy prices in recent weeks has worsened the outlook for inflation, creating a problem for the world's major central banks as they attempt to normalize interest rates after years of ultra-loose policy. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index lost 0.18 percent and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.25 percent. The dollar index fell 0.37 percent, with the euro up 0.44 percent to $1.1199. The dollar peaked at a one-month high on Tuesday following comments with a hawkish tone from Fed officials including New York Fed President William Dudley and Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren. But it has been stuck in a tight range since and virtually flat on the week. Earlier on Friday, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said the central bank should wait on any further rate increases until it is clear inflation is reliably heading to the Fed's 2 percent target. Fed Board Governor Jerome Powell and Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester also are due to speak on Friday. The lower dollar also helped boost gold prices, but the prospect of further interest rate rises in the United States limited gains. Spot gold added 0.4 percent to $1,255.71 an ounce. U.S. gold futures gained 0.58 percent to $1,256.70 an ounce. Reporting by Chuck Mikolajczak; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/global-markets-idUSL1N1JK0MA"},

It has been a six months marked, first, by the crumbling of so-called Trump trades that were premised on U.S. President Donald Trump's pledges of multi-trillion dollar spending. The second feature has been a political and growth outlook shift in Europe which has lured investors back to the continent. As this graphic shows reut.rs/2sxO66c 16-17 percent gains in emerging markets and Europe on a dollar-adjusted basis have boosted world stocks around 10 percent so far this year. Oil on the other hand is 2017's worst performer, despite almost 2 million barrels-per-day of OPEC supply cuts. Undercut by high output from shale and some producers such as Nigeria, Brent crude futures have slumped 20 percent in their biggest first-half drop since 1997. The price moves have rekindled memories of the 50 percent rout seen in the second half of 2014. But equities have held up well despite a hefty tech share selloff earlier in June and a run of softer U.S. economic data which hint at slowing price growth and a major setback for the  Trumpflation  trades in vogue at the start of 2017. Despite two Federal Reserve rate hikes already this year, the dollar has fallen 4.5 percent against the world's other top currencies -- its worst start to a year since 2006.  From a global perspective it is increasing the appetite for risky assets,  said ABN Amro's chief investment officer Didier Duret. Duret also noted the defeat for far-right, anti-establishment parties in French and Dutch elections, as well as a synchronised recovery in world growth. The euro zone is seen growing 2 percent this year, its best run in a decade, while latest data shows consumer confidence at a 16-year high. In Brexit-bound Britain, which has just been through a messy election, the pound has dropped 3 percent against the euro, whereas UK government bonds and the FTSE 100 have risen 2.4 and 6.4 percent respectively. Emerging markets too have enjoyed a trade and growth bounce.  There is a growing recognition we are seeing accumulative stability, with lower volatility and lower correlation between assets and this is constructive for creating momentum for equities,  Duret said. While U.S. stocks have returned almost 10 percent year-to-date, many investors reckon European stocks offer better value - funds polled by Reuters every month have just upped euro zone equity exposure to a nine-month high.  Previously there were lots of reasons not to invest in Europe. Now Europe is growing faster than the U.S.,  said Pictet Asset Management's chief strategist Luca Paolini, who prefers European and emerging stocks. The past week has seen biggest U.S. equity outflows in five weeks. Perfect Landing Emerging markets have shrugged off the U.S. rate rises and the oil and tech tumbles. While emerging equities are the top performers, bonds in emerging market currencies have returned almost 10 percent in dollar terms, while hard currency sovereign debt is up 6 percent.  At the end of last year, everyone was long dollar but suddenly people realised the dollar was getting weaker. Usually when that happens it's very good for EM assets,  said Francois Savary, CIO of Swiss investment manager Prime Partners. There is likely room for more gains in the coming year, given the sector has underperformed for five years, he added. But within emerging markets there are losers as well as winners: tmsnrt.rs/2dZbdP5 Russian equities, heavily oil-reliant and a star of late 2016, have lost 17 percent but energy importer Turkey's stock index has risen 30 percent, despite inflation, domestic political risks and policy wobbles. The Mexican peso is the world's top performing currency, up 14 percent on the dollar, as faith wanes in Trump's ability to implement anti-trade and anti-immigration pledges. Perhaps the biggest surprise has been Poland's zloty which has surged more than 10 percent against the dollar, outstripping the euro's 5.8 percent rise. Brazil's real has been one of the worst-performing currencies, down 5 percent in 2017 due to fresh corruption scandals that have hit the country.  The question for the next six months is how far the positive European momentum should go,  said ABN's Duret.  And can China control its slowdown. Can it continue to achieve a perfect soft landing?

It was a classic mob hit in the heart of the Sicilian capital. People claimed to have seen nothing and only one person admitted to even hearing the gunfire. A month on, no one has been arrested. Released from prison in 2014, Dainotti, 67, had served more than two decades in jail for murder. The motive for his own murder are not clear but police say the first high-profile Mafia hit in Palermo since 2010 may signal renewed internal strife.  The Mafia today is in search of a new leadership at a time when a lot of the old bosses are coming out of prison,  said Palermo police chief, Renato Cortese.   The danger is that some bigwig will be released and try to put the Mafia back together again,  he told Reuters. Once all-powerful on Sicily, the world's most famous crime gang, known as Cosa Nostra,  Our Thing , has been squeezed over the past two decades, with many bosses put behind bars, many of its businesses sequestered and many locals ready to defy it. Despite these setbacks, no one believes it is dying. Indeed, after years of decline, with the Calabrian 'Ndrangheta overtaking it as Italy's most powerful mobsters, prosecutors believe it is trying to rebuild, starting with its drug trade.  The mafia organization is once again looking to develop and maintain a total monopoly on the extremely profitable narcotics market,  Matteo Frasca, the head of Palermo's Appeals Court, said in a speech in January. Italian prosecutors say the 'Ndrangheta has a stranglehold on cocaine trade, but Cosa Nostra is a major player in the Italian hashish market, often importing the drug from northern Africa and selling it throughout Europe. In March, police found 400 kg (880 lb) of hashish, worth an estimated 3 million euros ($3.4 million), floating just off the Sicilian coast after a drop-off went awry. In May, police seized around 300 kg of hashish in a single raid in Palermo.  For a while, the Mafia depended on public work scams and extortion rackets for much of their money, but with the economy in such a dire straits here, they are returning to their old drug habits,  said a senior anti-Mafia magistrate, who declined to be named because he was not authorized to speak publicly. Shopkeepers' Revolt Sicily's economic output fell more than 13 percent between 2008 and 2015 and is only slowly recovering, while the jobless rate is 22 percent, twice the national average. The deep recession has made it much more difficult for hard-up businesses to pay protection money, or  pizzo  in Italian, to the Mafia and more than 1,000 firms have revolted against paying that in Palermo alone in little more than a decade. In May, the trial started of nine men accused of extorting cash from a dozen stores in the city's central Via Maqueda, which were all run by foreigners, mainly Bangladeshis. Italian police officers stand on the site where mafia boss Giuseppe Dainotti was shot to death while riding his bicycle in Palermo, Italy May 22, 2017. Picture taken May 22, 2017.Guglielmo Mangiapane NO RESALES. NO ARCHIVES It is an extraordinary affair. For the first time in Palermo, a group of foreign storekeepers rebelled. They rebelled together. It was a collective action,  said Daniele Marannano, coordinator of Addiopizzo,  Goodbye pizzo . Addiopizzo is a grassroots civic movement that encourages companies to fight back against Cosa Nostra.  Lots of businesses still pay the pizzo, but they now want something back from the Mafia for their money - help fixing prices in their neighborhood, help keeping difficult employees in check, help collecting unpaid bills,  said Marannano. A local businessman, who declined to be named because of the sensitivities involved, said one of the consequences of the Mafia's decline was a rise in petty crime.  He complained that fruit groves operated by his family food company were regularly raided at night by small-time thieves.  That never used to happen in the past. A fly couldn't land on a fruit tree without permission first from the Mafia.  Slideshow (4 Images)Power Struggle The state's fight against the Mafia only got serious in 1992 after the group murdered two of Italy's top magistrates, Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino, triggering national outrage and finally forcing complacent politicians to act. Successive governments introduced waves of anti-Mafia laws, allowing the state to seize mob assets, keep imprisoned mafiosi incommunicado and far from Sicily, and develop protection programs for informers. As a result, hundreds of mafiosi have been arrested over the past 25 years, including Salvatore  Toto  Riina, the Boss of Bosses, who ordered the murders of Falcone and Borsellino. He is 86 and believed to be terminally ill and likely to die in jail.  However, many other less prominent mobsters who were caught up in the big anti-Mafia trials of the last two decades have either been freed, like Dainotti, or else are coming up for release, like Riina's nephew Giovanni Grizzaffi.  The last Boss of Bosses was Riina. He was never formally replaced and people felt kept in check by him, even when he was in jail. When he dies, you might see a power struggle,  said police chief Cortese, who has a photograph of Falcone and Borsellino hanging in his office. Dainotti was shot dead on the eve of the 25th anniversary of Falcone's killing, leaving police and politicians wondering whether the date had been specially picked to signal that the Mafia was back in action. Rosario Crocetta, the governor of Sicily and anti-Mafia crusader, has been the target of at least three mob plots to kill him, most recently in 2010. He says the group is much reduced, but ever evolving.  They are chameleons,  he said, two bodyguards standing alongside his table at an outdoors cafe.  You are never going to win total victory over the Mafia, just as you can never totally defeat evil.

The procedures should be standardized using best practices, the study authors argue in the Aesthetic Surgery Journal. Breast enlargement is the most commonly performed cosmetic surgery worldwide, the authors write, with more than 1.5 million procedures done in 2015. “Breast augmentation surgery remains one of the most frequently performed aesthetic surgical procedures, with trends increasing,” said senior author Dr. Niclas Broer of Technical University Teaching Hospital in Munich, Germany. “However, there exists a plethora of possible technical approaches, and the procedure is not very standardized,” he told Reuters Health by email. “This is very interesting but also almost a little bit concerning.” Broer and colleagues analyzed responses from 628 surgeons around the world to a 38-question online survey. The surgeons were asked about current controversies, new technologies, common practices, technical considerations, and characteristics of their patients.  In most countries in Europe, Asia and Oceania, surgeons use anatomically shaped implants, whereas in the United States and Latin America, 90 percent use round implants. Surgeons ranked the higher cost and lack of proof of aesthetic superiority as the top reasons why they don’t use anatomical implants more often.  “The different use of round versus shaped implants is striking,” Broer said. “Is the U.S. slow to embrace the use of a new technology, or do patients in the U.S. prefer a different look?” Worldwide, more than 80 percent of surgeons only use 100 percent silicone implants. In the U.S., just 22 percent of surgeons use them.  More than two-thirds of surgeons in the U.S. and Australia use implants larger than 300 cc, or approximately two cup sizes, and in the U.S., more than a third use implant sizes larger than 350 cc, the study also found.  Practices differ by technique and post-surgery treatment as well. Many use similar incisions to create an implant pocket, and most use antibiotics as anesthesia begins. In the U.S. and Asia, however, more than half of surgeons recommend a postoperative implant massage, while surgeons in all other countries don’t.  The study authors found one worldwide agreement - the majority of surgeons said implants don't make it harder to detect abnormalities on mammograms. “It is important for patients to have high quality information during the decision-making process to reduce the inherent risk that surgery has,” said Dr. Carlos Rubi Ona of IMED Hospitals in Valencia, Spain, who wasn’t involved in the study. “Aesthetic surgery is a cosmetic procedure, but we should not forget that it carries the same risk of complications, if not even more, as many other non-aesthetic procedures,” he told Reuters Health by email. In most other surgical procedures, certain operative approaches are considered standard universally. Slight variations exist, but for the most part, a consistent standard draws from current research and accepted practice, Broer said. “Why should breast augmentation surgery be any different?” he said. “If, for instance, it has been shown that silicone implants provide superior outcomes, why are so many women still receiving an inferior product?” Broer and colleagues suggest creating an international task force that meets yearly to evaluate best practices and new evidence to standardize the procedure. This should include guidelines about antibiotics, incision technique and location, and implant pockets, Broer said. “Augmentation surgery should be taken as seriously as a colon resection or gallbladder removal,” he said. “If we found international practice differences for those, it would almost be a scandal.” SOURCE: bit.ly/2tTRCFt Aesthetic Surgery Journal, online June 7, 2017.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-breasts-implants-idUSKBN19E1TN"},

Ford announced on Tuesday it would move some production of its Focus small car to China instead of Mexico, a step that follows the U.S. automaker's January cancellation of a planned $1.8 billion plant in the central state of San Luis Potosi. The scrapping of the Ford plant was a bitter blow, coming after U.S. President Donald Trump had blamed the country for hollowing out U.S manufacturing on the campaign trail, and threatened to impose hefty tariffs on cars made in Mexico. Since then, rhetoric from the Trump administration has become more conciliatory, and Mexico and the United States have expressed confidence that the renegotiation of the NAFTA trade deal, expected to begin in August, could benefit both nations. But the loss of the Focus business is an unwelcome reminder of competition Mexico faces from Asia at a time China's auto exports and the quality of its cars are rising.  For a long time, the quality of vehicles coming out of China was not to global standards. There was a gap in quality that (favored) Mexico - but that is closing,  said Philippe Houchois, an analyst covering the auto industry at investment bank Jefferies.  That is probably a threat to Mexico.  In the past decade, global automakers have invested heavily in Chinese factories to make them capable of building cars at quality levels that make the grade in developed markets. Ford's decision to shift Focus production for the United States market to China from Mexico shows automakers have increasing flexibility to choose between the two countries to supply niche vehicles to American consumers or other markets. 'Very Troubling' Demand for small cars in the United States is waning and General Motors Co faces a similar situation to Ford's with its Chevrolet Cruze compact. Were GM to go down the same path with the Cruze and shift its production out of U.S. factories, it could give more work to its Mexican plants - but might also bring its Chinese operations in Shenyang or Yantai into play. GM did not immediately reply to a request for comment on its plans for the Cruze. Studies show Mexican manufacturing is competitive, and business leaders believe that NAFTA talks between Mexico, the United States and Canada could ultimately yield tougher regional content rules for the region that benefit local investment. Ford said its decision balanced cheaper Chinese labor rates against pricier shipping, but that in the end an already-planned refit of its Chinese factory saved it some $500 million over retooling both that facility and its Hermosillo plant in Mexico. The volatile state of U.S.-Mexican trade relations also carries big risks if Trump renews his threats to impose 35-percent tariffs on cars made in Mexico. To be sure, Trump has also threatened to levy 45-percent tariffs on Chinese goods and his Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said he found Ford's China move  very troubling.  Trump's threats have battered the peso, ironically making Mexico's goods cheaper. Uncertainty over the future of NAFTA pushed the currency to a record low in January, although it has since rebounded. That same month, the Boston Consulting Group published an assessment of manufacturing competitiveness that gave Mexico an 11-percent lead over China. That advantage has prompted global firms to plow billions of dollars into the Mexican auto industry, pushing output to record highs. Some officials in the automotive sector painted Ford's move as a one-off decision.  There's still very dynamic investment and growth in plants,  said Alfredo Arzola, director of the automotive cluster in Guanajuato state, one of Mexico's top carmaking hubs. Still, there have been  significant quality improvements  in Chinese cars, consultancy J.D. Power said in a 2016 study. Chinese car manufacturing could catch up with international standards in China by 2018 or 2019, said Jacob George, general manager of J.D. Power's Asia Pacific Operations, citing the consultancy's gauge of  hard quality , or failures. However, when measured in terms of  perceptual  quality, China was probably still some 4 to 6 years behind, he added.

The world's largest automaker is overhauling its biggest division by sales to generate funds to invest in electric cars and self-driving technology as it struggles to overcome its emissions-cheating scandal. More than 7,500 workers have accepted offers of early retirement since a hard-fought turnaround plan was signed with unions last November, about 80 percent of the 9,300 pledges VW had budgeted for by 2020, group HR boss Karlheinz Blessing said in an interview with Reuters. To stoke demand for the measure, the carmaker has restricted until July 31 an offer to workers and managers born between 1955 and 1960 to take early retirement, the executive said.  Whoever comes later has missed an opportunity,  Blessing said.  I believe we will achieve our targets on staff reduction sooner than planned.  Investors have said a turnaround at the VW brand, long saddled with high development and personnel costs, will be key to turn the crisis-ridden group into a more attractive business. VW plans to raise productivity at its German plants by 7.5 percent this year and next, and a further 5 percent in 2019 and 2020, counting on fixed-cost cuts and fine-tuning of R&D;, procurement and production operations. The carmaker is seeking to raise its brand operating margin to near the upper end of a 2.5-to-3.5 percent range this year, from 1.8 percent in 2016. That's still below profitability benchmarks at European rivals such as Peugeot Citroen (PEUP.PA) and Renault (RENA.PA).  It's a long way  to lastingly raise profitability, said Blessing.  2018, 2019 and 2020 will be the challenging years.    VW is also moving fast with efforts to weed out temporary jobs. The core brand has slashed the number of temporary positions to around 2,600 now from 6,500 when the turnaround plan was launched, and aims to cut them further to around 1,000 by year-end, he said. The carmaker has a goal to work without any temporary jobs in its home market by the end of 2020.  Management and unions have agreed to cut up to 23,000 jobs and, in return, create 9,000 new positions in the area of battery production and mobility services. Headcount may fall further due to  natural  turnover and buyouts which VW has not yet offered, Blessing said.  We have enough instruments to carry out the reduction in staff in a socially acceptable way.

Rich from producing oil and gas, Norway has invested more than $1.1 billion in an Amazon Fund since 2008 to help Brazil protect the forests, which are under threat from logging and their conversion to farmland.  I expressed concern that deforestation has risen somewhat (in recent years after past successes),  Prime Minister Erna Solberg told reporters after talks with Temer, who is visiting Oslo to promote investment in Brazil after a trip to Moscow. Temer said Brazil was working to protect the Amazon, for example, by expanding national parks.  Brazil is one of the biggest, if not the biggest, environmental reserves in the world,  he said. Norway's Environment Ministry said payments, under a performance-based plan to reward forest protection, were likely to be about $35 million in 2017, around $65 million less than the previous year when fewer forests were destroyed.  This should not in any way be understood as a weakening of our commitment to the partnership,  Environment Minister Vidar Helgesen said in a statement.  On the contrary, we stand by our commitments, and if deforestation is brought back down, our payments will go back up.

Recent losses, however, are far below the 19,000 sq km recorded in 2005, Brazilian satellite data show. Solberg reaffirmed a 2015 agreement to extend the forest pact until 2020.  I see no reason to renegotiate that agreement,  she said. Outside Solberg's office, about 40 people protested against Temer with banners featuring slogans such as  stop rainforest destruction .   We're here to show that people in Norway are extremely concerned by the rise in deforestation,  Lars Loevold, head of the Rainforest Foundation Norway, told Reuters. He also said that Temer should do more for indigenous people.

The paper quoted Chief Executive Officer Luis Stuhlberger as saying Verde, which oversees about 21 billion reais ($6.29 billion) in its namesake flagship family of funds, had half of that allocated in so-called NTN-B notes of short duration. Short durations increase sensitivity to interest-rate cuts. Assuming that inflation-adjusted rates decline to 4 percent in a year or two, the NTN-B note maturing in 2022 seems  a good investment  yield 5.6 percent now, Stuhlberger told the newspaper. Verde's media relations firm confirmed his remarks. In the interview, Stuhlberger said Verde's failed bets in recent years might stem from an  optical illusion  among investors that things in Brazil will stay business as usual, despite mounting fiscal and political challenges. For months, Verde has argued that investors in Brazil were overly complacent about President Michel Temer's ability to implement an ambitious economic reform agenda - seen as critical to curbing public debt growth and pulling the economy out of a recession entering a third year. Verde's global calls include a short-selling position on the Chinese renminbi, underscoring a bet that the Asian country's currency is mispriced amid fiscal largesse, Valor said.

We promise - Air Berlin and Niki are back at cruising altitude,  the carrier's chief operating officer Goetz Ahmelmann wrote in an email sent to customers on Friday, apologising for the delays. Niki is Air Berlin's unit that operates flights to mainly tourist destinations. Air Berlin, 29 percent-owned by Abu Dhabi based Etihad, last year made a record net loss of 782 million euros. Its woes this year have been compounded by a switch to a new ground handling company at Berlin's Tegel airport at the end of March, which has resulted in delays and baggage problems. In May, just 54.2 percent of Air Berlin's flights were on time, according to data from OAG flightview. That compares with 80.1 percent in February, before the ground handling switch. Niki's on-time rate was 61 percent in May and 68.5 percent in February. The carrier this month asked the German states of North-Rhine Westphalia and Berlin to consider possible loan guarantees amid signs of waning support from Etihad but said on Thursday they were no longer required after it made progress with restructuring. In the email, Ahmelmann said Air Berlin had taken on more staff and made changes to its flight plan at its home airport of Berlin Tegel. It has previously said it plans to do more flying from its other hub in Duesseldorf in the future.  The punctuality and the reliability of our flight operations has since significantly improved. You can therefore book your Air Berlin and Niki flight with confidence,  he wrote.

Analysts from Japanese bank Nomura were the first major house on Thursday to flip to calling for a rise in rates this year, after the defection over the past week of three members of the BoE's policy committee to the camp backing higher rates.  Policy hawk, Kristin Forbes, in her last speech before leaving the bank, urged colleagues on Thursday evening to raise rates immediately to quell the inflation pressure stemming from a weaker pound.  Sterling racked up a solid 0.4 percent gain against the dollar on Friday, to trade at $1.2732. It was flat at 87.95 pence per euro.   We think rates will be on hold for the next year - but the market has definitely started pricing in the chance of a hike in the next six months,  said Rabobank strategist Piotr Matys.  That is clearly giving sterling some support.  Short-term UK market interest rates have shifted since a speech by the Bank's chief economist, Andy Haldane, earlier this week, with short sterling pricing in a strong chance of a rise in rates by December.  Barclays economists said that while they stuck with their call for rates to stay on hold, there was a risk the Bank would hike in November, and start to prepare markets for that move in August.  U.S. bank JP Morgan also warned that the risks of a rise this year had increased, given a series of higher-than-expected inflation numbers, which most put down to the weakness of the pound.  The BoE has signalled it has limits about the scale of the overshoot it is willing to tolerate - especially given the persistence of currency-induced shocks on inflation,  JPM economist Allan Monks said in a note on Friday.  Governor Mark Carney, however, said earlier in the week it was too early to move, and any rise in rates would put aside signs that the UK economy - and household demand - are currently ill-equipped to swallow higher borrowing costs.  The pound continues to suffer because of political uncertainties generated by Brexit talks and a snap election this month which left Prime Minister Theresa May short of a majority in parliament.   We're not here to tell the BOE what they should do, we're here to figure out what they are most likely to do,  Nomura's Jordan Rochester said in the bank's note to clients changing its forecast for UK rates.  Whilst it may not be in line with Governor Carney's Mansion House speech, we ... now expect the MPC to raise rates for the first time in a decade at its next meeting in August.

A fuel glut in China, a hangover from demonetization in India, and an ageing, declining population in Japan are holding back crude oil demand growth in three of the world's top four oil buyers.  The three countries make up a fifth of 97 million barrels per day (bpd) in global oil consumption, and any hiccups among them will mean lower-than-expected oil demand growth in Asia, helping to undercut the OPEC-led effort to support prices.   We are indeed seeing lower demand from more than a few clients - air, marine, road, industrial ... They are actually consuming less fuel than anticipated,  said Michael Corley, managing director of Mercatus Energy Advisors. In China, vying with the United States as the world's biggest oil importer, imports in May were still at a near record of 9 million bpd, but a looming cut in refinery operations is set to hit demand for crude oil in the third quarter.  In India, which overtook Japan as the world's third-biggest oil importer last year, crude imports fell by more than 4 percent between April and May to around 4.2 million bpd C-INIMP, as after-effects of the country's recent demonetization program hit consumption.  For the first five months of the year, India's imports are about flat to the same period last year, following an annual rise of 7.4 percent last year.  In Japan, Asia's most advanced economy, oil demand has been in structural decline for years due to a declining, ageing  population, and the rise of cars with better mileage or that use alternative fuels. Japan in April imported around 3.5 million bpd C-JPIMPTOT, down from a peak of 5.9 million bpd hit in 2005.  FILE PHOTO: Oil tankers are seen in Shandong Haike Group in Dongying, Shandong province, China January 11, 2017.Aizhu Chen/File PhotoCoupled with plentiful supplies, the stuttering demand in Asia has contributed to a 20 percent price fall for Brent crude oil LCOc1 to around $45 per barrel, in what is the biggest slump in a first half of a year since 1997.  Floating Storage In the latest indicator of a supply overhang, traders said that five very large crude carriers (VLCCs) have been chartered in recent days to store unsold oil.  FILE PHOTO: Storm clouds gather over Shell's Pulau Bukom oil refinery in Singapore January 30, 2016.Edgar Su/File PhotoEach VLCC can hold around 2 million barrels of oil, and the five chartered for storage add to around 25 supertankers already sitting in southern Malaysian waters.  In a market condition known as contango, where spot crude oil prices are cheaper than those for future delivery, it is profitable to store oil for a later sales. Currently, spot Brent is almost $1.50 a barrel cheaper than that for delivery in early 2018. <0#LCO:>  If oil prices head lower, floating storage will get more traction,  said Ashok Sharma, managing director of ship broker BRS Baxi in Singapore.  The cheap spot price comes despite the effort led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to cut production by 1.8 bpd that has been in place since January. Doubts over OPEC's compliance with its own targets and soaring U.S. output have led to scepticism that markets will re-balance soon.   The slide in oil prices continues ... as markets remain skeptical of OPEC's ability to balance supplies,  ANZ bank said on Friday.

China's internet shares tumbled after news of the unusually harsh clamp down spread, with Weibo Corp's (WB.O) down 6.1 percent, while SINA Corp (SINA.O), which has a stake in Weibo, fell 4.8 percent. That amounted to a combined $1.3 billion knock to the market value of both companies. The Twitter-like service Sina Weibo, popular online video site ACFUN and news portal iFeng.com will have to stop video streaming services that violate the country's regulations, the TV and film watchdog said on Thursday.  This will provide a clean and clear Internet space for the wide number of online users,  the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television said in a brief statement on its website. While the move is likely to send a chill through China's booming online entertainment industry, analysts expect the country's social media providers will be able to adjust to a tougher regulatory environment although with more limited content offerings. Beijing tightly controls its internet space and bans content that it deems politically threatening or damaging to China's national identity. It has increasingly taken aim at the country's booming internet industry.  The TV and film watchdog did not give a timeline for the ban, but analysts say it is more than likely the services will open again with beefed-up oversight.  Instead of a slap on the wrist, it's a slap all the way up the arm, the neck and the head. But it's still a slap, it's not a kill shot,  said Beijing-based director of Marbridge Consulting Mark Natkin. Sina Weibo's booth is pictured at the Global Mobile Internet Conference (GMIC) 2017 in Beijing, China April 28, 2017.Jason LeeIt follows the controversial shuttering of 60 popular celebrity gossip social media accounts last week by China's cyberspace authorities, who said the sites catered to poor tastes and did not  actively propagate core socialist values . In May, it released regulations for online news sites and network portals that expanded restrictions on content and required all services to be overseen by party-sanctioned editorial staff. Several online video portals, including iFeng, have been publicly reprimanded in the last six months for conducting live-streamed interviews and other news gathering activities without state authorization.  I think this [recent] ban is much more serious than the ones before,  a former iFeng employee, who worked at the firm until recently and declined to be identified, told Reuters.   The video department is a very important part of (iFeng). When the live stream service was reprimanded previously, it was a great blow. Now, they will feel even more nervous.  iFeng.com did not respond to a request for comment while ACFUN released a statement on social media saying it would attempt to remedy the issues. Weibo said it was communicating with relevant government authorities to understand the scope of the notice. Users of the video sites took to Weibo's microblog on Friday to share their frustration.

June 23 (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve should wait on any further rate increases until it is clear inflation is reliably heading to the Fed's 2 percent target, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said on Friday, highlighting the central bank's struggle over how to weigh a recent slip in the rate of price increases.  Recent inflation data have surprised to the downside and call into question the idea that U.S. inflation is reliably returning toward target,  Bullard said at an Illinois Bankers Association conference.  The Fed can wait and see how the economy develops before making any further adjustments to the policy rate.  The Fed raised rates at its meeting last week with only one dissenting vote. But the policy statement flagged concern over a recent fall in the Fed's preferred measure of inflation to 1.5 percent, and Fed officials since then have appeared split between those worried the trend may persist and those who feel the Fed needs to tighten still-loose monetary policy as a precaution. The central bank is also debating how to synchronize its next rate increase with its plan to begin reducing its $4 trillion in asset holdings, a step that at the margins could raise market interest rates. Bullard, who regards the economy as stuck in a low-growth rut, said he sees little reason to rush the process. Even though a low unemployment rate of 4.3 percent would, in theory, lead to higher inflation and provide a reason for raising rates now, Bullard said there is little evidence that is going to happen anytime soon. Is U.S. inflation  about to increase substantially? The short answer is no, based on current estimates of the relationship between unemployment and inflation,  Bullard said. Bullard does not currently vote on the Fed's policy-setting committee. He has argued that the Fed should not raise rates any more until it is clear the economy has shifted to a higher growth, higher inflation  regime.

Cobalt 27's initial public offering highlights the burgeoning market for cobalt as the car industry's push towards electric vehicles gathers pace. The company's shares were trading at C$9.17 at 1351 GMT, against an offer price of $9 and an earlier high C$9.50. Cobalt 27 owns close to 2,160 tonnes of cobalt -- worth about $125 million, according to London Metal Exchange prices. The cobalt is stored in warehouses in Baltimore, Antwerp and Rotterdam. Most cobalt is a byproduct of copper and nickel production by miners such as Glencore, Canada's Sherritt International and China Molybdenum.  We're a pure play on cobalt and a thematic play on electric vehicles,  Cobalt 27 Chief Executive Anthony Milewski told Reuters.  Our cobalt can be traced back to the producer. It hasn't been produced by child labour.  That is a reference to artisinal mining in places such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, where individuals mine independently to produce metal, often illegally and under poor health and safety conditions. Congo's rich cobalt deposits -- it accounts for almost two thirds of global output -- has also attracted fellow Canadian resources company First Cobalt, which is investing there despite the central African nation's turbulent political environment. As Milewski indicated, the interest is largely down to cobalt's use in lithium-ion batteries used to power electric vehicles, which are expected to become increasingly popular as governments clamp down on polluting fossil fuels such as gasoline and diesel. UBS recently raised its forecasts for global sales of electronic vehicles in 2021 to 3.1 million units from 2.5 million and to 14.2 million by 2025 from 9.7 million. It expects electric vehicles to account for 3.1 percent of global car sales in 2021 and 13.7 percent in 2025, against 1 percent this year.  Commodity markets in the lithium battery supply chain would be most disrupted by a rapid increase in EV (electric vehicle) penetration, in particular lithium, cobalt and graphite,  UBS analysts said recently.  But only cobalt faces the issue of limited reserves, whereas for the other materials current production capacity is the only bottleneck.  Cobalt 27's management is planning to grow the business through royalties and agreements with mining companies to buy all or part of their cobalt output at a fixed, predetermined price.  The company has entered into six agreements to acquire royalties on eight exploration-stage properties containing cobalt, to be acquired immediately following closing of the offering,  the company said in an investor presentation. Global demand for cobalt last year totalled about 100,000 tonnes, of which roughly half was used in batteries to power electric cars, as well as products including mobile phones, laptops, digital cameras and cordless power tools.  (Cobalt 27) needs a pipeline of secure supplies,  said Frances Hudson, global thematic strategist at Standard Life Investments, referring to the company's potential for investors looking for a piece of the cobalt action.  If the cash flows are there and they can pay a dividend, then this would be a sensible way to do it.

The 28 EU leaders signed up to a document saying they and the European Commission should look into ways to increase reciprocity in government procurement and investment.  Reciprocity is the right way. If we have for example access to public contracts in the United States, then we can say 'yes' to access to public contracts in Europe,  Merkel said, but if full access was denied then Europe would  need an answer . The leaders called on the Commission to analyze foreign investments in strategic sectors, adding they would return to the issue at a future meeting. The written conclusions to the European Union summit that ended on Friday made no mention of the bloc's two largest trading partners, the United States or China, but both were in the background of its  free and fair  trade push. The 28-nation union tried for three years to forge a trade alliance with the United States, but now sees itself as an open markets counterweight to a country whose President Donald Trump is looking at restricting steel and aluminum imports. Beijing is also in the sights of the  protection agenda  of  new French President Emmanuel Macron, described as an embrace of free trade, but with limits on foreign takeovers in areas such as energy, banking and technology, where China seeks Europe's know-how. An EU-China summit earlier this month, designed to show the two as allies in climate change after the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris accord, was overshadowed by disagreements over trade and over-production of steel.  Fair competition is better than the law of the jungle,  Macron told a news conference alongside German Chancellor Angela Merkel. France, Germany and Italy have backed the idea of allowing the EU to block Chinese investments, partly because European companies are denied similar access in China.  More pro-trade countries such as Sweden have said this is a step down the path of protectionism, while smaller eastern and southern European economies that are dependent on Chinese investment have rejected steps against Beijing. New Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said it made sense to screen foreign investments to ensure that public infrastructure or defense firms did not to fall into foreign state-owned hands.  The key thing we wanted to avoid was any effort to use this proposal as a Trojan horse for protectionism,  he said.  Trade, agreed the EU leaders, created growth and jobs, encouraging progress in trade negotiations with countries in the Americas and Asia.  I think that a time when protectionism is strongly on agendas, the European Union's commitment to a free and rule-based trading system is very important,  Merkel said. The most advanced talks are with Japan, with the EU's chief negotiator in Tokyo seeking a breakthrough that would allow a provisional deal to be signed in early July. The EU wants Japan to scrap tariffs on cheese and wine, while Tokyo is seeking greater access for cars and car parts.

Analysts from Japanese bank Nomura were the first major house on Thursday to flip to calling for a rise in rates this year, after the defection over the past week of three members of the BoE's policy committee to the camp backing higher rates.  Policy hawk, Kristin Forbes, in her last speech before leaving the bank, urged colleagues on Thursday evening to raise rates immediately to quell the inflation pressure stemming from a weaker pound.  Sterling racked up a solid 0.4 percent gain against the dollar on Friday, to trade at $1.2732. It was flat at 87.95 pence per euro.   We think rates will be on hold for the next year - but the market has definitely started pricing in the chance of a hike in the next six months,  said Rabobank strategist Piotr Matys.  That is clearly giving sterling some support.  Short-term UK market interest rates have shifted since a speech by the Bank's chief economist, Andy Haldane, earlier this week, with short sterling pricing in a strong chance of a rise in rates by December.  Barclays economists said that while they stuck with their call for rates to stay on hold, there was a risk the Bank would hike in November, and start to prepare markets for that move in August.  U.S. bank JP Morgan also warned that the risks of a rise this year had increased, given a series of higher-than-expected inflation numbers, which most put down to the weakness of the pound.  The BoE has signalled it has limits about the scale of the overshoot it is willing to tolerate - especially given the persistence of currency-induced shocks on inflation,  JPM economist Allan Monks said in a note on Friday.  Governor Mark Carney, however, said earlier in the week it was too early to move, and any rise in rates would put aside signs that the UK economy - and household demand - are currently ill-equipped to swallow higher borrowing costs.  The pound continues to suffer because of political uncertainties generated by Brexit talks and a snap election this month which left Prime Minister Theresa May short of a majority in parliament.   We're not here to tell the BOE what they should do, we're here to figure out what they are most likely to do,  Nomura's Jordan Rochester said in the bank's note to clients changing its forecast for UK rates.  Whilst it may not be in line with Governor Carney's Mansion House speech, we ... now expect the MPC to raise rates for the first time in a decade at its next meeting in August.

Critics say President Tayyip Erdogan and the Islamist-rooted AK Party are undermining modern Turkey's secular foundations by pushing a conservative agenda, including tighter regulation of alcohol and other restrictions, since coming to power in 2002. A chapter entitled  Beginning of Life and Evolution  will be deleted from the standard biology textbooks used in schools and the material will be available only to students who go on to university studies from age 18 or 19, Alparslan Durmus, head of the national education board said in an online address this week.  We are aware that if our students don't have the background to comprehend the premises and hypotheses, or if they don't have the knowledge and scientific framework, they will not be able to understand some controversial issues, so we have left out some of them,  he said. Charles Darwin's theory of evolution is rejected by both Christian and Muslim creationists, who believe God created the world as described in the Bible and the Koran, making the universe and all living things in six days. The Bible presents that as the exact time needed for creation but the Koran says  days  actually means long periods of time.  Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmus said earlier this year that Darwin theory, first published in the 19th century, was  old and rotten  and did not necessarily have to be taught.  The changes are part of a new curriculum that will go into effect at the start of the 2017-2018 academic year, and was formulated in accordance with  Turkish values , Durmus said.  A total of 51 courses programs from primary school to high school, including those at the  Imam Hatip  religious schools championed by Erdogan, have been changed. A lobby group that promotes secular education, the Egitim-Is ( Education Work ) Union has voiced concern at the changes to the curriculum, saying it reduced emphasis on the achievements of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the founder of modern Turkey who banned Islam from public life.

On the menu was minced meat, rice, beans, dates, apricots, yoghurt and fruit juices, enjoyed by around 700 grateful adults and children on Tuesday evening in the besieged area. Most sat at long plastic tables, decorated with red cloths, to enjoy the delights provided by the Adaleh Foundation, meaning justice foundation, with others grabbing spaces on rugs by the rubble. The charity, founded in 2012 to help those in eastern Ghouta affected by the ongoing war, planned to host 10 dinners, or Iftars, in different locations in the opposition-held area east of Damascus over the last 10 days of Ramadan, which ends on Saturday. The food, purchased at local markets and prepared in soup kitchens by a team of 40 foundation staff, was welcomed by 11-year-old Rou’a, who sat on a dusty rug with more than 20 friends to enjoy a post fast Iftar meal.  My friends and I in the street used to play all the time, pretending to prepare coffee or food and sit in front of the house to welcome the guests,  she said.  Today it turned to reality as we are sitting in front of our homes and eating as if we are on a trip.  A worker (R) of Adaleh Foundation breaks his fast amidst damaged buildings during the holy month of Ramadan in the rebel-held besieged town of Douma to the east of Damascus, Syria, June 18, 2017.Bassam KhabiehDouma, home to approximately 400,000 people, is the main center of the Eastern Ghouta rebel stronghold to the east of the capital which Syrian government forces have blockaded since 2013, often leading to food and medical shortages. To help with security, the Iftars were not advertised, with news of the locations instead spreading last minute via community leaders.  The difficulties we face with this type of project are the logistics of preparing the place, the required tools and food, which is lacking in the markets because of the siege,  Adaleh Foundation team leader Alaa Abu Jaafar told Reuters. Slideshow (6 Images)Each meal costs $2 and is funded by donations from non-governmental organizations across the Arab world and Europe, Jaafar said. Neighborhoods deemed the most affected by the six-year conflict were chosen as locations, with hundreds turning out each night, he added. Ahmed, 10, was delighted his Douma neighborhood was selected to host on Tuesday.  I spent a good time with my friends, this is the first time we have Iftar all together on one table,  he said.

Traders said they expect a further drop in the overnight rate to around five percent in the next few days if the government, as expected, releases its May budget allocations next week to its agencies.  We are anticipating additional cash flow from budgetary allocations to government agencies,  one currency traders said. Nigeria, which has Africa's biggest economy, distributes revenue from its crude exports among its three tiers of government - federal, state and local. A portion of state and local government revenues passes through the banking system. The country's distributable revenues rose to 462.4 billion naira in May, up from 415.7 billion naira the previous month, due to higher proceeds from corporate taxes, a government statement said late on Thursday. Traders said about 222 billion is expected to be credited to the banking system, which would help raise the volume of cash in the money market and help push down the cost of borrowing among commercial lenders. The central bank issued 20 billion naira of 356-day treasury bills at 18.6 percent and 383 million naira of 167-day T-bills at 18 percent on Friday to reduce liquidity and curb speculation on the local currency. Nigeria's money market will resume trading on Wednesday after a two-day public holiday to mark Muslim festival of Eid-al-Fitr.

The question of which warplanes Bulgaria should buy has been bounced around successive governments for more than a decade. Talks about the Sweden planes had looked to have been ditched last month when Prime Minister Boyko Borissov said an interim government should not have announced in April it would enter into negotiations. The interim government pledged to enter talks to buy eight new Gripens, made by SAAB, after approving a Defence Ministry-produced ranking which picked the Swedish jet over an offer from Portugal for secondhand U.S. F-16s and an Italian offer of secondhand Eurofighter Typhoons. But when Borissov took power, he said the previous government should not have made the call on a deal worth an estimated 1.5 billion levs ($858 million) as  the plane is not the most important thing in an army . Magnus Lewis-Olsson, Saab's head of Europe, told reporters in Sofia last week it expected to enter into talks with Bulgarian within months, suggesting the deal was still alive, as confirmed by Borissov on Friday. “Either next Wednesday or on Wednesday thereafter we will decide when to start negotiations (with Sweden),” Borissov told reporters after meeting Sweden's Prime Minister Stefan Lofven in Brussels. “I told my Swedish colleague: we are making a decision, we are negotiating with you first, then with Eurofighter,” he said, adding Bulgaria would sign the deal only after commitment about Swedish investments in the poorest European Union member. Lewis-Olsson said last week Saab was ready to discuss different financing options, including payments over a long period. Defence Minister Krassimir Karakachanov said on Friday Bulgaria would not buy the used F-16s from Portugal because the payment instalments in the first years were higher than expected. NATO member Bulgaria has said it wants to seal a deal by the year-end to acquire eight new or secondhand fighter jets between 2018 and 2022 in order to modernise its fleet and improve its compliance with the military alliance's standards. Bulgaria joined NATO in 2004 and the European Union three years later.

Gasoline consumption depends on the volume of traffic (vehicle-miles traveled) and the average fuel-economy of the cars on the road. Traffic volume in turn depends on demographic and economic factors (population, household formation, car ownership, urbanization, average incomes and employment) and to a more limited extent gasoline prices at the pump. Gasoline prices influence fuel consumption primarily through consumer choices about fuel-economy when purchasing new vehicles and choices about the amount of discretionary driving. Rising gasoline prices tend to be associated with slower growth in traffic volumes and slower growth in gasoline consumption (as measured by the volume of gasoline supplied to domestic U.S. customers). Experience shows that prices have a relatively small impact on traffic and gasoline consumption (although the precise relationship remains fiercely controversial among researchers). As a rough approximation, changes in traffic volume and fuel consumption are an order of magnitude smaller than price changes. The slump in gasoline prices between the middle of 2014 and early 2016 coincided with a marked acceleration in the growth of both vehicle-miles traveled and fuel consumption (tmsnrt.rs/2sxRvli). But gasoline prices troughed early last year and have been rising month-on-month since March 2016, and year-on-year since November 2016, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The rate of growth in both miles-driven and gasoline consumption slowed during the second half of 2016 and the first two months in 2017. More recently, however, gasoline prices have stabilized and even fallen, which should remove one of the factors inhibiting gasoline consumption growth. Pump prices have fallen nearly 5 percent since the end of April, according to data from the Energy Information Administration. Gasoline consumption has been relatively strong since the start of March, running at or near record levels set in 2016. Gasoline supplied hit record levels in two of the last four weeks, according to the snapshot provided in the EIA's  Weekly Petroleum Status Report  (WPSR). Most analysts prefer the more comprehensive but less timely data on gasoline supplied contained in the EIA's  Petroleum Supply Monthly  (PSM). But PSM also showed relatively strong gasoline consumption in March after a weak start to the year in January and February. If the fall in gasoline prices is sustained, it will likely spur more driving and the purchase of larger, more powerful vehicles, resulting in faster growth in U.S. fuel consumption in the months ahead, at least compared with the previous trend.

BlackBerry reported an unexpected 4.7 percent drop in revenue from its software and services business, whose success is at the heart of Chief Executive John Chen's turnaround plan for the company. Shares tumbled 11.8 percent to C$12.93, on track for its biggest one-day decline in about 2-1/2 years. The overall tech group was down 0.5 percent. Suncor Energy Inc advanced 1.4 percent to C$38.63, while Canadian Natural Resources Ltd rose 1.1 percent to C$38.07 as oil prices touched session highs on the back of a softer U.S. dollar. The overall energy group saw a robust 1.3 percent gain. U.S. crude prices were up 0.5 percent to $42.94 a barrel, while Brent crude added 0.5 percent to $45.46. At 10:25 a.m. ET (1425 GMT), the Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P;/TSX composite index rose 84.05 points, or 0.55 percent, to 15,303.95. Of the index's 10 main groups, eight were in positive territory. The consumer staples group, home to grocers, was down 0.3 percent. The materials group, home to miners and fertilizer companies, added 1.1 percent, with Barrick Gold Corp climbing 2.4 percent to C$21.80. Bullion prices hit a one-week high, as the weaker greenback and global geopolitical uncertainties boosted the precious metal. Gold futures rose 0.7 percent to $1,256.1 an ounce. The financials group, which accounts for about a third of the index's weight, gained 0.3 percent, with bank stocks seeing modest advances. Home Capital Group Inc extended its previous session's gains, climbing 3.4 percent to C$19.64, following news that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc made a commitment to provide financing for the alternative lender. Canadian National Railway Co was one of the most influential movers on the index, climbing 1.3 percent to C$107.03, while the overall industrials group rose 0.9 percent. In economic data, Canada's annual inflation rate cooled more than expected last month, declining to 1.3 percent in May from April's 1.6 percent, and reducing the likelihood of an interest rate hike by the Bank of Canada in July. Food prices fell on an annual basis for the eight month in a row as consumers paid less for meat and fresh fruit.

Trump,Jae Lee,John Roberts,Larry Fitzgerald,USA,COURT/DEPORTATION (UPDATE 1),Americas,United States","sector":"","content":"WASHINGTON, June 23 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday threw out a legal immigrant's drug conviction on the grounds that his lawyer had failed to advise him that he could be deported to his native South Korea if found guilty. The court ruled 6-2 in favor of Jae Lee, who ran two restaurants in Memphis, Tennessee and has lived in the United States since 1982 when he was 12. Despite the ruling, Lee could still be deported if he is tried and convicted again for the drug offense. Lee was arrested in 2009 when police found 88 ecstasy tablets in his home, and he was charged with possessing the drug with the intent to distribute, a felony crime that triggers deportation if convicted. Chief Justice John Roberts, writing on behalf of the court, said there was  substantial and uncontroverted evidence  that Lee would not have entered a guilty plea if he had known he would be deported.  But for his attorney's incompetence, Lee would certainly have known that accepting the plea agreement would certainly lead to deportation,  Roberts said. Roberts noted that Lee's chance of avoiding being convicted were slim if he did go on trial. Lee's lawyer at the time, Larry Fitzgerald, was not aware that deportation was mandatory and advised his client to plead guilty so he could avoid a likely prison sentence of three to five years. Lee pleaded guilty in June 2009 and was sentenced to one year in prison. In September 2009, Lee realized he was facing deportation proceedings, prompting him to file a claim that he received ineffective assistance of counsel in violation of his rights under the U.S. Constitution's Sixth Amendment. Lee sought Supreme Court review after the Cincinnati-based 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected his claim in June 2016. A lower court had earlier ruled against Lee in 2014. The ruling comes at a time when the administration of President Donald Trump has taken action to ramp up immigration enforcement, and the case is one of several on immigration-related themes before the justices.

Deutsche Telekom, Vodafone and Telefonica Deutschland have faced little threat until now from Drillisch, which appeals to customers on a tight budget and is known for its corny television ads featuring local celebrities.  The perception that Drillisch stands for cheap deals will change,  Chief Executive Vlasios Choulidis told Reuters.  We will be at the same level with the three big operators.   We will continue to be able to offer the best value for money, but at higher prices we will also be able to offer more. Our products will be better and prices will rise accordingly,  Choulidis said. Drillisch has been on a roadshow to convince investors to back the 1&1 deal. It needs the support of 75 percent of shareholders at an extraordinary meeting on July 25 for it to go through. The new Drillisch had been expected by analysts to become a greater threat to the more price-sensitive products offered by the three main operators, and leave the top end of the market relatively undisturbed. Bernstein analyst Dhananjay Mirchandani said when the deal was announced that it should create heightened competition in more price-conscious sections while Telefonica Deutschland said it did not expect the deal to affect its strategy.  Positive Feedback  Drillisch is in the process of a staggered stock and cash deal with United Internet that will create a business valued at 8 billion euros with more than 12 million customers, offering mobile and fixed-line products under one roof. That will make it the fourth biggest player in the German telecoms market, helped by United Internet's strong 1&1 brand and fiber network, the country's second largest, as well as having no need to invest in a mobile network. Drillisch secured access to Telefonica Deutschland's mobile network three years ago as part of the steps Telefonica needed to take to get its 8.6 billion euro acquisition of KPN's E-Plus approved. United Internet has already secured more than 30 percent of Drillisch via a Drillisch capital increase and share swap, and has made an offer of 50 euros per share to other shareholders who do not want to take part in the deal. The arrangement involves Drillisch acquiring 1&1 through another capital increase and United Internet getting a majority of Drillisch in exchange. The cash offer expires on Friday. Drillisch shares were trading at 54 euros at 1151 GMT, down 0.6 percent. The Drillisch chief executive said the deal needed a lot of explaining but once shareholders got it, they liked it.  We get decidedly positive feedback from our investors. Therefore, we are confident that we will get the approval from the shareholder meeting,  he said. UBS analyst Vikram Karnany said after meeting Drillisch management this month that the combination was attractive, mainly due to Drillisch's guaranteed access to Telefonica's network and the high cost savings likely to be achieved.  We still think there is a high likelihood of the deal approval despite concerns from some shareholders on transaction structure,  Karnany wrote in a note.  There remains low visibility on the terms of the deal.  ($1 = 0.8954 euros) Editing by Maria Sheahan and David Clarke","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-drillisch-strategy-idUSKBN19E1JJ"},

Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates have sent a 13-point list of demands apparently aimed at dismantling their tiny but wealthy neighbour's two decade-old interventionist foreign policy which has incensed them. Qatar did not immediately comment, but Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani had said on Monday Qatar would not negotiate with the four states until economic, diplomatic and travel ties cut this month were restored. The countries that imposed the sanctions accuse Qatar of funding terrorism, fomenting regional unrest and drawing too close to their enemy Iran. Qatar rejects those accusations and says it is being punished for refusing to hew to regional powers' policy of supporting authoritarian, military and hereditary rulers. The uncomprimising demands leave little prospect for a quick end to the biggest diplomatic crisis for years between Sunni Arab Gulf states, regional analysts said.  The demands are so aggressive that it makes it close to impossible to currently see a resolution of that conflict,  Olivier Jakob, a strategist at Switzerland-based oil consultancy Petromatrix, said. Washington, which is a close military ally of countries on both sides of the dispute, had called for a resolution: Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Qatar's neighbours should make their demands  reasonable and actionable . Ten Days to Comply An official from one of the four nations, who gave details of the demands on condition of anonymity, told Reuters the offer would be  void  unless Qatar complied within 10 days. The UAE has said sanctions could last for years. Qatar, the world's richest country per capita, says the sanctions amount to a  blockade , but it has ample reserves to weather the storm. The dispute is a big test for the United States, which houses the headquarters of its Middle East air power and 11,000 troops at a large base in Qatar. President Donald Trump has backed the sanctions, even as his Defense and State Departments have tried to remain neutral, resulting in in mixed signals. Trump called Qatar a  funder of terrorism at a very high level , only for his Pentagon to approve selling it $12 billion of warplanes five days later. The most powerful country in the region to back the Qatari side in the dispute has been Turkey, whose President Tayyip Erdogan has his roots in an Islamist political party similar to movements that Qatar has backed in the region. Days after the sanctions were imposed, Turkey rushed through legislation to send more troops to its base in Qatar as a sign of support. Defence Minister Fikri Isik rejected the demand to close the base, saying it would represent interference in Ankara's relations with Doha. Turkey might bolster its presence instead.  Strengthening the Turkish base would be a positive step in terms of the Gulf's security,  he said.  Re-evaluating the base agreement with Qatar is not on our agenda.  Qatar has used its vast wealth over the past decade to exert influence abroad, backing factions in civil wars and revolts across the Middle East. It infuriated Egypt's present rulers and Saudi Arabia by backing a Muslim Brotherhood government in Cairo that ruled for a year until it was deposed by the army in 2013. Qatar's state-funded satelite broadcaster Al Jazeera became hugely popular across the Middle East, but has long infuriated Arab governments used to exercising firm control over the media in their countries. Stop Interfering The demands, handed to Qatar by mediator Kuwait, tell Qatar to stop interfering in the four nations' domestic and foreign affairs and refrain from giving Qatari nationality to their citizens, the official from one of the sanctioning states said. They also include severing ties with the Muslim Brotherhood, Islamic State, al Qaeda, Hezbollah, and Jabhat Fateh al Sham, formerly al Qaeda's branch in Syria, and the surrender of all designated terrorists on Qatari territory. Qatar denies it has relationships with terrorist groups or shelters terrorists. It was also ordered to scale down its diplomatic relations with Iran, limit its commercial ties and expel members of Iran's Revolutionary Guards from its territory. Qatar denies they are there. The sanctioning countries demanded Qatar pay them reparations for any damage or costs incurred due to Qatari policies. Compliance with the demands would be monitored, with monthly reports in the first year, then every three months the next year, then annually for 10 years, the official said. Although Reuters was told about the contents of the ultimatum by an official from one of the sanctioning countries, UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash accused Qatar of leaking the demands. He said this  clearly reflects the depth of the crisis as a result of the damage caused by (Qatar’s) policies .  There is a price for the years of plotting and there is a price to return to the neighbourhood,  Gargash said on Twitter.  The leak (of demands) seeks to derail mediation.  Qataris who spoke to Reuters described the demands as unreasonable, particularly the closure of Jazeera, which millions of Arabs see as an important outlet for voices willing to challenge the region's authoritarian rulers, but which neighbouring governments call a conduit for Islamist propaganda.  Imagine another country demanding that CNN be closed,  40-year-old Haseeb Mansour, who works for telecom operator Ooredoo, said.  A Lot on the List  Abdullah al-Muhanadi, a retired public sector worker shopping for groceries in Doha on Friday morning, said the boycott must be lifted before negotiations to resolve the dispute could start.  There's a lot on the list that is simply not true or unreasonable, so how can we comply?  he said.  There are no IRGC (Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps) elements in Qatar and the agreement with Turkey is a long-standing diplomatic agreement so we cannot ask them to leave.  Qatar has only 300,000 citizens enjoying the riches produced by the world's largest exports of liquefied natural gas. The rest of its 2.7 million people are foreign migrant workers, mostly manual labourers employed on vast construction projects that have crowned the tiny desert peninsula with skyscrapers as well as stadiums for the 2022 soccer world cup. The sanctions have disrupted its main routes to import goods by land from Saudi Arabia and by sea from big container ships docked in the United Arab Emirates. But it so far has avoided economic collapse by quickly finding alternative routes, and it says its huge financial reserves will meet any challenges. Qatar says the sanctions have also brought personal hardship for its citizens who live in neighbouring countries or have relatives there. The countries that imposed the sanctions gave Qataris two weeks to leave, which expired on Monday.

Popular was taken over by Spain's largest bank Santander in early June for the symbolic price of one euro after European authorities stepped in to prevent its collapse. Popular's rescue wiped out shareholders, including retail investors, and some of them have already begun filing lawsuits to determine who was responsible.  This emphasises that there are contradicting versions in the comments made by different authorities of what has happened,  Javier Cremades, lawyer of the Spanish Association of Minority Shareholders, told Reuters. He said there was a need for the judiciary to act in order to clear up the facts. Spanish and European authorities said Spain's sixth biggest bank needed to be rescued because of its weak liquidity situation after a bank run. During a parliamentary hearing in mid-June, Spain's Economy Minister Luis de Guindos said that Popular ran out of liquidity, and was not in a position to ask for more, because it lacked collateral. But deputy governor of the Bank of Spain Javier Alonso said during a conference in Santander on Friday that the bank had had more collateral than was presented.  But, given it didn't present it, we haven't seen it and thus I can't certify it,  Alonso also said. The Bank of Spain's deputy governor also acknowledged that it would have been very complicated for Popular to present the last lines of collateral.  If you want to mobilise assets in other countries, you have to mobilise them in a way that is legally accessible to the Spanish central bank here (the provider of emergency liquidity), that is not a simple thing, it is not that easy,  he said. Asked by reporters if the Bank of Spain had not requested more collateral, he said:  How could you think that we didn't ask the lender?  Alonso said Popular's response to a request for further capital was:  Maybe tonight.  He also said that due to the run on the bank, any additional collateral might not have changed the outcome. The deputy governor said it was Banco Popular itself that said it was not viable due to stressed liquidity. Alonso did not want to establish a link between potential claims of shareholders and the liquidity situation of Banco Popular. He said that responsibilities would have to determined by legal authorities. (Reporting by Jesus Aguado; Editing by Paul E.

It's not that they're opposed. They'd like to get certain changes. And we'll see if we can take care of that,  Trump said in an interview with Fox News that aired on Friday, calling the group of conservative lawmakers  four very good people.  Trump earlier indicated changes may be in store for the proposal unveiled by Senate Republicans on Thursday to replace former President Barack Obama's signature healthcare law. The plan would scale back aid to the poor and kill a tax on the wealthy.  I am very supportive of the Senate #Healthcarebill. Look forward to making it really special!  Trump wrote on Twitter on Thursday. The Republican bill aims to deliver on one of Trump's central campaign promises to  repeal and replace  the 2010 law passed under Obama that expanded coverage to millions of Americans. Its fate remained uncertain after the four lawmakers refused to back the current Senate plan, leaving Republicans short of the votes needed for passage. Democrats are united in opposition to the proposal, which was worked out in secret by a group led Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Republicans view Obama's Affordable Care Act as a costly government intrusion into the private marketplace. The four Republican holdouts, among the Senate's most conservative members, said the plan did not go far enough in scaling back the federal government's role, highlighting Republicans' struggle to craft legislation to revamp a sector that accounts for one-sixth of the world's largest economy. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who has rejected the plan along with fellow Republican Senators Ted Cruz of Texas, Mike Lee of Utah and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, said fundamental problems still remain that would leave taxpayers subsidizing health insurance companies.  I want the bill to look more like a repeal bill,  Paul told MSNBC on Friday. The Senate measure maintains much of the structure of a House bill passed in May but differs in several key ways. If it passes, it would have to reconciled with the House version before Trump could sign it into law. While Republicans control both chambers of Congress and the White House, the party's efforts to unwind Obamacare has been dogged by internal conflicts between moderate and hard-line members of the party. Trump publicly celebrated the House bill's passage, only to criticize it in private as  mean.  This week he called for a health plan  with heart.  Democrats have sharply criticized both versions as a giveaway to the wealthy that would leave millions without health insurance. On Thursday, Obama weighed in on Facebook, writing:  If there’s a chance you might get sick, get old, or start a family – this bill will do you harm.  The Senate bill's real-world impact is not yet known, but the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office is expected to provide an estimate early next week. The CBO had found that the House bill would kick 23 million Americans off their health plans, making it unpopular with the public. Fewer than one in three Americans supports it, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling.

Experts on Islamist groups see no clear successor but regard Iyad al-Obaidi and Ayad al-Jumaili as the leading contenders, though neither would be likely to assume Baghdadi's title of  caliph  or overall commander of Muslims. Russia's defence ministry said last week Baghdadi may have been killed in an air strike in Syria and Interfax news agency quoted a senior Russian parliamentarian on Friday as saying the likelihood that he had been killed was close to 100 percent. But armed groups fighting in the region and U.S. officials say they have no evidence he is dead and many regional officials are sceptical about the reports of his death. Obaidi, who is in his 50s, has been serving as war minister. Jumaili, who is in his late 40s, is head of the group's Amniya security agency. In April Iraqi state TV said Jumaili had been killed, but that was not confirmed. Both joined the Sunni Salafist insurgency in Iraq in 2003, following the U.S.-led invasion which Saddam and empowered Iraq's Shi'ite majority. They have been Baghdadi's top aides since airstrikes in 2016 killed his then deputy Abu Ali al-Anbari, his Chechen war minister Abu Omar al-Shishani and his Syrian chief propagandist, Abu Mohammad al-Adnani.  Jumaili recognises Obaidi as his senior but there is no clear successor and, depending on conditions, it can be either of the two (who succeeds Baghdadi),  said Hisham al-Hashimi, who advises several Middle East governments on IS affairs. Baghdadi awarded himself the title of caliph -- the chief Muslim civil and religious ruler, regarded as the successor of the Prophet Mohammad -- in 2014. Obaidi or Jumaili would be unlikely to become caliph because they lack religious standing and Islamic State has lost much of its territory.  They don't belong to the Prophet Mohammed's lineage. The group has no longer 'a land to rule' or 'Ardh al-Tamkeen'. And none is well versed in Islamic theology,  said Fadhel Abu Ragheef, another Iraqi expert on the extremist group.  A caliph has to have an Ardh al-Tamkeen, which he rules in accordance with Islamic law. Failing that, the successor will just be recognised as the emir,  said Hashimi. Emir is Arabic for prince, and is a title that jihadists often use to describe their leaders. By contrast, Baghdadi, born as Ibrahim Awad al-Samarrai' in 1971, comes from a family of preachers and studied Islamic law in Baghdad. The appointment of the new leader would require the approval of an eight-member shoura council, an advisory body to the caliph. Nut its members would be unlikely to meet for security reasons so would make their opinion known through couriers. Six members of the council are Iraqis, one Jordanian and one Saudi, and all are veterans of the Sunni salafist insurgency. A ninth member, a Bahraini, was killed in an air strike in late May.

Peter Hook, the bass player from Manchester bands Joy Division and New Order, led the crowd on the main Pyramid Stage in reflecting on  our hopes and our prayers for life, love and freedom, the things we are here to celebrate .  Glasto , as it is affectionately known, is headlined later on Friday by Radiohead who 20 years ago performed during one of the wettest years in the festival's history, lifting a sodden crowd with music from their groundbreaking album  OK Computer . Featuring songs about alienation, capitalism and the impact of modern technology,  OK Computer  sounds oddly prescient in a politically divided and anxious Britain in 2017. Security has been stepped up at Worthy Farm in Somerset, south-west England, after a suicide bombing at an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester killed 22 last month and three recent attacks in London. Festival-goers took the extra checks in their stride, more concerned about coping with the hottest June for four decades which slowed activity on site to a crawl. Temperatures cooled on Friday, the first day of music in which the standout is English band Radiohead in a third headline appearance.  I am loving the weather. It's perfect Glasto weather,  said 23-year-old Laura Cottam in the Hacienda Classical crowd. She said she spent Wednesday looking for shade and cold beer after arriving as soon as the gates opened. An unlikely marriage between DJs Graeme Park and Mike Pickering and Manchester Camerata Orchestra, Hacienda Classical entertained with floor-fillers from the 80s and 90s, including Ultra Nate's  Free  and New Order's  Blue Monday . The afternoon line-up on the biggest of more than 12 stages includes 81-year Kris Kristofferson, rock duo Royal Blood, which only formed in 2013, and the English indie band, the xx, before the highly anticipated return of Radiohead. Fans expected  OK Computer  to feature heavily in the set list on Friday, the same day as a re-release of the album with tracks that did not make the cut 20 years ago, called  OK Computer OKNOTOK 1997 2017 .

Health stocks had rallied on Thursday after Senate Republicans unveiled legislation that would replace Obamacare. However, the bill faced skepticism from the Democrats, who attacked the legislation as a callous giveaway to the rich that would leave millions without coverage. UnitedHealth was down about 1 percent and was the biggest drag on the Dow. Other major health stocks, including Regeneron and Amgen, were down between 1 percent and 3 percent. At 9:48 a.m. ET (1348 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 46.92 points, or 0.22 percent, at 21,350.37, the S&P; 500 was down 2.2 points, or 0.09 percent, at 2,432.3. The Nasdaq Composite index  was down 15.74 points, or 0.25 percent, at 6,220.94. Investors also awaited economic data and speeches by Federal Reserve policymakers for clues on interest rate hikes amid concerns over oil prices. Crude oil prices bounced off this week's 10-month lows, but were still set for their worst first-half performance in almost two decades. Sliding oil prices have added to concerns on the inflation outlook, which along with a flattening yield curve, could pose a challenge to the Fed in deciding whether the economy was ready for another interest rate hike this year.  There is a concern that economy maybe struggling slightly, with oil prices hitting lows,  said Andre Bakhos, managing director at Janlyn Capital in Bernardsville, New Jersey.  If it's a supply problem, it's wonderful for the market,  he said.  If it is demand that is starting to wane, then it's going to create more questions than give us answers.  At current levels, the S&P; 500 energy index, down 15 percent so far this year, is on track to post its worst weekly decline in about 18 months. Four of the 11 major S&P; sectors were lower, with the S&P; 500 consumer discretionary sector's 0.37 percent fall leading the decliners. Shares of Bank of America, JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs were up marginally following the Fed's stress test results on Thursday. The results showed that 34 largest U.S. banks have all cleared the first stage, implying they would be able to maintain enough capital in an extreme recession. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, Cleveland Fed chief Loretta Mester and Fed governor Jerome Powell are all scheduled to make appearances later in the day. Economic data due includes new U.S. single family home sales for May at 10:00 a.m. ET. The reading is expected to show that single family home sales likely grew 5.4 percent. Caterpillar was off 0.74 percent, following a Deutsche Bank downgrade to  hold . U.S.-listed shares of Blackberry were down 10.6 percent at $9.88 after the company's quarterly revenue missed analysts' estimate. Bed Bath & Beyond was down 10.4 percent after the home furnishing retailer reported a bigger-than-expected fall in same-store sales in the first quarter. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,307 to 1,195. On the Nasdaq, 1,317 issues fell.

Founded in 1915, Naspers has transformed itself from an apartheid-era newspaper publisher into a $85 billion multinational with private equity-style investments e-commerce platforms such as auction sites, online retail and e-classifieds. But it owes much of that valuation to its 33 percent Tencent stake, which is worth about $114 billion rand, or 20 percent more than Naspers itself. The discount has prompted some investors to urge Chief Executive Bob van Dyk to find ways to narrow it. Naspers, South Africa's biggest company by market value, said core headline earnings totalled $1.8 billion, or 406 cents per share, compared with $1.2 billion, or 298 cents per share, a year earlier. Core headline EPS is Naspers' main profit measure that strips out non-operational and one-off items. Naspers said its e-commerce division, which excludes Tencent and houses assets such as OLX, the biggest classifieds sites in India and Brazil, widened losses to $682 million from $648 million.  During the 2018 financial year the group will keep scaling its commerce businesses to drive profitability and cash generation,  the company said. Naspers has ploughed around $4 billion since 2012 into the business to drive growth mainly in e-commerce platforms and reduce its dependence on Tencent and pay-TV, which thrives in South Africa but faces headwinds elsewhere.

The works on display included a 16th century marble bust believed to be of Sappho, the ancient Greek writer who wrote passionate love poems to other women, to a 17th century portrait of a bearded woman by Spanish artist Juan Sanchez.  It isn't erotic, that isn't necessary. It is an historical reflection,  Carlos Navarro, one of the exhibition's curators, told Reuters. WorldPride, a festival promoting the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, takes place every few years in a different international city. It is expected to draw up to three million visitors to Madrid between June 23 and July 2. One of the jewels of the selection is a little-known early 19th century ink drawing by one of Spain's most important artists, Francisco de Goya, of a grimacing man dressed in women's clothes with his skirt hitched up and his stockings around his ankles. The drawing bears the handwritten title  El Maricon de la Tia Gila  or  Aunt Gila's Queer . When Goya was not painting commissioned portraits for the royal family, he made etchings depicting ordinary people in Spanish villages in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.  Goya is not using that name in an homophobic way, he's showing that all these people have a place in our society,  said Alvaro Perdices, another curator. The exhibition,  The Other's Gaze.

British Airways' mixed fleet cabin crew - those who work on both long and short-haul flights - are set to go on strike for two weeks from July 1 over sanctions on union members involved in previous industrial action in a long-running dispute about pay. A document dated June 21 showed that the airline had applied to Britain's Civil Aviation Authority to use nine Qatar registered Airbus A320 or A321s between July 1 and July 16.  The application has been made on the grounds that the lease is justified on the basis of exceptional needs ... to enable British Airways to continue passenger operations in light of planned operational disruption by its mixed fleet cabin crew,  a CAA document said. A  wet-leasing  deal would mean that BA pays Qatar to use its aircraft and crew for the two week period. The deal could help Qatar to make more use of its planes after its operations were disrupted by a boycott from four Arab nations, forcing it to seek out other destinations on which to use its planes. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut ties with Qatar on June 5 in the worst diplomatic crisis in the region in years. There are already close ties between Qatar Airways and British Airways. Both are partners in the OneWorld alliance and code share on certain flights, while the Doha-based carrier owns a 20 percent stake in BA parent International Airlines Group . British Airways said when the strike was announced that it would fly all customers to their destinations during the strike action, as it has done during previous strikes.  Our priority is to fly all our customers to their destinations. We are looking at a range of options and are speaking with a number of airlines,  a spokeswoman for British airways said.  We will publish our contingency plans in the coming days for customers who have bookings on the days of threatened industrial action.​  (Reporting by Alistair Smout and Victoria Bryan; Editing by Alison Williams)","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/iag-britishairways-strike-idUSL8N1JK33J"},

Auctions of central bank funds in return for collateral such as bonds took place in 2007 and 2008 during a crisis that ultimately forced taxpayers to bail out lenders such as Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds.  The focus of the investigation was whether assistance had been provided to certain financial institutions to enable them to bid successfully for the available funding, to the possible detriment of other institutions,  the SFO said on Friday.  After a thorough investigation the SFO has concluded that there is no evidence of criminality in relation to this matter.  The SFO said it has now closed its investigation. The BoE said the events under investigation occurred nearly a decade ago at a time when a number of Britain's large financial institutions were under unprecedented stress. The financial crisis exposed shortcomings in the BoE's frameworks for providing liquidity insurance, operating procedures and governance arrangements, the Bank said in a statement. After the SFO's decision to open an investigatation, the Bank's Court of Directors commissioned a  rigorous and comprehensive  review of other key market operations during the financial crisis.  The review resulted in a number of recommendations, which the Bank has now implemented,  the BoE said, adding that details of the review were published on Friday.

The announcement, which comes after the country's human rights watchdog, spoke of  inhuman living conditions  facing migrants, indicates newly-elected President Emmanuel Macron wants to show he is tough on security and will not backtrack on the eviction of thousands of migrants last November.  We can't set up another reception center in Calais because it would reproduce what happened before; you go from a few hundred to a few thousand migrants,  Interior Minister Gerard Collomb told reporters on a visit to Calais.  It's an issue that must be dealt with but not only in Calais.  For most migrants, Calais is the last stop before an attempt to cross the short sea stretch to Britain. It has become a symbol of Europe's troubles dealing with the influx of people fleeing war and poverty in countries such as Afghanistan, Iran, Syria and Eritrea.  Collomb said he would send two extra squadrons of riot police to the zone and had been asked by Macron to produce a plan within two weeks on how to better manage the situation.  That, government spokesman Christophe Castaner said, would focus on speeding up the time taken to process asylum requests and filter out people who will be sent back to their country of origin if they fail to qualify as war refugees. Collomb rejected calls from local humanitarian organizations for a new center to handle a resurgence of migrant arrivals in a city where makeshift camp dubbed The Jungle was demolished last November. The vast, squalid sprawl of shanty-town shelters housed about 7,000 migrants, many of whom were taken to temporary lodgings in villages and towns across France pending examination of asylum requests.  We don't want to create a gathering point where numbers would swell back up to 7,000 over time. That would not be tolerable, for the migrants, the residents of Calais and for economic life,  Collomb said. Aid agencies say about 400-600 migrants are once again gathered and sleeping rough on streets. France's human rights watchdog said in a statement this month that migrants in Calais were living in  inhuman living  conditions  and that its officials had found evidence of  unprecedented  rights violations after interviewing migrants. In one industrial zone, an Afghan who said he arrived a month ago, told Reuters on Friday that conditions were dire.  We want to go to Great Britain, will go,  said Ahmed, who only gave his first name and said he was 26 years old.  We were treated better in the other countries we crossed. Here it's no water, no shower,  he said. Charities had warned the previous, Socialist government  that migrants would return despite the shutdown of The Jungle. Many migrants try to get to Britain by slipping secretively inside the cargo holds of large trucks bound for English shores. A van driver died this week when he drove into a queue of trucks whose path was blocked by tree trunks. Several Eritrean migrants were arrested.

The annual inflation rate cooled to 1.3 percent in May, below forecasts for 1.5 percent, pushing it further away from the Bank of Canada's 2 percent target as the cost of food fell and gasoline prices moderated, data from Statistics Canada showed.                  The central bank's three measures of core inflation remained subdued.      It is going to be very difficult for the Bank (of Canada) to hike as soon as next month when you still haven't carved out a bottom on inflation,  said Derek Holt, head of capital markets economics at Scotiabank.     Chances of a hike in July fell to just 20 percent from one-in-three before the inflation report, data from the overnight index swaps market showed.                The Bank of Canada's top two officials last week said that looser monetary policies put in place in 2015 had largely done their work, and the bank would assess whether rates must remain at near-record lows.                  At 9:13 a.m. ET (1313 GMT), the Canadian dollar          was trading at C$1.3305 to the greenback, or 75.16 U.S. cents, down 0.5 percent.     The currency traded in a range of C$1.3211 to C$1.3307.     Canadian government bond prices were higher across much of a steeper yield curve, with the two-year            price up 4.5 Canadian cents to yield 0.911 percent and the 10-year             rising 10 Canadian cents to yield 1.489 percent.     The two-year yield fell 3 basis points further below its U.S. equivalent to a spread of -43.8 basis points, as Canadian bonds outperformed. On Thursday, the spread had touched its narrowest in nearly four months at -40.8 basis points.

Kinshasa has been fighting insurgents in the Kasai region since August, triggering fears of a wider conflict in the large central African country, a tinderbox of ethnic rivalry and competing claims over mineral resources. Congo's Catholic church said this week the violence had killed more than 3,300 people since October, with both government forces and the militia responsible for hundreds of deaths. The U.N.'s Human Rights Council, composed of 47 member states, adopted by consensus the resolution calling for an investigation, brought by African countries. Congo's Ambassador Zénon Mukongo Ngay, addressing the Council, said President Joseph Kabila's government would cooperate to shed light on atrocities. But the Congolese justice system would be in charge of the joint investigations, with the U.N. providing  technical or logistical support , he said. U.N. rights chief Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, who is to name fact-finding experts to the investigation, had called repeatedly for an international inquiry into events in Kasai, an opposition stronghold.  We fully support the establishment of an international investigation ...as a step forward in identifying the perpetrators of gross violations and bringing them to justice,  Zeid said in a statement. His office counted on the  full cooperation  of the government and on the experts having unfettered access to all sites, files, people and places.  The team will conduct investigations in a fully independent manner, in accordance with international standards,  he said. Zeid told the Council on Tuesday that a militia linked to the government has committed a string of ethnically-motivated attacks in recent months, including cutting off toddlers' limbs and stabbing pregnant women. [L8N1JH32Z] Kinshasa has repeatedly denied that security forces systematically use excessive force and insists it is capable of conducting its own investigations. Several government officials have said in recent days that they were pleased a European Union proposal for a fully-independent international investigation into the violence had been withdrawn. But diplomats said elements of that had been incorporated into the African text. In a statement to the council, Jason Mack, a representative from the U.S. delegation, said Washington welcomed the resolution but retained doubts about the Congolese government's commitment to a transparent investigation. Paul Nsapu, the deputy secretary-general of the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH), a French NGO, said investigators might not have sufficient authority to identify perpetrators of  rights abuses.   This resolution risks not being enough to stop the massacres,  he said.   Human Rights Watch's Leila Matar, however, said in a statement that the inquiry  brings hope of uncovering the truth about the horrific violence . editing by Richard Balmforth and John Stonestreet","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-congo-violence-un-idUSKBN19E162"},

The Philippines accepted the offer of two AP-3C Orion aircraft for reconnaissance to pinpoint locations of Maute group fighters holed up for a fifth week in Marawi, a town the rebels have declared as their own Islamic territory.  The regional threat from terrorism, in particular from Daesh and foreign fighters, is a direct threat to Australia and our interests,  Australian Defense Minister Marise Payne said in a statement, referring to Islamic State by an Arabic acronym. Australia's help comes as fears grow that the Maute and its affiliates have much stronger designs on parts of the southern Philippines than previously imagined, evidenced by their preparations and combat capability during the weeks of fighting. The threat is heightened by losses suffered by Islamic State in Syria and Iraq, and intelligence reports that it is building alliances and seeking new pastures from which to project its agenda. Gilbert Gapay, an Philippine military spokesman, said the  surveillance planes would help tackle extremism across Mindanao, an island of 22 million people, where separatists, pirates and kidnap gangs have thrived for decades.  He said the battle for Marawi was not a failure because the military had learned a lot and was stopping Islamic State from taking root.  This gives us a picture of the expanse of their network,  Gapay told reporters.  They won't thrive anymore in our country.  But security experts say the battle has exposed intelligence and operational failures by the Philippines and its limited cooperation with neighboring Malaysia and Indonesia to stop extremism from spreading. The three countries on Thursday agreed on joint measures to pool information and try to stem recruitment, movement and financing of fighters. The Philippines says it knows of 40 foreign operatives in the country. An OV-10 aircraft release a rocket during an airstrike against the so-called Maute group, who have taken over large parts of Marawi city.Romeo Ranoco'Last Stand' Australia's support follows that of Philippine defense treaty ally the United States, which has provided technical help through military surveillance and communications experts stationed in Zamboanga city on Mindanao.  The Philippines has welcomed foreign support amid operations that have had mixed results, with 67 security forces killed as rebels withstand a fifth week of ground assaults and air strikes, one of which saw 10 government troops killed on June 1 when a bomb missed its target. Philippine troops, more adept at fighting in jungles and mountains, have found unfamiliar territory in the urban warfare that has devastated much of Marawi and displaced nearly 250,000 people. Slideshow (2 Images)Some 300 civilians were believed to be either trapped or being used as human shields, according to the army. Civilians involved in relief efforts believe the number could be higher. Planes dropped more bombs early on Friday and the army tried to flush out the estimated 90-100 rebels with artillery and heavy gunfire. Efforts were being slowed by roadside bombs, snipers and booby-trapped vehicles and gas tanks.  This is already their last stand and they are getting desperate,  Jo-Ar Herrera, a military spokesman, told reporters.  Our mission is to neutralize them so that they will no longer threaten other parts of the Philippines.  Residents who fled militant-held areas say the black-clad Maute militia are in the fight for the long haul and are trying to cement their presence as an arm of Islamic State.   They patrol the streets on foot and on vehicles, which they spray with black paint and have mounted big guns,  said Norodin Garangan, 44, who escaped on Wednesday.  I know there are still people in our area but they're afraid to go out.

The announcement, which comes after the country's human rights watchdog, spoke of  inhuman living conditions  facing migrants, indicates newly-elected President Emmanuel Macron wants to show he is tough on security and will not backtrack on the eviction of thousands of migrants last November.  We can't set up another reception center in Calais because it would reproduce what happened before; you go from a few hundred to a few thousand migrants,  Interior Minister Gerard Collomb told reporters on a visit to Calais.  It's an issue that must be dealt with but not only in Calais.  For most migrants, Calais is the last stop before an attempt to cross the short sea stretch to Britain. It has become a symbol of Europe's troubles dealing with the influx of people fleeing war and poverty in countries such as Afghanistan, Iran, Syria and Eritrea.  Collomb said he would send two extra squadrons of riot police to the zone and had been asked by Macron to produce a plan within two weeks on how to better manage the situation.  That, government spokesman Christophe Castaner said, would focus on speeding up the time taken to process asylum requests and filter out people who will be sent back to their country of origin if they fail to qualify as war refugees. Collomb rejected calls from local humanitarian organizations for a new center to handle a resurgence of migrant arrivals in a city where makeshift camp dubbed The Jungle was demolished last November. The vast, squalid sprawl of shanty-town shelters housed about 7,000 migrants, many of whom were taken to temporary lodgings in villages and towns across France pending examination of asylum requests.  We don't want to create a gathering point where numbers would swell back up to 7,000 over time. That would not be tolerable, for the migrants, the residents of Calais and for economic life,  Collomb said. Aid agencies say about 400-600 migrants are once again gathered and sleeping rough on streets. France's human rights watchdog said in a statement this month that migrants in Calais were living in  inhuman living  conditions  and that its officials had found evidence of  unprecedented  rights violations after interviewing migrants. In one industrial zone, an Afghan who said he arrived a month ago, told Reuters on Friday that conditions were dire.  We want to go to Great Britain, will go,  said Ahmed, who only gave his first name and said he was 26 years old.  We were treated better in the other countries we crossed. Here it's no water, no shower,  he said. Charities had warned the previous, Socialist government  that migrants would return despite the shutdown of The Jungle. Many migrants try to get to Britain by slipping secretively inside the cargo holds of large trucks bound for English shores. A van driver died this week when he drove into a queue of trucks whose path was blocked by tree trunks. Several Eritrean migrants were arrested.

Spot gold        was up 0.6 percent at $1,257.1 an ounce at 1320 GMT after earlier touching a session high at $1,258.81. U.S. gold futures         rose 0.7 percent to $1,257.9. However, gold is little changed from last week.      The broad story is the tug of war between the Fed, which seems determined to push on with monetary tightening and reducing its balance sheet and political uncertainty,  said Danske Bank analyst Jens Pederson.     Allegations of ties to Russia have cast a shadow over U.S. President Donald Trump's first five months in office, North Korea testing a rocket engine and Brexit negotiations are all fuelling concern about global stability.      Political noise out of Washington regarding Trump's ties with Russia is unlikely to provide lasting support to gold while an escalation of the geopolitical tensions with North Korea is a bullish wild card,  Julius Baer analysts said in a note.      Facing higher interest rates and a stronger dollar, we still see gold prices weakening towards $1,200 per ounce over the coming months.      Gold is often used by investors as a hedge against political and financial uncertainty. But it doesn't earn interest, dividends or coupons and it costs money to insure and store.     A rising U.S. currency makes dollar-denominated metals more expensive for holders of other currencies, which potentially could subdue demand.            The Fed's rate rise on June 14 saw investors sell gold.  Holdings of the largest gold-backed exchange-traded-fund (ETF), New York's SPDR Gold Trust      , have fallen to 27.456 million ounces from 27.875 million ounces on June 13.                     On the technical side, the first upside barrier comes in around $1,260 near the 55-day moving average. That is followed by the 21-day moving average at around $1,264, while the 100-day moving average at $1,249 provides strong support.     Elsewhere, silver        gained 1.1 percent to $16.71 an ounce, platinum        climbed 0.3 percent to $924.2 an ounce and palladium rose 0.8 percent to $877.2.

The transaction is the second benchmark issue following Cyprus's exit from its EU and IMF bailout programme in March 2016. With existing cash buffers estimated at around 8% of GDP and covering financing needs until 2Q18, the transaction was launched for debt management reasons and to allow Cyprus to benefit from favourable market conditions and low interest rates. The seven-year bond was priced to yield 2.8%, the lowest-ever rate achieved by Cyprus for a euro benchmark bond, despite the fact that Cyprus is not included in the European Central Bank's public sector purchase programme. It was offered in conjunction with a simultaneous exchange for three outstanding bonds maturing between June 2019 and May 2020. The transaction reduces medium-term refinancing risks by lengthening the sovereign's debt maturity profile and reducing 2019 and 2020 refinancing needs. Of the EUR846 million in net proceeds, EUR560 million has been used to exchange the 2019 and 2020 maturities, and EUR280 million is earmarked for prepayment of a portion of Cyprus's IMF loans. This will move Cyprus's next debt amortisation peak of around EUR1.5 billion to 2025 from 2019, and the percentage of public debt maturing over the next five years to 34% from 38%. The IMF prepayment will also help reduce debt service costs by locking in the bond's lower rate against the IMF's 3.52% floating-rate loan, and will bring the outstanding amount owed to the IMF down to around EUR720 million. A sustained track record of market access at affordable rates is one of several factors that could lead to an upgrade of Cyprus's 'BB-'/Positive sovereign rating, which Fitch affirmed on 21 April. The Positive Outlook reflects how Cyprus's continuing economic recovery is underpinning the financial sector, and fiscal and economic adjustment following the 2013 banking crisis and bailout. The economic recovery is supported by improving household consumption in line with a fall in unemployment, and strong tourist inflows. GDP growth of 3.3% yoy in 1Q17 continued to be broad-based. We project GDP growth of 2.9% in 2017 and 2.5% in 2018. However, some factors continue to weigh on Cyprus's sovereign credit profile. The banking sector's exceptionally weak asset quality poses a significant downside risk to economic recovery. The ratio of the sector's non-performing exposures to total loans was 46% at end-February 2017, the highest of Fitch-rated sovereigns. At over 100% of GDP, gross general government debt (GGGD) is more than double the 'BB' category median, and net external debt at over 140% of GDP is far higher than the 'BB' median of around 20%. This limits the private and public sectors' abilities to finance economic activity and deal with shocks. We expect the cyclical recovery to support small fiscal surpluses in 2017 and 2018, leading to a decline in the GGGD/GDP ratio to around 100% by 2018. But risks to the fiscal outlook are tilted to the downside, as presidential elections and the expiration of wage settlements in 2018 could lead to fiscal relaxation. These factors are reflected in our rating sensitivities. As well as sustained market access, developments that could lead to an upgrade include a marked improvement in banking sector asset quality, further economic recovery and a reduction in private sector indebtedness, a lower government debt/GDP ratio, and a narrowing of the current account deficit and reduction in external indebtedness.

The yield curve between five-year notes and 30-year hit its flattest levels in almost 10 years as oil prices declined and concerns lingered over last week’s weaker-than-expected Consumer Price Index report.     “For the third month in a row, (CPI) was way below expectations,” said Jim Vogel, an interest rate strategist at FTN Financial in Memphis, Tennessee. Continued declines in non-seasonally adjusted consumer prices played a large role in the move, he added.     A decline in oil prices despite positive fundamentals added to concerns, Vogel said.     The yield curve                was last at 97 basis points after flattening to 95 basis points on Thursday, the lowest since December 2007.     Benchmark 10-year notes             were down 4/32 in price to yield 2.17 percent, up from 2.15 percent on late Thursday.     Fed officials including New York Fed President William Dudley and Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren both took a hawkish tone this week on monetary policy, noting that pausing the tightening cycle could pose risks to the economy.     Expectations that the Fed will continue on its tightening course has weighed on short- and intermediate-dated notes, which are the most sensitive to central bank's policy, even as longer-dated debt rallied.     Federal Reserve Board Governor Jerome Powell, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard and Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester are all due to speak on Friday.     The Fed has emphasized the improving job market and an expectation that inflation will return to targets despite recent declines.     The next major economic release, June’s employment report on July 7, will be watched for signs of further improvement in the labor force.     “If the Fed is going to continue to watch the employment rate while everyone else watches inflation, the Fed’s probably not going to veer off its course,” said Vogel.

The annual inflation rate declined to 1.3 percent from April's 1.6 percent, Statistics Canada said on Friday, the lowest level since November 2016 and below forecasts for 1.5 percent. The three measures of core inflation the Bank of Canada set last year remained subdued, with two of them declining. Economists said the figures give the central bank room to hold off on raising interest rates at its next meeting in July after hawkish comments from two top policymakers last week set the stage for hikes sooner than had been anticipated.  When we're looking for reasons for the bank to take its time in raising rates, core inflation has been exhibit A,  said Doug Porter, chief economist at Bank of Montreal.  Certainly very modest core inflation continues to rumble in the background as a pretty strong reason for the bank not to rush the proceedings. That story was just pounded home today.  The Canadian dollar weakened against the greenback, while markets reduced the likelihood of a July hike to 22 percent from 34.8 percent before the report was released. Nonetheless, a hike by the end of the year is nearly fully priced in, suggesting markets do not expect weak inflation to delay the bank for long. The bank, which has an inflation target of 2 percent, has held rates at 0.50 percent since 2015 when it cut borrowing costs twice to offset the hit from cheaper oil. CPI common, which the central bank says is the best gauge of the economy's underperformance, held at 1.3 percent. CPI median, which shows the median inflation rate across CPI components, declined to 1.5 percent, while CPI trim, which excludes upside and downside outliers, dipped to 1.2 percent. Food prices fell on an annual basis for the eighth month in a row, down 0.1 percent as consumers paid less for meat and fresh fruit. Still, food price declines have been moderating in recent months and the cost of fresh vegetables rose for the first time since August 2016. Gasoline prices were up 6.8 percent, slowing significantly from April's 15.9 percent annual increase.

Horton Inc had sweetened its offer to buy a 75 percent stake in the real estate developer, escalating a bidding war with investment firm Starwood Capital Group. Forestar said D.R. Horton's new cash offer of $17.75 per Forestar share — up from $16.25 per share previously — was superior to a proposal from Starwood to buy all of Forestar. D.R. Horton's new offer values 75 percent of Forestar at about $565 million, according to Reuters calculations. Texas-based Forestar agreed in April to be acquired by Starwood for $14.25 per share. Starwood increased that offer to $15.50 per Forestar share earlier this week and to $16.00 per share on Friday. The bids for Forestar come at a time when U.S. homebuilders including D.R. Horton are seeking ways to boost their land holding as rising land acquisition costs and a tight labor market hamper efforts to tap the recovery in the housing market. Forestar, which mainly develops lots and sells them to homebuilders, owns interests in 50 residential and mixed-use projects comprising 4,600 acres of real estate. Forestar said on Friday its board had informed Starwood that it intends to terminate their merger agreement and sign a deal with D.R. Horton under the homebuilder's sweetened offer. Forestar's shares were up 4.8 percent at $17.30 in premarket trading.

No list of names was immediately available, but the prisoners to be released include 25 women and  a large number of youth jailed in cases involving protesting and gathering,  state news agency MENA reported, without specifying how many. Since seizing power in mid-2013 from the Muslim Brotherhood, Sisi has presided over a crackdown on Islamist opponents that has seen hundreds killed and many thousands jailed. Activists and liberal opponents have also been imprisoned. A law requiring permission from the Interior Ministry for any public gathering of more than 10 people is strictly enforced and has largely succeeded in ending the kind of mass demonstrations that helped unseat two presidents in three years. Security sources said that among those pardoned was Hesham Talaat Moustafa, the former chairman of one of Egypt's largest real estate developers, Talaat Mostafa Group. Moustafa had been sentenced to 15 years in prison for hiring a hitman to kill Lebanese pop star Suzanne Tamim in 2008. He was pardoned on health concerns, the security sources said. Sisi ordered the interior ministry to implement the decision before the start of the holiday, which immediately follows the holy month of Ramadan that ends this Saturday.

Typically new issuance slows during summer in the leveraged loan market, but bankers report the pipeline for new M&A; has been increasing. “It’s getting stronger with big deals,” said a senior investment banker, who cited several deals with financing of more than US$2bn in the works and the potential for a deal as large as US$10bn. There are already US$11.7bn of LBO commitments on the calendar, according to data from Thomson Reuters LPC. That includes the financing for the acquisitions of customer contact and conferencing service provider West Corp and Sealed Air Corp’s cleaning and chemicals systems unit Diversey. That volume does not include the financing for private equity firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice’s US$2.5bn buyout of HD Supply Holding Inc’s Waterworks business unit, which was announced June 6. Barclays, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan and Royal Bank of Canada provided commitments for the Waterworks deal. Credit Suisse and Goldman Sachs are leading a US$1.8bn term loan to back Diversey’s US$3.2bn buyout by private equity firm Bain Capital. Credit Suisse is also leading a US$2.7bn term loan supporting West Corp’s buyout by private equity firm Apollo Global Management. Never Enough Still, this is not nearly enough to meet the powerful demand for this floating rate asset class, especially from investors tired of seeing the loans they are already holding reprice lower as a strong secondary market has allowed issuers to do regularly this year. “The market is starved for new LBO paper,” the banker said. Part of the problem is the amount of demand for leveraged loans, especially for loans backing acquisitions. Loan funds have seen inflows every week this year, except for one. Collateralized Loan Obligation creation is on track for more than US$80bn this year after some estimates put the earlier total at around US$50bn. In addition, money from overseas including Japan and the Middle East in the form of separately managed accounts remains strong, bankers said. All this adds up to too much demand and too little supply even though LBO volume is not quite as dire as some investors make it out. Completed LBO activity in the second quarter now totals US$24.7bn after volume hit US$23.1bn during the first quarter. This number would be the sixth-highest total since the fourth quarter of 2007. LBO volume tallied US$29.9bn during the fourth quarter of 2016, the highest since the second quarter of 2014. Part of the problem hindering more LBO activity is that valuations are high and sponsors are limited in the amount of debt they can place on companies due to the federal government’s Leveraged Lending Guidance, which were implemented in 2013 to limit leverage. “Even with low interest rates, it is hard to make those numbers work,” said a lender. However, the deals that have been pushed through signify that private equity firms are finding ways to get deals done, said the banker, often through writing larger equity checks. “The big machines are just shifting to a new paradigm where until valuations come down they are just making less money,” the banker said.

At the same time, the agency has affirmed Allianz's main subsidiaries' IFS Ratings at 'AA'. The Outlooks are Stable. A full list of rating actions is at the end of this commentary. KEY RATING DRIVERS The affirmation reflects the Allianz's very strong consolidated group capital position, strong technical profitability, broad diversification by geography and product, and a solid business position in the company's key markets. In addition, the ratings also benefit from the sound credit quality of the group's investment mix. Partially offsetting these rating strengths are the currently suppressed profitability at its asset management subsidiary, PIMCO, and a challenging medium-term outlook for some of Allianz's life markets. Allianz scores  Very Strong  in Fitch's Prism factor-based capital model (FBM) based on end-2016 data, which supports the ratings. The group's core capitalisation remained strong at end-2016 with shareholders' funds of EUR67.3 billion (end-2016: EUR63.1 billion) and Solvency II capitalisation of 218% (end-2015: 200%). Financial leverage, as calculated by Fitch, was 21% at end-2016, unchanged from end-2015. For 2016 Allianz reported a stable operating result of EUR10.8 billion (2015: EUR10.7 billion) with strong contributions from all three divisions. The combined ratio remained strong at 94.4% (94.6%) and net profit was up 3.8% at EUR7.3 billion. In the current low-investment yield environment, Allianz benefits from its strong non-life business. Unlike in life insurance, low investment yields are partly compensated by greater underwriting discipline and better technical results. At PIMCO, new business development has stabilised, after three years of net asset outflows. In 1Q17 PIMCO reported a net inflow of EUR21 billion in third-party assets under management. Third-party assets under management in the whole division grew EUR42 billion to EUR1,403 billion in 1Q17. This suggests PIMCO's franchise has not been permanently damaged by the recent shake-up in senior management and that Allianz is likely to retain its strong position in asset management. Allianz is one of the largest insurance groups in Europe. IFRS gross written premiums were EUR76 billion and total assets stood at EUR884 billion at end-2016. The group is active in both the non-life and life/health businesses as well as in asset management and has a strong business position and franchise. RATING SENSITIVITIES Key rating triggers that could lead to a downgrade include deterioration of Allianz's capital position, with its Prism FBM score falling below 'Very Strong' for a sustained period or a sustained decline in profitability with a net return on equity below 9% (2016: 11%). An upgrade is viewed as unlikely by Fitch over the medium term unless the group sees a sustained, significant increase in the Prism FBM score to 'Extremely Strong', a decline of  financial leverage to below 15%, and sustained, sharp improvement in profitability with a return on equity consistently above 15%.

At least two soldiers shot long firearms through the fence from a distance of just a few feet at protesters who were throwing rocks, television footage showed. One man collapsed to the ground and was carried off by other protesters. Paramedics took at least two other injured people to a hospital, a Reuters witness said.  The sergeant used an unauthorized weapon to repel the attack, causing the death of one of assailants,  Interior minister Nestor Reverol said on Twitter. He said the air force police sergeant faced legal proceedings. Hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans have taken to the streets in recent months to protest against a clampdown on the opposition, shortages of food and medicine, and President Nicolas Maduro's plan to overhaul the constitution. The reaction of the security forces to provocation at marches has been in the spotlight since images showed a national guard member pointing a pistol at demonstrators on Monday, prompting the opposition to intensify its street campaign. The protesters who attacked the fence outside La Carlota airbase in the wealthy east of Caracas had earlier burned a truck and a motorbike when security forces firing rubber bullets broke up a march destined for the attorney general's office.   David Jose Vallenilla, 22, died after arriving at a hospital in the Chacao municipality where the protest happened. Shots, Petrol Bombs A small group of protesters throwing petrol bombs from behind flimsy homemade shields cheered when powerful fireworks used as weapons landed near troops in the airbase. They managed to rip down a section of the fence surrounding the base, despite volleys of tear gas and rubber bullets. Riot security forces members congregate next to a government truck that was set on fire during a rally against Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's government in Caracas, Venezuela. The graffiti reads  Maduro killer .Christian VeronAt least one soldier aimed a shotgun through the fence, Reuters pictures showed. The national guard uses shotgun cartridges filled with small rubber pellets against protests.     Reverol said two soldiers were seriously injured by  explosives  the protesters launched, and said shots and petrol bombs hit a primary school on the base during the attack.  Opposition lawmaker Jose Manuel Olivares said Vallenilla had been killed by the national guard firing rubber bullets at point blank range. Olivares, whose arm was wounded in the protest, called for sit-ins on highways on Friday and protests at military bases on Saturday. Slideshow (18 Images)Vallenilla suffered wounds to the lungs and heart, a doctor who attended him told Reuters. The attorney general's office said he was shot three times. Maduro says the violence is part of a foreign-led plot to overthrow his government and criticizes the opposition for fanning it, however authorities have taken action against three national guard sergeants accused of killing a boy on Monday. Venezuela's national guard is a wing of the military charged with internal public order. It mainly uses tear gas, water cannons and rubber bullets to control protests that frequently escalate into riots.  On Monday, a teenager died during another protest in the same area after footage showed a national guard soldier pointing a pistol at protesters. Maduro moved the head of the national guard to a new position looking after security in the capital after that incident, part of a reshuffle that brought several more military figures into his cabinet.    I have ordered an investigation to see if there was a conspiracy behind this,  Maduro said earlier on Thursday. He said the men involved in Monday's shooting had been detained. The office of the attorney general, a former Maduro loyalist who has turned against him over his push to rewrite the constitution, named three national guard sergeants on Thursday, saying they were charged with homicide for that shooting and that a court had put them in custody.

The United States assessed that the test, the latest in a series of engine and missile trials this year, could be for the smallest stage of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) rocket engine, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. A second U.S. official also confirmed the test but did not provide additional details on the type of rocket component that was being tested or whether it fit into the ICBM program. One official said he believed the test had taken place within the past 24 hours. North Korea's state media, which is normally quick to publicize successful missile-related developments, did not carry any reports on the engine test.  South Korean officials did not have details about the reported test and declined to comment on the possible nature of the engine. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said China opposed any action that violated UN Security Council resolutions and called for restraint from all parties. South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who was elected last month on a platform of a more moderate approach to Pyongyang including dialogue to ease tension, inspected the test-launch of a ballistic missile on Friday that is being developed by the South's military.  I believe in dialogue, but dialogue is possible when it's backed by strong defense and engagement policy is possible only when we have security ability that can overwhelm the North,  Moon was quoted by his office as saying at the test site. Moon's office did not disclose the details of the missile being tested, but South Korea has been working to develop ballistic missiles with a range of 800 km (500 miles), a voluntary cap under an agreement with the United States. The United States has tried for years to discourage South Korea from developing longer-range ballistic missiles in keeping with the Missile Technology Control Regime, a voluntary international arms-control pact. China Pressed to Exert Pressure  The disclosure of the North's engine test came a day after the United States pressed China to exert more economic and diplomatic pressure on North Korea to help rein in its nuclear and missile programs during a round of high-level talks in Washington. A North Korean flag is pictured at its embassy in Beijing January 6, 2016.Kim Kyung-HoonMoon told Reuters in an exclusive interview on Thursday that strong new sanctions would be needed if the North conducted a new nuclear test or an intercontinental ballistic missile test and that he planned to call on Chinese President Xi Jinping to play a greater role in reining in Pyongyang's arms program. However, the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman questioned such calls.  When the world says that it hopes China can do even more, I don't know what 'do even more' refers to,  Geng told a daily news briefing in Beijing on Friday.  We've said many times that China is making unremitting efforts to resolve the Korean peninsula nuclear issue, and plays an active and constructive role,  he said.  U.S. President Donald Trump has warned that a  major, major conflict  with North Korea is possible over its weapons programs, although U.S. officials say tougher sanctions, not military force, are the preferred option. China's top diplomat, Yang Jiechi, told Trump in a meeting at the White House that Beijing was willing to  maintain communication and coordination  with the United States in an effort to defuse tension on the Korean peninsula, according to a statement from China's Foreign Ministry on Friday. The head of the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency told Congress last month that North Korea, if left unchecked, was on an  inevitable  path to obtaining a nuclear-armed missile capable of striking the U.S. mainland. However, experts say Pyongyang could still be years away from have a reliable ICBM capability. The continental United States is around 5,600 miles (9,000 km) from North Korea. ICBMs have a minimum range of about 3,400 miles (5,500 km), but some are designed to travel 6,200 miles (10,000 km) or farther. Any military solution to the North Korea crisis would be  tragic on an unbelievable scale , Trump's defense secretary, Jim Mattis, said last month.  The United States, meanwhile, is ramping up capabilities to defend against the threat from North Korea, staging its first-ever successful test to intercept an incoming ICBM-type missile in May. But a test on June 21 of a new capability being developed by the United States and Japan to defend against shorter-range missiles failed to hit its target, the U.S. Missile Defense Agency said on Thursday. It was the second such test of the SM-3 Block IIA interceptor, which is being developed by Raytheon (RTN.N). The previous intercept test, conducted in February, had been successful.

Russian authorities are asking Western tech companies to allow them to review source code for security products such as firewalls, anti-virus applications and software containing encryption before permitting the products to be imported and sold in the country. The requests, which have increased since 2014, are ostensibly done to ensure foreign spy agencies have not hidden any  backdoors  that would allow them to burrow into Russian systems. But those inspections also provide the Russians an opportunity to find vulnerabilities in the products' source code - instructions that control the basic operations of computer equipment - current and former U.S. officials and security experts said. While a number of U.S. firms say they are playing ball to preserve their entree to Russia's huge tech market, at least one U.S. firm, Symantec, told Reuters it has stopped cooperating with the source code reviews over security concerns. That halt has not been previously reported. Symantec said one of the labs inspecting its products was not independent enough from the Russian government. U.S. officials say they have warned firms about the risks of allowing the Russians to review their products' source code, because of fears it could be used in cyber attacks. But they say they have no legal authority to stop the practice unless the technology has restricted military applications or violates U.S. sanctions. From their side, companies say they are under pressure to acquiesce to the demands from Russian regulators or risk being shut out of a lucrative market. The companies say they only allow Russia to review their source code in secure facilities that prevent code from being copied or altered. (Graphic on source code review process: tmsnrt.rs/2sZudWT) The demands are being made by Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB), which the U.S. government says took part in the cyber attacks on Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign and the 2014 hack of 500 million Yahoo email accounts. The FSB, which has denied involvement in both the election and Yahoo hacks, doubles as a regulator charged with approving the sale of sophisticated technology products in Russia. The reviews are also conducted by the Federal Service for Technical and Export Control (FSTEC), a Russian defense agency tasked with countering cyber espionage and protecting state secrets. Records published by FSTEC and reviewed by Reuters show that from 1996 to 2013, it conducted source code reviews as part of approvals for 13 technology products from Western companies. In the past three years alone it carried out 28 reviews. A Kremlin spokesman referred all questions to the FSB. The FSB did not respond to requests for comment. FSTEC said in a statement that its reviews were in line with international practice. The U.S. State Department declined to comment. Moscow's source code requests have mushroomed in scope since U.S.-Russia relations went into a tailspin following the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014, according to eight current and former U.S. officials, four company executives, three U.S. trade attorneys and Russian regulatory documents. In addition to IBM, Cisco and Germany's SAP, Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co and McAfee have also allowed Russia to conduct source code reviews of their products, according to people familiar with the companies' interactions with Moscow and Russian regulatory records. Until now, little has been known about that regulatory review process outside of the industry. The FSTEC documents and interviews with those involved in the reviews provide a rare window into the tense push-and-pull between technology companies and governments in an era of mounting alarm about hacking. Roszel Thomsen, an attorney who helps U.S. tech companies navigate Russia import laws, said the firms must balance the dangers of revealing source code to Russian security services against possible lost sales.  Some companies do refuse,  he said.  Others look at the potential market and take the risk.   We Have a Real Concern  If tech firms do decline the FSB's source code requests, then approval for their products can be indefinitely delayed or denied outright, U.S. trade attorneys and U.S. officials said. The Russian information technology market is expected to be worth $18.4 billion this year, according to market researcher International Data Corporation (IDC). Six current and former U.S. officials who have dealt with companies on the issue said they are suspicious about Russia's motives for the expanded reviews.  It’s something we have a real concern about,  said a former senior Commerce Department official who had direct knowledge of the interaction between U.S. companies and Russian officials until he left office this year.  You have to ask yourself what it is they are trying to do, and clearly they are trying to look for information they can use to their advantage to exploit, and that’s obviously a real problem.  However, none of the officials who spoke to Reuters could point to specific examples of hacks or cyber espionage that were made possible by the review process. Source code requests are not unique to Russia. In the United States, tech companies allow the government to audit source code in limited instances as part of defense contracts and other sensitive government work. China sometimes also requires source code reviews as a condition to import commercial software, U.S. trade attorneys say.  Clean Rooms  The reviews often takes place in secure facilities known as  clean rooms.  Several of the Russian companies that conduct the testing for Western tech companies on behalf of Russian regulators have current or previous links to the Russian military, according to their websites. Echelon, a Moscow-based technology testing company, is one of several independent FSB-accredited testing centers that Western companies can hire to help obtain FSB approval for their products. Echelon CEO Alexey Markov told Reuters his engineers review source code in special laboratories, controlled by the companies, where no software data can be altered or transferred. Markov said Echelon is a private and independent company but does have a business relationship with Russia’s military and law enforcement authorities. Echelon’s website touts medals it was awarded in 2013 by Russia’s Ministry of Defense for  protection of state secrets.  The company’s website also sometimes refers to Markov as the  Head of Attestation Center of the Ministry of Defense.  In an email, Markov said that title is only intended to convey Echelon’s role as a certified outside tester of military technology testing. The medals were generic and insignificant, he said. But for Symantec, the lab  didn't meet our bar  for independence, said spokeswoman Kristen Batch. “In the case of Russia, we decided the protection of our customer base through the deployment of uncompromised security products was more important than pursuing an increase in market share in Russia,” said Batch, who added that the company did not believe Russia had tried to hack into its products. In 2016, the company decided it would no longer use third parties, including Echelon, that have ties to a foreign state or get most of their revenue from government-mandated security testing.  It poses a risk to the integrity of our products that we are not willing to accept,  she said. Without the source code approval, Symantec can no longer get approval to sell some of its business-oriented security products in Russia.  As a result, we do minimal business there,  she said. Markov declined to comment on Symantec’s decision, citing a non-disclosure agreement with the company. Trusted Labs Over the past year, HP has used Echelon to allow FSTEC to review source code, according to the agency's records. A company spokesman declined to comment. An IBM spokesman confirmed the company allows Russia to review its source code in secure, company-controlled facilities  where strict procedures are followed.  FSTEC certification records showed the Information Security Center, an independent testing company based outside Moscow, has reviewed IBM’s source code on behalf of the agency. The company was founded more than 20 years ago under the auspices of an institute within Russia’s Ministry of Defense, according to its website. The company did not respond to requests for comment. In a statement, McAfee said the Russia code reviews were conducted  at  certified testing labs  at company-owned premises in the United States. SAP allows Russia to review and test source code in a secure SAP facility in Germany, according to a person familiar with the process. In a company statement, SAP said the review process assures Russian customers “their SAP software investments are safe and secure.” Cisco has recently allowed Russia to review source code, according to a person familiar with the matter. A Cisco spokeswoman declined to comment on the company's interactions with Russian authorities but said the firm does sometimes allow regulators to inspect small parts of its code in  trusted  independent labs and that the reviews do not compromise the security of its products. Before allowing the reviews, Cisco scrutinizes the code to ensure they are not exposing vulnerabilities that could be used to hack the products, she said.

Crude oil prices bounced off this week's 10-month lows, but were still set for their worst first-half performance in almost two decades. Sliding oil prices have added to concerns on the inflation outlook, which along with a flattening yield curve, could pose a challenge to the Fed in deciding whether the economy was ready for another interest rate hike this year.  There is a concern that economy maybe struggling slightly, with oil prices hitting lows,  said Andre Bakhos, managing director at Janlyn Capital in Bernardsville, New Jersey.  If it's a supply problem, it's wonderful for the market,  he said.  If it is demand that is starting to wane, then it's going to create more questions than give us answers.  At current levels, the S&P; 500 energy index, down 15 percent so far this year, is on track to post its worst weekly decline in about 18 months. U.S. stocks ended flat on Thursday, but healthcare stocks rallied as Senate Republicans unveiled legislation that would replace Obamacare with a plan that scales back aid to the poor and kills a tax on the wealthy.

Nasdaq 100 e-minis were down 3.5 points, or 0.06 percent, on volume of 21,194 contracts. Shares of Bank of America, JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs were up between 0.75 percent and 1 percent in premarket trading, following the Fed's stress test results on Thursday. The results showed that 34 largest U.S. banks have all cleared the first stage, implying they would be able to maintain enough capital in an extreme recession. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, Cleveland Fed chief Loretta Mester and Fed governor Jerome Powell are all scheduled to make appearances later in the day.

Four conservative lawmakers said they could not support it in its current form, leaving Republicans short of the votes they need for passage. Democrats are united in opposition.     The 142-page proposal, worked out in secret by a group led Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, aims to deliver on a central campaign promise of President Donald Trump by rolling back former President Barack Obama's signature healthcare law, which has provided coverage to millions of Americans since it was passed in 2010. Republicans view the law, formally known as the Affordable Care Act, as a costly government intrusion into the private marketplace. Trump welcomed the bill but indicated that changes may be in store.  I am very supportive of the Senate #Healthcarebill. Look forward to making it really special!  he wrote on Twitter. Trump urged the House of Representatives to pass a similar bill in May, only to criticize it in private as  mean  once it passed. He said on Wednesday he wanted a health plan  with heart.   Democrats immediately attacked the legislation as a callous giveaway to the rich that would leave millions without coverage.  The president said the House bill was mean,  said Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer.  The Senate bill may be even meaner.  Obama weighed in on Facebook.  If there’s a chance you might get sick, get old, or start a family – this bill will do you harm,  he wrote. The Senate's most conservative members said the plan did not do enough to scale back the U.S. government's role. Related CoverageTrump says he is 'very supportive' of Senate healthcare billFactbox: How Senate, House Obamacare overhaul bills compareFactbox: Where key U.S. Republican senators stand on healthcare bill This current bill does not repeal Obamacare. It does not keep our promises to the American people,  said Senator Rand Paul, who along with fellow Republican Senators Ted Cruz, Mike Lee and Ron Johnson said they could not support it in its current form. Shares of hospital companies and health insurers rose on the bill's release, with the overall S&P; 500 healthcare sector closing up 1.1 percent at an all-time high.  The initial proposal I think is more generous and more positive to the industry than expected,  said Jeff Jonas, a portfolio manager with Gabelli Funds. Sharper Cuts to Medicaid Over months of often bitter debate, Republicans have struggled to craft legislation that lowers costs and reduces government involvement, while minimizing the inevitable disruptions that would come with a revamp of a sector that accounts for one-sixth of the world's largest economy. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found that the House bill would kick 23 million Americans off their health plans, and the legislation is unpopular with the public. Fewer than one in 3 Americans supports it, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling. Senator Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is surrounded by reporters as he walks to the Senate floor of the U.S. Capitol after unveiling a draft bill on healthcare in Washington, U.S. June 22, 2017.Kevin LamarqueThe Senate measure maintains much of the structure of the House bill, but differs in several key ways. The Senate bill would phase out Obamacare's expansion of the Medicaid program for the poor more gradually than the House version, waiting until after the next presidential election in 2020, but would enact deeper cuts starting in 2025. It would also allow states to add work requirements for some of the 70 million Americans who depend on the program.  The legislation also provides more generous tax subsidies than the House bill to help low-income people buy private insurance.  Those subsidies would be based on income, rather than the age-based subsidies contained in the House bill - a  major improvement,  according to Republican Senator Susan Collins, a key moderate who has expressed concern over the bill's impact on the poor.  The Senate legislation provides less money, however, for the opioid epidemic, allocating $2 billion in 2018, compared with  $45 billion over 10 years in the House version.  Slideshow (10 Images)Both versions would repeal the 3.8 percent net investment income tax on high earners, a key target for Republicans.  They also would repeal a penalty imposed on large employers that do not provide insurance to their workers, and remove the fine that Obamacare imposes on those who choose to go uninsured. Policy experts said that would keep more young, healthy people out of the market and likely create a sicker patient pool. The Senate bill would provide money to stabilize the individual insurance market, allotting $15 billion a year in 2018 and 2019 and $10 billion a year in 2020 and 2021. It proposes defunding Planned Parenthood for a year, but abortion-related restrictions are less stringent than the House version because of uncertainty over whether they would comply with Senate rules. They could be included in another Senate bill. McConnell said Democrats chose not to help frame the bill, which Republicans say would fix a collapsing health marketplace.  Republicans believe we have a responsibility to act, and we are,  he said. Democrats say they offered to help fix Obamacare but were rebuffed. The bill's real-world impact is not yet known, but the CBO is expected to provide an estimate early next week. As lawmakers spoke about the legislation on the Senate floor, a protest erupted outside McConnell's personal office, with many people in wheelchairs blocking a hallway, holding signs and chanting:  No cuts to Medicaid.  U.S. Capitol Police said 43 protesters were arrested and charged with obstruction. Aside from the quartet of conservatives, none of the other 48 Republican senators appeared to reject the bill out of hand. But several said they would check with home-state constituents before taking a position.  I expect there's going to be a number of changes between now and the final vote,  said Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming.

Aveo's shares surged 58 percent to $1.15 in premarket trading. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) said experts at its Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) had backed the oral, once-daily drug for marketing approval as a first-line treatment for advanced renal cell carcinoma, or kidney cancer. The drug was also backed for treating adult patients with advanced kidney cancer who met certain criteria and had received one prior treatment with cytokine therapy, the EMA said. Recommendations for marketing approval by the CHMP are normally endorsed by the European Commission within a couple of months. Europe has among the highest incidence rates of kidney cancer in the world, with about 115,000 people diagnosed with cancers of the kidney, renal pelvis and the ureter in 2012. The green light from the EMA comes after a series of stumbles for Aveo's drug, tivozanib, or Fotivda. The treatment, first licensed by Aveo from Japan's Kyowa Hakko Kirin over seven years ago, was turned down by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2013 for inconsistent study results.

Barry Cadden, the co-founder of the now-defunct New England Compounding Center, was convicted of those charges by a jury in March but cleared of the harshest charge he faced, second-degree murder charges. His lawyers urged the judge to consider a much shorter sentence of about three years. A murder conviction would have meant a life sentence, and prosecutors in a court filing late on Thursday said Cadden, 50, said that punishment was still warranted. They said Cadden's conduct led to 76 deaths, a figure higher than the 64 that authorities previously said resulted from a fungal meningitis outbreak that sickened 753 people in 20 states who received injections of tainted steroids sold by his company.  The magnitude and ripple effects of the pain caused by the loss of life is immeasurable,  prosecutors wrote. Cadden's lawyers in their own filing ahead of Monday's sentencing acknowledged he  did things, and particularly failed to do things, that in hindsight he deeply regrets.  FILE PHOTO - Barry Cadden is seen in this booking photo released by Wrentham Police Department in Wrentham, Massachusetts, U.S. on March 7, 2017.  Courtesy Wrentham Police Department/Handout via REUTERSBut they said prosecutors were trying to present a  demonized picture  of Cadden, who deserved 30 to 37 months in prison. They said he was not convicted of knowing the drugs were contaminated, just of misrepresenting how they were made. Cadden was one of 14 people tied to Framingham, Massachusetts-based New England Compounding Center (NECC) indicted in 2014 following the outbreak. Prosecutors said Cadden, NECC's head pharmacist, ran the company as a criminal enterprise that sold substandard and non-sterile drugs produced in filthy conditions and shipped to medical facilities nationally for use on unsuspecting patients. They said Cadden directed the shipment of 17,600 vials of contaminated steroids often prescribed for back pain despite knowing they were made in unsafe conditions, leading to the outbreak. The victims included Douglas Wingate, a 47-year-old Virginian who died after receiving an injection in September 2012 for back and neck pain. Sharon Wingate, his wife, said she plans to attend the sentencing and wants to see Cadden  spend the rest of his life in prison.   So many people have been impacted by this that I'm hoping the judge will use this to give us our day, give us the victims our day, our justice,  she said in a recent interview.

Aveo's shares surged 58 percent to $1.15 in premarket trading. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) said experts at its Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) had backed the oral, once-daily drug for marketing approval as a first-line treatment for advanced renal cell carcinoma, or kidney cancer. The drug was also backed for treating adult patients with advanced kidney cancer who met certain criteria and had received one prior treatment with cytokine therapy, the EMA said. Recommendations for marketing approval by the CHMP are normally endorsed by the European Commission within a couple of months. Europe has among the highest incidence rates of kidney cancer in the world, with about 115,000 people diagnosed with cancers of the kidney, renal pelvis and the ureter in 2012. The green light from the EMA comes after a series of stumbles for Aveo's drug, tivozanib, or Fotivda. The treatment, first licensed by Aveo from Japan's Kyowa Hakko Kirin over seven years ago, was turned down by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2013 for inconsistent study results. The company has since ended an agreement with Astellas Pharma Inc to help develop the drug.

Chief Executive Pieter van der Does said on Friday that his  Amsterdam-based company was awarded a European regional banking licence in late April by the Dutch Central Bank on behalf of the European Central Bank. Swedish payments processing rival Klarna said last week that it also had been granted a European banking licence by the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority, as more fintech players seek to level the regulatory playing field versus banks. The European banking license gives Adyen the status of an acquiring bank, clearing the way for it to process merchant payments nearly instantly, rather than relying on banking partners to handle settlements over several days.  We are displacing the banks because we have our own banking licence,  van der Does said in an interview on the sidelines of the NOAH venture capital conference in Berlin. Adyen itself has no plans to become a deposit-taking, full-service bank, but looks for the licence to give it control over the payments process to assure merchants of faster settlements.  The company, which handles international payments for eight of the top 10 global ecommerce giants including Airbnb, Booking.com, Spotify and Facebook, began seeking bank licences in other jurisdictions six years ago, van der Does said. It also handles international payments for a large number of airlines and a growing number of retailers with global operations. In Brazil, Adyen is already licensed as a local payments institution. It is pursuing licences in the United States and other parts of Latin America and Asia.  Van der Does said that Adyen acts as the acquiring bank for a little over half of all of its transaction volume, which grew to $90 billion in 2016, up 80 percent from a year earlier.  So far, it is an acquirer for merchants in Australia, Brazil, Europe, Hong Kong and the United States. The company relies on renting licences from banking partners in some areas of its business, including airline payments processing, in order to avoid having to assume balance sheet risk in that potentially volatile market.

Valor Econômico said on Friday that Goldfajn reiterated that interest rate decisions, including the next one scheduled for July 26, depended on several variables, such as inflation expectations. He said recent data corroborated the scenario the central bank had prior to the political crisis that erupted in late May with the corruption investigation against President Michel Temer. At that time, the central bank had been signaling it would keep or even accelerate the pace of interest rate cuts.  We have more than a month to watch,  the paper quoted Goldfajn as saying in a phone interview. On Thursday, the bank lowered its inflation forecasts and reiterated that its next policy decisions depended on upcoming economic data, indicating it was still unsure whether to reduce the pace of interest rate cuts in July. At 10.25 percent, the benchmark rate is down from 14.25 percent in October. Brazil is slowly emerging from a two-year recession, and lower interest rates are expected to speed up the recovery by encouraging investments and consumption.

ABUJA, June 23 (Reuters) - Nigeria's acting president met with regional leaders in an effort to quell ethnic tensions, his office said, as threats grow of conflict between northern Muslims and southeastern Igbo people. The two groups have been trading barbs since the beginning of the month, after Muslim activists demanded the eviction of Igbo from the north over their calls for a separate southeastern state, known as Biafra. The expulsion notice is an echo, 51 years later, of the anti-Igbo pogroms across the north that helped spark the secession of Biafra in 1967. The resulting civil war ended with Nigeria's victory in 1970, after an estimated 1 million people died.  There is a point where a line has to be drawn, and that is when conversations or agitations degenerate into hateful rhetoric, where the narrative descends into pejorative name-calling, expressions of outright prejudice and hatred,  said Yemi Osinbajo, Nigeria's acting leader, according to a statement late on Thursday. Osinbajo met with leaders from the north and southeast, state governors and media publishers and editors, the statement said.  It will be wrong of us to approach our grievances by threatening to disobey the laws or by threatening the integrity of our nation,  Osinbajo told leaders. Nigeria is no stranger to ethnically charged violence. Deadly clashes between Muslim herders and Christian farmers have erupted in recent years, partly over land use in the region known as the Middle Belt. In the eastern state of Taraba, part of the Middle Belt, 10 people have died since last week in ethnic clashes, a police spokesman said.

No more.  In the political and market turmoil immediately before and following Britain's decision last June to leave the European Union, financial market investors flipped their long-held bias against the euro and now expect sterling to be the riskier party for years to come. Reuters data going back to 2012 shows three- and five-year risk reversals -- the cost of taking out an option to buy or sell the pound -- have consistently been below zero. That indicated it was almost always more expensive to hedge against the risk of euro exchange rates collapsing than of the same happening in sterling.  There are always blips. On a handful of occasions since Mario Draghi's promise to do  whatever it takes  to prop up the euro in 2012, the single currency has briefly been valued as steadier for the long term. But since an initial jump in the first six months of 2016, both three- and five-year euro-sterling risk reversal contracts have held consistently in positive territory, indicating the tail risk -- the risk of a low probability, high impact event -- is now instead with the pound.  That is the first time in Reuters' historical data on the options market and means it will be increasingly costly for investors exposed to the pound's exchange rate to insure portfolios against further slides.  With the pound pummelled by political and economic uncertainty, the euro/sterling five-year risk reversal on Thursday matched its highest in 11 months, showing an increased bias towards sterling weakness.     This followed open disagreement among Bank of England policymakers on the outlook for interest rates and, by extension, the pound. On Tuesday BoE Governor Mark Carney said now was not the time to raise rates, warning of weak wage growth as Britain prepared to quit the EU. On Wednesday, the central bank's chief economist, Andy Haldane, said he was likely to join those voting for a hike later this year.     Bankers are cautious about predicting further steep falls in the pound, but some senior currency market players wonder what will happen to sterling if Brexit talks turn bad.  Some in the sales teams that focus on selling cheap option plays to hedge fund investors wanting to speculate on currency moves say the change is reflective of the broad swing in political risk.   Risk reversals tend to price fear,  said the head of hedge fund sales with one of the big five international banks who run 40 percent of the $5 trillion a day global currency market.   It is when you are thinking you are going to get a big gap move. And historically the gap move that was on people's minds over the last five years was the euro break-up story. This signals a change in the potential tail risks.  At a time when global measures of volatility are at rock bottom, those in sterling have jumped in the past fortnight, driven initially by a shock electoral turnaround that saw Prime Minister Theresa May deprived of her parliamentary majority.  Analysts say the move in the longer-term risk reversals, however, point to a broader questioning of faith in the pound.   The market is willing to pay a higher premium to hedge against a large sterling depreciation,  said Sam Lynton-Brown, a strategist with BNP Paribas in London.   That is a change.

Every schoolgirl is Kenya is entitled to  free, sufficient and quality sanitary towels  and a safe place to dispose of them, according to the law introduced this week.  We are treating the access to sanitary pads as a basic human right,  government spokesman Eric Kiraithe told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.      We are improving the sanitation and healthcare of our schoolgirls, which will boost their class attendance.  Menstruation is still taboo in many countries around the world, where it's often considered embarrassing or shameful. One in 10 African girls miss school during their periods, the U.N. children's agency UNICEF estimates, which means they fall behind in their studies and often drop out of school.  This will give girls confidence to attend class on any day of the month, consequently improving their academic performance,  said Albanous Gituru, director of Shining Hope for Communities, a girls' school in Nairobi's Kibera slum. Girls can miss up to 15 days of school each term because they cannot afford sanitary products, he said. In neighboring Uganda, researchers from Oxford University found absenteeism from school was 17 percent higher among girls who had no access to sanitary towels or information about puberty. When 10 percent more girls go to school, a country's GDP increases by an average of 3 percent. Each additional year of secondary schooling leads to a 15-25 percent increase in a girl's potential income, say gender equality campaigners. The policy will cost Kenya 500 million shillings ($4.8 million) a year, Kiraithe said, expanding on a 2011 program giving pads to girls from poor families.

Gas Natural hired Rothschild at the beginning of this year to find buyers for its Italian activities. The Spanish company, which has been in Italy since 2002, runs more than 7,000 km of regulated gas distribution pipelines, mainly in the south, alongside a retail business that sells gas and power to over 420,000 families and 17,000 companies.  There are offers coming from at least five-six groups, excluding funds,  a source close to the matter told Reuters. Italy's biggest gas distributor Italgas recently said it was interested in the distribution assets of Gas Natural. Infrastructure fund F2i, which controls 2i Rete Gas, is also looking at the same assets, two sources said. According to the sources, France's Edison and Engie are looking at the retail business of the Spanish group, but Italy's top utility Enel will not file a bid. An offer is also expected by regional utility A2A, which said recently it would bid for some assets. Foreign funds are looking at the whole package, which includes a project to build a liquefied natural gas terminal and other minor assets, sources said. Edison, F2i, Engie and A2A declined to comment. A deadline to table non-binding offers expires on Friday and Gas Natural and Rothschild are expected to short list some of the bidders before asking for binding offers in September.

The Fed raised interest rates for the second time in three months last week, signalling its confidence in a growing U.S. economy and strengthening jobs market. But investors are pricing in only around a 50 percent chance that it will hike rates again by the end of the year. The dollar index, which measures it against a basket of six major currencies, inched down by a quarter of a percent, leaving it almost exactly where it was trading immediately after last week's hike.  More than a week after the FOMC lifted borrowing costs in the U.S., financial markets... have been treading water as investors struggle to find a new driver,  said Swissquote currency analyst Arnaud Masset. The euro edged up 0.2 percent to $1.1174, having earlier hit a four-day high but having then eased after data showing euro zone business growth tailed off unexpectedly toward the end of the first half of 2017. The European Central Bank is watching such growth indicators carefully as it decides when and how quickly to wind back its expansive quantitative easing (QE) programme. UBS currency strategist Daniel Trum, in Zurich, said currency markets were not showing great sensitivity to data, but that the euro had been lifted this week by consumer confidence hitting a 16-year high in June. The dollar peaked at a one-month high on Tuesday after the Federal Reserve hiked interest rates last week and left the door open for further monetary tightening later in the year. But it has been stuck in a tight range since, awaiting fresh catalysts. U.S. data due next week include the June consumer confidence indicator, pending home sales, crude oil inventories, revised first quarter GDP and the PCE price index.  While most U.S. indicators bear watching, what really matters for the dollar are wages and inflation-related data, culminating with the non-farm payrolls in two weeks' time,  said Makoto Noji, a senior strategist at SMBC Nikko Securities. Commodity-linked currencies held to significant gains made on Thursday following a rebound in crude oil prices from 10-month lows. The Canadian dollar was flat at C$1.3236 per U.S. dollar after rallying 0.75 percent on Thursday. Exactly a year after Britain voted to leave the European Union, sterling was around a third of a percent stronger on the day at $1.2727, with some investors betting the Bank of England could raise interest rates as soon as August. In the year since the vote, the pound has fallen more than 15 percent against the dollar and almost 13 percent versus the euro.

Britain is an important destination for Danish agricultural and food products like bacon and butter and Denmark exports more than 12 billion Danish crowns ($1.8 billion) of agri-food products to Britain each year, according to the report. The study by University of Copenhagen researchers for the Ministry of Environment and Food, found the  best case scenario  with a free trade agreement between the block and UK, would see Danish food exports to Britain fall by as much as 48 percent. In a situation where Britain fails to strike a deal on a new relationship with the EU and comes under World Trade Organisation rules, the decline in exports could be as much as 79 percent.  Even if the UK manages to negotiate an FTA (free trade agreement) with EU27, such that goods trade will not be subjected to tariff barriers, this will presumably still lead to an increase in overall trade costs,  the report said. However, the report stated that the total reduction in Danish exports will be quite small in both scenarios due to the possibility of redirecting exports within the European Union and partner countries to the various preferential trade agreements.

Germany's top court earlier this month declared the country's nuclear fuel tax to be illegal, a major victory for power firms now poised to reclaim about 6.3 billion euros ($7.03 billion) plus interest and ease the strain on their balance sheets. The decision creates a windfall for RWE and its peers E.ON and EnBW, which were hit hard by German Chancellor Angela Merkel's swift decision to exit nuclear power by 2022, a move prompted by the disaster at Fukushima, Japan, in March 2011. For RWE, the ruling means a reimbursement of around 1.7 billion euros. The special dividend will account for around 615 million of that.  We are aware that we asked a lot of our shareholders by suspending the dividend on common shares in the last two years,  Chief Executive Rolf Martin Schmitz said.  We feel it is both fair and appropriate to distribute part of the tax refund among our shareholders,  he added. The group will use the rest of the reimbursement to improve its financial strength, finance chief Markus Krebber said. The tax refund will not affect RWE's operating earnings forecast as it will be recognised in its non-operating results, RWE said.

Norwegians have built up the fund with revenues from the country's vast offshore oil and gas sector and it is regarded as an insurance policy for when those reserves run out, meaning any changes will be subject to close political and public scrutiny. In the future, the fund should be managed by a new state investment company with a government-appointed board and an investment mandate set by the finance ministry, the commission said.  Both central banking and investment management place greater demands on the (central bank's) board, senior management and the organisation than earlier,  said commission head Svein Gjedrem, himself a former governor.  Moreover, the activities differ in nature, and the scope of the tasks involved is substantial. With two separate entities, the professional competence and the governing bodies can more easily be tailored to the task at hand,  he added. The recommendations will be closely examined by Norwegian politicians, who had said ahead of the publication they were waiting for the report's conclusions before deciding what new assets, if any, the fund could invest in. The fund, which is managed by a unit of the central bank, invests in bonds, stocks and real estate abroad, but is seeking to add new higher-yielding investments such as unlisted equity or infrastructure. Norway's central bank, or Norges Bank, welcomed the report.  Norges Bank has built a professional investment management organisation that is well equipped to perform its task ahead, irrespective of the organisational structure,  it said. Central Bank Management Reform Currently the bank's board is responsible for running the bank, supervising the wealth fund and setting monetary policy, but this should change, said the commission, which also made proposals for the future organisation of Norges Bank. Those proposals envisage a monetary policy committee chaired by the governor and also consisting of the deputy governor, two part-time external members and one member who is also a full-time employee of the central bank. The proposals will be subject to public hearings, and any changes will ultimately be decided by parliament. Terje Breivik, a lawmaker from Norway's Liberal Party, a key external backer of the right-wing minority government, said he was pleased with the proposal to split the fund from the bank.  This was our suggestion last year. The chances are of course very big that it will happen now,  he told Reuters.

His former team mate and fellow Briton Bradley Wiggins, who won the Tour in 2012, was legally given triamcinolone shortly before the 2011 and 2012 Tours and the 2013 Giro d'Italia to treat pollen allergies that aggravated asthma. Wiggins was allowed to take triamcinolone after being cleared by cycling's world governing body (UCI) under a therapeutic use exemption (TUE), which allows athletes to take otherwise banned substances to treat medical conditions. During an ongoing investigation by UK Anti-Doping (UKAD) into allegations of possible wrongdoing by the British team, it was disclosed earlier this year that 55 doses of triamcinolone had been ordered by Team Sky between 2010 and 2013. However, Froome, who like Wiggins had his medical records, including the use of TUEs, made public by Russian cyber hackers Fancy Bears last year, said he had never used triamcinolone.  I can only speak about my experiences in the team at the time,  Froome, who is focused on trying to win a fourth Tour de France at next month's race, told The Guardian.  I certainly haven't been offered triamcinolone in the team.  Team Sky has been under a cloud over the contents of a 'jiffy bag' delivered to the team's then doctor Richard Freeman at the 2011 Criterium du Dauphine. A newspaper report alleged it was triamcinolone, although team principal Dave Brailsford said the package contained the legal flu treatment Fluimucil. Brailsford told a parliamentary committee in December that  mistakes were made  in Team Sky's record-keeping but he has always denied that the team was involved in any wrongdoing. The saga is likely to drag on throughout the Tour de France and 32-year-old Froome, who is negotiating a new deal with Sky where he is under contract until the end of next year, said it was an unnecessary distraction.  Honestly, I haven't given it much thought,  he said.  It's not something I've gone and done my own investigation on. I've been so focused on getting ready for (the Tour in) July.  I can only speak about my experience in the team. It hasn't been my experience that triamcinolone has been handed out freely as has been suggested.  Team Sky have said that only a small amount of the triamcinolone was administered to riders under TUEs with the rest being used to treat staff members.

Consumer agencies across Europe have been pushing for compensation for Volkswagen (VW) drivers who bought diesel cars on the strength of their green credentials. Despite VW's admission of wrongdoing in the United States, it says it has not broken the law in Europe and sees no need to compensate European consumers. The carmaker has committed to fixing all affected vehicles by autumn. But first-instance rulings by the regional courts of Arnsberg and Bayreuth published in May which upheld plaintiffs' calls for compensation have now become legally binding after VW decided to waive an appeal, the plaintiffs' lawyers at Duesseldorf-based law firm Rogert & Ulbrich said by email.  In future the injured parties may have justified hope that they will be able to enforce their claims in only one instance,  lawyer Marco Rogert said. VW played down the significance of the ruling, saying its decision to forego an appeal was an exception and stemmed from the low value of the vehicles in question. The carmaker does not expect the two rulings to have any bearing on other ongoing cases and, if necessary, will use its right to appeal unjustified customer complaints in future, it said in emailed comments. The law firm said VW decided not to appeal three compensation court cases including a verdict published in April by a regional court in Wuppertal, whereas VW said its course of action only affected the two cases at Arnsberg and Bayreuth.","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/volkswagen-emissions-court-idUSL1N1JK0EM"},

You either stick to health rules or contract diseases,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone. The health risks in Nyarugusu camp - home to around 100,000 refugees, mainly from Burundi and Democratic Republic of Congo - have grown due to an influx of people this year, amid spikes in the political instability afflicting both countries.  But Thenest, who came to the camp two years ago at the height of political tensions in Burundi, has learned how to protect his family from bouts of diarrheal diseases - a major cause of death in children under five. “I always ensure that my children use clean and safe water,” he said. “I have instructed them to wash their hands with soap after using a toilet.” Thenest, who works as a technician with international engineering charity Water Mission, said the health situation in the camp is improving as more people get access to clean water from a recently installed solar-powered water treatment facility. “The plant produces thousands of liters every day - women no longer go far to fetch water,” he said. As part of a broader initiative to help refugees access clean energy and sanitation, Water Mission is installing more such plants in three refugee camps in western Tanzania. The $5.3 million project, funded by the Denmark-based Poul Due Jensen Foundation, is expected to provide safe water for some 250,000 refugees in Nyarugusu, Nduta and Mtendeli camps. Benjamin Filskov, Water Mission’s country director, said “huge” investment in solar technologies by the organization would help communities access clean and safe water, and contribute towards achieving the world’s development goals. “We will document saved lives and ensure general public health, as a result of safe water,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. According to Water Mission, the Tanzania project aims to pump 100 percent of the water using solar power, with diesel generators as back up. A recent shipment of 780 solar panels to Tanzania will produce 226,000 watts of power and provide a continuous supply of safe water to keep children in good health, it said in a statement. Jordan Solar Farm With rising use of renewable energy, refugee communities in Africa and the Middle East are increasingly embracing solar power to help build their economic resilience, reduce deforestation and prevent violence against women and girls.

HANDOUT/Water MissionFrom Dadaab in Kenya, to Darfur in western Sudan and Azraq in Jordan, solar power is being deployed to provide affordable and sustainable energy solutions for tens of thousands of displaced people. In semi-arid eastern Kenya, Africa's largest solar-powered borehole - equipped with 278 solar panels - is providing 16,000 refugees in Dadaab camp with a daily average of about 280,000 liters of water, which they use for drinking, cooking and personal hygiene, according to the European Commission. In Azraq, a 2-megawatt solar farm that started operating in May - the world's first in a refugee camp - has enabled the U.N. refugee agency, UNHCR, to provide free, clean electricity to 20,000 Syrian refugees, covering the energy needs of two villages connected to the national grid.  Refugee families can now run a fridge, TV, fans and lights in their shelters, and recharge their phones, which is crucial for maintaining contact with loved ones abroad, the agency said. Yet while access to clean energy for refugees and their host communities is a global priority for UNHCR, analysts say millions of displaced people still lack access to sustainable, cheap energy sources because of a lack of funding.

HANDOUT/Water MissionSafety for Women At Kakuma refugee camp in northwest Kenya, residents receive 10 kg of firewood for cooking every eight weeks, but for most, it is not enough, said Anna Okello, a research analyst with Practical Action Consulting International who works in the camp. The need to gather extra firewood often results in personal security problems as adolescent girls and women face sexual harassment when they go out to collect it, she said. Clean energy sources like solar can deliver benefits to refugees by enhancing safety, security, health and livelihoods, she added.   “If reliance on firewood can be lessened through solar cooking, this will have a direct impact on the development and protection of women in the camp,” she said.  For example, it frees up time otherwise spent on firewood collection or cleaning sooty pots, she explained. A lack of electric power has caused other problems for Kakuma's nearly 180,000 inhabitants.  “I don’t dare go to the toilet alone at night because it’s too dark,” said Aisha Ilanda, 31, from Congo. Providing solar street lamps and lanterns and energy-efficient cooking stoves can greatly improve the lives of refugees and contribute to their protection, Okello said. Introducing solar technology to Kakuma could also help build economic resilience among refugees who make up a vibrant community exploiting new business opportunities such as charging mobile phones and operating money transfer services like M-Pesa. “Access to solar energy would help these businesses stay open longer; street lighting could make the streets safer; and solar lights can provide a safe learning space inside homes,” said Okello.  “The sun is plentiful in Africa - it’s free, it does not pollute and will never run out of power,” she added.

The judge in charge of the case will make a decision bearing in mind the prosecutor's recommendations. Judges usually follow the state prosecutor's guidance in Spain. Barcelona great Messi and his father Jorge were found guilty by a Catalan court last July on three counts of tax fraud between 2007 and 2009 to the tune of 4.1 million euros ($4.6 million) on image rights.  An appeal against the sentence was rejected by Spain's Supreme Court in May. Neither Argentina captain Messi nor his father were expected to serve time in jail, as under Spanish law sentences under two years can be served under probation. The Barcelona-based prosecutor handling the case also said that if the judge did not want to swap the prison term for a fine, it was open to a three-year suspended prison sentence for Messi and his father considering they had no prior offenses, a spokeswoman for the prosecutor said in an emailed statement. Messi's case was one of the first high-profile investigations by Spanish authorities into top football players' tax affairs. The state prosecutor earlier this month accused Real Madrid striker Cristiano Ronaldo of knowingly using a complex business structure to hide image rights income in Spain. Ronaldo has denied any wrongdoing. Messi, who has won eight La Liga titles, five King's Cups and four Champions League crowns with Barcelona, finished top scorer in Spain this season with 37 league goals. The five times world player of the year is Barcelona's all-time top scorer and their highest-paid player.  Messi and his father defrauded the Spanish tax office of 4.1 million euros between 2007 and 2009 by using a web of shell companies based in Belize, Switzerland and Uruguay to evade taxes on income from the player's image rights. The maximum fine allowed by law in substitution for Messi's 21-month prison sentence would be 255,500 euros, Reuters calculated. This would be on top of a nearly 2 million euro fine that was handed down as part of last year's sentence.

The two have been feuding bitterly and Western Digital, which jointly runs Toshiba's main semiconductor plant, has sought a U.S. court injunction to prevent any deal that does not have its consent. The softer tone from Toshiba comes on a day of further indignities as the crisis-wracked conglomerate saw itself demoted to the second section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange and estimated bigger losses for the past financial year. This week it chose a consortium of Bain Capital and Japanese government investors as preferred bidder for the unit, the world's No. 2 producer of NAND flash chips. It wants to clinch a deal, worth some $18 billion, by June 28, the day of its shareholders meeting.  Western Digital used to be a good partner, so we want to continue talks. I'm disappointed with the current dispute,  Toshiba CEO Satoshi Tsunakawa told a news conference, adding it was important that they joined forces to better compete against bigger rival Samsung Electronics.  We want Western Digital to jointly invest to fight against Samsung. It will be so disappointing if we can't do so because of the dispute,  he said. Related CoverageToshiba says open to talks with Western Digital over chip unit saleBut in a sign that tensions were still high, Tsunakawa also said Toshiba was not going to be the first to propose the U.S. firm join the consortium and it was still considering whether to block Western Digital employees not based at the plant from accessing joint venture data servers. Tsunakawa also said he did not expect any changes to the make-up of the consortium before June 28. Western Digital's offer had not found favor on price and because the U.S. firm wanted to take control of the unit, he said, adding that he expected executives from Toshiba to still be running operations after the sale. His comments come after sources familiar with matter said earlier this week that the Bain consortium members had made resolving the dispute with Western Digital a condition of their investment.

Hynix Hurdles? South Korean chipmaker SK Hynix Inc is also part of the Bain consortium and its membership has raised concerns that the winning bid may find it difficult to clear anti-trust reviews. Slideshow (4 Images)Its presence has made Western Digital reluctant to join the group in its current form due to worries that high-level technology for NAND chips, which provide long-term data storage, could be leaked to its rival, sources familiar with the matter have said. But Tsunakawa said SK Hynix would not be holding any equity and would not be involved in management - an arrangement that was unlikely to raise regulatory red flags and would prevent leaks of key technology information. SK Hynix, which is relatively weak in NAND flash memory chips, has said it has joined the group because it sees new business opportunities.

The European Medicines Agency said on Friday its experts had  backed the latest copy of the drug from South Korea's Samsung Bioepis, which specializes in making cheaper copies of complex biotech drugs known as biosimilars. The EU Commission, which has the final word on drug approvals in the region, typically follows the experts' advice.        Amgen won European approval for the first copy of the drug, also called adalimumab, in March.     These green lights clear the way for biosimilar copies of Humira to be launched in Europe in due course, although lawyers do not expect this to happen before October 2018, given the patents protecting adalimumab.     Samsung Bioepis, an unlisted unit of South Korean conglomerate Samsung Group [SAGR.UL], already sells biosimilar copies of two other rheumatoid arthritis drugs, Remicade and Enbrel, in Europe.  It will market its version of Humira under the brand name Imraldi.     While the company has yet to turn a profit since it was formed in 2012, Samsung Group hopes the biosimilars' maker will eventually emerge as a new growth engine for the smartphones-to-shipbuilding conglomerate.        Bioepis is 94.6 percent owned by contract drugmaker Samsung Biologics. U.S. biotech group Biogen is also a minority shareholder.

The two have been feuding bitterly and Western Digital, which jointly runs Toshiba's main semiconductor plant, has sought a U.S. court injunction to prevent any deal that does not have its consent. The softer tone from Toshiba comes on a day of further indignities as the crisis-wracked conglomerate saw itself demoted to the second section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange and estimated bigger losses for the past financial year. This week it chose a consortium of Bain Capital and Japanese government investors as preferred bidder for the unit, the world's No. 2 producer of NAND flash chips. It wants to clinch a deal, worth some $18 billion, by June 28, the day of its shareholders meeting.  Western Digital used to be a good partner, so we want to continue talks. I'm disappointed with the current dispute,  Toshiba CEO Satoshi Tsunakawa told a news conference, adding it was important that they joined forces to better compete against bigger rival Samsung Electronics.  We want Western Digital to jointly invest to fight against Samsung. It will be so disappointing if we can't do so because of the dispute,  he said. Related CoverageToshiba says open to talks with Western Digital over chip unit saleBut in a sign that tensions were still high, Tsunakawa also said Toshiba was not going to be the first to propose the U.S. firm join the consortium and it was still considering whether to block Western Digital employees not based at the plant from accessing joint venture data servers. Tsunakawa also said he did not expect any changes to the make-up of the consortium before June 28. Western Digital's offer had not found favor on price and because the U.S. firm wanted to take control of the unit, he said, adding that he expected executives from Toshiba to still be running operations after the sale. His comments come after sources familiar with matter said earlier this week that the Bain consortium members had made resolving the dispute with Western Digital a condition of their investment.

Hynix Hurdles? South Korean chipmaker SK Hynix Inc is also part of the Bain consortium and its membership has raised concerns that the winning bid may find it difficult to clear anti-trust reviews. Slideshow (4 Images)Its presence has made Western Digital reluctant to join the group in its current form due to worries that high-level technology for NAND chips, which provide long-term data storage, could be leaked to its rival, sources familiar with the matter have said. But Tsunakawa said SK Hynix would not be holding any equity and would not be involved in management - an arrangement that was unlikely to raise regulatory red flags and would prevent leaks of key technology information. SK Hynix, which is relatively weak in NAND flash memory chips, has said it has joined the group because it sees new business opportunities. It will provide half of the 850 billion yen ($7.6 billion) that Bain plans to put up in the form of financing, sources have said.

The free-floating rouble lost nearly 3 percent of its value against the dollar this week, hit by a slump in oil prices, new United States' sanctions against Moscow and fears of more financial and economic penalties from the West.  The new sanctions became a good moment for closing long rouble positions that non-residents had,  Valery Smirnov said. In a rare comment on the rouble rate from a central bank official, Smirnov said that the recent rouble depreciation was  generally adequate to changes in fundamental factors.  Smirnov, who heads fixed income, currency, commodity and global macro research at the central bank's monetary policy department, said the rouble is likely to trace oil prices in the following manner: The rouble would ease by 2.5 percent should oil prices decline by 10 percent.  If oil prices stay at the same levels, the exchange rate will stay approximately at the same levels,  Smirnov told an annual Thomson Reuters conference for market traders in Moscow late on Thursday. Commenting on other factors capable of moving the rouble, Smirnov took a cautious stance. When asked about a possible sell-off of Russian treasury bonds, known as OFZs, by foreign holders, Smirnov said he would not expect a  mega impact  on the rouble exchange rate from such a flight from Russian assets. Smirnov said he spoke to major holders of OFZ bonds about the implications of possible sanctions that could ban foreigners from buying into Russian state debt. He said it was unclear how they would act. OFZ bond holders may also decide to ditch the paper if they lose their high-yielding appeal. This, however, is unlikely to happen this year given the outlook for the central bank's key rate. Smirnov said that the central bank will keep on trimming the key rate this year but it unlikely to cut it to as low as 6.5-7 percent, an area described by the bank's Governor Elvira Nabiullina as neutral for its monetary policy The central bank's key rate is now at 9 percent, far above annual inflation readings that have fallen to the bank's target of 4 percent.  Smirnov also noted that rouble volatility declined to 10-12 percent in the first half of 2017 from around 20 percent seen before. Fluctuations in the rouble rate do not prompt Russian citizens to start frenzied buying of dollars and euros anymore, Smirnov said, adding that households' demand for hard currencies has been recently stable. Smirnov said demand for foreign currency from households last peaked in September when Moscow lifted a ban on charter flights to Turkey, one of the most popular holiday destinations among Russian tourists.

Defense Minister Fikri Isik told Turkish broadcaster NTV that he had not yet seen a request for the closure of the base, but made clear Ankara had no plans to review a 2014 agreement with Qatar which led to it being set up. He was speaking after an official from one of the four Arab states boycotting Qatar over alleged support for terrorism said they had sent Doha a list of 13 demands including closing down the military installation.  If there is such a demand, it will mean interference in bilateral ties,  Isik said, suggesting instead that Turkey might continue to bolster its presence in Qatar. Five armored vehicles and 23 military personnel arrived in Doha on Thursday in a deployment Turkey's armed forces said was  part of a military training and cooperation deal. Some 88 Turkish soldiers were already in Qatar, according to the Hurriyet newspaper. The newspaper said a joint exercise by Turkish and Qatari forces was expected following the Islamic Eid al-Fitr holiday which starts on Sunday, and the number of Turkish soldiers sent to the Gulf state could eventually reach 1,000. An air force contingent was also envisaged, it said. Turkish APC is seen at their military base in Doha, Qatar June 23, 2017. Qatar News Agency/Handout via REUTERS The strengthening of the Turkish base would be a positive step in terms of the Gulf's security,  Isik said.  Re-evaluating the base agreement with Qatar is not on our agenda.  Turkey, which has long tried to play the role of regional mediator, is also wary of upsetting its other allies in the Gulf, including Saudi Arabia, and Isik said Ankara had hoped that tensions over Qatar could be resolved without a crisis. Isik said Turkey's presence in Qatar should be seen as a benefit for the whole Gulf.  The base in Qatar is both a Turkish base and one that will preserve the security of Qatar and the region,  he said. Turkey's military support for Qatar has been matched by stepped up commercial links. Customs and Trade Minister Bulent Tufenkci said Turkish exports to Qatar have tripled since the four Arab countries began boycotting the Gulf state earlier this month.  Since June 5 exports to Qatar have amounted to $32.5 million. Of this $12.5 million is food. This figure is three times the normal level,  Tufenkci told reporters at a Ramadan fast-breaking dinner on Thursday evening. Turkey has sent more than 100 cargo planes of supplies to Qatar but Economy Minister Nihat Zeybekci has said it was not sustainable to maintain supplies through an air lift.

Witnesses said worshippers had spotted the policeman, Mohammed Ayub Pandit, at the mosque in plainclothes, taking photographs of people leaving shortly after midnight.  When they confronted him, a brawl broke out and Ayub fired his gun, wounding three people before the crowd began attacking him, the witnesses said. Two people suspected of involvement in the attack have been arrested, Jammu and Kashmir Director General of Police S. P. Vaid told reporters.  The attack occurred while a separatist leader was speaking inside the mosque amid tight security on Laylat al Qadr, one of the holiest nights of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. The Himalayan region of Kashmir has been divided between India and Pakistan since 1947, and a separatist movement against Indian rule has raged for decades in the Indian part of it. Hostility toward the Indian state, which Kashmiris accuse of widespread rights abuses, often boils over into violence. The last year has seen frequent clashes between security forces and civilian protesters. The beating to death of an officer is unusual, however. Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti said the policeman was at the mosque doing his duty.  This was a shameless act,  Mufti said.

Prices are down a couple of crowns, on average 68 crowns for deliveries in Oslo. It's a little bit difficult today. Nevertheless prices are still very high, too high in our opinion,  the exporter said. Prices peaked at around 80 crowns per kilo in early January before dropping to 50 crowns, but have since rallied. Norway is the world's top salmon exporter, and the share price of listed farming companies depends heavily on changes in the price of fish. Production costs are at around 32-33 crowns per kilo. Supply constraints are expected to support prices in the first half of 2017 before an expected increase in volumes later in the year.

Cruising speed, not acceleration, Morgan Stanley economists said. Surveys of purchasing managers' plans in the euro zone, Germany and France all indicated steady growth, if not perhaps as much as some economists had expected. The broadest of the managers' surveys -- IHS Markit's June flash purchasing managers composite index for the euro zone -- dipped to 55.7 from 56.8 in May. This was lower than anyone in a Reuters economists poll had predicted, but still way above 50, the level Markit says divides expansion from contraction.  Businesses experienced the strongest quarter in six years,  Bert Colijn, ING senior economist for the euro zone, said in a note.  With just a week to go in this quarter, all signs are pointing towards a strong (growth) reading.  At the country level, the most significant development may have been France's manufacturing PMI, which rose far more than expected to 55, rising back after a dip in May possibly because the political risks around the presidential and legislative have gone. Companies also took on workers at the fastest pace in nearly 10 years, a sub-index showed, giving France's new president, Emmanuel Macron, an early economic present. Overall, however, the PMIs showed something of a tailing off of activity -- primarily in services --  even if that was within the context of expansion. Germany's composite index, for example, was down 1.3 points -- from a six-year high -- to a still solid 56.1. Happy Campers The business data came on the heels of Thursday's buoyant euro zone consumer sentiment report. Here again, the news was relative. The actual number was minus 1.3 points, meaning that sentiment is negative. But that is usually the case with the euro zone. So the fact that there was a jump from -3.3 points in May to the highest level in 16 years was seen as a bullish sign.  It all points to labour market wage growth and private consumption,  Berenberg economist Florian Hense said. Other data on Friday, however, showed that the euro zone economy is not without its risks. Italy, the currency bloc's third largest economy, reported a sharp fall in industrial sales and orders in April. The data, which matched industrial output figures released earlier in the month showing a surprise decline, suggests a poor start to the second quarter after 0.4 percent growth in the first. Considered by many economists to be the weak link in the euro zone revival, Italy is facing an election next year at the latest, where the anti-euro, anti-establishment 5-Star Movement is currently seen making gains. The International Monetary Fund projects Italy's economy to grow 1.3 percent this year because of the general euro zone growth picture, but to slow next year.  Weak productivity and low aggregate investment remain key challenges for faster growth, held back by structural weaknesses, high public debt, and impaired bank balance sheets,  the IMF said this month in its latest report.

The increase in CMB's private banking assets, however, will be slower than last year's 33 percent rise to about 1.7 trillion yuan ($243 billion), as the pace of expansion in the overall market eases slightly amid sluggish growth in the world's second-largest economy. China is the biggest private wealth market in Asia Pacific and the second highest globally. Its number of high net worth individuals has risen nearly nine times since a decade ago, a private survey by CMB and consulting firm Bain & Co shows. But many of the rich are increasingly looking overseas to diversify their investments and hedge against a weak domestic yuan currency and, according to the survey, the key destinations are Hong Kong, the United States, Australia and Canada. CMB is planning to open new private banking offices in Sydney and Luxembourg next year, and Los Angeles, London and Vancouver over the next two-three years, Wang Jing，general manger of CMB's private banking department told Reuters. China's sixth-largest lender by assets already has a private banking presence in Hong Kong, New York and Singapore.  We look to serve Chinese clients when they go global and manage their assets worldwide,  Wang said, adding CMB's strong banking relationship with onshore wealthy Chinese clients means it would be in a better position to tap and help manage their offshore investments than foreign wealth managers. CMB has about 60,000 private banking clients with minimum investable assets of 10 million yuan each. While the private banking units of Chinese lenders such as CMB and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Ltd have benefited from the surge in onshore wealth, most global private banks have not been able to cash in as the country's regulatory curbs, dominance of local banks and less developed capital market keep them away. The international firms, instead, have chosen the offshore route to do business with the millionaires spawned by China's booming technology sector and its surging stock market. China saw total investable assets rising 47 percent in 2016 to 165 trillion yuan, the survey shows.  We are quite optimistic about the prospect of China's private wealth market,  Wang said. A strong onshore wealth growth outlook means more staff will be required, on top of roughly 1,400 people CMB currently has globally for the private banking business, but the lack of experienced talent in China is a challenge, she said. CMB's private banking business raked in about 11 billion yuan in revenue last year, or nearly 11 percent of the bank's retail banking revenue. Wang expects this contribution to grow to about 20 percent in the next five years. $1 = 6.8390 Chinese yuan renminbi Reporting by Julie Zhu and Sumeet Chatterjee; Editing by Himani Sarkar","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/chinamrchntbank-wealth-idUSL3N1JK2KU"},

Calculating they can make more money from selling companies an annuity to cover the cost of the pension plans and then invest the proceeds in bonds and other securities, insurers are competing to persuade corporate America to sell them their pension risk. Pension transfers totaling $13.7 billion were finalised last year, up 1 percent from 2015, according to LIMRA, an industry trade group. The figure is the second highest annual total ever recorded, LIMRA said. The average corporate pension fund was 83 percent funded in May, according to Mercer Investment Consulting.

No more.  In the political and market turmoil immediately before and following Britain's decision last June to leave the European Union, financial market investors flipped their long-held bias against the euro and now expect sterling to be the riskier party for years to come. Reuters data going back to 2012 shows three- and five-year risk reversals -- the cost of taking out an option to buy or sell the pound -- have consistently been below zero. That indicated it was almost always more expensive to hedge against the risk of euro exchange rates collapsing than of the same happening in sterling.  There are always blips. On a handful of occasions since Mario Draghi's promise to do  whatever it takes  to prop up the euro in 2012, the single currency has briefly been valued as steadier for the long term. But since an initial jump in the first six months of 2016, both three- and five-year euro-sterling risk reversal contracts have held consistently in positive territory, indicating the tail risk -- the risk of a low probability, high impact event -- is now instead with the pound.  That is the first time in Reuters' historical data on the options market and means it will be increasingly costly for investors exposed to the pound's exchange rate to insure portfolios against further slides.  With the pound pummelled by political and economic uncertainty, the euro/sterling five-year risk reversal on Thursday matched its highest in 11 months, showing an increased bias towards sterling weakness.     This followed open disagreement among Bank of England policymakers on the outlook for interest rates and, by extension, the pound. On Tuesday BoE Governor Mark Carney said now was not the time to raise rates, warning of weak wage growth as Britain prepared to quit the EU. On Wednesday, the central bank's chief economist, Andy Haldane, said he was likely to join those voting for a hike later this year.     Bankers are cautious about predicting further steep falls in the pound, but some senior currency market players wonder what will happen to sterling if Brexit talks turn bad.  Some in the sales teams that focus on selling cheap option plays to hedge fund investors wanting to speculate on currency moves say the change is reflective of the broad swing in political risk.   Risk reversals tend to price fear,  said the head of hedge fund sales with one of the big five international banks who run 40 percent of the $5 trillion a day global currency market.   It is when you are thinking you are going to get a big gap move. And historically the gap move that was on people's minds over the last five years was the euro break-up story. This signals a change in the potential tail risks.  At a time when global measures of volatility are at rock bottom, those in sterling have jumped in the past fortnight, driven initially by a shock electoral turnaround that saw Prime Minister Theresa May deprived of her parliamentary majority.  Analysts say the move in the longer-term risk reversals, however, point to a broader questioning of faith in the pound.   The market is willing to pay a higher premium to hedge against a large sterling depreciation,  said Sam Lynton-Brown, a strategist with BNP Paribas in London.   That is a change.

The transfer includes about $600 million in lump-sum payments to about 7,000 current and former U.S. employees of Accenture and $1 billion in purchases of annuities from insurance companies. U.S. insurers are buying corporate pension plans at a record clip as rising interest rates and all-time high stock-market values give companies the perfect excuse to offload them. Calculating they can make more money from selling companies an annuity to cover the cost of the pension plans and then invest the proceeds in bonds and other securities, insurers are competing to persuade corporate America to sell them their pension risk. Pension transfers totaling $13.7 billion were finalised last year, up 1 percent from 2015, according to LIMRA, an industry trade group. The figure is the second highest annual total ever recorded, LIMRA said. The average corporate pension fund was 83 percent funded in May, according to Mercer Investment Consulting.

But he's not checking the weather or the news, or looking at his email.  I am looking for new cows posted online,  he explains.  Finding cattle to buy - or finding buyers for animals on sale - used to be a difficult business, said the livestock trader.  With large swathes of the country hit by recurring periods of drought, Kenyan herders and farmers are increasingly eager to sell animals when conditions turn worse rather than lose them to insufficient water and pasture. But finding buyers can be a problem, they say, and they often lack good information on what would be a fair price for the animals. Victor Otieno, an animal science graduate of Kenya's Egerton University, said he  once met a farmer who thought she had made an excellent deal selling a cow for 70,000 Kenyan shillings (about $675).   Only we met a neighbor later that day who had just bought the very same cow from the middleman… for 130,000 shillings ($1,250)!  he added. That information gap prompted Otieno in 2015 to set up Cowsoko, an online marketplace for dairy farmers that derives its name from the Swahili word  soko , or market. Sellers can upload a picture of their animal, information on its weight, breed and cost, as well as the seller's details so prospective buyers can contact them directly. They pay an annual fee of 5,000 shillings ($48) to the site, in addition to a fee of 2.5 percent of the cow's selling price. More Options Philip Okech, a consultant at SNV, a Dutch development agency, said farmers often need to travel long distances – up to 100km – to buy or sell animals. Cowsoko encourages sellers to hire a van to deliver sold animals to their buyer within a day of purchase, Otieno said. Payment on the platform is enabled by M-Pesa, a popular mobile money service in Kenya.  Odaga, who so far has bought six cows using the service, said he frequently used to get  tricked by middlemen who would sell me cows at a much higher price than what they had originally bought them for .  And I had to spend even more money to feed the cows or buy drugs because they weren't in good health,  he added.  In addition to problems locating cows for sale or buyers, Otieno said, farmers face another major challenge: finding reliable information on fodder and drugs for the animals.   I noticed  that even once farmers had bought an animal, they knew very little about diseases that might affect them, what feed they should give or what fodder might be available in the area,  he said. With support from experts including SNV, Otieno now has made information on cattle fodder and drugs, as well as potential suppliers, available free on the cow trading platform.  I want farmers to be able to find all the information they need in one place,  he said. Tackling Fraud Not everyone shares Odaga's enthusiasm, however. David Mugambi, a lecturer at Chuka University in Kenya's central Tharaka-Nithi county, warned that fraud is rife on such online trading platforms.  Buyers on these platforms need to be careful as they rarely get to meet the person they're dealing with – the seller – nor do they see the animal physically before buying it, which weakens their negotiating position,  he said.  They also have no control over the delivery time,  said Mugambi.  If the seller delivers the animal later than agreed then there's not much you can do about it.  To curb fraud, Otieno said the platform now only accepts sellers who are registered breeders,  so we can authenticate them . He also introduced the annual membership fee for sellers to dissuade fraudsters, and to be able to trace any transaction back to the seller in case of a dispute. Otieno said he would consider offering a full refund on an animal if needed, although none has been requested to date. He hopes to expand Cowsoko, which currently has about 10,000 users across the country, to neighboring Uganda, Tanzania, Somalia and Ethiopia – and to sell other animals like pigs and poultry.  We have more potential buyers than the platform can accommodate, so we need to grow it and bring more cow sellers on board,  he said.

In a presentation on the economy at a summit of the EU's 28 leaders on Friday, Draghi said the slow price growth meant that the bank's accommodative policy would stay as it is for now, an official with knowledge of Draghi's remarks said. Underlying inflation, the measure of price growth that excludes volatile unprocessed food and energy costs, edged up to 1.2 percent year-on-year in April from 0.8 percent in March, but then eased again to 1.0 percent in May. But Draghi said he expected wage growth to pick up in coming months. Draghi said that sentiment was improving because one of the major uncertainties weighing down confidence last year was dispelled as new hope emerges about the future of the European Union, despite Britain's decision to leave. Draghi quoted U.S. economist Larry Summers, the former top economic adviser to president Barack Obama, that  confidence is the cheapest stimulus . Draghi also told EU leaders that economic growth and improving business climate provided a unique opportunity for politicians to push through structural reforms and start a cycle of enhanced trust and economic convergence.

That was the amount her husband, Odhise, received in a Tirana cafe in July last year to make sure the Supreme Court, where Andrea was a judge, rejected a complaint over ownership of some land near Albania's southern border with Greece. The challenge was duly dismissed, and last week Andrea, 48, became the most senior judge in Albania to be convicted of corruption by her own former colleagues at the Supreme Court. The case has become symbolic of how high bribery has penetrated the echelons of power in Albania, but also of the country's apparent newfound resolve to root it out in pursuit of possible membership talks with the European Union before the year is out. Socialist Prime Minister Edi Rama is seeking re-election on Sunday having brought Albania to the brink of potentially the most significant assault on judicial graft since the Balkan state of three million people emerged from communist isolation in the early 1990s. Shamed and cajoled by the United States and the EU, Albania passed legislation this year designed to end political interference and strengthen the independence of the courts. Its headline measure is a plan, monitored by a panel of EU and U.S. experts, to vet about 1,000 judges and prosecutors to root out those with money and assets beyond the reach of their modest salaries. Those who survive, and new recruits, will see their pay doubled to 150,000 lek ($1,268) per month. If the measures are implemented, Albania – already a member of NATO – hopes to open accession talks with the EU by the end of 2017 – a major step forward for the impoverished region but also useful for the bloc itself as it seeks to show it still intends to grow even after Britain's departure in 2019.  Stopping is not an option,  Rama told Reuters in an interview earlier this month.  We have to do it if we want to be part of the EU.  Cartier The reform follows years of pressure from the EU and the United States, with Washington wildly popular and influential among Albanians, most of whom are Muslims. Since the collapse of a massive Ponzi scheme two decades ago devastated the economy and cast Albania into turmoil, the country has struggled to shake off a reputation for deep-rooted corruption. While some judges flaunt their wealth, others write off luxury villas and apartments as gifts from relatives. Some have been exposed as regularly flying abroad to watch European soccer matches despite their relatively low official incomes.  I'm paid more than them, but some of them drive Audi Q7s (a luxury SUV) while I have a tiny car that breaks down frequently,  said Tirana court reporter Klodiana Lala. FILE PHOTO: Albania's Prime Minister Edi Rama smiles during an interview in Tirana, Albania June 13, 2017.Florion Goga/File PhotoDispensing with diplomatic protocol, U.S. ambassador to Albania Donald Lu told a conference of judges in late 2015:  You should become the new symbol of the system, in place of the image today of corrupt judges wearing Cartier watches.  On paper, the reform scraps the practice of political appointments in the judiciary and makes prosecutors independent.  The influence of politics is minimal,  Socialist lawmaker Fatmir Xhafa, who led the drafting of the legislation with Western guidance, told Reuters. The reform is not cosmetic, he said,  but a radical transformation . Resistance Judges, however, are fighting back and have filed challenges to the reform at the Constitutional Court, which is still to rule on them. Gerd Hoxha, the head of Albania's Union of Judges, said the EU was treating the justice system as if it were at  Year Zero . Reform is necessary, he told Reuters, but the terms of the vetting process were too vague and vulnerable to political bias. The EU's ambassador to Albania, Romana Vlahutin, said the importance of the reform was evident in the  resistance of certain interest groups who are sparing no effort to dilute and weaken it . Others warn that the new system may prove too ambitious.  They have created an enormous structure that will be hard to implement,  said Kathleen Imholz, an Irish-American lawyer based in Albania. Imholz defended the U.S. pressure for reform in Albania.  The Americans have a sincere desire to make the justice system better, with a special investigation/prosecution unit on the FBI model and with corrupt people out of the system,  she told Reuters.  But it ended up being so complicated their goals are like two raisins in a big pudding.      Andrea, the convicted judge, was not in court when the judges issued their verdict. As they did so, they faced a portrait of Mother Teresa of Calcutta - the ethnic Albanian missionary made a saint by the Roman Catholic church - offering a  Prayer for the Judges  imploring them to deliver justice. Andrea, who had pleaded not guilty, was given a four-year suspended sentence and a five-year ban from holding public office. Her husband was jailed for 18 months. Andrea's lawyer has appealed the case to the Constitutional Court. Rama, who is ahead in opinion polls approaching Sunday's parliamentary elections, has accused his rivals of planning to undo the reform, though the main opposition Democratic Party has pledged to move ahead with it if voted into office. In a written statement to Reuters, EU Ambassador Vlahutin said the bloc would closely scrutinize implementation, as it considers whether to open accession talks.   This is not an exercise in ticking a box,  she said. Writing by Matt Robinson; editing by David Stamp","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-albania-election-corruption-idUSKBN19E19H"},

Traffickers operating in border areas are constantly looking for ways to legitimize their business,  said Adrian Phillips of non-profit group Justice and Care, which works on the prosecution of traffickers and care for victims.  Purchase of land using fake documents is ... carried out to gain a foothold, establish support, a base and build a nexus.  Thousands of people – largely poor, rural women and children – are lured to India's towns and cities each year by traffickers who promise good jobs but sell them into prostitution or domestic servitude. West Bengal state - which shares a porous border with poorer neighbors Bangladesh and Nepal and is a known human trafficking hub for that reason - registered more than one-third of the total number of victims in 2016.  A report by Justice and Care and the Indian Border Security Force last month points to specific instances where traffickers on both sides  cement their operations  by buying land in villages close to the India-Bangladesh border and enrolling their names in voters lists in the village councils.  The porous, roughly 2,000 km (1,250 miles) long border running through West Bengal is demarcated primarily by border pillars and meanders through villages, agricultural land and rivers. Every day it is crossed by thousands of people, who share similar ethnic, religious, linguistic and cultural characteristics. These features along with the topography make it easy for infiltrators, smugglers and human traffickers to cross over into India, security officials say.  When traffickers produce valid voter cards or land deeds, it makes surveillance and identification even tougher,  a senior Border Security Force officer told the Thomson Reuters Foundation, declining to be named. India - which has an estimated 40 percent of almost 46 million people enslaved worldwide according to the 2016 Global Slavery Index - is a destination and transit point for young girls and women being trafficked into brothels or domestic servitude. Traffickers are using fake documents to buy land or acquire Indian identity cards, the report said. It gave the example of  Trafficker 1 , a Bangladeshi citizen who had all the necessary Indian identity documents, including a ration card. He had purchased government-owned land and built a house on it, using it as a temporary shelter point for girls being trafficked from Bangladesh. The researchers discovered that more than 35 girls trafficked by the person were working in Mumbai. Describing their journey from their villages in Bangladesh to brothels in India, most trafficking victims said they were  harbored  for a night in a shelter along the border. These mustering points are grooming grounds for the girls who are to be sold to brothels later, the report said.  We are acutely aware of the issues arising from a person having a fake voter card because that is proof of Indian nationality,  said Antara Acharya of the district administration of North 24 Parganas, a border district in West Bengal.  It's not easy when the international border divides a village in two in certain parts but we take up every complaint that comes on a priority basis.

The court decision was the first ruling against Choi Soon-sil, a long-time confidante of the ousted South Korean president, who has been arrested and is being held in jail over the corruption scandal that ended her administration. Prosecutors had demanded a seven-year jail term for Choi on charges of obstruction of business and links to Park in order to force a university to give her daughter preferential treatment. In the sentencing ruling cited by Yonhap, the Seoul Central District Court said it  accepts the evidence that Choi conspired with school officials to give her daughter favors .  Choi violated laws and proper procedures to benefit her daughter,  the court said. Reuters was not able to reach court officials immediately to confirm the report. Choi also faces separate charges, which have yet to be heard, of extortion, abuse of power and attempted fraud to extort bribes from business conglomerates. She and Park have denied all charges against them.

The court also sentenced the president of the university to two years in prison, Yonhap reported.  Choi's 20-year-old daughter, Chung Yoo-ra, an Asian Games equestrian gold medalist, fled to Europe last year. She returned to South Korea earlier this month and claimed that she wanted to clear up any misunderstandings. Her entrance to the university and her high school diploma were canceled after authorities found her high school attendance and test grades had been forged. Prosecutors have twice sought an arrest warrant for Chung to detain her over the corruption scandal, alleging that Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) had provided her with financial assistance to sponsor her equestrian training.  Chung has denied any involvement and had said she was unaware of how Samsung's sponsorship had influenced her equestrian career. However, she later acknowledged during questioning that she knew about Samsung being her patron and that her mother had asked her to keep it secret. The court denied prosecutors' requests to arrest Chung while her mother, Park, and Samsung Group chief Jay Y. Lee were being held in detention. Lee also denies all charges against him.

The plan was made public in newspaper ads on Friday. Under its terms, all creditors will be eligible for an early repayment of their debts to a maximum limit of 50,000 reais ($15,000) each. According to Chief Executive Officer Marco Schroeder, the plan seeks Oi's so-called Classes 1, 3 and 4 of creditors to negotiate ahead of a vote on the carrier's bankruptcy plan. About 53,000 out of Oi's 55,000 creditors can be considered as small creditors, he said. The initiative underscores Schroeder's efforts to untangle a protracted reorganization that has met fierce resistance from creditors and major shareholders. At stake is the recovery of a carrier that employs about 140,000 people and is the only phone company operating in about one-third of Brazil's cities.  This facilitates bankruptcy protection procedures and incentivizes earlier settlements with creditors with smaller accounts receivable,  Schroeder told Reuters. Reuters first reported the plan in November. Largest Reorganization Rio de Janeiro-based Oi filed for bankruptcy protection a year ago on 65.4 billion reais of debt. The carrier's in-court reorganization remains Latin America's biggest ever to date. The amount owed to the targeted members of the three classes is over 800 million reais ($239 million), or just 1.2 percent of Oi's debt under restructuring, Schroeder said. Still, reducing the size of Oi's creditor list could help management focus on negotiating with banks and bondholders, he said. Schroeder said he expects Oi's board to discuss a final, amended restructuring plan  within days or weeks,  before delivering it to creditors. He upheld a September deadline for a creditor vote, which he announced in a June 9 interview. The judge in charge of Oi's bankruptcy protection had backed the plan in December. Oi's two largest groups of creditors did not have an immediate comment on the plan. Initially, creditors owed more than 50,000 reais could get 90 percent of that 10 business days after signing on the plan, and the rest once the bankruptcy court validates Oi's in-court reorganization, Schroeder said. $1 = 3.3412 reais Reporting by Guillermo Parra-Bernal; Editing by Lisa Shumaker","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/oi-sa-restructuring-idUSL1N1JJ00H"},

The central bank kept its benchmark interest rates steady on Friday before the markets opened, saying the current monetary policy was appropriate as it expected the economy to recover in the second half of the year. The spot rupee, which has been trading for five straight sessions after being inactive for six weeks, ended at 153.22/30 per dollar, compared with Thursday's close of 153.15/25. The spot rupee resumed trading on Monday for the first time since May 5 when the central bank had fixed its reference rate at 152.50.  There was (dollar) demand throughout the day and the demand was met by dollar sales by a foreign bank and some inward remittances,  said a currency dealer, requesting anonymity. Dealers said they expect seasonal demand for the dollar to pick up from August. The rupee has been under pressure after the central bank said it would allow gradual depreciation of the currency and set a target of $1.2 billion in direct market purchases of dollars to boost the island nation's reserves this year, mainly to meet a target set by the International Monetary Fund for a three-year $1.5 billion loan. Analysts said the rupee's weakening is a key concern in the future.  If, as we expect, the Fed tightens monetary policy more aggressively than the market expects over the coming months, there is a risk that this could lead to further falls in the (rupee) currency against the U.S. dollar,  Krystal Tan, Asia economist at Capital Economics, said in a research note. The markets will remain closed on Monday for the Islamic Id-Ul-Fitr holiday and trading will resume on Tuesday.

Several of the Toronto-based firm's workers are former employees of First Quantum Minerals, whose prized Kolwezi project was expropriated in 2010 in an episode that underscored the risks of investing in Congo. But for First Cobalt CEO Trent Mell, the logic of entering a country responsible for nearly two thirds of global cobalt output as the electric vehicle market booms is simple.  The bottom line is: No DRC, no Tesla,  he said, referring to the U.S. automaker.  You can't fill the void when you have 64 percent of production coming out of the DRC.  Demand for the metal, a key component in the lithium-ion batteries that power electric cars and mobile phones, is surging. Consultancy CRU Group say electric car and plug-in hybrid vehicle sales could quadruple to 4.4 million in 2021. The market is so promising, Mell said, he is ditching the traditional model of treating cobalt as a by-product of metals such as copper or nickel and is basing investment decisions primarily on sites' cobalt potential.  We apply the lens of our exploration efforts and strategy around where are we going to find cobalt,  he said.  We're able to cross - whether it be cobalt-silver, cobalt-copper, maybe even cobalt-nickel.  CRU consultant Edward Spencer said there was only one active primary cobalt mine, in Morocco, and only a handful of others in development. Cobalt concentrations are typically too low compared with copper or nickel to justify prioritising them. Last month, First Cobalt signed a letter of intent with Madini Minerals, a private Africa-focused mining firm, for a 70 percent controlling interest in seven prospective copper-cobalt properties in southeastern Congo for about $1.6 million. The investments are the first overseas foray by the company, formerly known as Aurgent Resource Corp, after investing this year in a silver and cobalt mine in northern Ontario. Mell said preliminary prospecting would begin in two to three months, though production is at least five years off. 'Unfinished Work' First Cobalt is bucking a trend of western wariness of Congo, now in one of its worst political crises in a generation. President Joseph Kabila's refusal to step down when his mandate expired in December has fuelled rising insecurity in the perpetually unstable country, where millions died in regional conflicts from 1996-2003. The southeastern mining zones near Zambia have been spared the fighting so far, though mining companies there have complained of harassment by revenue-starved taxmen. Last year, Freeport McMoRan sold off its majority stake in the Tenke copper mine, one of the world's largest. It cited a desire to reduce debts, though analysts say the operating environment played an important role in the decision. Chinese investors, including Zijin Mining and China Molybdenum have stepped into the void and now control 43 percent of global refined cobalt material, according to CRU's Spencer. Several First Cobalt workers, including its vice-president for exploration, are intimately familiar with operating in Congo from their time with First Quantum. In 2010, the government expropriated the company's Kolwezi project, in which it had invested $750 million, after a protracted contract review. Mell said that for the former First Quantum staff, their first taste of Congo had only whetted their appetite.  I think they thought they had some unfinished work when they were forced to leave the country,  he said.  This is truly incredible geology. The opportunity for a game-changing discovery in the DRC is hard to replicate elsewhere.

The Boeing 737 MAX 10 will be launched at the Paris Airshow on Monday with the backing of at least two Chinese lessors - CALC and the aviation arm of China Development Bank, whose interest in the aircraft emerged earlier this week. Boeing and CALC declined to comment. CALC's purchase of the newest variant of Boeing's most-sold jet is seen as part of an order for 50 aircraft from the 737 MAX family announced by the Hong Kong leasing firm this week. CALC, part-owned by China Everbright Bank (601818.SS), reported the overall order on Thursday but did not disclose a breakdown by type of model. It is the company's first Boeing order and will diversify its portfolio following previous Airbus purchases. The stock exchange posting on the eve of the world's largest air show is the most concrete sign so far that the widely expected launch of the Boeing 737 MAX 10 is going ahead, subject to the formal approval of Boeing directors. The launch is expected to trigger a procession of roughly 150 mostly small- to medium-sized orders from airlines, industry sources said. These include low-cost operators Lion Air of Indonesia and India's Spicejet. Ireland's Ryanair (RYA.I) has confirmed it is looking at the jet, but is not expected to strike a deal in time for the show. Expectations were diminishing as the show approached of an order for the jet from United Airlines (UAL.N), which Boeing had been actively wooing as a marquee customer. The 190-230-seat Boeing 737 MAX 10 is designed to plug a gap at the top end of Boeing's single-aisle range after strong sales of the competing Airbus A321neo. It will be delivered from 2020. Boeing and Airbus are preparing to squeeze the last drop out of a recent flood of airplane orders without the razzmatazz of recent years at the show starting on Monday. As often happens when markets soften, leasing companies will be looking for bargains in Paris next week and are expected to feature prominently in any announcements beyond the MAX 10. A handful of airlines were said to be shopping for planes in advance of the show including Peruvian low-cost startup Viva Air, owned by Irelandia Aviation led by the son of Ryanair founder Tony Ryan, which could place an order for Airbus. Saudia budget subsidiary Flyadeal, which has already leased Airbus jets, could soon opt to buy some, industry sources said. Airbus declined comment. Neither airline could be reached.

Pittsburgh dropped three consecutive 2-1 decisions in St. Louis when the National League Central rivals met in April. Pittsburgh sustained consecutive losses to split its four-game series at Milwaukee to fall to 3-5 on the heels of a season-high four-game winning streak. Gregory Polanco highlighted his fourth multi-hit performance in six games with a solo homer in Thursday's 4-2 loss to the Brewers, but is just 3-for-14 in his career against Friday starter Adam Wainwright. St. Louis rookie Paul DeJong also went deep in Thursday's 5-1 loss to Philadelphia, extending his team's home run streak to 11 straight games - with 20 coming since last Friday.

I think they're looking for fastballs early, and then some breaking balls didn't work his way at all,  manager Clint Hurdle said of the 25-year-old. Taillon permitted two runs in five innings of a no-decision versus St. Louis on Sept. 7 last season. Wainwright surrendered nine runs on seven hits for the second time in three starts on Saturday, lasting a career-low 1 2/3 innings in a 15-7 rout at Baltimore. The 35-year-old surrendered three homers in that contest after being taken deep just five times in his previous 13 games. A trip back to Busch Stadium could be what the doctor ordered for Wainwright, who owns a 5-1 mark with a 2.88 ERA in seven home starts this season. Walk-Offs 1.

The NL East-leading Nationals will try to find more consistent offense starting Friday when they host the opener of a three-game set against the Cincinnati Reds, who own the worst pitching in the majors. Since matching its high-water mark of the season at 17 games over .500 with a June 8 win over Baltimore, Washington has faced four teams with losing records and pitching staffs that rank in the bottom half of the majors in ERA. Over that 13-game stretch, the Nationals have either scored three runs or fewer (six times) or at least seven (seven times) - a level of inconsistency which has contributed to their 5-8 mark since beating the Orioles. While wins have been hard to come by of late for Washington, they have been virtually nonexistent for the Reds (30-41), who have dropped 11 of 12 overall to fall a season-worst 11 games below .500.

Castillo, who is 21-22 with a 2.66 ERA in 169 appearances (54 starts) over his minor-league career, has surrendered only five homers and yielded two runs or fewer in 12 of his 14 outings this season. Strasburg rebounded from his worst start of the season with a road win Saturday against the New York Mets, allowing two runs on six hits while fanning five across 5 1/3 innings. The two-time All-Star has endured a mediocre June (2-1, 4.24 ERA) after cruising through May (4-0, 2.78) and struggled at home (2-1, 4.15) much more than on the road (6-1, 2.61). Joey Votto is 3-for-11 with two homers against Strasburg, who is 2-1 with a 4.35 ERA in six starts versus the Reds. Walk-Offs 1.

Lugo lost his only career outing against the Giants on Aug. 19, when he gave up three runs and seven hits in 6 2/3 innings at San Francisco. Blach's winless streak reached three starts on Sunday as he allowed three runs and seven hits in 6 2/3 innings of a no-decision at Colorado. It was a step in the right direction for the 26-year-old native of Denver, however, as he surrendered 12 runs and 19 hits over 11 2/3 frames in his previous two turns - both losses.

Arizona has erupted for 26 runs in its last two contests and enjoyed a 15-9 edge in last week's series versus Philadelphia, although manager Pete Mackanin's club has won each of the last four games in Phoenix. Recent history, however, hasn't been kind to the Phillies, who posted just their second win in 15 outings with a 5-1 triumph over St. Louis on Thursday. TV: 9:40 p.m. ET, CSN Philadelphia, FSN Arizona PITCHING MATCHUP: Phillies RH Mark Leiter Jr. (0-0, 4.74 ERA) vs. Diamondbacks LH Patrick Corbin (6-6, 5.19) Leiter will be making his first career start in the majors after allowing 12 runs and 14 walks in 12 relief appearances this season. The 26-year-old posted a 1-0 mark in five trips to the mound - including three starts - with Triple-A Lehigh Valley before rejoining the Phillies on Thursday. Leiter's last two appearances with Philadelphia didn't go so well, as he permitted five runs on four hits in two-thirds of an inning against Miami on May 30 before walking three batters in his next stint versus San Francisco three days later. Corbin answered a rough patch by winning his second straight start last Friday after yielding two earned runs on five hits in six innings of a 5-4 victory over Philadelphia. The 27-year-old permitted five runs total in his last two starts after being shredded for 12 earned runs on 19 hits in his previous two - both losses. Corbin was taken deep by Cameron Rupp in his last outing after surrendering 11 homers in a six-start stretch spanning all of May into early June. Walk-Offs 1. Arizona 1B Paul Goldschmidt has recorded four three-hit performances in his last nine games and went 5-for-15 with a home and four RBIs in three contests versus Philadelphia. 2. Phillies RHP Pat Neshek extended his scoreless innings streak to 15 innings on Thursday. 3. Philadelphia CF Odubel Herrera's 16 extra-base hits in June are the highest monthly total on the team since Dominic Brown collected 17 in May 2013.

The sensors are leading Big Oil's mining of so-called big data, with some firms envisioning billions of dollars in savings over time by avoiding outages, managing supplies and identifying safety hazards. The industry has long used sophisticated technologies to find oil and gas. But only recently have oil firms pooled data from across the company for wider operating efficiencies - one of many cost-cutting efforts spurred by the two-year downturn in crude oil prices. ConocoPhillips says that sensors scattered across its well fields helped it halve the time it once took to drill new wells in Eagle Ford shale basin of South Texas. By comparing data from hundreds of sensors, its program automatically adjusts the weight placed on a drill bit and its speed, accelerating the extraction of oil, said Matt Fox, ConocoPhillips' executive vice president for strategy, exploration and technology. It is just one application, but if applied to the more than 3,000 wells ConocoPhillips hopes to drill in the Texas basin, those small sensors could lead to  billions and billions of dollars  in savings, Fox said in an interview.  We started using data analytics in our Eagle Ford business,  he said.  And everywhere we look there are applications for this.  The cost and complexity of such systems vary widely. Oil giants such as ConocoPhillips buy a mix of off-the-shelf and custom programs, along with data repositories. The Houston-based producer's employees use Tibco Software Inc's Spotfire data visualization package to analyze information from well sites. Tibco declined to discuss its pricing. Services firms including Schlumberger NV and General Electric Co oil and gas unit sell sensor-equipped gear, data repositories and software to improve producers' decision-making. Back when oil traded at more than $100 a barrel - before the price crash in 2014 - data analysis was an  afterthought  for most oil firms, said Binu Mathew, who oversees digital products at GE Oil & Gas. Now - with prices at about $43 a barrel after recovering from a low of about $26 in early 2016 -  the efficiency aspect is far, far more important,  Mathew said. Finding Hidden Value A survey by Ernst & Young last year examined 75 large oil and gas companies and found that 68 percent of them had invested more than $100 million each in data analytics during the past two years. Nearly three quarters of those firms planned to allocate between 6 and 10 percent of their capital budgets to digital technology, the survey found. Effectively mining large data sets could lead to supplanting workers with artificial intelligence and machine learning systems, according to firms selling and buying data-driven technology. Simple sensors already increase safety and savings by eliminating the need to send workers to rigs or production facilities to gather data. Automating drilling decisions can produce more consistent results by cutting out human errors, said Duane Cuku, vice president of sales for rig technology at Precision Drilling Corp.  The driller is now able to focus his attention on the well - and the performance and safety of his crews - as opposed to the manual manipulation of controls,  Cuku said. Occidental Petroleum Corp also uses an analytical tool to find the best design for hydraulic fracturing wells. A new version of the software analyzes data on well completions and geology to recommend whether injecting steam or water would produce more oil. Abhishek Gaurav, a petroleum engineer for closely-held Texas Standard Oil, said he uses big-data analytics to help his company choose which properties to explore. Using Spotfire, the same program utilized by Conoco, Standard applies a combination of data science and petroleum engineering to rank asking prices for land based on a variety of completion, production and geological variables - such as the amount of sand that likely would be required to complete a well in a given formation. The technique, Gaurav said, has reduced the time needed for evaluating land parcels from weeks to hours - and resulted in better decisions.  We found value in properties when many other teams did not,  he said. Recruiting in California Some of the information craved by oil firms isn't so easy to gather or analyze. Surveys and maps that companies use to acquire acreage for drilling, for instance, are often not digitized. Older company data on wells may be unstructured or spread among suppliers using different storage formats, making integration and analysis a challenge. General Electric and its oil-and-gas unit are moving aggressively into the business of digitizing industrial equipment for other firms, and have invested in large data processing centers for energy clients. GE sees huge potential for market growth: A company study estimated that only 3 percent to 5 percent of oil and gas equipment is connected digitally, and less than one percent of the data collected gets used for decision-making, the study found. Getting the industry more fully connected will take time.  There is a huge amount of data prep, data sanitization and data extraction needed for big data to be totally disruptive,  said Kate Richard, chief executive at private equity investor Warwick Energy. She projects a major payoff from the technology is still five or ten years away. Oklahoma City-based Warwick - which manages interests in thousands of wells across Oklahoma and Texas - is preparing for that payoff by hiring people from tech hubs in California, Richard said.  They all have computer programming and data science backgrounds,  she said.

Team owners confirmed her exit on Wednesday, citing  diverging views of the future of the company , while board chairman Pascal Picci denied speculation that her departure concerned the status of their drivers and a desire to favor Sweden's Ericsson.  For me and Pascal it has been very clear it is not the case,  Ericsson said on Thursday, addressing the suggestion that Kaltenborn had departed the Swiss-based team due to favoritism ahead of this weekend's Azerbaijan Grand Prix.   We have both been given equal equipment and priorities, and that's how it's always been in this team and will always be.  It's all been quite sudden, in the last 48 hours it's all been happening,  he continued.  It's quite a new thing for me as a driver as well.

Wehrlein echoed his team mate's surprise at the departure of Kaltenborn, who previously held a 33.3 percent stake in the team before it was taken over by Longbow Finance S.A. last year.  I was very surprised,  the German driver said.  I spoke with Monisha on Tuesday evening, she called me and she told me about it, and of course I was really surprised about it.   Obviously everyone is asking questions. If it's good or bad or what has changed in the team. I think the drivers are not the right person to comment too much on it.   I am just doing my job and I want to perform as good as I can, and everything about this is not part of my job.  Kaltenborn joined Sauber in 2000 to run the legal department and took over as chief executive in 2010. While the team fell on hard times in recent seasons, their financial problems eased when Swiss-based investment company Longbow took over last July.

KIRS Group, the UK's leading diversified independent insurance intermediary, has been formed by combining the businesses of Towergate (KIRS Finco plc), with Direct Group, Price Forbes, Chase Templeton and Autonet. Simultaneously, we have affirmed KIRS Finco plc's IDR at 'B-' with Stable Outlook and withdrawn the rating as its debt has been repaid. The rating is constrained by a mature UK insurance market, negative 2017 free cash flow (FCF) and execution risk related to the expected full delivery of the Towergate transformation plan. The rating is supported by the enhanced market position and product diversity of the combined group, improved liquidity and strong shareholder support. A full list of rating actions is available below. KEY RATING DRIVERS Mature UK Market May Moderate Growth: Fitch believes the management team has demonstrated the knowledge and skillset to execute the Towergate transformation plan. However, risks remain in delivering this plan in a highly competitive insurance and brokerage market. The UK non-life insurance broker market is likely to experience limited organic growth over the next four years. In addition, KIRS Group may not be able to continue to attract or retain the skilled employees required to realise these plans or the employees may not deliver as expected.  However, this is offset by significantly reduced employee turnover and new revenue-focused hires. There is also potential for disruption from digital technology and disintermediation, which is partly offset through the acquisition of Autonet and KIRS Group's multiple distribution channels. Acquisition Adds Scale and Diversity: The proposed transaction will enhance the scale and diversity of the legacy Towergate business and reinforce its position as the leading diversified independent insurance intermediary in the UK. This will allow KIRS Group to leverage multiple distribution channels to access each of its customer segments with a broad product portfolio. In addition, with a product portfolio targeting segments such as SME, automotive, and health insurance, there is the potential to reduce earnings volatility and through a more integrated approach, to capture a greater proportion of potential revenue. Leverage and FCF Show Positive Trend: The transaction will materially deleverage the group from the historical Towergate capital structure. In particular, funds from operations (FFO) adjusted gross leverage is likely to decline to 7.6x for KIRS Group in 2017 from over 9.0x for Towergate in 2016. Operational improvements and the delivery of the transformation plan will lead to deleveraging, sales growth and FCF improvement. However, KIRS Group's FCF is expected to remain negative in 2017, before trending towards positive territory by 2018. Liquidity risk from negative FCF is mitigated by on balance sheet cash and the addition of a GBP90 million super senior revolving credit facility (RCF). Transformation Programme Has Stabilised Towergate: KIRS Group's Towergate subsidiary has been going through restructuring for the past two years and it has utilised a transformation plan to deliver operational and financial improvements. Towergate has made significant progress on the transformation plan, exceptional items remain and the full annualised benefits will not be realised until 2018 or later. However, it is our view that substantially all of the expense components of the plan have been completed and that management can dedicate increasing resources to developing the strategy around KIRS Group. Support from Shareholders and Regulators Key: Shareholders have invested approximately GBP680 million in KIRS Group and have demonstrated their support both through transactions to provide liquidity to Towergate during the transformation plan and by financing the acquisitions to form KIRS Group. Continued shareholder support is a positive factor for the group. In addition, given that Towergate is regulated by the FCA, it is credit-positive that the FCA has been involved from the outset of the process and remains supportive of the proposed new group. This is an essential component of delivering the proposed transaction. DERIVATION SUMMARY KIRS Group has a significantly smaller scale than its insurance broker peers rated by Fitch and has a less diverse product line. Its expertise in niche, high margin product lines and its leading position among UK insurance brokers underpin a sustainable business model, but its higher financial risk and underperforming business lines constrain the rating. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: - Sales grow at 2% in 2017 trending towards 6%-7% in 2019-2020; - EBITDA margins grow from 22.4% in 2017 to approximately 29% in 2020; - Capex includes maintenance of 2% per year and growth capex of GBP60 million in total; - Exceptional items include regulatory fees and expenses as well as costs related to the transformation plan. KEY ASSUMPTIONS FOR BESPOKE RECOVERY ANALYSIS - The post-restructuring EBITDA is 10% below Fitch's 2017 forecast EBITDA. This reflects a hypothetical contraction which would provoke a default as well as Fitch's expectation of corrective actions. - 5.5x distressed multiple reflects KIRS Group's strong market position and diversified business profile. - 10% of going concern enterprise value is deducted for administrative claims. - RCF is assumed to be fully drawn upon default. The RCF is super senior to the senior secured notes. RATING SENSITIVITIES Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action -FFO gross adjusted leverage below 6.5x. -FFO fixed charge coverage above 2.5x. -EBITDA margins sustainably above 25% and trending towards 30%. -Successful integration of KIRS Group. Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action -FFO gross adjusted leverage above 8x; -Persistently negative FCF with FFO fixed charge coverage below 1.5x; -Failure of the transformation plan to deliver expected savings with EBITDA margins below 20%; -Total liquidity below GBP20 million; -Evidence that shareholders no longer support the business. LIQUIDITY RCF Provides Sustainable Liquidity: The transaction will result in GBP42 million on-balance sheet cash. In addition, KIRS Group will have a GBP90 million RCF and no near-term maturities. We expect this to be sufficient to cover negative FCF in 2017 related to the delivery of the transformation plan and other business investments. Fitch expects positive FCF from 2018 to 2020.

Crude oil pulled away from this week's 10-month lows, although prices were still set for their worst first-half performance since 1997. The slide in energy prices has worsened the outlook for inflation creating a headache for the world's major central banks looking to normalise rates after years of ultra-loose policy.  (The) oil price is the 'poster child' for victory of deflation,  analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAML) said in a note of weekly investment flows. Investors were beginning to shift allocations accordingly and moving out of assets typically in favour when prices are rising such as inflation-protected U.S. Treasury funds and bank loans. Elsewhere inflows into equities slowed with some investors moving into laggard energy shares, BAML said. European shares fell 0.5 percent while MSCI's gauge of world stocks slipped 0.1 percent. Oil prices edged up on Friday, recovering some of their steep losses made this week, but the outlook for the commodity remains cloudy as production cuts have failed to sufficiently reduce oversupply. In currency markets, Friday's bounce in oil helped commodity currencies such as the Canadian dollar. The dollar weakened against a basket of major currencies and is now down more than 0.5 percent since this week's earlier highs as doubts about how quickly the Fed will be able to raise rates crept in. The dollar peaked at a one-month high on Tuesday after the Federal Reserve hiked interest rates last week and left the door open for further monetary tightening later in the year. But it has been stuck in a tight range since, awaiting fresh catalysts.  For the dollar we’re in a waiting game until September,  said Trum.  In our view they’ll then hike interest rates but then start to talk about the inflation rate - if that doesn't start to go up then future hikes will become more difficult.  In Britain, on the one-year anniversary of last year's shock Brexit referendum in which Britons voted to leave the EU, sterling extended gains. The pound rose 0.37 percent against the dollar following more comments from Bank of England policymakers calling for a rate hike.

The payment, which will be divided among the 10 families, comes some nine months after Israel, which had already offered apologies for the raid - one of Ankara's conditions for rapprochement - agreed to pay the families of those killed.  Compensation has been paid to the families of those who lost their lives during the Mavi Marmara attack,  Turkish broadcasters quoted Agbal as saying. Relations between Israel and Turkey broke down in 2010 when Turkish pro-Palestinian activists were killed by Israeli commandos enforcing a naval blockade of the Gaza Strip. The soldiers raided a ship, the Mavi Marmara, leading a flotilla towards the Islamist Hamas-run Palestinian territory. In June 2016 however, the two countries said they would normalize relations - a rapprochement driven by the prospect of lucrative Mediterranean gas deals as well as mutual fears over security risks in the Middle East.  Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan named a new ambassador to Israel in November last year, reciprocating a move by the Israelis, in a move toward restoring diplomatic ties between the once-close allies.

Selected executives are being sent deceptively real-looking  spear-phishing  emails. They claim to have noticed irregularities in the use of the inbox or offer new security functions, the BSI said in a statement. Germany is heading for elections in September, and security experts have warned that officials might face cyber attacks like those that occurred before elections in France and the United States over the past year. The attacks identified by BSI ask users to click on a link and put their passwords into the website that then opens. If they do, the attackers can get access to their personal inbox. Yahoo and Gmail accounts were targeted in the attacks. The BSI said it had prevented an attack on the government networks. BSI President Arne Schoenbohm said the BSI generally could detect such phishing attempts, but private email inboxes were beyond its remit, which made them an attractive target.  The attack infrastructure used is similar to that used in the attacks on and resulting leaks from the Democrats in the U.S. and against the French En Marche movement,  the BSI said. U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded Russia orchestrated a wide-ranging influence operation that included email hacking and online propaganda, in an effort to discredit presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and help Donald Trump win the White House in November. The German government has warned political parties to step up their defences against hacking after emails from the campaign of Emmanuel Macron were leaked just before he was elected president of France.

Once considered one of the most promising emerging markets, Nigeria was hammered when it introduced draconian foreign exchange restrictions to counter the effects of the 2014 oil price crash. These will take years to unwind, some analysts fear, while others are concerned the new trading facility could come under pressure if oil prices were to take another tumble, or trade through it could slow if Nigeria's currency reserves run low. The much-criticised move starved the economy of dollars, throttled foreign investment and plunged Africa's largest economy into recession for the first time in more than 25 years. But authorities have since tried to normalise the currency market and alleviate dollar shortages, most recently via the  Investors & Exporters FX Window , which allows investors and traders to swap nairas for dollars at market-determined rates. The new window adds to a confusing array of exchange rates. But it does seem to be succeeding in luring back some foreign funds, especially as the economy should return to growth soon and inflation is finally slowing.  It is a very good thing. Obviously having multiple exchange rates is not an optimum situation yet, but it is moving towards a more realistic exchange rate,  said Oliver Weeks, economist at hedge fund Emso Asset Management.  This certainly makes the country more interesting.  Under the new system, in place since April, the opening and closing naira/dollar rates are determined by a poll of authorised bank dealers. The NAFEX or Nigerian Autonomous Foreign Exchange Rate Fixing is set around noon and serves as a benchmark for derivatives such as forwards and futures. Weeks said Emso has used the new mechanism successfully several times in the past six weeks. Since the window's launch, foreigners have swapped some $2.2 billion through it, according to the central bank although London-based Exotix Capital said many of the deals were likely small as some people test the new system. Data from Lagos-based FMDQ OTC Securities Exchange, which hosts the window, shows the naira NAFEX fix at nearly 369 per dollar, well below the official 305 rate the central bank had previously clung to. Sola David-Borha, Chief Executive Africa Regions at Standard Bank - one of the authorised dealers in the new window - said the window was working  reasonably well  and there was definitely liquidity.  But the most important thing is that the central bank is willing to engage, and there is constant engagement now with bankers, investors and other stakeholders,  David-Borha said. Stocks Race Up The Lagos stock market has climbed nearly a third in the past six weeks and trading volumes have more than doubled. Local bonds, some paying yields over 20 percent are also luring more foreign investors, local traders said The new window has re-opened the doors to the carry trade in naira - one of the few such opportunities on the continent outside South Africa, said Yvette Babb, executive director for sub-Saharan Africa research and strategy at J.P Morgan. Babb estimates foreign portfolio outflows from Nigeria were around $6 billion last year, but added:  Depressed equity prices and high local currency yields in combination with the exchange rate adjustment is likely to give rise to further foreign portfolio inflows.  But NAFEX still has plenty of critics. Above all, investors are worried by authorities' failure to guarantee that the window will remain available in future, especially in the event of another sharp decline in oil prices. Secondly, the central bank sold more than $4 billion from February to May to narrow the gap between the official and black market exchange rates. But with reserves of just over $30 billion, it is doubtful it can keep selling at such a pace.  In the case of oil production coming down again, it is not clear that the currency will adjust and you could go back to a position where the market goes completely illiquid again,  Emso's Weeks said. And those betting that NAFEX heralds a swift and full-fledged naira liberalisation may be disappointed. Although an exporter of oil, Nigeria's reliance on imports for fuels such as gasoline is a drain on foreign exchange. The government has pledged to end its reliance on oil product imports by 2019 - and the two are connected, Babb said.  Markets are expecting more exchange rate liberalization in the next six months, but policymakers seem to be seeking convergence by 2019,  Babb added. So more conservative investors are holding back. For instance Guy Tossou, portfolio manager for emerging markets fixed income at BNP Paribas Asset Management, is waiting for a functioning naira market to return but says it is inevitable.  They are getting there, but it is a slow pace in Nigeria because the social impact will be negative. But I don't think they have any choice.

Washington sees the YPG as an essential ally in the campaign to defeat Islamic State in its Raqqa stronghold. Ankara considers it a terrorist group tied to militants who have fought an insurgency in southeast Turkey since the mid-1980s. Turkish Defense Minister Fikri Isik told broadcaster NTV a letter sent to him by U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis regarding the weapons given to the YPG was a  positive step  but  implementation is essential . Turkey has said supplies to the YPG have in the past ended up in PKK hands, describing any weapon given to them as a threat to its security. Isik warned of retaliation for any action by the Syrian militia.  Any move by the YPG toward Turkey will be answered immediately,  the minister said.  Threats that might emerge after the Raqqa operation are already being evaluated. We will implement steps that will completely secure the border,  he added.  It is Turkey's right to eliminate terror threats across its borders . The fight for Raqqa began two weeks ago, putting pressure on Islamic State, which also faces defeat in its Iraqi stronghold, Mosul. The British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said on Wednesday Turkey had sent reinforcements, including troops, vehicles and equipment into Syria, toward areas south of Azaz town, which is held by Turkish-backed Syrian rebels. The YPG controls areas south of Azaz. A rebel from a Turkish-backed group has also said Turkey sent in more forces but there has been no confirmation from officials in Ankara. Turkey opened an offensive in northern Syria in August last year, sending tanks and warplanes across the border to support Syrian rebels fighting both Islamic State and the YPG. It helped them carve out a big portion of northern Syria, helping ensure the YPG and its allies could not link the 400-km (250-mile) stretch of territory they hold in the north and northeast with the pocket they hold west of Azaz.

China's internet shares tumbled after news of the unusually harsh clamp down spread, with Weibo Corp's (WB.O) down 6.1 percent, while SINA Corp (SINA.O), which has a stake in Weibo, fell 4.8 percent. That amounted to a combined $1.3 billion knock to the market value of both companies. The Twitter-like service Sina Weibo, popular online video site ACFUN and news portal iFeng.com will have to stop video streaming services that violate the country's regulations, the TV and film watchdog said on Thursday.  This will provide a clean and clear Internet space for the wide number of online users,  the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television said in a brief statement on its website. While the move is likely to send a chill through China's booming online entertainment industry, analysts expect the country's social media providers will be able to adjust to a tougher regulatory environment although with more limited content offerings. Beijing tightly controls its internet space and bans content that it deems politically threatening or damaging to China's national identity. It has increasingly taken aim at the country's booming internet industry.  The TV and film watchdog did not give a timeline for the ban, but analysts say it is more than likely the services will open again with beefed-up oversight.  Instead of a slap on the wrist, it's a slap all the way up the arm, the neck and the head. But it's still a slap, it's not a kill shot,  said Beijing-based director of Marbridge Consulting Mark Natkin. Sina Weibo's booth is pictured at the Global Mobile Internet Conference (GMIC) 2017 in Beijing, China April 28, 2017.Jason LeeIt follows the controversial shuttering of 60 popular celebrity gossip social media accounts last week by China's cyberspace authorities, who said the sites catered to poor tastes and did not  actively propagate core socialist values . In May, it released regulations for online news sites and network portals that expanded restrictions on content and required all services to be overseen by party-sanctioned editorial staff. Several online video portals, including iFeng, have been publicly reprimanded in the last six months for conducting live-streamed interviews and other news gathering activities without state authorization.  I think this [recent] ban is much more serious than the ones before,  a former iFeng employee, who worked at the firm until recently and declined to be identified, told Reuters.   The video department is a very important part of (iFeng). When the live stream service was reprimanded previously, it was a great blow. Now, they will feel even more nervous.  iFeng.com did not respond to a request for comment while ACFUN released a statement on social media saying it would attempt to remedy the issues. Weibo said it was communicating with relevant government authorities to understand the scope of the notice. Users of the video sites took to Weibo's microblog on Friday to share their frustration.   In general, I think the network does require some governance,  said one commenter.  But the way they are doing it just shouldn't be so absolute.

The investment follows news this week that Noble had gained an extension on a key debt deadline and was in  constructive  talks with potential investors, although it also pushed back payment of a coupon on a closely watched bond. The equity fund, Goldilocks Investment Co, said in a filing it had bought the stake in purchases on Monday and Tuesday for almost S$31 million ($22.3 million). Noble's stock jumped 16.5 percent on Friday to S$0.53, taking this week's gains to 63 percent. Even so, the stock is still down some 70 percent this year. Abu Dhabi Financial Group, which has more than $5 billion in assets under management, was not immediately available for comment. Noble declined to comment. Questions over its accounting and a sharp downturn in commodity markets since 2012 have left Noble struggling to meet its debt obligations, forcing it to dramatically reduce the scale of its operations. The company, which has stood by its accounts, has also been buffeted by credit downgrades, management upheavals and a series of writedowns and asset sales. Separately, Fitch Ratings said it downgraded Noble's credit rating to CCC from B-. Standard and Poor's as well as Moody's have also been further cutting their ratings on Noble in recent months.  The downgrade follows continued uncertainty regarding Noble's funding capacity and how this will affect its operation at its current business scale,  Fitch said after trading hours on Friday. It said the extension of the loan deadline did not provide evidence of medium-term funding stabilisation. Jingyi Pan, a market strategist at IG Asia, said that while Goldilocks' stake purchase would provide some confidence in Noble in the short term, the impact would be limited.  I see that investors could be invested in the near term because of the extension, but in the longer term, you have to depend on how (Noble's) restructuring and profitability would be,  she said. The $200 million Goldilocks fund was launched last October with the aim of taking minority stakes in companies and helping them to restructure and develop. Noble also said this week that it had sold its 45 percent stake in an Indonesian joint venture, which provides coal logistics services, for $1.00. $1 = 1.3893 Singapore dollars Reporting by Aradhana Aravindan; Editing by Edwina Gibbs and Christopher Cushing","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/noble-stocks-idUSL3N1JK1PY"},

China claims most of the energy-rich sea through which about $5 trillion in ship-borne trade passes every year, much of it to and from Japanese ports. Neighbors Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam also have claims. Japan worries that China is cementing its control in the South China Sea with manmade island bases, arms sales and development aid.  We are not just here to show our presence, but from the outside that is what it looks like,  Rear Admiral Yoshihiro Goga, the commander of the mission, said aboard the Izumo-class helicopter carrier. Military officers from the ten-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) boarded the 248-metre carrier in Singapore on Monday. It returned on Friday after demonstrating naval skills and kit Tokyo hopes will help it bolster alliances in the region. The Izumo turned back to Singapore before crossing a boundary known as the nine-dash-line into what China claims are its waters.

Picture taken June 21, 2017.Nobuhiro KuboThe high-profile cruise was part of a hitherto unseen coordinated push by Japan's Self Defense Forces and defense bureaucrats to bolster ties with countries ringing the contested waters. It also marked a concerted push into military diplomacy by hawkish Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.  Japan last week held a military technology seminar near Tokyo for representatives from Thailand, Vietnam, the Philippines, Indonesia and Singapore and this week invited ASEAN officers to a disaster relief drill in Tokyo.  Slideshow (3 Images)Abe's government believes Japan may be better placed to prise Southeast Asian nations away from Chinese influence than its U.S. allies with a gentler approach that emphasizes a common Asian heritage, two sources with knowledge of the diplomatic strategy told Reuters earlier.  While the U.S. has confronted China directly by sending warships close to China's island bases in the South China Sea, Japan so far has shied away from similar provocations. As the Izumo neared the nine-dash line, the crew were on lookout for Chinese aircraft or ships sent to shadow the flag ship. Apart from brief radar contact with an unidentified aircraft  announced by the ship's public address system the carrier, however, sailed on unmolested.

Globally equities attracted just $500 million in the week to Wednesday as the heavy outflows from U.S. stocks offset $2.1 billion of inflows to emerging markets and $1.1 billion of inflows to European stocks. Bonds attracted $5 billion globally, with $3.3 billion injected into investment grade bonds, $1.1 billion into high yield and $1.9 billion into emerging market debt funds. While BAML said  irrational sentiment  was confined to tech stocks, corporate bonds and emerging debt, it is sticking with its view that an Icarus-style climb will be followed by a Humpty Dumpty-like fall in the autumn. The S&P; 500 has climbed to record highs this week with tech stocks rebounding from recent declines, helped by Amazon buying upscale grocer Whole Foods Market. Inflows to tech funds in 2017 are growing at their fastest annualised rate in 15 years - equivalent to 21 percent of assets under management, the bank's analysts noted. But some investors are getting cold feet, with $200 million pulled from tech funds in the week to Wednesday, BAML data showed, the first tech outflows in 16 weeks. BAML cited several signs of Wall Street excess, not least the fact that Facebook's market cap now exceeds the market cap of MSCI India. The bank also highlighted a record high global issuance of high yield bonds, whilst Argentina has just issued a 100-year bond. This is a country  that has spent 33 percent of the past 200 years in default and has defaulted three times in the past 23 years,  BAML said. In another classic late-cycle signal, global investors are long eurozone equities, it added, with the bank's June fund manager survey showing the third largest overweight on record.  Central banks, the reason behind high asset prices and low volatility are now in a desperate dilemma,  BAML said.  (It's) politically unacceptable for a bubble on Wall Street, but central banks will be tightening into deflation; the inflection point for volatility is upon us and we recommend investors buy volatility.

Selected executives are being sent deceptively real-looking  spear-phishing  emails. They claim to have noticed irregularities in the use of the inbox or offer new security functions, the BSI said in a statement. Germany is heading for elections in September, and security experts have warned that officials might face cyber attacks like those that occurred before elections in France and the United States over the past year. The attacks identified by BSI ask users to click on a link and put their passwords into the website that then opens. If they do, the attackers can get access to their personal inbox. Yahoo and Gmail accounts were targeted in the attacks. The BSI said it had prevented an attack on the government networks. BSI President Arne Schoenbohm said the BSI generally could detect such phishing attempts, but private email inboxes were beyond its remit, which made them an attractive target.  The attack infrastructure used is similar to that used in the attacks on and resulting leaks from the Democrats in the U.S. and against the French En Marche movement,  the BSI said. U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded Russia orchestrated a wide-ranging influence operation that included email hacking and online propaganda, in an effort to discredit presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and help Donald Trump win the White House in November.

The regulator also said it had granted a licence to a new locally owned bank, Mayfair Bank Limited, the second such licence since 2015, when it imposed a moratorium on approving new lenders. The central bank gave no reason for the suspension of licensing, but it came after it had placed Imperial Bank under receivership in October 2015, following the board of the privately owned mid-sized lender alerting it to suspected malpractices. The Imperial Bank receivership rattled confidence in a financial sector where more than 40 foreign and local banks operate - especially as it came just two months after the liquidation of a smaller bank.  After initial preparations, the formal process will commence with an invitation for expressions of interest from potential strategic investors, and the bank’s shareholders if they so wish, in taking an interest in the bank,  the central bank said in a statement.  Mindful of the concerns by depositors and the need for the process to be fully credible to potential strategic investors in order to maximise the value for depositors, the entire process is anticipated to be about 48 weeks.  The central bank had initially hoped to get Imperial Bank out of receivership by March 2016, but this was delayed after the regulator said it needed more time for investigations to determine Imperial's fate. In also announcing the granting of the new licence, the bank said:  Mayfair Bank Limited will principally target the corporate market segment.  It said Mayfair would use an initial network of two branches in Nairobi and one in Mombasa. In April, the central bank issued a licence to DIB Bank Kenya Ltd, which is owned by United Arab Emirates-based Dubai Islamic Bank. In March, the central bank said both banks had received  approval in principle  before the 2015 suspension of licensing.

North Korea's foreign ministry spokesman said Warmbier was  a victim of the policy of strategic patience  of former U.S. President Barack Obama whose government never requested his release, according to comments carried by the official KCNA agency.  The fact that Warmbier died suddenly in less than a week just after his return to the U.S. ... is a mystery to us as well,  KCNA quoted the spokesman as saying. Warmbier, 22, was arrested while visiting the reclusive country as a tourist. He was sentenced to 15 years of hard labor for trying to steal an item bearing a propaganda slogan from his hotel, North Korean state media said. He was sent home last week suffering from brain damage and in what U.S. doctors called a state of unresponsive wakefulness. He died on Monday.  Katina Adams, a spokeswoman for the U.S. State Department’s East Asia Bureau, said Washington had repeatedly requested the release of Warmbier under the Obama administration. A former senior State Department official said the United States had made repeated requests for Warmbier's release on humanitarian grounds under Obama, including via the North Korean mission at the United Nations, via the Swedish mission in Pyongyang, at unofficial talks with North Korean officials involving former U.S. officials, and via third parties. Warmbier's death fanned a conflict between the North and the United States that was already aggravated by North Korea's defiant missile launches and two nuclear tests since early last year as part of its effort to build a nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) capable of hitting the U.S. mainland. A U.S. official said on Thursday that North Korea had conducted another test of a rocket engine believed to be linked to Pyongyang's ICBM program.  Clearly a Criminal   Fred and Cindy Warmbier follow their son's, Otto Wambier, casket to the hearse after his funeral at Wyoming High School in Wyoming, Ohio, U.S. June 22, 2017.John Sommers IIU.S. President Donald Trump blamed  the brutality of the North Korean regime  for Warmbier's death. South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who had advocated talks with the North, said Pyongyang had a  heavy responsibility  in the events leading up to the University of Virginia student's death. The North's unnamed ministry spokesman said that such accusations were part of a smear campaign to slander the country that had given  medical treatments and care with all sincerity  to a person who was  clearly a criminal . U.S. doctors who traveled to the North last week to bring Warmbier home recognized that the North had provided him with medical treatment, the spokesman said.  To make it clear, we are the biggest victim of this incident.  FILE PHOTO: A person believed to be Otto Warmbier is transferred from a medical transport airplane to an awaiting ambulance at Lunken Airport in Cincinnati, Ohio, U.S., June 13, 2017.Bryan Woolston/File PhotoNorth Korea accepted repeated requests from the present U.S. administration, the spokesman said, and repatriated the student on humanitarian grounds  in consideration of his bad health.  The exact cause of Warmbier's death remains unclear. Officials at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center, where he was treated after his return, declined to provide details. His family asked the local coroner not to perform an autopsy. Thousands of friends and relatives gathered at Wyoming High School in suburban Cincinnati on Thursday for a memorial service for Warmbier, who graduated from the school as salutatorian in 2013. After returning from a five-day trip to North Korea on June 17, former National Basketball Association star Dennis Rodman suggested on Friday that his visit may have had something to do with Pyongyang's decision to send the student home. Rodman, who has faced ridicule and criticism for visiting North Korea in the past, has said he was trying to bring sports to the increasingly isolated country.  I was just so happy to see the kid released,  Rodman told ABC News in an interview.  Some good things came of this trip.    The United States has demanded North Korea release three other U.S. citizens it holds in detention: missionary Kim Dong Chul and academics Tony Kim and Kim Hak Song.

India has a tradition of honoring older people, and of multi-generational families living together. But with urbanization, nuclear families and rising longevity, more elderly people are living by themselves or in care homes. Nearly half the elderly people surveyed by non-profit HelpAge India said they had experienced abuse, both at home and in public, with more women saying they had suffered some form of mistreatment. Growing awareness of elderly abuse has led to a host of new apps and technologies for the elderly or people who witness the abuse to call for help.  It is unfortunate that we need such a solution, but that is the reality today,  said Prasad Bhide, founder of Aaji (meaning  grandmother ) Care, a mobile and web-based service that has launched a remote surveillance system. Aaji Care offers a physical panic button, which calls five phone numbers, including the company itself in an emergency. Bhide said he is also working on a smart device the elderly can use easily and discreetly to summon help when needed. India has more than 104 million people aged 60 and older, according to official data. The elderly are forecast to make up a fifth of the country's total population by 2050. An analysis of data from 28 countries, published this year by the Lancet Global Health, revealed nearly one in six people aged 60 and older had been psychologically abused, financially exploited, neglected, physically hurt or sexually abused. Abuse against older people is forecast to rise as their population more than doubles to 2 billion by 2050, according to the World Health Organization.  Despite the frequency and the serious health consequences, elder abuse remains one of the least investigated types of violence in national surveys, and one of the least addressed in national plans to prevent violence,  Alana Officer, an adviser at the WHO, said in a statement last week. Responding to pressure from campaigners, the Indian government has asked state officials to take steps to ensure the safety of the elderly. Police in Mumbai keep a record of elderly people living by themselves, and recently launched ElderLine, a helpline that connects older people with volunteer doctors, hospitals, counselors, social workers and police. Police contacted by the GPS-based tracking and dispatch system send appropriate assistance to the caller's location. A growing number of mobile app services catering to the elderly - such as in-home nursing and physiotherapy - are also adding features to help people report abuse. HelpAge India launched an SOS mobile app after its surveys showed a rise in elderly abuse. The absence of welfare safety nets for the elderly makes them dependent on their families and caregiver, and therefore more vulnerable to abuse, said Manjira Khurana, head of advocacy and communications at the non-profit. Of the respondents who said they faced abuse, more than 40 percent did not report it. HelpAge's app rings its helpline and is a  one-click, easy access emergency service , Khurana said.  It is a way for the elderly to report abuse easily, or for others to do so,  she said, noting a surge in calls to the helpline after the app was launched.

But at present politics seemed to dwarf policy, she said in a question and answer session at the London Business School.

Forbes's three-year term on the BoE's Monetary Policy Committee ends this month, and since March she has voted to raise British interest rates from their record-low 0.25 percent. In her final speech as an MPC member, she expanded on a research paper she published last week which argued that sterling weakness had a longer-term effect on inflation than the BoE typically assumed.  'Lift-off' of UK interest rates should not be delayed any longer,  she said in a speech to be given at the London Business School.  Sterling's depreciation has fundamentally shifted underlying inflation dynamics in a way that makes it more pressing to begin this voyage soon.  Forbes's remarks come after a turbulent seven days which have seen a big split emerge on the MPC at a time when inflation is picking up but growth prospects are unclear as the country prepares to leave the European Union. Two other policymakers unexpectedly joined Forbes last week in voting for higher rates, and the BoE's chief economist has said he is likely to do so later this year once the  dust cloud  around Britain's political outlook has cleared. Related CoveragePolitics, not rate outlook, is main driver for sterling - BoE's ForbesOne major bank, Nomura, said earlier on Thursday that it expected the BoE to raise rates at its next meeting in August - far earlier than the 2019 date given by most economists in a Reuters poll at the start of the month. But BoE Governor Mark Carney has poured cold water on the chances of a rate hike, highlighting  anaemic  wage growth which is likely to drag down on inflation once the effect of currency weakness fades. Britain's economy slowed in the first quarter of this year after an unexpectedly robust performance in 2016, though the BoE expects reasonable growth overall this year and next.  The UK economy appears to be solid enough on key economic criteria, and even 'overstimulated' by others, such that a moderate reduction in the substantial amount of monetary stimulus ... makes sense,  Forbes said. Weak wage growth - a factor cited by both Carney and policymaker Andrew Haldane - was not a good enough reason to hold off from raising rates, given Britain's low productivity and other price pressures.  A key lesson from monetary history is that a tightening cycle should start before wages accelerate to reach their level consistent with sustainable 2 percent inflation,  Forbes added. Reluctancy Forbes said both the BoE and the U.S. Federal Reserve appeared more reluctant to raise interest rates than in the past.  Possible reasons for this included greater accountability and public scrutiny than in earlier decades, which could make policymakers unwilling to take measures that were unpopular in the short-run. Forbes said she was not aware of BoE policymakers coming under pressure from government ministers to keep rates low. Another factor for the BoE could be its new responsibilities for financial stability, which gave senior BoE staff on the MPC less time to look in-depth at emerging inflation threats and challenge any internal consensus.  These institutional changes may provide substantial benefits for the central bank as a whole and overall economy, but these changes may also have played a role in making it more difficult to increase interest rates,  Forbes said.

Oil prices edged up on Friday, but remained on course for their worst first-half decline in almost two decades as production cuts have failed to sufficiently reduce oversupply.     Oil has plunged about 20 percent this year, despite the OPEC's efforts to cut production, which investors believe has failed to rein in the global glut.

German sovereign debt available for purchase by the ECB will be exhausted, at the latest, by the middle of next year, so a meaningful extension would require a redesign of the programme, a contentious issue since growth and inflation are both slowly moving in the right direction, sources with direct knowledge of the discussion said. The 2.3 trillion euro bond buying programme, designed to revive inflation, is set to run until the end this year but even if policymakers agree this fall to wind it down, an orderly reduction known as tapering would carry it well into next year. The problem is that the ECB's self-imposed rules mean it can only buy up to one-third of each country's debt and given Germany's relatively low debt level, it is only months away from reaching this limit.  I just don't see where we could find enough German bonds to keep this programme running beyond mid-2018, at best,  a source, who asked not to be named said.  If you want to extend, you have to reconsider the parameters and that's a difficult sell when everything is going in the right direction.   This will be a major factor in our decision on the future of the programme,  the source added. While the ECB has argued that the programme has built-in flexibility, the comments suggest that such room for manoeuvre is now clearly limited and will constrain the Governing Council. The ECB has not put a deadline on extending or winding down the scheme but a decision is likely either on either Sept 7 or Oct 26, giving markets several months to prepare. The ECB declined to comment. According to bank analyst estimates, the ECB could run up against the limits for sourcing bonds in Germany anytime between the end of this year and mid-2018. Jefferies for instance calculates that the ECB's asset-purchases scheme has another seven months to run in Germany compared with 16 months in France and 25 in Italy. The ECB could substitute German debt for bonds of supranational institutions or municipalities, but these markets lack the type of liquidity for the necessary volumes, the sources said. Already running out of longer-dated German bonds, the ECB is now buying shorter and shorter papers, booking losses as yields are deep in negative territory. Indeed, German bonds bought in May had a maturity of just four years -- the shortest since the scheme was launched in March 2015. Justified? The key contention is whether the slow rise of inflation would justify a major redesign, which could open legal debates and generate fierce opposition from more conservative countries, including Germany, the bloc's biggest economy and home to the ECB. Having flirted with deflation two years ago, consumer prices are rising again but will not hit the ECB's target of just under 2 percent for years to come. Tapering in such an environment could be seen as giving up on the target, some critics argue.  The reasons why we launched this programme are no longer there,  a Governing Council member said.  We fought off the threat of deflation and the risk of contagion between member states after the debt crisis.  Indeed, ECB board member Benoit Coeure recently argued that inflation is less dependent on the ECB's monetary policy measures, which suggests that inflation is becoming self sustaining, a key criteria for the removal of ECB stimulus. Another problem is that a major redesign would meet fierce opposition from Germany and its allies, a potentially costly battle.  Why not hold off on that battle until you have an emergency or urgent situation?  a third source said.  With inflation pointing in the right direction and growth moving higher, this is not a necessary fight.  The ECB has already looked at lifting its self-imposed limits but concluded that altering many of them, like the 33 percent limit on each country's debt, could open the door to legal challenges.  I suspect and fear that the technical constraints have become a policy constraint as well,  said Pictet Wealth Management senior economist Frederik Ducrozet.  I think it will transpire in their decision. It is clear,  said Ducrozet, who estimates that the ECB already bought less German paper in April and May than the country's shareholding in the bank would warrant.

Iranian state media said millions of people turned out for the rallies to mark Al-Quds Day that was declared by Iran's 1979 Islamic revolution founder Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and which is held on the last Friday of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan. Opposition to Israel is a touchstone of belief for Shi'ite-led Iran, which backs Palestinian and Lebanese Islamic militant groups opposed to peace with the Jewish state, which Tehran refuses to recognize. Israel, the United States and its chief Sunni Arab ally Saudi Arabia accuse Iran of fomenting tension in the Middle East and of sponsoring terrorism. This is denied by Tehran. Tensions have risen sharply in the Gulf between Qatar and four Arab states, including Saudi Arabia, in part over Doha's links with Iran.  This year's rally ... shows people want our region to be cleaned up from terrorists, backed by the Zionist regime (Israel),  President Hassan Rouhani told state TV.

In Tehran's Vali-ye Asr street, three mid-range surface-to-surface ballistic missiles were displayed, including the Zolfaghar missile that Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards used on Sunday to target bases of the IS in eastern Syria. Top Guards' commanders have repeatedly said that Israel is within range of Iran's missiles. Sunni Muslim states in the Gulf and Israel say Tehran's ballistic missile program is a threat to regional security and has led to the United States imposing new sanctions.

The blue chip FTSE 100 index was down 0.2 percent at 7,423.94 points at 0939 GMT, while mid caps were up 0.2 percent. UK shares were hit hard in the immediate aftermath of last June's Brexit vote, but recovered speedily as a fall in sterling boosted firms that earn revenue in foreign currencies. While the FTSE ended 2016 up more than 14 percent, fresh political concerns stemming from a hung parliament in the general election and uncertainty around Brexit negotiations have put the brakes on UK shares this year. Despite hitting a series of record highs along the way, British blue chips are up just 4 percent year to date with the FTSE the weakest major European market in terms of performance - in contrast the pan-European STOXX 600 has gained 7.4 percent.  The market tries to run higher looking at the benefits from the weaker pound, but then is struck back by the reality of the fact that this is an inherently unsustainable situation,  Ken Odeluga, market analyst at City Index, said. Though sectors such as housebuilders, which were hit hard, have largely bounced back, investors remain concerned around firms exposed to the domestic UK economy, such as retailers.  We expect subpar growth as Brexit bites. We see greater political instability, including a risk of early elections and a new government, but also a softer Brexit and easier policy,  Morgan Stanley's economy and strategy team said in a note. The picture is lacklustre in dollar terms especially, with both the FTSE 100 and mid caps roughly flat since the Brexit vote. A depressed sterling has increased concerns around a rise in inflation, which has hit shares in British retail stocks which could come under pressure as consumers' pockets are squeezed. Firms in internationally-exposed sectors such as miners, tobacco companies and consumer goods have been clear winners, though renewed weakness in the price of oil has dogged the FTSE 100's energy constituents. On Friday, dollar earners were the biggest fallers, with health stocks AstraZeneca and Shire, as well as Smurfit Kappa and Diageo all down between 1.2 and 1.7 percent. Oil heavyweight BP dropped 0.7 percent and Royal Dutch Shell fell 0.5 percent as the price of oil remained at depressed levels.

Colleagues It has been a year since Britain voted narrowly to remain in the European Union. As you know, this is a decision we supported, given our sizeable activities and investments in the United Kingdom. Even so, the financial and political uncertainty unleashed by the referendum has lasted longer than we expected. Changes lie ahead, but we are confident that we will be able to keep generating attractive and sustainable returns for our shareholders and employees. The boost to consumer and investor confidence from the referendum result proved fleeting. While our trading businesses benefited from the volatility of the pound and renewed inflows to UK assets in the second half of 2016, the government’s decision to push through further austerity measures and tax rises has made for a challenging environment. The Bank of England’s move to raise interest rates three times in a short period caught many unaware. Strategic actions to realise synergies from our UK workforce - while unfortunate for the individuals concerned – leave us well positioned for the cycle. Like many, we watched with concern the protests organised by the anti-EU “48 Percent” movement during its “month of rage” campaign. It is disappointing that campaigners have been unwilling to accept the democratic result and move on. Unlawful vandalism that targeted financial institutions is particularly unfortunate. This bank also voiced strong concerns about Home Secretary Theresa May’s proposal that businesses publish numbers of foreign workers. While that initiative was promptly rescinded, we have noted an increased reluctance among international talent to relocate to the United Kingdom. The good news is that the euro zone’s prospects keep getting better. French President Emmanuel Macron’s new package of incentives for financial companies has persuaded us to begin enhancing our presence there, with select headcount moves in origination and advisory. We will also be closely following the European Central Bank’s renewed attempt to relocate clearing of euro-denominated derivatives to the single currency area. We do not anticipate this will impact the seamless service we offer clients. Our Paris-based subsidiary gives us flexibility. Overall, our message is that it is business as usual. Following the leadership changes in Britain’s ruling Conservative Party, we look forward to working closely with Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his team. We are excited to hear about his proposals for a 350 million pound-a-week innovation fund for financial institutions.

The privatisation was able to get underway thanks to AIB's improving credit fundamentals, helped by falling unemployment, rising property prices and strong economic growth. Fitch projects real GDP growth for Ireland of 3.2% in 2017 and 2.7% in 2018. The Irish state today completed the sale of 25% of the 99.9% stake it has held in AIB since the bank was taken into public ownership in 2010. The sale raised EUR3 billion, indicating that the government may ultimately recoup most of the EUR20.8 billion it invested in AIB. It has already received EUR6.8 billion from AIB in repaid capital, fees, dividends, coupon payments, and levies. The shift in ownership does not change AIB's credit fundamentals or ratings, but the government's decision to start the sale process was due to the bank's improving financial profile, which this year enabled it to pay its first dividend since 2008. AIB's fully loaded common equity Tier 1 ratio was 16.0% at end-March 2017, up from 11.8% at end-2014 and comfortably above its medium-term target of 13%. The increase was driven by the partial conversion of AIB's government-held preference shares into common equity in 2015, deleveraging and solid internal capital generation. AIB's asset quality, its main rating weakness, is also improving, with the bank managing down its stock of impaired loans, helped by property price growth, investor demand and a low inflow of new impaired loans. Impaired loans fell to EUR8.6 billion at end-March 2017 from EUR28.9 billion at end-2013. AIB still has high proportions of forborne loans, low-yielding loans, including tracker mortgages, and defaulted but not impaired loans. However, we expect asset quality to continue improving in 2017, underpinned by a supportive operating environment, strong demand for Irish commercial property and the bank's proactive approach to reducing legacy assets. AIB's 'BB+'/Positive Issuer Default Rating could be upgraded if the bank's asset quality improves further, but would come under pressure if the economic effect of the UK's decision to leave the EU is particularly severe for Ireland or the UK, which could slow improvements in asset quality and capitalisation. The UK represents about 10% of AIB's lending.

China claims most of the energy-rich sea through which about $5 trillion in ship-borne trade passes every year, much of it to and from Japanese ports. Neighbors Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam also have claims. Japan worries that China is cementing its control in the South China Sea with manmade island bases, arms sales and development aid.  We are not just here to show our presence, but from the outside that is what it looks like,  Rear Admiral Yoshihiro Goga, the commander of the mission, said aboard the Izumo-class helicopter carrier. Military officers from the ten-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) boarded the 248-metre carrier in Singapore on Monday. It returned on Friday after demonstrating naval skills and kit Tokyo hopes will help it bolster alliances in the region. The Izumo turned back to Singapore before crossing a boundary known as the nine-dash-line into what China claims are its waters.  Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) SH-60 Seahawk helicopters are seen on JMSDF's helicopter carrier Izumo as they take part in a military exercise in South China Sea, near Singapore, June 21, 2017. Picture taken June 21, 2017.Nobuhiro KuboThe high-profile cruise was part of a hitherto unseen coordinated push by Japan's Self Defense Forces and defense bureaucrats to bolster ties with countries ringing the contested waters. It also marked a concerted push into military diplomacy by hawkish Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.  Japan last week held a military technology seminar near Tokyo for representatives from Thailand, Vietnam, the Philippines, Indonesia and Singapore and this week invited ASEAN officers to a disaster relief drill in Tokyo.  Slideshow (3 Images)Abe's government believes Japan may be better placed to prise Southeast Asian nations away from Chinese influence than its U.S. allies with a gentler approach that emphasizes a common Asian heritage, two sources with knowledge of the diplomatic strategy told Reuters earlier.  While the U.S. has confronted China directly by sending warships close to China's island bases in the South China Sea, Japan so far has shied away from similar provocations. As the Izumo neared the nine-dash line, the crew were on lookout for Chinese aircraft or ships sent to shadow the flag ship. Apart from brief radar contact with an unidentified aircraft  announced by the ship's public address system the carrier, however, sailed on unmolested.

Foreign ownership of Malaysian insurers was set in 2009 at 70 percent - or more if the buyer could help consolidate and rationalise the industry. But some foreign insurers operating in the country could still be wholly owned by their overseas parent. Bank Negara Malaysia last week sent letters to such wholly owned insurers requesting their foreign parents to reduce their stakes in line with regulation for domestically incorporated insurers, two people said. Recipients included the Malaysian units of Japan's Tokio Marine Holdings Inc and Hong Kong's AIA Group Ltd, one of the people said. The deadline to comply is June 2018, said one of the people, without elaborating on the consequences of non-compliance. The people declined to be identified as they were not authorised to speak publicly on the matter. Bank Negara Malaysia and the local units of AIA and Tokio Marine did not respond to requests for comment. The expected stake sales are a concern considering the size and timing, one of the people said. Malaysia has only a small number of large local funds and so insurers may have to compete for the same pool of institutional investors, the person said.  These companies are very large,  the person said.  How many Malaysian shareholders are there that will have the appetite and wallet to pick up this sort of stake, and invest this sort of money in that time frame?  Moreover, regulation restricts firms to buying into no more than one insurer.  Most of this 100 percent shareholding is a result of legacy ownership, rather than the foreign shareholders getting special leeway from the central bank,  said Brian Chia, Wong & Partners head of corporate, commercial and securities practice group. RAM Rating Services Bhd said there were 11 Malaysia-incorporated insurers wholly owned by foreign firms. It said it was too early to deduce whether enforcing the foreign ownership cap would enhance or impede the industry.  Local ownership is good in that wealth creation from premiums is retained within the country,  the credit-rating firm said.  But foreign players can bring innovation and expertise to the local industry.

Our effort of continuing to provide increased earth observation, navigation as well as communication will continue,  said the agency's chief, A.S. Kiran Kumar. Friday's lift-off comes 18 days after India put a three-tonne satellite, its heaviest, into the orbit matching the technical know-how of the United states, Russia, China, Japan and the European Space Agency.   That launch was meant to signal the ISRO's ability to launch heavier communications satellite which are at the higher end of the launch business and more lucrative.

The Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) ordered the privately owned bank to be put into receivership in October 2015 after the board of the mid-sized lender alerted it to suspected malpractices. The Imperial Bank receivership rattled confidence in a financial sector where more than 40 foreign and local banks operate - especially as it came just two months after the liquidation of a smaller bank.  After initial preparations, the formal process will commence with an invitation for Expressions of Interest from potential strategic investors, and the bank’s shareholders if they so wish, in taking an interest in the bank,  the central bank said in a statement.  Mindful of the concerns by depositors and the need for the process to be fully credible to potential strategic investors in order to maximise the value for depositors, the entire process is anticipated to be about 48 weeks.  The central bank had initially hoped to get Imperial Bank out of receivership by March 2016, but this was delayed after the regulator said it needed more time for investigations to determine Imperial's fate.

The Philippines accepted the offer of two AP-3C Orion aircraft for reconnaissance to pinpoint locations of Maute group fighters holed up for a fifth week in Marawi, a town the rebels have declared as their own Islamic territory.  The regional threat from terrorism, in particular from Daesh and foreign fighters, is a direct threat to Australia and our interests,  Australian Defense Minister Marise Payne said in a statement, referring to Islamic State by an Arabic acronym. Australia's help comes as fears grow that the Maute and its affiliates have much stronger designs on parts of the southern Philippines than previously imagined, evidenced by their preparations and combat capability during the weeks of fighting. The threat is heightened by losses suffered by Islamic State in Syria and Iraq, and intelligence reports that it is building alliances and seeking new pastures from which to project its agenda. Gilbert Gapay, an Philippine military spokesman, said the  surveillance planes would help tackle extremism across Mindanao, an island of 22 million people, where separatists, pirates and kidnap gangs have thrived for decades.  He said the battle for Marawi was not a failure because the military had learned a lot and was stopping Islamic State from taking root.  This gives us a picture of the expanse of their network,  Gapay told reporters.  They won't thrive anymore in our country.  But security experts say the battle has exposed intelligence and operational failures by the Philippines and its limited cooperation with neighboring Malaysia and Indonesia to stop extremism from spreading. The three countries on Thursday agreed on joint measures to pool information and try to stem recruitment, movement and financing of fighters. The Philippines says it knows of 40 foreign operatives in the country. An OV-10 aircraft release a rocket during an airstrike against the so-called Maute group, who have taken over large parts of Marawi city.Romeo Ranoco'Last Stand' Australia's support follows that of Philippine defense treaty ally the United States, which has provided technical help through military surveillance and communications experts stationed in Zamboanga city on Mindanao.  The Philippines has welcomed foreign support amid operations that have had mixed results, with 67 security forces killed as rebels withstand a fifth week of ground assaults and air strikes, one of which saw 10 government troops killed on June 1 when a bomb missed its target. Philippine troops, more adept at fighting in jungles and mountains, have found unfamiliar territory in the urban warfare that has devastated much of Marawi and displaced nearly 250,000 people. Slideshow (2 Images)Some 300 civilians were believed to be either trapped or being used as human shields, according to the army. Civilians involved in relief efforts believe the number could be higher. Planes dropped more bombs early on Friday and the army tried to flush out the estimated 90-100 rebels with artillery and heavy gunfire. Efforts were being slowed by roadside bombs, snipers and booby-trapped vehicles and gas tanks.  This is already their last stand and they are getting desperate,  Jo-Ar Herrera, a military spokesman, told reporters.  Our mission is to neutralize them so that they will no longer threaten other parts of the Philippines.  Residents who fled militant-held areas say the black-clad Maute militia are in the fight for the long haul and are trying to cement their presence as an arm of Islamic State.   They patrol the streets on foot and on vehicles, which they spray with black paint and have mounted big guns,  said Norodin Garangan, 44, who escaped on Wednesday.  I know there are still people in our area but they're afraid to go out.

The world's second-largest economy bought goods worth $123.8 million in May from North Korea, down 31 percent from a year ago and third lowest on records going back to June 2014, according to data from China's General Administration of Customs. The total was up from $99.3 million in April, the lowest on record. The second weakest total was registered in March. The data indicates that China's halt of North Korean coal imports on Feb. 26 has crimped Pyongyang's ability to raise hard currency through exports. China's iron ore imports from North Korea in May, at 233,508 tonnes and worth $13.4 million accounted for 11 percent of the total for the month. Chinese exports to North Korea in May rose to $319.8 million, up 11 percent from April and a third higher than in the same month last year. The data came a day after the United States pressed China again to exert more economic and diplomatic pressure on North Korea to help rein in its nuclear and missile programs during a round of high-level talks in Washington. On Friday, a U.S. official told Reuters that North Korea had carried out another test of a rocket engine believed to be part of its programme to develop an intercontinental ballistic missile.

When spot Asian iron ore prices jumped 81 percent in 2016, the surprise rally was chalked up to stronger Chinese imports and signs that a market that had been oversupplied for several years was back in balance.  China, which buys about two-thirds of seaborne iron ore, certainly did boost imports in 2016, buying more than 1 billion tonnes in a year for the first time, with overseas purchases of the steel-making ingredient rising 7.5 percent.  There has been little let up in the pace this year, with imports from January to May jumping 7.9 percent from the same period in 2016 to 444.6 million tonnes, putting them on track for an annual increase of about 65 million tonnes.  Imports look set to remain robust in June as well, with ship and port data compiled by Thomson Reuters Supply Chain and Commodity Forecasts pointing to arrivals of 93 million tonnes.  This number was filtered to show only vessels that have already discharged cargoes or are underway, and may be revised higher as late cargoes get added.  Overall, the picture shows that China's appetite for imported iron ore remains strong, meaning the price decline so far this year isn't driven by weakening demand.  The spot price ended at $56.82 a tonne on Wednesday, down 28 percent from the start of the year and 40 percent from a peak of $94.86 on Feb. 21.  Chinese domestic iron ore futures have fared some better, with Dalian Commodity Exchange contracts slipping 8.1 percent so far this year to Wednesday's close of 426 yuan ($62.37) a tonne, and down 33 percent from their Feb. 21 peak. Steel, Iron Ore Tread Different Paths In contrast, benchmark Chinese steel futures, the Shanghai rebar contract, have gained 15.1 percent since the end of last year to Wednesday's close of 3,060 yuan a tonne.  This divergence between Chinese steel and iron ore prices is a marked change from last year, when they rallied in tandem, with rebar gaining 96 percent to spot iron ore's 81 percent.  China's steel market appears relatively robust currently, with output in May rising 1.8 percent from a year earlier to 72.26 million tonnes, just below April's monthly record of 72.78 million tonnes.  In the first five months of 2017, production was 346.8 million tonnes, up 4.4 percent from the same period last year, according to official figures.  Higher steel output is a response to solid margins for steelmakers, which are being supported by ongoing capacity cuts and a still reasonable outlook for construction and manufacturing.  It's mainly low-quality furnaces that are being targeted for closure by Chinese authorities as part of plans to shut at least 50 million tonnes of capacity this year, which follows on from 65 million tonnes idled last year. Assuming the demand outlook for steel doesn't deteriorate too much in the second half of the year, the capacity closures should help keep steel mills profitable and support prices. But for iron ore the arrival of additional tonnes on the seaborne market from expansion projects by Brazil's Vale and the new Roy Hill mine in Western Australia will keep the market's focus on supply. Citi analysts said in a report received this week that the seaborne market could be oversupplied by 100 million tonnes in 2017, leading them to cut their average price forecast for this year to $61 a tonne from $70 previously. Once again, it appears that the iron ore market is going to play the game of who can survive lower prices the longest. While low-cost major miners such as Vale and Anglo-Australian pair Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton are best-placed, smaller Australian players and producers in minor exporters like Ukraine and Canada will struggle to hold on.

Calendar spreads for Brent futures throughout the rest of 2017 and 2018 have weakened significantly since OPEC agreed to roll over its production allocations at the end of May. Calendar spreads (price differences between futures contracts for delivery in different months) are closely linked to the expected level of oil inventories. Physical traders and refiners use spreads to hedge oil stored at tank farms and refineries as well as onboard ships in transit or acting as floating storage. But spreads can also be used by traders and specialist hedge funds to speculate on the level of global oil stocks in future. High and/or rising inventories are normally associated with a contango structure, where the price for oil delivered in future is higher than for immediate delivery. Low and/or declining global inventories are normally associated with a backwardation, where the price for future deliveries is below the spot price. The theoretical relationship between stocks and spreads was formulated by economist Holbrook Working in the 1930s in relation to U.S. grain futures. But the same relationship has been visible in oil, where the shift in Brent spreads between contango and backwardation has mirrored the build up and draw down in inventories since the 1990s. Brent spreads have therefore become one of the favorite ways for speculative traders to express a view on the outlook for oil production, consumption and stocks. Spreads for the remaining months of 2017 have moved into an increasingly wide contango since May 25 (tmsnrt.rs/2rZ7llh). Spreads for 2018 have seen an even more startling move from a small backwardation into a broad contango over the same period (tmsnrt.rs/2stXAzc). On May 24, the day before OPEC last meeting, Brent futures for December 2017 were trading at a premium of 99 cents per barrel over contracts for December 2018. By June 21, December 2017 futures were trading at a discount of $2.69, a shift in the spread of more than $3.50 per barrel in less than a month (tmsnrt.rs/2stKbak). Plentiful Stocks Calendar spreads are not an infallible guide to future stock levels especially beyond the next few months. Spread traders are often proved wrong.  But the emergence of a large contango implies many hedgers and speculators now expect stocks to remain higher than before. OPEC, led by Saudi Arabia, and its non-OPEC allies, led by Russia, have pledged to do  whatever it takes  to bring OECD inventories down to the five-year average. But many analysts and traders are skeptical the current level of cuts will be enough to bring stocks down to the target this year or prevent them rising again next year. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) forecasts global inventories will fall by an average of 0.2 million barrels per day in 2017 before increasing by an average of 0.1 million bpd in 2018. EIA forecasts OECD commercial stocks will still stand at 2,989 million barrels at the end of 2017, almost 230 million barrels higher than the year-end average for 2012-2016. The agency also predicts OECD stocks will rise to 3,020 million barrels at the end of 2018, which would be almost 260 million barrels over the 2012-2016 average. The forecasts assume OPEC's output agreement is extended beyond March 2018 but compliance deteriorates ( Short-Term Energy Outlook , EIA, June 2017). If these forecasts prove correct, OPEC will only have made limited progress towards its goal of rebalancing the market even by the end of 2018. Storage and Shale The recent drop in oil prices has been concentrated in near-term futures contracts. Brent for delivery in October 2017 has fallen by $9.50 since May 23, while Brent for delivery in December 2018 is down by only $5.50 per barrel. Sharp falls in the cost of crude for delivery in the near future provide an enhanced incentive to buy and store excess oil, helping the market carry a higher level of inventories than anticipated before. Near-term price declines also send a strong, urgent signal to U.S. shale producers to curb their drilling to avert an even bigger build up of inventories in future.

Turkey, the second-largest buyer of Russian wheat after Egypt and the biggest buyer of its sunflower oil, had been in an agriculture trade dispute with Russia since mid-March when it imposed what Moscow regarded as prohibitively high import tariffs. The dispute, which had brought Russia's grain supplies to Turkey to a virtual standstill, was resolved at the meeting of the presidents of the two countries - Tayyip Erdogan and Vladimir Putin - in early May when Moscow agreed to scrap some of its restrictions on Ankara.  There are no problems (with supplies to Turkey),  Sergey Balan, the head of Russia's National Association of Exporters of Agricultural Products, told Reuters.  Everything resumed its natural course.  According to Balan, traders have already fulfilled supplies of wheat, which were delayed by the trade limits. Russia boosted wheat exports to Turkey to 105,300 tonnes in May from 58,400 tonnes in April, SovEcon agriculture consultancy said in a note, citing customs data. Since the start of this 2016/17 marketing year on July 1, Turkey bought 2.4 million tonnes of Russian wheat, or 9 percent of Russia's total wheat exports. The normalization of the trade relations between Moscow and Ankara was also bolstered in late May when Putin lifted restrictions on hiring Turkish workers and on Turkish firms operating in Russia.  It looks like everything has become normal,  a Turkish wheat buyer, based in Russia, said. There is no price premium for the supplies to Turkey in the new contracts, he added. Dmitry Rylko, the head of IKAR agriculture consultancy, also confirmed this.  Sunflower oil supplies to Turkey have also returned to normal and there are no signs of any problems, Mikhail Maltsev, the head of Russia's Oil and Fats Union, told Reuters. Russia exported 13,200 tonnes of sunflower oil to Turkey in May, down from 32,500 tonnes in April and 73,700 tonnes in March, according to SovEcon. Supplies in March were boosted by traders' attempts to fulfil previously signed contracts before the launch of the high import tariffs in mid-March.  Exports can be down in May but they were on a record level before that,  Maltsev said. Russia exported 1.2 million tonnes of sunflower oil in October-May, of which 406,800 tonnes were sent to Turkey. Russia is keeping its a ban on Turkish tomato imports - an issue Ankara is eager to resolve - but it does not affect Russian grain exports. Moscow argues that allowing tomato imports from Turkey would harm domestic farmers.

Depp, 54, was speaking to a crowd on Thursday evening as he introduced a screening of his 2004 film  The Libertine  at the music and performing arts festival. Discussion turned to the topic of U.S. President Trump.  It is just a question, I'm not insinuating anything... When was the last time an actor assassinated a president?  Depp asked the audience, in a possible reference to actor John Wilkes Booth, who assassinated President Abraham Lincoln in 1865.  Now I want to clarify, I'm not an actor. I lie for a living. However, it's been a while, and maybe it's time.  Depp's comments come less than a month after comedian Kathy Griffin drew strong criticism for posing in photographs holding up the likeness of a bloody, severed head resembling Trump. CNN ultimately fired Griffin from its annual New Year's Eve broadcast over the controversy. Last week, a gunman shot at Republican lawmakers who were practising for a charity baseball game. The Secret Service said in a statement to ABC that it actively monitored open source reporting, including social media networks and evaluates potential threats.  For security reasons, we cannot discuss specifically nor in general terms the means and methods of how we perform our protective responsibilities,  the Secret Service said. Depp, the face of the Pirates of the Caribbean movie franchise, seemed aware his comments might spur controversy.  This is going to be in the press,  he said before making the comments.  It will be horrible.

Alinta Energy, recently taken over by Hong Kong's Chow Tai Fook Enterprises (CTFE), and Australian firm Delta Electricity are in the running, three sources said.  Engie's sale of its coal-fired Loy Yang B unit and the shutdown of another in Australia is part of a push by the French company to move away from fossil-fuelled power globally.   There have been some expressions of interest and we are working on it. We will make an announcement later this year,  Engie Executive Vice President Didier Holleaux told Reuters on Friday. He declined to comment on the bidders.  Delta Electricity, which owns another coal-fired plant, declined to comment on the Loy Yang B plant.  Delta's managing director, Greg Everett, however, said the company sees a future for coal as a source of stable power in a market where variable wind and solar energy need back-up.  We're heavily invested in the industry, and we're looking to make further investments,  Everett said on Friday at the Australian Energy Week conference in Melbourne.  Alinta and Chow Tai Fook Enterprises did not respond to  requests for comment.   Alinta is only interested in Loy Yang B if it can get the asset cheaply as this would be an opportunistic acquisition, and not strategic,  said a market source familiar with the company.      Two other companies that might be in the running are China Resources Power Holdings Co (0836.HK) and private equity firm Blackstone, bankers said. Blackstone declined to comment, and China Resources Power and its parent company, China Resources, did not respond to requests for comment.   The three sources declined to be named as the sale process is confidential.  Engie and its partner, Japan's Mitsui & Co (8031.T), put the Loy Yang B plant up for sale at the same time that Engie shut Hazelwood, its other coal-fired plant in Australia.      Hazelwood is one of nine coal-fired power plants that have been closed in Australia over the past five years. The loss of coal- and gas-fired generation has contributed to blackouts and sharp price increases at times of heavy demand when wind and solar could not produce enough electricity.  Those higher prices are going to benefit any generators that remain in the market, Delta's Everett said.      As (coal-fired) plants get older and they do close, those plants which are left are going to become more essential and they will be seeing the price increases as a result of the closure of some of their compatriots,  Everett said.  The winning bidder for Loy Yang B may need to turn to the offshore U.S. term loan B market for financing, banking sources told Thomson Reuters publication Basis Point, as commercial banks are wary of providing loans to the coal sector.

The demands aimed at ending the worst Gulf Arab crisis in years appear designed to quash a two decade-old foreign policy in which Qatar has punched well above its weight, striding the stage as a peace broker, often in conflicts in Muslim lands. Doha's independent-minded approach, including a dovish line on Iran and support for Islamist groups, in particular the Muslim Brotherhood, has incensed some of its neighbours who see political Islamism as a threat to their dynastic rule. The list, compiled by Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Egypt and Bahrain, which cut economic, diplomatic and travel ties to Doha on June 5, also demands the closing of a Turkish military base in Qatar, the official told Reuters. Turkey's Defence Minister Fikri Isik rejected the demand, saying any call for the base to be shut would represent interference in Ankara's relations with Doha. He suggested instead that Turkey might bolster its presence.  Strengthening the Turkish base would be a positive step in terms of the Gulf's security,  he said.  Re-evaluating the base agreement with Qatar is not on our agenda.  Qatar must also announce it is severing ties with terrorist, ideological and sectarian organisations including the Muslim Brotherhood, Islamic State, al Qaeda, Hezbollah, and Jabhat Fateh al Sham, formerly al Qaeda's branch in Syria, the Arab official said, and surrender all designated terrorists on its territory. Qatar Won't Negotiate Under Boycott The four Arab countries accuse Qatar of funding terrorism, fomenting regional instability and cosying up to revolutionary theocracy Iran. Qatar has denied the accusations. Qatari officials did not reply immediately to requests for comment. But on Monday, Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani said Qatar would not negotiate with the four states unless they lifted their measures against Doha. The countries give Doha 10 days to comply, failing which the list becomes  void , the official said without elaborating, suggesting the offer to end the dispute in return for the 13 steps would no longer be on the table.  The demands are so aggressive that it makes it close to impossible to currently see a resolution of that conflict,  said Olivier Jakob, a strategist at Switzerland-based oil consultancy Petromatrix. Several Qataris who spoke to Reuters described the demands as unreasonable.  Imagine another country demanding that CNN be closed,  said 40-year-old Haseeb Mansour, who works for telecom operator Ooredoo. Abdullah al-Muhanadi, a retired public sector shopping for groceries in Doha on Friday morning, said the boycott must be lifted before negotiations to resolve the dispute could start.  There's a lot on the list that is simply not true or unreasonable, so how can we comply?  he said.  There are no IRGC (Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps) elements in Qatar and the agreement with Turkey is a long-standing diplomatic agreement so we cannot ask them to leave.  The demands, handed to Qatar by mediator Kuwait also require that Qatar stop interfering in the four countries' domestic and foreign affairs and stop a practice of giving Qatari nationality to citizens of the four countries, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Qatar must pay reparations to these countries for any damage or costs incurred over the past few years because of Qatari policies, he added. Any resulting agreement to comply with the demands will be monitored, with monthly reports in the first year, then every three months the next year, then annually for 10 years, the official said without elaborating. U.S. President Donald Trump has taken a tough stance on Qatar, accusing it of being a  high level  sponsor of terrorism, but he has also offered help to the parties in the dispute to resolve their differences. Turkey has backed Qatar during the three-week-old crisis. It sent its first ship carrying food aid to Qatar and dispatched a small contingent of soldiers and armoured vehicles there on Thursday, while President Tayyip Erdogan spoke with Saudi Arabia's leaders on calming tension in the region.

KEY RATING DRIVERS The rating and Outlook reflect adequate external credit enhancement (CE) of 10.0% of the initial principal balance as well as STFCL's origination practices, servicing experience and expertise in collection and recovery of commercial-vehicle loans in India, especially in the used-vehicle segment. The transaction is supported by a sound legal and financial structure. The CE will comprise a first-loss credit facility (FLCF) and a second-loss credit facility (SLCF). Fitch expects the FLCF to be in the form of fixed deposits with a bank rated at least 'BBB-' and 'F3' by Fitch in the name of the originator, with a lien marked in favour of the trustee. The SLCF is expected to be in the form of a fixed deposit with a bank rated at least 'BBB-' and 'F3' by Fitch, with a lien marked in favour of the trustee, but it may subsequently be replaced by an unconditional and irrevocable guarantee provided by a bank rated at least 'BBB-' and 'F3' by Fitch. The CE is deemed sufficient to cover the commingling risks of the servicer and the liquidity required for the timely payment of the PTCs. Fitch affirmed India's Long-Term Foreign- and Local-Currency Issuer Default Ratings at 'BBB-' in May 2017 and forecasts real GDP growth to accelerate to 7.4% in the financial year ending-March 2018 (FY18) and 7.5% in FY19 (FY17: 7.1%). Fitch has factored this macroeconomic outlook into its analysis and base-case default-rate assumptions. The default rate, default timing, prepayment rate, recovery rate and time to recovery, together with the portfolio's weighted-average (WA) yield, were stressed in Fitch's ABS cash flow model to assess the sufficiency of cash flow for timely payment at the current rating level. No interest-rate or foreign-currency risks exist in the transaction, since both the assets and PTCs are fixed-rate and denominated in rupees. The transaction comprises a seasoned portfolio, with loans from 21 Indian states. The collateral pool will be assigned to the trust at par; and as of the 20 June 2017 cut-off date, it had an aggregate scheduled outstanding principal balance of INR6.5 billion and consisted of 12,724 loans to 12,069 obligors. The maximum obligor concentration is 0.26%. Fitch deems the characteristics of this portfolio to be compatible with the Global Consumer ABS Rating Criteria given that 94.6% of the loans are provided to individuals. The CE provided in the transaction adequately covers the loss from obligors, accounting for more than 0.05% of the current principal outstanding. The collateral pool has a WA original loan/value ratio of 70.9%, a WA seasoning of 10.5 months and a WA yield of 14.6%. Loans in the securitised pool were mostly current as of the cut-off date. Fitch gave some credit to the WA seasoning of the underlying loans. EXPECTED RATING SENSITIVITIES Based on Fitch's sensitivity analysis, the agency may consider downgrading the transaction's rating to 'BB(EXP)sf' if the base-case default rate increases by 30% or to 'BB+(EXP)sf  if the base-case recovery rate declines by 30%. The PTC rating may be downgraded to 'BB-(EXP)sf' if both the base-case default and recovery rates worsen by 30% simultaneously. The sensitivity analysis assumes CE and other factors remain constant. The rating may be upgraded if the ratings of the credit collateral banks holding the FLCF and SLCF deposits and the bank providing the guarantee are upgraded to above 'BBB-' and the portfolio performance remains sound, with adequate CE that can withstand stress at above a 'BBB-sf' rating scenario. USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10 Form ABS Due Diligence-15E was not provided to, or reviewed by, Fitch in relation to this rating action. REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS A description of the transaction's representations, warranties and enforcement mechanisms (RW&Es;) disclosed in the offering document that relate to the underlying asset pool is available by accessing the appendix referenced under  Related Research  below. The appendix also contains a comparison of these RW&Es; to those Fitch considers typical for the asset class as detailed in the Special Report titled  Representations, Warranties and Enforcement Mechanisms in Global Structured Finance Transactions,  dated 31 May 2016. DATA ADEQUACY Fitch reviewed the results of a third-party assessment conducted on the asset portfolio information, which indicated no adverse findings material to the rating analysis. Fitch reviewed a small targeted sample of STFCL's origination files and found the information contained in the reviewed files to be adequately consistent with the originator's policies and practices and the other information provided to the agency about the asset portfolio. Overall, Fitch's assessment of the asset pool information relied upon for the agency's rating analysis according to its applicable rating methodologies indicates that it is adequately reliable. SOURCES OF INFORMATION The information below was used in the analysis: - Loan-by-loan final pool data provided by STFCL as at June 2017. - Transaction documentation provided by STFCL as at June 2017. - Over 10 years of static quarterly net default loan data by STFCL up to end-2016. - Over 10 years of dynamic quarterly net default loan data by STFCL up to end-2016.

The manner of Fitch’s factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors.

More than 5.6 million children in Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Nigeria, many of whom have been uprooted by violence and live in host communities or refugee camps, are facing the disease threat as the rains arrive, said the U.N. children's agency (UNICEF). Flooding and muddy roads are expected to limit aid access to remote areas, where hunger is growing and food is lacking, while the insecurity has made it hard to deliver supplies and ensure clean water is available ahead of the rains, aid agencies say.     The rains will further complicate what is already a dire humanitarian situation, as millions of children made vulnerable by conflict are now facing the potential spread of opportunistic diseases,  Marie Pierre Poirier of UNICEF said in a statement.  Unsafe water, inadequate sanitation and poor hygiene conditions can lead to cholera and hepatitis E,  said UNICEF's regional director.  Staving off disease is our top priority.  Cholera, which spreads through contaminated food and water, causes diarrhea and vomiting, leaving small children especially vulnerable to death from dehydration, whereas liver disease hepatitis E is particularly deadly for pregnant women. In Niger's Diffa region - which has been hit by the conflict and hosts about 250,000 uprooted Nigeriens and Nigerian refugees - an outbreak of hepatitis E has killed at least 33 pregnant women so far this year, said Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF).  To curb this type of outbreak, we know that our best asset at the moment is ... water and sanitation activities,  said Víctor Illanes of the aid group.  But when the deficiencies are so high and the space to be covered is as large as Diffa, it is difficult for these activities to have an impact in the short term,  he added. Boko Haram's campaign to create an Islamic state is in its eighth year with little sign of ending. It has claimed more than 20,000 lives and uprooted 2.7 million people across Lake Chad. More than 5 million people in northeast Nigeria need food aid, and about 1.5 million are believed to be on the brink of famine, yet the United Nations this month had to cut emergency food supplies for 400,000 people due to a lack of funding.

Britain's FTSE 100 fell 0.3 percent to 7,413.33 points, weighed down by weakness in mining and oil stocks, as well as in shares of large-cap dollar earners. Friday marked the one-year anniversary of Britons voting in a referendum to quit the EU, a shock outcome which sent sterling, British and European stocks into a tailspin. While stocks have recovered sharply from their slump in the immediate aftermath, in U.S. dollar terms, British stocks continue to lag peers in Europe and elsewhere as a cloudy outlook for sterling dented appetite among foreign investors.  Brexit itself, I don't think, has had much of an effect on the market, but what has had an effect has been the fall in sterling,  Paul Mumford, senior investment manager at Cavendish Asset Management, said.  Because of the uncertainty that might have arisen from the election result, it may be that sterling is going to stay down longer than we thought,  added Cavendish's Mumford, referring to the recent British general election which resulted in a hung parliament. The pan-European STOXX 600 index was down 0.1 percent as a bruised oil price weighed on Europe's broader energy sector, which fell 0.3 percent. Elsewhere, broker changes helped drive price action, with German lender Commerzbank rising 1.5 percent on a negative banking index after an upgrade from Citi. Citi raised its rating on Commerzbank to a  buy , saying that it expects the bank's profitability to recover. Shares in pizza delivery firm Domino's Pizza were among the biggest fallers, down 3.6 percent near a two-year low after a downgrade from Berenberg. Berenberg analysts said that Domino's faced potential issues ahead, including falling behind in terms of technology as well as food inflation putting pressure on franchisee margins. Danish pharma firm Lundbeck was the biggest STOXX faller, dropping more than 4 percent after receiving a second complete response letter from the FDA about its antidepressant Trintellix.

Russia's defense ministry said a week ago it believed it may have killed Baghdadi when one of its air strikes hit a gathering of senior Islamic State commanders on the outskirts of the Syrian city of Raqqa. But armed groups fighting in the region and U.S. officials say they have no evidence that Baghdadi was killed, and many regional officials have said they are skeptical about the information from Moscow. Committee head Viktor Ozerov was quoted as saying the defense ministry would not have released information about Baghdadi's death if it believed it could be later proved incorrect.  I think this information is close to 100 percent,  Interfax quoted Ozerov as saying.  The fact that Islamic State has still not shown him anywhere also adds to our confidence that al-Baghdadi has been killed.  Baghdadi has frequently been reported killed or wounded since he declared a caliphate from a mosque in Mosul in 2014, after leading his fighters on a sweep through northern Iraq. His death would be one of the biggest blows yet to the jihadist group, which is trying to defend its shrinking territory in Syria and Iraq against forces backed by regional and global powers.

In a statement marking Eid al-Fitr, the festival at the end of the holy month of Ramadan, Taliban leader Mullah Haibatullah Akhundzada combined defiant calls for the United States to get out of Afghanistan with more conciliatory messages.  The occupation is the main obstacle in the way of peace,  he said, in comments which echoed similar messages the movement has sent in the past. While not explicitly acknowledging the recent debate in Washington over U.S. policy in Afghanistan, the message appeared to address several of the arguments made for maintaining or even boosting support for the Western-backed government in Kabul. In particular, it rejected the concerns that Afghanistan could once again become a haven for foreign militants seeking to attack the United States and its allies as al Qaeda did when it struck the Twin Towers in 2001.  Calling for  complete independence of the country and establishment of an Islamic system , he warned against plans under consideration to increase the number of U.S. troops in Afghanistan by up to 3,000-5,000.  The more they insist on maintaining the presence of their forces here or want a surge of their forces, the more regional sensitivity against them will intensify,  he said. However, he also promised  constructive and good relations with you and the world  once  your illegitimate occupation of Afghanistan comes to an end . He dismissed widespread accusations that the Taliban benefited from aid from other countries including Pakistan and, more recently, Russia, saying it would  not allow anyone else to intervene in Afghanistan .  Likewise, we don't permit others to use the soil of Afghanistan against anyone,  he said. He urged the United States to accept the  legitimate demands of the Afghan people  and seek peace through diplomatic means but appeared to offer no concession on the Taliban's central demand that foreign forces must leave before peace talks begin.  The solution of the Afghan issue through peaceful means is part and parcel of the policy of the Islamic Emirate, should the occupation come to an end,  he said. The statement had harsh words for the government of President Ashraf Ghani, which it dismissed as a  stooge  of America and blamed for rising ethnic and factional tensions in Kabul and elsewhere. It also urged Taliban fighters to avoid civilian casualties, a call likely to be dismissed by the government and its allies following Thursday's attack on a bank in Helmand that killed at least 34 people and last month's deadly truck bomb in Kabul that killed at least 150 civilians. Although the Taliban have denied responsibility for the Kabul attack, Afghanistan's main intelligence agency said it was planned and carried out by the Taliban-affiliated Haqqani network.

Team owners confirmed her exit on Wednesday, citing  diverging views of the future of the company , while board chairman Pascal Picci denied speculation that her departure concerned the status of their drivers and a desire to favor Sweden's Ericsson.  For me and Pascal it has been very clear it is not the case,  Ericsson said on Thursday, addressing the suggestion that Kaltenborn had departed the Swiss-based team due to favoritism ahead of this weekend's Azerbaijan Grand Prix.   We have both been given equal equipment and priorities, and that's how it's always been in this team and will always be.  It's all been quite sudden, in the last 48 hours it's all been happening,  he continued.  It's quite a new thing for me as a driver as well.

Wehrlein echoed his team mate's surprise at the departure of Kaltenborn, who previously held a 33.3 percent stake in the team before it was taken over by Longbow Finance S.A. last year.  I was very surprised,  the German driver said.  I spoke with Monisha on Tuesday evening, she called me and she told me about it, and of course I was really surprised about it.   Obviously everyone is asking questions. If it's good or bad or what has changed in the team. I think the drivers are not the right person to comment too much on it.   I am just doing my job and I want to perform as good as I can, and everything about this is not part of my job.  Kaltenborn joined Sauber in 2000 to run the legal department and took over as chief executive in 2010. While the team fell on hard times in recent seasons, their financial problems eased when Swiss-based investment company Longbow took over last July.

Russian authorities are asking Western tech companies to allow them to review source code for security products such as firewalls, anti-virus applications and software containing encryption before permitting the products to be imported and sold in the country. The requests, which have increased since 2014, are ostensibly done to ensure foreign spy agencies have not hidden any  backdoors  that would allow them to burrow into Russian systems. But those inspections also provide the Russians an opportunity to find vulnerabilities in the products' source code - instructions that control the basic operations of computer equipment - current and former U.S. officials and security experts said. While a number of U.S. firms say they are playing ball to preserve their entree to Russia's huge tech market, at least one U.S. firm, Symantec, told Reuters it has stopped cooperating with the source code reviews over security concerns. That halt has not been previously reported. Symantec said one of the labs inspecting its products was not independent enough from the Russian government. U.S. officials say they have warned firms about the risks of allowing the Russians to review their products' source code, because of fears it could be used in cyber attacks. But they say they have no legal authority to stop the practice unless the technology has restricted military applications or violates U.S. sanctions. From their side, companies say they are under pressure to acquiesce to the demands from Russian regulators or risk being shut out of a lucrative market. The companies say they only allow Russia to review their source code in secure facilities that prevent code from being copied or altered. (Graphic on source code review process: tmsnrt.rs/2sZudWT) The demands are being made by Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB), which the U.S. government says took part in the cyber attacks on Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign and the 2014 hack of 500 million Yahoo email accounts. The FSB, which has denied involvement in both the election and Yahoo hacks, doubles as a regulator charged with approving the sale of sophisticated technology products in Russia. The reviews are also conducted by the Federal Service for Technical and Export Control (FSTEC), a Russian defense agency tasked with countering cyber espionage and protecting state secrets. Records published by FSTEC and reviewed by Reuters show that from 1996 to 2013, it conducted source code reviews as part of approvals for 13 technology products from Western companies. In the past three years alone it carried out 28 reviews. A Kremlin spokesman referred all questions to the FSB. The FSB did not respond to requests for comment. FSTEC said in a statement that its reviews were in line with international practice. The U.S. State Department declined to comment. Moscow's source code requests have mushroomed in scope since U.S.-Russia relations went into a tailspin following the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014, according to eight current and former U.S. officials, four company executives, three U.S. trade attorneys and Russian regulatory documents. In addition to IBM, Cisco and Germany's SAP, Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co and McAfee have also allowed Russia to conduct source code reviews of their products, according to people familiar with the companies' interactions with Moscow and Russian regulatory records. Until now, little has been known about that regulatory review process outside of the industry. The FSTEC documents and interviews with those involved in the reviews provide a rare window into the tense push-and-pull between technology companies and governments in an era of mounting alarm about hacking. Roszel Thomsen, an attorney who helps U.S. tech companies navigate Russia import laws, said the firms must balance the dangers of revealing source code to Russian security services against possible lost sales.  Some companies do refuse,  he said.  Others look at the potential market and take the risk.   We Have a Real Concern  If tech firms do decline the FSB's source code requests, then approval for their products can be indefinitely delayed or denied outright, U.S. trade attorneys and U.S. officials said. The Russian information technology market is expected to be worth $18.4 billion this year, according to market researcher International Data Corporation (IDC). Six current and former U.S. officials who have dealt with companies on the issue said they are suspicious about Russia's motives for the expanded reviews.  It’s something we have a real concern about,  said a former senior Commerce Department official who had direct knowledge of the interaction between U.S. companies and Russian officials until he left office this year.  You have to ask yourself what it is they are trying to do, and clearly they are trying to look for information they can use to their advantage to exploit, and that’s obviously a real problem.  However, none of the officials who spoke to Reuters could point to specific examples of hacks or cyber espionage that were made possible by the review process. Source code requests are not unique to Russia. In the United States, tech companies allow the government to audit source code in limited instances as part of defense contracts and other sensitive government work. China sometimes also requires source code reviews as a condition to import commercial software, U.S. trade attorneys say.  Clean Rooms  The reviews often takes place in secure facilities known as  clean rooms.  Several of the Russian companies that conduct the testing for Western tech companies on behalf of Russian regulators have current or previous links to the Russian military, according to their websites. Echelon, a Moscow-based technology testing company, is one of several independent FSB-accredited testing centers that Western companies can hire to help obtain FSB approval for their products. Echelon CEO Alexey Markov told Reuters his engineers review source code in special laboratories, controlled by the companies, where no software data can be altered or transferred. Markov said Echelon is a private and independent company but does have a business relationship with Russia’s military and law enforcement authorities. Echelon’s website touts medals it was awarded in 2013 by Russia’s Ministry of Defense for  protection of state secrets.  The company’s website also sometimes refers to Markov as the  Head of Attestation Center of the Ministry of Defense.  In an email, Markov said that title is only intended to convey Echelon’s role as a certified outside tester of military technology testing. The medals were generic and insignificant, he said. But for Symantec, the lab  didn't meet our bar  for independence, said spokeswoman Kristen Batch. “In the case of Russia, we decided the protection of our customer base through the deployment of uncompromised security products was more important than pursuing an increase in market share in Russia,” said Batch, who added that the company did not believe Russia had tried to hack into its products. In 2016, the company decided it would no longer use third parties, including Echelon, that have ties to a foreign state or get most of their revenue from government-mandated security testing.  It poses a risk to the integrity of our products that we are not willing to accept,  she said. Without the source code approval, Symantec can no longer get approval to sell some of its business-oriented security products in Russia.  As a result, we do minimal business there,  she said. Markov declined to comment on Symantec’s decision, citing a non-disclosure agreement with the company. Trusted Labs Over the past year, HP has used Echelon to allow FSTEC to review source code, according to the agency's records. A company spokesman declined to comment. An IBM spokesman confirmed the company allows Russia to review its source code in secure, company-controlled facilities  where strict procedures are followed.  FSTEC certification records showed the Information Security Center, an independent testing company based outside Moscow, has reviewed IBM’s source code on behalf of the agency. The company was founded more than 20 years ago under the auspices of an institute within Russia’s Ministry of Defense, according to its website. The company did not respond to requests for comment. In a statement, McAfee said the Russia code reviews were conducted  at  certified testing labs  at company-owned premises in the United States. SAP allows Russia to review and test source code in a secure SAP facility in Germany, according to a person familiar with the process. In a company statement, SAP said the review process assures Russian customers “their SAP software investments are safe and secure.” Cisco has recently allowed Russia to review source code, according to a person familiar with the matter. A Cisco spokeswoman declined to comment on the company's interactions with Russian authorities but said the firm does sometimes allow regulators to inspect small parts of its code in  trusted  independent labs and that the reviews do not compromise the security of its products. Before allowing the reviews, Cisco scrutinizes the code to ensure they are not exposing vulnerabilities that could be used to hack the products, she said.

By staking out the position, the left-leaning SPD is taking the same stance as the environmentalist Greens, who could be a kingmaker in three potential coalitions after the Sept. 24 election - one of them involving the SPD.  Whatever the coalition, if the SPD is going to be in the next government, we will implement marriage for all within the first 100 days,  Heil told the newspaper Rheinische Post in comments published on Friday. Gay marriage is a step up from the civil partnerships Germany has allowed since 2001. It has been resisted by Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservative Christian Democratic Party (CDU) and their Bavarian allies. However, a study by Germany's Federal Anti-Discrimination Agency in January found that 83 percent of Germans supported legal equality for same-sex marriage. The SPD is a junior partner in a  grand coalition  with Merkel's conservatives in the incumbent government. An opinion poll published on Friday put support for Merkel's conservatives on 39 percent, far ahead of the SPD on 25 percent.

Russia's defense ministry said a week ago it believed it may have killed Baghdadi when one of its air strikes hit a gathering of senior Islamic State commanders on the outskirts of the Syrian city of Raqqa. But armed groups fighting in the region and U.S. officials say they have no evidence that Baghdadi was killed, and many regional officials have said they are skeptical about the information from Moscow. Committee head Viktor Ozerov was quoted as saying the defense ministry would not have released information about Baghdadi's death if it believed it could be later proved incorrect.  I think this information is close to 100 percent,  Interfax quoted Ozerov as saying.  The fact that Islamic State has still not shown him anywhere also adds to our confidence that al-Baghdadi has been killed.  Baghdadi has frequently been reported killed or wounded since he declared a caliphate from a mosque in Mosul in 2014, after leading his fighters on a sweep through northern Iraq. His death would be one of the biggest blows yet to the jihadist group, which is trying to defend its shrinking territory in Syria and Iraq against forces backed by regional and global powers.

The government will introduce legislation to incorporate EU laws into the domestic statute book from the day Britain leaves the union, which is expected to be in 2019. This has been described as Britain's biggest ever legislative challenge because it must convert more than 12,000 EU regulations into British law -- a step seen as necessary to ensure continuity for businesses trading across EU borders. Though some British politicians and business leaders voted to leave the EU to reform or abolish some EU laws, a report by law firm Linklaters for a group funded by TheCityUK, Britain's most powerful financial lobby group, warns the government against making changes when transferring them into domestic law. The report says that an attempt to complete the exercise in less than the two years before Britain is scheduled to leave the EU could be  an overwhelming task  and create gaps in the law,  undermining legal stability.      The government is considering a line-by-line approach to amending the laws, which would leave businesses and lawyers struggling to track the number of changes, the report says.  Given the scale of the task ... we urge government to refrain from using this exercise to make policy changes, except where necessary as a direct consequence of Brexit,  the copy of the report reviewed by Reuters says. TheCityUK declined to comment. Linklaters did not respond to a request for comment. The report is due to be published on Tuesday. Opposition parties are already objecting to the government's plan to rely on so-called  Henry VIII powers , named after the 16th-century monarch who ruled by proclamation. These would help the government to change the legislation with limited parliamentary scrutiny. The financial services sector, Britain's most profitable industry, is subject to detailed and technical legislation that could be undermined by individual amendments, the report says, adding that a statutory body should be created to deal with any unintended consequences or errors.  The scope and scale of the exercise is unprecedented,  the report says.  It is inevitable that some issues will slip through the net and throw up illogicalities, gaps or ambiguities.

The ruling party will propose a new prime minister to the president on Monday and, if he endorses the candidate, a new government could be formed within days, reducing political uncertainty.      If President Klaus Iohannis, a centrist, rejects the new - as yet unknown - candidate, more instability and prolonged policy gridlock could follow, analysts said. This could boost volatility in local markets and weigh on the leu.     On Friday the leu firmed 0.2 percent to trade at around 4.57 to the euro, but was still hovering around its weakest levels since 2012 of 4.599 hit earlier this week.      EUR/RON hovers at elevated levels not seen since 2012 on political uncertainty and the concerns regarding fiscal discipline,  Raiffeisen said in a note.       With consultations starting on Monday to form a new government and with the uncertainty how the President could react to any nominee, the leu is expected to remain volatile over the coming week.      Prime Minister Sorin Grindeanu fell in a no-confidence vote initiated by his own party, which is controlled by political adversary Liviu Dragnea.      Dragnea is expected to come up with a new candidate by Monday in time for Iohannis to consider his choice.     Iohannis has said he will only approve a candidate who has a clean criminal record - something that prevents Dragnea, who has a conviction for vote rigging, from taking the top job himself.     Other currencies in the region moved little.      The sell-off of the Polish currency, which had been seen since the start of the week was halted on Thursday. The zloty showed some gains against the euro and the dollar,  BZ WBK analysts in a note.      While in the morning EURPLN went above 4.26, another positive monthly data on budget performance and a successful switch auction helped the zloty to turn the tide.       Poland posted the smallest central budget deficit in at least 18 years in the first five months of 2017 as value added tax (VAT) revenue jumped by a nearly a third compared to the previous year, the finance ministry said on Thursday.

Australia's largest city was also considering more permanent measures such as bollards, garden beds or other landscaping features in Martin Place, which houses a war memorial, the headquarters of the Reserve Bank of Australia, the U.S. Consulate General, a hotel and many luxury retail outlets.  There was no specific threat to Sydney, police in New South Wales state said in a statement. Earlier this month, a van ploughed into worshippers near a London mosque, the third such attack in the city since March. A car also crashed into pedestrians in New York City's bustling Times Square, killing one and injuring 22.  A significant amount of work has been undertaken around vehicle mitigation strategies, including studies of world's best practice, which have been shared with all the relevant partners,  the police spokesman said.  Ultimately, the advice from police involves balancing the management of risk against the need for the public to enjoy access to public spaces,  he said. Sydney's city council said it was working with police to determine if additional bollards or barricades were required in other public places.  About 140 concrete bollards were erected in eight  pedestrian locations around the center of Melbourne, Australia's second-largest city, to reduce the risk of militant acts, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported. Australia has been on a  high  national threat level since 2015, citing the likelihood of attacks by Australians radicalized in Iraq and Syria. A staunch ally of the United States and its campaign against the Islamic State group in Syria and Iraq, Australia believes more than 100 of its citizens are fighting there. Two hostages were killed during a 17-hour siege by a  lone wolf  gunman in a popular cafe in Martin Place in December 2014. Five people were killed and scores injured after a 26-year old man drove a car into a crowd of pedestrians on a busy street in Melbourne in January this year. The incident was not terror-related, officials said. Reporting by Swati Pandey; Editing by Paul Tait","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-australia-security-sydney-idUSKBN19E0VE"},

By staking out the position, the left-leaning SPD is taking the same stance as the environmentalist Greens, who could be a kingmaker in three potential coalitions after the Sept. 24 election - one of them involving the SPD.  Whatever the coalition, if the SPD is going to be in the next government, we will implement marriage for all within the first 100 days,  Heil told the newspaper Rheinische Post in comments published on Friday. Gay marriage is a step up from the civil partnerships Germany has allowed since 2001. It has been resisted by Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservative Christian Democratic Party (CDU) and their Bavarian allies. However, a study by Germany's Federal Anti-Discrimination Agency in January found that 83 percent of Germans supported legal equality for same-sex marriage. The SPD is a junior partner in a  grand coalition  with Merkel's conservatives in the incumbent government. An opinion poll published on Friday put support for Merkel's conservatives on 39 percent, far ahead of the SPD on 25 percent.

Former president Khieu Samphan, 85, and Khmer Rouge  Brother Number Two  Nuon Chea, 90, face charges of crimes against humanity and genocide in the second case before a U.N.-backed tribunal known as the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia. The pair were among a small clique, led by Pol Pot, of mostly French-educated communists who rose to lead a bloody revolution against a U.S.-backed government after their country was engulfed by the Vietnam War. Their regime sought to turn Cambodia back to  year zero  in its quest for a peasant utopia. Most of the victims of the Khmer Rouge died of starvation, torture, exhaustion or disease in labor camps or were bludgeoned to death during mass executions in  killing fields . Khieu Samphan and co-defendant Nuon Chea are the last two surviving members of the top leadership clique. Pol Pot,  Brother Number One , died in 1998.  The term 'murder', I categorically reject it,  Khieu Samphan told the court in the final stage of the trial.  The Communist People of Kampuchea leaders did not exterminate our people. What was the interest in so doing?  Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea were found guilty of crimes against humanity in the fist phase of the complex trial and sentenced to life in prison in 2014. Former Khmer Rouge leader Khieu Samphan attends the closing statement in case 002/02 against former Khmer Rouge leaders Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan, at the courtroom of the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia (ECCC), on the outskirts of Phnom Penh, Cambodia, June 23, 2017. Nhet Sok Heng/Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia/Handout via REUTERSThe Khmer Rouge split amidst bloody purges of their ranks during their rule and many members from eastern zones fled to neighboring Vietnam to return with a Vietnamese army in December 1978, which ousted the Khmer Rouge and sent them fleeing to the border with Thailand. Ever since, the Khmer Rouge have blamed Vietnam for the disaster of their rule. Khieu Samphan repeated that on Friday saying Vietnam had invented the notion of genocide as propaganda to justify their  invasion with the  blessing of the current Cambodian leaders . Slideshow (5 Images) Vietnam has never cooperated with this tribunal and finally it has invented the unacceptable idea of the Cambodian genocide,  he said. Many of Cambodia's current leaders, including veteran Prime Minister Hun Sen, were members of the Khmer Rouge who fled to Vietnam and were later installed in a Vietnamese-backed government in Phnom Penh. Nuon Chea did not appear at the hearing on Friday due to  back pain , the court was told. He followed proceedings via a live video link to a holding cell. Khieu Samphan said people were forced to work in labor camps because of  the immediate need to solve the problem of hunger , adding:  Is this something criminal? Of course not.  Nuon Chea's international defense lawyer, Victor Koppe, said the proceedings against his client were  a show trial ... to serve the interest of the American and Vietnamese aggressors . After being forced from power, the Khmer Rouge became part of a U.N.-recognized and U.S.-backed government in exile that opposed the decade-long occupation of Cambodia by Soviet-backed Vietnam. The tribunal has not set a date for a verdict. Reporting by Prak Chan Thul; Editing by Robert Birsel","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-cambodia-rouge-idUSKBN19E0UO"},

The sale took the overall return for the state from AIB to nearly half the 21 billion euros spent to bail the bank out after a massive property crash in 2009, the biggest bill for any Irish lender still trading. The state ended up with 99.9 percent of AIB and has been nursing it back to health, with the aim of eventually recouping all the taxpayer money it ploughed into the lender, one of three it managed to save in the euro zone's most costly state rescue. The initial public offering (IPO) of 25 percent of AIB's shares at 4.40 euros each was the third largest European bank listing since the financial crisis and the biggest IPO of any kind in London by market capitalization in almost six years.  The successful completion today of AIB's IPO represents a significant milestone,  Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe said of the long-awaited share sale his predecessor Michael Noonan launched in May.  This successful IPO has created a strong platform for the state to recover all the money it has invested in AIB and to further dispose of our banking investments for the benefit of the Irish people,  Donohoe said. In the biggest test yet of investor appetite for the Irish banking sector since the crisis, the AIB shares on offer were four times oversubscribed and sold at the midpoint of an initial 3.90 euro to 4.90 euro range set last week. The sale price valued the bank at 11.9 billion euros, meaning investors only received a 3 percent discount to the bank's book value of 12.3 billion euros at the end of 2016 - or 0.97 times tangible book value. That put AIB shares at a premium to its main Irish rival Bank of Ireland BKIR.I, which trades at 0.87 times book value, and toward the level of European rivals such as Lloyds (LLOY.L) and ABN Amro (ABNd.AS).  Landmark Day  Shares in the bank ALBT.I ALBT.L climbed 7 percent to 4.71 euros in unofficial trading ahead of next Tuesday's formal debut on the Dublin and London stock exchanges.  Although the valuation only leaves around 7 percent upside versus our target price, we believe the potential for special dividends, excess capital and strong top down dynamics in Ireland are likely to be supportive of the stock price,  Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analyst Daragh Quinn wrote in a note. Like Ireland's economy, which is growing faster than any other in Europe, AIB has staged a strong recovery, posting a profit for each of the last three years and becoming the first domestically owned lender to restart dividends since the crash. The return for the state from the IPO, together with the amount AIB has repaid in capital, fees, dividends and coupons since its bailout, now comes to almost 10 billion euros.  This is a landmark day for the bank,  AIB chief executive Bernard Byrne said in a statement.  The level of investor interest and support is a great vote of confidence in the strength of the turnaround in the bank and the wider economy.   Ireland pumped 64 billion euros into its banks and expects to turn a profit on the half given to the three that survived. Noonan said last month it would probably take eight to 10 years to return AIB fully to private ownership. The government will use Friday's proceeds to cut some 1.5 percent from a national debt that at 200 billion euros is still among the highest in the euro zone by most measures. As the deal also includes a greenshoe, or over-allotment option, the size of the IPO could rise to 28.75 percent if demand proves higher than expected following AIB's debut - and add another 400 million euros to state coffers.

The market hit an 18-month high on Thursday in the wake of the decision. But the yuan was set for its biggest weekly fall since early March, down 0.4 percent, hampered by higher corporate demand for dollars and weaker guidance from the central bank. MSCI's emerging stocks index gained 0.2 percent and was set for its best weekly performance in a month, up 0.7 percent, with index heavyweight South Korea hovering near an all-time high.  Emerging markets are being helped by the fact (U.S.) Treasuries are holding very well -- the 10 year was 2.60 percent in mid-March and it is now 2.16,  said Regis Chatellier, sovereign credit analyst at Societe Generale.  There is not much pressure from the Fed side so people are happy with that. Also the growth trend in emerging markets is positive.  Emerging equities have attracted $1.7 billion this week and emerging bonds $2.2 billion, according to JP Morgan. Cumulative year-to-date inflows now stand at $40.2 billion for equities and $62.5 billion for bonds. The strong investor appetite has allowed Argentina to sell a century bond whilst Belarus, rated B-/Caa1, raised $1.4 billion, with a 10-year tranche at 7.625 percent The average yield spread of emerging sovereign dollar bonds over U.S. Treasuries has fallen 26 basis points since the start of the year to 314 basis points, but Chatellier did not expect this to tighten much further.  For them to get tighter we need to have commodities going stronger,  he said. The South African rand firmed 0.4 percent after parliament said it would launch a court challenge against an anti-graft watchdog's recommendation of constitutional changes to alter the central bank's mandate. The rand is still down 0.8 percent for the week after the threat to the South African Reserve Bank's independence. But stocks rose 0.3 percent and look set to end the week up 1.3 percent. Investors have also taken heart from a constitutional court ruling that parliament can hold a secret ballot in a no-confidence vote against President Jacob Zuma. Russian stocks lost 0.2 percent, but were set to end the week up around 1.8 percent, rebounding after last week's 3.2 percent sell off. Russian dollar-denominated stocks were still down 1.1 percent for the week, after touching their lowest level since November 2016. A low oil price is weighing on producers, with Brent futures set for their worst first-half decline in two decades. But the rouble firmed 0.7 percent, helped by oil prices edging back above $45 a barrel. Overnight Mexico's central bank raised interest rates by a quarter percentage point to 7 percent, as expected, but hinted this could be the last rise. The peso firmed 0.3 percent against the dollar after gaining around 0.7 percent on Thursday.

Analysts from Japanese bank Nomura on Thursday flipped to calling for a rise in rates within six months, after the defection over the past week of three members of the BoE's policy committee to the camp backing higher rates. Policy hawk, Kristin Forbes, in her last speech before leaving the bank, urged colleagues on Thursday evening to raise rates immediately to quell the inflation pressure stemming from a weaker pound.  It is not our view - we think rates will be on hold for the next year - but the market has definitely started pricing in the chance of a hike in the next six months,  said Rabobank strategist Piotr Matys.  That is clearly giving sterling some support.  Short-term UK market interest rates have shifted since a speech by the Bank's chief economist, Andy Haldane, earlier this week, with short sterling pricing in a strong chance of a rise in rates by December. That puts aside the doubts of many that the UK economy - and household demand - are currently ill-equipped to swallow higher interest rates.  We're not here to tell the BOE what they should do, we're here to figure out what they are most likely to do,  Nomura's Jordan Rochester said in a note to clients.  Whilst it may not be in line with Governor Carney's Mansion House speech, we ... now expect the MPC to raise rates for the first time in a decade at its next meeting in August.

The sale took the overall return for the state from AIB to nearly half the 21 billion euros spent to bail the bank out after a massive property crash in 2009, the biggest bill for any Irish lender still trading. The state ended up with 99.9 percent of AIB and has been nursing it back to health, with the aim of eventually recouping all the taxpayer money it ploughed into the lender, one of three it managed to save in the euro zone's most costly state rescue. The initial public offering (IPO) of 25 percent of AIB's shares at 4.40 euros each was the third largest European bank listing since the financial crisis and the biggest IPO of any kind in London by market capitalization in almost six years.  The successful completion today of AIB's IPO represents a significant milestone,  Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe said of the long-awaited share sale his predecessor Michael Noonan launched in May.  This successful IPO has created a strong platform for the state to recover all the money it has invested in AIB and to further dispose of our banking investments for the benefit of the Irish people,  Donohoe said. In the biggest test yet of investor appetite for the Irish banking sector since the crisis, the AIB shares on offer were four times oversubscribed and sold at the midpoint of an initial 3.90 euro to 4.90 euro range set last week. The sale price valued the bank at 11.9 billion euros, meaning investors only received a 3 percent discount to the bank's book value of 12.3 billion euros at the end of 2016 - or 0.97 times tangible book value. That put AIB shares at a premium to its main Irish rival Bank of Ireland BKIR.I, which trades at 0.87 times book value, and toward the level of European rivals such as Lloyds (LLOY.L) and ABN Amro (ABNd.AS).  Landmark Day  Shares in the bank ALBT.I ALBT.L climbed 7 percent to 4.71 euros in unofficial trading ahead of next Tuesday's formal debut on the Dublin and London stock exchanges.  Although the valuation only leaves around 7 percent upside versus our target price, we believe the potential for special dividends, excess capital and strong top down dynamics in Ireland are likely to be supportive of the stock price,  Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analyst Daragh Quinn wrote in a note. Like Ireland's economy, which is growing faster than any other in Europe, AIB has staged a strong recovery, posting a profit for each of the last three years and becoming the first domestically owned lender to restart dividends since the crash. The return for the state from the IPO, together with the amount AIB has repaid in capital, fees, dividends and coupons since its bailout, now comes to almost 10 billion euros.  This is a landmark day for the bank,  AIB chief executive Bernard Byrne said in a statement.  The level of investor interest and support is a great vote of confidence in the strength of the turnaround in the bank and the wider economy.   Ireland pumped 64 billion euros into its banks and expects to turn a profit on the half given to the three that survived. Noonan said last month it would probably take eight to 10 years to return AIB fully to private ownership. The government will use Friday's proceeds to cut some 1.5 percent from a national debt that at 200 billion euros is still among the highest in the euro zone by most measures. As the deal also includes a greenshoe, or over-allotment option, the size of the IPO could rise to 28.75 percent if demand proves higher than expected following AIB's debut - and add another 400 million euros to state coffers.

But with inflation relatively resilient and overall growth still quite strong, pressure will likely be maintained on policymakers at the European Central Bank to pare back soon on their ultra-loose monetary policy. Earlier this month, the ECB gave up its bias for more rate cuts in a small step towards normalization. IHS Markit's Flash Composite Purchasing Managers' Index for June fell to 55.7 from the 56.8 it registered in April and May, which was its highest since April 2011. A reading above 50 indicates growth. A Reuters poll had predicted no change to the index, seen as a good guide to growth, and none of the economists polled had predicted such a big fall.  At the moment I'm not too worried about it,  said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.  We may be reaching the stage where growth has been strong for quite a few months and we are hitting a few ceilings in terms of degrees to which firms can expand capacity.     Williamson said the PMI pointed to second quarter GDP growth of 0.7 percent, faster than the 0.5 percent predicted in a Reuters poll earlier this month. The PMIs had correctly indicated a 0.6 percent expansion last quarter.  Economic data points to solid growth in the euro zone in the second quarter and inflation will hover near current levels in coming months, the ECB said in a regular economic bulletin on Thursday. As they have done for the previous seven months, firms increased prices in June, albeit at a weaker pace as input cost pressures eased. The output prices index dipped to 51.8 from 52.4. Firms operating in the bloc's dominant service industry did not perform as expected. The services PMI fell to 54.7 from 56.3, well below even the most pessimistic forecaster in a Reuters poll of over 40 economists.  It's not really clear what that's about, there was no single cause we can pinpoint and I'm inclined to treat it just as some payback for the sheer strength of growth in recent months,  Williamson said. In one bright spot, the employment index held at May's 53.8. It has only been higher than that once since early 2008, in March of this year. Factories had a better month than predicted. The manufacturing PMI climbed to a more than six-year high of 57.3 from 57.0. The Reuters poll suggested it would dip to 56.8. An index measuring output nudged up to 58.5 from 58.3, its highest since April 2011. Implying the momentum would continue into July, new orders surged and factories ran down stocks of finished goods at the fastest rate for nine months. The related subindex sank to 47.9 from 49.1.

The minister, Gerard Collomb, visited the port city on Friday and earlier said extra police would be drafted into the area. French authorities sent in bulldozers last year to clear a migrant camp known as the Jungle, where thousands of migrants hoping to cross the Channel to Britain lived in squalid conditions. Many of them were sent to lodgings around France. Collomb took a firm line during a visit, saying a new centre would recreate the situation that existed before the Jungle camp, considered a public health risk, was demolished.  We don't want to create a gathering point where numbers would swell back up to 7,000 over time. That would not be tolerable, for the migrants, the residents of Calais and for economic life,  he told reporters on arrival. Aid agencies say about 400-600 migrants are once again gathered and sleeping rough on streets. Before it was demolished, the Jungle camp had become a symbol of Europe's difficulty in dealing with the migrant crisis. Charities had warned the Socialist government at the time that migrants would return. Newly elected President Emmanuel Macron and his centrist government have come under pressure from the human rights watchdog which has described conditions facing migrants in Calais as  inhuman .  Refugees make up 0.25 percent of Europe's population. Can we really not look after them ?  Jacques Toubon, head of the national human rights watchdog, said on RTL radio.  These people are equal in dignity, equal in their rights ... and France's legal obligation is to accord them basic human rights.  Macron has instructed local officials to treat migrants more humanely, government spokesman Christophe Castaner said, and he has also asked Collomb to see to it that asylum requests are processed within six months. Collomb told the regional Nord Littoral newspaper that he was sending additional mobile police units to the Calais area. Earlier this month, two French charities accused police of using excessive force against migrants and preventing aid groups from distributing meals. Many migrants set on crossing the short stretch of sea from Calais to Britain, try to do so by slipping inside the cargo holds of large trucks bound for English shores.

A committee of large international banks on Thursday voted to adopt an interest rate benchmark from the U.S. Treasuries-backed repurchase agreement market (repo) as an alternative to the use of Libor (London Interbank Offered Rates) in around $150 trillion worth of derivatives.  I think everyone will take this as a reasonable conclusion,  said the head of derivatives trading at a Japanese brokerage.  The repo market is the biggest short-term interest rate market.  The decision was made by the Alternative Reference Rates Committee  (AARC), a group of private firms tasked with selecting a new rate at the behest of regulators. The move came after the Financial Stability Board, a global financial regulation oversight body, recommended reform of interest rate benchmarks following the 2012 scandal on Libor's fixing. Repo rates are deemed more transparent because they reflect actual traded rates, compared to Libor, which are based on rates reported by traders and are prone to misreporting and manipulation. Yet some hurdles remain for the new benchmark rates.  Most repo trading is for a short period. It doesn't look realistic to have a yield curve stretching to six to nine months immediately,  said a senior executive at U.S. brokerage in Tokyo. An Impact in Asia? Indeed, few market players expect Libor to disappear any time soon, given the huge amount of existing derivative transactions, such as interest rate swaps, that use Libor as reference rate. The AARC decision is unlikely to have significant impact on benchmarks in Asia-Pacific in the near term, market players said. In Tokyo, a study group concluded in December that Japan will use unsecured overnight call rate as the benchmark. But some market players say the global benchmark reform could reignite debate on Tokyo Interbank Offered Rates (Tibor), which are often criticised as being kept artificially high to benefit banks making commercial loans at Tibor-linked rates. Australian authorities changed the method to calculate the benchmark bank bill swap rate (BBSW) in November. Their administration is due to be transferred in August to the Australian Securities Exchange from a financial industry group.  The changes in the United States with the use of the Libor have no direct impact on BBSW in Australia – they are different benchmarks with different inputs,  ASX spokesman Matthew Gibbs told Reuters.  However, this is consistent with a move by regulators around the world, including in Australia, to encourage the development of alternative benchmarks to provide markets with greater choice,  he added.

The Outlook is Stable. The agency has also downgraded Multipolar's senior unsecured rating and USD230 million notes due 2018 to 'B-' from 'B', with Recovery Rating of 'RR4'. The notes were issued by Pacific Emerald Pte Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary, and guaranteed by Multipolar and certain subsidiaries. At the same time, Fitch Ratings Indonesia has downgraded the National Long-Term Rating to 'BBB-(idn)' from 'BBB+(idn)'. The Outlook is Stable. The downgrade reflects our expectation of Multipolar's weaker credit profile on account of persistently weak performance from PT Matahari Putra Prima Tbk (MPPA) for the next two years due to increasing mini-market format competition. Cash flow pressure from weakening margins along with capex requirements for store expansion will affect MPPA's shareholder distribution ability. This will make Multipolar more reliant on dividends from PT Matahari Department Store Tbk (MDS). We expect Multipolar's fixed-charge coverage to remain below 1.0x in 2017 and 2018, as measured by (consolidated Multipolar EBITDA - MPPA EBITDA + dividends + rent)/(adjusted interest + rent). 'BBB' National Ratings denote a moderate default risk relative to other issuers or obligations in the same country. However, changes in circumstances or economic conditions are more likely to affect the capacity for timely repayment than is the case for financial commitments denoted by a higher rated category. KEY RATING DRIVERS Persistently Weaker MPPA Performance: Multipolar's weaker credit profile reflects our expectation of sustained pressure on MPPA's pre-dividend free cash flows from increasing mini-market format competition, store expansion targets and a rising need for promotional activity to support store traffic. MPPA continued to suffer from negative same-store sales growth of -6.9% in 1Q17 (2016: -4.5%) and a higher operating expense ratio of 20.9% (2016: 15.8%), leading to negative EBITDA of -IDR126 billion in 1Q17 (1Q16: -IDR23 billion). Solid Profile of MDS: The solid financial performance of MDS ensures stable dividends for Multipolar. MDS had ample liquidity at end-2016, with a IDR1.7 trillion cash balance and no interest-bearing debt on its balance sheet. We expect MDS to generate a stable profit margin, with an EBITDA margin of around 16% and net profit margin of 11%. MDS distributed 70% of net income as dividends in 2016 and we expect stable dividend upstream in 2017 and 2018. Fitch sees the business profile of MDS as supportive to Multipolar's rating given MDS's market leadership status in Indonesia's department store business and benign competition in the non-food retail segment. Decreasing Fixed-Charge Coverage: Fitch expects fixed-charge coverage to decline to below 1.0x in 2017 and 2018 - our previous threshold for negative rating action. Multipolar's subsidiaries, with the exception of PT Multipolar Technology Tbk (MLPT), have been generating volatile EBITDA. An improvement in MPPA-deconsolidated EBITDA will depend on an immediate turnaround of Multipolar's China operation, significant expansion of its other small businesses and stable performance from its property management companies. We expect the ratio to remain low from a combination of persistent weakening in MPPA performance and profit volatility at most of its subsidiaries. Large Cash Balance: Liquidity at Multipolar holding company level will be supported by an ample cash balance of around IDR1.7 trillion at end-2016 from the sale of a 3% stake in MDS in September 2016. We estimate that the strong cash balance and steady dividend upstream from MDS will be adequate to cover holding company expenses and interest costs in 2017 and 2018, as the IDR120 billion short-term revolving facility was fully utilised at end-2016. Manageable Refinancing Risk: The rating takes into account our expectation that Multipolar's management is proactively addressing the maturity of the USD230 million senior unsecured notes in July 2018 and is currently in discussions with lenders. Dividend Reliance: Multipolar's rating reflects the structural subordination that arises from its group structure. Multipolar is a holding company that owns majority stakes in companies involved in businesses such as retail, IT services (MLPT) and property management (PT Matahari Pasific (MP) and PT Nadya Putra Investama (NPI)). Most of Multipolar's cash flow is generated from upstream stream of dividends from its investment in Indonesian retailers, MPPA and MDS, of which Multipolar owns 50.2% and 17.48%, respectively. DERIVATION SUMMARY Credit metrics and cash flows of Mutlipolar rely on dividend inflow from subsidiaries, similarly to PT Indika Energy Tbk (B-/Stable). Indika's dividends mostly come from its coal mining company, PT Kideco Jaya Agung, while Multipolar's dividends come from its non-food retail operation, MDS. Both companies have an adequate cash balance at the holding company level to fund short-term operations and expenses. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: - 10% revenue growth per annum (2016: -10%) and a stable EBITDA margin of around 9%-10% for MLPT for 2017-2018 (2016: 11%) - Annual capex of IDR300 billion-400 billion for subsidiaries other than MPPA from 2017 to 2018 - Stable dividends upstream from MDS in 2017 and 2018 RATING SENSITIVITIES Developments that May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action - Fixed-charge coverage, adjusted for MPPA deconsolidation and dividends, rising above 1.0x on a sustained basis Developments that May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action - Weakening liquidity as indicated by significant decline in cash balance or weaker access to banking facilities - Deterioration in MDS operating performance that would limit its ability to pay dividend LIQUIDITY Adequate Short-Term Liquidity: Multipolar had more than IDR3.4 trillion in cash against the IDR96 billion maturity of long-term debt and IDR504 billion maturity of its short-term revolving loan at end-2016. We expect subsidiaries, such as MPPA, MLPT, MP, NPI and PT Multifiling Mitra Indonesia Tbk, will be able to manage their liquidity comfortably given their adequate credit metrics. On the other hand, we expect the credit facility at weaker subsidiary, PT Kharisma Artha Sejati, to continue being rolled-over.

The United States assessed that the test, the latest in a series of engine and missile trials this year, could be for the smallest stage of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) rocket engine, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. A second U.S. official also confirmed the test but did not provide additional details on the type of rocket component that was being tested or whether it fit into the ICBM program. One official said he believed the test had taken place within the past 24 hours. North Korea's state media, which is normally quick to publicize successful missile-related developments, did not carry any reports on the engine test.  South Korean officials did not have details about the reported test and declined to comment on the possible nature of the engine. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said China opposed any action that violated UN Security Council resolutions and called for restraint from all parties. South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who was elected last month on a platform of a more moderate approach to Pyongyang including dialogue to ease tension, inspected the test-launch of a ballistic missile on Friday that is being developed by the South's military.  I believe in dialogue, but dialogue is possible when it's backed by strong defense and engagement policy is possible only when we have security ability that can overwhelm the North,  Moon was quoted by his office as saying at the test site. Moon's office did not disclose the details of the missile being tested, but South Korea has been working to develop ballistic missiles with a range of 800 km (500 miles), a voluntary cap under an agreement with the United States. The United States has tried for years to discourage South Korea from developing longer-range ballistic missiles in keeping with the Missile Technology Control Regime, a voluntary international arms-control pact. China Pressed to Exert Pressure  The disclosure of the North's engine test came a day after the United States pressed China to exert more economic and diplomatic pressure on North Korea to help rein in its nuclear and missile programs during a round of high-level talks in Washington. A North Korean flag is pictured at its embassy in Beijing January 6, 2016.Kim Kyung-HoonMoon told Reuters in an exclusive interview on Thursday that strong new sanctions would be needed if the North conducted a new nuclear test or an intercontinental ballistic missile test and that he planned to call on Chinese President Xi Jinping to play a greater role in reining in Pyongyang's arms program. However, the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman questioned such calls.  When the world says that it hopes China can do even more, I don't know what 'do even more' refers to,  Geng told a daily news briefing in Beijing on Friday.  We've said many times that China is making unremitting efforts to resolve the Korean peninsula nuclear issue, and plays an active and constructive role,  he said.  U.S. President Donald Trump has warned that a  major, major conflict  with North Korea is possible over its weapons programs, although U.S. officials say tougher sanctions, not military force, are the preferred option. China's top diplomat, Yang Jiechi, told Trump in a meeting at the White House that Beijing was willing to  maintain communication and coordination  with the United States in an effort to defuse tension on the Korean peninsula, according to a statement from China's Foreign Ministry on Friday. The head of the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency told Congress last month that North Korea, if left unchecked, was on an  inevitable  path to obtaining a nuclear-armed missile capable of striking the U.S. mainland. However, experts say Pyongyang could still be years away from have a reliable ICBM capability. The continental United States is around 5,600 miles (9,000 km) from North Korea. ICBMs have a minimum range of about 3,400 miles (5,500 km), but some are designed to travel 6,200 miles (10,000 km) or farther. Any military solution to the North Korea crisis would be  tragic on an unbelievable scale , Trump's defense secretary, Jim Mattis, said last month.  The United States, meanwhile, is ramping up capabilities to defend against the threat from North Korea, staging its first-ever successful test to intercept an incoming ICBM-type missile in May. But a test on June 21 of a new capability being developed by the United States and Japan to defend against shorter-range missiles failed to hit its target, the U.S. Missile Defense Agency said on Thursday. It was the second such test of the SM-3 Block IIA interceptor, which is being developed by Raytheon (RTN.N). The previous intercept test, conducted in February, had been successful.

In addition to grenade-thrower Jeremy Bailly, the jury court sentenced eight others to prison for between 12 and 20 years, with the lengthier terms handed to two men who spent time in Syria, where the Islamic State militant group has its base.  The convictions in a late night ruling on Thursday brought a close to an affair that predated the spate of Islamist-inspired attacks in France from early 2015 onwards, in which more than 230 people have been killed. Another member of the jihadist cell - Jeremie Louis-Sidney - died in a shootout with police when they tried to arrest him in the eastern French city of Strasbourg in October 2012. The grenade-attack at a Jewish food store in Sarcelles north of Paris the same year injured one person but killed nobody, an outcome prosecutors described as  a miracle . The dismantling of the cell allowed police to thwart another attack planned against an army camp in the Var area of southern France in 2013, prosecutors said. They added that the cell, half of whose members were converts to Islam who bonded on a camping holiday in Cannes, southern France, had also planned but not executed an attack on a McDonald's fast-food restaurant. In all, the trial concerned 20 people. Two were acquitted. Among others sentenced was a 23-year-old Laotian man who was judged as the driver of the car from which Bailly hurled the grenade. He was jailed for 18 years. Among others sentenced but not present in court were a man who joined the Islamic State militant group in Syria and thought to have possibly died there, and another on the run in Africa.

The Outlook is Stable. A full list of rating actions is at the end of this commentary. The affirmation reflects Jinmao's continued strong performance in its property development business, which is driven by its good quality land bank and strong positioning in Tier-1 and 2 cities. The rating is also supported by Jinmao's recovery in recurring EBITDA interest coverage, primary land sales strength and moderate leverage. KEY RATING DRIVERS Strong Property Sales: Jinmao's total sales from property development rose 35% to CNY37.5 billion in 2016 and gained another 38% to CNY14.9 billion in the first five months in 2017 amid tighter property market regulations. Fitch expects Jinmao to maintain robust sales growth in the next 18 months, supported by CNY85 billion of saleable resources in 2017, of which 40% will come from Tier 1 cities. Jinmao's cash collection is also healthy at above 90%. Jinmao's landbank quality is strong - it had 12.5 million square metres (sqm) of land on an attributable basis at end-2016, most of which is in Tier 1 and 2 cities. Temporary Higher Leverage: Fitch expects Jinmao's net leverage, measured by net debt/adjusted inventory, to temporarily edge above 35% by end-2017 as Jinmao's land acquisition didn't slow down in 1H17 and the company also has to pay the CNY10 billion land premium from 2016. Jinmao acquired land through auctions in Tier 1 and 2 cities worth a total of CNY31.2 billion in 2016 and CNY20.2 billion in 1H17. The attributable land premium was as high as 90% of total attributable sales in 2016. However, Fitch does not expect Jinmao to continue buying land aggressively in 2018 after two years landbanking as its landbank is already sufficient for about 10 years' of development. However, any continued aggressive acquisitions may result in sustaining leverage at high levels, although the increase in risks may be mitigated if they are accompanied by a substantial rise in contracted sales. Net leverage increased to 32.5% from 27.6% at end-2015 on a deconsolidated basis. Recurring Interest Coverage to Improve: Fitch expects Jinmao's recurring interest coverage to bottom out after the negative impact of the Chinese yuan's sharp depreciation and a one-off tenant withdrawal from Jinmao's key investment property in Shanghai  in 2016. The occupancy rate in Jinmao Tower recovered to 95.2% in May 2017 from a historical low of 90.3% last year and the rental rate increased by 4.7% in May 2017 yoy. Furthermore, Fitch expects CNY770 million in rental income to be generated from five new investment properties to be added by end-2017. This 30% increase of recurrent income will help Jinmao's recurring EBITDA coverage to substantially improve to 0.6x in 2018 from 0.4x in 2016 given a more stable Chinese yuan. Jinmao has about 50% of borrowings denominated in US dollars or HK dollars and to date has hedged 6% of its total foreign currency borrowings. Land Development to Stabilise Risks: Jinmao sold five land parcels for CNY11.1 billion in Changsha and Nanjing at a gross margin of as high as 64% in 2016, smoothing out the leverage effect from aggressive landbanking in 2016. The unsold primary land in Meixi Lake Phase 1 would be a stable source of cash for Jinmao as land costs have already been paid and it does not need to incur further development expenditure. Fitch estimates Jinmao can generate another CNY6 billion of cash from selling the rest of Meixi Lake Phase 1. The unsold primary land in Changsha and Nanjing amounted to about 14.4 million sqm at end-2016. Furthermore, the high margins from land sales could offset the potential margin erosion from property development due to the costly land Jinmao bought in the past 12 months. Advantage in Government Linkage: Jinmao's business continues to be supported by its status as a state-owned property company. This provides the company with an advantage in government-led strategic projects, and helps provide strong access to domestic bank funding. This is illustrated by the favourable locations of its investment properties and commercial development projects. DERIVATION SUMMARY Jinmao's scale is similar to other Fitch-rated homebuilders such as Beijing Capital Development Holding (Group) Co., Ltd. (BCDH, BBB-/Stable, standalone profile BB/Stable), Sino-Ocean Group Holding Limited (BBB-/Stable, standalone BB/Stable) and Yuexiu Property Company Limited (BBB-/Stable; standalone profile BB/Stable). Jinmao has product and market diversification that are comparable to these homebuilders, given its attributable contracted sales of CNY34.3 billion and landbank of 12.5m sqm for secondary development. Jinmao exceeds its peers in its higher recurring interest coverage of 0.5x and EBITDA margin above 30%. BCDH has no recurring EBITDA, and Sino-Ocean and Yuexiu have coverage of 0.2x-0.3x. Jinmao's high EBITDA margin also reflects its pricing premium and good quality land bank. BCDH's EBITDA margin is in the high twenties because the majority of its land is concentrated in Beijing while Sino-Ocean and Yuexiu's EBITDA margin is only 20%. In term of leverage, Jinmao is closer to Yuexiu and Sino-Ocean, but much lower compared with BCDH, whose net leverage is as high as 60%. No Country Ceiling or parent/subsidiary linkage aspects affect Jinmao's rating. Companies in this sector are unlikely to be rated above 'BBB+' due to operating environment risks. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: - contracted sales (including primary land sales) to increase by 19% to reach CNY58 billion in 2017 and grow in the low teens in 2018 and 2019 - Gross profit margin of property development to remain above 30% in the next 24 months but decrease to around 20% in 2019 and 2020. - Gross profit margin of land development to remain at 55% in the next 24 months - Investment property and hotel revenue to rise by single digits and EBITDA margin of 40% in the next 24 months RATING SENSITIVITIES The following ratios and numbers apply to Jinmao after the deconsolidation of Jinmao Hotel and Jinmao (China) Hotel Investments and Management Limited (JH), unless specified otherwise. Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action include: - Net debt/adjusted inventory, including investment property, remaining above 35% on a sustained basis (2016: 32.5%) - Substantial decrease in margins and total sales in property development and land development from 2016 - (Recurrent EBITDA + dividends from JH)/gross interest expense falling below 0.5x on a sustained basis (2016: 0.3x) - Reduced ties with state-owned majority stakeholder Sinochem Group Positive: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action include: Attributable contracted sales from project development and land development of over CNY50 billion with strong margins on a sustained basis, while keeping healthy leverage and (recurrent EBITDA + dividends from JH)/gross interest expense at over 1.0x LIQUIDITY Ample Liquidity: The company had CNY18 billion in unrestricted cash and CNY27.4 billion in unused banking facilities as of end-2016.This is enough to cover its CNY12.9 billion in short-term debt. Fitch expects the group to maintain sufficient liquidity to fund development costs, land premium payments and debt obligations during 2017-2019 due to its diversified funding channels from both onshore and offshore capital markets, long-term relationships with onshore and offshore banks and flexible land acquisition strategy.

The Complaint Institute for Financial Services (KiFid) said in a binding appeals ruling that NN Group must compensate the customer for money lost on the 1997 policy as a result, and invited both sides to present estimates. NN Group and other Dutch insurers have been dealing with issues related to these insurance policies, popularly known as  woekerpolissen  for years. The common theme is that customers were not informed how much of their premiums went to actual investments, and how much went to cover insurers' costs. Lawyers for consumer groups have estimated that compensation could run billions of euros. NN Group said the KiFid decision contradicted a 2015 ruling by the European Court of Justice. But the insurer also said:  Given that the appeals ruling is binding, in this individual case, NN will abide by the ruling.   The ruling changes nothing in NN's standpoint that the financial consequences of the investment insurance dossier cannot reliably be estimated or quantified,  it said.

Defence Minister Fikri Isik told Turkish broadcaster NTV that he had not yet seen a request for the closure of the base, but made clear Ankara had no plans to review a 2014 agreement with Qatar which led to it being set up. He was speaking after an official from one of the four Arab states boycotting Qatar over alleged support for terrorism said they had sent Doha a list of 13 demands including closing down the military installation.  If there is such a demand, it will mean interference in bilateral ties,  Isik said, suggesting instead that Turkey might continue to bolster its presence in Qatar. Five armoured vehicles and 23 military personnel arrived in Doha on Thursday in a deployment Turkey's armed forces said was part of a military training and cooperation deal. Some 88 Turkish soldiers were already in Qatar, according to the Hurriyet newspaper. The newspaper said a joint exercise by Turkish and Qatari forces was expected following the Islamic Eid al-Fitr holiday which starts on Sunday, and the number of Turkish soldiers sent to the Gulf state could eventually reach 1,000. An air force contingent was also envisaged, it said.  The strengthening of the Turkish base would be a positive step in terms of the Gulf's security,  Isik said.  Re-evaluating the base agreement with Qatar is not on our agenda.  Turkey, which has long tried to play the role of regional mediator, is also wary of upsetting its other allies in the Gulf, including Saudi Arabia, and Isik said Ankara had hoped that tensions over Qatar could be resolved without a crisis. Isik said Turkey's presence in Qatar should be seen as a benefit for the whole Gulf.  The base in Qatar is both a Turkish base and one that will preserve the security of Qatar and the region,  he said. Turkey's military support for Qatar has been matched by stepped up commercial links. Customs and Trade Minister Bulent Tufenkci said Turkish exports to Qatar have tripled since the four Arab countries began boycotting the Gulf state earlier this month.  Since June 5 exports to Qatar have amounted to $32.5 million. Of this $12.5 million is food. This figure is three times the normal level,  Tufenkci told reporters at a Ramadan fast-breaking dinner on Thursday evening. Turkey has sent more than 100 cargo planes of supplies to Qatar but Economy Minister Nihat Zeybekci has said it was not sustainable to maintain supplies through an air lift.

Through various labour reforms he aims to cut the jobless rate to levels not seen in more than two decades by the end of his five-year term. Moody's said on Monday that the parliamentary majority won on Sunday for Macron's 'En Marche!' eased the path to reform, which is credit positive for the rating. However, it added that the government still faces significant fiscal and economic challenges linked to France's weak growth profile and high government debt.  In France, a positive rating change by Moody's would be premature but a move to the...outlook seems possible given the better GDP growth outlook and subsiding political risks,  said Christoph Rieger, rates strategist at Commerzbank. French 10-year bond yields were a touch lower at just under 0.60 percent on Friday, heading back towards a seven-month low of 0.578 percent hit nine days ago. At 34 basis points, the gap to benchmark German equivalents is around the lowest since November. Other euro zone bond yields were little changed on the day. The chief economist at rival ratings firm S&P; said earlier this month that it is likely to raise its 1.5 percent growth forecast for France. S&P; are not scheduled to review their AA (stable) rating for France until October, but Fitch -- which also praised Macron's parliamentary majority this week -- will reassess its AA (stable) rating at the end of next month. A survey on Friday showed the recovery in French business activity eased more than expected in June, but companies took on workers at the fastest pace in nearly 10 years. Moody's is also due to review its Aaa rating for Germany and its Caa3 rating for Greece on Friday. Analysts at DZ Bank are calling for an upgrade to Caa2 for Greece after the country secured a debt deal with creditors earlier this month.

Former Indian naval officer Kulbhushan Jadhav was arrested last year in Pakistan's southwestern province of Baluchistan, the site of a long-running conflict between the Pakistan military and separatist insurgents.  Commander Jadhav has admitted his involvement in espionage, terrorist and subversive activities in Pakistan and expressed remorse at the resultant loss of any precious lives and extensive damage to property due to his actions,  Pakistan's military said in a statement, adding that he had asked for mercy on  compassionate grounds . India dismissed the Pakistan military's statement as an attempt to influence the proceedings of the World Court where India has sought justice for Jadhav.  It renewed its demand for consular access to Jadhav and the grant of visas to his family to meet him in prison.  The details and circumstances of the alleged mercy petition by Mr Jadhav are not clear and even the fact of its existence is doubtful, shrouded as the proceedings against Mr Jadhav have been in opacity,  the Indian Foreign Ministry said in a statement. Ties between the nuclear-armed bitter foes remain difficult and on Thursday there was fresh fighting on the disputed border in Kashmir, at the heart of 70 years of animosity. Armed intruders from Pakistan crossed the Line of Control or  the de facto border separating Kashmir between the two countries and killed two Indian soldiers, the Indian military said on Friday. Fighting on the border has flared through the summer and the Indian army has vowed firm action to avenge the losses. After Jadhav was sentenced to death in April, India asked the World Court for an injunction to bar the execution, arguing that he was denied diplomatic assistance during what it terms as an unfair trial.  The World Court ordered Pakistan in May to delay Jadhav's execution. It argued that Islamabad violated a treaty guaranteeing diplomatic assistance to foreigners accused of crimes.  Pakistan authorities say Jadhav confessed to being assigned by India's intelligence service to organize espionage and sabotage in Baluchistan  aiming to destabilize and wage war against Pakistan . Baluchistan is at the center of a $57 billion Chinese-backed  Belt and Road  development project that first focused on Chinese firms building roads and power stations but is now expanding to include setting up industries. In a transcript released by Pakistan, Jadhav says disrupting the Chinese-funded projects was a main goal of his activities.

Crude oil pulled away from this week's 10-month lows, although prices were still set for their worst first-half performance since 1997. The slide in energy prices worsens the outlook for inflation creating a headache for the world's major central banks looking to normalize rates after years of ultra-loose policy.  (The) oil price is the 'poster child' for victory of deflation,  analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch said in a note of weekly investment flows. Investors were beginning to shift allocations accordingly and moving out of assets typically in favour when prices are rising such as inflation-protected U.S. Treasury funds and bank loans. Elsewhere inflows into equities slowed with some investors moving into laggard energy shares. European shares fell 0.2 percent while MSCI's gauge of world stocks rose 0.1 percent. In currency markets, the bounce in oil helped commodity currencies such as the Canadian dollar. The dollar weakened against a basket of major currencies and is now down more than 0.5 percent since this week's earlier highs as doubts about how quickly the Fed will be able to raise rates crept in.  Inflation is likely to be the theme that moves currencies next week which will see the release of various U.S. indicators. They will be key as this week's slump in crude oil has clouded the U.S. inflation outlook,  said Shin Kadota, a senior strategist at Barclays in Tokyo. In Britain, on the one-year anniversary of last year's shock Brexit referendum in which Britons voted to leave the EU, sterling extended gains. The pound rose 0.37 percent against the dollar following more comments from Bank of England policymakers calling for a rate hike.

The affirmation follows the addition of Boursorama Banque S.A. (Boursorama) as collateral provider under the programme, which took effect via a secured loan as per the provisions of article L-211-38 of the French Monetary and Financial Code. This collateral backs advances made by SG SFH to Societe Generale S.A. (SG), which then on-lends the proceeds to Boursorama. The new collateral represents about 6% of the cover pool and lead to a EUR2 billion OFH issuance. KEY RATING DRIVERS The OFH are rated 'AAA', above SG's Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of 'A', which acts as the reference IDR for this programme. This rating is based on an IDR uplift of two notches, a payment continuity uplift (PCU) of four notches, a recovery uplift of two notches and the programme's 8.5% over-collateralisation (OC), which is the OC used for the purpose of the asset coverage test (ACT), which provides more protection than Fitch's 6.5% 'AAA' breakeven OC. The Stable Outlook on the OFH reflects the significant buffer against a downgrade of SG's IDR due to the different uplift factors above the reference IDR and the available OC. IDR Uplift The programme's IDR uplift remains unchanged at two notches. This uplift relies on OFH's exemption from bail-in, Fitch's assessment that resolution of the issuer banking group will not result in the direct enforcement of recourse against the cover pool, and the low risk of under-collateralisation for OFH at the point of resolution, in Fitch's view (see Fitch's Jurisdictional Analysis of the Risk of Undercollateralisation of Covered Bonds - Excel file), and that SG's IDR is driven by the bank's 'a' Viability Rating. PCU Fitch has maintained the PCU of four notches based on the OFH principal and interest protection provided by a nine months pre-maturity reserve. Fitch has applied the PCU corresponding to weakest liquidity protection, as soft bullet issues, with a 12-month maturity extension, represent about 74% of the total outstanding covered bonds. Recovery Uplift The programme benefits from a two-notch recovery uplift, as the OC which Fitch relies upon in its analysis can cover credit losses in an 'AAA' rating scenario. Breakeven Asset Percentage Fitch's 'AAA' breakeven OC remains at 6.5%, driven by the 'AAA' credit loss. The credit loss has remained at roughly the same level given that there were no significant changes to the cover pool characteristics. The breakeven OC is based on the combination of a 'AA' probability of default basis and a two-notch uplift for recoveries given default. RATING SENSITIVITIES The 'AAA' rating of Societe Generale SFH's Obligations de Financement de l'Habitat would be vulnerable to a downgrade if any of the following occurs: (i) the bank's Long-Term Issuer Default Rating is downgraded by four notches to 'BBB-' or below; (ii) the relied upon over-collateralisation (OC), which is the contractual OC, decreases below Fitch's 'AAA' breakeven OC of 6.5%.

The ECB estimates that 101 billion euros worth of euro-denominated derivatives trading is cleared in the UK each day and open positions total around 33 trillion euros, or more than 90 percent of all euro derivatives trade done around the globe.      The ECB is concerned that its authority over the trading may be weakened after Brexit, undercutting the central bank's oversight of a systematically important activity. ECB board member Benoit Coeure said this week clearing activities might need to be moved from London to the EU if the post-Brexit framework reduces the ECB's powers.  Its authority is now primarily exercised through its participation in supervisory colleges - panel that includes host country and international supervisors - and backed by European court jurisdiction. The new powers, subject to the European Parliament's approval, would give the ECB more powers in recognizing and supervising systemically important clearing houses outside the EU if they handle  significant amounts  of euro-denominated transactions, the ECB said in a statement.  The amendments will allow the Eurosystem to monitor and address risks associated with central clearing activities that could affect the conduct of monetary policy, the operation of payment systems and the stability of the euro,  the ECB said. The proposed amendment is part of the EU's review of its European Market infrastructure regulation and the EU Commission's efforts to increase its powers over clearing.  New rules now under consideration in Brussels would give the EU powers to forcibly move clearing to the bloc if enhanced supervision is deemed insufficient.

Risk aversion is on the rise, mainly due to what's happening in the Middle East and also the news about China cracking down on some loans made overseas last year,  said Richard Xu, a fund manager at China's biggest gold exchange-traded fund, HuaAn Gold.                  China's banking regulator has ordered a group of lenders to assess their exposure to offshore acquisitions by a handful of companies that have been on an overseas buying spree, two people familiar with the matter said on Thursday.                  Spot gold        was up 0.3 percent at $1,254.11 per ounce, as of 0751 GMT, but was nearly flat for the week.     U.S. gold futures         for August delivery climbed 0.5 percent to $1,255.10 per ounce.     The political situation in the United States, the UK, and North Korea-related developments are among the other factors creating a safe-haven demand for gold, said Brian Lan, managing director at gold dealer GoldSilver Central in Singapore.     Tensions rose as North Korea carried out another test of a rocket engine that the United States believes could be part of its programme to develop an intercontinental ballistic missile, a U.S. official told Reuters on Thursday.                  Gold is used as an alternative investment during situations of political and financial uncertainty.     Investors will keep an eye on key U.S. economic data due next week for cues on the U.S. Federal Reserve's rate hike decision.              U.S. data due next week include the June consumer confidence indicator, pending home sales, crude oil inventories, revised first quarter GDP and the PCE price index.                   The Fed has mentioned it will most likely raise rates one more time. The data will be important to know whether it is a favorable time for the central bank to raise rates,  Lan added.      Spot gold        may retest a resistance at $1,254 per ounce, with a good chance of breaking above this level and rising more towards the next resistance at $1,262, according to Reuters technical analyst Wang Tao.                  The dollar was down 0.2 percent against a basket of currencies, drifting away from the near one-month peak of 111.790 hit on Tuesday.            Among other precious metals, silver        gained 1.1 percent to $16.72 per ounce. It was up 0.8 percent for the week.     Platinum        climbed 0.6 percent to $926.45 per ounce. It was up 0.5 percent this week.     Palladium        rose 0.9 percent to $891.60 per ounce, and was up 3.5 percent this week.

According to the people, Mega Pharma would first issue a bond as early as this year. Tapping global debt markets first would speed up a plan by Germany's Struengmann family to market a future initial public offering globally, the people said.  Mega Pharma, which is based in an industrial park in the Uruguayan city of Canelones, is controlled by twin brothers Andreas and Thomas Struengmann - also the founders of generic drugmaker Hexal AG that was sold to Novartis AG (NOVN.S) 12 years ago and a fixture in recent biotech investment rounds. Both the Struengmanns and Mega Pharma, which has $1 billion in annual revenue and 10 factories across Latin America, considered listing the stock in the United States and either Colombia, Brazil or Argentina, the people said. Jefferies declined to comment. The Struengmanns and Mega Pharma did not respond to requests for comment. The people spoke under the condition of anonymity to discuss the plans freely. Their quest for investor money underscores how pharmaceutical deals could gain further steam in a region where demand for medicines has spiked in recent years. Some biotech investors globally are also burning through cash faster than ever before, as they try to turn their companies into specialty pharmaceutical firms. In the 12 months through June 22, there were 21 pharmaceutical-related mergers and acquisitions in Latin America, compared with only five in the same period a decade ago, according to Thomson Reuters data. Based on the value of recent pharmaceutical deals in Latin America, Mega Pharma could be worth about $2.5 billion, private equity bankers told Reuters. Mega Pharma's focus on branded medicines has shielded it from heightened competition in generic drugs, a segment that has seen declining returns in recent years, the same bankers said. The Struengmanns joined Mega Pharma when Argentina's Laboratorios Roemmers SA decided to form a unit grouping some local assets in Argentina with others in Uruguay, Mexico, Dominican Republic, Ecuador and Venezuela. A year ago, Mega Pharma opened Mega Labs, a $110 million compound in Uruguay that is so far its largest. They own stakes in German biotech firms Glycotope and BioNTech. Along with buyout investors, three years ago they purchased a hearing aid devices producer from Siemens AG (SIEGn.DE). Since selling Hexal, the Struengmanns have invested in banking too.  A month ago, the brothers agreed to sell their German regional lender Suedwestbank AG, their main investment in banking and which they bought in 2004, to a Cerberus Capital Management LP-led bank from Austria.

The ECB estimates that 101 billion euros worth of euro-denominated derivatives trading is cleared in the UK each day and open positions total around 33 trillion euros, or more than 90 percent of all euro derivatives trade done around the globe.      The ECB is concerned that its authority over the trading may be weakened after Brexit, undercutting the central bank's oversight of a systematically important activity. ECB board member Benoit Coeure said this week clearing activities might need to be moved from London to the EU if the post-Brexit framework reduces the ECB's powers.  Its authority is now primarily exercised through its participation in supervisory colleges - panel that includes host country and international supervisors - and backed by European court jurisdiction. The new powers, subject to the European Parliament's approval, would give the ECB more powers in recognizing and supervising systemically important clearing houses outside the EU if they handle  significant amounts  of euro-denominated transactions, the ECB said in a statement.  The amendments will allow the Eurosystem to monitor and address risks associated with central clearing activities that could affect the conduct of monetary policy, the operation of payment systems and the stability of the euro,  the ECB said. The proposed amendment is part of the EU's review of its European Market infrastructure regulation and the EU Commission's efforts to increase its powers over clearing.  New rules now under consideration in Brussels would give the EU powers to forcibly move clearing to the bloc if enhanced supervision is deemed insufficient.

Up to 20,000 English, Scottish, Welsh and Irish fans are expected to visit New Zealand during the Lions tour and on Friday they were packing city centre bars on the eve of the first of three tests against the All Blacks.  It's getting real now,  said Lions scrumhalf Conor Murray.  Over the last week you can see the numbers arriving and the buzz is definitely there and it feels proper now.  There'd be something wrong with you if you didn't enjoy this.  The demographic is predominantly male and 40 plus, with faces that sometimes show the scars of the rugby battles of their own youth and mostly clothed in at least one piece of Lions merchandise. Derek Carnegie, a Scot who now lives in Newbury in England, is fulfilling a lifetime ambition by travelling to New Zealand to watch the three tests against the world champions.  I've always wanted to go on a Lions tour and the All Blacks is the epitome of the Lions,  he said, clad in a red Lions shirt and enjoying an early evening beer at an Irish-themed pub.  I'm 68 now and I'll probably not be able to do it when they next tour New Zealand in 2029 so I thought, this was my chance.  The mood in the pubs and bars where the Lions fans congregate can be drunken but is almost always good-natured with banter rather than punches exchanged with local rugby fans. Lions tour manager John Spencer was involved in an incident on Wednesday where he was shoved by a local while dining at an Auckland restaurant but assistant coach Rob Howley was keen to emphasise that it was very much the exception.  I spoke to John. It's an isolated incident, a disappointing incident,  the Welshman told reporters on Friday.  Since we've been here in New Zealand we've had a fantastic welcome. The New Zealand public have been unbelievable in their hospitality wherever we've been. Unfortunately, in sport there's always a minority.  Prices for organised tours ranged up to $15,000 for a 40-day tour stay with flights, accommodation and tickets to all 10 matches but most have managed to do it for less by limiting their stay and being selective about the games they see. Some, like Welshman Brian Davies, travelled without match tickets at all, making the trip just to be in Auckland, where two of the three test matches take place, and soak up the atmosphere of the  ultimate rugby tour . In his case a chance meeting on an Auckland street with a ticket  tout , or scalper, he knows from back home in Cardiff means he will now be among the 50,000 crowd at Eden Park on Saturday. The Lions tour New Zealand every 12 years and won just one series in 1971 but success on the pitch is not necessarily the point for the soldiers in the Red Army.  I don't care,  added Carnegie.  I reckon that being in the stadium and being part of a Lions tour is enough. Even if we lose 80-0, it's all about the sport, it's all about the buzz.

Facebook, which outlined new efforts to remove extremist and terrorism content from its social media platform last week, will launch the Online Civil Courage Initiative in the UK on Friday, the company said in a statement. The new initiative will train non-governmental organizations to help them monitor and respond to extremist content and create a dedicated support desk so they can communicate directly with Facebook, the company said.   There is no place for hate or violence on Facebook,  said Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook's chief operating officer.  We use technology like AI to find and remove terrorist propaganda, and we have teams of counterterrorism experts and reviewers around the world working to keep extremist content off our platform.   The British government has stepped up attacks on Silicon Valley internet companies for not acting quickly enough to take down extremist online propaganda and fostering  safe places  where extremists can breed following a string of attacks in recent months in London and Manchester. Facebook, Alphabet Inc's Google and Twitter Inc have responded by saying they have made heavy investments and employed thousands of people to take down hate speech and violent content over the past two years. Security analysts say the efforts have dramatically reduced the use of these platforms for jihadist recruitment efforts, although more work needs to be done. Prime Minister Theresa May has sought to enlist British public opinion to force the U.S. internet players to work more closely with the government rather than proposing new legislation or policies to assert greater control over the web. Earlier this week, May urged fellow European Union leaders at a meeting in Brussels to join her in putting pressure on tech companies to 'rid terrorist material from the internet in all our languages'.  She called for the internet companies to shift from reactively removing content when they are notified of it, toward greater use of automatic detection and removal tools - and ultimately preventing it from appearing on their platforms in the first place.

The 74,000-tonne LNG cargo was loaded from Cheniere's Sabine Pass export terminal in Louisiana and is scheduled to arrive at the port of Tongyeong, South Korea on July 2, one of the sources said. Both sources declined to be identified. The 20-year supply deal, under which KOGAS will receive 2.8 million tonnes of the supercooled fuel per year from Cheniere, had long been expected to kick in this year, but its exact start time was not known in markets. The commencement of the deal could weigh on spot LNG demand in Asia as it means KOGAS will likely have less appetite for spot supplies, said a Singapore-based LNG trader. South Korea, the world's No.2 LNG importer, mostly ships in the commodity through state-run KOGAS. The company imports about 30 million tonnes of LNG per year, mainly from Qatar. The SM Eagle, the vessel carrying the first Cheniere cargo, is currently en route in the Pacific Ocean after sailing through the Panama Canal following loading on June 2, according to shipping data in Thomson Reuters Eikon. In January, South Korean gas and power company SK E&S; took delivery of the country's first spot cargo of shale gas imported from the Sabine Pass LNG terminal.

Traders were looking to U.S. inflation data due next week to provide clues on the U.S. Federal Reserve's likely interest rate policy. The dollar index - which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, the euro the heaviest weighted among them - inched down by a quarter of a percent as the euro hit $1.1180, its highest since Monday. The European Central Bank is deciding when and how quickly to wind back its expansive quantitative easing (QE) programme.  With the debate over ECB QE policy heating up, expect the euro to be much more sensitive to data surprises,  wrote ING currency strategist Viraj Patel in a research note. UBS currency strategist Daniel Trum, however, in Zurich, said currency markets were not showing great sensitivity to data at the the moment unless they were particularly weak or strong. He said the euro had been lifted this week by consumer confidence hitting a 16-year high in June. The dollar peaked at a one-month high on Tuesday after the Federal Reserve hiked interest rates last week and left the door open for further monetary tightening later in the year. But it has been stuck in a tight range since, awaiting fresh catalysts.  For the dollar we’re in a waiting game until September,  said Trum.  In our view they’ll then hike interest rates but then start to talk about the inflation rate - if that doesn't start to go up then future hikes will become more difficult.  U.S. data due next week include the June consumer confidence indicator, pending home sales, crude oil inventories, revised first quarter GDP and the PCE price index.  While most U.S. indicators bear watching, what really matters for the dollar are wages and inflation-related data, culminating with the non-farm payrolls in two week's time,  said Makoto Noji, a senior strategist at SMBC Nikko Securities. Commodity-linked currencies held to significant gains made on Thursday following a rebound in crude oil prices from 10-month lows. The Canadian dollar was flat at C$1.3223 per U.S. dollar after rallying 0.75 percent on Thursday. Exactly a year after Britain voted to leave the European Union, sterling was almost half a percent stronger on the day at $1.2738, with some investors betting the Bank of England could raise interest rates as soon as August. In the year since the vote, the pound has fallen more than 15 percent against the dollar and almost 13 percent versus the euro.

Facebook, which outlined new efforts to remove extremist and terrorism content from its social media platform last week, will launch the Online Civil Courage Initiative in the UK on Friday, the company said in a statement. The new initiative will train non-governmental organizations to help them monitor and respond to extremist content and create a dedicated support desk so they can communicate directly with Facebook, the company said.   There is no place for hate or violence on Facebook,  said Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook's chief operating officer.  We use technology like AI to find and remove terrorist propaganda, and we have teams of counterterrorism experts and reviewers around the world working to keep extremist content off our platform.   The British government has stepped up attacks on Silicon Valley internet companies for not acting quickly enough to take down extremist online propaganda and fostering  safe places  where extremists can breed following a string of attacks in recent months in London and Manchester. Facebook, Alphabet Inc's Google and Twitter Inc have responded by saying they have made heavy investments and employed thousands of people to take down hate speech and violent content over the past two years. Security analysts say the efforts have dramatically reduced the use of these platforms for jihadist recruitment efforts, although more work needs to be done. Prime Minister Theresa May has sought to enlist British public opinion to force the U.S. internet players to work more closely with the government rather than proposing new legislation or policies to assert greater control over the web. Earlier this week, May urged fellow European Union leaders at a meeting in Brussels to join her in putting pressure on tech companies to 'rid terrorist material from the internet in all our languages'.  She called for the internet companies to shift from reactively removing content when they are notified of it, toward greater use of automatic detection and removal tools - and ultimately preventing it from appearing on their platforms in the first place.

The world's top sugar importer brought in 186,765 tonnes of sugar in May, up 38 percent from a year earlier, customs data showed on Friday. Some analysts said they had expected a smaller tonnage, between 100,000 and 150,000 tonnes, as refineries were waiting to receive new import permits. China in late May imposed hefty tariffs on out-of-quota sugar imports, making it much more expensive to bring in sugar from major producers, Thailand and Brazil, after lobbying by domestic sugar mills. It also slashed permits for those imports to almost half of last year's allowance. Imports were down slightly from the previous month's 190,000 tonnes, according to data released by the General Administration of Customs. Arrivals are usually higher during the peak summer months and analysts said the total was still fairly low.  The sugar refineries have used up their quota so far and haven't got new quota,  said Zhan Xiao, an analyst at Shanghai Buyun Investment Management. Imports in the first five months of the year rose to 1.27 million tonnes, up 32 percent from the same period in 2016, boosted by low global prices.

The USDA had  recurring concerns about the safety of the products intended for the American market,  after increasing tests on Brazilian beef in March, according to a statement. The agency raised scrutiny on Brazilian beef and ready-to-eat products as a precaution following an investigation into corruption involving Brazil's health inspectors that targeted meat companies JBS SA (JBSS3.SA) and BRF SA (BRFS3.SA). JBS, the world's largest meat packer, declined to comment on the U.S. ban. The USDA's action threatens the reputation of meat from Brazil, the world's top exporter of beef and poultry, even though the United States is not a top customer. It also could boost domestic sales in the United States.  Product was already on the water and that's not going to be allowed in,  Altin Kalo, a U.S. livestock analyst at Steiner Consulting Group, said about shipments headed to the United States from Brazil via boat. Since March, the USDA has rejected 11 percent of Brazilian fresh beef products, compared to the rejection rate of 1 percent for shipments from the rest of the world, the agency said. The shipments, totaling about 1.9 million pounds, raised concerns about public health, animal health and sanitation, according to the USDA.  The agency said none of the rejected lots made it into the U.S. market. Cattle walk on a tract of Amazon rainforest that has been cleared by loggers and farmers near the city of Novo Progresso, Para State, Brazil, July 2, 2013.Nacho DoceThe move to block Brazilian meat is a turnaround for Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, who warned in March that Brazil might retaliate if the United States halted beef imports. On Thursday, he said in a statement that  although international trade is an important part of what we do at USDA, and Brazil has long been one of our partners, my first priority is to protect American consumers.  A customer (R) pays for his meat at the Municipal Market in Sao Paulo October 10, 2014.Nacho DoceThe U.S. suspension will remain in place until Brazil's Agriculture Ministry  takes corrective action which the USDA finds satisfactory,  according to the agency. A slew of global buyers, including China, Egypt and Chile, curtailed imports of Brazilian meat after Brazilian federal police unveiled an investigation into alleged corruption in the sector on March 17. Brazilian authorities said at the time that meat companies made payments to government health officials to forego inspections and cover up health violations. China is not expected to follow the U.S. move as it only permits imports of frozen Brazilian beef, which has different requirements to fresh meat, said analysts. Brazil is also China's top beef supplier, and would be difficult to replace in the short-term, said Pan Chenjun, senior animal protein analyst at Rabobank. The United States began allowing shipments of fresh beef from Brazil last year after banning them due to concerns about foot and mouth disease in cattle.

I find myself surrounded by refugees, and I feel we are being valued - I love the initiative,  Marie, a refugee from the Democratic Republic of Congo, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in her native French.  Marie and Reem, a 28-year-old from Syria, are among some 50 refugee women who have trained as florists in the British capital in a bid to overcome the many challenges they face on their way to meaningful employment.  While most are still waiting for their asylum applications to be processed, some of the women are now working as nursery teachers, elderly carers or volunteering in shops. The women interviewed in the workshop declined to reveal their real names to avoid repercussions back home.  The training aims to give them a grounding in their adopted homeland, as well as teaching the artistry of flower arranging.

During workshops, they practice speaking English and make new friends in the capital. There were about 117,000 refugees and 35,000 asylum seekers in Britain in June 2016, according to the United Nations.  Even if migrants are granted refugee status in Britain and given access to regular benefits and the right to work, limited job opportunities and growing anti-immigration sentiment mean they are not always able to find work. For women, the path to employment is paved with further obstacles: many lack the skills or confidence of their male peers, while others struggle to find jobs that would cover the high cost of childcare. Reem used to teach in Syria but could not find education or work opportunities in London that would take into account her two children - until she started training with Bread and Roses. She can now bring them along while she gains workplace experience and achieves a level of English that will allow her to train to become a nurse - her ultimate goal.  Because of childcare and health issues, it's very difficult for even part-time work - 15 to 20 hours a week is quite a big ask,  said Sneh Jani, co-founder of Bread and Roses. Breaking Barriers Many refugee women come from countries such as Syria, Eritrea and the Democratic Republic of Congo, where education and work opportunities are more limited for women than for men.  They are less skilled and haven't had the career or employment history that their male counterparts have,  Matthew Powell, director of employment charity Breaking Barriers, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone.  They have transferable skills that they can apply but don't know how to articulate them,  he added. For example, women might have cared for elderly relatives back home, but do not recognize this experience as relevant to a next step in healthcare, Powell said. The Middle East and North Africa have the lowest rates of women in paid work and most jobs were confined to education, social work and agriculture, a United Nations report said last week. Flower Power Some of the obstacles the women face lie deep within: the emotional and physical scars left by the violence they fled at home, which can prevent them taking on full-time work. Many women attending the Hackney workshops were survivors of female genital mutilation, sexual abuse or trafficking.   Refugees often have to overcome the mental scars of torture or persecution, of losing loved ones, or of arduous journeys,  said Laura Padoan, a spokeswoman for the U.N. refugee agency UNHCR.  Refugee women in particular are more vulnerable to exploitation, trafficking and abuse at every stage of their journeys.  Baggage and Skills Without a job, migrants can't earn an income, improve their English or meet people - key factors for integration. And migrant women often face a disproportionate degree of isolation.   Women don't get access to the same social networks that men do, within or outside their ethnic community,  Powell said.  They're not getting this moral support, not able to chat with friends,  he added. Back in the workshop, Marie sweeps up the last petals and stalks while Reem feeds her 9-month-old son, who falls silent.  Refugees are people we should not underestimate,  Marie said.  They might have emotional baggage because they have been through bad things, but they have a lot of skills.  Reporting by Anna Pujol-Mazzini @annapmzn, Editing by Lyndsay Griffiths.

The USDA had  recurring concerns about the safety of the products intended for the American market,  after increasing tests on Brazilian beef in March, according to a statement. The agency raised scrutiny on Brazilian beef and ready-to-eat products as a precaution following an investigation into corruption involving Brazil's health inspectors that targeted meat companies JBS SA (JBSS3.SA) and BRF SA (BRFS3.SA). JBS, the world's largest meat packer, declined to comment on the U.S. ban. The USDA's action threatens the reputation of meat from Brazil, the world's top exporter of beef and poultry, even though the United States is not a top customer. It also could boost domestic sales in the United States.  Product was already on the water and that's not going to be allowed in,  Altin Kalo, a U.S. livestock analyst at Steiner Consulting Group, said about shipments headed to the United States from Brazil via boat. Since March, the USDA has rejected 11 percent of Brazilian fresh beef products, compared to the rejection rate of 1 percent for shipments from the rest of the world, the agency said. The shipments, totaling about 1.9 million pounds, raised concerns about public health, animal health and sanitation, according to the USDA.  The agency said none of the rejected lots made it into the U.S. market. Cattle walk on a tract of Amazon rainforest that has been cleared by loggers and farmers near the city of Novo Progresso, Para State, Brazil, July 2, 2013.Nacho DoceThe move to block Brazilian meat is a turnaround for Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, who warned in March that Brazil might retaliate if the United States halted beef imports. On Thursday, he said in a statement that  although international trade is an important part of what we do at USDA, and Brazil has long been one of our partners, my first priority is to protect American consumers.  A customer (R) pays for his meat at the Municipal Market in Sao Paulo October 10, 2014.Nacho DoceThe U.S. suspension will remain in place until Brazil's Agriculture Ministry  takes corrective action which the USDA finds satisfactory,  according to the agency. A slew of global buyers, including China, Egypt and Chile, curtailed imports of Brazilian meat after Brazilian federal police unveiled an investigation into alleged corruption in the sector on March 17. Brazilian authorities said at the time that meat companies made payments to government health officials to forego inspections and cover up health violations. China is not expected to follow the U.S. move as it only permits imports of frozen Brazilian beef, which has different requirements to fresh meat, said analysts. Brazil is also China's top beef supplier, and would be difficult to replace in the short-term, said Pan Chenjun, senior animal protein analyst at Rabobank. The United States began allowing shipments of fresh beef from Brazil last year after banning them due to concerns about foot and mouth disease in cattle.

The Nikkei closed at 20,132.67, up 0.1 percent on the day. The index gained 1.0 percent for the week, its first weekly gains in three weeks after having touched its highest levels since August 2015 on Tuesday, supported by a fall in the yen and optimism over the global economy. Exporters were mixed as the dollar steadied against the yen at 111.28, failing to provide catalysts. Toyota Motor Corp dropped 0.3 percent, Honda Motor Co rose 0.5 percent and Tokyo Electron Ltd shed 1.0 percent. With monetary decisions by the U.S. Federal Reserve and the Bank Of Japan out of the way, investors were hard pressed to find fresh catalysts, traders said.  It's like the market has started its summer holiday early,  said Hiroyuki Nakai, chief strategist at Tokai Tokyo Research Center.  Even after the Fed raised interest rates, the dollar didn't strengthen against the yen, so investors are finding it hard to chase Japanese stocks higher.  Nakai said retail investors were seen buying certain stocks such as Nintendo Co, which surged 2.8 percent to its highest since 2008. The stock has stayed strong since it announced last week on Twitter that it would release Super Mario Odyssey for Switch on Oct. 27. Underperforming the market were mobile phone carriers following an NHK report. The national broadcaster reported the communication ministry would conduct 'administrative guidance' to urge firms to improve explanations of their phone plans to customers before customers sign up for contracts.

A Reuters poll of 16 economists found the Bank of Japan's quarterly tankan business sentiment survey is expected to show the headline index for big manufacturers' sentiment rising 3 points to plus 15 in June from three months ago.  That would be the third straight quarterly rises, matching the level seen in the June 2015 survey and highest since March 2014 when the index stood at plus 17.  We expect big manufacturers' mood is recovering due to a favorable export environment, stable currency and factory output  recovering on a pickup in consumer spending,  said Tsuyoshi Ueno, senior economist at NLI Research Institute.  As for the outlook, in addition to uncertainty over the Trump administration, geopolitical issues such as Brexit and the North Korea situation will weigh on business sentiment.  The poll found the big non-manufacturers' sentiment index would rise 3 points to plus 23 in June, which would be the highest level since December 2015 when the index was at plus 25.  Business confidence among big manufacturers was seen likely worsen slightly to plus 14 in the coming quarter, while non-manufacturers' morale is seen deteriorating to plus 20, the poll found. The survey found that big firms will plan to raise their capital spending in this fiscal year by 7.4 percent, upgrading from 0.6 percent in the March survey.   The BOJ will announce the outcome of its quarterly tankan  survey at 8:50 a.m. on July 3 (2350 GMT on July 2). The Reuters monthly Tankan, which tracks the BOJ's survey, showed confidence among Japanese manufacturers bounced in June to match a decade-high level recorded in April and is expected to rise for several months, providing more evidence of economic recovery. The poll also found the core consumer price index (CPI), which includes oil products but excludes volatile fresh food prices, was expected to rise 0.4 percent in May, up for a fifth straight month, driven by energy costs. Factory output was thought likely to fall 3.2 percent in May from the previous month, but analysts believe that such a drop would be in reaction to a 4.0 percent gain in April. Retail sales were forecast to rise an annual 2.6 percent in  May, up for a seventh straight month. The poll showed household spending likely slipped 0.6 percent from a year earlier, down for 15 straight months, although the rate of decline slowed from a 1.4 percent drop in April.  Consumer spending on durable goods such as autos and electrical appliances is on the rise but wage recovery remains sluggish, so the pace of recovery in consumer spending will stay slow,  said Takumi Tsunoda, senior economist at Shinkin Central Bank Research Institute. The jobs-to-applicants ratio was seen steady at 1.48 in May, staying at the highest level since February 1974 when the ratio was at 1.53. And the unemployment rate likely stood at 2.8 percent for the month, unchanged form the previous month. The internal affairs ministry will release core CPI, household spending and jobs-related data at 8:30 a.m. on Friday (23:30 GMT on Thursday). The trade ministry will announce retail sales at 8:50 a.m. on Thursday and industrial production on Friday. Japan's government on Thursday raised its overall view of the economy for the first time in six months, reflecting a gradual pick-up in private consumption and underscoring its confidence that an export-led recovery is broadening.

Markit's flash composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors that account for more than two-thirds of the economy, fell to a four-month low of 56.1 from 57.4 in May. The reading undershot the consensus forecast in a Reuters poll of economists but remained well above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction. Markit said that despite the fall, the reading still pointed to a strong growth in Europe's largest economy.

He added:  The average reading for the second quarter, at 56.7, was the highest since the second quarter of 2011.  Activity in the manufacturing sector slowed slightly, with the index falling to 59.3 from 59.5 a month earlier. The services sector index fell to 53.7 from 55.4 in May. Strong demand from Europe, America and Asia translated into growth in new orders for the sixth time in seven months. New orders grew at the fastest pace since March 2011.  The latest data signaled a growing performance gap between manufacturing and services,  said Balchin.  The goods-producing sector continued to outperform, with the headline PMI little-changed from May's 73-month record,  he said.  Although growth of manufacturing output, exports and jobs all eased slightly since May, expansions in backlogs and total new orders gathered pace and supply bottlenecks intensified.  Markit's figures chime with data pointing to accelerated growth in Germany this year. The Ifo economic institute this week lifted it growth forecast to 1.8 percent from 1.5 percent, citing vibrant domestic demand and strong export growth fueled by a recovery in the euro zone. Markit expects the economy to expand by 2 percent this year, which would be the highest rate since 2011.

The United States assessed that the test, the latest in a series of engine and missile trials this year, could be for the smallest stage of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) rocket engine, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. A second U.S. official also confirmed the test but did not provide additional details on the type of rocket component that was being tested or whether it fit into the ICBM program. One official said he believed the test had taken place within the past 24 hours. North Korea's state media, which is normally quick to publicize successful missile-related developments, did not carry any reports on the engine test. South Korean officials did not have details about the reported test and declined to comment on the possible nature of the engine. South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who was elected last month on a platform of a more moderate approach to Pyongyang including dialogue to ease tension, inspected the test-launch of a ballistic missile on Friday that is being developed by the South's military.  I believe in dialogue, but dialogue is possible when it's backed by strong defense and engagement policy is possible only when we have security ability that can overwhelm the North,  Moon was quoted by his office as saying at the test site. Moon's office did not disclose the details of the missile being tested, but South Korea has been working to develop ballistic missiles with a range of 800 km (500 miles), a voluntary cap under an agreement with the United States. The United States has tried for years to discourage South Korea from developing longer-range ballistic missiles in keeping with the Missile Technology Control Regime, a voluntary international arms-control pact. China Pressed to Exert Pressure The disclosure of the North's engine test came a day after the United States pressed China to exert more economic and diplomatic pressure on North Korea to help rein in its nuclear and missile programs during a round of high-level talks in Washington. Moon told Reuters in an exclusive interview on Thursday that strong new sanctions would be needed if the North conducted a new nuclear test or an intercontinental ballistic missile test and that he planned to call on Chinese President Xi Jinping to play a greater role in reining in Pyongyang's arms program. U.S. President Donald Trump has warned that a  major, major conflict  with North Korea is possible over its weapons programs, although U.S. officials say tougher sanctions, not military force, are the preferred option. China's top diplomat, Yang Jiechi, told Trump in a meeting at the White House that Beijing was willing to  maintain communication and coordination  with the United States in an effort to defuse tension on the Korean peninsula, according to a statement from China's Foreign Ministry on Friday. The head of the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency told Congress last month that North Korea, if left unchecked, was on an  inevitable  path to obtaining a nuclear-armed missile capable of striking the U.S. mainland. However, experts say Pyongyang could still be years away from have a reliable ICBM capability. The continental United States is around 5,600 miles (9,000 km) from North Korea. ICBMs have a minimum range of about 3,400 miles (5,500 km), but some are designed to travel 6,200 miles (10,000 km) or farther. Any military solution to the North Korea crisis would be  tragic on an unbelievable scale , Trump's defense secretary, Jim Mattis, said last month. The United States, meanwhile, is ramping up capabilities to defend against the threat from North Korea, staging its first-ever successful test to intercept an incoming ICBM-type missile in May. But a test on June 21 of a new capability being developed by the United States and Japan to defend against shorter-range missiles failed to hit its target, the U.S. Missile Defense Agency said on Thursday. It was the second such test of the SM-3 Block IIA interceptor, which is being developed by Raytheon. The previous intercept test, conducted in February, had been successful.

A full list of the rating actions is provided at the end of this commentary. The Outlook revision reflects the significant improvement in the company's presales, which may result in higher EBITDA recognition, and the subsequent reduction in the risk of the company breaching its local-currency debt covenants in 2017. In 1Q17, Modernland booked presales of over IDR600 billion, more than three times the 1Q16 presales of around IDR200 billion. In Fitch's view, the company's strategy of selling land in bulk has been successful in managing its liquidity during the challenging property market and reinforces its track record in such sales. KEY RATING DRIVERS Improving Demand: Fitch forecasts Modernland to book IDR2 trillion-2.5 trillion of attributable presales in 2017, as the company launches new residential clusters in its Jakarta Garden City (JGC) project, and demand for residential and industrial properties improves. Fitch expects this growth to translate into higher EBITDA recognition, which materially reduces the risk of Modernland breaching its local-currency debt covenants. Bulk Land Sales Support Liquidity: Fitch believes Modernland's large land bank and the good locations of the sites allow the company to sell land in bulk, which may provide liquidity support during downturns in the property cycle. In 2013-2016, Modernland sold over 200 hectares of land to Charoen Pokphand (CP), 8.5 hectares to AEON, 0.5 hectares to Cross Mobile, 3.7 hectares to IKEA, and 120 hectares to PT Alam Sutera Realty Tbk (ASRI; B+/Negative). In 4Q16, the company sold around 67 hectares to its 50:50 joint venture with PT Astra Land Indonesia. Volatile Cashflows, Low Development Risk: Modernland's exposure to bulk land sales and industrial land sales results in more volatile cash flows than peers that depend on residential sales. Nevertheless, the land sales remain important contributors to Modernland's cash flows, and the volatility is mitigated by the low development risks, mainly pertaining to the wide profit margins of the bulk land sales and industrial land sales. Modernland has a 20-year record in developing industrial estates, and has built strong relationships with tenants. Its flagship industrial estate in Cikande in the western part of Java island has a very low average land cost, compared with the current average selling price (ASP) of around IDR1.7 million per square metre (sqm), and Modernland has sufficient land to continue developing there for more than five years, assuming no further land acquisitions. Fitch believes Modernland can build on its success in Cikande and use a similar business model for future developments in its other industrial estate in Bekasi, also in western Java. Limited Residential Track Record: Fitch expects Modernland's residential and commercial property segment to account for an average of 50% of Modernland's attributable presales in 2017-2020, driven by the JGC project and new launches in Bekasi. The growing proportion of residential sales will counterbalance volatility in industrial land sales, but Modernland's track record in developing integrated, large-scale residential projects is still limited relative to the other rated developers. Land Sales to ASRI: As of end-2016, ASRI completed the purchase and payment of 120 hectares of land out of the agreed 170 hectares. Currently Modernland and ASRI are in further discussion regarding the purchase of the remaining land, with no specific timeline for completion. Modernland believes ASRI may eventually complete the acquisition, given the strategic location of the land in Serpong in western Java. Nevertheless, given the uncertainty of the transaction, Fitch has not included any further land sales to ASRI in its assessment of Modernland's credit profile. Manageable Forex Risk: Modernland has fully hedged the principal of its USD240 million bond using call-spread options, covering rupiah depreciation of up to IDR15,000 per US dollar. However, the company has not hedged the principal of its outstanding USD57 million bond, although we believe that Modernland's wide profit margins may be sufficient to absorb short-term currency volatility. DERIVATION SUMMARY Modernland is well-positioned relative to other Fitch-rated property developers, such as PT Kawasan Industri Jababeka Tbk (KIJA, B+/Stable), PT Alam Sutera Realty Tbk (ASRI, B+/Negative) and Lodha Developers Private Limited (Lodha; B/Negative). Fitch believes that KIJA's stronger recurring interest coverage, lower leverage and the more strategic location of its industrial development compared to that of Modernland supports its higher rating. We also believe ASRI's longer track record in residential developments and more defensive cash-flow mix support a higher rating than Modernland. Relative to Lodha, Modernland's smaller presales scale if offset by its lower leverage profile and higher presales turnover, and Lodha's inability to deleverage in the short to medium term. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: - Attributable presales of IDR2 trillion-2.5 trillion in 2017 - Land acquisition capex of around IDR200 billion in 2017 - Committed construction capex of around IDR1 trillion in 2017 RATING SENSITIVITIES Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action: - Attributable residential presales (excluding bulk land sales) sustained above IDR2 trillion without any material weakening in financial profile Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action: - Attributable presales/ gross debt sustained at less than 40% (2016: 62%) LIQUIDITY Sufficient Liquidity: As of December 2016, Modernland had cash of around IDR400 billion compared with IDR470 billion of maturing short-term debt. We expect the company to post positive free cash flows of around IDR170 billion in 2017, which supports its liquidity. Modernland's capex in the short term is going to be limited to construction costs, which depend on the company's meeting sales thresholds in a particular period. This, coupled with the discretionary nature of land acquisitions, may allow Modernland to accumulate cash and shore-up its liquidity profile. Liquidity is also supported by Modernland's access to local banks and international capital markets. In April 2017, Modernland issued a USD240 million 6.95% senior unsecured bond, which was used to refinance its old USD191 million 9.75% bond. This issuance has extended the company's debt maturity profile, giving it more flexibility in managing cash flows.

The Russian president, who turns 65 in October, might presently look unassailable - but maintaining that grip will get harder every year.  Compared to British Prime Minister Theresa May or U.S. President Donald Trump, the Russian president faces scant internal opposition. Recent anti-corruption protests, however, provided him a reminder that no leader can remain in power forever.  Putin will almost certainly win the March presidential elections. His poll ratings remain high, and Russians have little appetite for the chaos that his fall might bring.  But that doesn’t mean there are no rivals waiting for him to stumble.  Most obvious for now is opposition Progress Party leader Alexei Navalny, whose success in getting thousands of demonstrators out on the streets concerns Putin and those around him. Russian officials have tried to slow Navalny down by bringing multiple legal challenges against his right to run for president; he was sentenced to a 30-day jail term after being arrested ahead of this month’s protests.  If history is any guide, Navalny’s path to any place on a presidential ballot could get even tougher. The anti-corruption activist lost much of his eyesight after unknown assailants threw a caustic liquid in his face earlier this year. He must be painfully aware that many Putin critics have died in suspicious circumstances in recent years. Others have ended up in jail or exile.  MORE FROM REUTERS COMMENTARY Josh Cohen: How Trump can show he's tough on anti-Semitism Anthony Lester: Ireland - Theresa May's latest Brexit blunder For now, the 41-year-old Navalny might prefer to wait. Putin has no natural heir and even if he clings to office in the manner of Zimbabwe’s 93-year-old Robert Mugabe, the Russian leader’s power will wane with age.  Mugabe has survived in part because few have been willing to risk a confrontation when they felt they could let nature take its course. He has struck deals with senior supporters and opposition leaders, all of whom have been positioning themselves for years to move fast once he is gone.  It’s an example increasingly discussed amongst Russians and Russia-watchers. Such a long-term strategy could work for Navalny. That could also be the plan of 51-year-old Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, who held the presidency while Putin sat it out under Russia’s term-limit laws to re-qualify for another presidential run.  Riot police detain demonstrators during an anti-corruption protest in central Moscow, June 12, 2017.Maxim ShemetovOnce regarded purely as a powerless Putin protégé, Medvedev is now seen as having his own powerbase amongst modernizers and moderates. Many of those around Putin may owe their power and wealth to him, but few are simply slavish acolytes. They all have their agendas - and those who are younger will need to survive after the Russian leader has gone.  Even without an immediate threat, Putin must be feeling the pressure. And history shows that a Putin under pressure is more likely to be ruthless about striking out at real and imagined enemies both at home and abroad.  That danger might be aggravated by the unpredictability of the Trump administration and the growing number of situations where U.S. and allied forces are in increasingly close proximity to those of Russia. Monday’s shooting down of a Syrian jet by the U.S. Navy, for example, has further ratcheted up tensions between Moscow and Washington. A close aerial confrontation between Russian and U.S. aircraft over the Baltic on Monday is widely suspected to have been a response to Washington’s actions over Syria.  For now, most Russia watchers believe Putin’s priority has been to reassert Russia as a geopolitical heavyweight that can pitch itself in the same league as countries like the U.S. and China. Ultimately, though, he is likely to put maintaining domestic power ahead of international stature.  Slideshow (2 Images)Until the uprisings of the “Arab Spring,” which Moscow blamed heavily - although not exclusively - on the Obama administration, Putin and the wider Russian establishment appeared mostly happy to work within the Western-built, globalized and largely democratic world. Certainly, they took advantage of its trade and banking opportunities to enrich themselves and boost Russia’s state coffers with energy sales and business deals.  Now Moscow has shifted focus to destabilizing and delegitimizing the institutions of the United States and Europe. U.S. and European sanctions following Russia’s annexation of Crimea may have accelerated this trend - although most analysts believe Putin and those around him still want to maintain at least some access to Western financial systems.  Moscow’s alleged interference in elections in the U.S., France and elsewhere are clearly part of this destabilizing trend. So is the Russian intervention in Syria, designed not just to prop up Bashar al-Assad but show the rest of the world - including Russians - of the dangers when people rise against authority.  If Putin feels threatened at home, he might also be tempted to pick more fights outside of Russia’s borders.  There is no shortage of places that could happen. Western countries worry about direct military or covert action against the Baltic nations of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, formerly part of the Soviet Union but now members of NATO. Countries like Ukraine and Georgia, which lean West but lack NATO membership, may be even more vulnerable.  This year has already seen posturing by Russia and NATO in the Baltic, with more large military exercises planned by both for this year. Some Western officials suspect Moscow may choose to leave troops in its ally Belarus after its large “Zapad” drills in September. That would essentially leave the country under Russian military domination, the Baltic states more encircled and the rest of Europe deeply unsettled.  (Peter Apps is Reuters global affairs columnist.

The volume-weighted average rate of the benchmark seven-day repo traded in the interbank market, considered the best indicator of general liquidity in China, was 2.8058 percent on Friday, nearly 15 basis points lower than the previous week's closing average rate of 2.9513 percent.      Falls in money rates stemmed from rising fiscal expenditures, which eased liquidity stress caused by seasonal cash demand and maturing reverse repos, according to market players.      Fiscal expenditures were increasing towards the month-end to counter maturing reverse repos, liquidity in the banking system was staying at a relatively high level,  the People's Bank of China (PBOC) said in a statement.     In open market operations (OMO), the PBOC drained a net 60 billion yuan ($8.77 billion) through reverse bond repurchase agreements this week, compared with last week's 410 billion yuan net injection, the most since mid-January moves to meet Lunar New Year holiday cash demands.     On Wednesday, the central bank started draining cash via reverse repos for the first time in two weeks. On Friday, it skipped an OMO for the first time since late May, but drained 50 billion yuan from the market, via maturing repos.     Traders said the liquidity drain did not affect market sentiment as money conditions were balanced. A trader at a Chinese bank said most market participants started preparing for the  Macro Prudential Assessments  (MPA) of lenders early this time as June is known as a sensitive period.     Cash conditions are traditionally tight in June, and memories remain fresh of a June 2013 crunch that sent money rates soaring and spooked global markets.     Market watchers said authorities were paying close attention to cash conditions to avoid creating any fresh systemic risks amid the country's deleveraging campaign and tightened regulations.      Regulatory adjustments targeting 'financial leverage' will likely be a dynamic process, rather than one that follows a strict pre-set path,  China International Capital Corp said in a note this week.     Financial News, a PBOC-owned publication, reported on Friday that financial institutions had shown significantly increased confidence to smoothly go through the month-end.      The central bank has provided major commercial banks with sufficient liquidity through tools including medium-term lending facility and reverse repos in June,  the newspaper said, citing the PBOC as saying liquidity was  ample  and market expectations  stable .     Longer-term interest rates also eased this week.     The Shanghai Interbank Offered Rate (SHIBOR) for one-month tenor fell to 4.5890 percent on Friday, compared with 4.6990 percent a week earlier, the highest since April 2015.     The three-month rate fell through the week to 4.6300 percent on Friday, down from 4.7613 percent on June 16.

The works on display included a 16th century marble bust believed to be of Sappho, the ancient Greek writer who wrote passionate love poems to other women, to a 17th century portrait of a bearded woman by Spanish artist Juan Sanchez.  It isn't erotic, that isn't necessary. It is an historical reflection,  Carlos Navarro, one of the exhibition's curators, told Reuters. WorldPride, a festival promoting the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, takes place every few years in a different international city. It is expected to draw up to three million visitors to Madrid between June 23 and July 2. One of the jewels of the selection is a little-known early 19th century ink drawing by one of Spain's most important artists, Francisco de Goya, of a grimacing man dressed in women's clothes with his skirt hitched up and his stockings around his ankles. The drawing bears the handwritten title  El Maricon de la Tia Gila  or  Aunt Gila's Queer . When Goya was not painting commissioned portraits for the royal family, he made etchings depicting ordinary people in Spanish villages in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.  Goya is not using that name in an homophobic way, he's showing that all these people have a place in our society,  said Alvaro Perdices, another curator. The exhibition,  The Other's Gaze.

A fuel glut in China, a hangover from demonetization in India, and an ageing, declining population in Japan are holding back crude oil demand growth in three of the world's top four oil buyers.  The three countries make up a fifth of 97 million barrels per day (bpd) in global oil consumption, and any hiccups among them will mean lower-than-expected oil demand growth in Asia, helping to undercut the OPEC-led effort to support prices.   We are indeed seeing lower demand from more than a few clients - air, marine, road, industrial ... They are actually consuming less fuel than anticipated,  said Michael Corley, managing director of Mercatus Energy Advisors. In China, vying with the United States as the world's biggest oil importer, imports in May were still at a near record of 9 million bpd, but a looming cut in refinery operations is set to hit demand for crude oil in the third quarter.  In India, which overtook Japan as the world's third-biggest oil importer last year, crude imports fell by more than 4 percent between April and May to around 4.2 million bpd C-INIMP, as after-effects of the country's recent demonetization program hit consumption.  For the first five months of the year, India's imports are about flat to the same period last year, following an annual rise of 7.4 percent last year.  In Japan, Asia's most advanced economy, oil demand has been in structural decline for years due to a declining, ageing  population, and the rise of cars with better mileage or that use alternative fuels. Japan in April imported around 3.5 million bpd C-JPIMPTOT, down from a peak of 5.9 million bpd hit in 2005.  FILE PHOTO: Oil tankers are seen in Shandong Haike Group in Dongying, Shandong province, China January 11, 2017.Aizhu Chen/File PhotoCoupled with plentiful supplies, the stuttering demand in Asia has contributed to a 20 percent price fall for Brent crude oil LCOc1 to around $45 per barrel, in what is the biggest slump in a first half of a year since 1997.  Floating Storage In the latest indicator of a supply overhang, traders said that five very large crude carriers (VLCCs) have been chartered in recent days to store unsold oil.  FILE PHOTO: Storm clouds gather over Shell's Pulau Bukom oil refinery in Singapore January 30, 2016.Edgar Su/File PhotoEach VLCC can hold around 2 million barrels of oil, and the five chartered for storage add to around 25 supertankers already sitting in southern Malaysian waters.  In a market condition known as contango, where spot crude oil prices are cheaper than those for future delivery, it is profitable to store oil for a later sales. Currently, spot Brent is almost $1.50 a barrel cheaper than that for delivery in early 2018. <0#LCO:>  If oil prices head lower, floating storage will get more traction,  said Ashok Sharma, managing director of ship broker BRS Baxi in Singapore.  The cheap spot price comes despite the effort led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to cut production by 1.8 bpd that has been in place since January. Doubts over OPEC's compliance with its own targets and soaring U.S. output have led to scepticism that markets will re-balance soon.   The slide in oil prices continues ... as markets remain skeptical of OPEC's ability to balance supplies,  ANZ bank said on Friday.

Historically one of the toughest parks for home run hitters, the current team is slugging them out of Dodger Stadium at a record rate as the New York Mets will attest. Los Angeles hit three home runs Thursday night in a 6-3 victory, giving them 15 in the four-game series that they swept, scoring 36 runs in the process. Justin Turner, Enrique Hernandez and Joc Pederson homered Thursday, running the Dodgers' winning streak to a season-high seven games. It was the 14th straight contest that the Dodgers have hit a home run, tying a franchise record set last season. They have hit 101 home runs this season -- 64 of them at home or 1.64 per game, far beyond the record of 1.33 set in 2000. Related CoveragePreview: Mets at DodgersNew York Mets - PlayerWatchLos Angeles Dodgers - PlayerWatch I think the best part of it is that every guy in contributing,  Turner said afterward.  The history of the stadium is that when it's cold and you see dew on the grass, the ball isn't going to fly as far. When you don't see that moisture, the ball will travel (farther).  Manager Dave Roberts didn't deny that there's more to it than weather.  The ball is flying in baseball, no doubt,  he said.  The ball isn't as heavy as it was, so we're telling everyone to elevate.  The win elevated the Dodgers in the National League West as they lead Colorado and Arizona by 1 1/2 games. Turner hit a solo home run and Hernandez a two-run shot in the third against Mets starter Steve Matz, who went a credible six innings, allowing three hits while striking out eight. The game was tied 3-3 going into the bottom of the seventh when Dodger hitters and Met pitchers combined for a three-run L.A. rally. Pederson greeted reliever Paul Sewald with a first-pitch home run to right field, his fifth of the season. A single and walk sent Sewald out for Jerry Blevins, who walked Hernandez to load the bases. Reliever Pedro Baez was due up, but Roberts wanted him to throw the eighth, so he let Baez hit with the bases loaded and two outs. Blevins walked Baez on four pitches, then walked Austin Barnes to give the Dodgers a 6-3 lead. The Mets have allowed 110 home runs, the second most in the NL, and rank last or next to last in ERA, hits allowed, runs allowed and walks.  Walks and home runs are killing us,  Mets manager Terry Collins said.  In all my years here, walks and home runs have never been a problem. Not this team. It's hard to say what's going on. It's very frustrating.  Met pitchers walked 10 Dodgers Thursday. The Mets have lost seven of eight and are 6-13 in their last 19 road games, with a slew of road games ahead of them into the All-Star break. They have allowed 77 runs in their last 10 games. Hyun-Jin Ryu went five innings, allowing home runs to Curtis Granderson and Travis d'Arnauld. The Dodgers needed five relievers to close it out including Kenley Jansen, who posted a four-out save for his 16th of the season. NOTES: The Mets purchased the contract of RHP Chasen Bradford from Triple-A Las Vegas on Thursday and optioned Wednesday night's starter, Tyler Pill, to Las Vegas. Bradford has been in the Mets system since 2011 as a reliever. He was 1-1 with a 4.26 ERA in 29 games for the 51s. ... The Mets also moved injured LHP Tommy Milone (knee) from the 10- to the 60-day disabled list. ...

The blue-chip CSI300 index settled up 0.9 percent at 3,622.88 points, the highest close in 18 months, while the Shanghai Composite Index added 0.3 percent to 3,157.87 points. For the week, CSI300 jumped 3.0 percent, posting the best week in 2017, while the SSEC rose 1.1 percent. The U.S. index provider said on Tuesday it would add 222 China-listed stocks, many of them big-cap blue chips, to its Emerging Markets Index (EMI), tracked by around $1.6 trillion, with the inclusion process starting June 2018. Analysts expected the inclusion to be a significant boost to China's stock market in the long run and pave the way for global capital inflows into China's A-shares. Tight liquidity conditions have also eased, traders said, with the government recently loosening its tight grip on credit regulations. The central bank also moved to maintain stability in the financial markets at particular times, including providing funds via open market operations ahead of the mid-year macro prudential assessment. On Thursday, shares related to Chinese conglomerates Dalian Wanda Group and Fosun slumped on news the banking regulator had ordered checks on offshore loans to several acquisitive Chinese firms which have been snapping up assets overseas, including Wanda, Fosun, HNA Group and Zhejiang Luosen. These shares, including Wanda Film Holding, and Fosun Pharmaceutical stabilised on Friday, after the companies said operations were normal, while Chinese lender ICBC said the loan assessment was routine. For the week, banking and consumers stocks were among the top performing sectors, as they would represent the biggest weightings of China stocks in the MSCI EMI.

Russia and Iran - which back Damascus - reached agreement with opposition sponsor Turkey on the creation of four  de-escalation zones  in western Syria at talks in the Astana last month.  Faisal Mekdad, the deputy minister, said Syria was  ready for the coming rounds of the Astana and Geneva tracks next month, based on preserving its sovereignty and unity and sparing the blood of its sons , state news agency SANA reported on Thursday. He said Syria was scrutinizing  every letter  of an agreement set out in Astana last month and  will not allow anything thing to pass from which Syria's enemies could benefit . A spokesman for President Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey was quoted as saying on Thursday that under the agreement Turkish and Russian forces would be deployed to the northwestern Syrian province of Idlib - a rebel stronghold. Ibrahim Kalin, the spokesman, also said that a mechanism involving the United States and Jordan - two other important backers of the rebellion against Damascus - was being worked on for southern Syria including the Deraa region.      The four de-escalation zones set out in Astana are located in Idlib, Homs, the Eastern Ghouta region near Damascus, and the southern border with Jordan. The United States has said there are reasons to be skeptical about the de-escalation zones agreed in Astana. Washington has been seeking a bilateral agreement with Russia on creating a zone in southwestern Syria, an area that borders U.S. allies Israel and Jordan.

The government has promised to redress miscarriages of justice after several high profile cases, including wrongful executions of people later proven to be not guilty. But the case of Yu Huan, who on Friday had his life sentence cut to five years following a retrial, has also prompted debate about whether widespread public anger over the initial verdict had a bearing on the much more lenient final outcome.  Yu, from Liaocheng in Shandong province, was sentenced to life in jail in February after he used a knife to attack four of his mother's creditors who taunted and exposed themselves to his mother while demanding a 1 million yuan ($146,000) debt be repaid in April last year, according to state media. One of the creditors died. In demanding repayment, one of the creditors exposed his  nether regions  and  gyrated  in front of Yu's mother while flicking cigarette butts at her and forcing her to smell Yu's shoes, the Shandong High Court said in its judgment. Widely referred in media as the  Dishonored Mother case , the initial sentence evoked widespread sympathy for Yu, whose defense of his mother resonated in a country where filial piety is considered a core value. The court said that while Yu acted in part to protect his mother, a five-year sentence was appropriate given his actions went beyond reasonable self-defense, and that he later resisted arrest when police arrived. The verdict was a top-trending topic on the Weibo social media platform. While many users were pleased the court took into account he was protecting his mother, some felt a five-year jail term was too lenient.  Public opinion has to an extent influenced the judiciary,  one Weibo user said. Acknowledging the interest in the case, the court released a statement explaining how it reached its verdict.   The media coverage of the Yu Huan case has ignited widespread attention,  it said.

Delabrière took over as chairman of Zodiac's executive board in June, a fortnight after the company agreed on the deal with Safran.  Zodiac...has very important problems with failures in operational systems that need to be solved as soon as possible,  Delabrière told Les Echos business newspaper. Zodiac has been behind schedule in the production and supply of its products, such as aircraft seats and toilets, which disrupted some airplane deliveries.  The first among the priorities is to solve the problems of our clients,  Delabrière told Les Echos. It said earlier in June that efforts to resolve problems in a UK plant that had disrupted the supply of business-class seats for the Airbus A350 plane were now going according to plan.

The bank said it was not aware of the prosecutors' request. (*) Veneto Banks A clumsy attempt by Italy to tackle problems at two Veneto-based banks by allowing a major lender to cherry-pick their prime assets for a pittance has left the government testing the boundaries of European law. With a deal expected within days, critics are concerned that Rome is exploiting loopholes to bend EU rules designed to prevent state bailouts. The rescue operation for the two Veneto-based banks has received an informal green light from the European Commission, reported Il Messaggero. The government decree which envisages the effective liquidation of Banca Popolare di Vicenza and Veneto Banca, could be put together  in the next hours  or Monday at the latest, reported Corriere della Sera. The rescue of the two banks could cost between 12 billion and 13 billion euros, with the State paying 8-9 billion euros of the total, La Stampa reported. The approval of the plan to rescue the two regional lenders could arrive as early as this weekend, reported Il Sole 24 Ore, adding that the lenders' soured assets will be grouped in a bad bank with a gross value of 20 billion euros. Italian Economy Minister Pier Carlo Padoan and European Commission's Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager may talk today, reported la Repubblica (*) Banca Carige Italian market watchdog Consob has requested access to the minutes of the lender's last board meetings, particularly those related to the resignation of three board members and the no-confidence vote against former CEO Guido Bastianini, la Repubblica and Il Sole 24 Ore reported, citing Radiocor news agency.

The announcement, which comes as several other banks prepare a similar move, shows financial groups are pressing on with plans to relocate part of their businesses, regardless of the shape of a final deal reached in Brexit divorce talks. Such moves are set to further bolster Frankfurt's influence. Despite its small size and dull image, the city is favoured because it is the financial capital of Europe's biggest economy and also home to the European Central Bank. Nomura, Japan's biggest brokerage, has also picked Frankfurt as its EU headquarters after Brexit, one person with knowledge of the matter said. Several other banks are poised to make a similar move, said two people familiar with those discussions. Daiwa had previously said it favoured the German city, because London-based staff could easily be transferred to its investment banking branch there. Daiwa said in a statement on Thursday it would apply for a licence in Germany and its move would  ensure that Daiwa can continue to service its clients in EU after the United Kingdom leaves . The group has said it would still keep staff in London even after Brexit. It has 450 staff working in the EU now, mostly in the British capital. Frankfurt, which has long grappled with an unfavourable backwater image, promotes itself as a stable city for banks seeking to relocate, while the German government and politicians have discreetly welcomed those looking to move. Britain's future following Brexit talks to leave the trading bloc is more uncertain than ever after an election where voters denied its Prime Minister Theresa May a majority in parliament. Against this backdrop, Germany's steady, if sometimes grey, image holds appeal.

FINMA did not release the name of the person in a statement, but Swiss media identified him as Hans Ziegler, who held board roles at Swiss companies Schmolz & Bickenbach and OC Oerlikon and German robot maker Kuka. He was placed under investigation by FINMA and the Swiss attorney general's office last year. FINMA said the case marks the first time it has moved against a person who was not an employee at one of the Swiss financial institutions that it oversees directly. Since 2013, the agency has been tasked with investigating all market manipulation and insider trading in Switzerland.  The FINMA investigation also revealed numerous indications that the individual also illegally used insider information received from his professional network to make substantial investments and related profits in the context of stocks of other companies in which he was not active,  the agency said in its statement. FINMA said it became aware when its employees noticed  conspicuous trading volumes and price developments  during the course of its market supervision. Ziegler resigned from Kuka, Schmolz & Bickenbach and Oerlikon after the investigation began. The Swiss attorney general's office, with which FINMA has been coordinating the case against Ziegler, told Reuters earlier this week that its investigation was ongoing.

The legislative assembly joined the central bank and lender Barclays Africa in seeking a court review of Public Protector Busi Mkhwebane's proposal to change the central bank's primary mandate of maintaining currency and price stability to focus on economic growth.  Parliament believes that the remedial action (mandate change), which is binding in terms of the law, usurps the powers of the institution under the Constitution,  it said in a statement posted on its website.  Parliament will accordingly initiate a court application to have this remedial action set aside on the basis of its unconstitutionality.  Mkhwebane made her proposal to a Pretoria news conference on Monday where she delivered her findings on an apartheid-era bailout of Barclays Africa Group. The lender has denied any wrongdoing. Her call threatens to further stain South Africa's image as an investor-friendly emerging market, coming less than a week after mines minister Mosebenzi spooked investors by raising the minimum threshold for black ownership of mining companies to 30 percent from 26 percent. The independence row over the South African Reserve Bank has also highlighted divisions within the tripartite alliance of the ruling African National Congress, the country's biggest union, Cosatu, and the South African Communist Party.

The Anglo-Dutch company is this week launching Persil Powergems, a brand new kind of detergent that is neither powder nor liquid, after spending 18 million euros ($20 million) on research, development and marketing. It remains to be seen whether the premium-priced, lentil-shaped crystals will make their way beyond Britain, the launch market. Not all innovations are hits, as Unilever learned when its now-abandoned Persil Power was found to damage clothes in the 1990s. But if successful, Powergems could strengthen Unilever's No. 2 position behind Procter & Gamble in a global retail laundry market worth $74 billion and lift the company, which investors are closely watching to see if its new cost-savings promises will hurt long-term growth.  We're not holding back or saying we have to pause, that we can't do this this year or next year, no. We are going straight ahead, investing as much as is needed,  Nitin Paranjpe, president of Unilever's home care business, told Reuters. This project, code-named  Dazzle,  was well on its way at the Port Sunlight R&D; lab in northwestern England in February when Unilever fought off a surprise $143 billion bid from Kraft Heinz that forced changes designed to show it can improve performance as an independent company.  It would've been throwing money away to not launch this one, but the question is, will we see more of these going forward?  said Liberum analyst Robert Waldschmidt.  They need to keep doing this type of thing because driving innovation is the lifeblood of big, branded companies.  Evolving consumer tastes and an onslaught of new, upstart brands that can gain popularity quickly mean that traditional multinationals need to improve their portfolios faster to protect market share. Frugality Paranjpe said Unilever's heightened frugality would not interfere with that, and said adopting the  zero-based budgeting  approach making waves across the sector does not automatically mean investments will be cut. For example, he said the company's R&D; budget, of about 1 billion euros a year, was not being cut. Zero-based budgeting (ZBB)is an accounting method whereby all expenses must be justified from scratch for each new period. The approach, responsible for the fat profit margins at Kraft Heinz, is spreading throughout the industry as growth slows.  Many people have given ZBB a bad name, only thinking of it in terms of indiscriminately cutting things to shore up the bottom line. We don't believe in that,  Paranjpe said, citing Unilever's promise to reinvest two-thirds of the 6 billion euros in savings it has targeted. He said his 10 billion euros-a-year home care business was a little ahead of its cost-savings plans.  It has given us a pot that has enabled us to invest in initiatives,  he said, referring to the 18 million euro splashout on Powergems, which covered things like a new line at its Warrington factory and new technology that allows fragrance molecules to cling to fabric throughout the wash. In addition, he said a recent restructuring has helped speed cooperation between groups, allowing for more quick, local projects, such as a Thai laundry soap for black clothes rolled out in only two months after the death of the king sparked a year-long period of mourning. Keith Rutherford, head of R&D; for Unilever's home care business, said creativity is often boosted by restrictive guidelines. He cited financial or environmental concerns, which are both common on his team, which designs lots of goods for developing and emerging markets where disposable incomes are limited.  The more I constrain and say 'I want you to innovate on less than two euro cents per unit, or without the use of water', everyone initially says it can't be done,  Rutherford said in Port Sunlight, built in the 19th century by William Lever to house his soap factory workers.  And then about two weeks later, someone says they can.

Geely in May said it would buy 49.9 percent of Proton from conglomerate DRB-HICOM Bhd as well as 51 percent of Proton's ownership in British car maker Lotus. The agreement was finalised at a signing ceremony on Friday. With the deal, Geely hopes to grow its own market share in Southeast Asia as it targets sales of 3 million cars by 2020, Chairman Li Shufu said at a press conference in Kuala Lumpur.  For Proton, we hope to help gain back market share in Malaysia, and also expand into Asean,  he said, referring to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. Geely would also consider producing Lotus cars in China, he said.  We hope to help Lotus penetrate the global market.  Geely will buy its Proton stake for 460.3 million ringgit ($107.37 million), including a 170.3 million ringgit cash injection, said DRB-HICOM Managing Director Syed Faisal Albar. Proton's stake in Lotus will be sold for 100 million pounds ($126.99 million) to Geely and a Malaysian firm, he said. DRB-HICOM suspended trading of its shares on Thursday pending the announcement. Proton, founded in 1983 by former Malaysian prime minister Mahathir Mohamad, re-badges cars from foreign manufacturers to sell in the local market. It has struggled in recent years and last year received 1.5 billion ringgit in government aid on the condition it pursues a turnaround plan and seeks a foreign partner. Geely's priority was to make both Proton and Lotus profitable while embracing new technology including electrification, lightweighting and artificial intelligence, Li said.  When they have turned profitable and have sustainable development plans and products, then they can plan to export,  Li said, when asked if Proton would export to China.  There is no limit to it.  Under the purchase deal, Geely is widely expected to take a leadership role in areas including production, manufacturing, sales and marketing, while DRB-HICOM will handle distribution. Geely is the parent of Hong Kong-based Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd and Sweden's Volvo Car Group. $1 = 4.2870 ringgit $1 = 0.7875 pounds Reporting by Liz Lee; Writing by Rozanna Latiff; Editing by Praveen Menon and Christopher Cushing","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/proton-ma-geely-idUSL3N1JK2EV"},

At least, not until his night was done. The right-hander pitched seven strong innings in his major league debut and Robinson Cano hit two home runs, including a grand slam, and drove in six runs as the Seattle Mariners defeated the Detroit Tigers 9-6 on Thursday at Safeco Field. Moore, a 23-year-old who was a second-round draft pick out of Oregon State in 2015, allowed three runs on six hits. He didn't walk a batter and struck out four.  That was unbelievable. I felt like I blinked and it was over,  Moore said.  I was pretty amped up; but, once I threw the first pitch, the nerves sort of went away and I was pretty locked in. ... It still feels surreal.   It was a heck of a debut,  Mariners manager Scott Servais said.  It was awesome to get seven innings out of him, on a night our bullpen was thin.  Cano hit a two-run shot in the third inning and added his slam in the seventh, giving him 13 homers this season, as Seattle (38-37) won its fifth game in a row to move over .500 for the first time this year. The Mariners had failed in four previous attempts to clear that mark. Related CoveragePreview: Tigers at MarinersDetroit Tigers - PlayerWatchSeattle Mariners - PlayerWatch For me it's not about how many home runs I hit,  Cano said.  I'm just trying to do my job with runners in scoring position.  Cano also had high praise for Moore.  I love the way he got on the mound and he put the ball where he wanted,  the second baseman said.  He didn't try to overdo too much. You don't need to throw 97-98 (mph) to be good.  Miguel Cabrera and Ian Kinsler homered for Detroit (32-40), which suffered its season-high sixth consecutive defeat and was swept in a four-game series by the Mariners for only the second time. The other occurred in 1998 at Tiger Stadium.  We kind of fought our way back into the game a little bit, but then Cano's grand slam kind of puts it out of reach,  Tigers manager Brad Ausmus said. The Tigers trailed 9-3 before scoring three times in the eighth against right-hander Max Povse, who was also making his big league debut. After Povse retired the first two batters, Alex Avila doubled and Cabrera hit a two-run shot to right-center field, his eighth homer of the season. J.D. Martinez then doubled down the left-field line and Justin Upton singled to drive him in. That was it for Povse. Tony Zych walked Nicholas Castellanos to bring the potential tying run to the plate, but Zych struck out Andrew Romine to end the threat. Steve Cishek pitched the ninth for his first save of the season. The Mariners opened the scoring in the second as left-hander Daniel Norris (4-5) struggled with his control. Norris walked Nelson Cruz and Danny Valencia, and Ben Gamel lined a two-run double into the gap in right-center field. Gamel scored on a single to right by Guillermo Heredia. Norris got out of the inning as Heredia was caught stealing on a third strike to Mike Zunino. Moore retired the first five batters before allowing a two-out double to Castellanos. Kinsler led off the third with a home run, pulling the Tigers to within 3-1.  The key was staying in good counts,  Moore said.  Kinsler got into a fastball count (at 3-1) and he beat me.  The Mariners struck again in the third on Cano's 398-foot, two-run shot to right-center field. Detroit added two runs in the fifth. Castellanos led off with a double and moved to third on John Hicks' one-out double.

His mother and a couple of his nieces had driven all the way from their home in Oklahoma to watch him play for the first time. The inspired rookie hit a long pinch-hit home run, one of the Atlanta Braves' four long balls, and sparked an eight-run fifth inning that carried Atlanta to a 12-11 victory over the San Francisco Giants on Thursday at SunTrust Park.  They say hitting is contagious and I believe it,  Adams said.  When one guy gets going, the rest fall in line. It was a great inning.  The Braves also counted homers from Nick Markakis, Matt Adams and Brandon Phillips. Markakis had four of the team's 16 hits as Atlanta took three of four games in the series and won for the seventh time in the last 10 games. Lane Adams connected against reliever Bryan Morris for a long three-run shot in the fifth, when the Braves opened the inning with six consecutive hits. It was the first major league homer for Adams, who was signed as a minor league free agent in the offseason. Related CoveragePreview: Giants at BravesSan Francisco Giants - PlayerWatchAtlanta Braves - PlayerWatchAtlanta starter Jaime Garcia lasted only 4 1/3 innings before being chased. He allowed six runs on seven hits, two of them homers, and three walks. Rookie Jason Hursh (1-0) got the final two outs of the inning and ended up getting credit for his first career victory. The Giants made it interesting in the ninth inning against closer Jim Johnson. San Francisco scored twice and had runners on first and second when Hunter Pence grounded out to end the game. Johnson earned his 14th save.  That was big. Unfortunately, we weren't able to finish it off. We battled pretty hard this whole game. That's baseball,  Pence said. San Francisco manager Bruce Bochy said,  We had them where we wanted them there in the ninth, we just couldn't finish it off. There's been quite a few of those where we come up just short like we did again tonight.  San Francisco starter Matt Cain (3-7) was knocked out after failing to retire the three batters he faced in the fifth. The right-hander allowed seven runs on 10 hits, three of them homers, in four innings. He has lost six straight decisions. Morris, who followed Cain, got two outs in the fifth but was charged with five runs on five hits and one walk. The bleeding didn't stop until Kyle Crick pitched 2 1/3 innings in his major league debut.  Our guy (Cain) was having his struggles,  Bochy said.  The ball was flying out of here, which we saw, and Matty was a little bit off ... left some pitches up. Morris was up, but he was just missing location. He was off. When you get back-to-back that are off, you're probably going to give up some runs.  San Francisco's Buster Posey was 3-for-5 with two doubles, a home run and three RBIs. Joe Panik and Brandon Belt also homered for the Giants. The Braves jumped on top in the first inning when Markakis hit a two-run homer, his third home run of the season. The Giants answered in the second and took a 3-2 lead. Posey led off with his 10th homer, which slid just inside the right-field foul pole. Cain drove home the two other runs with a two-out double, his first two RBIs of the season. San Francisco went ahead 5-2 in the third on doubles from Posey and Austin Slater. The Braves got a run back in the fourth. Ender Inciarte singled, went to second on an infield grounder and scored when Markakis singled to left. Atlanta cut the deficit to 5-4 when Matt Adams connected for his 13th homer, but the Giants immediately got the run back in the fifth on Panik's fifth homer of the season. The Braves sent 13 batters to the plate in the bottom of the fifth and scored eight runs. Phillips hit his fifth homer, a solo shot, to start the onslaught. Atlanta manager Brian Snitker said,  You talk about a roller coaster of emotions. It's baseball. It happens. Team's aren't going to lay down. They came back. We came back.  NOTES: The start of the game was delayed 1 hour, 26 minutes because of rain. It was the third rain delay in the four-game series. ... Atlanta sent 3B Rio Ruiz to Triple-A Gwinnett and recalled INF Jace Peterson. Ruiz hit .175 with two home runs in 30 games. Peterson was batting .338 in 17 games with the G-Braves. ... San Francisco LHP Madison Bumgarner threw 45 pitches in a two-inning simulated game Wednesday. He will make a three-inning appearance Sunday. ... The Giants finished the road trip 1-7 and have lost nine of their last 10. ... The teams combined for seven home runs, the most for a single game at SunTrust Park.

It has defended tight controls as necessary to ensure national security and social stability. China's Twitter-like service Sina Weibo, popular online video site ACFUN and news portal Ifeng.com will have to stop video streaming services that violate the country's regulations, the TV and film watchdog said on Thursday. It did not give any specific timeframe for when these programmes should be taken down and whether the move was permanent.  This will provide a clean and clear Internet space for the wide number of online users,  the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television said in a brief statement on its website.

The IMF said on Wednesday Malwai’s economy was on the right track after the fund completed its ninth and final review of the country's economic performance under a program supported by an extended credit facility (ECF), allowing the global lender to make the loan.  This is a very positive development because it signals that we are on the right track with our economic agenda and will help push for the much needed return of budget support,  Finance Minister Goodall Gondwe told Reuters on Thursday. The loan brings total disbursements under the ECF arrangement, signed in 2012, to about $191.4 million.  Strengthening public financial management, including through strong commitment controls, routine bank reconciliations, and regular fiscal reporting, remains critical to preventing the misappropriation of public funds and rebuilding trust and confidence in the budget process,  the IMF said in a statement. Foreign aid has historically accounted for about 40 percent of the national budget. Western donors led by former colonial ruler Britain froze budget support over a corruption scandal in which public servants siphoned millions of dollars from the public purse. The World Bank resumed its budget aid to Malawi last month .

Coleman, who has clocked a season-best 9.82 seconds, slowed down noticeably in his heat but still ran 9.93 on a blazing afternoon where track temperatures topped 43 degrees Celsius at a meet that doubles up as world championships trials.  Yeah, I have complete confidence in myself that I can beat anybody I get on the line with, whether it's him (Usain Bolt) or anybody else,  Coleman said of his chances against the world record holder in the Jamaican's final 100 meters at the London championships in August. Olympic silver medalist Gatlin was not far behind the 21-year-old Coleman time wise, winning his heat in 10.00 seconds as he fights back to full fitness following a string of injuries.  It's a surreal time for me,  Gatlin said of being able to compete with America's young sprinters.  I am a older guy in a year that I'm probably the most injured I have ever been.   Isiah Young won a third heat in 9.97 and Mike Rodgers was second to Gatlin, also in 10.00, but U.S. record holder Tyson Gay failed to advance, as the 34-year-old finished 15th overall in 10.17 after stumbling at the start. The semi-finals and finals of both the men's and women's 100m are set for Friday. Double Olympic medalist Tori Bowie continued her fine form in the women's sprint, leading qualifying in 10.90 with Morolake Akinosun second fastest in 10.98 and world indoor champion Barbara Pierre a winner of her heat in 10.99.

Mandatory Credit: Kirby Lee-USA TODAY SportsMead for Speed World 400 meters champion Allyson Felix also advanced with the seventh fastest time of 11.03. Felix is running the 100m and 200m in Sacramento as speed work for the 400m in London, where she already has a wild card as reigning champion. Temperatures had dropped considerably by the 10,000m finals but Hassan Mead had too much heat for the rest of the field as he ended Olympic marathon bronze medalist Galen Rupp's eight-year run as the U.S. men's champion. Slideshow (3 Images)Mead edged Kenya-born Shadrack Kipchirchir to win in 29:01.44 as Rupp could only finish fifth, more than three seconds behind the winner.    National record holder Molly Huddle pulled away to take the women's race in 31:19.86. The top three finishers in each event plus wild cards will earn selection to the U.S. world championships team, provided they have met the qualifying standard.  Former national 800m champion Alysia Montano, wearing a Wonder Woman T-shirt, ran the championships for the second time in four years while pregnant. Five months with child this time, she finished last in the preliminaries in 2:21.40. Montano was eight months pregnant when she ran at the championships in 2014.  There is something about coming out to any venue not really expecting to win but going along with the journey and seeing what comes out of it,  she said.

Goldman Sachs and Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAML) dominate the sector, using stock and bond issues, the sale of naming rights, and securitisations of future ticket and TV revenues to fund improvements in infrastructure. With financial fair play rules curbing the sums deep-pocketed owners can spend, the banks are hoping to capitalise on clubs' need for new sources of financing.  We are building on a base in Europe, what we call greenfield. I want to get to 60 stadiums done, I'm on 40 now,  said Goldman Sachs' Greg Carey, one of the biggest names in U.S. sports finance, who now comes to Europe once a month. Goldman and BAML were among banks that lent Tottenham Hotspur, known as Spurs, 400 million pounds ($512.32 million) in May to help finance a new 61,500-seat stadium in London. The five-year loan is secured on the new stadium and related commercial and match day revenues. Carey has orchestrated stadium deals worth more than $20 billion for the New York Yankees, San Francisco 49ers and other elite American teams and has arranged private transactions for Italian soccer clubs AS Roma and Inter Milan. The banks do not disclose how much they make from sports financing but  the margins are very, very attractive  said Chris Wheeler, banking analyst at Atlantic Securities.  Yes, it's profitable. It's not a big people business, you don't need 500 traders to do it ... You need a small team. And there are only so many stadiums being built, so you don't need vast resources.  The margins charged reflect risks including the chance that future revenues might not stack up to pay off the debt taken on. For Europe's big soccer clubs there is the annual prospect of a sharp fall in earnings if they fail to qualify for the Europe-wide Champion's League competition or are relegated to a lower division. Early this century, English club Leeds United was relegated and had to sell players and its stadium after borrowing heavily to chase a Champions League place but missing out. Investors took heavy losses. Construction projects can also be subject to cost overruns and delays, as with the rebuilding of London's Wembley Stadium. These risks can be offset by ensuring stadium projects can generate additional revenue from hosting concerts or other sporting events. Spurs plan to host two NFL games a year. The Two Main Rivals BAML started its sports finance and advisory practice in 1992 and has helped bankroll stadia including a $1.2 billion 80,000 seat arena for the Dallas Cowboys that opened in 2009 and also the Yankees' stadium.  We decided there was a good business model here. We provide a full platform -- investment banking, capital raising, corporate banking,  said managing director Elliott McCabe.  The U.S. market is highly developed for financings in the sports sector. Our biggest focus growing up has been domestically in the U.S..  We have interest in Europe. There are many well-run clubs with strong ownership groups,  he added.  However, every situation is unique, it's not cookie-cutter.  The deals can require banks to put in a lot of their own money, one reason U.S. banks have an edge over European rivals with less available balance sheet to put to work. Goldman and BAML often write big cheques -- Goldman committed $850 million so construction could start on the San Francisco 49ers' Levi's Stadium.  How do we help the clubs become more competitive?  Carey said.  By building better facilities so they can put more money into the team, so they can be potentially better and play in the Champions League and make more money. So it's a virtuous cycle.  With their new stadium, Spurs aim to boost earnings like arch-rivals Arsenal have done since moving into the Emirates Stadium -- itself financed by borrowing against future ticket sales -- in 2006. Arsenal's matchday revenues of 134 million euros in 2015/16 were more than double Spurs' 55 million euros, according to Deloitte analysis which shows Europe's top clubs made just 18 percent of revenues from matchday income in the 2015/16 season. That makes upping capacity or getting fans to spend more with better facilities a main lever for increasing cashflows. TV and broadcasting rights, which are mostly collectively arranged, generated 39 percent of revenues, while 43 percent came from commercial income such as advertising and merchandising. The Spurs deal and proposals by Dutch team Feyenoord include plans to regenerate the area around their stadiums. Similar promises of regeneration have seen U.S. city authorities put money into stadium projects in the last decade, often raised via a hotel tax. But the economic benefits are disputed. Stanford economist Roger Noll is among those who say such public/private partnerships have provided poor value because the additional revenue raised as a result of the development does not cover the funding provided. Museum of Sports Europe's love affair with soccer means it is seen as the main area of opportunity there. Big-name teams including Feyenoord, Italy's AS Roma and Fiorentina, Chelsea and Everton in England and Spanish team Barcelona all have plans for new or improved stadia seating up to 100,000 people. The experience of the New England Patriots shows what an impact a new stadium can have. Since the Boston-based NFL team moved into the Gillette Stadium in 2002, they have won five Superbowls and are now the sixth most valuable sports team in the world, with a franchise worth $3.4 billion, according to Forbes. Then at Citigroup, Carey made his name with an innovative financing deal for the stadium that allowed owner Robert Kraft to raise $325 million at low interest rates by pledging future revenues from advertising, naming rights and other income. The sports-mad 56-year-old from Long Island's office at Goldman is filled with memorabilia.

They feel overwhelmed,  said Loof, who works for Doctors without Borders (MSF), in a clinic aboard the Aquarius rescue ship which plies the Mediterranean to save migrants off the Libyan coast.  They need a scapegoat. They need to blame someone, and we are a soft target.  Almost four years into a migration crisis that has brought more than half a million people by boat from North Africa to Italy and turned the Mediterranean into a watery grave for 13,000 people, Italian political parties and media have found a new target for blame: the aid workers who rescue people at sea. In February, a prominent prosecutor launched a fact-finding probe accusing aid groups of being in cahoots with smugglers. With an election looming, the accusations were taken up by the main opposition political parties, the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and the far-right Northern League. Parliament launched its own investigation. The critics accuse aid workers of operating a  taxi service , effectively aiding smugglers by providing the final leg of the journey: taking people off unsafe boats near the coast of Libya and bringing them to Italy. Catania Chief Prosecutor Carmelo Zuccaro, who launched the probe, has gone even further, suggesting the rescuers are being paid off by the smugglers themselves.  Some NGOs could be financed by traffickers and I know there has been direct contact  between them, Zuccaro told state TV Rai in April. Since he made the public allegations, though without opening a criminal investigation or presenting any evidence, media have turned on the rescuers with fury.  Pact between NGOs and traffickers, the government knew everything and now it wants to cover it up,  read an April front page of Il Giornale, a newspaper owned by the brother of four-time Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. Simple Answers The rescue workers say the willingness of many Italians to believe such accusations is a sign of frustration from a public that sees no sign that boat arrivals are abating.  I know people like simple answers. So it's simple just to say: 'It's the NGOs that are bringing people in.' End of story,  said Marcella Kraay, project coordinator with MSF on board the Aquarius, which is run jointly with charity SOS Mediterranee.  But the situation is much more complex than that... Why do they have to take this horrendous journey? There are a lot of problems and they're big and complex. The focus should be how are we going to solve that and not shoot the messenger, which is actually what's happening.  MSF, SOS Mediterranee and the other rescue operations have repeatedly denied wrongdoing and say they have no contact with Libya-based smugglers. Most of their money comes from private donations, and many have offered to share their funding details with the Catania court, saying they have nothing to hide.  But the accusations have clearly taken a toll in public opinion. A poll taken two months after Zuccaro's allegations showed only a third of Italians trust the rescue charities, while half did not. A separate survey by pollster SWG said more people viewed migrants as a problem rather than as victims of a humanitarian crisis, a reversal from a year earlier.  Migration is not ending and is not controlled, and this weighs a lot on public opinion,  said Maurizio Pessato, president of SWG.  It will be a decisive issue going into next year's election.  Virtually all the migrants picked up by charities are brought to Italy instead of Libya, which is considered unsafe, and about half ask for asylum. Almost 200,000 asylum seekers are living in the country's state-funded shelters. Nick Romaniuk (L) and Max Avis of the NGO SOS Mediterranee take a last look at a rubber boat that they destroyed so that it cannot be used again by people smugglers off the coast of Western Libya May 18, 2017. Picture taken May 18, 2017.Steve Scherer The Monster  As the Aquarius edged out of the port of Catania on May 13 on its way to the waters off Libya, a small motor boat carrying a handful of protesters shouting  No more illegal migrants!  pulled along side. The far-right Identitarians group behind the protest says it wants to preserve Europe's national identities against a migrant  invasion .   The Italian coastguard intervened, forcing the boat to retreat, but the stunt was streamed online by Canadian conservative activist Lauren Southern.  The monster is coming,  she says of the Aquarius, which  has been illegally bringing in migrants from the Libyan ocean for the last while and they're just heading out again to bring in more illegal migrants and we are going to stop them.   The Identitarians have raised more than 70,000 euros  ($78,100) to equip a vessel and send it to sea, Lorenzo Fiato, one of organizers, told Reuters.   The aim is to take migrants back to Libya and not bring them to Italy,  Fiato said.  It's an NGO ship in reverse.  A migrant boat is set on fire by the Libyan coastguard after NGO ships rescued the migrants about 20 miles off the coast of Western Libya, May 18, 2017. Picture taken May 18, 2017.Steve SchererIn February, Italy and the EU signed an a memorandum of understanding with the United Nations-backed government in Tripoli pledging millions of euros, equipment and training to fight people smuggling, run U.N.-managed migrant camps and bolster the coastguard. The aim is to block migrants in Libya just as they were stopped in Turkey after the EU brokered a deal with Ankara last year. That arrangement mostly put a halt to the  Balkan route , the other main route into Europe, which saw around a million people take boats from Turkey to Greece in 2015, and then make their way north through the Balkans to rich countries like Germany. But the accord with Tripoli has yet to have a similar impact slowing boat departures across the Mediterranean from Libya. On the contrary, smugglers are sending migrants at a record pace. 170 Jumbo Jets This year 71,000 boat migrants, enough to fill 170 jumbo jets, have been rescued and brought to Italy, a 26 percent increase on the same time period last year. Two thousand are already estimated to have drowned this year, with the peak summer season for making the voyage still to come. The role of charities in the rescues has grown as Italian and EU militaries have pulled back from Libyan coast. In 2014, when Italy ran its own search-and-rescue operation called Mare Nostrum, charities carried out less than one percent of all rescues. So far this year, they have carried out more than a third of rescues, according to Italy's coastguard, which coordinates all the rescues from Rome. EU border agency Frontex and its anti-smuggling mission Sophia make a point of patrolling at a distance from the Libyan coast, arguing that if they come too close to shore they encourage smugglers. The charities say that leaves them no choice but to operate closer to Libya to rescue people who would otherwise be abandoned to drown. The already unseaworthy migrant boats are badly overloaded and would not make it to Italy before sinking.  Last year on one day there were 10,000 people who left Libya and went to sea,  said Nick Romaniuk, a member of the rescue team on the Aquarius, as it steamed toward Italy with 560 migrants safely on board.  That means if the boats go out and there's no one there to save them, potentially 10,000 people could die in a single day. I don't think that's a chance we can take.

They have sent Doha a list of 13 demands including closing Al Jazeera television, reducing ties to their regional adversary Iran and closing a Turkish military base in Qatar, an official of one of the four countries told Reuters. Turkey, which has long tried to play the role of regional mediator, has backed Qatar in the dispute but is also wary of upsetting its other allies, including Saudi Arabia.   Since June 5 exports to Qatar have amounted to $32.5 million. Of this $12.5 million is food. This figure is three times the normal level,  Tufenkci told reporters at a Ramadan fast-breaking dinner on Thursday evening. Turkey has sent more than 100 cargo planes of supplies to Qatar but Economy Minister Nihat Zeybekci has said it was not sustainable to maintain supplies through an air lift. On Thursday, Turkey sent its first ship carrying food to Qatar and dispatched a small contingent of soldiers and armored vehicles there, while President Tayyip Erdogan spoke with Saudi Arabia's leaders on calming tension in the region. Turkey fast-tracked legislation on June 7 to allow more troops to be deployed to a military base in Qatar that houses Turkish soldiers under an agreement signed in 2014.

With a deal expected within days, critics are concerned that Rome is exploiting loopholes to bend EU rules designed to prevent state bailouts. One European official privately admitted to  exasperation , after the European Central Bank and European Commission have tussled with Rome for years over how to solve its banks' problems within EU law. On Wednesday, Italy's biggest retail bank Intesa Sanpaolo laid down tough conditions to buy the healthy parts of the two Veneto banks for just 1 euro, a move that would force the state to foot the bulk of the bill. Intesa said it would only take the banks if they were stripped of bad loans and risks, prompting criticism from those who designed the EU regime to stop the state from having to shoulder losses in bank crises, passing them on to investors instead. That solution also contrasts starkly with Santander's recent overnight rescue of a struggling lender in Spain, where it too paid just 1 euro but took on the smaller bank's troubled loans and will raise billions to clean it up. Rome is taking advantage of a flexibility in European rules that permits routine insolvency proceedings for banks not considered systemically important, allowing the process to be handled by the state rather than EU authorities. One EU official said state aid in this case might be technically possible given that banks' shareholders and junior bondholders are also going to take a hit. But critics said Italy was being allowed to cut corners.  The Italians do not respect the rules. The ECB and the Commission are too weak to enforce them,  said Sven Giegold, a German member of the European Parliament.  This is destroying trust.  Italy is the last country in the euro zone to get to grips with the problems of its banking sector, meaning it faces stricter 'bail-in' rules - written by Giegold and others and introduced last year - that impose losses chiefly on bondholders and investors. With elections due next year and much of its banks' debt in the hands of ordinary Italians, Rome wants to avoid this step.  The signals from Italy are very negative,  said Volker Wieland, one of the German government's economic advisors. Wieland accused Italy of  looking for exceptions  to the rules, warning that such an approach would discourage Germany from supporting any common European protection of deposits, a proposal made to underpin confidence in the region's lenders. The ECB, which supervises Italian banks, and the EU Commission, which rules on whether state support can be allowed, have declined to comment on the Italian proposal, saying they await a formal announcement from Rome. No Hiding Place At home too the tactics in Rome - after more than six years of procrastination through the country's banking crisis - are raising questions. The government had hoped healthier Italian banks would club together to help the lenders, Banca Popolare di Vicenza and Veneto Banca. But most demurred, having already spent billions propping up ailing banks, including through the government-sponsored Atlante fund that pumped 3.4 billion euros into the Veneto banks and is now set to be wiped out. Others had problems of their own, such as Monte dei Paschi, which is being bailed out by the state using another exception to the EU rules. Most banks said the government should stop asking them to chip in, and use instead the 20 billion euros it set aside for bank rescues, negotiating terms with Brussels. Opposition politicians have been critical.  Intesa gets a free gift, the state takes on all the bad stuff and the taxpayer pays,  said Renato Brunetta, parliamentary leader for former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia (Go Italy!) party, estimating the cost for the Italian state could be 5-6 billion euros.  Did we really need to take so much time to come up with such a rubbish solution?  Carla Ruocco, a prominent lawmaker of the 5-Star movement, echoed this view:  By wasting years, the government put itself in a bind.

The central bank kept its benchmark interest rates steady on Friday before the markets opened, saying the current monetary policy was appropriate as it expected the economy to recover in the second half of the year. The spot rupee, which has been trading for five straight sessions after being inactive for six weeks, was at 153.20/30 per dollar at 0502 GMT, compared with Thursday's close of 153.15/25. The spot rupee resumed trading on Monday for the first time since May 5 when the central bank had fixed its reference rate at 152.50.  There is (dollar) demand today and there is no intervention or moral suasion,  said a currency dealer, requesting anonymity. Dealers said they expect seasonal demand for the dollar to pick up from August. The rupee has been under pressure after the central bank said it would allow gradual depreciation of the currency and set a target of $1.2 billion in direct market purchases of dollars to boost the island nation's reserves this year, mainly to meet a target set by the International Monetary Fund for a three-year $1.5 billion loan. Analysts said the rupee's weakening is a key concern in the future.  If, as we expect, the Fed tightens monetary policy more aggressively than the market expects over the coming months, there is a risk that this could lead to further falls in the (rupee) currency against the U.S. dollar,  Krystal Tan, Asia economist at Capital Economics, said in a research note.

Financial spreadbetter CMC Markets sees European markets opening modestly weaker, with Britain's FTSE 100, Germany's DAX and France's CAC 40 all seen shedding points in early trade. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was nearly unchanged on the day, and was up 0.4 percent for the week. The Shanghai Composite slipped 0.7 percent while China's blue-chip CSI300 index was down 0.3 percent. The latter earlier this week hit an 18-month high on excitement over MSCI's decision to include mainland shares in a key index.  Investors have no incentives today to take new positions ahead of the weekend,  said Mitsuo Shimizu, equity strategist at Japan Asia Securities in Tokyo. Japan's Nikkei stock index was slightly higher in afternoon trade, on track to log a rise of 0.9 percent for a week in which it touched its highest levels since August 2015.  The actual macro situation in Japan is pretty good,  said Ed Rogers, head of Rogers Investment Advisors in Tokyo, who noted the country's streak of five quarters of positive gross domestic product numbers. He said the dollar remained bolstered against the yen by the Federal Reserve's move to hike interest rates last week and leave the door open for further monetary tightening later in the year.  We're not seeing global inflation, but we think the Fed will continue to move. That stone's rolling down the hill,  Rogers said. Longer-term, that will support the dollar and underpin Japanese shares, he added. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was down 0.2 percent at 97.449, though up 0.3 percent for the week. The euro was up 0.1 percent on the day at $1.1163 but was down 0.3 percent for the week, while the dollar was steady against the yen at 111.29, up 0.4 percent for the week.  We're getting close to the end of the month, and fundamentals aside, there will be people selling dollars, so it will be easy for the yen to strengthen next week,  said Mitsuo Imaizumi, Tokyo-based chief foreign exchange strategist for Daiwa Securities.  We also need to keep an eye on the healthcare debate in Washington, because political turmoil tends to undermine the dollar,  he said. U.S. Senate Republicans offered a bill on Thursday to overhaul Obamacare, the next phase in the party's long war against the 2010 law enacted by then-President Barack Obama, though it remained unclear if the bill has enough support to pass the Senate. On Wall Street overnight, U.S. shares put in a mixed performance, though the S&P; healthcare index rose 1 percent and hit its fifth consecutive record close following the release of the Senate Republicans' bill. U.S. economic data on Thursday showed the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits rose slightly last week, but remained at levels consistent with a tight labour market. Home prices also increased in April more than expected. The Mexican peso added 0.1 percent after soaring 1 percent on Thursday as Mexico's central bank board raised interest rates, saying it wanted to anchor inflation expectations and take into account last week's move by the U.S. Federal Reserve to hike borrowing costs. Crude oil futures pulled further away from this week's lows, though market sentiment remained fragile amid a global crude glut that has persisted despite OPEC-led output cuts. Brent crude was up 0.4 percent at $45.40 a barrel. U.S. crude futures also rose 0.4 percent to $42.91 a barrel. Spot gold added 0.2 percent to $1,252.51 an ounce, moving away from a five-week low touched earlier this week.

For the week, however, China blue chips are still on course to post solid gains, cheered by index publisher MSCI's decision to include mainland shares to its emerging market benchmark. The CSI300 index rose in the morning, but a bout of selling toward the lunch break knocked the blue-chip index down 0.4 percent by midday, to 3,576.37 points.

These shares, including Wanda Film Holding, and Fosun Pharmaceutical stabilised on Friday, after the companies said operations were normal, while Chinese lender ICBC said the loan assessment was routine. But the relief was offset as the tech-heavy board ChiNext dropped more than 1 percent, with internet-related firms hit by news that China had told three major web portals to shut down their video and audio streaming services, saying they carry politically-related material that breaks state rules. Also hurting sentiment, Tesla-related stocks tumbled on profit-taking after Tesla Inc said on Thursday that it was in exploratory talks with the Shanghai municipal government on building a manufacturing plant in the city. Shares in Shanghai Lingang Holdings Co Ltd slumped the maximum allowed 10 percent, after the company said it had not contacted Tesla, smashing market rumours. Most sectors in China fell.

Soft-spoken and reserved, 60-year-old Farhana Maute owns property in Mindanao and in Manila, and runs a construction business, say people who know the family and security analysts who have scrutinized its background. Almost unknown two years ago, the Mautes are now the biggest and most deadly among Islamic State groups in the southern Philippines and are at the forefront of a month-long battle with the military for control of Marawi, a Mindanao town. Regional governments fear that the brutal urban warfare, in which 360 people have been killed, reflects Islamic State's intention to establish a caliphate in Southeast Asia. Farhana Maute was related to politicians in her hometown of Butig, near Marawi, and was considered somewhat of a kingmaker because of her wealth and influence. And like many clans in the lawless area, the Mautes maintained a private militia that included Farhana's seven sons, the analysts said. When the Mautes got involved in a dispute with Butig Mayor Dimnatang Pansar over the award of civil contracts, it erupted into a brutal clan feud, a clash so common to Mindanao it has its own name, rido. Other militant groups in the southern Philippines joined the Mautes, and they formed a joint front in Marawi against government troops.  Terrorist Imagery  Joseph Franco, a research fellow at Singapore's S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies who has worked with several Philippine military chiefs, said that early last year, the Mautes projected themselves as followers of Islamic State, or IS, to  spook and coerce the Pansars .  That tactical use of terrorist imagery took on a life of its own,  he said.  And now we have this Maute Group, who call themselves IS-Ranao.  Ranao is an old name for the Lanao region of Mindanao, where Marawi and Butig are located. Although known to be a deeply religious Muslim, there was no evidence that Farhana Maute was radicalized, Franco said.  She is only a businesswoman,  a former military officer who lives in Marawi told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity.  But, her clan was involved in a bitter political dispute with the mayor of Butig. And that probably got her into trouble.  Two of the sons, Omarkhayam and Abdullah, had been educated in the Middle East, but it is uncertain when they morphed from being scions of a wealthy family to becoming hardened Islamists. [nL3N1J61PU] Still, Farhana Maute was related to the former military head of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), a rebel group that the government signed a peace deal with in 2014. She was deeply influenced by him, said Rommel Banlaoi, a security expert who advises the Philippines police.  Many Muslims in Mindanao, strictly speaking, they already have what I call embedded radical ideas,  he said, adding that the Mautes provided a training camp for associates of the MILF near Butig.  They were criminals who morphed into militancy,  Banlaoi said of the Mautes.

Armed Forces of the Philippines/Handout via REUTERS TV/File PhotoOther analysts said at least some of Farhana's wealth would have been diverted to the Maute Group's alleged illicit activities. It was not possible to seek comment from the Maute family.  Both Farhana and her husband Cayamore, an engineer, were arrested earlier this month in separate parts of Mindanao and it was not immediately clear who their lawyers were. The sons are believed to be fighting in Marawi. Islamic State's news agency, Amaq, has said its fighters control large parts of Marawi City, but has not commented specifically on the Maute.

He said he had not seen any of them since 2010, when he moved north. Ampuan was speaking in a bazaar selling mobile phones and accessories in the crowded Novaliches suburb of Manila, where Philippine military intelligence reports have said Farhana or some of her sons owned stalls. All the stall-owners in the Salam Bazaar are from Marawi, but Ampuan said the family did not own any property there. He said Farhana was fluent in Arabic and English and he considered the Mautes a  royal family .  The Mautes are fighting for Allah,  he said.  They want a society faithful to Allah.  Marawi residents and analysts said Farhana has considerable influence on her sons, perhaps more than her husband, Cayamore. He has two other wives.  She is the central figure, but not in terms of planning and preparing attacks,  said Rohan Gunaratna, a regional counter-terrorism expert.  The mother and father are patrons of the group, but father less, mother more.  A neighbor, Marawi city councillor Khana-Anuar Marabur Jr., said the Mautes were  good people back then , before they started the current round of violence in Marawi. He said Farhana was a good mother, and was generous and approachable.  The father is strong,  Marabur said.  He is like the tiger. But someone owns the tiger.

The sensors are leading Big Oil's mining of so-called big data, with some firms envisioning billions of dollars in savings over time by avoiding outages, managing supplies and identifying safety hazards. The industry has long used sophisticated technologies to find oil and gas. But only recently have oil firms pooled data from across the company for wider operating efficiencies - one of many cost-cutting efforts spurred by the two-year downturn in crude oil CLc1 prices. ConocoPhillips (COP.N) says that sensors scattered across its well fields helped it halve the time it once took to drill new wells in Eagle Ford shale basin of South Texas. By comparing data from hundreds of sensors, its program automatically adjusts the weight placed on a drill bit and its speed, accelerating the extraction of oil, said Matt Fox, ConocoPhillips' executive vice president for strategy, exploration and technology. It is just one application, but if applied to the more than 3,000 wells ConocoPhillips hopes to drill in the Texas basin, those small sensors could lead to  billions and billions of dollars  in savings, Fox said in an interview.  We started using data analytics in our Eagle Ford business,  he said.  And everywhere we look there are applications for this.  The cost and complexity of such systems vary widely. Oil giants such as ConocoPhillips buy a mix of off-the-shelf and custom programs, along with data repositories. The Houston-based producer's employees use Tibco Software Inc's Spotfire data visualization package to analyze information from well sites. Tibco declined to discuss its pricing. Services firms including Schlumberger NV (SLB.N) and General Electric Co (GE.N) oil and gas unit sell sensor-equipped gear, data repositories and software to improve producers' decision-making.  Back when oil traded at more than $100 a barrel - before the price crash in 2014 - data analysis was an  afterthought  for most oil firms, said Binu Mathew, who oversees digital products at GE Oil & Gas. Now - with prices at about $43 a barrel after recovering from a low of about $26 in early 2016 -  the efficiency aspect is far, far more important,  Mathew said. Finding Hidden Value A survey by Ernst & Young last year examined 75 large oil and gas companies and found that 68 percent of them had invested more than $100 million each in data analytics during the past two years. Nearly three quarters of those firms planned to allocate between 6 and 10 percent of their capital budgets to digital technology, the survey found. Effectively mining large data sets could lead to supplanting workers with artificial intelligence and machine learning systems, according to firms selling and buying data-driven technology. Simple sensors already increase safety and savings by eliminating the need to send workers to rigs or production facilities to gather data. Automating drilling decisions can produce more consistent results by cutting out human errors, said Duane Cuku, vice president of sales for rig technology at Precision Drilling Corp (PD.TO).  The driller is now able to focus his attention on the well - and the performance and safety of his crews - as opposed to the manual manipulation of controls,  Cuku said. Occidental Petroleum Corp (OXY.N) also uses an analytical tool to find the best design for hydraulic fracturing wells. A new version of the software analyzes data on well completions and geology to recommend whether injecting steam or water would produce more oil. Abhishek Gaurav, a petroleum engineer for closely-held Texas Standard Oil, said he uses big-data analytics to help his company choose which properties to explore.  Using Spotfire, the same program utilized by Conoco, Standard applies a combination of data science and petroleum engineering to rank asking prices for land based on a variety of completion, production and geological variables - such as the amount of sand that likely would be required to complete a well in a given formation. The technique, Gaurav said, has reduced the time needed for evaluating land parcels from weeks to hours - and resulted in better decisions.  We found value in properties when many other teams did not,  he said. RECRUITING IN CALIFORNIA    Some of the information craved by oil firms isn't so easy to gather or analyze.  Surveys and maps that companies use to acquire acreage for drilling, for instance, are often not digitized. Older company data on wells may be unstructured or spread among suppliers using different storage formats, making integration and analysis a challenge.  General Electric and its oil-and-gas unit are moving aggressively into the business of digitizing industrial equipment for other firms, and have invested in large data processing centers for energy clients.  GE sees huge potential for market growth: A company study estimated that only 3 percent to 5 percent of oil and gas equipment is connected digitally, and less than one percent of the data collected gets used for decision-making, the study found. Getting the industry more fully connected will take time.  There is a huge amount of data prep, data sanitization and data extraction needed for big data to be totally disruptive,  said Kate Richard, chief executive at private equity investor Warwick Energy.  She projects a major payoff from the technology is still five or ten years away. Oklahoma City-based Warwick - which manages interests in thousands of wells across Oklahoma and Texas - is preparing for that payoff by hiring people from tech hubs in California, Richard said.  They all have computer programming and data science backgrounds,  she said.

The Yankees had reached five of the previous six Fall Classics before falling to the Angels in the Division Series. But 15 years later, the manager of the team now known as the Los Angeles Angels knows how challenging it is to come back against the Yankees.  Not many times are you going to dig a hole to those guys and get out of it,  Scioscia said Thursday night when the Angels overcame an early deficit by scoring the final nine runs of a 10-5 win over the Yankees at Yankee Stadium. The Angels appeared to be in for a long night when Aaron Judge hit his major league-leading 25th homer -- a mammoth 425-foot three-run shot to straightaway center field -- to cap a four-run second inning and give the Yankees a 5-1 lead. But starter Jesse Chavez and four relievers combined to limit the Yankees to three hits in the final seven innings. Offensively, the Angels climbed back via a patient offense that generated 11 hits -- via nine singles and two doubles -- and went 5-for-8 with runners in scoring position. The Angels also disrupted the Yankees into committing three errors in the seventh and eighth inning, during which Los Angeles scored six runs. Related CoveragePreview: Angels at YankeesLos Angeles Angels - PlayerWatchNew York Yankees - PlayerWatch We did a good job with runners in scoring position, good job running the bases,  Scioscia said.  The whole comeback was done without a ball going out of the park, so it was impressive.  The Angels closed within 5-4 thanks to three RBI singles by Albert Pujols and Yunel Escobar (in the third inning) and Luis Valbuena (in the sixth). In the seventh, Cliff Pennington (3-for-3 with a walk) led off with a single against Yankees starter Luis Severino before American League stolen base leader Cameron Maybin followed with a sharp grounder to second that skipped by Starlin Castro for an error. Pennington scored the tying run on a sacrifice fly by Kole Calhoun against Chasen Shreve. With ace Yankees reliever Dellin Betances on the mound, Maybin then stole second, took third when Gary Sanchez's throw sailed into center field and trotted home on Pujols' go-ahead single.  I love creating chaos, making those guys frantic,  said Maybin, who led the game off with a homer.  You could see it tonight -- I get on base, guys get wary, they get nervous. Guys behind me get good pitches, (the Yankees' pitchers) make mistakes on the mound throwing balls away. That's a part of my game.  Escobar followed with a walk. One out later. Andrelton Simmons laced a two-run double off Betances to extend the Angels' lead to 8-5. Pennington and Maybin teamed up to create havoc again in the eighth, when Pennington doubled with one out and went to third on a wild pitch. Maybin walked, after which Domingo Graham's pickoff throw to first sailed into foul territory. Pennington trotted home and Maybin raced to third before scoring on Calhoun's second sacrifice fly. Maybin and Pennington each scored three runs.  Tonight you're down 5-1 and these guys, they're talking to the pitchers (saying) 'Hey, put up some zeroes here, give us a chance to get some things going,  Scioscia said. Yusmeiro Petit (2-0), the Angels' first reliever, picked up the victory by striking out three in two perfect innings as Los Angeles (38-38) won the three-game series. Chavez allowed five runs, seven hits and two walks whiles striking out three in four innings. Chris Carter was the only player with two hits for the reeling Yankees (39-31), who have lost eight of nine.  It's a number of things we haven't done well,  Yankees manager Joe Girardi said.  We haven't pitched well at times, we weren't able to add on tonight and there were some defensive miscues on our part. If you're going to compete at a high level, you can't keep making the mistakes that we're making.  Severino (5-3), who was lifted after Maybin reached in the seventh, allowed six runs (five earned), eight hits and two walks while striking out five in six-plus innings.  He gets a double-play ball, it takes a bad hop and it changes the complexion of the game,  Girardi said. Betances, who allowed two runs (one earned) in his first 22 2/3 innings this season, gave up two runs in two-thirds of an inning Thursday.

Nowadays, spiders are a source of income for many farmers in Cambodia, one of the world's poorest countries. But some fear that they will be hunted into extinction or will decline rapidly in number because of deforestation.

Asian markets are quite mixed but more on the downside on the continued weakness in oil prices which remained below $43 a barrel,  said Manny Cruz, an analyst with Manila-based Asiasec Equities Inc.      There are expectations that oil prices will continue to retreat in the near term.      Philippine shares fell 0.6 percent with the real estate sector losing the most.

Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas said the conflict in Marawi City in Southern Philippines could have  some impact on growth and inflation.       What is worrying is if this will escalate to other parts of the southern areas. That remains to be seen, but I think the market is slowly looking into that kind of possibility,  Cruz added.

With the second overall pick of the NBA Draft, the Lakers selected 19-year-old local standout Lonzo Ball of UCLA, a player capable of reviving the fast-paced 'Showtime' style that Johnson made famous. At 6-foot-6, Ball is tall for his position, like Johnson was, and similarly heralded for his brilliant passing and ability to push the pace and run the fast break.   In his lone college season, Ball led the nation with 7.6 assists per game and earned first team All America honors. Ball told reporters he was eager to ramp up his hoops education under Johnson.  Obviously, he's the best point guard to ever play,  Ball, wearing a purple-and-gold Lakers hat, said after his selection.  So I'm looking to go in there and just learn from day one.   There's never going to be another Magic Johnson, so I'm trying to be myself,  he said.  But if I can come halfway short of him, you know it's going to be good.  Ball's unusual jumpshot, which he hoists across his body from his waist, has led to some questions about his ability to shoot successfully in the NBA.

For now, though, the Lakers will bank on Ball helping revive a franchise that last made the playoffs in 2013. LaVar Ball, for one, was certain of the team's ascendance under his son.  I'm gonna tell you what: Lonzo Ball is going to take the Lakers to the playoffs his first year,  LaVar, wearing a Big Baller hat in Laker colors, said in a television interview.

Comey was leading the investigation into allegations Russia tried to sway the election toward Trump and the possibility Trump associates colluded with Moscow when the president fired him on May 9, sparking a political firestorm.  Look there has been no obstruction, there has been no collusion,  Trump told Fox News Channel in an interview set to air on Friday. Fox released a partial transcript of the interview on Thursday. The former head of the Federal Bureau of Investigation testified before a Senate committee that Trump had asked him to drop a probe into former national security adviser Michael Flynn's alleged ties to Russia. Earlier on Thursday, Trump said he did not make and does not possess any tapes of his conversations with Comey, after suggesting last month he might have recordings that could undercut Comey's description of events.  I have no idea whether there are 'tapes' or recordings of my conversations with James Comey, but I did not make, and do not have, any such recordings,  Trump wrote on Twitter. Lawmakers investigating allegations of Russian interference in the U.S. election had asked the White House for any such recordings. Related CoverageTrump says he has not obstructed FBI's probe Russia probe: Fox NewsShortly after dismissing Comey, Trump mentioned the possibility of tapes in a Twitter post.  James Comey better hope that there are no 'tapes' of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!  Trump tweeted on May 12. Allegations of ties to Russia have cast a shadow over Trump's first five months in office, distracting from attempts by his fellow Republicans in Congress to overhaul the U.S. healthcare and tax systems.

Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, said Trump still had questions to answer about possible tapes.  If the president had no tapes, why did he suggest otherwise? Did he seek to mislead the public? Was he trying to intimidate or silence James Comey? And if so, did he take other steps to discourage potential witnesses from speaking out?  Schiff said in a statement. CNN reported on Thursday that two top U.S. intelligence officials told investigators Trump suggested they publicly deny any collusion between his campaign and Russia, but that they did not feel he had ordered them to do so.  U.S. President Donald Trump takes the stage for a rally at the U.S. Cellular Center in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, U.S. June 21, 2017.Scott MorganDirector of National Intelligence Dan Coats and National Security Agency Director Admiral Mike Rogers met separately last week with investigators for special counsel Robert Mueller and the Senate Intelligence Committee, according to CNN.  The two officials said they were surprised at Trump's suggestion and found their interactions with him odd and uncomfortable, but they did not act on the president's requests, CNN reported, citing sources familiar with their accounts. Reuters was unable to verify the CNN report. In his interview with Fox, Trump expressed concern about what he described as the close relationship between Comey and Mueller, who was appointed to take over the investigation after Comey was fired.  Well he's very, very good friends with Comey, which is very bothersome,  Trump said, according to the Fox transcript. The Kremlin has denied U.S. intelligence agencies' conclusion that Moscow tried to tilt the election in Trump's favor, using such means as hacking into the emails of senior Democrats. Trump has repeatedly denied any collusion.

Philadelphia went all out to get their man, trading their third overall pick plus a future first-round pick to the Boston Celtics to secure the Maryland native. Known for his all around offensive ability and athleticism, Fultz starred in his lone year at the University of Washington, averaging 23 points per game, along with more than five rebounds and five assists.

It was something out of a dream.  The 6-foot-4 (1.93 m) guard became the second consecutive number one overall pick by Philadelphia, following forward Ben Simmons last year. Fultz, Simmons and another recent Sixers high draft pick, Joel Embiid, form a promising young trio that could allow Philadelphia to rise from the lower depths of the league.

Mandatory Credit: Brad Penner-USA TODAY SportsThe Los Angeles Lakers used the second pick to select homegrown guard Lonzo Ball of UCLA, who led college basketball in assists. At 6-foot-6 (1.98 m), Ball plays a style that harkens back to the 'Showtime' days of the Lakers, dishing off no-look passes, launching threes and finishing at the hoop with rim-jarring slam dunks. Ball became the first high-profile draftee under the regime of new Lakers head of basketball operations Magic Johnson. Slideshow (10 Images) It's crazy, I couldn't ask for anything more, to be able to learn from (Johnson) every day is truly a blessing,  Ball said. Boston, the first team to trade the number one pick before or during the first round of the draft in 24 years, used the third overall pick to add small forward Jayson Tatum of Duke, one of the most polished scorers in college basketball. Phoenix selected versatile forward Josh Jackson from Kansas with the fourth choice before ultra quick point guard De'Aaron Fox of Kentucky was snapped up by the Sacramento Kings.  Speed kills and you can't teach it,  said Fox. With the seventh pick the Minnesota Timberwolves claimed Lauri Markkanen of Finland, who played college ball at Arizona, but the Finn will be headed to Chicago as part of a big trade for All-Star guard Jimmy Butler. After the Knicks selected promising French guard Ntilikina, who is flying right back to Strausbourg to help his club try to win their league championship, two other international players were taken in the first round. Briton OG Anunoby was taken 23rd overall by the Toronto Raptors, becoming the highest drafted English player, and Anžejs Pasečņiks of Latvia was selected 25th overall by the Orlando Magic. additional reporting by Lewis Krauskopf; Editing by Frank Pingue/Peter Rutherford","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-basketball-nba-draft-idUSKBN19D2YR"},

Salman Khan has come a long way from the days of bare-chested fight sequences and gyrating dance numbers – a combination that brought him some of his biggest hits and sent legions of his fans into rapture. In Kabir Khan’s drama, this one-time all-conquering hero has morphed into a bumbling dimwit who bursts into tears at the slightest provocation and can barely land a blow on the bad guys. Khan plays Laxman Singh Bisht, a character that is a strange combination of Hrithik Roshan in “Koi Mil Gaya” and Shah Rukh Khan in “My Name is Khan”. Laxman is good-natured but slow-witted and spends all his time cavorting on the hillside with his beloved brother Bharat (Sohail Khan) and imbibing lessons in “yakeen” (faith) from a visiting Mahatma Gandhi. Good-natured villagers and benevolent guardian Banne Chacha (Om Puri) ensure that Laxman goes through life without too many hurdles, but his idyll is shattered by the 1962 war between India and China. Slideshow (3 Images)The army comes calling for all able-bodied youth to sign up, and Bharat answers the call of duty. Rudderless without his confidant, Laxman finds solace in Guo, the precocious new kid in town. Guo and his mother Li Ling (Chinese actress Zhu Zhu) are second-generation Chinese immigrants who find themselves at the receiving end of hostilities because of the war, but Laxman extends his friendship to the duo, remembering what Banne Chacha had told him - peace can only be achieved if you make friends with the enemy. Adapted from the 2015 Hollywood film “Little Boy”, “Tubelight” is a mostly faithful translation. But at 150 minutes, the film overstretches its run-time by more than half an hour. Director Kabir Khan makes a few relevant points about inclusivity and the growing extremism in today’s society, but he makes the mistake of thinking the audience is as slow on the uptake as his hero is. It feels like the director is spelling out his message, pronouncing it slowly and loudly so that everyone can get it. After a point, it gets tiring. Khan’s Forrest Gump act doesn’t help either, nor does his constant reference to yakeen (faith) and his belief that he can literally move mountains with it (including several scenes where Khan crouches with his hands stretched forward and concentrates on a far-off mountain to try and move it with his will). The rambling screenplay (credited to Kabir Khan and Parveez Shaika) doesn’t seem to have a focal point, Khan’s do-gooder act gets old fast, and you can see the end coming from a mile away. Matin Rey Tangu, who plays Guo, is a ray of sunshine in an otherwise bleak cast. But even his scenes with Khan feel superficial, almost as if they were trying to duplicate the “Bajrangi Bhaijaan” chemistry between Khan and the child actor in that film, Harshaali Malhotra. For all its insistence on faith, the film shows a surprising lack of it – it is all rehearsed, clumsily designed to tug at the heartstrings and endear us to its leading man. This “Tubelight” flickers erratically for a long time and then dies out. ","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/movie-review-tubelight-salman-khan-idUSKBN19E0BG"},

But the revamp is just the first step in an ambitious drive to overhaul shipping in the country, with experts warning that a scheme to dot the sprawling archipelago with a string of new harbors over the next few years could be heading for choppy waters as it still needs billions of dollars in financing.  President Joko Widodo wants Indonesia to become a  global maritime axis , looking to slash logistics costs as the nation competes with neighbors Vietnam and Thailand to be a major regional manufacturing base for automotive and electronics companies including Toyota Motor Corp and Samsung Electronics.  In terms of challenges, locating adequate funding is clearly one of the biggest,  said Turloch Mooney, senior editor for global ports at research provider IHS Markit. Indonesia ranked 63rd out of 160 countries last year on the World Bank's Logistics Performance Index, which measures the ease of trade including the timeliness of shipments, customs performance and infrastructure quality.  The costs of moving goods across one of the world's most populous countries stood at 27 percent of gross domestic product, according to a 2013 study co-written by the World Bank. That compared with 13 percent in Malaysia and 8 percent in Singapore.   Indonesia has an ambitious plan to build or expand a total of 24 ports, though it is unclear what the overall cost would be, with the work largely divvied up between four state-controlled port operators that have their own fundraising plans.  While (these companies) are certainly capable of developing and operating ports, in reality their capacity is limited, particularly in financing large ports,  said Raj Kannan, managing director of infrastructure consultancy Tusk Advisory.  PT Pelabuhan Indonesia II (Pelindo 2), which runs Jakarta's revamped Tanjung Priok port, needs 40-50 trillion rupiah ($3-3.75 billion) over the next three years to build at least three new ports and other infrastructure, said President Director Elvyn G. Masassya. Pelindo 2, which issued $1.6 billion worth of bonds two years ago, is now in talks with potential investors from China and other countries, Masassya said, adding that he was confident the company could raise enough money.

In comparison, the average dwell time at established maritime hub Singapore is only around a day. Manufacturers have long criticized Indonesia's shipping system, saying it slows the import of raw materials and the export of finished products. Anne Patricia Sutanto, a senior executive at garment maker PT Pan Brothers Tbk, said there were not enough shipping lines out of Semarang, a port city on the north of Java island, which it uses for 70 percent of its exports.  Pan Brothers says on its website that its clients include Germany's Adidas and Japan's Uniqlo, owned by Fast Retailing. Nevertheless, some analysts said there was room to be optimistic on the long-term prospects for the overhaul of shipping in Indonesia, with the improvements at Tanjung Priok seen as a good starting point.  The goals are highly ambitious but also very important to the future economic fortunes of the country, and therefore have support within the highest levels of the administration,  said IHS Markit's Mooney.

The five-year yield was up half a basis point at a six-month high of minus 0.070 percent. The benchmark 10-year yield also rose half a basis point, to 0.055 percent. The 30-year yield climbed 1.5 basis points to 0.795 percent, pulling away from a near two-month low of 0.780 percent plumbed on Thursday. The BOJ on Friday offered to buy 100 billion yen ($898.4 million) of JGBs with maturities exceeding 25 years and the bid-to-cover ratio rose to 4.5 from around 3 at the previous auction. The higher bid-to-cover ratio showed that there were more investors willing to sell super long JGBs compared with last week, when the previous operation was conducted. The price rise by super long JGBs this week was in turn seen to have made the maturities more vulnerable to selling by investors. The five-year/20-year JGB yield spread stood at 63.5 basis points from Thursday's 62.5 basis points, which was its narrowest since December. The JGB yield curve tracked the flattening of the U.S. yield this week, although domestic factors also played a role as short to medium term yields rose to multiple-month highs. Short-to-mid-term JGB yields have edged up slowly but steadily over the past few months as the central bank has trimmed the amount of bonds of these maturities it buys. The BOJ has been cutting back its buying of bills and shorter-dated debt at regular JGB-buying operations in an attempt to improve market liquidity, which had practically dried up under its extensive easing scheme. The yield rise, however, has been taken in stride within the JGB market.  The five-year yield may have risen but a sudden spike appears unlikely at the moment, as the 10-year yield further down the curve is anchored near zero percent under the BOJ's policy,  said Naomi Muguruma, senior fixed income strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities. $1 = 111.3100 yen Reporting by the Tokyo markets team; Editing by Jacqueline Wong","url":"http://www.reuters.com/article/japan-bonds-idUSL3N1JK1T4"},

Dozens of residents of Simon Bolivar, a district in the city of Cerro de Pasco in the Peruvian Andes, traveled to Lima to press the government to declare a health emergency and build a regional hospital specializing in exposure to heavy metals.  As a mother it's so painful to see my daughter suffer,  said Sarita Custodio, crying and pointing to rashes on her daughter's face and arms face as she sat chained to the entrance of the health ministry with other parents.  The doctor said it's because of the lead.  Lead, zinc, silver and other metals were mined at Cerro de Pasco for more than 400 years, leaving behind piles of tailings and traces of contaminants in the soil and water that many blame for ailments ranging from cancer to learning disabilities.     Tonnes of it are outside all around and that's what our children and residents have to live with,  said Simon Bolivar Mayor Zumel Trujillo, adding that there were more than 25 contaminated sites in his district alone. More than 40 percent of the area's children who were tested in a 2012 study had dangerously high levels of lead in their blood, according to a screening of some 2,700 children by regional health authorities.

The health ministry said it would emit a decree declaring a health emergency in Cerro de Pasco soon and allocate an immediate budget of about $400,000 to help the sick. Luis Palma, a construction worker from Cerro de Pasco, said all four of his children had lead levels with nine times recommended limits when they were tested a decade ago. Palma said one of his sons died a few years ago after severe stomach problems that he blames on the pollution, and one daughter is so mentally disabled she cannot feed herself.
